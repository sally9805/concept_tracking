On April 25 , 1925 , the first Woman ' s World Fair closed a successful eight-day run at the Furniture Mart on North Lake Shore Drive . The fair , which highlighted women ' s achievements in art , commerce and industry , attracted more than 200 , 000 visitors , presented more than 100 exhibitions of women in business and earned a net income of $50 , 000 . The fair was the brainchild of Helen Bennett , manager of the Chicago Collegiate Bureau of Occupations and author of " Women and Work . " Her idea , conceived two years earlier , was to organize a fair to show not only what women had already done but what they could still do . Bennett was a pioneer of the women ' s movement . In an age when women in the workplace were still considered a novelty if not an anomaly , she was demanding comparable pay for comparable work . " Women are quicker to learn than men and in all ways able to do men ' s work , " she once said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not blind to reality , acknowledging in the same speech that women were " 35 percent poorer than men in the money they receive and in the opportunities for advancement . " In the Women ' s Republican Club of Chicago Bennett found kindred spirits to support her pioneering ideas . According to Muriel Beadle in " The Fortnightly of Chicago : The City and Its Women 1873-1973 , " prominent members of the club persuaded President Calvin Coolidge to open , via a radio hookup , the first women ' s fair . This he did amid some sonorous competition for attention from a noisy cow , thanks to club member Ruth Hanna McCormick , who had rented a large corner in the exhibition hall and as a publicity ploy brought in the cow , much to the dismay of several of her colleagues . Ironically , the cow became a hit of the fair . " Mrs. McCormick had persuaded President Coolidge to open the fair by radio , which was at that time an almost unheard of event , " remarked chairwoman Louise deKoven Bowen . " Afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Woman ' s World Fair , but it seems I was only ballyhooing Ruthie ' s cow . ' " The other big hit of the 1925 fair was a woman named Lillian Tolbert , a young black inventor who designed the Tolbert ice pitcher . " And the only man who has ever had anything to do with it , " she boasted , " was the attorney in the patent office at Washington . " Held again on each of the next four years , the fair attracted more and more exhibitors . The 1928 fair , held at the Coliseum , had some 250 booths displaying women ' s endeavors that ranged from architecture , dentistry and engineering to banking , publishing and printing . On the lighter side , there were evening and afternoon musical programs ; talks on a different subject every day-on health , savings , fashion ; sessions with fortune-tellers ; and various demonstrations , such as how to make gifts from flour sacks . The fair acquired an international flavor , too , when nine foreign countries-Denmark , Greece , Germany , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ukraine-sent exhibits of their crafts and products . Famous speakers who attended the fairs included Katherine Stinson , one of the first American woman aviators ; Fanny Butcher , The Tribune ' s literary columnist ; Jane Addams , social worker and founder of Hull House ; Sophonisba Breckinridge , feminist and staunch defender of women ' s rights ; and Viola Smith , owner and operator of a mine in Santa Fe . The men who came to the fairs , and there were many , kept a low profile and were on their best behavior , prompting one woman to muse , " Our husbands think they are holding the reins , but the women usually know where the wagon is going . " Despite their success , the fairs served to focus attention on the still- lowly status of women , particularly in Illinois . " In no other state in the Union does woman , in spite of her artistic and industrial skill , occupy quite so low a position politically and governmentally as she does in Illinois , " said one speaker at the 1927 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her past has been . " What the fairs proposed-that women question their traditional role in society , discover themselves and seek employment if they so desired-may be commonplace today , but to the women of the 1920s , it was all quite new and radical . And well ahead of her times was Helen Bennet , who died in 1962 at age 83 in East Providence , R.I.
