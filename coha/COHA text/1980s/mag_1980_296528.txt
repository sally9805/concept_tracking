GUYANA TRAGEDY : THE STORY OF JIM JONES April 15 and 16 , CBS , 9 p.m . E.S.T. <P> It is hardball time in network land . For the first time in four seasons , CBS has a real chance at regaining the ratings championship it lost to ABC in early 1976 . Since the two networks are now in a dead heat , they are unleashing an arsenal of stunts before the season officially ends April 20 . ABC has moved up the annual Academy Award telecast ( April 14 ) to an earlier starting hour , 9 p.m . E.S.T. , so that more of that perennial ratings juggernaut will play during prime time . ABC will also rerun the hit movie The Sting on April 20 , ahead of schedule . Not to be ambushed , CBS has slipped in Guyana Tragedy : The Story of Jim Jones , a two-part TV movie , just before the closing of the ratings season . Should this show prove a smash one-two punch , CBS may once more be known as " the Tiffany of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapted by Ernest Tidyman from the Washington Post 's quickie book on the Jonestown massacre , is as refined as it can be under the circumstances . There are some name actors ( Ned Beatty , Colleen Dewhurst , LeVar Burton , James Earl Jones , Veronica Cartwright ) in the cast , though several only have walk-on roles . The re-creations of the story 's pivotal events are skillful enough to jog one 's memories of the infamous TV news footage . Yet CBS may have erred on the side of caution . The movie 's lengthy , dutiful depictions of Jones ' early years &shy; as a child in Indiana , as a civil libertarian preacher in Indianapolis and the San Francisco area &shy; provide too many unassimilated facts and details . There really is no point in recounting the minutiae of a madman 's life if , after four hours , it is still impossible to understand how Jones became a sex-and-drug-crazed megalomaniac or why his misfit followers so easily accepted his larcenous and sadistic behavior . <P> Most of the action in Guyana occurs in the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a climax that makes Dallas look like Washington Square : having already had an affair with a married female follower ( Diana Scarwid ) , Jones starts to make love to the woman 's husband ( Brad Dourif ) as she looks on . One 's mind reels merely in contemplation of the efforts it no doubt took to get the scene past the network 's censors . In Part 2 , things get going when Congressman Leo Ryan ( Beatty ) arrives to investigate the Peoples Temple . The airstrip murders and subsequent mass suicides are as graphic as one can stomach . <P> The eerieness of the final slaughter is heightened not only by its verisimilitude , but by the movie 's one extraordinary performance . A young actor named Powers Boothe captures all the paranoia , sexual magnetism , hysteria , rage and even intelligence of " Dad " Jim Jones . His final incantations to the dying &shy; delivered in a feverish but strangely disembodied voice &shy; create a more deathly mood than all the corpses piling up onscreen . If Writer Tidyman had only matched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tragedy would be as notable as drama as it is as ratings gambit.
