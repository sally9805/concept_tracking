A word for those who may be arriving late : this book is a sequel to A Child Called Noah ( 1972 ) and A Place for Noah ( 1978 ) . Like its predecessors , A Client Called Noah takes shape as a journal kept by Novelist and Screenwriter Josh Greenfeld . He jots down information about himself , his Japanese wife Foumi and their first son Karl . But the day-to-day entries never stray very far from Noah , the second son , who is severely brain damaged . <P> Greenfeld the father knows his family has been visited by a private tragedy ; Greenfeld the writer understands that the ordeal of caring for Noah calls into question everything that passes for normal . Extreme situations clarify the muddles of the middle ground . The author , past 50 and worried about his blocked coronary artery , asks himself , " What do I want out of life ? " and answers , " ' Life itself . ' Which really , for alleged sophistication of my brain , puts me in Noah 's shoes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine ? " <P> From January 1977 to November 1980 , Greenfeld records what goes on in his house in Pacific Palisades , Calif . Both sons enter their teens , and Karl , who gets there first , begins outraging his father with typical adolescent behavior . After one acrimonious argument , the author manages a desperate joke : " This family could be worse . Noah could be normal . " But Noah is not . " It is no fun , " Greenfeld notes , " to have him pull hair right out of your scalp and then put it in his mouth and swallow it . " And Noah is growing physically , if not mentally . Someday soon the parents will not be able to control him . <P> But they do not want their child spending his life in the " back ward of a state hospital . " So the Greenfelds vacillate over " what to do about Noah . " Gallows humor provides occasional refuge . The entry for June 15 , 1980 , reads in its entirety : " I 've spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang the rap on Karl . " <P> No happy endings seem promised here , but a final chapter and postscript provide several , including the awarding last year of Japan 's most prestigious literary prize to Foumi for a book about the experiences of a mother with a handicapped child . And Noah has found a place , not only in real life but in the minds of those who , thanks to his parents , have come to know him .
