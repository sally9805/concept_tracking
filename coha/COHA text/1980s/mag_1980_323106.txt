Faced with that future , Featherless fights back <P> Just before Jimmy Carter met last week with auto industry leaders , TIME Contributor John Skow received a phone call from his friend Featherless , the pundit who wants the Democrats to nominate Franklin Delano Roosevelt and argues that , given the rest of the field , no one will notice that he is dead . Featherless had an equally practical proposal for solving two economic problems-the nation 's and his own . <P> " I ' ve got it all figured out , " said Feathlerless , in a voice that rang with self-approval . <P> " Yorgumfoom ? " I said , yawning heavily , because it was nearly 2 a.m . " The presidential campaign ? " <P> " Nope , I 've withdrawn from politics . The Democratic National Committee stopped taking collect calls . " <P> " Your credit-card mess ? " Featherless had been despondent the last time I saw him , because Visa , MasterCard and American Express had taken away his plastic money . " I 've been declared a cardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his backyard grill on his head . " I 'm a man without a card . " He had the haunted look of a traveler condemned to shuttle reservationless between Marriott and Holiday Inn , with no Magic Fingers to strum his backbone . <P> " Nah , " said Featherless . " I overreacted to that . I was going to take out a loan and pay all my charge-card bills , even though they were only three months overdue . Then I realized that the Government will handle it all . " <P> " You mean a sheriff 's sale ? " I knew how much Featherless prized his chattel , especially his condo at Yosemite Apts. and his Tempura sports car , with a five-speed balance of payments . <P> " Certainly not , " he said with dignity . " It 'll be like after World War I , when they had all those refugees whose countries did n't exist any more . The authorities had to give them some sort of document so that they could cross borders , be taxed , and take out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " * <P> " That 's it . Well , I happen to know that the Administration is going to do the same thing for us refugees of the credit wars . Simplistic Systems , the famous Washington Think Tank , did the planning on this one . " <P> " How does it work ? " <P> " Nothing to it . If MasterCard cuts your air hose , the Government comes to the rescue with a Nansen Credit Card-a Cartercard , they 're calling it-and you 're back in the stores without missing a beat . " <P> " But it was Carter 's idea to tighten credit in the first place . " <P> " Well , sure , but you ca n't run an economy with the cash people have left over after paying the rent . " <P> " I would n't want to try . " It was getting late , and I had to be at the town hall early to sign up for liquor stamps . " Look , thanks for calling , and ... " <P> " I have n't told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , yawning again . <P> " It 's macroeconomic , " said Featherless , with understandable pride . <P> " I should hope so . " <P> " Now listen , what 's the worst economic problem we have ? " <P> That was easy . " They do n't make a good 5 dollar any more . "
