In the Mondale camp , there is hope that the worst is past <P> Call it fantasy , wishful thinking , whistling in a graveyard . But Walter Mondale and his planners believe that the Democratic nominee has passed the low point of his presidential campaign and is poised to move up . One or two less self-interested observers suspect that they just might be right . <P> The most visible signs , to be sure , point in the opposite direction . Polls have never looked gloomier for Democrats : a national survey by NBC News , published last week , showed Ronald Reagan leading Mondale by an astonishing 62% to 32% . Press coverage of the campaign is still predominantly funereal in tone . A sample headline from the New York Times , over a story about the attitudes of Democrats running for state or local Offices : SOME CANDIDATES FEAR MONDALE 'S VISITS . The nominee is having trouble these days simply making himself heard over the jeers of pro-Reagan hecklers who now turn up at almost every campaign stop . Chants of " Mondale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democratic candidate gave in Los Angeles last week to students at the University of Southern California . <P> Why , then , the belief that the worst is over ? " Mostly instinct , " said Mondale in a campaign-plane interview with TIME . " I think the crowds are more excited . I think I 'm getting my arguments across . " He referred to an endorsement by the Sierra Club , the first in that environmentalist organization 's 92-year history . He also pointed to the success of his running mate , Geraldine Ferraro , in getting Chicago 's feuding Democrats , Mayor Harold Washington and Councilman Edward Vrdolyak , to share a platform with her in a display of party unity . Said Mondale : " I think that means something . I think there 's evidence that we 're starting to move . " <P> There are some other signs too . <P> Scheduling and advance work have improved after a disastrous start that was symbolized by a Mondale visit to a factory in Green Bay , Wis. , two weeks ago : he had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to shake hands . At a meeting with top aides in Tupelo , Miss. , following the fiasco , Mondale demanded that they stop arranging " cutesie " photo opportunities and schedule only " substantive forums " at which he could talk issues to live audiences . He also ordered longtime Aide Mike Berman to take tighter control of advance work . The result : crowds turned out last week and microphones worked , as at times they had not during earlier Mondale appearances .
