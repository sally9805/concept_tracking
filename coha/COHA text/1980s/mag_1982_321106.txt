The new unemployment rate : 8.9% . Everyone who hears that percentage will know it is fraught with troublesome forebodings . Yet the modern habit of mistaking statistics for reality makes it easy to overlook the fact that the rate stands for an indigestibly large number of individuals- 9.5 million . Each point in the unemployment rate also represents , as the President explained last month , roughly $19 billion in potential but lost federal revenues , plus some $6 billion in financial assistance that the Government disburse jobless . Such statistical and elaborations usefully suggest the vast scope of unemployment and its staggering cost in both forfeited wealth and rescue efforts . Yet it is essential to remember that statistics tell nothing whatever about the reality of joblessness . <P> That reality is always personal and almost always lashed with a confusion of difficult emotions . Indeed , the psychological cost of joblessness is more hurtful to many victims than the strain of making financial ends meet . A few individuals , true enough , are so oddly disposed that they can take unemployment with upbeat nonchalance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to switch careers . Still , Americans more typically take a cruel psychic bruising when they lose a job ( never mind the cause ) . And if joblessness goes on for long , men and women of all ages , occupations and economic classes tend to suffer a sharp loss of selfesteem , a diminished sense of identity , a certain murkiness of purpose , a sense of estrangement from their friends-a sort of feeling of exile from wherever they feel they really belong . <P> The loss of a job remains , by definition , an economic event . Naturally , it is the economic aspect of the world of the jobless that has become most familiar to the public : the struggle to pay the rent and keep food on the table , the suspenseful search for new work . The intangible atmosphere of the jobless world is less familiar only because it is ordinarily more private , often downright obscure . The most obvious personal wounds of joblessness are often easy to spot , as in the language of Ronald Poindexter , 34 , a Washington bricklayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick . " But the profound wrench of unemployment is not often disclosed as plainly as in the reflection of Connie Cerrito , 52 , of New York City , who last July lost the cosmetics factory position she had held for 35 years . Says Cerrito : " My job was my whole life . That 's all I did . It 's unbearable now . Staying home is terrible . I ca n't go on like this . " <P> Common among the jobless is a sense of being condemned to uselessness in a world that worships the useful . Out-of-work people who do not develop such feelings on their own are apt to be given them when they visit the unemployment office : there the applicant is more often treated like an alien culprit in need of interrogation than an unlucky citizen in need of assistance . Says a young writer who was among the anonymous hundreds that Harry Maurer taped for the oral history Not Working : " I always get the feeling that the people at the umemployment office think I 'm a bum or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welder. of the umemployment rites : " You get a feeling of rejection . Especially the feeling that they 're better than you . "
