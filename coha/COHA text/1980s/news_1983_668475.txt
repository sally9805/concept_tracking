TEGUCIGALPA , Honduras - Hondurans of many political stripes say they were at first amazed and are now worried about playing host to what appears to be the most ambitious covert operation by the American CIA in Latin America in a decade . Reports in the American press over the past week have given evidence that the Reagan Administration has spent about $19.5 million a year since November 1981 to arm , train and support a guerrilla force estimated at anywhere from 2000 to 7000 rebels , whose stated intention is to overthrow the Sandinista government in Nicaragua . The counterrevolutionaries , or " contras " as they are dubbed locally , launched a push into Nicaragua in late March from camps on the Honduran side of the border . The details of US support for the counterrevolutionary operation were not public until last week . But the presence of the contra camps has been what one local journalist called " the worst-kept secret " in Honduras since mid-1982 . Speaking with reporters who traveled to the southern border , peasants often spoke of coming upon columns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading cattle they had brought back from forays into Nicaragua . Residents of villages all along the border found themselves waking regularly to the thud of Nicaraguan mortars and the crackling of Honduran semiautomatic rifles , as border skirmishes multiplied . Usually it was never clear who started what . But the villagers said they learned that the Nicaraguan mortars often were aimed at contra bands escaping to the safety of Honduran territory . The Honduran government denies that counterrevolutionaries are operating in Honduras . The Honduran military says the border is too long - 300 miles - for it to patrol effectively . But the fighting has started a debate among both civilians and military over whether Honduras is sturdy enough politically to act as a base for the US-backed contra operation . " We are a trampoline with weak springs , " said one prominent conservative Honduran lawyer , a former Cabinet minister . He used to speak openly , he said , but amidst quickening rumors of war with Nicaragua , he asked that his name not be used . " We ' re surprised , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get us into this mess . " Honduras , the only Central American nation whose main export crop is still bananas , is only barely integrated into a single nation . The eastern third of the country is a treeless , tropical flatland inhabited by 35,000 Miskito Indians and not connected by any road to the rest of the country . As recently as Lempira , was a sleepy pit stop for fishing boats where the owner of the only restaurant , the plump and motherly Dona Marina , served eggs right after they were laid by the chickens out back . In the wake of two joint US-Honduran military exercises there , in August 1982 and last February , Puerto Lempira now has a 3000-yard airplane runway , a new army battalion and new radar equipment . American Ambassador John Negroponte says United States policy in Honduras is to support a fledgling electoral system and a crippled economy , as well as building Honduras ' defenses against Nicaragua . The United States sent $85 million in economic aid and $31.2 million in military aid to Honduras in 1982 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 years of military rule and go to elections in October 1981 . In an upset , a liberal , Roberto Suazo Cordova , won . But Hondurans have found that the Reagan Administration ' s powerful aversion to the Sandinista government in Nicaragua dominates its policy here . The civilians still have not been able to take political control from the military in national security matters . Recently , Suazo and the head of the armed forces , Gen. Gustavo Alvarez Martinez , had a rare chance encounter with the press . Suazo , a portly man of few words , stepped out of one side of a jeep , to say " Honduras is a peaceful country . Tell Nicaragua that if they do not harm us , we have no interest in war with them . " From the other side of the jeep stepped Alvarez , in dark glasses , combat boots and full camouflage uniform . He accused the Sandinista government of intending to attack Honduras at its borders and by supporting internal guerrilla movements . " We will do everything we can to defend ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States a chance to prove that it ' s willing to support us , " he said . According to reports in major US newspapers and news magazines describing the contra operation , it ' s directed by Negroponte working closely with Alvarez . Suazo did not participate , and no officials of the elected Congress were consulted . There have been risks in relying heavily on the Honduran military . Under the previous regime of Gen. Policarpo Paz Garcia , high- ranking Honduran officers were extensively involved in drug and arms smuggling to the United States and many were demoted for these crimes after the change of government . One colonel in Tegucigalpa said this week that corruption had diminished under Alvarez ' command . But he said that officers of the Honduran navy continued to take kickbacks on commercial shipments coming through northern ports . He also said some battalion commanders still take extra earnings by reporting 50 or 60 more men on their staff than are actually on duty . Alvarez himself has proved to be a strong-headed and often highly independent ally . He has often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military spending in Honduras . About 95 percent of the US aid is in the form of military sales credits , to be repaid at 15 percent interest . Last year , Alvarez pressed the United States for 12 F5 jet fighter planes . They would have cost $150 million , or more than the Honduran military budget for the last three years . The general , trained in Argentina , reorganized part of his army along Argentine lines and fell back on Argentine advisers when relations were tense with the United States . As Alvarez ' concern about Nicaraguan attacks has grown , Honduran liberals feared the armed forces might end up leaning on local political opposition . On Friday morning , about 50 relatives of Hondurans who have disappeared here since early 1982 marched in a tight circle with placards in front of the National Congress , the second of what are now planned as weekly protests . Forty-two Hondurans and 76 foreigners have vanished here after being detained by army or police . The most recent victim was a law student , Ines Consuelo Murillo , 24 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Choloma , in northwestern Honduras , on March 13 . Her parents say they believe she was transferred March 15 to Tegucigalpa by police intelligence agents . She has been unaccounted for since . Underlying the political tensions , and also restraining the growth of the army , is Honduras ' acute economic crisis . The country is shouldering a $1.2 billion foreign debt and negative economic growth for the third year in a row . Economists ' estimates of hard unemployment run to 30 percent with underemployment as high as 67 percent . A recent study funded by the US government shows that poor people in Tegucigalpa suffered a 50 percent loss in real annual income between 1980 and 1983 . Because of the austerity , Honduras ' labor unions , by far the strongest of any Central American country , are growing restive . On March 29 , after 18 months of friction with their company , four labor leaders , including a well-known leftist union president , Dagoberto Padilla , were shot to death in the northern province of Yoro . In confessions made public Tuesday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ups " in the company - a Honduran agribusiness firm named CAGSA - to carry out the killings . Honduran officials fear these internal conflicts could get worse if the country is hemmed in on two sides by countries at war . Already , Honduras is giving shelter to about 48,000 refugees , including some 30,000 from El Salvador and 16,000 from Nicaragua . Nearly 1000 Indian refugees pushed across the border last week , fleeing combat in northern Nicaragua . " Whatever sympathy there was for the Sandinistas right after the revolution of 1979 , most Hondurans have lost it , " said a newspaper editor . However , there seems to be a feeling of helplessness here about the prospect of open war with Nicaragua . " We have the feeling that the future of Honduras is now being determined by the contras fighting in the jungles of northern Nicaragua , " said the conservative lawyer . " If the contras win , we will probably face a long period of harsh right-wing rule . If they lose , the Sandinistas will probably be radicalized against the nation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he predicted .
