THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment ASTRANGE double game is going on in Washington , D.C. , these days with regard to the Reagan Administration 's Nicaragua policy . In the first aspect of this game , we are witnessing a rhetorical offensive of extreme intensity , spearheaded by the President 's performance at his news conference on February 21st , when he celebrated the Contras as " freedom fighters and lovers of freedom and democracy , " while characterizing the Sandinista regime as " a Communist totalitarian state . " When he was asked point-blank whether the goal of his policy was now the overthrow of the Sandinista government , the President replied , " Well , remove it in the sense of its present structure . " Secretary of State George Shultz , the next day , elaborated on the remark about removing the " present structure " of the Sandinista regime , stating that it was immaterial to him how this was accomplished  --  that the government in Managua could do it on its own or through agreement with other countries , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Sandinista regime . " This sort of rhetoric has proved effective in terrifying the Nicaraguans and satisfying the ideological convictions of the President 's conservative supporters around the country and in Congress . But at least some members of the Administration seem to realize that it wo n't do as a means of changing crucial " moderate " votes in Congress votes that the Administration must have if it is to reverse last year 's congressional suspension of aid to the Contras . Those moderates might well turn squeamish at an outright declaration that it has become our policy to engineer the spontaneous " collapse " of another sovereign government ; furthermore , they tend to recall ( to the annoyance of the Administration ) that the initial rationale for aiding the Contras was considerably more circumscribed . Hence , there has developed a need for a second track in the Administration 's Nicaragua public-relations offensive . This approach was previewed in a remarkable article by Doyle McManus , published in the Los Angeles Times on February 16th . McManus , reporting on a conversation he 'd had with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he identified by name  --  in this instance , " a senior State Department official " ? quoted the official as admitting that " the Reagan Administration has abandoned its claim that aid to Nicaraguan rebels is justified because the insurgents intercept arms shipments to El Salvador . " According to McManus , the official said that the Reagan Administration " plans to ask Congress to renew such assistance on the grounds that military pressure is needed to force the leftist Managua regime to negotiate . " According to McManus , the official explained , " We have shifted the emphasis , " and he also " indicated that the Administration believes that moderate Democrats may back funding for the rebels if it is presented as a means of expediting peace talks in the area , rather than as a secret war against the Sandinista regime . " Well , you can shift any emphasis you like , you can present anything as anything else , but in the end you 're left with a policy . In this case , the policy involves funding and waging a surrogate war against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that came to power as the result of an overwhelmingly popular and broad-based revolution a few years back , which unseated our previous client-surrogate in the region , Anastasio Somoza , a man whose regime was generally regarded as one of the cruellest and least democratic in the hemisphere . Notwithstanding , McManus reported that his source " said the U.S. objective is to foster ' a process of reconciliation ' between the Managua regime and the rebels , " and McManus went on , " Such a process , he said , requires more than the amnesty the Sandinistas have already offered ; it must include a reorganization of Nicaragua 's domestic political system to allow the rebels to participate in government . " For the time being , let 's not worry about the question of our right to make that sort of demand concerning the domestic affairs of any other sovereign country , or try to figure out how we would feel and how we would respond if another nation started telling us how to run our own domestic political system . And let 's not talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of demand of Nicaragua while working to undermine the very possibility of such a reorganization in El Salvador  --  claiming that those rebels must not be allowed to " shoot their way " into the government . Let 's not bother comparing the human-rights record of the regime in San Salvador , our ally , with that of the regime in Managua , our enemy  --  or , for that matter , the democratic standing of the regime in Managua with that of its predecessor , the regime of our client Somoza , whose excesses never seemed to fluster most of the current critics of the Sandinistas . Let 's ignore for the moment the fact that last year we were denouncing the Sandinistas for their hesitancy in cooperating with the Contadora process  --  the peacemaking initiative sponsored by four neighboring Latin-American countries  --  right up to the day ( September 21st ) when the Sandinistas surprised us by agreeing to accept " immediately and without further modifications " the revised draft of the group 's proposed peace treaty , at which point it was we who suddenly reversed field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiations . Let 's also pass over for the moment the by now well-documented pattern of atrocities committed by our surrogate forces , the Contras , in the Nicaraguan countryside  --  the pattern , for example , that involves singling out teachers and doctors for assassination and schools and clinics for demolition during raids on remote villages , as part of a declared policy of undermining the country 's infrastructure . ( That Contra strategy may have derived in part from the fact that the Sandinistas were able to boast of a thirty-seven-per-cent increase in literacy and a thirty-eight-per-cent decrease in the infant-mortality rate in just five short years . ) And let 's not get too exercised over President Reagan 's fanciful recasting of history , his notion , for example , that the Contras , those freedom lovers , started out as " other elements of that revolution , " onetime allies whose share in the revolution 's triumph the Sandinistas somehow managed to wrest away , when in fact a significant number , if not the majority , of the senior officers in the principal Contra army were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution 's staunchest and most long-standing opponents . For that matter , let 's suspend , if only for the moment , any consideration at all of what 's actually going on today in Central America . Instead , let 's focus on what 's going on in our own democracy , on the assault being made on our own domestic political system . Congress ( made up of our own representatives , after all ) is being asked not only to jettison the entire rationale for an ongoing policy but to forget that that rationale ever existed . " The objective was never interdiction of arms bound for El Salvador as such , " McManus quotes another State Department official as admitting . " There 's no such thing as an interdiction program . You ca n't do it . We learned that in Vietnam . . The agency the C.I.A. never should have used that word . It was a mistake from the start . " Our congressmen are being asked to replace that rationale with another  --  at least as flimsy and as liable to be cast off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of Congress is being asked to buy the new rationale . Conservatives can accept the Reagan of the first track at his word . No , the second version is reserved for those moderates whose votes the Administration needs . Basically , the pitch beneath the pitch goes something like this : " Look , we know you might like to support aid to the Contras fur all sorts of reasons  --  power politics , ideology , fear of being blamed for ' the loss of Nicaragua ' ? hut you ca n't bring yourself to do it for those reasons . You need a disguise , some noble reason that you can deceive yourself into believing is the actual reason . So how about this one ? " Vietnam taught us many lessons besides the futility of interdiction . It also taught us about the fragility of our own democracy , and what happens when " moderates " begin to tell themselves stories about their motives and then begin to act on the stories instead of on the motives  --  begin to convince themselves that the stories are true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets of books  --  not just the way CBS said that General Westmoreland did but the way a lot of moderates now realize that they were doing as they continued to support the war long after misgivings started to nag them . Vietnam taught us about the political consequences of bad faith . Jean-Paul Sartre once dissected this phenomenon of bad faith . He wrote about the way a human being ? any human being , himself included ? can sometimes deceive himself about his motives . But he went on to note , " I must know in my capacity as deceiver the truth which is hidden from me in my capacity as the one deceived . Better yet I must know the truth very exactly in order to conceal it more carefully  --  and this not at two different moments , which at a pinch would allow us to reestablish a semblance of duality  --  but in the unitary structure of a single project . " And Vietnam taught , as Sartre taught , that ultimately that sort of absolute self-deception absolutely corrodes the integrity and the stability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " T WAS watching TV the other 1 night , " said L. D. Frazier , who was sitting on three phone books and a piano stool  --  high enough up that he could look every member of his audience in the eye . " This evangelist came on . I wo n't say his name , but he was a big evangelist . And he was saying something like ' My uncle 's in Hell . He had a massive heart attack and he died , and I know he went to Hell , because he believed in slot machines . And now he wants a glass of water so bad . ' " Frazier paused , and wiped away the sweat that was collecting in " Congratulations ! Burke 's Peerage has traced you back to William the Conqueror ? ' great quivering beads on his shaved head , and then he said , " If you ask me , that 's crazy . " And then he started to play gospel music on an upright piano  --  a concert-cum-monologue that lasted hours . " I 'm not here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . " I 'm only here to warm them up . " Cool remains something of an ideal in this city . We know people who if , let 's say , they were contestants on " Wheel of Fortune , " on Channel 2 , and , say , they guessed the hidden phrase ? maybe it was " Seen the Rousseau show yet ? " ? and they got a new Ford Thunderbird and the flatware . No hollering  --  they 'd just turn to the well-groomed host , Pat Sajak , and say , " Thank you , Pat . Let 's get together for dinner sometime soon . " Probably Mr. Frazier 's audience at the New York Open Center ( a SoHo institution that usually offers courses in awareness and massage from an Eastern perspective ) included several such souls . But before the evening had barely begun , this large man at a small piano had converted them  --  everyone was stamping his or her feet and rocking back and forth , and once or twice Mr. Frazier even had to say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words on this one . " In between " This Little Light of Mine " and " His Love Keeps Me in a Wonderful Kind of Way " and " What Folk Say About Me ( Wo n't Keep Me Out of Heaven ) , " Mr. Frazier , who takes his show to Egypt next month , delivered a. short history of the music of the black church . " When the slaves came over , they were purposely divided from the rest of their tribe , so the tribal religions diminished , " he said . " Still , the fervor was there , and the belief in deities , so they said to themselves , ' If they 're going to force us to be Christians , we 'll make it work for us , ' and they started singing spirituals . After the slaves were emancipated , there was a bit more freedom , so there was a bit more fervor . " That was the age of the jubilee : songs more up-tempo than the spirituals but not as ecstatic or as personal as the gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ghettos . " The father of gospel music , Dr. Thomas A. Dorsey , is in his mid-eighties now , " said Frazier . " He was a blues composer and piano player , and he used to back up Ma Rainey , among others . He had a tragic death in his family , and he began to write music of a more spiritual bent . And it spread . " As he played , Frazier grimaced till his eyes slid shut , and he bobbed his head and banged away . " In gospel , the piano becomes like a drum . I use it like a percussion instrument , " he said . " But my favorite gospel song is one of the slower numbers  --  Dr. Dorsey 's Precious Lord , Take My Hand . ' Such feeling . I have a lot of fun in church , smiling , laughing . It 's hard to explain , because how can you talk about a feeling ? You can intellectualize about it , but it 's better just to feel it . " ? EVEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work being a philosopher . An inventor , for instance , can sit in the kitchen and ponder his blender and say to himself , " It blends , but might n't it knead ? Might n't it julienne ? " And soon he has built a food processor , and patent lawyers have beaten a path to his door , and he is rich , and all America is dicing car rots so busily that , laid end to end , an hour 's worth would stretch from here to there , no matter where there was . ( The carrot juice , interestingly , would fill the Mariana Trench to nearly the same height achieved by the French motorcycle-jump stylist Alain Jean Prieur on an average day . ) A philosopher , on the other hand , might spend years pondering happiness  --  a philosophical equivalent of the blender  --  and then write a book that garnered good reviews ( a few caveats but generally warm ) , and no one would be happier , not even the philosopher , probably . Market forces do not prevail ; man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll screw up as fast as the next guy . This we realized one day last week when we talked to Johnny Maestro , lead singer of The Brooklyn Bridge and a man whose career puts a question mark after the declaration " ' T is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all . " Johnny Maestro concertized at the South Street Seaport ( in the shadow of the actual Brooklyn Bridge ) last week ; afterward , he told us about his life in music . " I started back around 1956 , singing with a group of neighborhood guys , " he said . " Our neighborhood was lower Manhattan  --  the Alfred E. Smith projects , near Madison Street . We started singing together just for fun ; we 'd sing everywhere we went  --  on the streets , on the subway trains . One time , a woman came up to us on the subway and gave us the business card of some bandleader , and that led to our signing on with a new label called Joyce Records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Brooklyn . Our first song was My Juanita , ' and the flip side was Sweetest One . ' They were typical fifties songs  --  talking about the girl I love . ' They were all fun songs back then , no deep meaning . We made another record , and then the company folded . And eventually we went to another new company  --  we were the first act on the Coed record label , and our first song , Pretty Little Angel , ' was a local hit . The second thing we did there was ' 16 Candles , ' and that was national  --  that sold more than a million records . My name came about a year later , when the company decided to put me out in front of the group , which was the Crests . My name was John Mastrangelo . It was n't a very groovy name , so they kind of cut it down a bit , to Mastro , but everyone mispronounced that , usually as Maestro , ' so that 's what we made it . Anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our sales started to diminish . " Maestro worked on his own for a while after that , and then , in the late sixties , joined the Del-Satins . " We combined with another group and became an eleven-piece band , " he said . " We got our new name because all the other hands then were like four or five guys , and the management people said , It 's going to be hard to sell a group this big . It 'd be easier to sell the Brooklyn Bridge . ' So that 's what we called ourselves . Our first record , in 1968 , ' The Worst That Could Happen , ' went to the top . We started performing all the national shows , and the hits followed , but none were as big , and our sales started to dwindle down until 1970 , when we left the record company , because we did n't feel it was promoting us as well as it should have . We started recording on our own  --  with no success , of course . " Audiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Seaport gig was standing room only , and a revival of interest in fifties and sixties music provides nearly enough work , if no particular Fame . " Both times we were huge  --  with ' 16 Candles ' and The Worst That Could Ilappen ' ? I did n't realize what was happening until it was all over , I did n't realize we were on a deTHE NEW YORKER. 37 dine , " Maestro told us . " Both times , it seemed like poor promotion to me , poor management  --  the talent was there . " Right now , The Brooklyn Bridge is re-recording " Lonely Teardrops , " an old Jackie Wilson song . " We 've got a major record company i n tereste d  --  I 'm not going to say which one ? and we hope it 'll be out by summer , and we hope it 'll take off up the charts . Always hopeful . " Frenzy I liTERATURE overflows with descriptions of calves and ponies and kittens and puppies entering the world . Usually , they mewl , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the world quizzically through closed eyes , and somehow they recognize their mothers . Often , this is because their mother is the only large creature in the area , except for the writer , who stays out of the way , since the whole point is that birth is a wonder of nature . Granted , it happens a lot , but it never fails to impress us . Much rarer , much harder to find and capture in print , is the birth of a trend , a phenomenon . When a calf is born , you can say with some confidence that it will grow into a cow . But when someone first hung a pair of fuzzy dice from his rearview mirror it was quite likely  --  we would have given odds  --  that nobody else would hang a pair of fuzzy dice from his rearview mirror . We ourself may well have played the harmonica while showering , but without its becoming a trend . It was merely an event . Calf  --  cow . Kitten  --  cat . Event  --  trend , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappear into the existential abyss , they may hit the bottom , but they make no sound , unless they are very hig . Like , for instance , the Spruce Goose , which everyone knew about , even though no one else built a huge plywood plane that could barely fly . ) All this is a prelude to our own announcement , herewith , of the birth , just perhaps , of a trend . It is beige . It is round . It is a fritter . This trend got off to a slow start one night last month when not very many reporters expressed an interest in attending a " fritter festival " at Rogers &; Barbero , a restaurant in Chelsea ; the press party , in fact , turned into a dinner for four  --  Rogers ( Pat ) , Barber() ( Bob ) , a friend of theirs , and us . Rogers said that he had grown up in Wichita Falls , Texas . " The last big trend was mesquite , " he went on . " Where I came from , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bush , right between the sidewalk and the curb , and my father would cut it back every year . It was a plague  --  the thorns and all . You 'd ride your hike right into ft . I have to tell you , any kind of wood soaked in water intensifies your smoke . At the moment , mesquite is out and grapevines are gaining . It 's a hook . Everyone 's looking for a hook . " Rogers &; Barbero chose to promote fritters because they like them . " What we need to think about is , What do we think of when we say ' fritters ' ? " said Rogers . " A fritter is anything with batter that gets fried . I can remember my grandmother making doughnuts  --  delicious doughnuts . I guess everyone remembers things like that . One of my fondest memories is when we 'd catch catfish and my other grandmother would make hush puppies , which are , of course , a type of fritter . " One thing going for fritters , then , is the ancestor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pasta fritters . Barbero said , " They 're light , like paprika fritters . Or chow-mein noodles . In fact , chow-mein noodles are fritters . When you stop to think of it , there 're a lot more fritters than you at first realize . " " Yes , " said Rogers . " The waffle , actually , is a fritter . You have to grease the waffle iron , or else the waflles 'll burn , so essentially you 're cooking with oil . " The fritter family also includes beignets , croquettes , timbales , and fried pies , which brings us to a third and final point in their favor  --  they taste , you know , good .
