Bullets and rocks fly as truckers try to block new taxes <P> It started out as a nationwide protest against higher fuel taxes and highway-user fees for trucks . But within hours , violence eclipsed the issues . Shortly after 11 p.m. on the first day of the Independent Truckers Association ( ITA ) strike , George Franklin Capps , 34 , a Teamster driver , lay slumped in the cab of his 18-wheeler on Route 701 , north of tiny Newton Grove , N.C. , fatally shot in the neck by a sniper . " The strike is the last thing we talked about , " recalled his widow Esmond . " I told him to be careful . " <P> Indeed , care was increasingly warranted . By week 's end there had been more than 1,000 incidents of violence . Trucks were hit by gunfire and damaged by brickbats and fire bombs ; some had their tires slashed or were set afire . Although Capps was the only fatality , more than 50 others were injured , several seriously . Trucker Howard Abrams , 45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Utah . A trucker in Michigan was wounded in the face by windshield glass when a shotgun blast hit his truck .

In La Porte , Ind. , a sniper fired at an 18-wheeler , missed , and hit Schoolteacher Chris Balawender , 35 , in the hip while he was driving a van loaded with eleven children . He managed to keep the vehicle under control , averting a major tragedy .

Some operators bypassed truck stops altogether , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm staying away from trouble , " said a Fogarty Van Lines driver near Joliet , Ill . <P> Some truckers took matters into their own hands . Robert Wells returned fire when one of three men in a car pumped six shots into his rig on I-55 near Crystal Springs , Miss . Three shots hit the driver 's door , but Wells escaped unharmed . Out of fear , as much as sympathy for the strike , some truckers held a serf-proclaimed moratorium on work . Said a Texas trucker at the Crossroads Truck Stop in Gary , Ind. : " A lot of guys have given up for a few days , gone home and parked their rigs in the driveway hoping this nasty stuff will blow over . " But for many , there was no choice . " Hell , I ca n't lay up , " said Trucker Wayne Renn of Lima , Ohio . " I got bills to pay . "
