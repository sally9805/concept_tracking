An alternative concept , plasma cosmology , drew physicists and astronomers to a meeting here last week to discuss recent observations that appear to contradict fundamental tenets of the Big Bang theory . Laboratory studies , computer simulations and astronomy ' s latest findings appear to buttress the heretical position. // Proponents of the newer theory believe that hot electrically charged gases known as plasma , the form in which nearly all observable cosmic matter exists , have played a critical but so far unappreciated role in shaping the universe - stars , galaxies and all . They contend that electric and magnetic forces of plasmas provided the framework and much of the power , along with gravity , to organize matter into galaxies and other large structures seen today . The universe of plasma cosmology has existed forever , without a beginning and with no end in sight. // The Big Bang , by contrast , assumes gravity is the dominant shaping force and rests squarely on Einstein ' s interpetation of gravity in his general theory of relativity . In this model , the universe began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 20 billion years ago and has been expanding steadily ever since . Depending on how much mass there is , it will continue to expand forever , dissipating into virtual nothingness , or eventually reverse itself and collapse in a " big crunch. " // Proponents of the alternative concept , mostly plasma scientists , concede that their numbers are small and their influence slight , especially compared with the titans of astrophysical theory who maintain a firm allegiance to the Big Bang . But their ideas are drawing the attention of some astronomers. // Plasma cosmology ' s earliest and most ardent advocate is Hannes Alfven , the Swedish physicist who won a Nobel Prize in 1970 for his work in founding the modern study of plasmas . The 81-year-old physicist is a professor emeritus at the University of California at San Diego and the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. // " The astrophysicists know they have problems with the Big Bang , and they ' re beginning to study our arguments , " Dr. Alfven said in an interview . " They ' re cautious , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a convert overnight. " // Dr. Alfven and other proponents held a three-day workshop here to report new evidence for plasma cosmology and to evaluate the implications of recent findings showing concentrations of galaxies apparently too vast to have formed in the time since the Big Bang and also measurements indicating that radiations supposedly left over from the initial explosion may be different than predicted by theory . The meeting was sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. // " Discoveries in space have drastically changed and expanded our concept of how cosmic plasma behaves , " said Carl-Gunne Falthammar , a physics professor at the Royal Institute of Technology. // With spacecraft and telescopes , scientists have observed huge electrical currents and magnetic fields in the solar system and beyond that resemble on a large scale what they had been seeing in laboratory plasma studies . One result of these forces , scientists reported , were the long filaments of matter that appear to be prevalent , a phenomenon that suggests how plasma processes led to large structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // In a direct challenge to Big Bang theorists , Anthony L. Peratt , a plasma physicist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico , who was one of the workshop organizers , said : " We ' re extrapolating from known phenomena . They ' re extrapolating from ad hoc assumptions. " // Astronomers reporting some of the observations that seemed to support the plasma cosmology , however , reserved judgment . " I ' m not convinced the Big Bang is out , " said Rainer Beck of the Max Planck Institute for Radioastronomy in Bonn , West Germany . " But I ' m open to new ideas. " // Leading Big Bang proponents deny that their concept is in serious trouble . They concede that magnetic forces are important in the universe and are including them in their new studies , but they say observations indicate that magnetism is not strong enough to be pushing matter around on a universe-building scale. // Jeremiah Ostriker , an astrophysicist at Princeton University , said : " I believe there really are missing ingredients to our understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have trouble understanding plasma as an alternative model . There ' s no observational evidence that I know of that indicates electric and magnetic forces are important on cosmological scales. " // The Big Bang was proposed in the 1930 ' s as a means of accounting for observations by Edwin Hubble in the previous decade that the universe is expanding , with galaxies hurtling out uniformly in all directions , as if from some explosive event . If gravity is the dominant force in shaping the cosmos and if the universe is homogeneous on the large scale , then Einstein ' s theory of relativity requires an expanding universe to have originated with an explosion at a single point. // But Dr. Alfven , cautioning against faulty reasoning , said : " If there were a Big Bang , you had to have the Hubble expansion . But it does not follow that because there ' s an expansion , there was a Big Bang . That ' s the same logic that says , all dogs are animals , and therefore all animals are dogs . " <> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved to be a successful theory . It explained many of the observations of astronomers and studies of atomic particles . What was regarded as decisive confirmation of the theory came in 1965 . Radio antennas detected microwave radiation of seemingly unvarying intensity pervading the cosmos , and this was widely accepted as the energy echo from the explosion. // Problems still taxed scientific ingenuity . Most of the mass required for such a universe is missing , an estimated 90 percent of it beyond present observation ; so astrophysicists have invoked something called dark matter , hypothetical exotic particles and perhaps larger unseen objects , to account for the mass . Galaxies appeared to have evolved too early and developed into clusters too large ; here , too , the dark matter might have supplied the necessary gravity , or perhaps " cosmic strings , " streams of exotic particles generated in the moment of creation , could have acted as the framework for the universe ' s early clumping into galaxies. // Three years ago , R. Brent Tully , an astronomer at the University of Hawaii , found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " supercluster complex " about one billion light-years long . If the observations are correct - they are still being debated - astrophysicists conceded that even dark-matter theories could not account for such large structure in the universe . There would not have been sufficient gravity or time. // Then , more than a year ago , Japanese and American scientists reported infrared observations showing that the background radiation , the presumed relic of the Big Bang , had more energy than predicted by the theory . This has yet to be explained , and attempts to confirm the measurements will be made with rocket launchings this summer. // As the problems have mounted , a few scientists began to explore Dr. Alfven ' s idea of a plasma cosmology and became convinced that there was more than gravity in the evolution of cosmic structure . Since 99 percent of the observed universe is composed of matter in plasma form , they argued , the influence of plasma ' s powerful electrical and magnetic properties should not be ignored. // Plasma is sometimes called the " fourth state of matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a plasma most closely resembles the latter , except that the atoms and molecules comprising plasma are so energetic that some of them have lost one or more electrons . This makes them electically charged . Plasmas are more efficient conductors of electricity than copper. // The Sun is a gravitationally bound plasma , and the particles streaming out from the Sun as the " solar wind " are a plasma . Spacecraft have discovered a torus of plasma around Jupiter and Saturn. // According to Eric J. Lerner , an independent plasma researcher in Lawrenceville , N.J. , the most important aspect of plasma for cosmology is its tendency to become clumpy. // In laboratory experiments , small random motions in electric currents of plasma , caused by the magnetic fields they create , draw them close together in a " pinch effect . " The merging currents produce larger currents and magnetic fields and rapidly lead to a network of ever-larger filaments . Once they get big enough , their gravitational fields will exert a major force. // Computer simulations by Dr. Peratt show that galaxies could form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a string . The simulations also show that the spiral shape of many galaxies may result from the effects of these plasma currents and their associated magnetism. // Plasma scientists cite a discovery made in 1984 as crucial evidence that what they see in the laboratory and in simulations is actually occurring in nature . Radioastronomers from Columbia University found real filaments near the center of the Milky Way , the Earth ' s galaxy . Mr. Lerner said they look like " textbook examples of electromagnetic vortices. " // Mark Morris , an astronomer at the University of California at Los Angeles , reported at the workshop that recent observations of these filaments reveal behavior suggesting that powerful magnetic fields , not gravity , could be the dominant force at the center of the Milky Way . If this is correct , and turns out to be the case elsewhere , Dr. Morris said , the strange objects at the center of galaxies may not be black holes , which are believed to be tremendous gravitational wells sucking in everything , but magnetic fields. // But it would take an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields to create the large structures , clusters of galaxies joining in superclusters , that appear to be common to cosmic architecture. // " If you have a universe that doesn ' t have a Big Bang , you have plenty of time , " Mr. Lerner said . <> <> <> <> Another Recipe for a Galaxy <> <> Electric current in a charged gas or plasma creates a magnetic field , which in turn bends the current .

When they merge ( 4 ) , gravity is sufficient to attract matter into clumps that evolve into stars that eventually cluster in a classical spiral galaxy like NGC1300 . <> Source : Anthony L.
