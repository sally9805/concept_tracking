ADVENTURES OF THE MIND Can We Know The Universe ? By CARL SAGAN cience is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge . Its goal is to find out how the world works , to seek what regularities there may be , to penetrate to the connections of things  --  from subnuclear particles , which may be the constituents of all matter , to living organisms , the human social community and thence to the cosmos as a whole . Our intuition is by no means an infallible guide . Our perceptions may be distorted by training and prejudice or merely because of the limitations of our sense organs , which , of course , perceive directly but a small fraction of the phenomena of the world . Even so straightforward a question as whether in the absence of friction a pound of lead falls faster than a gram of fluff was answered incorrectly by Aristotle and almost everyone else before the time of Galileo . Science is based on experiment , on a willingness to challenge old dogma , on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accordingly , science sometimes requires courage  --  at the very least the courage to question the conventional wisdom . Beyond this , the main trick of science is to really think of something : the shape of clouds and their occasional sharp bottom edges at the same altitude everywhere in the sky ; the formation of a dewdrop on a leaf ; the origin of a name or a word  --  Shakespeare , say , or " philanthropic " ; the reason for human social customs  --  the incest taboo , for example ; how it is that a lens in sunlight can make paper burn ; how a " walking stick " got to look so much like a twig ; why the Moon seems to follow us as we walk ; what prevents us from digging a hole down to the center of the Earth ; what the definition is of " down " on a spherical Earth ; how it is possible for the body to convert yesterday 's lunch into today 's muscle and sinew ; or how far is up  --  does the universe go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any meaning to the question of what lies on the other side ? Some of these questions are pretty easy . Others , especially the last , are mysteries to which no one even today knows the answer . They are natural questions to ask . Every culture has posed such questions in one way or another . Almost always the proposed answers are in the nature of " Just So Stories " ? attempted explanations divorced from experiment or even from careful comparative observations . But the scientific cast of mind examines the world critically as if many alternative worlds might exist , as if other things might be here which are not . Then we are forced to ask why what we see is present and not something else . Why are the Sun and the Moon and the planets spheres ? Why not pyramids , or cubes , or dodecahedra ? Why not irregular , jumbly shapes ? Why so symmetrical , worlds ? If you spend any time spinning hypotheses , checking to see whether they make sense , whether they conform to what else we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deflate your hypotheses , you will find yourself doing science . And as you come to practice this habit of thought more and more , you will get better and better at it . To penetrate into the heart of the thing  --  even a little thing , a blade of grass , as Walt Whitman said  --  is to experience a kind of exhilaration that , it may be , only human beings of all the beings on this planet can feel . We are an intelligent species and the use of our intelligence quite properly gives us pleasure . In this respect the brain is like a muscle . When we think well , we feel good . Understanding is a kind of ecstasy . But to what extent can we really know the universe around us ? Sometimes this question is posed by people who hope the answer will be in the negative , who are fearful of a universe in which everything might one day be known . And sometimes we hear pronouncements from scientists who confidently state that everything worth knowing will soon be known  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Dionysian or Polynesian age in which the zest for intellectual discovery has withered , to be replaced by a kind of subdued languor , the lotus eaters drinking fermented coconut milk or some other mild hallucinogen . In addition to maligning both the Polynesians , who were intrepid explorers ( and whose brief respite in paradise is now sadly ending ) , as well as the inducements to intellectual discovery provided by some hallucinogens , this contention turns out to be trivially mistaken . Let us approach a much more modest question : not whether we can know the universe or the Milky Way Galaxy or a star or a world . Can we know , ultimately and in detail , a grain of salt ? Consider one microgram of table salt , a speck just barely large enough for someone with keen eyesight to make out without a microscope . In that grain of salt there are about 1016 sodium and chlorine atoms . This is a 1 followed by 16 zeros , 10 million billion atoms . If we wish to know a grain of salt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these atoms . ( In fact , there is much more to be known  --  for example , the nature of the forces between the atoms  --  but we are making only a modest calculation . ) Now , is this number more or less than the number of things which the brain can know ? How much can the brain know ? There are perhaps 10 " , one hundred trillion . But this number is only one percent of the number of atoms in our speck of salt . So , in this sense , the universe is intractable , astonishingly immune to any human attempt at full knowledge . We can not on this level understand a grain of salt , much less the universe . But let us look a little more deeply at our microgram of salt . Salt happens to be a crystal in which , except for defects in the structure of the crystal lattice , the position of every sodium and chlorine atom is predetermined . If we could shrink ourselves into this crystalline world , we would see rank upon rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure  --  sodium , chlorine , sodium , chlorine , specifying the sheet of atoms weare standing on and all the sheets above us and below us . An absolutely pure crystal of salt could have the position of every atom specified by something like 10 bits of information . This would not strain the information-carrying capacity of the brain . If the universe had natural laws that governed its behavior to the same degree of regularity that determines a crystal of salt , then , of course , the universe would be knowable . Even if there were many such laws , each of considerable complexity , human beings might have the capability to understand them all . Even if such knowledge exceeded the information-carrying capacity of the brain , we might store the additional information outside our bodies  --  in books , for example , or in computer memories  --  and still , in some sense , know the universe . Human beings are , understandably , highly motivated to find regularities , natural laws . The search for rules , the only possible way to understand such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe forces those who live in it to understand it . Those creatures who find everyday experience a muddled jumble of events with no predictability , no regularity , are in grave peril . The universe belongs to those who , at least to some degree , have figured it out . It is an astonishing fact that there are laws of nature , rules that summarize conveniently  --  not just qualitatively but quantitatively  --  how the world works . We might imagine a universe in which there are no such laws , in which the 10 " elementary particles that make up a universe like our own behave with utter and uncompromising abandon . To understand such a universe , we would need a brain at least as massive as the universe . It seems unlikely that such a universe could have life and intelligence , because beings and brains require some degree of internal stability and order . But even if in a much more random universe there were such beings with an intelligence much greater than our own , there could not be much knowledge , passion or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe that has at least important parts that are knowable . Our common-sense experience and our evolutionary history have prepared us to understand something of the workaday world . When we go into other realms , however , common sense and ordinary intuition turn out to be highly unreliable guides . It is stunning that as we go close to the speed of light our mass increases indefinitely , we shrink toward zero thickness in the direction of motion , and time for us comes as near to stopping as we would like . Many people think that this is silly , and every week or two I get a letter from someone who complains to me about it . But it is a virtually certain consequence not just of experiment but also of Albert Einstein 's brilliant analysis of space and time called the Special Theory of Relativity . It does not matter that these effects seem unreasonable to us . We are not in the habit of traveling close to the speed of light . The testimony of our common sense is suspect at high velocities . Or consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dumbbell  --  a molecule of salt , it might be . Such a molecule rotates about an axis through the line connecting the two atoms . But in the world of quantum mechanics , the realm of the very small , not all orientations of our dumbbell molecule are possible . It might be that the molecule could be oriented in a horizontal position , say , or in a vertical position , but not at many angles in between . Some rotational positions are forbidden . Forbidden by what ? By the laws of nature . The universe is built in such a way as to limit , or quantize , rotation . We do not experience this directly in everyday life ; we would find it startling as well as awkward in sitting-up exercises , to find arms outstretched from the sides or pointed up to the skies permitted but many intermediate positions forbidden . We do not live in the world of the small , on the scale of 1013 centimeters , in the realm where there are 12 zeros between the decimal place and the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count is experiment  --  in this case , observations from the far infrared spectra of molecules . They show molecular rotation to be quantized . The idea that the world places restrictions on what humans might do is frustrating . Why indeed should n't we be able to have intermediate rotational positions ? Why ca n't we travel faster than the speed of light ? This is the way the universe is constructed . Such prohibitions not only press us toward a little humility ; they also make the world more knowable . Every restriction corresponds to a law of nature , a regularization of the universe . The more restrictions there are on what matter and energy can do , the more knowledge human beings can attain . Whether in some sense the universe is ultimately knowable depends not only on how many natural laws there are that encompass widely divergent phenomena , but also on whether we have the openness and the intellectual capacity to understand such laws . Our formulations of the regularities of nature are surely dependent on how the brain is built , but also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is built . I like a universe that includes much that is unknown and , at the same time , much that is knowable . A universe in which everything is known would be static and dull . A universe that is unknowable is no fit place for a thinking being . The ideal universe for us is one very much like the universe we inhabit . And I would guess that this is not really much of a coincidence .
