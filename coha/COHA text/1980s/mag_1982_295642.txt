Famous as the site where King Charles Martel beat back Muslim hordes in 732 , the sleepy French city of Poitiers is again a war zone . This time the defenders are French customs agents trying to hold back an invasion of Japanese video recorders . This year alone , 550,000 ( 85% of total sales ) were sold , an influx authorities fear could cripple France 's own fledgling video recorder industry and deepen its projected $14 billion foreign trade deficit . When hefty new $65 annual licensing fees failed to dent demand , the government turned to obstructionism . Henceforth , decreed the French government , every Japanese recorder would have to clear a tiny ten-man customhouse in landlocked Poitiers . <P> The order had its intended effect : more than 60,000 video recorders are now backed up awaiting languorous inspection , and only 16,000 of the 200,000 recorders ordered for the holiday season are expected to make it to store shelves in time . So far Tokyo has expressed only " regret , " but the gambit may well boomerang in classic protectionist fashion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from France will surely keep the Poitiers ploy in mind .
