And so the city has spoken to and inspired architects through all ages. // Louis Sullivan , credited with the invention of the skyscraper , was already smitten with the city ' s buildings when an elegant passerby on its streets moved him still more . He wished ' ' to know who and what kind of man was behind the dignity , ' ' he wrote later. // ' ' Who was the high-hatted figure stepping into a carriage ? ' ' he asked a worker on the site. // ' ' Why he ' s the architect of this building , ' ' a workman said . And a star was born. // Convention has it that architects are made otherwise - by their passion for erector sets , their Lincoln-log adolescence , their tinker-toy childhood . Such are the blocks that build our builders , legend claims. // Historians say playing with the Froebel block helped make Frank Lloyd Wright ; feminists worry that no play with blocks - building-block deprivation - has denied their daughters access to the field. // If that is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toy , may have inspired a new generation to take their talents for meshing interlocking parts into a modern design a step further. // Now in their fifth year , the so-called road shows of the Danish design company may be the most omnipresent architecture show in the country , taking a wide variety of forms - from Washington ' s Capitol to the Eiffel Tower . Now in Dayton ' s department store in Minneapolis and the Hallmark mall in St. Louis , the exhibition awes onlookers with its capacity for building architectural mountains out of Lego molehills. // The Road Show No. 5 , witnessed recently , has its delights . The chest-high US Capitol - stairs swelling from the floor of the department store exhibit area , the details executed in tiny plastic parts - is in the Guinness Book of World Records mode . Visitors are invited to compete in counting the number of Legos employed ; youngsters sit at tables and try their hand at copying the models , or creating their own. // Director Bill Higgins of the Lego Company credits the blocks ( ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new generation of architects . His own model builder , Dave Scerundolo , grew up with Legos , and Higgins has great visions of Lego stackers growing up to create sky-high buildings. // ' ' There isn ' t a place that the sun sets that a kid isn ' t playing with Lego , ' ' Higgins says. // The road to a profession is not a straight path , however , and the start of the school year should suggest that there is more than one route to learning design. // Whether the architectural role model - perhaps Daddy Brady in The Brady Bunch - or Vance Packard , placing the architectural profession in high esteem , will inspire the next generation of architects is unknown , but many architects now living arrived at their calling in circular fashion , indeed. // For instance , Denise Scott-Brown of the firm of Venturi , Rauch &; Scott-Brown , simply thought that architecture was ' ' women ' s work . ' ' Her mother studied the subject and practiced in Zimbabwe . The young Denise followed her role - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attending architecture school , where she discovered , to her great surprise , that her classmates were mostly men. // Her husband , Robert Venturi , growing up in America , the son of Italian parents , thought architecture was a field of everyday cultural concern , like the proverbial opera , she says. // His fruit-merchant father had a splendid design for his store in the ' 20s - and books ' ' with beautiful pictures of Italian architecture ' ' filled their home , she says. // A reverence for a profession sometimes determines the final choice . Frances Steloff , the famous bookseller , who figured in a recent book charting professional passions ( ' ' Particular Passions ' ' ) , wrote of a father who ' ' if he ever dropped one of his books on the floor , he picked it up and kissed it. ' ' // Unfortunately for architecture , buildings are not objects of that kind of reverence . Many designers came to architecture by default . Bill Grover of Moore Grover Harper wanted to be an inventor , trained for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Kevin Roche , who won this year ' s prestigious Pritzger Prize , came to architecture by an even greater default : ' ' I was an absolutely hopeless student , ' ' he says . ' ' ( Architecture ) was one of the few things I could do . ' ' Though Roche ' s parents thought architecture was a ' ' mildly indecent thing ' ' for a boy growing up in a small Irish town to do , Roche may have had a subliminal visual education in the handsome , formal town planning of his native Mitchelstown , he says. // Similarly , critics have suggested that Frank Lloyd Wright ' s changing visual surroundings during his roaming youth were - along with the blocks - a source of his sense for altering the built environment. // Paul Rudolph , the son of a minister , has cited his peripatetic youth , moving from parish to parish , plus his mother ' s touch with flowers on the table , as the origin of his architectural strivings. // Proximity to great architecture or architects like Wright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otto Wagner claimed that the day his successful architect grandfather took him for a ride in a splendid carriage his career started : // ' ' Impressed by such opulence , the boy decided there and then to enter this lucrative profession , ' ' Richard J. Neutra , the famous modernist , observed. // Richard Haas , whose murals that mimic buildings have become as prevalent as many types of buildings , came by his architecture through the same kind of aura . Growing up a mile south of Frank Lloyd Wright ' s home , Taliesin , in Spring Green , Wis . , Midwesterner Haas had a sense of a glamorous mystique . He remembered well when Wright ' ' in his flat hat , can , and cape stepped out of a rust-colored Lincoln Continental with an oval rear window ; the other members of the Taliesin Fellowship parked miniature Austins of the same color nearby . ' ' Their world of mystery wafted toward him. // And in the end , that mystery , more than any building blocks , may account for the coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
