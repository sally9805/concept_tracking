Before the chill in U.S.-Soviet relations , poetry rather than politics was the symbol of the Soviet Union 's break with Stalinism , and at lecture halls across America in the 1960s and ' 70s , Yevgeni Yevtushenko and Andrei Voznesensky were Russian poetry 's most distinguished ambassadors . This month Yevtushenko , 51 , and Voznesensky , 52 , are in the U.S. on an unofficial but widely praised visit . Voznesensky , his country 's greatest living poet , took the opportunity to accept belatedly a 1984 honorary degree from Oberlin College , where he inveighed against " barbarians of every age , " and intoned : " For an artist trueborn/ revolt is second nature : / he is both tribune/ and troublemaker . " Meanwhile , Yevtushenko has been traveling across the country performing an environmentalist " Concert for the Earth " with American Jazzman Paul Winter . Last week both men of Soviet letters were in New York City for a special reading and concert at Carnegie Hall that expressed their shared hopes for peace . Says Yevtushenko : " The trouble with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see people 's faces . As for me , I am going home with a whole sackful of American faces . "
