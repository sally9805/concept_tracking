A few rate A 's , but others are middling C 's at best <P> Despite Ronald Reagan 's intention to establish a true cabinet government , as he did when he was Governor of California , the need for central coordination of policy inevitably drew power from federal departments to the White House . Nevertheless , Reagan has tried to foster a sense of team play . In addition to attending frequent Cabinet meetings , most of the Secretaries belong to one or more of five " Cabinet councils " set up to coordinate issues that fall into broad areas . For example , the Secretary of Health and Human Services chairs a council on " human resources , " whose members include the Attorney General and the Secretaries of Agriculture , Labor , Education and Housing and Urban Development . <P> Some of the Secretaries have put their individual stamps on policy matters . Others have evidently failed to master the intricacies of their jobs . There are 17 members of the Cabinet , four of whom are , in a sense , ministers without portfolio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Trade Representative Bill Brock and CIA Director William Casey . The following assessment of the men who have departmental responsibilities , listed in order of protocol , is based on the reporting of correspondents in TIME 's Washington bureau . <P> Prickly Vicar <P> In his four-star drive to become what he called " the vicar of American foreign policy , " Secretary of State Alexander Haig has endured a dizzying eleven-month roller-coaster ride . Yet after all his ups and downs , Haig , 57 , seems to have achieved what he wanted . Foreign policy is now coordinated not by the emasculated National Security Council but by interagency groups chaired by the State Department . <P> Haig 's aggressive style is alien to the laid-back Californians at the White House , who feel that the Secretary 's well-publicized turf battles with colleagues were as avoidable as they were embarrassing . The volatile former NATO commander still has a tendency to erupt at slights , but he appears more secure than he did a few months ago , possibly because he enjoys more frequent access to the President . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy than at conceptualizing the broader outlines of American goals ; neither he nor his close aides are known as idea men . His comments often seem contradictory , and on such subjects as Soviet-sponsored terrorism his rhetoric has been excessive . Nonetheless , Haig has brought a realistic approach to the management of policy , often restraining the hard-line ideologues at the Pentagon . For example , he was able to overcome Defense Department objections to resuming talks with the Soviets on reducing nuclear weapons in Europe . ( Once the talks were approved , however , the specific proposals were essentially devised by Pentagon planners. )
