 | The roller-coaster life ? and career ? of one of TV 's most popular actresses . By Bob Thomas , with captions by Angela Lansbury E very weekday morning a polished limousine glides through the silent streets of Brentwood , a suburb west of Los Angeles . At precisely 6:00 A.M. the car stops before a white stucco wall in front of a handsome but unpretentious house . Seconds later Angela Lansbury , clad in slacks and a blouse and carrying a script under her arm , strides briskly through the front gate . With a cheery " Hello ! " to her driver she enters the limo to make the trip to Universal Studios . It may  | well be 8:00 at night ? or later ? before the same car returns her to her home . This is the daily routine that Angela must follow as the star of the hit CBSTV series , Murder , She Wrote . It is a regimen that could exhaust a person half her 61 years . But it has brought joy to Angela in many ways ? not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role model for mature women . During the show 's first season , Angela , as Jessica Fletcher , dressed just a cut above frumpy . Now her character has acquired a more Angela-like smartness , especially when she visits big cities . After all , Angela reasons , Jessica is a successful woman , and she should dress the part . " I think Jessica has become a bit more real , closer to me than when we started out , " she said . In one major respect Jessica and Angela are identical : They are survivors . Jessica endures endless perils every Sunday night . Angela has overcome a host of trials : the early death of her father , an unhappy first marriage , repeated career disappointments . During one horrendous period , her mother , actress Moyna MacGill , had incurable throat cancer , her children were on drugs , and her house burned to the ground . But Angela survived ... . She comes from a strong family , achievers in the worlds of business , politics , and the theater . Angela Brigid Lansbury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where her father owned a factory and her mother was a well-known stage actress , Moyna MacGill . Angela 's grandfather , George Lansbury , was the fiery leader of the Labour Party , and his oratory greatly influenced her later career . He was always a great figure of charisma and personality , " she said . " Such an extraordinary politician in Britain that you knew you were with an entity that was bigger than life . " Angela remembers hearing him spellbind huge audiences and being impressed " with the power of the spoken word on the masses . " She was also impressed by backstage visits to her mother . Moyna retired after the birth of twin sons ? Edgar and Bruce ? when Angela was five . ( Moyna also had a daughter , Isolda , by a previous marriage to actor-producer Reginald Denham . ) An acting career seemed remote to the young Angela . " I was terribly shy , absolutely incapable of coming out of my shell . It took me years to get over that , " she said . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lansburys suffered . Edgar Lansbury 's factory went bankrupt . " But my mother had done a marvelous thing , " said Angela . " Unbeknownst to my father , she had put away money that she had earned in a couple of very successful shows . She bailed out the family . " In 1935 , however , when Angela was only nine , Edgar Lansbury died . " I was very devoted to him , " she recalled . " When he died , I was shattered . As a child you recover quickly . But as years went by , I realized there was a tremendous void in my life . " Between the ages of 10 and 15 , I really emerged from being a terribly ? rather annoyingly ? emotional child to being a far more self-reliant individual . I had to be because I became almost a surrogate husband to my mother . She relied on me tremendously . My sister , Isolda , by that time was out of the nest , embarking on her own theatrical career . " ( Isolda later became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatened with German bombings in World War II , Moyna MacGill sought to evacuate her young family to America . After struggling through bureaucratic red tape , she sent a plea to First Lady Eleanor Roo-  | sevelt , who had shared platforms with George Lansbury during a peace campaign across America . The connection may have helped because in August of 1940 , a month before the bombing of Britain started , Moyna , Angela , and the twins boarded the Canadian Pacific liner Duchess of Atholl and set forth in a convoy to New York . Two sponsoring families helped the Lansburys get settled in America . As soon as they acquired work permits , both Moyna and Angela began performing . And when she was just 16 , Angela went to Montreal to do a nightclub act for $60 a week . " The only thing I 've ever had confidence in is my ability to perform , " she said . That is the one area ? touch wood ? where I have never had any doubt that I could deliver the goods . That has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that has absolutely seen me through thick and thin , and even saved my sanity on a number of occasions . " Moyna went to Hollywood to act in a little theater run by London friends . Angela joined her and became the ticket-taker at the theater . To earn some more money , mother and daughter wrapped packages and sold clothing at Bull-ock 's department store on Wilshire Boulevard . " I had a promising career there , " said Angela , but my math was so bad that I could n't figure up the prices . I left school when I was 12 , so my formal education was absolutely minuscule . But my worldly education has been large . " Her entry into films happened with dizzying speed . An actor friend said he was testing at MGM for The Picture of Dorian Gray and suggested she would be ideal for a role in it . He arranged an audition , and the casting agent said , " You came at the right time . We 're desperately looking for someone to play the maid in Gaslight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewing the test , Louis B. Mayer decreed : " Sign that girl ! " Angela was given a seven-year MGM contract at $500 a week . Within a year , she had appeared in National Velvet , Gaslight , and The Picture of Dorian Gray , winning Academy nominations as supporting actress for the latter two . However , MGM could never quite fit the talented English girl into its glamour factory . She was cast as a much older villainess in The Harvey Girls , as Walter Pidgeon 's spiteful 35-year-old wife in If Winter Comes , and as a fortyish publisher who tries to seduce Spencer Tracy in State of the Union . " I never felt that I was glamorous , " Angela admitted was English , and I think that prevented me from getting into the social life . I was very shy , very trepidatious of moving into the stream of Hollywood social life . " I never have to this day . I do n't really know how to play that scene . If you write it for me , I can play it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it , you have to work at it , and I felt my responsibility was to the work : the acting , the doing better , the growing . " In 1945 Angela married actor Richard Cromwell , the hero of several 1930s films . The marriage lasted nine months . " It was a shattering experience , " Angela recalled . " It was my first crush , and I never should have gotten into it . " Then , to 1947 , Hurd Hatfield , Angela 's co-star in Dorian Gray , invited her to a weekend party at a friend 's house in Ojai . The man who drove her there was a fellow MGM contract player , Peter Shaw , a hand-some , sturdy Englishman . " We were so pleased to meet fellow countrymen , " she said . " that we became incredible friends very quickly . Out of the weekend and subsequent dates , we decided we would make our lives together . " In 1949 Angela and Peter returned to England , intending to marry in her family church . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been divorced . The couple married instead in the Scottish Presbyterian Church .  | Back in Hollywood the newlyweds realized their days at MGM were numbered . The studio still had no notion of how best to use Angela 's talents , and both Angela and Peter had by now concluded that he was n't cut out to be an actor . " He had this lovely personality , but he did n't trust it , " Angela explained . " He did n't know how to use it , as Cary Grant did . Cary started out as Archie Leach and eventually became a very good actor . " Instead Peter became a top agent at the William Morris Agency , as well as a studio executive . And in later years he has managed his wife 's career . In 1952 Angela and Peter 's son Anthony was born , followed a year and a half later by the birth of a daughter , Deirdre . Peter also had a son , David , by his first marriage . But careerwise , the 1950s were a lean period for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramas and played small but important roles in such films as The Long Hot Summer , The Dark at the Top of the Stairs , and The Manchurian Candidate ( for which she got her third Oscar nomination ) . She also made her Broadway debut opposite Bert Lahr in Hotel Paradiso , which lasted for only 107 performances . Another show , Anyone Can Whistle , folded after only nine performances in 1964 , but it proved a golden opportunity for Angela . The show 's composer , Jerry Herman , admired her singing and dancing and sought her for the musical Maine . Angela opened in Maine on May 24 , 1966 , and conquered Manhattan . But her long-awaited career triumph , which included a Tony award , played counterpoint to the problems in Angela 's personal life at this time . " The latter 1960s was a difficult period for everybody , " Angela observed . " The whole country was going through a period of doubt about itself . There was a terrible drug problem for all youngsters . " Her son , Anthony , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heroin at 17 . Deirdre also became involved with the drug scene . ( Before this interview Angela requested not to be asked about her children 's drug abuse . She feels they have conquered their problems , and she does n't want to cause them further stress . But in an earlier interview , she remarked : " Both my children , particularly my son , became involved with drugs . Malibu , where we lived in the 1960s , was a hotbed of youthful drug abuse . To those kids , it was as common as bubble gum . " ) There was further tragedy . Peter underwent major hip surgery , and Angela 's mother developed throat cancer and her vocal cords were removed ? " The worst possible thing that could happen to an actress , " Angela believes . The ultimate blow came one blistering day in 1970 when the area around Los Angeles was threatened by fire . Angela recalled : " I was driving back home to Malibu with my mother after a lunch at Paramount with my brother Bruce both of Angela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could smell burning brush , and could see clouds of smoke . When we reached the Malibu traffic light , a policeman would n't let me through . " I was frantic ! I did n't know whether the house had burned down . I drove down the old Malibu road , left Mother in the car , and climbed the bank to our house . Inside , the only sounds of life were the cat and the humming of the clothes dryer . I found a note from the maid saying she had to go . " Angela frantically gathered up the cat and some of her mother 's things . Anthony , then Peter arrived to help . The house seemed in no danger . But then the wind changed ? and Angela and Peter had to watch helplessly as their house and everything in it was totally destroyed . " That kind of loss is so shattering that you ca n't really deal with it immediately , " said Angela . " You ca n't rant and rail and weep and carry on . You 're absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a branch , a big , luscious branch of your life , and sealing it off with a sealer so it does n't bleed . That 's what you do . That 's how the human mind deals with these tragedies . Afterward , you have to pick up the pieces and go on . " The Shaws were overwhelmed by the thoughtfulness of friends who offered gifts and supplies and , most valuable , photographs . All their treasured family photos ? pictures of the children , including 8mm home movies ? had- gone up in flames . The family moved into a rented house in Malibu , but Angela realized something dramatic was needed to break the spate of bad fortune that had been plaguing them . Her solution : moving to Ireland . " Something was telling me that I should give Malibu a miss for a while , " she said . " There was nothing holding us there . We did n't own a piece of ground or a stick of furniture . We did n't even own a car . " One of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 1 and went to Ireland alone with my sister . I had such a wonderful time that my whole life from then on was devoted to getting back to Ireland . That was my Shangri-la . " In 1969 after appearing in a show , Dear World , that flopped on Broadway , Angela had healed her wounds by motoring alone through Ireland for 10 days . On her return , she 'd told Peter . " We must take the children there some day . "  | Someday had arrived . Angela borrowed an Irish sweater , packed a small suitcase , and flew to Ireland , determined to find a new home for her family . What she found was an 1825 vicar 's house on 20 acres in County Cork . Angela amazed herself by remodeling the house herself , ordering the removal of walls , and modernizing the kitchen . Deirdre apprenticed as a cook in a nearby guest house , ideal training , as it turned out , for her future career . Anthony also cooked and waited tables at a pub , meanwhile discovering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of commuting from California , left his MGM job to join them . Moyna MacGill lost her long battle with cancer . But the Shaws kept the County Cork house until 1980 , using it as a refuge from the pressures of Angela 's career . Her roller-coaster course included a triumphant revival of Gypsy in London and New York , playing the pie-making lady friend of the murderous Sweeney Todd , and such movies as The Mirror Crack 'd and Death on the Nile . In 1984 Angela astounded her agents by announcing that she was ready to re-enter television . She appeared in Little Gloria . . . Happy at Last , then agreed to undertake a series . After rejecting the first two offers presented to her , she then had to choose between a Norman Lear sitcom or the role of writer-sleuth Jessica Fletcher in Murder , She Wrote . Angela chose Murder , and the rest is history . Today the Shaws live in a gleaming white house that Angela describes as a combination of Mediterranean and farmhouse , with a touch of California ranch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spacious bathroom with its eightfoot spa tub , the cozy bedroom with king-size bed , a small office , a guest bedroom , where her brother Bruce was staying at the time , a television room she had designed , a wide-open kitchen leading to a den overlooking the darkblue swimming pool . Not a luxury house by Hollywood standards , but a place where Angela and Peter can cook their own dinners ? they prefer to be alone at night ? and replenish their energies after the daily grind . " We brought all of our furniture from Ireland , " Angela said , " and it , works ! " She proudly displayed her garden , growing on three terraces leading down the canyon behind the house in rows of vegetables , shade plants , and flowers . And she enumerated her favorites : delphiniums , foxgloves , columbines , English lavender . Angela also finds time to devote to her major cause ? combating violence against women and children . To this end she serves on the board of the Family Rescue Center of Chicago . And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 33 , is now a production assistant on Murder , She Wrote , and is scheduled to direct an episode for the first time this season . He is married and father of the two Shaw grandchildren , Peter , 3 ' /- , and Katherine , 1 . Deirdre , 32 , operates a restaurant in Rome with her Italian husband , and Angela and Peter visit there every summer . David , 41 and divorced , is a suc- cessful builder . Home . Family . Work . Those are the themes that thread through Angela Lansbury 's life , often to the neglect , she admits , of other things . " Neither Peter nor I have ever known how to just play , " she said . " We 've always had our noses to the grindstone . " Home is my counterweight to work , and it 's important to me to have the home to keep the balance . I do know how to play at home and I 'd rather do that than go to some strange place and kick up my heels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , long marriages such as Peter 's and mine , you need to concentrate on each other and on the family . That 's how we 've made it work . "
