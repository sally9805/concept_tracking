I am here to defend the color blue . A lot has been said and written about the color in this past week in this city and not much of it has been favorable . I am here to give blue a good rubdown and a slap on the seat of the pants and send it back into the game . Blue is my favorite color . I have blue eyes . Much of my body color for most of this winter has been a frozen blue . The sky is blue . The ocean is blue . I find no greater pleasure than standing in the shower and singing the song , " Blue Moon , " dip-de-dip , as loud as I can . I like Vida Blue . I liked " Blue Lagoon , " even though most of the critics didn ' t . I ' m even partial to Julius Erving because his wife ' s name is Turquoise . Am I to disregard the feelings of a lifetime to join a lynch mob ? I ' d be feeling mighty blue if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dallas Cowboys and the Philadelphia Eagles , the participants in this afternoon ' s publicized joust for the championship of the National Football Conference and a trip to the Super Bowl at New Orleans in two weeks . These two teams are treating the color blue as if it were a plague , a curse , a re-incarnation of smallpox . The Cowboys , whose uniform colors are blue and silver and white , seem to have had problems while wearing their blue shirts . In the past five years they have worn the shirts 20 times and have won only 10 of those games . Since the Cowboys ' overall record is 58-18 in that time - 48-8 in their white shirts - they seem to have been spooked by those blue shirts . They won only one , lost three in their four appearances in blue in this 14-4 season . They have grown to hate blue , to fight against the unwritten National Football League rule that visiting teams wear dark colors and home teams wear white , to connive and squirm and ask and plead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eagles have forced the Cowboys to wear blue today . " It ' s our choice , " the Eagles have said . " Our choice is that you wear blue . " I have followed the horselaughs in the Philadelphia papers , the Eagles sounding as if they already have put a touchdown on the scoreboard and will be punching in another one from the one-foot line as soon as the game begins . I also have followed Dallas coach Tom Landry ' s expression of bruised feelings . He paints the Eagles as childish , petty , silly as a schoolgirl being tickled with a feather . A defensive tackle for the Cowboys has gone so far as to say " that ' s all right , I don ' t care if we have to wear pink . " I am shocked by all of it . Pink ? This is blue we ' re talking about here . Royal blue . Dark blue . Regal blue . Red , white and . . . that ' s right . . . blue . This is the color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness . How can the Eagles think they have found some blueprint for success by invoking this blue law ? How can the Cowboys be singing the blues ? I say blue is a part of this game , the best part . Black and blue . I take my blue chippers and you take your bluebloods and we go out on a nice little stretch ofKentucky blue grass and whale the bejeebers out of each other . That ' s football . Don ' t step on my blue suede shoes . One of us wins . One of us loses . My Blue Heaven . Or Blue Monday . Nothing in-between . I want a bunch of blue-collar guys on my playoff team , guys who ' ll work forever . I want tough guys , guys who look like Bluebeard . He was a pirate . I want guys who are aggressive , who ' ll talk a blue streak all day long . ( Whatever did happen to Thomas Henderson , anyway ? ) I want big old farmers in blue jeans who work to a happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . He ' s working with his jig-saw on his fold- out table . ) I want blue ribbon guys with a high blue book value . Be worried about wearing blue ? Try to force another team to wear blue ? Ridiculous . I say the Cowboys are wrong for trying to stay away from wearing bluebecause they are neglecting one fact in their history . The last time they won a trip to the Super Bowl was in 1979 when they beat the Los Angeles Rams , 28-0 . They did it wearing blue . You can look it up . I say the Eagles are wrong for worrying about the issue because they have bigger issues to worry about today . They have to stop that long-ball Dallas offense that has looked better and better in the past two playoff games under its young quarterback . The Dallas defense had better be stopped , too , that passrush up the middle , those big Cowboys linemen pounding in search of Ron Jaworski . Blue ? I don ' t think a simple color , blue , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eagles should concern themselves with white . Danny White . And Randy White .
