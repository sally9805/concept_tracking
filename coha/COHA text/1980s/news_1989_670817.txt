That is not because of the hard questions the Texas oilman and takeover artist is expected to ask the company ' s management . It is , instead , because there is a possibility of a scene unique to the Japanese corporate world : the appearance of " sokaiya , " thugs who specialize in disrupting annual meetings. // Koito and the Tokyo police expect the sokaiya to divide into two groups , some backing management , others siding with Mr. Pickens . A staged fight might break out , and police might rush in . The voluble Mr. Pickens could be drowned out and Koito could be deeply embarrassed. // // Chaos and Conspiracy Theories // Whether this scene comes to pass is anyone ' s guess . But many people in the upper echelons of Japanese business are openly predicting it , a sign of the chaos , fear , behind-the-scenes maneuvering and Byzantine conspiracy theories the flamboyant Mr. Pickens has engendered since he acquired a 20. 2 percent stake earlier this year in Koito , one of the Toyota Motor Corporation ' s leading suppliers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight with Koito is about invisible trade barriers . Koito , he suggests , is inefficient , poorly run and overly dependent on Toyota . The company has denied him any posts on its board . With his engaging Texas drawl and talk about shareholders ' rights , he has denounced Japan ' s fear of foreign investors and sought support from members of Congress and influential Bush Administration officials. // But in Tokyo , the Pickens-Koito-Toyota fight is being advertised quite differently . " It ' s simply a hostile takeover effort , " says Tsutomu Ohshima , executive vice president of Toyota . In addition , Mr. Pickens has hinted that he may run for Governor of Texas next year , and many here suspect that a fight with the Japanese would not hurt such a candidacy . Underworld Manipulation ? Moreover , Koito and Toyota say that if sokaiya do invade the meeting , it will be because Mr. Pickens ' s Japanese allies sold them stock and planned the melee , to create the impression that Koito is silencing the Texan . They suggest that Mr. Pickens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is not a stupid man , " an adviser to Koito said on Monday . " But Japan is a very complicated place. " // Tokyo has never seen a corporate fight like this one . And if a clash does materialize on Thursday , it will undoubtedly add to the lore of Japanese annual meetings , where any notions about this country ' s reserve , politeness and distaste for conflict are quickly swept away. // The sokaiya have been feared for years , shaking down companies with the threat of asking interminable questions at annual meetings unless they are paid off in advance to " research " answers . A few years back they kept Sony executives answering questions for 12 hours . For companies willing to pay the price , however , the sokaiya can prove useful. // " They look pretty tough in their black suits , and they can be very good at discouraging " other investors from asking questions , said Michael K. Young , a Columbia University professor who has studied the sokaiya and their ties to Japanese gangsters. // Tough new laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underground . But just the suggestion that Mr. Pickens and the sokaiya will be playing in the same arena on Thursday , maybe on the same side , has sent the Japanese business press into a frenzy . <> <> Coaching Sessions for President // It has also sent Takao Matsuura , president of Koito , into training. // " It might be a long day , " Mr. Matsuura said in an interview on Monday , taking a break from his intensive coaching sessions on how to deal with the sokaiya . " The most important thing is to make sure that Mr. Pickens has a full hearing. " // He added , " I am preparing fully , " sounding determined but looking like a man who would rather return to the obscurity of running his small corner of the Toyota empire. // The police , too , expect some action . They plan to deploy plainclothes officers inside Koito ' s meeting hall and keep reinforcements just outside the door . But their planning is complicated by the fact that more than 1 , 500 Japanese companies will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the sokaiya can not be everywhere at once . <> <> Pickens ' s Suit Rejected // Even without the help of sokaiya , Koito shareholders might have questions for management on Thursday . The company ' s earnings have been erratic in recent years , and declined 16 percent in the year that ended March 31 . Sales growth is steady but unremarkable. // Mr. Pickens ' s aides suggest that Koito is simply a pawn of Toyota and that it lowers prices and gives up profits on command . Mr. Pickens sued to get access to Koito ' s tax returns , but a Japanese court ruled on Friday that the company was not required to disclose them. // Mr. Matsuura said the profit decline was caused by " fierce competitiveness " from Japanese rivals . Toyota ' s investment in Koito , and the fact that three top executives , Mr. Matsuura included , are former Toyota executives , is no assurance of the car giant ' s business , he said . " When I was sent to Koito in 1972 , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just be sending orders to you . You will have to make a lot of efforts. ' " // Clearly Koito is taking Mr. Pickens seriously . It has hired Wasserstein , Perella &; Company , now allied with Nomura Securities , to wage a defense . Meanwhile , Koito and Toyota are mounting a campaign to tar Mr. Pickens for his ties to Kitaro Watanabe , the closest thing Tokyo has to a T. Boone Pickens of its own. // Mr. Pickens bought his Koito stake from Mr. Watanabe , a somewhat reclusive billionaire who owns one of Japan ' s biggest luxury-car dealerships , called Azabu Motors , and real estate in Japan and Hawaii . <> <> Stock Price Soared // Koito and others have said that Mr. Watanabe and another investor started accumulating Koito shares in 1987 . As speculators flocked to the stock , the price of Koito ' s usually thinly traded shares rose from 800 yen ( $5. 70 ) to about 2 , 000 yen ( $14. 20 ) . // It was then that an agent of Mr. Watanabe offered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yen each . The company refused . So did Toyota . " We told him that since you picked the shares up in the market , you should dispose of them in the market , " Mr. Ohshima said. // Mr. Watanabe instead took the shares to the United States and eventually found Mr. Pickens , who bought the stock for an estimated $840 million . Koito shares are now trading around 4 , 300 yen ( $30. 70 ) apiece , nearly 25 percent more than Mr. Pickens paid . Analysts say the stock is wildly overvalued. // Mr. Pickens ' s motives are almost as mysterious as the sokaiya ' s . Few believe he really wants to become an active member of the Koito board . He has almost no chance of winning control of the company. // But a growing number of Japanese sympathize with his complaint that the Japanese ownership system ignores shareholders . " The Koito case clearly suggests the need for a change in Japan ' s traditional business practices , " The Japan Economic Journal said on Monday. // Mr. Pickens , asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just smiled // " It could be , " he said , his grin growing bigger . " I ' m just a simple boy from a small town in Texas. " //
