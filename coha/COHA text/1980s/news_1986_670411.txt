The West Virginia Senator acted when an initial tally produced a 47-to-47 tie , which would have allowed Vice President Bush to vote , breaking the tie and assuring confirmation of Mr. Manion. // Mr. Byrd then switched sides and voted in favor , which put him on the winning side of a 48-to-46 tally to approve the nomination . Under Senate rules , this gave him the right to call for reconsideration of the decision , which he did immediately. // // Decision Off Until July // Now the Senate will not make a final decision on Mr. Manion until after the Independence Day recess . Mr. Manion ' s legal background and political views have come under attack by Senate Democrats and legal scholars. // The Senate has been debating for several weeks whether to seat Mr. Manion , an Indiana lawyer , on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit , in Chicago , despite statements by more than 40 law school deans who have said Mr. Manion is unfit for the bench. // Today ' s vote followed hours of tense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate Democrats protesting the quality of the Reagan Administraton ' s judicial nominees . In a radio address last weekend President Reagan said the nomination had been blocked for political reasons . <> <> Opponents Still Hopeful // Aides to Republican senators said they believed there were now enough votes to confirm Mr. Manion . A final vote was scheduled for late this afternoon but put off , they said , out of fear that Democratic lawmakers would make use of parliamentary maneuvers to delay a vote indefinitely. // Opponents said they still hoped to defeat Mr. Manion , a former state legislator in Indiana . They said , however , that the Administration has been engaging in political horse-trading to place Mr. Manion on the bench. // In an apparent last-minute effort to win the Senate vote , Administration officials indicated today that they would go forward with another nomination , this one to a long-vacant seat on a Federal court in Washington state. // After that decision , Senator Slade Gorton , a Washington Republican , withdrew his threat to block Mr. Manion ' s appointment . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorably than Washington state , " the Senator said , noting that he still considered Mr. Manion ' s qualifications to be " no more than marginal . " <> <> Rejection Appeared Probable // Mr. Manion , a 44-year-old lawyer in private practice in South Bend , has not served as leading counsel in any Federal trial , has written no scholary articles and has been tied to the political work of his father , a founder of the ultraconservative John Birch Society. // His supporters said Mr. Manion had a reputation for integrity and would quickly master Federal law . He would be serving on a court that is one step below the Supreme Court. // Earlier this year the Senate Judiciary Committee for the first time rejected a judicial nominee of the Reagan Administration , Jefferson B. Sessions 3d . It originally appeared today that Mr. Manion would become the Administration ' s first judicial nominee to be rejected by the full Senate. // But in the final minutes of voting this afternoon Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum , a Kansas Republican who had opposed the nomination , agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional pleas from Senator Dan Quayle , an Indiana Republican who is a close friend of Mr. Manion and one of his chief supporters in the Senate fight . <> <> Respect for G.O.P. Leaders Cited // " I oppose Mr. Manion ' s nomination and continue to do so because I don ' t think he meets the high standards " for nominees to the Federal bench , she said in a statement after the tally. // But she withdrew her vote , she said , after being told that Senator Barry Goldwater , an Arizona Republican , had planned to vote for the nomination but could not be found. // In an interview , she said she later learned that Senator Goldwater had not given his permission for the " pairing " of his vote with hers . But that was now over , she said. // With her vote gone , the count was 47 to 47 , which would have permitted Mr. Bush , who was presiding over the Senate , to cast a tie-breaking vote and approve Mr. Manion ' s nomination. // With only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his move , changing his vote on the nomination from " no " to " yes. " // Although the change swung the vote in Mr. Manion ' s favor , it also provided Senator Byrd with the chance to call for the vote to be formally reconsidered . Senators are permitted to ask that a vote be reconsidered only if they are voting in the majority . <> <> Attack by Democrats // In debate today leading up to the vote , Senator Byrd and other Democrats made a sharply worded attack on President Reagan ' s decision to nominate Mr. Manion to the appeals court. // " We must draw the line , we must take a stand , " said Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum , an Ohio Democrat . He said he wanted to send a message to President Reagan : " Do not send us nominees like Mr. Manion. " // Several Republicans vigorously defended the appointment , however , saying that political opportunists had mischaracterized Mr. Manion ' s background and political views. // " We ' re doing a real injustice to the process , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who don ' t know Dan Manion . Those who know him almost universally support him . " <> <> Byrd Moved for Vote // Senators had been expected to vote today on a motion to limit debate on the issue , but Senator Byrd offered to proceed directly to a vote on the nomination after Republicans complained that Democratic senators would stall the vote by a filibuster. // Senator Bob Dole , the Republican leader , initially balked at accepting the offer because two Republican senators , Paula Hawkins of Florida and Bob Packwood of Oregon , were absent. // He finally agreed to the vote after two Democrats , Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware and Senator Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii , offered to abstain to " pair " their votes with those of the two absent Republicans. // Democrats later said they made the agreement because they believed they would win the vote . They were buoyed when Senator Gorton told his Republican colleagues that he intended to oppose the nomination. // But Senator Gorton ' s plans changed after what his spokesman described as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a long-stalled judicial nomination in Washington , of William L. Dwyer , would go forward. // " When I was assured that my concerns would receive the same consideration as those of Indiana , I voted in favor of Mr. Manion , " Mr. Gorton said. // Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d , who has led the Administration ' s effort to place conservative judges on the Federal bench , said he was " gratified " by the Senate vote today. //
