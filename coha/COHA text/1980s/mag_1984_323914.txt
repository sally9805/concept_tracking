The extraordinary scene of Pope John Paul II huddled in intense conversation with his would-be assassin had an emblematic quality for hundreds of millions of Roman Catholics . In appearance , if not content , it echoed an ancient tradition of the church : confession of personal sins to a priest . <P> That encounter was not , however , meant to administer the Catholic sacrament of penance . Mehmet Ali Agca 's education in his own faith , Islam , apparently is spotty , but he probably has a general awareness of its teaching that God will weigh each person 's deeds on the Day of Judgment . A practicing Muslim invokes the Almighty 's mercy during the five prescribed daily prayer sessions . But for John Paul , penance and absolution have very precise meanings . Penance is one of the Catholic Church 's seven sacraments . Baptized Catholics , before receiving Communion , are required to confess contritely all then- " grave sins " ( for example , adultery ) to a priest , and they are encouraged to confess lesser misdeeds .

John Paul not only visits Rome 's prisons and parishes but hears confessions at St. Peter 's Basilica on Good Friday ; he is the first modern Pope to do so . <P> John Paul designated penance as the topic for last October 's synod of bishops , not only because he stresses the sacrament 's importance but because its practice nowadays is in a state of flux and confusion . Theologians disagree over what sort of sins require absolution , and whether young children should confess before making their First Communion , as the Vatican desires , or a few years later when they may have a better understanding of the nature of sin . A majority of U.S. parishes now offer face-to-face confession with a priest as an alternative to the austere , anonymous meeting in a booth .
