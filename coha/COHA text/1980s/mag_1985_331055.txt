An unbeliever claims that only 10,000 people in the entire world are followers  --  cultists , really  --  of the durable and idiosyncratic rock band called the Grateful Dead . What gives the band its undeserved appearance of popularity , he adds with exasperation , is that Dead Heads , as these fans call themselves in what should be apology but probably is boasting , are so zonked on Dead music that they all show up for every concert , no matter where on the planet it is played . <P> " I do n't know , " says J.R. , 25 , an engineering student from the University of Massachusetts . " I missed some concerts this year . " He is standing in a very chilly line outside the Civic Center auditorium in San Francisco , where in something like five hours the Dead will go onstage . J.R . is making what sportswriters call a great second effort to get serious about college , he says , his first effort having been stopped for no gain by , in part , too many Dead shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semester was to hitchhike across the continent , with little cash and no tickets , to attend all three sold-out concerts in San Francisco . He has managed to score tickets somehow and now is a happy man . <P> It can be argued that there are at least 37,351 Dead Heads , because that many attended an outdoor concert at Saratoga , N.Y. , last summer . But even 37,351 is a statistical flyspeck in the megahyped world of rock music . The fact is that in almost 20 years of playing , the Dead have never managed to record a song that sold enough copies to make it as a hit single . They have had fair success with albums , but their ecstatic , visionary offshoot of rock spins with improvisation , and the necessity to nail things down in a studio version tends to fossilize the band . <P> What the Dead have managed , however , are those 20 years of playing , with most of the same early- ' 60s rebels and LSD voyagers who started the group . The original keyboard and harmonica player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hard living in the early ' 70s , and the present keyboardist , Brent Mydland , is the only relative newcomer . Otherwise the Dead are still Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzman on drums , Phil Lesh on bass , Bobby Weir on rhythm guitar and , first among equals , Jerry Garcia on lead guitar . <P> One of the striking qualities of the Dead Heads ' obsession with the band is that although it is highly personal  --  the fans think they can sense how Bobby and Jerry feel during any given song  --  it is remarkably unintrusive . The Dead Heads do n't seem to know or care what bandsman is dating or divorcing whom .
