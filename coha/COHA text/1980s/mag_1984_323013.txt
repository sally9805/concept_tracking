The survivors barely had time to mourn when suddenly there they were : American lawyers . Looking for business . They courted Indian legal experts over leisurely meals in New Delhi 's finest hotels . They culled documents at makeshift relief offices outside the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal , seeking the names of potential clients . Their motives , the U.S. lawyers insisted , were pure . As Melvin Belli , the flamboyant San Francisco attorney sometimes called the " King of Torts , " put it , somewhat inelegantly , " I am here to bring justice and money to those poor little people who have suffered at the hands of those rich sons of bitches . " But others saw less admirable reasons for the legal presence . Said Mont Hoyt , chairman of the American Bar Association 's international law and practice section : " They 're trying to get a piece of the settlement . " <P> The lawyers , who under standard contingency-fee arrangements in the U.S. can earn 30% of the awards they win in a personal-injury case , are hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster ever . Mega-claims have already been brought against Union Carbide in a number of U.S. jurisdictions where the company does business . Belli is seeking $15 billion in a class action filed in Charleston , W. Va . The Santa Monica , Calif. , law firm Gould &; Sayre has put in a $20 billion class-action claim in New York City . Coale &; Associates of Washington expects to represent thousands of Bhopal victims in a suit that will probably be filed in Connecticut . <P> Though some legal actions have been started in India , the focus of activity is in the U.S. , where the financial rewards are potentially greater . " The price of life is worth less in India than in the U.S. , " said Hoyt bluntly . In addition , riling fees for damage suits in India are almost prohibitively high , and the courts are notoriously slow . " If the suit were filed in India , the judgment would be in the next century , " said Nani Palkhivala , one of India 's most respected attorneys . More important , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case . Lawyers can file a suit for negligence , under which a plaintiff would have to prove carelessness on the part of Union Carbide . But more appealing is the doctrine of strict liability , under which negligence need not be proved . Said Belli : " It does n't matter that you did n't intend to bring harm . What matters is that it happened . In this Bhopal case we can damn well prove that it happened . " His plan : " We 'll have videotape of all those poor bastards who are sick and dying . We will have a brochure on every single person who was killed . " <P> Before U.S. jurors and judges see such grim testaments of the tragedy , however , the question of jurisdiction must be resolved . The American lawyers representing Bhopal clients argue that suits can be brought in the U.S. because Union Carbide India is 51% owned by the Union Carbide Corp . of the U.S. and is thus an agent of the parent firm . The U.S. corporation , they further contend , is responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cautioned Hoyt , who has represented Union Carbide in other matters : " Just because you have equity in a company does n't mean that company is your agent . " The plant in India , he suggested , might have been " fairly autonomous . "
