That 's the message of an unusual NBC pitch to youth <P> You can be somebody with a plan of your own , You can say no and you wo n't be alone , You can make yourself get higher than you have ever known , By making up your own mind , Doing things your own way , Setting up your own style , By being yourself . <P> By the end of next week , television viewers may know those words by heart . Set to an up tempo , the jingle will air nearly every hour during prime time on NBC for eight days . The oldest network is undertaking the most unusual public-service campaign in the history of television-and a major programming gamble . Every series episode will begin with a celebrity introducing the song , which is intended to be a rallying cry against teen-age drug abuse . <P> Such all-out attention is normally reserved for a national crisis . NBC says teen use of drugs and alcohol is just that : by age 17 , 70% of all youths have sampled one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season will be an antidrug special , half grim documentary , half musical extravaganza . The show , Get High on Yourself , also centers on the jingle , which is presented five times in pop , rock , acid rock , country and gospel versions . Warbling it among a huge cast will be 55 entertainment and sports celebrities , ranging from tuneful Olivia Newton-John to frog-flat Paul Newman . ( Among others : John Travolta , Cheryl Tiegs , Tracy Austin , Muhammad Ali , Carol Burnett . ) A week later the NBC campaign will close in a Bob Hope special , with a call by the comedian for a continuing , nationwide antidrug alert . <P> The whole effort has been guided by Hollywood Producer Robert Evans , 51 ( The Godfather , Chinatown and Popeye ) . Evans has never worked in TV before . But then , he has never faced so special a challenge . In July 1980 Evans pleaded guilty in a New York federal court to agreeing to buy 5 oz. of cocaine for $19,000 . Judge Vincent Broderick deferred judgment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year 's probation . In return , said Broderick , " I want you to use your unique talents where others have failed in this horrible thing of drug abuse by children . " <P> In a field dominated by scare tactics , Evans held to an affirmative theme . He committed $400,000 of his own money and recruited Steve Karmen , composer of the / Love New York theme , to donate the jingle . Get High on Yourself would ask " drug-free American heroes " to talk about the pleasure , and glamour , of life on a natural high . Just as important , during the 6-hr , taping of the commercials , the " heroes " would mingle with a racial rainbow of youngsters . <P> The special began as a single 60-sec. commercial and , with NBC 's encouragement , just grew . It is a pastiche of folksy , campfire sing-alongs ; rafter-shaking black church music ; gritty rapping between Burt Reynolds and streetwise teens ; and documentary footage about the making of the commercials and the special , with touches of Hollywood self-satire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them " white bready . " But there is plenty of funk in Rocker Ted Nugent . His hair hangs in crimped strands halfway down his bare , sweaty chest , and he talks in a singsong urban-punk cadence about how to stay straight while being more cool than the druggies . When he sings , the mild jingle becomes a heavy-rhythm wail .
