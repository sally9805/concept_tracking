When Anna La Barbera , a 33-year-old psychotherapist from White Plains , N.Y. , bought a silver fox coat in 1984 , she did so with joy and absolutely no hesitation . She would like to replace the aging fur , however , and she is in a quandary . " There 's nothing like the warmth of fur , " she says . But her physician husband is concerned about animal rights , and the arguments of anti- fur activists have moved her . " I 've been struggling with the dilemma of buying fur , " says La Barbera . " I like the look , but I feel real guilty . " She is now shopping for good-quality wool coats as well as for furs . <P> La Barbera 's dilemma is increasingly common among American women . Until recently , owning a fur coat , usually a mink , was an unquestioned emblem of luxury and social status . But lately a growing cadre of animal-rights activists has been aggressively denouncing such garments as " sadist symbols " that , they say , require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( about 50 minks for each coat ) . That emotional claim has touched off a bitter battle that pits the animal lobby against fur owners and an increasingly embattled fur industry . So nasty have the hostilities become that in some cities around the country women wearing furs are being publicly jeered or otherwise harassed . <P> Animal-rights groups have steadily gathered force . Last month Trans-Species Unlimited , an animal activist organization , staged its fourth annual Fur-Free Friday in 90 cities across the nation . In New York City some 3,000 protesters , led by perennial TV game-show host Bob Barker , marched down Fifth Avenue carrying signs and taunting fur-coat wearers with shouts of " Shame ! " Says Barker , who resigned last year as host of the Miss Universe pageant because contestants wore fur : " We want people wearing fur to be embarrassed when they walk into a restaurant . Fur is obscene , fur is cruel , and fur is archaic . " Two weeks ago , the city council in Aspen , Colo. , voted to put on the ballot an initiative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort town . Says Aspen Mayor Bill Stirling : " As a community , we do n't want to earn our sales- tax dollars from cruelty to animals . " <P> The furor has also hit the media . A recent segment of the popular TV series L.A. Law involved a furrier who sued an animal-rights group for ruining his business . The show aired gruesome video clips of animals caught in brutal leg traps . On an upcoming episode of Designing Women , narcissistic Suzanne Sugarbaker is mauled by anti-fur activists . When Atlanta disk jockey Scott Woodside this month mentioned that he had bought his wife a mink coat , listeners deluged his station with calls . The result was an informal poll in which the anti-fur forces carried the day , 702 to 684 . Said Woodside : " I was extremely surprised . " <P> While most anti-fur groups work by moral persuasion , a few animal activists have adopted extreme , even criminal tactics to advance their cause . In New York City they have sprayed coats with paint . On Fur-Free Friday several fur shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-fur commandos have even attacked fur wearers to gain attention . Their campaigns have succeeded in depressing fur sales in Britain , Holland and West Germany . Diana , Princess of Wales , has publicly stated that she will no longer wear furs .
