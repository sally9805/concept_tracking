But the Japan Defense Agency ( JDA ) refused , giving the excuse that there wasn ' t enough time to arrange a security clearance for the ministry officials to enter the building. // In Washington , officials of the Commerce Department were steaming over the Pentagon ' s decision to block their access to the deliberations on the same deal. // The FSX negotiations grew into one of the most bitter conflicts in US-Japan relations in decades , raising questions about the basis of the postwar alliance. // The Bush administration ' s $6 billion deal to co-develop the FSX fighter with Japan faces opponents in the US House of Representatives . They charge that the deal amounts to a giveaway of critical US defense technology. // // A measure to restrict the deal passed the House last week , but by far less than the two-thirds margin of 290 needed to override an expected presidential veto . The Bush administration says the restrictive legislation would tie its hands in any future talks with the Japanese. // A close look at the FSX decisionmaking process reveals a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bilateral agreements when governments are divided. // Such battles between government agencies and their allied interest groups in Japan have plagued US-Japan talks on a variety of trade and economic issues , most recently on telecommunications , and threaten the progress of any future negotiations. // Americans are not surprised to hear of such fights within Washington , not only between Congress and the White House but between different agencies of the government . But Japan is usually depicted as ' ' Japan , Inc. , ' ' a well-organized entity which tightly meshes the interests of business , the bureaucracy , and politicians. // Actually , Japan is riddled with internal battles . Dutch journalist Karel van Wolferen , in a recently published , controversial book , depicts the Japanese system as a uniquely headless monster , where the government is unable to control competing power groups . She suggests that lack of a strong center makes negotiations with Japan almost hopeless. // The FSX deal fits that description of a fractured power structure . The role of the prime minister ' s office in resolving the FSX negotiations suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of a role as central decisionmakers. // The FSX negotiation which led to a formal Memorandum of Understanding ( MoU ) between the two governments last November was reached between the two defense establishments . The agreement to co-develop the plane , based on the American-designed F-16 fighter , was a compromise between Japanese advocates of home-grown development and pressure to buy a US plane . The JDA was itself deeply divided over the issue . Civilian bureaucrats favored cooperation , but the Air Force brass and JDA researchers linked up with the aircraft industry in favor of solo development. // Amid the confusion of a new US administration , the Commerce Department stepped in to challenge the agreement . As congressional and other critics joined a growing chorus , the administration decided in mid-February to review the agreement. // THE Japanese did not understand that the deal was coming apart until Feb. 25 when Secretary of State James Baker met with then Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno , during the funeral for the late Emperor . The Japanese were looking for a sign of commitment to the agreement . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' surprise attack . ' ' He said Japan could sweeten the pot by guaranteeing that US companies would get a 40 percent share of the production of the FSX , a demand the US had pushed and then dropped in earlier talks. // According to both Japanese and American participants in the meeting , Mr. Uno abruptly dismissed the idea , seeing it as an attempt to reopen talks on an official agreement . Mr. Baker quickly dropped the subject . Uno then tried to end the meeting on a polite note by vaguely indicating the possibility of continued discussions on the FSX issue. // At that point , reveals a Japanese participant , foreign ministry officials believed the Baker proposal was not a serious initiative . But Japanese defense officials accuse the ministry of opening the door to more talks by not firmly refusing any further discussion. // Behind his calm exterior , Baker was ' ' irritated personally at the sharp response , ' ' says a US official . Baker saw his proposal as a way to defuse congressional opposition to the FSX . But Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Baker had not briefed US State Department officials on his plans . In normal practice , this would have been discussed in preliminary talks to pave the way for the ministerial level meeting. // The Baker-Uno meeting brought Japan ' s Foreign Ministry into the issue to join the defense negotiators . It also brought Baker into an alliance with US Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher. // On March 20 , after a long review , the US informed Japan that it wanted to ' ' clarify ' ' the MoU , a polite way of demanding a renegotiation of its terms . The 40 percent production share was now a hard-and-fast demand , along with tightening controls on the technology to be shared with Japan. // AT this point the Japanese government was split . The Foreign Ministry leaned toward accepting the US position . But in Japan ' s Defense Agency , angry voices were raised . The Air Force , says the US official , was ' ' the strongest element in trying to see the whole thing come apart . ' ' The Foreign Ministry is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outsider , inclined to put the relationship with the US ahead of Japanese interests. // The civilian bureaucrats in the JDA had mixed feelings . They were committed to the deal with the US , but under pressure from the Air Force and those who say Japan ' s technology is superior. // ' ' It is natural for those engineers to want to have more of the work share to make things by themselves , ' ' explains Jiro Hagi , head of the JDA ' s Defense Planning division . ' ' I was afraid our techno-nationalism would expand into the Japanese parliament and gather strong support. ' ' // Then Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita , in the midst of his own political crisis , left the issue in the hands of Seiki Nishihiro , the JDA ' s most senior bureaucrat who had engineered the original FSX agreement . Mr. Nishihiro arrived in Washington on March 23 , believing he could sit down with the Pentagon and bargain. // Nishihiro was shocked to find no familiar Pentagon officials on the other side of the table . The Pentagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tower ' s nomination as defense secretary. // ' ' Suddenly there was nobody whom we could talk to , ' ' recalls Mr. Hagi . The Japanese found themselves facing tough-minded State , Commerce , and White House officials. // And when Nishihiro offered the US a 35 percent production share , he found Mr. Baker particularly intransigent. // The domestic political pressures on Baker were never clearly grasped by the Japanese . ' ' They were so focused on their own side of it , that they weren ' t sympathetic to the congressional problem , ' ' says the US official. // When Nishihiro returned empty-handed , the Japanese government was stuck with no coherent policy . Besides the Foreign Ministry and Defense Agency , the Ministry of International Trade and Industry ( MITI ) was also involved in what became a three-way bureaucratic deadlock. // The deadlock might never have been broken , most participants agree , without the intervention of Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Ichiro Ozawa , acting for the Prime Minister. // Mr. Ozawa held almost nightly meetings in his offices over several weeks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consensus , essentially accepting the US demands. // Based on the Ozawa precedent , some see the Prime Minister ' s Office , or kantei as it is known , beginning to take on a central decision-making role. // Without Ozawa ' s involvement , says an informed US official , the FSX talks ' ' may well have failed. ' ' // The kantei lacks the authority or even the personnel of a White House . But , a kantei official argues , there is a structural change going on , the result of dealing with international problems which cross ministerial boundaries . ' ' Now it is necessary to decide as quickly as possible , ' ' the official says , ' ' otherwise those issues become much more politicized , ' ' and more difficult to settle. // //
