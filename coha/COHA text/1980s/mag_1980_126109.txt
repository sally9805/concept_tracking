Ride in the heat long enough , with the old truck lumbering axle-deep in warm mud , and your eyes start to deceive you . Brilliant dragonflies begin to look hawk-sized and the vultures soaring in the brassy skies over Colombia turn to massed hang gliders . The city of Cartagena and its Caribbean breezes have been left 40 miles behind on the north coast , and you are deep in the savanna , with patches of sugarcane and clumps of banana trees in the grassland and the swamps of the Magdalena River valley . There are four more miles to go , half an hour 's travel along this grotesque track , to the village of Palenque , more properly Palenque de San Basilio , and the extraordinary people who live there . // But getting to Palenque seems less likely every minute . Deep sloughs of chocolate mud abruptly give way to acute ups and downs over naked rock , and there is one terrifying bridge over a ravine , a lash-up of steel pipes and logs , that makes you close your eyes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-wheel drive , the truck slithers and spins , sometimes stopping altogether , so that the passengers crammed into the open rear must clamber down to give it a chance to back out and try again . // This enrages one of the riders in particular , a small , lithe man as deeply black as his companions but standing out from their manifest poverty by reason of his expensively embroidered shirt and his elegantly polished shoes . Speaking corrosive Spanish-Creole , gesturing emphatically , he makes it clear that this ridiculous track is an insult to himself , to his neighbors and to Palenque. // En garde , Your Excellency the Governor of the State of Bolivar ! Have a care , O President of the Republic ! Not for the first time , Palenque is on the warpath , and now it is led by the Kid  --  who on his birth certificate is Antonio Cervantes but , now and forever in Latin America , is Kid Pambel. // It was he who , but for a short spell in 1976 , held the WBA world junior welterweight title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cincinnati took it from him . At that time the Kid was 34  --  going on 40 , people freely said . He had had a glorious career  --  84 wins in 96 bouts since 1964 , 40 of them by knockout  --  maybe the best 140-pound record of all time . But now ( though inevitably he talks of one more bolsa , one more big payday before he hangs up his gloves ) the next trophy he seeks is a real road , a good road , for his beloved Palenque , his hometown. // Into which eventually , miraculously , the truck rolls , finally stopping in the dirt plaza . Your eyes must be playing tricks again , because this seems to be West Africa , not South America . The equatorial sun beats down on children playing in the dust , black , naked children with the pot bellies and the reddish tinge to their hair that come from a poor diet . The huts are mud-daubed on a frame of bamboo , with thatched roofs , and the womenfolk sit in the shade of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because a handful of men , silent , no glasses in their hands , sit on the steps of a shack with a sign that reads TIENDA DE LOS POBRES . The Store of the Poor Ones . // Skeletal dogs , chickens , piebald piglets roam in the heat . Passivity and poverty seem to rule , life passing slowly amid dirt and sunshine . // It would be difficult to be more wrong . Leave the people for a moment to let them wake up to the presence of Pambel , their champion . Walk over to the Church of Saint Basil , where there is the first hint of Palenque 's unique heritage , although the walls are almost bare and there is n't a single chair in the place . // There is , however , a tall , handsomely painted wooden image of Saint Basil ( and another of a woman next to him  --  his wife  --  because the Palenqueros think it would be a shame for even a saint who formulated many of the rules for monastic life to be lonely ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , say the villagers , contains blessings he will one day vouchsafe to them . One of Saint Basil 's presumed blessings is right there beside the statue , sharing pride of place with a crucifix . It is the golden trophy that Kid Pambel brought home from Panama City in 1972 when he defeated Alfonzo Frazier for the junior welterweight title . And nearby it on the wall is a bed sheet on which a poem in Spanish has been lettered with loving care by one of the nuns who visit the village from time to time . // No se puedo sepultar la vida , No se puedo sepultar a un pueblo Que busca la libertad Como estrellas siempre brillaran Porque aun muertos seguieron viviendo Porque el pueblo nace cadadia You can not bury life , You can not bury a town . Follow freedom , that shines constantly like the stars . Then , even though death follows living , The town is born again each day . // Between trophy and poem is a connection that goes back almost four centuries . The history of Palenque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bolivar Province , is that of a long battle for freedom unparalleled in the Americas . // But consider a smaller story first . In the last decade , from this community of fewer than 3,000 people have come three world boxing champions : Kid Pambel himself ; Rodrigo Valdes , who held both the WBC and WBA middleweight crowns at various times between 1974 and 1978 ; and Ricardo Cardona , who won the WBA junior featherweight title in 1976 , lost it this year to Leo Randolph , and is in training to regain it . // How , from the dust and poverty of this village , an entirely black settlement in a predominantly white and Indian nation , could such an achievement possibly have come about ? Certainly there is a well-attested link between hunger and boxing titles , but almost invariably it is a big-city phenomenon . The crowded ghetto is where the astute scout seeks out promising fighters  --  in the rings of settlement houses and in recreation halls . But Palenque ? // For the beginning of an explanation , one must return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Palenque have been working since dawn with the crops and the cattle and this is the noonday pause . Soon they will come to life again . Meanwhile , remember the poem and its cry for freedom and prepare yourself for something more astonishing even than the troika of champions . // Almost two centuries before the U.S. declared its independence from England , even longer before the Latin American republics broke from Spain . Palenque was a free , self-governing community , existing precariously , but surviving nonetheless by means of unremitting guerrilla warfare against the Spaniards in their fortress-city of Cartagena . Primer pueblo libre de Amrica ( the first free town in the Americas ) is the title claimed for Palenque by the Colombian historian Roberto Arrzola. // The ancestors of the people now living in the village were slaves , shipped from Guinea in West Africa around 1540 to Cartagena , then the principal slave port of Spanish America . Their early history is misty , but certainly by 1580 sporadic rebellions had taken place , and in 1599 the biggest , most purposeful of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of free Palenque . In Spanish-Creole the name means " Fortress . " // And a fortress it had to be . The first big Spanish expedition against the Palenqueros was launched in 1603 , against what Cartagena was calling " this rebellious and terrorist power . " The Spaniards came clanking through the rain forest in their heavy armor , and they were beaten back . For two centuries they continued to be beaten back as , raiding and burning , the black guerrillas launched hit-and-run counterattacks. // So successful were the Palenquero warriors that in 1621 the Spaniards actually signed a peace treaty with them , allowing them to come and go freely in Cartagena itself . The treaty did n't last , of course . By the end of the century the governor of the province was offering a bounty on black heads , those heads to be ceremonially spiked in the main plaza of Cartagena while from the great cathedral the Te Deum rang out . // Nevertheless , Palenque survived , and in the end ft was economics , not military might , that brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Colombia . By then , slavery no longer paid . Little by little , white landowners moved inland . They employed most of the Palenqueros , who are a tall people , with six-footers common , as low-wage workers . // Territorially , present-day Palenque is only a fraction of what it once was , but in many ways its battle still goes on . Until recently , at the point where the road to the village branches off from the main road , there was a billboard , set up by a soft-drink company , which displayed a menacing Kid Pambel and the legend , in Spanish , PALENQUE , CRADLE OF WORLD CHAMPIONS . Nearby , however , was a white village which the Palenqueros call Malagana , the Bad Feelings town , and the billboard was soon defaced with black paint , then torn down . To this day in white Cartagena and its environs , Palenqueros are regarded as bad news , a low form of life . // Which is one of the reasons why Pambel feels so deeply the need to fight for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had postponed a morning meeting with the governor of Cartagena and canceled an afternoon business flight to Barranquilla  --  thereby condemning himself to a six-hour bus ride later that evening . He wanted to acquaint some visitors from the U.S. with his village , the hut he was born in , the problems his people had , hoping that the visitors would add their voices to his . He had begun speaking out in 1972 , from the moment he won his title . // At that time the Colombian government , bursting with pride over the country 's first world champion , asked Pambel if there was anything he might want . " Light for my people , " he declared . Two years later electricity came to Palenque . But the champ had to wait four more years for his next triumph  --  piped water . And now he was fighting for a road . " Apart from anything else , " he said seriously , " the women have to walk along it at night , coming home from selling their fruit . With those rocks and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // Pambel 's arrival back in the village had put an end to siesta time . The first to close in on him were the motherly ladies of the town , hooshing the piglets away , scattering the kids , hugging him , checking him out critically . " You look thin , Pambel , " they cried . " Look how thin his legs are ! Please eat properly , Pambel ! " Then the kids squiggled through the cluster of elders , escorting Pambel down the road to see how his new house was getting on . // In his prime years Pambel had made and kept enough money to live in style , to push his deprived boyhood in Palenque into a corner of his mind , had he wanted that . He owns a new house in Cartagena , a fruit farm outside the city and apartments in Boca Grande , and he regularly invests in Latin American boxing promotions . Now , however , Pambel was building a home in Palenque . He was spending so much time there , he said , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he find such good friends as his old comrades of Los Estrellitos de Palenque ? // The Little Stars of Palenque , who could they be ? Ah , now we are closing in on the secret of the village , its secret of survival , and the secret of those world titles . The Little Stars are what Palenqueros call a cuadro ( " cadre " is the nearest English equivalent ) , a group of boys , 15 to 20 in number , all of an age , who came together when they were very young and have remained together , practicing fighting among themselves and boxing against other village cuadros . The girls have similar groups , cuadrillas , and they box also , though the sexes never meet in combat . In spite of the colorful names they bear and the insignia they sometimes adopt , the cuadros are light-years away from being street gangs , West Side Story-style . Members of different cuadros will fight in the streets freely enough , but never to the menace of life , never with territory in mind , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the military society that the villagers had perforce developed in their bloody wars against the Spaniards . The community became a kind of Afro-American Sparta . As soon as they could walk , boys and girls were trained in the martial arts , forming groups structured by age for the purpose . Weaponry , of course , died out long ago , but fist-fighting and the cuadros have survived . As has the tight-knit comradeship they inspire . Kid Pambel will be a Little Star until the time when those that remain of his cuadro will mourn his passing to the beat of drums during the prescribed nine-day wake . // " The cuadros are straight out of Africa , " Nina de Friedemann will tell you . " You get the same thing with the Turkanas and the Nandis in Kenya , the Karimojong in Uganda . " If anyone should know , it is de Friedemann , a Colombian anthropologist of international repute , who was a Fulbright scholar at the University of Alabama last year . She is a small , animated woman of 45 to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among her fellow Colombian anthropologists , who rarely concern themselves with the black segment of their country , preferring instead to study the indigenous Indians . That concentration makes de Friedemann angry . " Colombia was not just made by the whites and the Indians , " she says spiritedly . " The great fortresses of Cartagena were put up by the blacks , stone by stone . " For five years de Friedemann has studied Palenque and its unique culture . Winning acceptance by the Palenqueros was a considerable feat . Though they are not overtly hostile to whites , they are inclined to be silent in their presence or to withdraw into their houses . // But de Friedemann gets a Pambel-style welcome when she comes to town . " Hey , Ninita ! " the villagers call , and she is hugged with pleasure . Anyone in her company is given the same reception . // She is a little puzzled when you remark on the seeming miracle of three world champion boxers having come from such a small community . " But of course , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . A micro-society , " she corrects herself , " that has come to revolve around boxing . " She is not herself deeply interested in world boxing titles , but she readily provides a historical explanation for that phenomenon . " These people have had almost four centuries to learn distrust , " she says . " In their minds they 're still guerrillas . Defense is everything to them , and to defend you must attack . " // She continues : " When you go back to Cartagena , look at the Palenquero women who sell fruit on the beach . If there 's trouble , and there often is when white Cartagenans make slighting remarks , watch how the women react . They do n't yield an inch of ground . Their voices drop down the register to a frightening growl . They 're never intimidated . No slave mentality there . These women are fighters . Come , I 'll show you how they train . " // At the far end of the village , a swift creek flows between muddy banks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Palenque 's drinking supply , its laundry , the bathing area for its women and children  --  this area of the creek was off limits to all adult males . On the creek banks , women fought at times , and small girls learned the ritual of insult and fistfight . When the government water started to flow , de Friedemann believes , the ritual began to erode . But recently , when the main water pump failed and no one seemed in a hurry to fix it , the women were back at the creek again , as if nothing had changed . // When the visitors to Palenque went down to the creek , a fierce lady standing knee-deep in the water started to give them the rough edge of her tongue for their intrusion . She was making plain signals that she might take the matter further when she noticed that the visitors were under Ninita 's protection . // She moved away , her indignation still plain , but other Palenquero females stayed put  --  little girls sent to fetch water , mothers sluicing down their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid in the red-and-white-check frock. " de Friedemann said , " and the other one in the pink . " // To get clear drinking water you dig a hole with your hands in a gravel shoal so that it fills nicely with well-filtered water . And once you have dug a hole , you protect it . // The defending champion , in pink , was Gertrudis Cassiani , nine . In red and white , in the other corner , the challenger , Antonia Rosada , 10 . " They 'll talk first , it 's a ritual , " de Friedemann said . " I could tell you what they will say already , but I 'll translate . " // " Give me that waterhole . It is my right . "  --  ANTONIA . // " It is my water . I was here first . "  --  GERTRUDIS. // The voices got lower and rougher . " The ritual is in the tone of the voice as well , " Nina whispered . But it does n't end there . // Out of nowhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fight was on . There was no screaming , no scratching , no wrestling . It was a formalized fist duel , the little arms going like pistons . The bout was over quickly . Seemingly , no damage had been done , and soon Antonia was contentedly digging her own hole , not a difficult task . " They are learning to survive for when they leave the village and meet strangers , " de Friedemann said . // Still , fighting among the women of Palenque grows rarer , though an attempt five years ago by a police inspector from Cartagena to put an absolute stop to it failed ignominiously . The ladies just paid their 50-peso ( about $1 ) fines and kept at it . Most fights originate at the creek , and they can be savage affairs that include kicking and mud-throwing . Formal bareknuckle women 's fights are still staged at Easter and Christmas . " Amongst the women , just as amongst the men , fist-fighting is a cultural mandate , " de Friedemann says in her anthropologist 's way . // All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Dilsa Salas is a handsome girl of 22 who left the village to train as a nurse and now is back working at a small clinic , which a doctor from Cartagena visits twice a week . " Last Easter , " she says disapprovingly , " the streets were swarming with girls , big and little , all dressed in bright frocks , and it looked like a huge rainbow ready to fight , with fists sticking out of it . I never fought myself . " Salas allows , though , that she has never been condemned or even teased because of her noncombatant stance . She says the same ethic applies to boys . Those who do not wish to fight are n't harassed . They suffer no sanctions in everyday life . // " A strange people , " de Friedemann says . " You know , after four centuries here they still complain about the heat . Carry those huge colored handkerchiefs around to mop their brows . " // Ten years ago , the village culture almost took a U-turn when many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxers . That was when Marlon Brando arrived to shoot a film called Burn . It had to do with a slave rebellion , and Evaristo Marquez , a Palenquero , was a co-star . But the whole thing was a nine-day wonder . Marquez spent his money on rum and the village got nothing . // Two years later Kid Pambel won his championship , and the Kid made a far better hero than Brando . Many , maybe most , of the village homes boast a picture of him , usually set only a little below one of Christ or the Virgin and well above those of Dr. Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala , the president of the Republic , and Simn Bolvar , the liberator of Colombia . // So there are no would-be movie stars in Palenque now , and no shortage of small boys who dream that one day , preferably on June 14 , the feast of Saint Basil , they will emulate the Kid and carry a world championship trophy in procession to the church and place it on the altar . However , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a title will not be via the traditional cuadro structure but by more conventional methods . // The road into Palenque may be dreadful , but the village is no longer as remote as it once was . As the reputation of its fighters spreads , promoters , not only from Cartagena but from Venezuela , are willing to risk the ride . More and more boxing equipment , though it is still pitifully scarce , is finding its way into the village . And among the older boys there is a sense of shame about the cuadro system . Although it has served Palenque well for centuries , it is now coming to be regarded as somehow backward , something that should be swept out of the way of progress . // Even so , at three in the afternoon , when the sun has lost some of its intensity and it 's time for boxing practice , you can still meet a few lovers of tradition , a few conservatives who cling to the old order . They will be on their way to Celia Casseres ' cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who despise gloves and rings and a referee calling " Time ! " // Two such , encountered in the street on the way to Celia 's place , were Perfecto Cassiani , 11 , and Eberto Cassiani , 10 ( they are n't related ; Cassiani is a common name in Palenque ) . Both were proud to be members of the cuadro of the Boquiteros ( the Little Mouths ) and both were happy to make their position clear . // " I want to fight the Estrellas , " Eberto said . // " I want to fight anybody I see , " said Perfecto. // Whereupon , there being no Estrellas around , the pair went at each other in a whirlwind of fists , and suddenly it occurred to the observer that this is just what old boxing writers of the bareknuckle era meant by " milling . " No attempt at defense on either side , only a furious , rhythmic two-fisted onslaught , as nonstop , as mechanically flailing as , well , a mill . // Nothing of this , though , impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or four years senior to the milling pair . // " These two are well-known street fighters . " Natividad sniffed . // " I am not in a cuadro , " Jesus said . " We are not making them anymore . Our trainer said we must not fight in the street . " // " I hate to fight in the street , " said Natividad . " These boys fight too hard , like they are fighting to kill . " // And , indeed , Perfecto had an inch-long scar over his right eye . A boxing injury ? " Nah , " Perfecto said . " My cousin threw a rock at me. " // By then the fury of the younger boys had spent itself , and together , chattering happily , they continued on to Celia 's corral . There a ragged hemp rope was passed around some trees to form a ring , and the yard was cleared of pigs , turkeys and ducklings . Celia turned out to be a lined , battered-looking woman ( " My God , the fight she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse ) . She received a grand total of $2 in pass-the-hat proceeds for the promotion . // In minutes the stockade became a whirl of activity . Tiny boys , unmindful of the action in the ring , milled , sparred and flung themselves Kamikaze-style at a woebegone bag that hung from a mango tree and slowly leaked its stuffing . Jesus and Natividad , the purists , worked out solemnly , one jogging rhythmically on an old tire , the other skipping with a frayed and knotted rope . // In the ring , two youths , 17 or 18 years old , fought with some style . Cutting in now and then to instruct them was Alesandro Herrera , Palenque 's official trainer , the man who is most against cuadros and street fighting . By Palenque standards , he was dressed in the height of fashion : embroidered shirt , pressed pants , lace-up shoes . " Tiempo ! " he called suddenly , and the fighters instantly quit . // Until recently , de Friedemann said , rounds had been signaled by someone whacking an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else new : the young boxers had appeared wearing protective headgear . The headgear was fourth-hand , to be sure , but it represented yet another stage in the evolution of Palenque 's fighting tradition from guerrilla warfare to the sophistication of modern boxing . // Should that evolution be deplored ? Accepted as inevitable ? The cuadros and their defiant names dying out , La Gente Brava ( the Brave People ) , Vendaval ( the Windstorm ) , passing into history like the bugle calls of a cavalry brigade ? // Most Palenqueros have few regrets , including the latest of its title winners , Ricardo Cardona . At present Cardona is in Miami , where in a bout last Friday he stopped Ralph Barrios in the first round . That impressive victory should give him another shot at a title bout and the chance to regain the WBA junior featherweight crown he won in ' 76 . Like Pambel , Cardona speaks in a heavy , melancholy Creole tone when Palenque is mentioned . " Mi cuna my cradle , " he said . " I owe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cuadros , no . " I was always independiente " Cardona says , " never in a cuadro . I think it is fine that Alesandro wants to take the fights off the streets and put them in the gym . That is the way for fighters to learn . " When he retires , Cardona says , he would like to participate , to help Alesandro in the village . // That last sentiment is n't shared by Rodrigo Valdes , the third Palenque world champion . Valdes  --  " Rocky , " he signs himself  --  is 33 now , and you can find him hanging out most days in the Mercado de San Andresito , a street market in a rough section of Cartagena . There , it is said , you can buy all manner of smuggled goods . You enter , if you are sensible , without your wallet or your watch . " At the moment , " Valdes said recently , " I 'm not doing much , just playing some soccer , seeing my friends . End of November I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . Uh , I 'd like to take a shot at Antuofermo. " // Rocky Valdes was a fine middleweight ( 61-7-2 ) who had the misfortune to be around when the incomparable Carlos Monzon was lording it over the division . Nevertheless , he held the WBC title from ' 74 to ' 76 , when Monzon took it from him to add to his WBA crown , and when the Argentinian retired in ' 77 , Valdes inherited both . He had only one gear , people said  --  top  --  and that smoking . Fighting that way twice against Monzon in long , bloody battles , he sacrificed himself on the Argentinian 's fists . When he lost both titles in the spring of ' 78 to another Argentinan , Hugo Corro , he was almost a burned-out case . // And now Valdes does n't wish to know about Palenque . " Pambel invited me once , " he said , " but I did n't go . " At times Valdes says he was born in Cartagena , at others that he does n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought up in Gesemani , a poor quarter of Cartagena , where many migrant Palenqueros live . // But according to Pambel and just about everybody else , Valdes was born in the tiny village of Rocha , a kind of satellite of Palenque , where members of the Valdes family traditionally provide the drummers who attend all Palenquero funerals . " I grew up among Palenqueros , " is as far as Valdes is willing to go . That , and the classic " I have a lot of close friends in Palenque. " // Back in that village , de Friedemann confessed that in spite of her presumed neutral status as an anthropologist , she always brought gifts of boxing gloves when she visited because the kids pleaded for them so desperately . " Really , though , " she said in extenuation , " it 's almost 50 years since the first Palenquero wore gloves . " And to prove it , she left Celia 's corral , walked 200 yards down the street and made another introduction . // World champions notwithstanding , if one needed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle , its indomitable spirit , one would choose Don Fermin Herrera . He is 75 now , but massive-chested and upright . Unofficially but unmistakably , he is Palenque 's leader . // In 1926 , when he was in his 20s , Herrera had walked the 200 miles to Guacamayal in Magdalena Province on the coast to find work in the banana plantations of the United Fruit Company  --  " The Company " he calls it , as if it were the only one in the world . " I was so poor , " he recalled , " that I had only strength to scratch one ear . " All the same , though , he said he had many fights in Guacamayal . Mostly they were in the streets , but five times he fought professionally as a middleweight . " I fought as ' Charolito , ' " he said ( Charolito is how the Colombians describe shoes that are black and ultra-shiny ) , " and I only lost once . My biggest purse was when I beat a man called Palbiche , from Barranquilla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You could buy 10 head of cattle for that then ! I did n't , though , " Don Fermin added sheepishly . " I had fun . " // Which came to an end abruptly in 1936 , when the banana workers struck against the Company and the soldiers opened fire on them . " I saw 30 dead men when the army killed the people , " Don Fermin recalled . " The first of them was my friend Erasmus Coroel , the leader of the strike . " Herrera fled home , back to the fastness of Palenque , and prospered . Three hundred head of cattle he has now , and 500 acres of land . He , too , is a believer in getting the fights into the gym . Herrera might even open one himself . " There is fine material here , " he said , " fine boys for manaa , for the future . I was the first of them , I think , and in my old age I am proud . " // Oddly , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his boxing prowess but to his cattle , which , in the African tradition , serve as work animals rather than a source of meat , except in extreme need . Each year in Palenque , a traveling bullfight troupe arrives for the feast of Saint Basil . A temporary plaza de toros is set up , and the fights are well attended by the neighboring white landowners . The Palenqueros enjoy the rum and the fiesta atmosphere , but they hate to see the bulls bothered and they regard the out-of-town fans as barbarians . Cattle are family . It is legitimate , though , for the kids who herd them to use them as punching bags , to try out jabs and combinations on the animals ' unprotesting flanks as they are herded home in the evenings . // Back at Celia 's corral , Alesandro and the big boys with the headgear and the gloves yielded the ring to the little ones . The bouts were short and ferocious , and the limits of the ring meant nothing . Swiftly , half a dozen informal battles broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouragement now began squaring off with one another . // Alesandro was n't amused by this , nor could he understand why the visitors could be bothered to watch the unstructured display . " Come , come , " he said impatiently , " and I will show you the Coliseum . " // A few streets away stood a building under construction , a simple cinder-block structure . " Here , " said Alesandro grandly , " will be the showers . Here the room of the trainer . Here the heavy bag , the ring , the exercise equipment . The Coliseum will open in January . " Goodby cattle corral . Goodby $2 promotions . ' Alesandro , the nephew of Don Fermin , had many plans . One had the impression he was apologizing for the here-and-now Palenque , that he could n't wait for the Palenque to come . // Now at Celia 's corral it was time for the girls to get their chance , and if betting was possible  --  something notably absent from Palenque  --  you would certainly have a little something on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rita certainly was having the better of the action as Celia commanded the visitors to look at some colored snapshots of her son , 18-year-old Heriberto Torres . He is Palenque 's newest hope , 32-3-0 as an amateur super flyweight and now training in Cartagena. // Joining the visitors , Pambel looked at the photos . " Heriberto came to me when he was 12 , " he said . " He knelt down and he said , ' Pambel , I beg you , give me some boxing gloves . ' When he learned to read , I told him . " // And indeed Heriberto did learn . One day not long ago he was on his way to train at a gym in Cartagena , carrying his book bag from the Liceo de Bolivar , a high school . A modest-mannered , good-looking lad , he had been " discovered " by a Cartagena promoter , Orlando Pieda , who now pays his expenses to live away from home . There seems little chance of Heriberto ever denying his heritage in the manner of Valdes. // He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windstorm . " Did Nina tell you that the Windstorm made itself her personal bodyguard when she first came to Palenque five years ago , so she would n't be insulted or bothered ? " he asked . He had to concede , however , that the cuadro tradition was failing . " There will always be good fighters in Palenque , though , " he said . // And picked over more thoroughly than ever , no doubt , by scouts when Alesandro opens his gym and Pambel gets his road . They will be better prepared than in the past , however , and in any case , for the Palenqueros there is really no other choice . " We have been voting for years , " one woman said , " but it was a boxer who brought us our electric light and our water . " // So it goes .
