They ' re singing gospel and clapping hands here in George Foreman ' s church . Brother Foreman is clapping , too , and swaying and singing . This huge vulnerable man used to be the heavyweight champion of boxing . In an earlier life , George Foreman fought Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali . Now he ' s in there against the big guy with the pitchfork . Sinners , read on . " A lot of guys used to say to me , George , you ought to go back to boxing . While you ' re young , you can fight a few years and then you can go back to preaching . ' " NO , " I said . I ' m going to do ALL I CAN for the Lord while I ' m YOUNG , while I ' m STRONG . I ' m not going to WAIT until m going to go and get with HIM right NOW ! Thank you , Jesus . " This is the First Church of the Lord Jesus Christ , and those are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congregation ' s members , poor people , are happy to have such a man on their side . When he says he will help them fight evil , they believe they will win that fight . " Thank you , Jesus , " they say . " Amen , " says Foreman . The First Church of the Lord Jesus Christ was founded recently by Foreman and his friend , Dexter Wilson . " On the day of the Pentecost , " Foreman proudly points out . Foreman is not a licensed minister , but the technicality matters not to his congregation . In their hearts , he is for real . " George has the calling , " says Wilson , 19 , whose electric guitar accompanies the gospel exuberance . The congregation meets in the homes of its members because it can ' t afford a permanent building . Tonight , the service is at Jack Wingo ' s house , a four- room bungalow on anunlighted , unpaved street in northwest Houston . There is a single naked lightbulb on the ceiling and wooden folding chairs set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the pulpit . A picture of Jack Wingo ' s baby girl is on the end table next to the sofa . Dexter Wilson ' s electric guitar and amplifier are plugged into a socket . Thirty people come to pray - all black , half children and most of the rest women . Somehow , they squeeze into the room , the smallest children crawling under the chairs . Foreman , wearing blue jeans , plaid shirt , and cotton bush jacket , dwarfs his pulpit . He begins by telling the children to listen quietly or risk being " rapped upside the head . " He eases into his topic - marriage and fidelity . It is a spontaneous sermon . It is rambling , but what it lacks in structure it makes up for in feeling . Wilson , sitting on the amplifier , encourages Foreman in a low voice . " Five , twenty-two Ephision , " says Foreman , thumbing his Bible . The voice is strong and sympathetic . " Wives submit yourself to your husbands as unto the Lord . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that ' s why we can ' t have no women submitting themselves to nobody else but their own husband . If you got a husband , that ' s why you got married , to have someone to submit yourself to . Thank you , Jesus . " Some of these men want to counsel these women . They want to explain to them . No , no , don ' t you explain to them . God will take care of them . They say , No , I got to explain . ' No , you don ' t ! The Bible say let the older women teach the younger ones . Thank you , Jesus . Okay ? " He reads , " The husband is the head of the wife even as Jesus is the head of the church . . . " I was talking to a woman , and she was telling me , When a woman love a man , she don ' t ever stop loving him . She might marry somebody else , but she never stop loving him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally I had to say , Sister , that ' s a lie . ' " She don ' t get into bed with nobody but the one she loves . She don ' t do it ! She don ' t get into bed with another she might have did in the past . " She said , I don ' t know , let me think about that . You might not know , you ain ' t no woman . ' " I said , Well I know because I love Jesus Christ ! I don ' t go messin ' around with the Lord . You think I ' m going to go jumping from bed to bed and defile myself ? Maybe the Lord don ' t need me now , but when he do , I ' m going to be pure and ready for him . That ' s right ! I ' m going to be RIGHT THERE ! Thank you , Jesus ! " When a woman love a man , she be right there . I don ' t care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years . I don ' t care if a man come to her with a big Fleetwood and a million dollars ! She say , No , I ' m going to wait for the one I love . ' Thank you , Jesus . ' Foreman ' s forehead is glistening . A mosquito contemplates it but doesn ' t land . Dexter Wilson speaks next and briefly . And then they sing . My , how they sing loud , bluesy gospel . My , how Dexter plays his guitar . " I don ' t need nobody but Jesus " I don ' t need nobody but the Lord " You know God come from above " And He died that I might live " And I don ' t need nobody but Jesus . " A basket is set out and the two-hour service is over . Foreman is standing outside Jack Wingo ' s house . " Did you plan your sermon ? " he is asked . " No , " says Foreman . " I don ' t know why I talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted me to give somebody tonight . " He is grinning as a thought occurs to him . His second marriage recently ended in divorce . He is supporting four children , one from his first marriage and three born out of wedlock . " I don ' t know , " he says . " Maybe that message is for me . " " Will you marry again ? " " Oh sure , " says Foreman . " I ain ' t against marriage like all those Popes they got in Europe . " Foreman won an Olympic gold medal at Mexico City in 1968 , waved an American flag in the ring and became famous or infamous , depending upon one ' s perspective at the time . He was a patriotic black man with a ghetto ( Houston ' s Fifth Ward ) and Job Corps background . " That was my best moment as an athlete , " he says today . " I still love this country . " He won the heavyweight championship in 1973 by knocking down undefeated champion Joe Frazier six times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 , 230 pounds , undefeated , and considered perhaps the most powerful puncher in boxing history . But he was no boxer , and Muhammad Ali took the title from him in 1974 with an eighth-round knockout in Zaire . " As a boxer , I think I ' ll be remembered as much for beating Frazier as for losing to Ali , " says Foreman . At this point in Foreman ' s life , religion was a perfunctory exercise . " I used to go to church to meet the ladies , " he says . " I remember in Africa , Ali called me a Christian , and I didn ' t even know what that was . I thought it was some nationality . " Foreman was in position for a shot at Ali ' s title in 1977 when he unexpectedly lost a 12-round decision to Jimmy Young on St. Patrick ' s Day in San Juan , Puerto Rico . Some people say a fight is not the only thing Foreman lost that night . Foreman says God spoke to him in his dressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to life . He believed that Jesus had come alive in his body , and that the blood on his body was caused by a crown of thorns on his head . His handlers conferred and decided something was wrong with Foreman . " Everybody thought I was crazy , " says Foreman . " Eight people tried to hold me down , but I jumped up and got under the shower and was screaming , I ' m purifying myself . ' " I told them all , You ' re witnessing a miracle . ' " His handlers and closest friends believed he was hallucinating , perhapsfrom dehydration , and sent him to a hospital . " They examined me from head to toe and never did find nothing , " says Foreman . " You know all this science fiction stuff on television today ? Ain ' t nothing as strange as what happened to me . " After Puerto Rico , Foreman intended to continue boxing , but gradually religious fervor overtook him . " I intended to come back and tell the people what happened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on boxing and do the whole deal . But this thing got greater and greater every day . Every day I lived , it got a greater hold on me . " He quit boxing at the age of 28 . " I was coming into my prime , " says Foreman . " I was just learning what it was about . These last four years would have been my best as a boxer . " The address is in the fashionable North Hollow subdivision in North Houston . The modern house is in the $150,000 range , and there are comfortable front and back yards . The house dwarfs Jack Wingo ' s , where the service was held , but Foremankeeps it off limits to his congregation . " I don ' t want no single ladies coming in here and getting no ideas , " he says . Inside is a parody of bachelor dishevelment . A set of barbells and a bench occupy the center of the den . Awards , pictures and mementos sit atop the boxes they were moved in , waiting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medal , however , was stolen a few years ago . " I try to work out to keep my weight down so I don ' t have to buy new clothes , " says Foreman . Conspicuous by its absence is a television . " I don ' t watch any television , " says Foreman . " I get my news from the papers . I haven ' t watched a boxing match in four years , but I read about them . " ( When the name of WBA heavyweight champion Mike Weaver is mentioned , Foreman says , " Who ' s Mike Weaver ? " ) Foreman weighs 270 pounds and most of his added weight seems to have gone to his face , which is broader and fleshier than it was when he fought . His close-cropped hair adds to that impression . The way he looks now , Foreman would have a hard time returning to the ring . But that possibility is remote or nonexistent . " I ' m happier now than I ' ve ever been in my life , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niche . " I don ' t condemn boxing or any sport . The Bible doesn ' t say nothing against it . What I condemn is the spirit of it . Greed and avarice . That ' s all it is . Everybody after all money and fame . The Bible says , Ye shall seek the kingdom of God . ' That ' s what is important . It ' s like a little kid who plays in the dirt . He grows up , and one day it ' s not right to play in the dirt anymore . " The founding of his new church was an important step in his evangelism . He started out by preaching on the streets and in parks , and there his boxing identity made all the difference . " I used my past as bait , " says Foreman . " The people in the streets cared about boxing , but the people in my church don ' t care about it . " Prior to the founding of his church , Foreman belonged to another Pentecostal congregation , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left when it seemed to him he was being exploited by the minister . Nancy Foreman , his mother , claims that Foreman gave at least $118,000 to the church . " I stay away from false prophets , " says Foreman . " If I know a man ' s major goal is raising money , I don ' t associate . " His own fortune , he says , has evaporated . He still owns a 200- acre ranch in Marshall , Texas , but all the cattle have been sold . His fleet of foreign sports cars and Cadillacs has been reduced to one sedan . The house is his . The man who made $5 million for one night ' s work in Zaire now sells industrial cleaning supplies to make ends meet . " I don ' t spend a lot , " says Foreman . " It don ' t take a lot of money toserve God . I have a saying : I made the wagon . ' I ' ve broken away from the material life . I don ' t need it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxed , you could make a lot of money and feed poor people . ' But that ' s not the kind of food I want to give them . I could make $5 million and feed five million people for a day , but the next day they be hungry again . There ' s no end to it . What I want to give them will stick with them forever . They can have the word of the Lord all the time . That ' s what we mean by keeping the feast . ' The more you sit at the Lord ' s table , the more He give you . " Within the Houston religious community , which in its Bible Belt fervor numbers 2000 churches , Foreman has built a quiet but sound reputation . " At first everybody believed that at the first temptation to go back to boxing , he would , " says Rev. John Lawson of Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church . " When Spinks beat Ali , and he didn ' t go back , it was obvious he was serious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Rev. John Westbrook of Antioch Baptist Church , which counts running back Earl Campbell among its members . " A lot of charlatans build a name by condemning every church in town . I haven ' t heard anything negative coming out of his church . " Foreman says he wants to return to all the places he fought - to preach . He will continue to be fervent as long as " visions " keep coming to him as they did in Puerto Rico . " I had one come to me in my sleep , " says Foreman . " I was in Times Square , and there was this man who looked like Elvis Presley playing a guitar . And on the big message board they got there with all the lights , I Love You ' was spelled out . " That was God letting me know He remembered me . I get visions all the time , but only when He ' s ready . It don ' t matter when I need one . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
