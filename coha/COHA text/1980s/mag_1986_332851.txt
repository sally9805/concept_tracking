" We ended up as friendly as we started , " declared Britain 's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at the close of a special two-day meeting of seven leaders of the 49-nation Commonwealth last week . Actually , relations between Thatcher and her Commonwealth colleagues were strained at the beginning of the session and got steadily worse . In the end Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi accused Britain of " compromising its basic values for economic gain . " An even angrier Kenneth Kaunda , the President of Zambia , described Thatcher as a " pathetic figure " who was " worshiping platinum and gold . " <P> The issue , of course , was economic sanctions against South Africa , which 48 Commonwealth governments support but Thatcher has steadfastly opposed . She argues that sanctions would work hardship on millions of blacks in South Africa and neighboring countries while failing to destroy apartheid ; she also feared the effect they might have on Britain 's estimated $18 billion investment in South Africa and its $3 billion in annual trade with that country . <P> Present at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaunda , were Prime Ministers Brian Mulroney of Canada , Robert Hawke of Australia , Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Sir Lynden Pindling of the Bahamas . On the second day of the meeting , Thatcher dropped her opposition to a proposed European Community ban on South African coal , steel and iron , and said she would accept " voluntary " restrictions on new British investment and the promotion of South African tourism . For the other six leaders present , this was nowhere near enough . Together they endorsed a set of sanctions proposed at a previous Commonwealth gathering that included a ban on agricultural imports , new investment and air links . For good measure , they added a ban on new bank loans and the import of uranium . <P> Within hours South Africa demonstrated how seriously it considered the Commonwealth action . " You can rest assured we are not going to take this lying down , " declared Foreign Minister Roelof ( " Pik " ) Botha . At a Pretoria press conference he announced what amounted to retaliatory actions . One was a levy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the north . A cash deposit of 25% will now be required for imported goods bound for Zambia . In addition , a slowdown immediately went into effect at the Beit Bridge crossing between South Africa and Zimbabwe , as officials began a " statistical " study of the " nature and extent " of all goods moving across the border . Decrying what he called the " hysterical stampede " against South Africa , Botha challenged Mugabe and Kaunda to " put their money where their mouth is and introduce comprehensive sanctions against this country . " Zambia condemned Pretoria 's action as " blackmail and intimidation . " Mugabe , on his return to Zimbabwe , told his countrymen to brace themselves for hard times . " All thought of luxury and comfort will have to go , " he said . " It is just like a war . "
