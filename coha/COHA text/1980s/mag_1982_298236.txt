It looked like a cross between a gigantic camp meeting and the gathering of the lost tribes of Israel . First singly , then in twos and threes , finally by the trainload , land-hungry Americans gathered along the edges of a stretch of the Oklahoma Territory known as the Unassigned Lands . Through most of April 1889 , soldiers patrolled the edges of the area to keep anyone from crossing into the territory prematurely . <P> The occasion was the opening of nearly 3,000 sq . mi. of the Oklahoma Territory to settlement . For decades , the U.S. Government had been content to use the land , which it had acquired in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 , as a resettlement ground for displaced Indians . But after the Civil War , the white settlers began demanding parts of the territory . Cattlemen wanted to drive their herds to market along the Chisholm and Shawnee trails ; America 's new immigrants wanted land for farms . Ignoring Government restrictions , settlers known as boomers began to squat on lands in the territory . <P> On March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one month , 1,887,796 acres , or some 4% of what eventually became Oklahoma , would be opened to settlement . Pioneers could claim 160 acres . <P> At noon on April 22 , soldiers fired their pistols in the air , and the territory was up for grabs . Some 50,000 settlers , many galloping on horseback , others riding in wildly careening wagons , a few sprinting on foot , raced to find a good piece of land they could claim as their own . Almost everyone got something-except the Government . It had planned to charge settlers $1.25 an acre . Eleven years later , with only a fraction of the money paid , it waived the charge .
