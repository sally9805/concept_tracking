Frantic finale to a fourway , multibillion-dollar takeover fandango <P> Coming soon . . . the blockbuster business epic of the year ! See corporate giants devour one another in titanic clashes . See captains of industry race against midnight deadlines to save their power and prestige . Will Bill Agee of Bendix Corp . and his beautiful blond bride Mary escape the clutches of Martin Marietta Corp . ' s menacing Tom Pownall ? Will tough old Harry Gray of United Technologies foil their plans to find happiness in the embrace of Ed Hennessy of Allied Corp. ? Find out in Takeover , the drama that asks the question : " Is this any way to run a company ? " <P> It began as a fairly straightforward corporate merger fight . But by last week the multiplying twists and turns in the convoluted takeover battle between Bendix Corp. , the Michigan-based aerospace and auto-parts manufacturer , and Martin Marietta Corp. , a leading defense contractor of Bethesda , Md. , had become an embarrassing parody of Big Business in action . Seemingly unconcerned about the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's top executives were threatening each other with multibillion-dollar stock ploys , while jetting cross-country for clandestine strategy sessions , tying up courtrooms from Michigan to Maryland and wasting millions of dollars in the process . <P> By last Thursday , Martin Marietta , with 1981 sales of $3.3 billion , had acquired 46% of Bendix stock for some $900 million . But Bendix , with 1981 sales of $4.4 billion , had bought 70% of Marietta 's shares for $1.2 billion . While Bendix and Marietta were scrapping , Allied Corp. , a New Jersey-based conglomerate , with 1981 revenues of $6.4 billion , lumbered into the fray , offering in effect to take over both companies for $2.3 billion . <P> Finally , in a dramatic finale on Friday , the three combatants reached a truce . Allied would acquire Bendix for $1.9 billion , and Marietta would remain an independent company . If the deal goes through , the firms will have spent about $4 billion , much of it borrowed from banks , to buy and shuffle about one another 's shares . Yet no one seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The boardroom saga began last month with a bid of some $1.5 billion by Bendix 's ambitious chairman , William Agee , 44 , to buy Martin Marietta and thereby acquire that firm 's prestigious and profitable defense business . Stung by Agee 's move , Marietta President Thomas Pownall , 60 , launched a counteroffer of about $1.5 billion to buy Bendix instead . In addition , he persuaded United Technologies ' chairman , Harry Gray , 62 , who over the years had built his company into a $14 billion conglomerate with a string of successful takeover raids , to make a parallel bid for Bendix . The two men agreed that if either company gained control of Bendix , they would divide up Agee 's firm between them . But United Technologies ' involvement soon raised antitrust questions , and by last week Gray had ceased playing an active role .
