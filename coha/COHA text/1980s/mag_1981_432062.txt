 | Summer sunlight glistens on the President 's big oak desk . Standing around it , six White House aides are engaged in intense debate while Ronald Reagan , seated in a swivel chair , listens attentively . The discussion jumps quickly from one topic to another ? the economy , a Supreme Court vacancy , Congress . Reagan nods , drums his fingers on his desk and volunteers a joke : " We do n't want them to find out that if they do n't pass my economic package , I 'm going to appoint me to the Court . " This scene in the Oval Office ? typical in a day in the life of the nation 's 40th Chief Executive ? was one of many private meetings witnessed by U. S. News &; World Report during a rare close-up look at the President at work . The day was June 23 , which White House aides described as Reagan 's " busiest " in more than five months in the nation 's highest office . The President characterized it as his " worst " day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Democrats balking at his economic program , he had decided to step up his daily activity . Between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. , he presided over more than a dozen meetings , made four speeches and greeted nearly 500 official visitors . This hectic pace left little doubt that the 70-yearold President has recovered from the bullet wound he suffered in an assassination attempt on March 30 . Although it was by no means a typical day , the schedule reflected the variety of events at Reagan 's White House ? breakfast with House Democrats who supported his budget , meetings with staff , a private talk with NAACP President Benjamin Hooks , lunch on the patio with ocean explorer Jacques Cousteau , photographs with new ambassadors before they depart for foreign posts , two meetings with cabinet members and receptions for House Republicans and GOP teen-agers . There were moments of triumph and joy . The Democrats ' applause , the shyness of a girl receiving a jar of jellybeans from the President , the enthusiasm of teen-agers at a party in the Rose Garden ? these brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Secret Service Agent Timothy McCarthy was back on the job for the first time since he was wounded trying to shield the President on March 30 . A new style . The day had its frustrations , too . Budget Director David Stockman brought news of temporary setbacks in Congress . The crush of events left the President little time for paper work , which piled up on his desk . A spirited cabinet debate presented him with a tough decision to make . There was even one embarrassing moment when Reagan , using the wrong notes , read a 60th birthday greeting to a teen-age audience . What emerged from this bird's-eye glimpse was a portrait of a President with a unique style . Reagan keeps a tight schedule , but spurns long hours in the office . He spends most of his day with people , not papers . He insists on hearing an issue debated before making a decision . He sets broad policy and allows aides to work out the details . As an administrator , Reagan is detached and sometimes formal . He never removes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he 's working there alone with his feet propped up . Although he spends most of his day in meetings , he seldom joins in the debate and rarely asks questions . At the same time , the Chief Executive makes strangers feel comfortable in his presence . In a brief lull between two meetings , he chatted about the movie Superman II . To him it reflects " a hunger for a hero . " A good storyteller , he often rewards visitors to the Oval Office with a joke . Recalling that a pub has been renamed for him in his great-grandfather 's hometown in Ireland , Reagan quipped : " Some people can have airports and bridges named for them . But I 've got a saloon . " Reagan occasionally yawns during long meetings . He doodles with paper and pencil , chews on his right index finger or plays with his glasses . Because he is slightly hard of hearing on one side , he cups his ear with his hand when he can not hear the conversation . He is a polished speaker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets of paper . The words are abbreviated in Reagan 's own shorthand . He draws lines between each point for easier reading . Although vigorous for his age , Reagan carefully avoids the appearance of  | frailty ? particularly since the shooting . Three times during the day he explained to visitors why his voice sounded scratchy . " Believe it or not , " he said , " I 'm allergic to air conditioning . " He also objected to a published report that he sometimes had difficulty getting out of his chair after long meetings . Reagan 's hectic schedule on June 23 was designed by aides to show that his recovery is now complete . But as a result of this grueling day , he appeared tired the following morning as he left the White House for a six-day trip to Texas , California and Colorado . He confided that he was looking forward to resting on his Santa Barbara ranch . Unlike most Presidents , Reagan is not usually an early riser . His day began at 8 a.m. and ended at 11:15 p.m . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family quarters . The White House operator said : " Good morning , Mr. President . It 's 8 a.m . " The call ended a restless night for the President . His wife , Nancy , was in Los Angeles preparing for the sale of their house . The two are seldom apart . The air conditioning also bothered the President , an aide reports . He awoke about 4:30 a.m. , did some paper work and fell back to sleep about 6 a.m . Awaiting Reagan when he got up was a stack of newspapers , a special summary of the day 's news prepared by the White House staff and an inchthick briefing book on the events of the day . He went first for his favorite reading , the comics . He dressed conservatively for the long day ahead : Brown suit , white shirt , brown-and-white tie . Even before the President awoke , his aides were at work . Edwin Meese , James Baker and Michael Deaver ? known as the Big Three ? met over breakfast in Baker 's spacious office at 7:30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their mission was to advise Reagan of last-minute changes in his schedule . As Reagan emerged from his quar- ters and descended the stairs at 9:08 , one of the first persons he saw was agent McCarthy . " Welcome back , " the President said . " How are you feeling ? " McCarthy assured Reagan he felt fine and added that he had enjoyed the time off . The President then continued down a flight of steps with aides trailing . His workday was under way . Seated at small tables in the State Dining Room were 38 House Democrats ? the first of 239 members of Congress who came to the White House to see the President that day . Before sitting down to eat , Reagan made his pitch for continued support of his economic program . He ate two blueberry muffins and mixed fresh fruit , washed down with decaffeinated coffee . After breakfast , the President received his daily national-security briefing . National Security Adviser Richard Allen discussed overnight developments in Poland and Asia , the composition of the new French government , latest twists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. envoy Philip Habib . Well worn . Reagan and Allen sat on wingback chairs near the fireplace in the Oval Office . Other members of the National Security Council were nearby on two facing sofas . Aside from inclusion of Reagan 's personal photos and art objects , the Oval Office has not been redecorated since he became President . The upholstery , most of it yellow , orange and green , is slightly soiled . Seated on the sofa , Vice President Bush sought advice from the group on his impending trip to Paris . State Department official Walter Stoessel , who was attending on behalf of Secretary of State Alexander Haig , said a statement had been prepared denouncing the appointment of Communists to government posts in France . It is a strong statement , he warned , and should be issued in Washington ? not Paris . Allen also provided Reagan with a written report on national-security matters . The blue leather binder remained on the President 's desk all day . He referred to it occasionally . He normally returns these reports to Allen with notations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting was a " stand up " session with six aides gathered at the President 's desk . Aside from his joke about naming himself to the Supreme Court , Reagan was silent . He sits in a swivel chair that he brought from California . He often pulls out the bottom desk drawer and props his feet on it . On the table behind are about a dozen framed photographs of his family , plus two snapshots of Reagan with the late Dwight Eisenhower . Capitol Hill lobbyist Max Friedersdorf opened the session by explaining the reasons for the President 's meetings with two more congressional groups later that day . Baker and Meese chimed in with the latest legislative news . Press spokesman Larry Speakes told the President what he intended to say to reporters . Communications Director David Gergen suggested that White House aides not comment on the selection process for a Supreme Court Justice . Meese agreed . As taciturn as he was with his own aides , Reagan was outspoken in his meeting with President Hooks of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does not understand the plight of poor blacks . Sitting again in the wing chairs , the two men became so deeply embroiled in debate that their scheduled half-hour meeting ran 45 minutes . Typically , Reagan sought to break the tension with a little joke . Like most Presidents , Reagan takes pride in some of the little changes he has made at the White House . One such change : All new U.S. ambassadors now can bring their families to the Oval Office before they go abroad . " Buon giorno , " Reagan shouted , throwing his hands over his head as Ambassador to Italy Max Rabb entered the office with his family . Rabb was one of the first Republicans in New York State to endorse Reagan . As the group posed for pictures in front of the fireplace , someone inquired about Mrs. Reagan . " She 's in California now because our house is being sold , " the President replied . " She has to clean it up . " Jellybeans . Rabb was the first of three ambassadors who visited that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burns and Ambassador to Haiti Ernest Preeg , also got warm greetings . " Wie geht 's ? " Reagan asked Burns ? German for " How 's it going ? " The ambassadors all received cuff links with the presidential seal . Wives got pins . Preeg 's daughter accepted a giftwrapped jar of jellybeans . Some Presidents have had a habit of eating lunch at their desks , but Reagan is not one of them . Whenever possible , he has lunch with a special visitor , as he did this day with ocean explorer Cousteau . They ate smoked fish , veal and vegetables from sparkling blue and white plates on a small round table on a patio near the Oval Office . Surrounded by shade trees , the patio was cool on this hot , sunny day . Although Cousteau sought this meeting with the President to discuss other matters , he volunteered his views on the appointment of four Communists to the government in his native France . He thought they would have little influence . " That 's good to hear , " Reagan replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon . The first was a cabinet subcommittee on commerce and trade . The second was a full cabinet session . Waiters brought two L cut-crystal jars of jellybeans into the Cabinet Room . The President took a handful , laid them on the table and ate them one by one . Most cabinet members did the same . U.S. Trade Representative William Brock was called upon to explain the issue facing the commerce-and-trade group . The group 's recommendation to the President was unanimous , but Brock emphasized that it was not a simple matter . " I caution you that you will catch some political heat , " he told Reagan . Lobbyist Friedersdorf was then asked to explain the political ramifications . As he did , he leaned on the back of the President 's chair . Friedersdorf 's remarks sparked a lively strategy debate that included Brock , Bush , Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger , Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis , Agriculture Secretary John Block , Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and chief economic adviser Murray Weidenbaum . Brock and  | Lewis disagreed on their interpretations of the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures again and again . In his case , it 's horses , football players , cowboys and a few distinctive faces . Deputy White House Chief of Staff Michael Deaver says the same eight or 10 figures usually show up on the President 's note pad after a long meeting . The faces are not intended to represent any real people , however . " He 's an avid comics reader , " says Deaver . " I think a lot of these doodles are characters he sees in comic strips . " The longtime Reagan aide may be the world 's leading authority on the President 's doodles . Deaver has some of the best , autographed and framed , hanging in his home . The horses drawn by Reagan have one peculiar trait : They lack hooves . The Chief Executive recently confided to Deaver that he finds horses ' hooves too difficult to draw . Sitting at one end of the table with other White House aides , Chief of Staff Baker seemed to be orchestrating the discussion . Baker 's comments ultimately brought the meeting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " declared the President after less than 20 minutes . He then promised to inform the group of his decision within one week . Most participants got the impression that the President would endorse their recommendation . Sitting on the table in front of the President throughout the meeting was a two-page , single-spaced , typewritten memo prepared for him by his staff . The memo had three sections : An explanation of the issue , the background and the options . Aides said that the President earlier had read a 57-page document outlining the issues in detail . Minutes later , Reagan banged the cabinet meeting to order with spoon and water glass . " We 've really got a tough problem if we are going to get through the whole agenda , " he announced . The agenda called for discussion of labor laws and a progress report on the economic package . Reagan yawned and chewed on his finger while Budget Director Stockman gave a gloomy report about congressional action on the administration 's budget . Stockman accused Democrats of foot dragging . " You always make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then called upon Treasury Secretary Donald Regan for a similar report on taxes . Regan 's report was illustrated with a series of charts on an easel , which a woman aide changed as he talked . Regan explained that one proposal would exempt a widow from taxes on her husband 's estate when he dies . " But she 'll have to pay taxes on that at the proper time , " he said . The President quietly added : " When she dies . " Top White House aides Meese and Baker sat together at one end of the Cabinet 's table , whispering and passing notes . During Regan 's report , they shared a private joke . Some political analysts expected these two men to be rivals in a struggle for power , but so far their relationship seems smooth . Stockman wrote a note to Baker on White House stationery : " Jim , we have ways and means of squeezing a few billion out of the budget estimates ? but it will catch up in the future . " Throughout the day , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the White House . Reagan joined it late in the afternoon . When he arrived , the committee chairman , Senator Paul Lax- alt ( R-Nev. ) , an old friend , remarked to the President privately that he seemed to be having a busy day . " Oh , " Reagan replied , " this is the worst ! " The Chief Executive 's speech to this group dealt with his plan to return revenue sources to the states . On his way out , the President was asked by Representative Jack Brooks ( D-Tex. ) whether he intended to buy a new presidential yacht . In reply , Reagan criticized former President Carter for selling the presidential yacht , Sequoia . Brooks encouraged him to buy another one . This meeting ended about 4:30 p.m . Reagan was getting tired . " I 've got a half day 's work left to do , " he noted as he headed for two more meetings ? one with personnel chief E. Pendleton James and the other with CIA Director William Casey . Reagan approved 28 new appointees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 women and 2 Hispanics . Two receptions ended Reagan 's official day . As he was preparing remarks for the events , aide Deaver handed him a reminder that Representative Paul Findley ( R-Ill. ) had just turned 60 . Findley was expected at an East Room reception for House Republicans . Outside in the Rose Garden , a party for about 175 GOP teen-agers was under way . A small orchestra from York , Pa. , was playing . The teen-agers , most of them with cameras , were drinking punch and eating cookies under a hot sun . A cheer went up and flashbulbs popped as the President emerged from the Oval Office onto the lawn . " Where 's Congressman Paul Findley ? " Reagan asked during his speech to the teen-agers . There was no answer . Deaver cringed , knowing the President was about to make a blooper . " Today Paul Findley can celebrate his 60th birthday knowing he 's still younger than the President ? who also happens to be in good health , " Reagan said . When Reagan asked the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got a better response . Findley was there . Reagan 's pitch for support from the House Republicans also prompted wild applause . He repeated an anecdote he had used at breakfast about the steel industry 's plans for capital investment under his proposed tax program . The story was the same , the figures different . Taking leave . His fatigue was beginning to show . As he concluded his remarks , the President added : " This is about the 18th time I 've had to stand up and speak and I 'm going to get the h ... Well , I 'm going to get out of here . " Dozens of lawmakers crowded around to shake his hand . Most promised their support . Representative John LeBoutillier ( R-N.Y. ) gave him a button saying , " Repeal O'Neill " ? a slam at House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill , who opposes Reagan 's economic plan . When Representative Margaret Heckler ( R-Mass. ) approached , she asked to whisper in his ear . He bent to listen . " A woman for the Court ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His reply : " I am thinking about it . " Moments later , shortly after 6 p.m. , he was upstairs relaxing in his shirt sleeves on the Truman Balcony . He read an account of his breakfast speech in that afternoon 's Washington Star . He watched the television news . His official day was finally over . The President spent a quiet evening alone in the family quarters . After a dinner of chicken , wild rice , green beans and salad , he did some more reading , went to bed and snapped out the light at 11:15.
