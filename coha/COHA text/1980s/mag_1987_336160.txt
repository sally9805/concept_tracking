Swiftly , silently , 16 trucks and buses rolled into Manila under the cover of a moonless tropical night . The curious convoy carried an estimated 800 Philippine army troops , all loaded down with weapons . According to a carefully laid plan , the vehicles split up and , as midnight approached , drove to assigned points around the city . Two of the trucks proceeded to a key location : Malacanang Palace , the headquarters of President Corazon Aquino , 54 . Asleep in her residence about 50 yds. away from the main building , Aquino did not hear their approach . <P> Shortly after 1 a.m. , a woman sitting in a snack bar near the palace saw about 50 soldiers wearing black ski masks run past . Moments later the night was shattered by automatic-weapons fire and the blast of mortars and grenades . Those unexpected sounds of combat signaled the beginning last Thursday night of the bloodiest , most dangerous coup attempt yet mounted against Aquino 's 18- month-old government . <P> Since coming to power in early 1986 , Aquino has survived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endured confrontations with the left and the right , with Communist rebels and prickly colonels . She has moved too quickly for some Filipinos , too slowly for others , as she tries to undo two decades of corrupt rule by her predecessor , Ferdinand Marcos . But along the way she has captured the imagination of both her country and the world with her gentle words and indomitable spirit . <P> Suddenly , a band of soldiers came closer than ever to destroying Cory Aquino and the country 's budding democracy . To many observers , the violent raid on Malacanang by military rightists had all the marks of a last , desperate grab at power . But even if Aquino is not seriously weakened by last week 's events , the foiled coup underscored the unwillingness of at least some Filipinos to give their President the time she needs to carry out her reforms . Once the gunfire died down and the smoke cleared , a troublesome question remained : Is the Philippines truly ready for democracy , or is it destined to slip once again into chaos ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops apparently hoped to catch the night watch of the presidential security guard by surprise . But at Nagtahan Bridge , just 300 yds. from the palace , and along J.P . Laurel Street nearby , the mutineers were stopped by heavy fire from the defenders . As the fighting raged and red tracer bullets arced through the night sky , civilians and journalists who turned out to see what was going on suddenly found themselves in a murderous cross fire . " They just sprayed us with bullets , " said Ricardo Medina , 20 . " I saw with my own eyes at least four dead on the street , with bits and pieces of brains scattered on the cement . "
