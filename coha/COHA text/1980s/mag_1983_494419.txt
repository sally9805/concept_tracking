BUDGET GRIDLOCK BY BRUCE BABBITT HE CONGRESSIONAL budget process is begin ' ning to resemble gridlock on a hot Manhattan afternoon : the traffic cops are helpless , the drivers are angry and frustrated , and it seems to get worse each year . In simpler and less acrimonious times , Congressional leaders could usually break a budget impasse and satisfy their constituents by spending a little more money . Most members , liberal and conservative alike , were reconciled to lubricating compromises with appropriations . The easygoing quality of those days was best captured by Everett Dirksen twenty years ago : " A billion here , a billion there , and pretty soon you 're talking about real money . " But nowadays the traditional politics of budget addition is not working so well . In the face of a $200 billion deficit , public resistance to tax increases , and an implacable President , the rate of domestic spending is slowing . The old politics of addition is yielding to a new politics of subtraction , in which allocating more money for one constituency will require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionary implications for the future of the Democratic Party . The social advances of the New Deal and the Great Society were achieved without hard choices , for they were financed by simply expanding the government share of that vast economic pie known as the gross national product . Eventually , however , there will be a practical limit to the expansion of government spending as a percentage of G.N.P . Consider the numbers . In 1930 , at the coming of the New Deal , total spending by federal , state , and local Bruce Babbitt is the Governor of Arizona . governments consumed about 10 percent of the gross national product . By 1950 , spending had more than doubled , to 22 percent of G.N.P . And by 1982 it had nearly doubled again , to 38 percent of G.N.P. , consuming well over a third of all goods and services produced in the American economy . If the growth rate of the past fifteen years were projected forward in a straight line , government would devour 100 percent of G.N.P . in the year 2040 . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will soon be attainable only by reordering priorities and eliminating or reducing existing commitments . The President and his budget director , David Stockman , have become astute and zealous practitioners of the politics of subtraction . They have clear priorities and are asserting them relentlessly . Programs assisting the poor have been slashed or eliminated to make way for increased military spending . Job training and employment programs have been cut by 50 percent , education by 30 percent , and low-income assistance programs by 12 percent . At the same time , subsidies for middle- and upper-income Americans have scarcely been touched , and in many cases actually increased . Mike Royko summed up the Reagan priorities best when he said , " It 's a lot easier to take from the poor than from the rich . " The " fairness " issue was quickly identified by Democrats , but so far it has not been effectively exploited . Their dilemma is tangled up with the new realities of the budget process , exemplified by the emerging differences between House Speaker Tip O'Neill and the freshmen Democrats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must either accept O'Neill 's solution ? to resurrect the old politics of addition by increasing expenditures and raising taxes ? or develop a countervailing philosophy of budget priorities that will allow us to slice the existing governmental pie more equitably . There is scant reason to expect public support for a large-scale return to the old order . The alternative to an ever larger allocation for the public sector is to restructure the existing share on the assumption that government spending is not likely to increase much as a percentage of G.N.P. , whoever the President may be . Redividing the existing public sector share has traditionally been considered tantamount to political suicide . Every elected official believes in his heart that a benefit once conferred , whether tobacco subsidy , food stamps , student loan , or depletion allowance , is soon viewed as an inalienable right ? to be tampered with at great peril . Nonetheless , today 's rules are not an immutable guide for tomorrow . T HE LODESTAR of progressive budget control is the means test . Means testing embodies the principle that government assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In recent decades this fundamental limiting concept has been eroded as constituency groups , rich and poor alike , have successfully claimed their share of federal largesse in the form of depletion allowances , pension benefits , farm subsidies , mortgage deductions , and a myriad of other entitlements and subsidies . The means test survives today mostly in a small part of the federal budget known as grants-in-aid to state governments . The grants-in-aid , constituting less than 10 percent of the federal budget , go to support state administered programs targeted at the poor such as Medicaid , welfare , food stamps , compensatory education , and child nutrition . It is here , in that small portion of federal spending already limited by the means test , that the President has concentrated his harshest rhetoric and deepest cuts . The other and larger part of the domestic budget consists of the non-means-tested entitlement programs administered directly by the federal government . They include Social Security and Medicare ( available to virtually all Americans over 65 without regard to need ) , farm subsidies , unemployment compensation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large as the means-tested poverty programs ; they consume 40 percent of the federal budget . Social Security , a $175 billion program , costs fifteen times as much as the entire food stamp program . Medicare , a $60 billion program , costs nine times as much as the federal share of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program . Yet the President is scarcely heard to talk about being frugal in this sector of the budget . The fact is that millions of Americans in this entitlement " safety net " have no need at all for government assistance . A true means test for entitlement programs would limit benefits of any kind to persons whose tax return shows an adjusted gross income of less than , say , $50,000 per year . If an absolute means test appears a bit too radical , a moremodest approach would be simply to subject entitlement payments to the federal income tax . If entitlements were taxed ? and many are not ? the progressive nature of the income tax would reduce by 50 percent benefits paid to high-income recipients . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The recent history of Social Security reform provides a striking example of how an idea , previously considered taboo for politicians , can be enacted into law . Taxing Social Security benefits was first proposed by a Presidential commission back in 1978 . Frightened by the very thought , the House of Representatives condemned the report by a vote of 378 to 0 . Just three years later , in 1981 , the President appointed the Greenspan Commission to look at the problem . Its final report included a taxation proposal that passed Congress last March without serious controversy . The experience suggests that progressive entitlement reforms , properly developed , can be enacted . The other obvious candidate for a means test is Medicare , whose costs are escalating at 20 percent a year . At this rate , by 1990 , the Congressional Budget Office says , Medicare 's deficit will be as high as $300 billion . Major legislative modifications are inevitable . One reform would be to subject Medicare to an outright means test . Or Medicare payments to doctors and hospitals could be subjected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The idea seems unusual , probably because Medicare is an " in-kind benefit " ; that is , recipients never see the money . These objections , however , are easily met by simply structuring an exemption to assure that taxes would be payable only if disposable income exceeded a specified threshold . As with Social Security payments , the progressive income tax would protect low-income recipients while providing a 50 percent reduction of Medicare outlays for high-bracket taxpayers , saving billions of dollars in the process . ANOTHER progressive approach to containing Medicare costs would be to institute progressive co-payments . Characteristically , President Reagan wants to do just the opposite . Last spring he proposed to double the annual Medicare co-payment premium from $200 to $400 annually , and to triple the physician care co-payment premium from $200 to $600 annually for all Medicare recipients , needy and affluent alike . His proposal would cut costs by subjecting all Medicare recipients to uniformly higher charges without regard to their ability to pay . The savings that the President seeks ( about $1 billion annually ) could be effected more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gross income exceeds $20,000 per year and sparing low-income recipients from further hardship . One approach aims to ravage ; the other targets benefits for those who are truly in need . Perhaps the most noteworthy and least noticed example of an entitlement program specially tailored to the affluent is the Payment in Kind farm subsidy program . PIK payments incorporate a reverse means test ; they are handed out on a per-acre basis without regard to need . The bigger the farm , the larger the payment . This year the PIK program cost $21 billion ( twice the federal contribution to all A.F.D.C. welfare programs in the fifty states ) and half that sum went to the largest ( and presumably wealthiest ) 10 percent of individual and corporate farmers . In my own state , an analysis done by the Arizona Daily Star showed that Arizona farmers received an average PIK payment of $69,200 ( the average annual welfare payment for a family of four in Arizona is $3,263 ) . One Arizona farmer received a check for $908,900 . Economists calculate that the PIK program will add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extra cost that has the same regressive impact as a sales tax . It was n't always so lush out on the farm . During the Carter Administration , farm subsidies were means tested and limited to farmers earning less than $50,000 per year . In those years farm subsidies cost about one quarter of what they do today . The tax-expenditure budget is another big-time candidate for progressive budget control . A tax expenditure , stripped of its technical definitions , is a tax loophole . And by forgoing the collection of taxes from a given interest group , the government provides a benefit identical to putting a check in the mail . In 1983 tax expenditures amounted to $250 billion , nearly one-third of the total direct federal outlays in the regular budget . T HE CUMULATIVE effect of the Reagan tax and budg- et changes of the last three years has been to increase tax expenditures , which provide maximum benefits for corporations and upper-bracket taxpayers . Any benefit conferred by a tax exemption is twice as valuable for a 50 percent-bracket taxpayer as for a 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impoverished family that has no tax liability . Congress has traditionally viewed tax expenditures as the equivalent- of Monopoly money and passed them out with abandon . They are voted through a single committee ( Ways and Means in the House , and Finance in the Senate ) , a procedure that bypasses most hurdles required for direct appropriations . For all these reasons , the Reagan Administration has used tax expenditures as a convenient way of subsidizing its allies while masquerading as a champion of shared sacrifice . Consider the case of the dividend exclusion for electric utility stock dividends . No member of Congress , not even the most fervent supply-sider , would care to advocate that electric utilities and their shareholders get direct cash subsidies from the federal government . Yet last year , in the midst of another round of austerity for human services programs , Congress did just that , presenting a $670 million gift to utilities and their stockholders by exempting from taxation all dividends reinvested in utility stocks . The biggest tax expenditure of all is also the most sacred : the homeowner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidy reserved for those who own homes ( the imputed rental value of which is also tax exempt ) . The inner-city family which rents , it need hardly be pointed out , receives no such deduction and is fully taxed on the income from which it pays rent . Within limits , the mortgage interest deduction serves a salutary national policy of encouraging home ownership . But why should n't the deduction be limited to just one residence on the assumption that anyone fortunate enough to own a condominium in Aspen does n't need help from Uncle Sam ? Or why not a " mansion cap " limiting the interest deduction to a generous figure above which owners would be presumed competent to build a dream house without a subsidy from the rest of us ? Utility dividends and homeowner subsidies are just two arbitrarily chosen examples . Anyone interested in reform can compile one 's own list from the detailed tables in a 1982 C.B.O. study entitled Tax Expenditures : Budget Control Options and Five-Year Budget Projections for Fiscal Years 19831987 . Among my favorites are exclusion of income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , capital gains treatment of certain timber income ( $600 million ) , safe harbor leasing ( $5 billion ) , capital gains basis at death ( $4 billion ) , and deferral of tax on shipping companies ( $85 million ) . T HE PROBLEM , as Robert B. Reich says in The Next American Frontier , is that " Liberal governments ? trying to be all things to all people , leery of engaging the public in the uncomfortable process of political choice ? have ended in predictable deadlock . " If liberals do not set priorities , reactionaries will ? and in fact they already have . The choices are not easy : child nutrition versus housing , welfare versus highways , cancer research versus a space station . One is always tempted to avoid the issue by casting the choice as people programs versus military spending ? teacher salaries against the MX missile , medical care against the B-1 bomber . Certainly the welfare versus warfare issues must be part of the discussion , but the debate can not end there . It is worth recalling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of G.N.P. , and that today , even with the Reagan increases , military expenditures remain below the Kennedy level at 7 percent of G.N.P . Comparisons will have to be made among all programs . Some will object that any plea for Americans to share equitably in budget austerity is doomed to fail before the resistance of entrenched interest groups , and that the proper function of a political party is to protect its constituency while carving benefit reductions from the hide of the opposition . President Reagan has shown how to do that , and in the process he has revealed himself as just another opportunistic and highly partisan politician . Democrats can do better if they will forsake the political trap of evading choices by proposing to spend more , and talk instead of how all Americans might respond to an equitable plea for restraint in the common good .
