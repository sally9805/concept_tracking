ST . LOUIS , Mich. - The sprawling collection of shacks and corrugated buildings that was Michigan Chemical Co. ' s plant has been hacked to pieces and hauled away . What ' s left is a rolling , 45-acre lot of clay on a point in the Pine River , land that is to be sealed and labeled " Toxic Chemical Burial Area . " An 8-foot chain-link fence keeps townspeople out . Michigan Chemical ' s corporate identity has disappeared into Velsicol Chemical Corp. , which owned the St. Louis company for years before disaster struck . Disaster began as a mix-up , about 10 years ago , in bags of a cattle-feed supplement and a flame-retardant that Michigan Chemical made on the now-vacant lot . It continued with the dumping of tons of toxic chemicals in a county landfill near the site . And it eventually set off the biggest chemical contamination episode in American history in terms of number of people affected , the amount of land contaminated and the remedial funds required . Today the episode is especially significant because the US Environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims against Velsicol - without court action , acknowledgment of wrongdoing , or provision for current or future impact on the people and communities most affected . No local representatives were invited to participate in the negotiations . The EPA ' s administrator , Anne M. Gorsuch , has announced that such negotiated settlements will be a centerpiece of the Reagan Administration ' s policy regarding major chemical waste sites around the country . The EPA identified more than 400 such sites around the country last month including 38 in New England . What happened in Michigan nearly a decade ago was the hypothetical , opening nightmare of Rachel Carson ' s " Silent Spring " come to life . Firemaster , the flame-retardant , was fed to cattle and chickens whose milk and flesh and eggs all went to market laced with the highly toxic fire retardant . The contamination never drew the kind of attention Love Canal got , partlybecause of repeated assurances to residents by state and federal officials . Even after the accident became a matter of overriding concern within the state , virtually the only news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dairy cows tainted with chemicals had been slaughtered and buried in pits , along with a million other animals . Uncounted others were sold at market . Few heard that large amounts of contaminated milk and meat were sold to the public for months after government agencies charged with monitoring foodstuffs and agriculture had evidence that widespread poisoning had occurred among the state ' s farm animals . Last April the American Medical Assn. reported that an estimated 97 percent of the residents of the state at the time of the contamination now carry the chemical in their bodies . The report ' s authors , noting that the chemical has been found to cause liver cancer in rats , concluded that the contamination will pose serious health concerns for years to come . In September , doctors at New York ' s Mt . Sinai Medical Center , who have been studying the chemical ' s effect on humans since late 1976 , released findings they said indicate that damage caused by the chemical may not be dose-related , as Michigan researchers continue to assume . Dr. J. George Bekesi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said any amount at all of the polybrominated biphenyl ( PBB ) , the basic chemical in the fire retardant , appears capable of interfering with the human body ' s immune system . And the researchers have found that the chemical produces disturbances of the nervous system , including memory loss and muscular weakness . Against that background , Velsicol recently negotiated a settlement of all claims by the EPA and the state against its late subsidiary , Michigan Chemical - a settlement the EPA touted as " worth $38.5 million . . . the largest ever reached in an environmental contamination case . " But company officials contacted recently did not stand behind that figure . " What was billed as a $38 million settlement was actually a $14 million settlement , " according to Richard F. Blewitt , Velsicol ' s vice president for corporate affairs . He said the state will get $13.5 million of the money for its general fund , and EPA will get $500,000 . The EPA calculated its figure , he explained , by estimating the value of the work already done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clay and disposal wells to be made available by the company to the state . The state work includes securing the 40-acre Gratiot County landfill , just outside St. Louis , where an estimated 80 tons of the chemical were dumped and which is the state ' s top-priority toxic- waste clean-up site . None of the money will go to St. Louis , a friendly , center-state town of 4100 whose citizens have suffered more than most Michiganders for mistakes that were not their own , and who were not represented in the settlement negotiations . People in the area don ' t like to talk about that or any other issue connected with the episode any more . They , like the chemical company executives , just want to put it all behind them . Two blocks from the old plant site , on Mill street in the heart of town , a tape-recorded song floats across ghostly , quiet streets : " There ' s no place like ho-oh-ome , there ' s no-oh place like home . . . " Not even the last shopping days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the more-prosperous years before , as many here put it , " the  - -   - -   hit the fan . " A one-industry town became a no-industry town ; about 500 jobs and nearly a third of the municipal tax base evaporated . Helen Hall , who lives here with her construction-worker husband and six children , runs the Antiques and Uniques store in the center of town . But her passion these days is her work with " The Spirit of St. Louis , " a residents ' group formed to accentuate the positive about the town . " I ' m more afraid of the dark " than of chemical residues , she said in an interview at the local Santa ' s Workshop . " It ' s a crying shame that our town takes the brunt of something like this . " How can she be so sure the townspeople have nothing to fear ? " The smoke and vapors went northeast , " she said , pointing in that direction . " You can see where it killed the trees and took the paint off people ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it just like I knew my son was going to make it when they said the chances weren ' t good . " Wayne Hall , her 22-year-old , got Hodgkins disease , a lymph cancer , a year ago and is undergoing chemotherapy . " I ' m not sure the ramifications are being addressed , " he said one morning before Christmas in his mother ' s store . " There have been quite a few cases of Hodgkins disease in this area in the last few years . I think it ' s funny - sort of suspicious . The doctors tell us they don ' t know why . All people can do is guess . " He is tall , thin , soft-spoken , and is growing a light brown beard . " I don ' t know what anybody can do about it , so people try to go on with their lives and forget about it , " he said . " You ' re kind of stuck . What can you do ? " The most anger and the least doubt about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former workers at the plant . " A lot of the parents complain their kids are sick all the time , " said Jim Buchanan , former president of the Oil , Chemical and Atomic Workers local . " Of course , " he added , " we can ' t prove it " to the degree required by scientists and courts . The state , he noted , " slaughtered the cattle that had 20 or 30 parts per billion " of the chemical in their bodies . I ' m right at the killing stage myself , and we ' ve got ( former workers* with 1200 , 1300 " parts per billion in their tissues . Ron Orwig , a former Michigan Chemical worker who now works for the state , had only seven parts per billion of the chemical in his body when he was tested . His 10-year-old son had more than twice that level . " We figure he was born at a time I would have had it on my shoes and clothes . I carried it home when he was crawling around on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about exposure to Firemaster is Tom Ostrander , who worked for years repairing machinery in the plant . He used to talk publicly about doctors finding 3600 parts per billion of contaminant in his body , about losing weight and energy , about how company doctors diagnosed him as having a " syndrome " traceable to the chemical . That , he adds , was before corporate and government officials declared that Firemaster had no provable effects on humans . Now Ostrander doesn ' t talk about it any more . Last year he accepted afinancial settlement from the company on the condition that he would no longer give interviews to newspapers . Inside the one-story , brick municipal building , where the public washroom is closed for lack of money to fix the plumbing , James E. Ayers , the part-time mayor , acknowledged with resignation : " We haven ' t been notified yet ( of the settlement* . They probably figure we ' re so goddamn dumb we won ' t notice . " Ayers , a former Dow Chemical employee , pushed back his whitening hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has pretty much been treated that way all along . " The city was not aware " that dangerous chemicals were being made at the plant site and dumped in a neighboring county landfill , Ayers said . " The state handed out the permits and . . . never told the city the permits were issued or what was being made until it all hit the fan . " Augustin DuPont , a dapper , 40-year-old man , was city manager of St. Louis for 4 1/2 years until he resigned last month . He said that when he took the job in 1978 , he didn ' t know the company would close permanently that fall , throwing the local government and economy into extreme distress . " We laid off 25 percent of the ( municipal* staff , " he recalled . " Everyone ' s water bill immediately rose 75 percent " because the company was no longer using the system . " There were two concerns , environmental and economic , and the economic had more immediate impact . " DuPont said he was surprised that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand involvement in the settlement and health issues . " The governor made some statements about trying to give economic aid to St. Louis and Gratiot County , " DuPont recalled . " Unfortunately , the only thing produced was a study by one of the agencies about how bad things were . " Local residents " were never part of the negotiations , and we got almost zero information from the state and federal authorities about what was happening to resolve this problem , " DuPont said . " They could have told us what was going on - it is in the middle of our community . " A town and city manager for 12 years before he decided to go into a real estate and insurance business , DuPont acknowledged : " We didn ' t scream and holler , we didn ' t run to the press . " Would he recommend that the town or its administrator follow that course again ? " We needed to know more , to be more involved . I ' d recommend that any community get its own expert assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s ridiculous for a town to have to do that , but I guess I ' m recommending it . " Would it have made a difference ? I don ' t know . If nothing else , maybe no one would be wondering now if they ( authorities* didn ' t care about us because we were complacent .
