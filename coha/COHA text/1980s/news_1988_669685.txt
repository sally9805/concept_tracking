Along the walls , at regular intervals between the parking spaces , are wash basins. // There ' s also something odd about the Lilla Bjorn ( Little Bear ) Child Care Center in a suburb of Stockholm. // Most of the rooms are open and sunny , but one at the center of the building has relatively tiny windows , set deep into walls that are more than a foot thick. // These kinds of architectural details are evident in countless buildings across Finland , Sweden , and other Scandinavian countries . They ' re subtle , and easily missed if you don ' t know what to look for. // // But they have a very specific purpose. // The parking garage and the day-care center are specially constructed to double as shelters from , among other things , chemical and biological weapons attacks. // Sweden , in particular , has gone an extraordinary step further in protecting its citizenry from wind-borne poisons . The government is well along in a plan to purchase and stockpile a gas mask or protective respirator for every man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people. // To that end , Swedish companies have perfected a range of protective devices unparalleled in the world . Among them : special respirators for children and infants. // Finland , on the other hand , has opted for collective rather than individual protection ; it has spaces for 2. 6 million people in shelters scattered across the country , each equipped with special air-filtration systems to trap every known chemical and biological warfare agent. // No other country even approaches these two nations when it comes to preparedness. // But other nations are noting the example . Civil defense officials from a number of countries , including China , have visited in the past year . They have toured the shelters , peered through the gas masks - and come away impressed. // The interest has been a boon to some of the companies that make the specialized protection equipment. // ' ' It ' s been like this abroad , ' ' says Rolf Palmaeus , moving his hand in a steep upward arc to indicate the rising interest . Mr. Palmaeus is product manager for defense products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gas masks to the country ' s civil defense program. // He says there ' s no doubt it ' s because of the Iran-Iraq war , which saw the most extensive use of chemical weapons since World War I. // Sweden and Finland have their own reasons for taking civilian protection so seriously . Both are neutral nations . Both have openly declared that they possess no chemical or biological weapons , and therefore could not retaliate in kind if attacked with these substances . And they have a long tradition of emphasizing civil protection. // But the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union underscored the need for protecting against wind-borne poisons . That explosion , at a civilian nuclear reactor in the Soviet Ukraine , rained radioactive particles on vast stretches of Finnish and Swedish territory , causing millions of dollars in damage to agriculture in both countries . It also caused no small alarm among the unprotected civilian populace. // Finland ' s options // ' WE had to do a lot of rethinking after Chernobyl . . . we decided we had to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief inspector of the rescue department of Finland ' s Ministry of the Interior. // Although Finland ' s civil defense plans are centered on nuclear protection , Mr. Koivukoski says that in the process of drawing them up , ' ' We ' ve planned a lot for chemical warfare. ' ' // All of the nation ' s civil defense detachments have gas masks . But , as Koivukoski admits , that ' s only 40 , 000 to 50 , 000 people. // ' ' We are planning to get gas masks for every citizen in Finland , ' ' he says , ' ' but we don ' t have the money. ' ' // That rules out mass evacuations from contaminated areas . Instead , the Finnish planning is shifting emphasis to making sure there are shelters near where the people are. // In fact , any dwelling in Finland larger than 3 , 000 cubic meters must , by law , include a shelter in the basement . The national government reimburses builders or residents for the extra costs incurred to provide such shelters. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for anyone in a building without one . The national government budgets some 140 million Finnmarks annually ( about $30 million ) to build shelters large enough to serve entire neighborhoods. // All have activated-charcoal air filters and are equipped with overpressure devices that inhibit the inflow of contaminated air . All are kept ready for use 24 hours a day . And each shelter is fitted with an air lock at the entrance , and decontamination areas to rinse off any person coming from the outside. // In the capital city , Helsinki , 34 large shelters were blasted out of bedrock under the city . Theoretically , they would accommodate 90 percent of the city ' s population. // In fact , there are practical problems . The city ' s population swells during the day by 110 , 000 commuters , students , tourists , and businesspeople . And while some neighborhoods have a surplus of shelter space , others suffer from a deficit. // ' ' It will take , I would say , at least 20 years ' time ' ' to balance supply with demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief in Helsinki. // In peacetime , civil defense officials make the shelters available for other community activities. // The cavernous 9 , 000-person rock shelter in the suburb of Kontula is being used as a youth center . Young people repair autos , do woodworking , or fire ceramics ; there are squash courts and weight-lifting rooms below hundreds of feet of solid rock. // Shelters , Swedish-style // STOCKHOLM ' s Lilla Bjorn Child Care Center is another shelter doing double duty. // Though there are few obvious signs of its intended purpose , in the event of conflict , temporary partitions would be knocked down , exposing heavy steel doors . Vents would be sealed up ; air filters would be bolted to pre-wired and ducted walls ; and an emergency radio would be connected to an outside antenna. // Sweden has taken particular interest in the threat posed by chemical and biological agents in recent years , says Rune Dahlen , head of civilian protection at Sweden ' s National Rescue Services Board. // The reasons , Mr. Dahlen says , are the use of chemical weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other countries , and the growing use of toxic chemicals in Sweden ' s own chemical industry . In 1982 , the Swedish parliament decreed that every citizen have an emergency breathing apparatus in 10 years ' time . That goal will be missed by two years , but every child will have a device two years before the deadline , Dahlen says. // Already , 5. 6 million of 7. 2 million adult Swedes have gas masks , as do 160 , 000 of the nation ' s 330 , 000 children , and 10 , 000 of the 100 , 000 infants. // To meet the need , manufacturers had to come up with five sizes of masks. // Fitting growing , active children presented a particular problem . The solution was a protective cloak with a respirator in a coatlike overgarment . A special ' ' baby lift ' ' has been created for infants ; resembling a clear-plastic basinette , it has a zipper hood and a battery-powered gas filter. // These breathing devices are kept at special depots , and would be distributed in the event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the country ' s 600 rescue platoons to work in a chemically contaminated environment ; the rest are slated to undergo training. // Still , in the event of a chemical weapons attack , the contamination of facilities would be very difficult to manage , says Bjorn Ekengren , a civil engineer at the Rescue Services Board . <> <> Vulnerable spots // SWEDEN has also stockpiled certain vaccines in the event of a clandestine attack with biological weapons . But officials admit that a surprise attack involving biological or even the most elementary of chemical agents - mustard gas - might wreak havoc , especially if it occurred along with a conventional artillery attack . The country ' s medical facilities would simply be overwhelmed , and medical personnel might not know what kind of treatment to administer. // ' ' To be frank , ' ' says Dr. Karl-Axel Norberg , medical director of the emergency and disaster planning division of the National Board of Health and Welfare , ' ' we ' d have a problem dealing with burn patients , let alone this kind of ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fairly low. ' ' // ' ' We ' ve recognized the need , and we ' re working in the field , ' ' he says. // But money is an ever-present problem. // Health officials asked parliament for 330 million kronor yearly ( about $55 million ) for emergency civilian medical protection supplies , equipment , and training , says Jan Hjelmstedt , an official in the emergency and wartime planning division of the Health and Welfare Board . They got 220 million ( about $36 million ) . // ' ' Of course , I would have to say that isn ' t enough , ' ' Mr. Hjelmstedt says. // Still , research has found that even unlimited funds wouldn ' t provide all the answers. // ' ' If an aggressor uses these agents against a civilian population , ' ' Dr. Norberg says , ' ' that population can never be fully protected.
