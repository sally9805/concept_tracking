 | In August the phrase " dog days " takes on special meaning for moviegoers . The dogs of summer are those insufferably bad movies that are kept on the shelf until the studios figure that the brain-wilting heat has softened up film fans to the point where they ca n't tell Indiana Jones from New Jersey Jerk . Sitting through stuff this awful is an experience that turns entertainment into masochism and makes you a movie zombie , trapped in the dark , popcorn dribbling from your nerveless lips . These are not reviews but warnings . BEWARE THE DOGS : Cloak &; Dagger comes on like a rightthinking antidote to Steven Spielberg 's superspeed celebrations of kiddie violence . It even uses Henry Thomas , who was so affecting as E.T . ' s buddy in the Spielberg classic . But where " E.T . " celebrated its young hero 's imagination , " Cloak &; Dag- ger " makes the boring mistake of chastening it . This would n't be so bad if the kid 's prechastening adventures were exciting . But director Richard Franklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hitchcock , hops even more clods in this story of a Texas boy who lives in a world of video-game adventures inhabited by his dream-hero , Jack Flack . Flack is a soupedup version of the kid 's prosaic father ( both played by Dabney Coleman ) , who weans his son away from dreams of glory by explaining that real heroes " put supper on the table . " This movie is a weaner , not a winner . Laurence Olivier has been in more than his share of dogs in recent years , and The Jigsaw Man is one of the scruffiest of them . This must be the dullest spy flick ever made , with Olivier as the head of British intelligence and Michael Caine as a sort of triple agent who had defected to the KGB , which now sends him back to spy in Britain , where he defects from his defection . Or does he ? And who cares ? Terence Young seems to have made a bet that he can make more good actors look silly than any other director . He wins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Robert Powell not only stupefy with their ceaseless stiff-upper-lip jabber , but they all look flabby , hollow-eyed and scaly-skinned , as if they 're suffering from some strange malady . The dogs of summer have the mange . Another good cast is shredded to mindless pulp in Dreamscape . Dennis Quaid is a psychic who 's corralled by scientist Max von Sydow and his sexy sidekick , Kate Capshaw , into a research project that involves entering the dreams of disturbed people to exorcise their phantoms . Enter Christopher Plummer as an evil CIA type who wants to control dreams , including those of the president of the United States ( Eddie Albert ) , who 's been having guilty dreams about nuclear war . " It 's beginning to affect my job , " says Prez Eddie . It 's writing like this , plus special effects that seem to have been scavenged from George Lucas 's garbage cans , that turns " Dreamscape " into its own worst nightmare . Movies this bad make you wonder if somebody 's kidding . Spoofing a put-on of a takeoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jokes . In Sheena , director John Guillermin seems trapped between taking-off the Tarzan genre and taking off Tanya Roberts 's clothes . Fun is fun , but it 's sheer chutzpah these days to make a movie about a tribe of blacks who worship a golden-haired white goddess . Protecting her poor , helpless Zamboulis , Sheena runs up against a bad African prince who likes to give American highfives and a brave American TV producer who wants to take the golden goddess back with him to New York . " I 've got a great view of the World Trade Center from my loft , " he temptingly tells her . What this movie gives you is a great view of former Charlie 's Angel Roberts , a human Taj Mahal whose transcendent architecture is shot from every analytical angle . But why did n't they give her a real zebra to ride instead of an obviously tarted-up horse ? Maddest of all these dogs is John Milius 's Red Dawn . Milius , a self-styled " Zen fas- cist " whose latest movie was " Conan the Barbarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States by Soviet and Cuban forces that is cretinous not because of its theme but because of its sheer cosmic ineptitude . A bunch of high-school kids flee to the mountains , where they toughen themselves into guerrillas by doing what they have to do ? such as drinking deer 's blood and cooling a truck by urinating into its radiator . Milius 's dumb machismo explodes into rocket-screeching , grenadeblasting scenes of carnage . And his political sensibility is summed up when a U.S. pilot ( Powers Boothe ) explains why the superpowers went to war : " They 're the two toughest kids on the block . Sooner or later they 're gon na fight . " But Milius is no fascist ; he 's just muddle-headed : " Red Dawn " shows maudlin sympathy for a Cuban colonel who longs for his days as a guerrilla and is a dead ringer for Che Guevara . The film is too dumb to work as patriotic exhortation and too mawkish to work as blood-and-guts exploitation . It 's a long commercial in which the Marlboro Man has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns and a bottomless case of Coors. @# 73
