Plans for a French-backed force to replace the Libyans <P> The commander of Libya 's occupation forces in the central African nation of Chad received an urgent phone call from his government in Tripoli last week . When he hung up , he told reporters that he had received " an order " from Libya 's mercurial strongman , Colonel Muammar Gaddafi , to withdraw his troops from Chad . Added the clearly shaken soldier : " We must leave immediately ! " <P> This latest turn in Chad 's murky political fortunes was unexpected and , like so many events that have preceded it , open to many interpretations . But if Gaddafi does indeed pull out all his troops , it would clearly be a triumph for the diplomatic tactics of the Socialist government of France 's President Franois Mitterrand . <P> <P> The news that the Libyans were beginning to leave came as Mitterrand was acting as host to a meeting in Paris of more than 30 African leaders , including a dozen heads of state . Encouraged by Mitterrand , the conference unanimously endorsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a multinational African peacekeeping force to move into Chad and to help rebuild the country 's army . <P> Restoring peace to Chad will be a formidable task for Mitterrand and his African allies . A vast country , over twice the size of France but with a population of only 4.6 million , Chad has been torn by a civil war between the Muslims of the north and the black Christians of the south for the better part of two decades . That struggle ended , at least temporarily , in March 1979 , when Muslim guerrillas , armed by Gaddafi , finally succeeded in overthrowing President Felix Malloum , one of the two black Christians who had run the country since it gained its independence from France in 1960 . Muslim Leaders Goukouni Oueddei and Hissene Habr then shared power in an alliance of eleven factions with Oueddei serving as President and Habr as Defense Minister . <P> But fighting soon broke out between the armies of the Libyan-backed Oueddei and the French-backed Habr . The struggle continued off and on , killing thousands and ravaging the country 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaddafi dispatched to Chad a contingent of 4,000 troops , complete with tanks , rocket launchers , mortars , helicopters and MiG-25 fighters , to support Oueddei . Habr quickly agreed to a cease-fire and fled . Gaddafi , who dreams of creating a sub-Saharan Islamic republic from Senegal on the Atlantic to the Sudan on the Red Sea , announced a month later that Libya would " merge " with its southern neighbor . <P> The declaration appalled most African governments in the area , as well as the French . Habr and his little army took refuge in the border area between Chad and the Sudan and began to launch periodic raids . What was not realized at the time was that Gaddafi 's announcement also alarmed Chad 's President Oueddei , who sought a way of escaping Libya 's smothering embrace . He supported a proposal of the 50-nation Organization of African Unity to provide troops that could replace the Libyans , whose numbers by last month had reached an estimated 10,000 . Nigeria and Senegal were willing , but nothing came of the plan .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
