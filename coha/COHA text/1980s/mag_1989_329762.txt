When teachers strike in most communities , parents have little recourse . Not so in Beverly Hills ( per capita income : $33,839 ) . Last week parents ended a two- week walkout by passing the top hat . In a mere 48 hours , they chipped in $500,000 to help bridge the gap between the teachers ' demand for a two-year 18% pay hike and the school board 's 11% offer . Beverly Hills teachers , long the highest paid in the state ( average salary : $42,659 ) , had been seething since Los Angeles teachers overtook them by winning a 24% pay increase last May . They grudgingly accepted a settlement of 12% to 15% . The parents ' donations will be distributed as a one-time bonus , followed by a permanent raise if an increase in property taxes passes next year . Some school officials had qualms about the buyout . Said school board President Dana Tomarken : " I am concerned about the message it sends to other , less fortunate communities . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
