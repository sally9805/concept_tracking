Thousands of Haitians are being held in detention camps in this country . They pose a tragic question to an America that feels crowded by illegal immigrants . A month ago the Haitians sent an open letter to the American people , describing their plight and saying " we can not stand it any more ... If we have not been freed by the end of November , a good number of us are going to commit suicide . Because we have sworn to die in the United States . " There were no Haitian suicides in December , but by Christmas hundreds had started a hunger strike saying they were willing to die unless freed . The confrontation embodies an American demographic dilemma , between numbers and identity . American fertility is at an historic low , about 14 percent below generational replacement . More are born than die in this country for the moment only because the baby-boom generation is so large and at its most fertile age ; unless something changes , deaths will overtake births in about 20 years , as has already happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . Meanwhile , our immigration , legal and illegal , is as large as ever in our history , a million people per year . Its racial mix is , by the convention of American culture , overwhelmingly colored : mulatto , mestizo , Asian ; its dominant language is Spanish . Thus immigration is likely to determine not only our total population but what kinds of people we are . There has been some ill-formed debate about this . Some see this immigration as the product of unrestrained fertility in the poor countries , and preach a lifeboat ethics of keeping out such improvidents . Contrariwise , a few say that innovation and productivity will be spurred by population growth . Some are torn between their instinct for the huddled masses and their worries about overpopulation . Some have an ideological sympathy for non- intervention , but feel strongly about the ethnic composition of this country and about English as our national language . Others hold that immigrants come because they are recruited by American business as cheap labor . America ' s policy should serve American interests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of our numbers , but of who we are . Here are some conceptual and moral difficulties : - Immigration laws give preference to spouses , children and parents of legal residents , implying that relatives of residents are part of " us. " - By contrast , our Asian wars left behind many children of Asian mothers and GI fathers . These children are scorned and abused where they now livebecause they are different . They are not part of their native countries . Are they part of " us " ? Our general policy is to deny them entrance to this country ; is that right ? - There is a large but unknown number of illegal residents in this country , and any rational policy must deal with that . They can not all be rounded up and sent home ; nor can we afford to have millions living among us outside the law . We must normalize the status of most of them in some way . But when that is done , those new residents will have the right to bring in their spouses , children and parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This second wave of immigration would be larger than the first . Those who have lived among us for years are part of " us " - are their relatives ? - We are also defining identity on a different dimension : several bills in Congress and a proposed constitutional amendment would give a fetus the status of a person . Would then the fetus of a Mexican woman living illegally in this country be a citizen ? Would it matter whether the conception occurred in Mexico or in the United States ? Would it make a difference if the father were a legal resident ? Is that fetus part of " us " ? Two main types of immigration are upon us . First , we are a rich country neighboring poor countries , and our frontiers are and will remain porous . Second , we are a super power in a world whose geopolitical structure will occasionally crack , giving us small inflows of deposed elites or massive onesfrom escaping populations . Our policy is to accept political refugees . This reassures our client populations abroad and strengthens their loyalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polish ambassadors , Sakharov ' s daughter- in-law , assorted Iranians , Libyans , deposed Latin American strongmen and many others . But we do not accept economic refugees , although it is hard to tell where political discrimination ends and economic hardship begins . We accept adopted babies from Mexico and Colombia , who clearly are economic immigrants recruited by Americans . Why do we take them in and deny the Haitians ? The Haitians sense our dilemma . Their letter makes morally valid but legally weak claims for asylum on racial , religious or political grounds . But its strength lies in its artless claims to a common identity with the American people . The Haitians say " we are Christians , " and " haven ' t you thought we were humans , that we had a heart to suffer with and a soul that could be wounded ? " They are trying to say that they are part of us : first because they are Christians , then because they are human . They ask : " Why do you treat us this way ? Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them lump it ; a compassionate one says give them haven . Tough or tender , what do we do with the Haitians and their threat of suicide ? They are black and speak French ; if they spoke English , efforts on their behalf by black and civil-rights groups might be more ardent . Were they not poor , or the victims of a rightist dictatorship , their welcome might be different . But they are poor , black and French-speaking , not much part of us . And so , with half- averted face , we hold them off , intercepting them at sea , putting them in holding camps , returning them home . We say they are not part of us , not our responsibility , because to say otherwise would open the floodgates to other millions of foreign poor . The Haitians , in turn , try their weak claims on our common identity . It is curious that , in the end , if some Haitians commit suicide , it will not be their plight , their color , their Christianity , or their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have kept them from living among us , but if the bell tolls , we can not deny their being among our dead .
