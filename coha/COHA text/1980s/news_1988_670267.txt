May Department Stores Co. agreed to sell its Loehmann ' s chain of discount women ' s clothing stores to an investor group led by a Spanish concern and a division of Donaldson , Lufkin &; Jenrette Securities Corp . The move may signal that a restructuring is under way at the last big department store operator that is considered vulnerable to a hostile takeover . St. Louis-based May , notoriously tight-lipped , wouldn ' t comment about whether it plans other divestitures . But Robert F. Buchanan , an analyst at A.G. Edwards &; Sons Inc. in St. Louis , characterized the Loehmann ' s agreement as " a further indication that May ' s management is trying to maximize shareholder value and get the stock price up " to make the company less vulnerable to a takeover . In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , May closed Friday at $36 a share , up $2. 875 . Mr. Buchanan believes a potential buyer might pay $48 a share or more for May . " You ' re going to see May sell a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Buchanan . Added Thomas Tashjian , an analyst at Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles : " I would expect some of the smaller divisions to either be sold or consolidated " with larger May divisions . Last month , May sold its small May Cohens division in Jacksonville , Fla. , to Goudchaux/Maison Blanche Inc. , a Baton Rouge , La. - based department store operator , for an amount that wasn ' t disclosed . May also has been quietly closing stores that don ' t meet its standards for productivity . As previously reported , real estate industry sources said May is also working with Morgan Stanley &; Co. to auction off a share of its interests in 29 regional shopping malls . And May is rumored to be interested in selling its Venture discount chain . May said only that it agreed in principle to sell its 77-store Loehmann ' s division to an investor group led by Sefinco Ltd. , an affiliate of Madrid-based Entrecanales y Tavora S.A. , and the Sprout Group venture capital arm of Donaldson Lufkin . Entrecanales y Tavora is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclosed , but Mr. Buchanan of A.G. Edwards estimated that May might receive $170 million for Loehmann ' s . The division , with sales of $334 million in the latest fiscal year , is small by May ' s standards and doesn ' t fit the company ' s main mission of running fashionable department stores . May acquired Loehmann ' s as part of its 1986 merger with Associated Dry Goods Corp . Since then , several chains have changed hands , including Federated Department Stores Inc. , which was acquired recently by Campeau Corp. in a heated battle . May itself bought two Federated divisions  --  Filene ' s and Foley ' s  --  from Campeau for $1. 5 billion in a transaction that improved its competitive position but is expected to dilute earnings in the second and third quarters . " They seem almost paranoid on the subject of someone taking them over , " an executive at another department store chain said of May ' s management . But , in seeking to remain independent , May executives aren ' t expected to ignore shareholders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pruning would fit well into that strategy , " said Mr. Tashjian of Seidler Amdec .
