Forgive George Shultz if he is eager to get home . After the Secretary of State flew to La Paz last week , suspected drug lords detonated a bomb as his motorcade drove into the Bolivian capital . The dynamite blast missed Shultz 's armored Cadillac but shattered the windows of several cars , including the one carrying his wife Helena . Unintimidated , Shultz delivered a speech that praised the government 's new anticocaine measures . <P> Shultz proceeded to Quito , Ecuador , to attend the inauguration of incoming President Rodrigo Borja . But there he found that left-wing politicians had installed a blatantly anti-U.S . mural in the meeting hall of the Ecuadorian Congress , where the swearing-in ceremony was to take place . Among the mural 's features : a skull wearing a Nazi-like helmet emblazoned with the initials CIA . Shultz showed up anyway . " As to the insult to the United States , " he said , getting in the last word , " I do n't appreciate it . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
