When 44-year-old John Powell died at Cincinnati 's Drake Memorial Hospital last March , doctors were not surprised . Powell had suffered severe head injuries in a motorcycle accident and had been comatose for eight months . But an autopsy revealed that Powell had actually died from a lethal dose of cyanide received shortly before his death . After a brief investigation , Donald Harvey , a 35- year-old orderly at Drake , confessed to the killing . <P> At first Powell 's murder appeared to be an isolated incident . But soon afterward , several workers at Drake called local station WCPO-TV to say there had been an unusually high number of unexplained deaths on the wards where Harvey had worked . The station 's investigative report on the subject in June prompted a grand jury probe . The bodies of ten people were exhumed by the Hamilton County coroner , and traces of arsenic were discovered in several . Last week WCPO reported that Harvey admitted to police he killed 34 people : 23 patients at Drake , five at a local Veterans Administration hospital where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were described as elderly and ailing . His methods , according to the report , ranged from cyanide , arsenic , rat poison or cleaning fluid to suffocation with a plastic bag or pillow . Police have refused to comment on the case , pending completion of the grand jury investigation . <P> A quiet man , Harvey had been given generally good marks by his hospital supervisors for his caring attitude toward patients . He had , however , come under suspicion at the VA hospital in 1985 , when some tissue samples were stolen from the hospital 's labs . Harvey resigned , and was then hired as an orderly by Drake , which was not told of his troubles at the VA because of federal privacy laws . <P> Harvey faces only one murder charge so far , but several more are expected to be handed up this week . At his arraignment for Powell 's murder , Harvey pleaded innocent by reason of insanity . Since then , court-appointed psychologists have turned up no strong evidence of mental illness , and his lawyer says he will probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strike a deal with prosecutors that will spare Harvey the death penalty . " My son has always been a good boy , " Harvey 's mother Goldie Harvey McKinney told the Cincinnati Post . " He 's still a good boy . He 's just sick , terribly sick . And he needs a good doctor .
