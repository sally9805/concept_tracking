last September , to tell her that she 'd better not take the stand . " Elfrida said , " Yes , I think I heard that before . " As she lowered her eyes , Corde dropped the subject . Elfrida then said , " I can see why she wants those people sent to jail . It 's perfectly natural . She must feel she owes it to her husband . " " Grady says it 's stupid of Max to push so hard , because if she were to break down in front of the jury it would do his case no good . I almost think Grady is hoping for it . But somehow she 's toughing it out . I never thought she could . " " Sorokin 's opinion is that Max is making a good defense , purely on the legal side .

Nobody would notice how stupid or how cracked he was . But since he ca n't even pay his bills , he has to find a way to dress his disaster presentably . But this has to be done in public . " " I get what you 're saying , " said Elfrida . Her uneasiness was deep . She was herself ultra-rich , for one thing . Her moved and distracted brother might at any moment fall into one of his theorizingfits . He saw how it was . He would take off from his elevation , from his butte , in a mad flight of clarity  --  and heresy . His voice would be equable , deep , harmonious , not a sign of fanaticism , and he would say incomprehensible , ungraspable , glassy , slippery and , finally , terrible , harmful things  --  things that would have revolted their father and made the late Zaehner look grim . In Elfrida 's opinion Albert did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . But then his love for her also had an exaggerated character . If she was glad to have his love , why did she rule out his " exaggerated " theories ? There was a certain amusement in his question . And then  --  honestly , now !  --  was it such a distorted theory ? He was saying that you became an im/pregnable monster if you had money , so that if to begin with you felt yourself to be monstrous you could build impregnability by making a fortune . Because then you were a force of nature , although a psychopath . Or if you were without any persona , then you bought a persona . And underlying all of this  --  Corde had had to fly to Communist Europe and sit in his wife 's schoolgirl room to understand it  --  underlying the whole of his recent phase of eccentricity ( it was n't at all eccentric from within ) was his continuingdispute with Elfrida 's husband , the late Zaehner . Contra Zaehner might have been the true title of those articles on Chicago . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first conception was innocent . Originally period pieces , picturesque , charming , nostalgic , his essays somehow got out of hand . Naturally , he could not expect sympathy from his sister . She could n't sympathize without disloyalty to Zaehner and to her son . Besides , she disagreed . " Do n't you worry , Elfrida , " he had said to her before he left  --  meaning that he would not molest her , would not try to get her to talk his way . She drew a long , thankful breath , and in her relief she said to him , " I think you ought to know , Albert , that Sorokin thinks you were right about Rufus Ridpath . Ridpath really did do his best at the County Jail . He was the only one who even tried to improve conditions and help the prisoners . And there were people who might have been out to get him . Sorokin agrees that he was basicallyhonest . They not only ganged up to get rid of him but made sure that he had no future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think Ridpath would ever have run for office , that would be out of character . But did Sorokin tell you this ? He was the one who sent me to Ridpath in the first place . " Elfrida made one of her faces . Corde understood exactly what it meant . She said , " You did n't have to go overboard and say that he was such a rare type of black man . " " That was n't what I wrote . I said he was a rare type in any color . Black or white or ocher or green , there were n't many people in Chicago who bothered their minds with anything like justice . Puzzling , how few . You did n't even realize this until you met ap102person who did have it on his mind as a primary interest , and then it dawned on you how rare such a primary interest was .... " " The phrase you used was ' a moral life . ' " " That was unfortunate . You 've got to be careful about the big word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong way . This kind of abnormal , professorial Plato-and-Aristotle stuff is the kiss of death . I probably did n't do Ridpath much good , either . Definitely a mistake .... " In the adjoining room , Minna was on the telephone . He had heard the ringing and now he became aware ( he did n't often tune in ) that this was an unusual call . Her voice went up sharply . He listened , and then went around through the corridor to the dining room . The Stambouli-work sofa was near the glass connecting door . He sat bent over , superattentive . The conversation was short . Minna tried to speak but the other party cut her off . Somethingbad was happening , that was certain . As soon as she rang off , she set out to find Corde . He heard her steps as she moved in the wrong direction , and called out , " Here . " She could n't answer when he asked what it was about , she only stared at him . " That was n't intensive care ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been that sort of news , and it was n't that sort of shock . Unlike Elfrida , Minna had no repertoire of faces . He had never seen her eyes so black or her skin so lined , so dry and white . " Well , what was that ? " he said . " Albert , do you know who ? It was the Colonel . " " Himself , in person ? " " It was the Colonel . I could murder him . " " What 's he done ? What did he say ? " " The Ambassador must have gone to work as soon as you left . "  | " I see . He called the Minister of Health , and the Minister called the Colonel ? ... " " That 's the way it must have been done . " " Well , all right , but what happened ? Does the Minister of Health run the hospitals or does n't he ? " " Not this hospital . The Colonel is in charge . He just told me inno uncertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albert ! " " I see . It 's a power contest  --  a minister versus the secret police . " " It was no contest . He 's the boss . " " That 's becoming clear . I 'm sorry , Minna . We should n't have tried to go over his head if we could n't go high enough . The usual mistake , doing the thing by halves . Should have realized ... a secretpolice colonel does n't give a damn for a cabinet minister . I think this is why our old friend Petrescu keeps dropping from sight . He gave it a try but he was outranked , and now he stays away . It was the second visit , the one we did n't have permission for , that licked him . I should n't have fooled around with the Ambassador . I should have tried to get to the White House on it . A direct call , President to President . It might have been pulled off . Still might . These guys have a favored nation agreement with the U.S. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't have refused . " " He said ... " " Yes , what did the Colonel tell you ? " " That I could see my mother one more time . Only once . That was what he said . " " Oh ? " said Corde , as if he understood . He did n't understand at all . He had a sharp pang of eyestrain . " Give me that again : he said come and visit her ? " " Once , he said . " " And when ? " " He 's going to leave that to me . I could n't believe it . I tried to talk , but he cut me off . He said , ' Do n't you understand Rumanian ? I 'm allowing you and your husband one visit . ' " Corde by now had taken this in . Come , once , and visit  --  it was the final visit . He said to Minna , " We started a fight with thep104Minister , and the Colonel won . I guess he took the dispute upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this more thought when the Ambassador offered . It was decent of him , but the usual result . You think you 're priming the decency pump by pouring decency . It 's never real .... Did he say , ' You and your husband ' ? " " Yes , Albert . What will I tell him ? I 'm supposed to call back and say when we 're coming . " " What about Tanti Gigi ? " said Corde . " If this is the one and only visit ? . . . No , you ca n't talk to him about Gigi . " " Albert , answer me : When shall we go ? Tomorrow ? When ? " " I 'd go today  --  tonight , " he said , rising from the settee . " Are you saying she may die anytime ? " " Tomorrow we may think of more strings to pull . Maybe Gherea can move her . Maybe we can stir up somebody at the White House . We might wire Washington . " " He 's waiting for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She went back to the telephone . Corde fetched his coat over his shoulders . These were the shortestdays . The afternoon light no sooner came in than it was on its way out . It was cold , too . Brittle scales began to show on the street puddles , a crystalline bitterness setting in . Where the light withdrew , the yellow-brown of the stucco was pocked with mild blue . ( They could rub your face into that stucco if they liked . ) On the open porches over the way  --  bottles , wet rags hung out to dry frozen at the points , and vine twigs . The glory of the day carried things easily when the sun shone ; but when the sun passed , things seemed abandoned , they became dissociated , and you had to find a way to take them up yourself . Corde followed his wife 's voice in the next room . Some languages are spoken , others sung . Even now , fighting the Colonel and the Communist state , she still sounded musical . As he  --  while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figuring why the Colonel had made such a decision ; and what kind of ploys there had been ; or what kind of deal the Colonel had cut with the Minister  --  still followed thought themes of his own . There was the Colonel in his tall broom-closetp105office , ruling on this , ruling on that , under a twenty-watt light . And there was personal humanity , a fringe receding before the worldwide process of consolidation . This process might seem too crude to be taken seriously , but do n't kid yourself , it was shaping the future . And while this shaping went on , the inmost essence of the human being must be making its own , its necessary , its unique arrangements as it best could . Now to move to Valeria and the life-support machines . Corde was convinced that the old woman was fully and probably even brilliantly conscious . The life supports were clicking and her mind was ( he decided ) exquisitely vivid  --  in a state of hypervividness . She would n't die until she had seen her daughter  --  seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't open her eyes . They made scanning movements under the skin ; they might be light-sensitive ; they filled out the lids ( an involuntary comparison ) like ravioli . She was studying her death , that was for sure . Corde thought of her with extraordinary respect . Her personal humanity came from the old sources . Corde had become better informed about these sources in Paris and London . Amid eye pangs that made him pass his fingertips over his forehead from left to right ( here in Eastern Europe he felt dehydrated and even conceived of his optic nerves as dry and frayed ) , he considered those old sources . He remembered that she had taken a serious interest in Structuralism , in Laing 's psychiatry . Hell , what did she want to bother for ? It must have been alien to her deeper life . In the deeper life she was traditional , even archaic . She had loved her husband , that was why she became a Communist militant : she had loved her husband , loved her daughter , her sister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marxism , for the sin of helping to bring in the new regime , by a private system of atonement , setting up her mutual-aid female network . Yet she kept up with sophisticated opinion ; the Party had denounced her when she was expelled for " cosmopolitan psychologism , " " or Freudianism , but that was nothing . She was reading a book on the Hagia Sophia . It was on her desk . Corde was curious about it , but the language was beyond him . This same Valeria , when she visited her husband 's grave , and her own burial place , lighted candles in front of the grave/stone  --  there was a big granite stone out there . Gigi said , " When she had to make an important decision , she went to the grave to talk to him about it . " She brought food for the beggars in the cemetery . It was n't only the mother-of-pearl inlay that was Stambouli-work . These were the Balkans . Here the deeper life was Byzantine , and even more archaic , never mind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nervous public . There was no such sophistication here . She stood before the gates of death . And as a physician  --  but you did n't need to be a physician to know that you were dying . She even suspected perhaps that the authorities might decide to disconnect the life supports when they had had enough of her . Corde definitely thought that the Colonel might have this in mind . He had the authority , definitely . He could say , " Pull ' ern , " and that would be that . And at this , Corde ( himself not so young , not so well ) felt a curious affinity for the crystals of brittle ice whose glitter came up to his Balkan window . These badgering perplexities , intricacies of equilibrium , sick hopes , riddling evils , sadistic calculations  --  you might do worse than to return to that strict zero-blue and simple ice . In all this Corde felt singularly close to the old woman . Minna when she came back said , " It 's settled for tonight . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place was bugged by pointing to the light fixture . " Let 's walk around the block . " " When is the car coming for you ? " " Not just yet . " There were twenty minutes to spare . Spangler 's driver was sure to be punctual . Drivers here , as elsewhere in Eastern Europe , reported to the secret police . For this reason they gave excellent service . Corde and Minna descended together in the small elevator . He held the heavy wrought-iron-and-glass door for her as she stepped into the street . Towards midafternoon , the December sun was ready to check out . Below the winter beams there were violet shadows ; these were collected in the pitted surfaces of the stucco walls , and made Corde think of choppy winter water . A similarp107color gathered about the pollarded trees . The pigeons afoot on the sidewalk had it , too , with iridescent variations . In midstreet Corde noticed the remains of small rats . They must have run for it duringthe earthquake , got themselves conked by falling masonry and then rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figuredthem . They were as two-dimensional as weather vanes . Here and there amid the Balkan Haussmann blocks were earthquake ruins or tumuli , and Corde assumed that they must also be graves . The brick heaps exhaled decay . There were unrecoverable bodies underneath . The smell was cold , dank and bad . Coupled rusty-orange tramcars ran with a slither of cables . Pale proletarian passengers looked out . They wore caps , the women kerchiefs . Togetherwith cast-iron sinks and croaking pull-chain toilets , these tramcars belonged to the old days . It was all like looking backwards . You saw the decades in reverse . Even the emotions belonged to an earlier time . The issue of the struggle with the Colonelwas human sentiment  --  not accepted as an issue under the new order . But the Colonel tacitly admitted it because it gave pain . He knew it was an issue . It was Corde 's momentary fantasy that these ideas were gathered about his head , as the light gathered , paler , around the pruned trees , each one of which resembled a bouquet . Minna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to quicken her pace . She had her own notions of feminine poise , or the appropriate Raresh dignity . But today she moved quickly . She held Corde 's arm , and when pedestrians approached , she gave it a tug which meant " shut up . " So he was silent , and she looked sternly absentminded . Minna never came to the dinner table , or got into bed at night , or went into the street , without putting on fresh lipstick . But now her lip was drawn thin and the red was hardly visible . She was dry , pale ; she looked very sick . " You understand what the problem is , Albert , " she said . " Gigi . " " Yes , Tanti Gigi , and how we get her in . " " Of course , " said Corde . " She has to see her sister . If there are passes for two at the gate , she can take my place . "  | " No , all three of us have to get in . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Petrescu . He 's always been a good friend . You can be sure this is painful for him . " " We 'll think about him some other time . He 's in another strange branch of experience . We 'll go into that later . Right now we have to make a plan . " " The first move is to get cigarettes . We 'd better have plenty of them . " " Those I can buy at the Intercontinental valuta shop . King-sized Kents . " " Yes . " They were walking through the reduced light and passed a triangular fenced park , palings leaning inward and green benchescovered with frost . " There 's my old school , " she said . " And down that street lived families of boyars . " Graceful buildings of the old regime were cut up into flats . In the dark shops where cans of peas and sauerkraut were stacked , you could see no customers . This was a once fashionable neighborhood . No more . The high apparatchiks had their villas elsewhere . " How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't phone for a cab ? " he said . " You can phone , but you ca n't count on anything . " " Gigi says that Ioanna has a nephew who 's a driver . You ought to talk to her about him . " " Yes ; Traian is his name . " " I think you 'd better try this Traian . " " I 'll ask Ioanna , " said Minna . " Does he own an automobile ? " " I 'll go into it right away . " " You can talk to Ioanna ? I mean talk . " " Yes and no . Yes , if you approach it right . She has to be treated like a relation . You do n't mention money , but you have to give it to her by and by . " " Hire Traian to drive us . Do you remember the man ? " " Twenty years ago he was n't a man . He was a fat boy , and he was n't pleasant . " " Well , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By seven . "  | " Once we 're in the car  --  and I 'll get a couple of cartons of Kents  --  you can explain what has to be done . They 've got to be on the take here . Ca n't live on wages . " They turned the corner , and Minna said , " I think your friend 's car is coming down the street . " " I should be standing by , " said Corde . " I can change the ap-pointment . " " No ; you go for the cigarettes , and see your friend . There is n't anything you can do here . I 'll go and talk to Ioanna . " She entered the building . Corde , his upper body braced against the cold , waited for the car . Three o'clock , and dusk already , tragic boredom coming with it . The forms of winter trees , the beauty of winter colors , were excepted from this . The trees made their tree gestures , but human beings were faced by the organized preventionof everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver came around and opened the door , let him into the warmth of the back seat . The privileged ride was short . Here was the American embassy again , the street cordoned off , sentries outside . And here was the Intercontinental . The lobby was luxurious . You could sink deep into those long sofas  --  any of them ; they were all unoccupied . The atmosphere was that of a mystery novel . From the restaurant came a smell of Turkish coffee . You realized that the Bosporus was just up the line , and that the Orient Express used to steam in here , with Mata Hari in the dining car and Levantine businessmen who were tripleagents . In the opulent lobby there were two hard corners of totalitarian organization  --  a plywood booth where currencies were cashed and a newsstand which sold foreign newspapers . East Germanmagazines hung from a wire by clips , and also Pravda and 1'Humanite . The valuta shop was on the second floor . Christmas was two days off . A little tree was surrounded by and powdered with cottonbatting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sheepskins , shelves with table linens and dolls in folk costume , carved wooden flasks , cameras , imported brandy . Among the shoppers were students from Africa . One of them , seeing Corde 's passport in his hand , said to him in a crackling British accent ,  | " The clarks here are insolent . They say any damned thing . They think we do n't understand their damned language . " The blacksmockedwomen were sullen and tired , rushed . Corde thought himself lucky . The girl who sold him the Kents was smiling at him  --  peculiarly : as if she were about to puff at a dandelion to see what time it was . Nevertheless , it was a sort of smile . She slipped his cigarettes  --  two cartons of the king-sized  --  into a Christmas bag with plastic handles . Was he in a mood for reunion with a high school friend ? He felt as though he had been knocked over in the street by a motorcycle , bruised , taped around the chest . What he wanted was to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull off the adhesive bandages . But there were no bandages . He edged into the crowded restaurant and bar to find Dewey Spangler . Impatient , feeling hampered , feeling bruised , he seemed all right , only a little serious ( nothing more than a dark mood ) . He looked about for Spangler . The meeting , the old-pal routine , would have to be brief . If Ioanna'snephew was unavailable , other arrangements would have to be made . Minna and Gigi needed him at home  --  his supportive presence , his suggestions . And the Kents , too ; the Kents most of all , perhaps . The packed bar intensified his caged mood ( let me out of here ! ) . Then he saw Spangler , who had risen in his booth and was beckoning with both arms , like an airlines employee signalinga plane to its gate . Spangler 's gestures had always been inappropriate , erratic . Unexpectedly , this was endearing . Bossy , fussing little bastard , in spite of his world eminence he was still Screwy Dewey , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought a two-hundred-pound Cubs fan in the Wrigley Field bleachers , hitting him with a book of poems . Spangler had been a frightful kid , but Corde had loved him . " Here , Albert , here , " Dewey called . What was it that made this meeting so rich ? Thrilling as hell , was n't it ? Spangler came to Chicago at least ten times a year , a hundred times in the last decade , and he never called Corde . But neither had Corde ever sent him a note to say , " I liked your column of last Wednesday . " He liked few or none of the columns . Dewey inp111the papers never surprised him . Start a Dewey sentence and Corde , with his eyes closed , could finish it for you . The system seldom varied . But in this exotic cafe , all reservations , judgments , slights and offenses were set aside . Here Spangler could measure the distance he ( or both of them ) had come . He put an arm about Corde . " Rah , rah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown compact . He was fleshy now and dignified by his well-groomed beard . The fat that had gathered in layers under his chin was disciplined , not slovenly , fat . These layers absorbed and even dignified his ducking mannerism , gave it affirmative weight , positive gravity . But he still had that one nervous habit . Although long years of psychoanalysis actually seemed to have helped him . Spangler had been recycled on the couch . He made no secret of it ; on the contrary , he frequently mentioned analysis in his column : he liked to reflect on the sense of human worth it gave him , the distinct contribution it had made to his appreciation of the Judeo-Christian value system . " Wass willst du haben ? " he said . " You remember that ? " " Yes , indeed . Louie and the Hungry Five , the comic German brass band from Old Heidelberg on Randolph Street , near the Oriental , " said Corde . " Right on . " Come to think of it , what could this meeting give Dewey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years avoided Corde . Corde embarrassed him : he knew his background , remembered his father and his mother , the Spangler household , its kitchen life , the leonine formation of Mrs. Spangler 's face , the flimsy silk bells of her stockings , the thigh portion falling below the gartered knee . They were touching people , especially the father . Old Spangler was bald and ruddy but did not enjoy good health . " In the notions business , " he said . But what notions were there late in the Depression ? You went down to the wholesale outlets at Twelfth Street and Newberry and took goods " on approval " to peddle door to door  --  sun visors , for instance , or table runners or combinations or cotton socks . It was the ill-concealed fact that " notions " meant peddling that embarrassed Dewey , and the embarrassment was compounded by grandiose and exuberant fantasies . He used to tellp112all kinds of stories about his origins . His father had been in a La Salle Street brokerage firm , he sometimes said , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Corde never gave him away . Why should he ? He actively sympathized with him . Still he had been distrusted . " The Heidelberg , " said Dewey . " Your formidable memory . " " I 'm glad to see you , pal . " Dewey wasted no time . " Albert , we were very close , were n't we , at fifteen and after ? " said Dewey . " A consuming association . When you told me  --  and I told you  --  damn near everything . And now look at us . Not many peas left in the pod , perhaps , but what of it , since we 've made something of ourselves ? Consider the origins .... " This was a hinted offer of candor . " I thought of you the other day when I came across a volume of Oscar Wilde in my mother-in-law 's flat . " " Mad for Swinburne and Walter Pater . Mad for Wilde . What stuff ! For , lo ! with a little rod did I but touch the honey of romance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can guess what that little rod was . But we did n't guess then , in our innocence . " " No , we loved poetry . " " Odd , in Chicago , where the South Branch of the river , you remember , was Bubble Creek because the blood and tripes and tallow , the stockyards ' shit , made it bubble in the summer . Doctorstalk about an alcoholic dying of an insult to the brain . Well , that stink could have done it . " " Is it Chicago we 're going to talk about ? " said Corde . " It is our native place , as you recently said in print . " The corpulence of his chin and throat , and perhaps also his worldly success , had made the down , down , downward pressure of his chin a movement of unshakable assertion . Like FDR 's blinking . FDR 's blink on Fox Movietone News meant : " Adversaries , beware . " Then Dewey went on ( it was predictable ) : " When you decided to go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p113You  were doing so well in Paris . " ( Was Spangler being patronizing ? There was just the hint of a put-down in " doing well . " He himself had become such a prodigy and hotshot . ) " But when I read the first of your pieces in Harper 's , I realized that you had scores to settle with the old town . " A waiter brought their drinks . Corde reclined in the booth , but his large hands were thrust deep into his trousers pockets , as far as to the wrists , a sure sign of tension . Dewey would not be taken in by his easy posture , or any of the old disguises . Dewey had the trick of making him an adolescent again . In adolescence Dewey had always had the upper hand . He had been precociously sharp . Corde rumbled , " Not the old town anymore . " " I suppose it is n't . But you were your old self in your approach . You were eloquent , you were superexpressive . Just the way you used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; you reallylet yourself go . I recognized lots of the old turns of phrase . Some of them still there . " " They probably are , " said Corde . " Made quite a stir , did n't you ? " Dewey 's eyes , pale blue , now set in puffed and wrinkled lids , mocked him . Not unkindly . He was on first-name terms with Kissingerand Helmut Schmidt . Millions read him . In his recent swing through Europe and Asia , he had interviewed Sadat , MargaretThatcher , Indira Gandhi . No reason to be mean with me , Corde was thinking , in the leisure of this personal nostalgic hour . Not so long as I admit his superiority . And I do admit it . Why should n't I ? Corde now decided to make an open concession and to bring this chapter in Spangler 's psychic history to a happy close . This syndicated columnist who was a sizable node in the relaying of the tensions that pulsated through the civilized world , made it tremble , saturated it with equivocation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , happened also to be an old friend . Yes , the same Dewey who at Lakeview had been so self-conscious about the size and shape of his ears that he would give them a nimble tuck under his cap when nop114one was looking , like an awkward girl ; who even tried to fasten them to his head with tape . The Dewey who had tried to grow a mustache to resemble William Powell  --  William Powell had obsessedhim . The pale vinegar worm he had been was now a punditand an arbiter , his columns anxiously , respectfully read in thirtycountries . But it was the original skinny , frantic , striving , screeching Dewey that Corde had liked so much . " You 've been looking at the time , Albert . " " Yes , I 'm sorry . I am uptight . There 's a lot of trouble here for us . " " So I 've been told by the Ambassador . A good fellow , the Ambassador . What 's going on ? " " My wife 's mother , dying ... " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Your wife ca n't see her . That 's too bad . It must work you up . As your own mother 's death did . I can remember that . " " I thought you might , " Corde said . " The Ambassador mentioned that he was calling somebody for you . " " So he did , but the result was negative  --  double negative . " " Is that so : counterproductive ? I wonder if I could put in a word . " " I assume you 're meeting the top people here . " " Yes , I am . I am , " said Spangler . He drew his chin inward swiftly , two , three , five times against the firm fat of his throat . " Then you might , if it 's convenient . It 's very late , though . " " Yes , Albert , I 'll try to find an opening . These people have a stake in good relations with Washington . Concerned about their commercial treaties .

" Rotund Spangler passed his hand over his Shavianbeard . It made a crisp sound . His hair was tight and vital ; Corde envied him that . " Is that too farfetched ? " " Whom have you got in Washington ? " " There 's you for starters , Dewey . " It was much too late for White House intervention . Corde was being wicked , testing old Dewey .

Yes , I think you love the woman . You 're just rum enough to do it . You always wanted to love a woman . It 's just when the whole world gives up on a thing that it turns you on . That 's you .

It gives me a chance to show how influential I 've become . " " Still there is a sort of payola or payoff system , is n't there ? " " The quid pro quo ? It 's not what people usually think . I 'd make it seem an opportunity for the President , not ask him for a favor . But let 's not make with the gratitude . " " You do n't need anything at all from me. "  | " I always liked you , Albert . I was a little scarecrow . You were my special friend . " " You had others . " " I was a joke to them . The way I carried on , my fantasieslies  --  andso on . You did n't twit me when you caught me in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy , " said Corde . " I had to have you . It was the Spinoza and the Walt Whitman . It was the William Blake . Nobody else was interested . Besides , I loved the way you would carry on . You were extravagant . You 'd holler and bawl at your poor mother , and call her a whore .... It gave me terrific pleasure . I never saw anything like it . You do n't mind this reminiscence , do you ? " " Not a whole lot . It 's true enough . And it 's just you and me in this booth . No use pretending , between us . Anyway , she 's been dead so long . " " She 'd lose her temper and say , ' You 're no kid of mine . You 're a criminal 's kid . They switched you on me in the hospital . ' Lovable moments . I was fascinated . Nobody else like your people around the Lakeview neighborhood . Also , you loved your old man . You 'd play checkers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bald head , and study the board through his pop-bottle lenses . And his shaky knuckles with the fur on them . He gave us his streetcar transfers so we could bum around the city . He was a dear , unlucky man ... . But I have to go , Dewey . I 've enjoyed this . Are you taking off soon ? " " Just after Christmas . Do n't run . The car will have you there in a few minutes . " " This is a terribly bad time for my wife . " Spangler said sympathetically but knowingly ( superknowingly  --  that had always been a specialty with him ) : " I can just imagine . For you , too . All kinds of hell in Chicago . I 'm damned if I can explain why you wrote those pieces . You might as well have stirred Bubble Creek with a ten-foot pole and forced the whole town to smell it . Then there 's the trial you 're mixed up in . The young man pushed from the window . "  | " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chicago papers . My assistant forwards the clippings . Your fat-ass cousin is going to town on you , too . He 's a bad actor . " " I thought you had changed your mind , and he was now okay by you . " " What are you talking about ? You were the one who was nice to him in the old days . I did n't want him around . It was you who listened to his bogus poetry . " " Well , we need n't make a contest of it . I did say once that with a slot in his head Max would make a terrific piggy bank . " " Oh ! Yes ; you did , did n't you . What a gift you always had for those crushing one-liners . At the same time you were in dead earnestmuch too often . Moralistic . I think it 's still there , too . Anyway , your cousin has a super hard-on for you . And what a performancehe 's giving . " " He gets plenty of help from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take . " " What young woman is that ? Oh , the girl , the young widow , you mean . " Dewey was not a good drinker . The double Chivas Regal made him talkative . He wanted a good long talk . He said , " What was this attack you made on the city ! " " I see no attack . I 'm attached to Chicago  --  I 'm speaking quite seriously . " " So am I serious , Albert . Are n't you aware of cutting loose with a lifetime of anger ? How strange , for an intelligent man . You should have had some psychoanalysis , Albert . You pooh-poohed me when I recommended it , but you needed it . The Institute is right on Michigan Boulevard and you would have had your choice of the very best . I was n't too good for it . With a little insight , you would n't be telling me now that you were attached . In Harper 's you crossed and offended just about everybody . You might have gotten away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boobus Americanus approach . Humor would have made a difference . But you lambasted them all . Really  --  you gave ' emp118hard cuts , straight across the muzzle . The obscurity of your languagemay have protected you somewhat  --  all the theorizing and the poetry . Lots of people must have been mystified and bogged down by it , and just gave up . All the better for you if they did n't read your message clearly . They 're all happy , of course , to see you get your lumps . Ill will for ill will . Harper 's came out of it okay , though . You were good for their circulation , which is pitiful at best . One of their guys in Washington was telling me you were doing yet another provocative piece on a different subject . " " With a man named Beech . But it is n't definite . I have n't decid-ed . " " What 's the field , biochemistry ? " " Geochemistry . " " Worse yet . What the hell do you , with your teeth cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to put in with the environmentalists ? That 's an extremely unattractive category of cranks . You 're cranky enough already . " " Beech is no crank . There 's a powerful scientific mind there . " " The best of them are diapered babies when they go public with a cause . Do you want me to name names ? . . . Becoming a professor was n't the right switch for you , Albert . You 've lost some of your realism . You went from active to passive . Now you 're tired of the passive and you 've gone hyperactive , and gotten distortedand all tied in knots . Wrong for you . So you 're a dean , and what next , boy ? " Dutch uncle had always been one of Dewey 's favorite roles . And actually Corde did n't much mind ; it was the old Dewey scolding away . It was agreeable because it was so characteristic . But Corde did n't have the time for it . He had to go . He downed his drink and collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where are you going ? I thought we 'd have a talk . " " I have n't got the time I expected to have , " said Corde . He began to edge out of the horseshoe booth with his sack of Kents . " I 've got to go to the hospital with my wife , to see her mother . " " Why , I thought you couldn't. "  | " They 've okayed one visit more . " " One ? A last ? They think she 's dying ? " " They must . She is . " Very thoughtfully , Spangler spread both his hands stiffly on the table . They were braced by his short arms , so that his shoulders were lifted . Grimacing , he said , " Terrible . Terrible on your wife . Very bad . Punitive . Somebody 's got it in for those ladies . I can understand why you 'd think of taking it to the White House . " " It 's too late . It was only a kind of fantasy , anyway . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember that you 're part of a proud superpower , and you say , ' I do n't have to put up with this . ' That 's baloney , of course . It 's from the good old days when an American abroad still got protection from his government . That went out with gunboat diplomacy . There 's also the Chicago approach : ' I must know somebody who knows some-body . ' " Somebody ? That 's me , for instance . I can still give it a try , if you like . I 'm not really effective now . In the Kissinger days it was different . These new guys ai n't much , Albert . You might as well talk to Bugs Bunny . " " There 's actually nothing that would help now . But it 's nice to see you , Dewey . I 'll settle for just that . A touch of the old warmth  --  I 'm grateful for it . " " Yes , this must be a hell of a place seen from inside . You 're in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But my impression riding around the city is that it 's got to be a miserable damn comfortless life , and scary as well as boring . I wish there were something I could do for your missus . It 's a shame she 's being pushed around . She 's a distinguished scientist . These guys have no class . Imagine what it takes to be in power here , the types the Kremlin prefers to appoint . Real dogs . But then "  --  recollection brightening Spangler 's face  --  " how does it go in King Lear ? ' A dog 's obeyed in office . ' Or else what we read in Zarathustra : ' Power stands on crooked legs . ' Nietzsche must have been thinking of dogs , too .... Are there still kids who do that , get together in Lincoln Park and read the wayp120we used to read  --  wallow in that glorious stuff : the Zarathustra , the Phaedrus , that Brigge book by Rilke ? " Gruff , but looking into Corde 's face with a steady smile , Spangler was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so influential . Spangler had put it behind him ; for some reason Corde had not . If Corde suffered , smarted in this Eastern bloc capital , it was because that glorious stuff made him vulnerable still , because he had failed to put it aside at the proper time . Was n't that why he became a professor , and why he fulminated in Harper 's ? It was n't the fault of the masterpieces . It was not knowingwhen to forget them that was the mistake . A grown man allowinghimself to regress ? At this moment when the nations , holding off destruction , were convulsed with tensions ; when a man needed hardness , patience , maturity , circumspection , , craft , real knowledge of diplomacy , economics , science , history ? Albert had lost his grip . Of course , it was understandable , regrettable . It was forgivable . All this shone out from Dewey 's bearded , understanding , patronizing , forgiving face . A mysterious metamorphosis had occurred and skinny Dewey had become a bearded dwarf . The tones that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed . He played on the same strings ; it was the bowing that was smoother . It was wonderful that the music , coming from the places where the deep tones lived , should still be what it had been forty years ago . He scoffed and he scolded , but now he did it with affection and endearment , soothing poor old nervous Albert . Albert returned his affection . But it was ungrateful in Dewey to depreciate the " glorious stuff . " Without the Zarathustra and the Lear , what would have become of him ? Would he ever have risen so high without the cultural capital he had accumulated in Lincoln Park ; would he even have gotten out of Chicago ? Dewey had never wasted anything in his life ; he alwaysgot his money 's worth . He had made the Shakespeare pay , just as he turned his years of psychoanalysis to use . His bookish adolescence had given him an edge over the guys at the City News Bureau and his competitors in Washington , so that now hep121could frame his columns in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget message to John Stuart Mill , transmuting the rattle of the Chicago streetcars into the dark rich tones of political philosophy . Even the idea of filling the shoes of Walter Lippmann ( a hell of a nasty ambition to suffer from , Corde thought ) went back to the scrolled green benches of Lincoln Park . Corde did n't mean to put Dewey down . But origins were origins . You did the best you could with them . You could n't turn them in for a better set . There was something more . What did Dewey have in mind , that he was being so endearing : did he want to resume their vanishedconnection ? Corde , holding his white plastic bag from the valuta shop , saw this possibility descending towards him from a past as remote as a former life on earth . It was , almost , a former life . Were these the boys who had mooched through Lincoln Park with poets and philosophers tucked under their sweaters ; who bought caramel corn in the zoo and lounged against the replica of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Phaedrus or with Rilke in Paris ? Since then each of them had died at least three or four times . So it was a former earth life . Corde 's feeling towards his friend was gentle but not particularly sentimental . Did Dewey still long for the old days of poetry and feeling ? So did Corde , at times . He reviewed the prospects for a revival of friendship with heartfelt objectivity . There was no question of rejecting Dewey . He 'd never do that . But how far he 'd admit him depended on his admissibility . They had diverged and diverged and diverged . Each of them had been spoilt , humanly , but in very different ways . Look at Dewey . Dewey grew up among warehouses , garages and taverns on Clark Street , not far from the site of the Valentine 's Day massacre , but now he was a great figure in his profession , ten times more important than any U.S. senator you could name . When he discussed plutonium sales to the Third World or Russian natural gas or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it with a flavor of art and high thought . He quoted Verlaine or Wittgenstein  --  in factp122he quoted them too much . But those Rilke readings had n't been wasted : the need for pure being , the fulfillment of the soul in art , Weltinnenraum . But then there was the other viewpoint , the La Salle Street one that you got from a man like Zaehner  --  it 's a jungleout there . ( Correction : a garbage dump ! ) Now , between these opposites , what ground had Dewey taken ? The great public , the consumer of his views , did n't require him to take any ground . He needed only to keep talking . He lived ( although Corde doubted that such tension should be called living ) in a kind of event-glamour , among the deepest developments of the times , communicatingwhat most concerned serious and responsible opinion . To Corde there was something bogus and grotesque about this . It was only " modern public consciousness . " There was no real experience in it , none whatever . The forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , " What would this wonderfulpalship of two old boys from Chicago look like if we brought it up to date ? " The answer was that it could only look like Dewey 's journalism . Dewey in his confident , comforting , but also peremptory way would tell him , " This is what we 've got . Lucky us , to have such a bond . " Their friendship revived , he would lay it all on you in his newspaper language , and strengthened by those Lincoln Park days , by books and poetry and friendship , by all that Corde had learned meantime , he might become an even more princely " communicator . " And now , with stormier objectivity , himself : How had Albert Corde been spoilt ? Well , Albert Corde had illusions comparable to Dewey 's , notwithstanding that they were in different fields . Look at him  --  an earnest , brooding , heart-struck , time-ravaged person ( or boob ) , with his moral desires and taking up the burdens of mankind . He was , more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to discuss with Dewey . There was , for instance , the reunion of spirit and nature ( divorced by science ) . Dewey ( Corde happened to have caught this in one of his columns ) was rough on writers who talked about " spirit , " intellectualsin flight from the material realities of the present age . Corde could name you ten subjects on which they could never agree.  |p123And  if he himself had been thoroughly clear in his mind , if the subjects had been cleanly thought out and resolved , there would be no difficulty in discussing them . So it was evident that Albert Corde was a spoilt case . Dewey pressed him about his motives for writing those Harper 's articles . What was the real explanation ? Again , the high intention  --  to prevent the American idea from beingpounded into dust altogether . And here is our American idea : liberty , equality , justice , democracy , abundance . And here is what things are like today in a city like Chicago . Have a look ! How does the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been deprived of the capacity to experience them . Corde recognizedhow arrogant he had been . His patience was at an end . He had had enough . He was now opening his mouth to speak . And now , look out ! In the American moral crisis , the first requirement was to experiencewhat was happening and to see what must be seen . The facts were covered from our perception . More than they had been in the past ? Yes , because the changes , especially the increase in consciousness  --  and also in false consciousness  --  was accompanied by a peculiar kind of confusion . The increase of theories and discourse , itself a cause of new strange forms of blindness , the false representations of " communication , " led to horrible distortions of public consciousness . Therefore the first act of morality was to disinter the reality , retrieve reality , dig it out from the trash , representit anew as art would represent it . So when Dewey talked about the " poetry , " pouring scorn on it , he was right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes , but not insofar as Corde was genuinely inspired . Insofar as he was inspired he had genuine political significance . We were no longer talking about anything . The language of discourse had shut out experience altogether . Corde had accordinglyspoken up  --  or attempted to speak up . I tried to make myself the moralist of seeing . I laid it on them . They mostly hated me for it . My own real consciousness had become intermittent over many years . That 's what being spoilt means , in my case ; it means fitfulnessof vision . Now you have it , now you do n't . That leads top124exaggeration , also . Anyway , that was what I had in mind . Those Chicago guys may be right to hate me . I may deserve it . But not for this . I was speaking up for the noble ideas of the West in their American form . Which no one was asking me to do , and which I took upon myself without even thinking who the hell was I ! A kind of natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Americandemocracy . It 's also my city . I have a right to picture it as I see it . " Or else , " The public does n't apprehend events which must be apprehended . " And I intended to stick it to everybody . " But you 've got to go . Okay , " said Dewey . " I 'll walk you to the car . " Never again would the gesturing excited adolescent weedy Spangler be seen . There was now a stout dwarfish man awkwardlytrying to get out of the booth , pushing on the table with his knuckles . His beard gave him an aspect of decent seniority . But he was half plastered . Corde , waiting for him , was also feeling the drink , for as his friend labored to rise , he looked to him like a kind of human plant  --  a short , fleshy trunk , and a spherical , overfull , overfructified face , rejoicing in itself . So go to it . Rejoice . Dewey moved him . Everything seemed to move him now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " There 's plenty of time . I wish this had been a longer drink . You were putting me on , about the White House , asking me to use my connections , and then it turns out to be too late . " " I guess I should n't have . Still , you passed the test . " " No big deal , I suppose . But you are a funny guy . You made a crisis for me with your scoop from Potsdam . I opened The New Yorker and was knocked over . My pal Albert , who used to dither about Blake and Yeats , writing a firsthand report about Stalin and Churchill , Truman . Stalin 's demonic force . We had the Bomb . UncleJoe 's armies were used up  --  but he got what he wanted . How come ? Anyhow , you hit the ground running . You were made by that piece . Then you turned around and unmade yourself . That 's mighty peculiar . I can still remember how burned up I was , how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it for you . You and I may have been intoxicated with the ' monuments of unaging in/tellect , ' but you were n't too intoxicated to use your dad 's pull . He had a drag with Harry Vaughan . " " Since , as you say , I unmade myself , you can forget about that now . " " I wanted to have a talk with you , Albert . Can we get together again ? " " You 're the one with the busy schedule . I 'll wait for a call . " " What about Christmas Day ? " " I ca n't tell you right now . " " Because you do n't know when your mother-in-law will die ? I see that . " " Most of the time , I 'm at your disposal . Free . There 's a friend of ours coming over from Chicago  --  a woman named Viada . But she 'll be here for quite a while . Look , when you talk to your Washington office , ask your staff about the Chicago trial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discuss that with you , too . It was on my agenda for today . " When Corde returned , Minna said , " Traian will drive us . " " All three ? " " Yes . " They sat down to a dinner of cold leftovers . Little was said at table . For a change , Tanti Gigi was silent . Tonight she was neither the kid sister nor the charming girl who had once lived in London , but a tense old woman , her strained neck with its bobbed hair bent over her plate . Traian was punctual . He rapped at a pane of the curtained diningroom door and asked permission to come in . Obese and Mexican-looking , he had long tufts of hair at the corners of his mouth . He wore his trousers close and tight , especially at the crotch . His many-zippered Hell 's Angels leather jacket was reddish , his bootsp126were black and highly polished . He was particularly attentive to Tanti Gigi . Of course , he had known her for most of his life . Probablyshe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a small boy . They rose from the table and went into the vestibule . Orlon-Dacron fur coats hung there , purplish brown , but even these synthetics were saturated with the fragrance of the ladies , even ( so Corde felt ) with their personalities . To the right was the primitive kitchen , to the left the old-fashioned water closet . Above were closed cupboards containing boxes of family relics , documents . Traian handed Gigi into the china-closet elevator , aligned the swinging doors , pressed the button . Squeezed into a corner , Corde lifted up his coat collar , tied the muffler over it tightly , bracing himself for the street . Minna looked sternly absentminded ; gracefullydissociated as well . By the small light , her white face was dark under the eyes . The outward curve of her upper lip , the pressuremarks of her severe chin , almost made a stranger of her . Corde was carrying the plastic Christmas bag with the Kents in it . Minna got into the front seat of the Dacia while Traian was hookingup the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't lock them in the glove compartment . " Albert , give me the cigarettes , " " she said . When Traian sat behind the wheel , Minna spoke to him , handed him one of the cartons . He opened it and filled the door pocket with Kents . No surprise , no problem ; he was on . He drove to the hospital . Gigi , sitting beside Corde in the back seat , seemed incapable of speaking . Snow might have helped that night , brightened the streets . It had begun to fall earlier but soon petered out . No one went strollingin this blackness . There was only an occasional car . Corde thought he had never seen such street lamps before  --  something like phosphorescent humus inside the globes . But at the hospital the porter 's lodge was brightly lighted . There were women from the country waiting for passes , peasants in boots and kerchiefs . Then up came Tanti Gigi in the draggled Orlonfur , her bent back and bobbed gray hair , a splash of terror on her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at thep127ground . The porter had Minna and Corde on his visitors list and handed them their passes . Traian got him to come outside . The man carried a clipboard ; he was booted , a white smock came to his knees , he wore a woolen watch cap . His look was sulky . Primped to say no , thought Corde . Traian took the man by the arm and began to talk to him privately . Next to the porter 's lodge there was an outer waiting room , shaped like a trolley car and well lighted . Gigi entered it and sat down . As they went up the driveway together , Corde said to Minna , " Poor Gigi is scared . Do you think he 'll get her in ? " " He seems to know his way around .... " They entered the main building . Just inside the doors was a wide hall , a clerk behind a wicket , another long queue . Then two more spacious dark rooms , and then a door with frosted glass : Intensive Care . Corde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Drur , on duty tonight . Round-faced , speaking softly , she shook Minna 's hand with particular warmth . That was significant , the sympathy . Again , Minna and Corde went through the robing routine  --  sterile gowns , caps , masks , the swelling white overshoes tied with tapes . " Mammi ! " said Minna . Corde followed slowly and stood in the door of the cubicle , but the doctor motioned him to come closer . Valeria 's right hand stirred , as much as she could manage . The movement was slight . She knew what was happening , you could see that in the blind face . Also , the monitoring devices speeded up , briefly . Standing by the bed , Corde was much moved , but unsure what to do beyond signifying somehow that he would keep Minna from harm . He bent near and rumbled , " It 's Albert , Valeria . " She nodded . Minna drew down the gauze mask to kiss Valeria . Then the quick , plump doctor came up with a pad of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballpoint pen , and the old woman tried to write . No control , thought Corde . Ca n't manage . She formed a few letters but ended in a big loose spiral that crossed the yellow page . Minna and the doctor tried to make out the word . Corde 's guess was that she was asking still to be takenp128home . But a woman like Valeria would have made alternative preparations  --  plan A , plan B. Fully aware , and good and ready  --  that would be characteristic of her . He thought there was no other way to interpret the expression of her face ; he derived it even from the posture of her legs and from the old woman 's belly , which had risen higher than ever . On both sides of her face , the currents of hair were shining on the bed linen . Consciousness was as clear as it had ever been . No , more acute than ever , for when Minna signaled that he should take her hand ( again he noted the blue splayed knuckle , and the blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers promptly . He said , " We came as soon as possible . " Then , as if he should not delay the essential message , he said in his deep voice , " I also love you , Valeria . " This had a violent effect . One of her knees came up , her eyes , very full under the skin of the lids , moved back and forth . She made an effort to force them to open . Her face was taken by a spasm . The monitors jumped simultaneously . All the numbers began to tumble and whirl . He might have killed her by saying that . Either because she believed him or because she did not . But she ought to have believed him . So far as he painfully knew , it was the truth . The doctor was startled by the speed of the flashing digits . She motioned to Corde and Minna to step back . No , to go . They returned to the staff room . He took off his gown . He could hardly bear this . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minna said , " That was right , what you told her . " Corde was less sure of that . Then Minna said , " Albert , what kind of state do you think she 's in ? " He thought the soul was loosened in Valeria , ready to pull out , and that she could therefore know you for what you were . He answered nothing . The doctor came in and the women spoke . Minna said , " It 's all right on the monitor again . " She said she would go out now and fetch her aunt . She was determined to get her in . She said , " Valeria was the big sister ; she always took care of her . Tonight I have to do it . " Gigi had n't even asked to be brought . Corde fig/ured that here in the Soviet bloc you learned to refrain from asking . And then , too , Gigi depended on Minna as she had done on Valeria . But it turned out that Minna had promised her aunt  --  she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . You 'll see her ! " Minna folded and laid down the sterile gown and the boots  --  she was even now thorough in her orderliness , absentmindedly ritualistic . She told the doctor that she was going out for a few minutes . She 'd be right back . The apprehensive doctor did not question her but shook her head . This was wrong . The rules were being broken . What if the Colonel should burst in ? As Corde helped Minna over the ice of the sloping driveway , the evergreens made a chill sound above them , as if things could simmer also below freezing . Passive , stooped and silent , Gigi sat waiting to see whether Minna would keep her promise . She would . Traian 's signal was that the cigarettes had worked , the fix was in . So the two women now went up the slope to the main building , while Corde took Gigi 's place beside Traian on the bench . Then the waiting room lights were switched off . The porter , taking no chances , hid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . Now that he had had his way , the matter was closed . The doctors had probably told him that it was all over with Valeria , and the deal with the Minister of Health was , " Let them come . " Meanwhile , Valeria 's mind was clear . This was what impressed Corde most deeply . She could still hear and understand everything , and respond . Probably Dr. Drur with the soft face , and the intensive care staff , talked with her , kept her informed . A physicianherself ( the founder of this hospital ) , Valeria had seen plenty of people go . The woman doctor seemed particularly close to her . To have a woman in attendance was a good thing . She had probablysaid , " Your daughter has permission tonight . " Valeria would understand what this signified . There again you saw the extent of the woman connection , its great importance . Dr. Drur had n't doped Valeria ( professional courtesy ) and she , .. was dying in clear consciousness . And Corde contrasted this withp130the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had gone through the window and was falling . The young man had played a kind of game that night , assuming the usual safe conditions , but the conditions were missing  --  he had a gag in his throat and two or three seconds to recognize that he was finished . He , Corde , had more in common with that boy than with the old woman . She did n't have their sort of mind , the modern consciousness , that equivocal queer condition , working with a net of foolish assumptions , and so much absurd unwanted stuff lying on your heart . He was impressed with Valeria . ( Could n't he attributeit to his equivocal consciousness that he was so much impressed ? ) She and Dr. Raresh , Marxists , had gone into the streets with roses to greet the Russians , lived to see the prison state , repented . She went back to the old discipline , believed in the good , probably took it all seriously about the pure in heart seeing God , and the other beatitudes . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside those of her husband . Though it went against the grain , he suspected that his nephew may have been right , that on the night he was killed Rick Lester had been out for dirty sex , and it was this dirty sex momentum that had carried him through the window . Corde understood this far better than he understood the old woman 's beliefs . So what was the pure-in-spirit bit ? For an American who had been around , a man in his mid-fifties , this beatitude language was unreal . To use it betrayed him as a man wildly disturbed , a somehow crazy man . It was foreign , bookish  --  it was Dostoevsky stuff , that the vices of Sodom coexisted with the adoration of the Holy Sophia , cynicism joined with purity in the heart of the paradoxical Russian . He was no Russian but Huguenot and Irish by descent , a Midwesterner flattened out by the prairies , a journalist and a lousy college dean . He suspected that the academic connection had been getting to him . He could feel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen Wittenberg , never read a book " ; and it was no wonder that the classroom , the library environment , had driven him finally into the streets of Chicago , or that he had written  --  well , written that at the Cabrini Green black housing project ,  |p131some  man had butchered a hog in his apartment and had thrown the guts on the staircase , where a woman , slipping on them , had broken her arm , and screamed curses in the ambulance . She was smeared with pig 's blood and shriller than the siren . It was illuminationfrom a different side , Chicago light and color , not the Sermonon the Mount . He was strongly agitated . He thought , Had n't it been too easy , bribing the porter ? Had he let Minna and Gigi walk into a trap , where the Colonel would swoop down on the deathbed and grab them ? But what would he want to do that for  --  why arrest old Gigi ? No , Corde saw that he was beginning to think like those women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police colonel , who , right now , must be dining in his luxurious villa , eating delicacies and drinking special vintages . The New Class , or new New Class , lived like Texas millionaires . Corde with his twenty-odd years in Europe understood this . Millionsof Americans of his generation had gone out into the world . There were robustious theorists who maintained that this was one of the luckiest developments in history and had done humankind nothing but good . There was a very different point of view . Folks from Trenton , Topeka , Baton Rouge , who lived in Japan , Iran , Morocco , were , as he had read in a magazine , " representatives of the fantasmo imperium of corporate dollars . " It was in his dentist 's reception room that he had found this piece on American mercenariesand arms salesmen , " high-technology killers operating in Africa and Central America . " He had picked up this magazine from the top of the lighted tropical fish tank . He must ask Dewey Spangler about the " fantasmo imperium . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent on these twerps ? Americans living abroad are always supposed to ' represent ' something . But there 's you , for instance , Albert  --  what would you be representing ? " That would be a good question . What did Corde represent ? Who was this person sharing the bench with Ioanna 's nephew Traian ? He carried a U.S. passport and money and credit cards . He was dressed in coat , gloves , muffler and an encircling fedora over hisp132radar-dish face , his somewhat swelling eyes and plain mouth . He seemed to be picking up signals from all over the universe , some from unseeable sources . His neck was long ; his back , too , seemed to go on longer than was strictly necessary . He was a mid-Americanof mild appearance . He was aware of that . He called this " the Pullman car gentility " and believed he had inherited it from his Wilson-era grandfather . ( Corde did n't admire Woodrow Wilson . Wilson had done great harm . ) Anyway , he , Albert , was a Corde . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he had just told a dying old Macedonian woman in a Communist hospital that he loved her . This was the measure of the oddities life had compiled for him . " I also love you , Valeria . " But although she must have been longing to hear this , and although it was true ( it was , dammit , one hundred percent true ! ) , she was nevertheless so shocked that the machines began to flash and yammer and the doctor was scared witless . Why had he upset her ? He must have reminded her again of her fears , which she would carry into the life to come , or at least up to the gate of death . Perhaps there was no need to take this personally , or to compare himself , as he sometimes did , to a longtime sexual offender still on probation , though the most exacting parole officer would have been satisfied with him . Oh , those sexual offenses ! He was by the strictest marital standards decent , mature , intelligent , responsible , an excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be viewed from a positive aspect because he was a representative of the rotten West , lacking ballast , the product of an undesirable historicaldevelopment , a corrupted branch of humanity . One need n't go as far as the extremist Eastern dissidents who called Europe an incorrigible old whore and America her most degeneratedescendant , in the stage of general paresis . That was going far . But it was possible to suspect him of being incapable of sustaining a serious relationship , as seriousness was defined by the older , indeed archaic , branch of humanity with its eternal fixtures . Valeria would therefore be thinking that the world Corde came from was the world in which her daughter must live out her life.  |p133She  must depend now on that world and on this man . So Corde had been moved that in dying she should still be in torment over her daughter , and so Valeria heard his bass voice assuring her , and she was pierced with doubts . This " I also love you , " which made her squeeze his hand , might be true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitated moment , no good within an hour . He could see that , yes . It was very painful to him , too . If we could say what we meant , mean what we said ! But we did n't seem to be set up for it . We were set up instead in a habitualstate of hypnotic fixity , and this hypnotic fixity was the real fantasmo imperium . Well , never mind the philosophy . But on her deathbed an old woman hears the deep voice of her son-in-law , and it tells her that he loves her . Loves ! With what ! Nevertheless it was true , however queer . There was nothing too rum to be true . He depended on that now . Although Valeria  --  she was n't going to have time to verify his declaration . She 'd have to take his word for it , because for her this world of death was ending . World of death ? He surprised himself when he put it that way . More of his poetry , Dewey Spangler would have said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had those sharp and healthy teeth . Same dazzlingteeth ; the ginger marmalade beard was their new setting . Still Dewey had asked him one really hot question : Why a professor in Chicago ? Corde might have answered that the reason was coming , it was on its way . There were hidden and extensive fantasy ambitions and grand designs connected with it . At the moment of decision , it had been convenient that he should have no clear outline . He remembered how surprised his sister had been when he moved back . " Why a college , and why here ? " Elfridainquired . He could n't really answer , but he did say , " For me it 's more like the front lines . Here is where the action is . " " I would n't have left Paris , not with an apartment on Rue Vaneau . Did you sell it for a fortune ? " " No fortune . " " Then getting away from some French broad or other ? "  | " No , that was n't it , either , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even going into hiding , or taking holy orders . " " Who said , ' When you 're tired of Paris you 're tired of life ' ? " " It was said about London . And the same party said that no man of what he called ' intellectual enjoyment ' would immerse himself and his posterity in American barbarism . But that was two hundred years ago . " " That 's a real book answer , " was Elfrida 's comment . " You want to spend the rest of your life reading books in a college ? Do n't expect me to swallow that . I know you better . You 're not a retirementtype . You do n't look it , but you 're a combative type . You just said you were looking for action . " " When I was a kid I had martial instincts . " " You do still . I ca n't dope you out , Albert . What advantage do you see here ? " " There 's the big advantage of backwardness . By the time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to see through . You do n't have to bother with them and it saves lots of trouble . " He stopped these thoughts and recollections , for he now caught sight of Minna and Gigi walking carefully , slow , down the slope under the pines . Corde went out to meet them . He asked no questions . No one spoke . It had n't been a long visit . Maybe the doctor , frightened by Minna 's boldness , had asked them to leave . The Colonel had n't surprised them . No , the Colonel now cared nothing about any of them . Traian opened the dark green doors of the tub-shaped Dacia . The interior was freezing . At home , too , it was too cold to get into bed . " Albert , I ca n't take my clothes off . " Corde poured from the palinca bottle . " Let 's swallow some of this . " They sat in their coats . When Corde removed his hat , he felt the cold on his bald crown . " You did n't stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took her completely by surprise withp135Gigi . I think there were watchers everywhere . " " And what did Gigi say ? " " She did n't say anything , just put her hand on Mother 's arm . Lie down with me , Albert . " He pulled the heavy covers from his bed and piled them on hers . Then he turned off the tiny orange-tinted light bulb under the big parchment lampshade . Minna presently fell asleep . Corde , stretched beside her along the edge of the bed , went into a state of blankness for the rest of the night . In the morning Minna was on the telephone again , trying to reach Dr. Moldovanu , the passionate daughter still fighting for her mother . Corde thought , She ca n't accept that it 's over , the end , she saw Valeria for the last time . But that was a lot to ask . He was being too sensible . It was one of his persistent failings . And so there he was , as usual . It was morning , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cups of Gigi ' s coffee . It was too weak to revive him after his night of blankness . He frowned at the packet of mail from his office . After his catatonic night on the edge of the bed , under the burdensome stiff weight of the Balkan rugs , he was too tired , felt too tender and sore inside , to take on those letters from Chicago . He opened his briefcaseinstead and looked for the Beech documents . He must get them read before Vlada Voynich arrived . To be idle this morning was a bad idea . If he did n't pull himself together he 'd suffer from random thoughts . Those were the worst  --  they ate you up . Clearingan efficient space on the desk , he set himself to study Beech 's scientific papers . He began with Vlada 's abstract . Immediately he found his antidote to the distress of random ideas . " Beech picked you , on the basis of those articles in Harper 's , to be his interpreter , " she wrote . " And since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requested that I give you a little preliminary guidance . I am glad you had the opportunity to meet him . His reactions to you were very positive . " ( I liked him , too , thought Corde . Beech was a terrific fellow . Also , to get an eminent man 's positive reaction was pleasing . ) " The situation is of the most urgent importance , " he further read . " Beech wants his case stated not only to the general public but also to the Humanists . " This gave Corde pause . Who were these Humanists , and why should Beech imaginethat they were a group to whom any case could be stated ? And if there was such a group , why should it be inclined to pay attention to Corde ? He considered how to discuss this with a geologistlike Beech . " You want to understand humanist intellectuals ? Think of the Ruling Reptiles of the Mesozoic .... " Corde meantime read on . " I think you said that you listened to the tapes he gave you . In those he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his discoveries and explained what they signified for the future of our species and , consequently , why they presented such an emotional problem for those who drew the inevitablelogical conclusions . " Yes , Corde had listened to the tapes . In the first minute , Beech said they had been made last summer in a Kansas barn . " Looking through the big open door over the summerwheat fields , " the scientist had flatly intoned . " The Great Plains . My native grounds . " Vlada had told Corde in Chicago , " Albert , it was my doing , partly . I brought your articles to Beech 's attention because I knew he was looking for somebody who had the necessary skills . Also the brains . " Vlada spoke with the fully centered assurance of a stout woman . Her face was wide and pale , the brown Balkan eyes were large  --  no soft glances , but urgent business , shrewdness . She did not invite you to take part in dream enterprises ; she was an extremely shrewd lady . ( At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful ones . But never mind that now . ) Beech himself had been more diffident . " After you 've listened to these tapes and studied the materials , perhaps you 'd consider further discussions leading to eventual collaboration . Naturally , I have ap137special point of view , as the man who directed the research  --  in the inside position , right in the middle . " Beech 's mildness had a special charm for Corde . What a nice man ! And when you consideredwhat a terrific charge he carried , the responsibility for such frightening findings ( would the earth survive ? ) , how gallant his mildness was . He said to Corde , " You , the author of those special articles , might  --  you just might  --  be able to blow the whistle . I want to stop everybody in their tracks and force them to follow . And you can be gripping . As with the blacks you described in public housing and in the jails ... " " I did n't please everybody . " " I would assume not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description of the inner city , I said , ' Here 's a man who will want the real explanation of what goes on in those slums . ' " " And ' the explanation ? What is the real explanation ? " " Millions of tons of intractable lead residues poisoning the childrenof the poor . They 're the most exposed . The concentration is measurably heaviest in those old slum neighborhoods , piled up there for decades . It 's the growing children who assimilate the lead fastest . The calcium takes it up . And if you watch the behaviorof those kids with a clinical eye , you see the classic symptoms of chronic lead insult . I 've asked Vlada Voynich to include **27;8915;TOOLONG findings from the New England Journal of Medicine with the other papers . Crime and social disorganization in inner city populations can all be traced to the effects of lead . It comes down to the nerves , to brain damage . " Polite Corde , with silent lips , nodding , doubted this . He wore a look of quiet but high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything had a direct material cause ? If you gave people employment , money , clothing , shelter , food , protected them from infectionand from poison , they would n't be criminal , they would n't be mad , they would n't despair ? Sure , the right programs , rightly administered , would fix it . Direct material causes ? Of course . Who could deny them ? But what was odd was that no other causes were conceived of . " So it 's lead , nothing but old lead ? " he said.  | " I would ask you to study the evidence . " And that was what Corde now began to do , reading through stapled documents , examining graphs . You could n't easily hide the sign of the crank from an experiencedjournalist , and as Spangler had said , these scientists were diapered babies when they went public with a cause . But Beech somehow inspired respect . There was a special seriousness about him . He was even physically , constitutionally serious . His head , for a body of such length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Light hair , grizzled and cropped Marine style , gave him an old-fashioned hayseed look . His cheeks were austerely creased , his glance was dry . Corde had checked on his credentials . He was indeed an eminent man of science . That was unanimous . He had authoritatively dated the age of the earth , had analyzed the rocks brought back from the moon . Corde was beginning to think that with pure scientists , when they turned their eyes from their own disciplines , there were , occasionally , storms of convulsive clear consciousness ; they suffered attacks of confusing lucidity . Therefore Corde had listened closely to the tapes . In his small Chicago study he had switched off the lights , plugged in his headphones . And here in Bucharest , too , he read with care . Consider : Eastern Europe as a place to read about endangered humanity . Corde was at Valeria 's table and sore , rubbed raw within ; he could feel the rawness as he bent over Beech 's papers . He pressed his hands , for warmth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial centuries had vastly increased the mining and smelting of lead , and the unavoidable dispersal of lead in air , water , soil , was a danger too little understood . We had been " authoritatively assured " that lead levels were normal and tolerable . Far from it . Official standards are worse than incorrect ; they are dangerously false . Investigations are conductedin laboratories themselves heavily contaminated . Only resultsobtained in ultra-clean sanctuary laboratories are dependable . These are few in number but only their evidence counts , and this evidence tells us that lead levels are about five hundredfold abovep139natural prehistoric levels . The true levels have been established by fossil bone analysis , by the examination of the sediments of fresh and marine waters , of old tree-stem woods , of snow strata in the Antarctic , and of Greenland ice . The " emissions of forest foliage " have also been investigated , together with crustal components of silicate dusts , sea sprays and volcanic sulfurs . This mass of measurementsand supporting data ( " isotopic compositions " ) excited Corde , moved him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so liable to get agitated ? " ) Radioactivity , of course , and also the depletion of the ozone layer by aerosols he was as familiar with as the next man . But on the midnight tapes recorded in the summer fields of Kansas , Corde had heard also of the chemical saturation of the soil by insecticides and fertilizers . This was why America was the world 's greatest food producer . At what a cost ! But the lead was far more dangerous than any of these . Beech 's voice went on like the plains themselves . Government agencies assigned the task of measurement and control were incompetent , said Beech . They lacked the necessary instruments and correct procedures . The true magnitude of this deadly poisoning of water , vegetation and air was discovered by the pure sciences of geochronology , cosmology and nuclear geochemistry . A truly accurate method of detecting tiny amounts of lead led to the discovery that the cycle of lead in the earth had been strongly perturbed . The conclusion : Chronic lead insult now affects all mankind . Biological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be considered among the causes of wars and revolutions . Mental disturbances resulting from lead poison are reflected in terrorism , barbarism , crime , culturaldegradation . Visible everywhere are the irritability , emotionalinstability , general restlessness , reduced acuity of the reasoning powers , the difficulty of focusing , et cetera , which the practiced clinician can readily identify . This irritability , this combination of inflammation and deadening  --  byGod , I feel it myself ! And I certainly observe it wherever I look ! If he had been at home , Corde would have gone to the Britannicafor more information . Fat medical books jutted from thep140shelves , within reach , but he was ignorant of Rumanian , weak in German . But for what Beech was getting at he needed no encyclopedia . We could n't ourselves observe the dulling of consciousness since we were all its victims , and we would be dulled down into the abyss unaware that we were sinking . Tetraethyl fumes alone could do it  --  engine exhaust  --  and infants eating flaking lead paint in the slums became criminal morons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral visionary . He accused the engineers . Applied science , engineering technology , these were the powers of darkness which had poisoned land , air and water , the forests , the animals , the cities , and our own human cells . Here was an apocalypse  --  yet another apocalypse to set before the public . It would n't be easy . The public was used to doom warnings ; seasoned , hell  --  it was marinated in them . And there are evils , as someone has pointed out , that have the ability to surviveidentification and go on forever  --  money , for instance , or war . Those that are most determined to expose them can get no grip upon them . In the current language , that of the mass situation , nothing could be communicated . Nothing was harder to get hold of than the most potent , i.e. , the most manifest evils . Here science itself , which was designed for deeper realization , experienced a singular failure . The genius of these evils was their ability to create zones of incomprehension . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't see them . Evidently Beech had begun to feel their power . He could n't pass through , could n't get a hearing . He did well to come to Albert Corde , therefore . It was a sound instinct to ask the man who had written those Harper 's pieces to get him through the blockaded zones . If I were convinced , I could do the job for him . And it would n't be by the agitprop , demagogic , haranguing , or the advertising or mystagogic methods ; no fantasmo imperium , nothing but unfaltering earnestness , like the Ancient Mariner . You hold ' em with your glittering eye . " The wedding guest he beat his breast , Yet he can not choose but hear . " Beech was not another environmentalist simply . If he had been " one more of those , " Corde would never have given him the time of day . What he had learned by listening to his tapesp141with the closest attention was that the geophysicist had incorporatedthe planet itself into his deepest feelings , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beech was shocked by Homo sapiens sapiens , by its ingratitude and impiety . Homo sapiens sapiens was incapable of hearing earth 's own poetry , or , now , its plea . Man would degrade himself into an inferior hominid . ( The biologicallanguage was Beech 's own . ) Corde felt that they had a lot in common , he and Beech . There was even a physical affinity . Both were plain-looking men from the Midwest , in their late fifties , each with his own stratagem for keeping his noble values out of sight until the moment of disclosure ( sometime before the end , and before , one hoped , it was too late ) . And then to whom did you disclose ? Well , you went public , you printed in Harper 's , or else you chose a spokesman , a Corde , and approached him with a proposition . This process ( a scientist 's discovery and its sequel ) was in itself , taken as an episode in the evolution of the soul , a singularly moving thing . You would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cactus , this scientific Beech , would at last cough up so large and exquisite a flower . ( The earth as a being ; earth 's own poetry . ) So , then , the problem : Deeperrealizations were accorded only to the sciences , and there withinstrict limits . The same methods , the same energies , could not be applied to the deeper questions of existence . It was conceivable , even , that science had drawn all the capacity for deeper realizationsout of the rest of mankind and monopolized it . This left everyone else in a condition of great weakness . In this weakness people did poetry , painting , humanism , fiddle-faddle  --  idiocy . Terribly moved , restless , clawed within , Corde could not sit still . He heaved himself up from the table ( with its history of homework , its treasures of sentiment ) and went to look for Minna . He found her with Gigi in the dining room . Of course they were talking about Valeria . He did not interrupt their conversation but stood on the sidelines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he leaned against the doorframe . Just looking , swelleyed , through his goggles , and with a silent mouth . Under the thick-legged dining room table the vivid color had gone out of thep142Balkan carpet , it was sere and wrinkled . The birds in the pattern could scarcely fly . The cyclamens on the sideboard were also worked with faint patterns  --  the dark leaves had a whitish underpattern , varied with gray , making a smaller heart shape within the heart shape of the leaf . The flowers were white . " What 's up ? " said Corde at last . " What 's the latest ? " " They ca n't move her , " said Minna . " Dr. Gherea was very sorry . " Did you talk to the lady friend ? Is that who told you ? " " I talked to Dr. Drur . " Gigi looked towards Corde , not directly at him . Her eyes were deep dark brown and fluid . The work of the beauty parlor was undone at the back , where her hair came apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bangs were neatly combed out on her forehead . She had put on a dress today and high heels and lipstick . Maybe she did n't want the news of her sister 's death to catch her in the brown dressing gown . This tragic old lady with the tarty , Frenchy name  --  if grief added weight to the body , it might come out in the curvature of her legs , for today she looked more bandy-legged . Corde also observed  --  perhaps it was the cut of the dress she wore  --  how strong her neck was . The neck muscleswere heavy . " Anyhow , " said Minna , " surgery is out of the question . " Of course it was . No respiration , no anesthesia . " Dear Albert ! Shall I brew a pot of tea ? " " Thank you , no , Tanti Gigi . I 'm doing a bit of paper work . I 'll go back . " He was far too restless to sit with the women . He would as soon have had the tea poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word from your friend Spangler ? " said Minna . " I would n't expect much from him . " " Now is when I should be with her , " said Minna . There was no answer to make . He muttered only that he would go back to his papers . Again , the room ! There was something in Corde 's throat , some East Europeanp143condensation , and it took East European brandy to clear it . He took two shots from the bottle while he reorganized the desk , puttingaside the Beech documents . This mace of lead that was knockingour brains out . . . Palinca left a kind of stale plum aftertaste . He sweetened his mouth with a few brown grapes , the last of them . Waiting for death , you see . There was very little he could do . And now , at last , he took up the large manila envelope of mail from Chicago . Censorship had obviously unstuck the tapes . He had noticed that yesterday . Disgusted , he lifted the crisscrossed tapes with the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ ! all this stuff , these unwanted clippings and papers ; nothing but trouble . Corde 's posture was habitually relaxed , and as he went through his mail his body was turned three-fourths aside , askance , in " relaxed " avoidance . He held the sheaf unwillingly , passing paper after paper to the back . On his own turf , he was at war . He could n't say why it was necessary to be fighting there . But now , caught up in it , he had to see it through . Had n't Elfrida told him that he was a combative type ? Miss Porson ( or Ms. , as she had taken to signing herself ) had enclosed art elaborate memorandum , a bulletin from the front . She said she regretted sending him some of these items . He could do without them , where he was . " It must be a bad scene . My heart goes out to Minna . " Towards Minna Miss Porson ' s female generosityand admiration were boundless . " Her wonderful style , the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeding , " Miss Porson would say . This Miss Porson of his , Fay Porson , was an old slob ( he was at present inclined to call her that ) of no little charm . She could n't have been much younger than Tanti Gigi , but she boasted that she turned on lovers half her age . In her late sixties , she was fleshy , but her bearing was jaunty . Her plump face , heavily made up , was whitish pink , as if washed in calamine lotion , and on some days she painted a raccoon band across her face in blue eye shadow  --  the mask of a burglar or a Venetian reveler . She kept up her pants with heavy **29;8944;TOOLONG . The permanent Miss Porson , the Miss Porson of the deeper strata , turned out to be a bridge-playing Westchester matron . She had come to Chicago with her midlevel executive husband . Here she was widowed and here she preferred to remain . She could swing in Chicago . She was going to " put the sex into sexagenarian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was not the supersecretary and faultless organizer she claimed to be ; she was overpaid . His dislike of administrative detail had made a hostage of him . Her erotic confidences and boasts set his teeth on edge . But he would not have been able now to replace her . She wrote that there was only more of the same in the papers . As far as the press was concerned , Mr. Detillion could do no wrong , for the time being , anyway . As her late father would have said , they had Mr. Corde 's head " in chancery " and they loved it . ( " Chancery , " Corde had learned , was a term from the days of John L. Sullivan : You caught your opponent 's head under your arm and rubbed it with bare knuckles . ) This , she continued , could n't go on forever ; the good guys would have their innings by and by . If the true facts could only be made known  --  how differentit would look ! The Dean was still struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms. Porson wished the detailscould be leaked to reporters . There was , for instance , the IRS matter , originally mishandled by Mr. Detillion when he signed a waiver on the statute of limitations because he was so confident that the government had no case . So now the IRS claim , with interest , was up to $23,000 , and although the new lawyer , Mr. Gershenkorn , was doing his best , and would get an extension while the Dean was out of the country , he could n't promise success . All this information , supplied in pure kindness , stuck in Corde 's throat . For his morale , she enclosed copies of fan letters from his readers . She admitted that some hate mail had also come in . She was saving it for his return . Most of the poison-pen notes were from the suburbs , where the diehard Chicago boosters all lived . Commuterswho escaped from race problems and crime were indig/nant because he had told it as it was . She reported that the Provost had sent a note : The Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take care of Minna in this tragic moment . He expressed himself with great decency and delicacy , said Miss Porson . There was one message for Minna , from the Mount Palomar Observatory . They would try to rearrange schedules in order to give her some telescope time in January . The rest of Miss Porson 's memorandum itemized the notes and letters she was forwarding . He went thoough the memo again , for it was inconceivable that it should contain no mention of Lydia Lester . He had left Miss Porsonin charge of that girl , and most of his last instructions had to do with her protection . He had spent the better part of an hour just before departure spelling it out on the telephone . Fay Porson had seemed to see the point . In fact , she had made remarks Corde had had no desire to hear , about the mixture of fatherly solicitude and guilt that motivated him . " Because it was you , Dean , that pushed for the trial ? And the girl is so delicate ? But she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end she decided that she wanted that pair to pay for what they did to the poor young husband  --  it was her own decision . You take too much on yourself , Dean . " Corde had little liking for these psychological insights , but he had let himself in for them . You confided in people , you had to . From this came dependency , and then unwanted intimacy , and presentlyyou discovered  --  horrifying !  --  that though Porson listened and nodded and looked as clever as Alexander Woollcott ( whom she strikingly resembled ) and as melting as a mother , that though you moved her to tears , she was an exasperating dumbhead , and a lustful old frump . " Not to worry ! " was her last word to him , but obviously she had n't even spoken to Lydia . He made yet another search . No , not a word about the girl . How could a beautiful young woman interest Fay Porson , who had just discovered her own youthfulness . She had her own sexual fat to fry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave . She was like that lascivious old womanin Aristophanes , claiming equal sexual rights with the other " girls , " grabbing at all the handsome young men . And thosep146young men would n't know what they were getting into until it was time to do the act . . . . But Corde went no further . He relented . It occurred to him that Lydia Lester might have complained to the Porson about him , said that he had dropped out at the worst moment , abandoned her . Corde had canceled all appointments during the trial . He had never missed a single session at Thirteenthand Michigan , the auxiliary Criminal Courts Building . He had laid on a car to call for Lydia each morning . He would n't allow her to take public transportation to that part of the city . Not even a cab was safe . Cabs were filthy and reckless , they stank . Cabbies hustled you , they were known to come on sexually with young women . Corde was taking no chances . Lydia was as delicateas she was tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock . He was on hand well before court convened , sat with her before she was called to the stand , and tried to transmit waves of support while Maxie interrogated her . The Detillion caper had its own special interest . Maxie was taking no fee in this case . True , it was a PR gold mine for him , win or lose . Still , from habit , the legal-fee meter must have been clicking in his head , and he was desperately aware of what it was all costing him , of the drain , the sacrifice , of the outstanding bills he might have paid with a retainer . Yes , thought Corde , and because he conned me down in Joliet and screwed me up in Chicago , he is , by his logic , the injured party . That 's how it works . You swindle a man and then grab even the sense of injury for yourself . A devouring man devours all there is . So it was possible that Lydia Lester felt abandoned by the Dean . Maybe she , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had dragged her into this . It was the Dean 's nephew who molestedher and the Dean 's cousin who afflicted her ; it was the Dean who had published those articles of his at just the wrong moment , and then at the climax the Dean took off . She may well have burst out with this , and the Porson , too tactful to transmit tears and grievances at such a time , would n't even mention her name . But he was attributing far too much finesse to the old girl  --  the usualp147mistake . She had simply forgotten . The Cordes had a spare room in Chicago , and Corde had suggested to Minna that Lydia should stay with them . Poor thing , she needed support . Corde had that sort of fervent pity in him . It was more than pity , however ; it was also admiration . This girl , who looked as if she would crumble if some cabby propositioned her , if a derelict exhibited himself , who answered Detillion so faintly that he had to say , " Speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispering " =this Lydia was punctual every morning , her blouse freshly ironed , her hair smoothly pinned . Corde said to Minna , " When I first urged her to do this she said absolutely not , she could n't . Then I wondered whether it would be better not to start only to have her breaking down , but I misjudged her completely . It 's like you get to the very limit of your weakness and then you come to a door , and if you have just enough strength to open that door you find all kinds of force inside . The girl found it . If I were still talking to Detillion  --  and you know how Detillion is with his sex business : if he should ever be elected to office , he would n't put his hand on a Bible to take the oath , he 'd put it on his cock  --  if I were talking to that pig , I 'd say , ' You 're missing the whole point , Cousin . ' Minna said , " There 's one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any lost soul . " " Well , it 's only ' just suppose . ' I would n't think of talking to that meathead . And you 're right , you 've spotted one of my bad tendencies . I seem to carry this indignation load . But what I wanted to say about Lydia is that it 's wonderful when a quality comes out you never would have expected . You look at the girl and she looks pale and ailing . She herself has a faint image  --  those long defenselesshands , the way she holds them . Lots of nice girls are brought up that way , with too faint an image of themselves . The family tells them they are n't strong . At lunchtime , when the court recesses , she has a small collapse . I drive her over to the Cantonese Chef on Wentworth Street so that she can rest her eyes in a dark booth . She has light-sensitive eye pains , like me . She gets a split/ting headache in the courtroom . But after a few spoons of wonton soup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prays for her to faint  --  she wo n't faint . " But Lydia Lester was n't invited to sleep in the Cordes ' guest room . Minna did n't like having a stranger in the house , opening drawers , reading mail and bank statements . She did n't put it that way . She said , " You must n't forget , Albert , that we 'd have to leave her here alone when we went to Mount Palomar . " Corde yielded . He did n't share her sense of privacy , but he did n't argue ; he let Minna have her way . He regretted it now . It would have been good for the girl . A protective atmosphere . Maybe another girl of compatible temperament would have been willing to stay with her . They would have looked after the place , watered the plants . ( He still thought about his plants . ) And if you did n't run the showers the seal dried out in the drains and you had sewer gas coming up . The arrangement would have been compassionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women talked  --  they lived on the telephone . The instrument was warm with continual use . Corde kept his door ajar to hear what was going on . Ignorant of the language , he interpreted Minna 's tones . And he was the man of the house . They counted on him . Now and then one of them looked in to tell him the latest ; they did n't actually ask him for advice , but he gave them plenty of it , knowing that it would be disregarded for the most part . There was an additional telephone oddity . All calls were monitored . Somewhere in a burrow a man listened in . This agent made no effort to conceal his presence from these unimportant women . You heard him breathing , rattling papers , grumbling . Sometimes he even cut in : " That ai n't what you said yesterday . " Gigi said , " The man is obstreperous . I believe it possible that he is drinking . " Among the papers from Chicago Corde found a letter from RufusRidpath . That pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of support . Corde had written passionately about the Ridpath case . No one else had stood up for Ridpath publicly . Of course Ridpath was not rehabilitated , but he had said to Corde , " At least you putp149the main facts on record . " Mason junior dismissed Ridpath as " your kind of black man . " There was too much of the freak or crank about Corde ( liberal opinion 's way of dismissing him ) . His own way of putting it : " If A. Corde is a man of strength , how come his hands are shaking ? " Still the truth about Ridpath ( or something like it ) was now on record . No , it did n't signify much , unless it signified to make a friend . Corde achieved no practical result . Perhaps it was better for you not to have Corde take up your cause ? One of Corde 's respected colleagues at the college , Sam Michaels , had observed , " There 's less and less connection between blacks and whites . In the past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection . Now the blacks do n't want it , do n't seem to care for white relationships . " In Mason you saw an attempted reversal , a connection to be made on black terms . What terms were those ? Lucas Ebry 's terms ? They did n't exist . Unreal ! Young Mason 's idea of boldness put him in the servile position . Besides , Corde wrote , the effective black " image " had been captured by the black gangs , the Rangers and the El Rukins , and the outlaw chieftains  --  black princes in their beautiful and elegant furs , boots , foreign cars . They controlled the drug trade . They ruled in the prisons . For young blacks , of all classes , even perhaps for young whites , they provided a powerful model . But Ridpath had nothing to do with images , image-making . Removed from his post as director of the County Jail , Ridpath may have had to borrow money for his legal defense . He won his case but lost his reputation . People remembered the charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sam Michaels  --  a supershrewd observer : " They could n't prove the aggravated batterycharge . That might mean that the prosecution was clumsy . Ill-prepared , did n't have the skill to prepare a case . Acquittal does n't necessarily mean that Ridpath was innocent . " But Corde became convinced that powerful persons had been out to get the man . After repeated grand jury investigations  --  why so many ? instigated by whom ?  --  he had been indicted for brutalizingprisoners . Beatings in the cells ! The newspapers and net/works took out after him as if he had been Chicago 's Idi Amin . Having a murdered general 's head brought to the banquet table in a silver tureen ? Shooting one of your own ministers between the eyes at a state banquet ? You would have thought so . But the countycould n't make its charge stick . The defense was able to prove that deals had been arranged with the prosecution witnesses , who were promised shorter sentences . They had nothing to lose . Both were convicted murderers . Corde developed a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long talks with Wolf Quitman , the defense lawyer . He interviewed people who had had professional dealings with Ridpath . He liked the man . And presently Corde found that he had linked himself with him . One seldom understands quite how such links are formed . Ridpath wrote : " Hearing from your secretary that you had to leave the country suddenly because of your wife 's mother , I thought I would go down to Thirteenth and Michigan and look at what was happening there . When the case broke in the papers , I seemed to remember the defendant . Sure enough , I recognized this man Ebry as soon as I saw him . Over the years he was in and out of County . Petty stuff , same over and over , he had a pattern , mainly street hustling . Not an outstanding sensational personality , in fact kind of a fuzzy outline . The evidence is pretty bad against him and I do n't think your cousin will get him off , even acting the way he does in the courtroom . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual method of postponement after postponementby the lawyers until the witnesses moved away or died , and three , five , seven years later there would be no case . That 's the most common . That 's what your nephew hoped for . Where the press is concerned , you caused great resentment by your articles , implying they were lazy and cynical , and now you are their target of opportunity . Quitman and I both tipped you off to the danger when you were doing the research . Now they are in a position to do their number on you . As I look at it , the young man 's wife probably could n't see who pushed him out the window . It could have been either one . The prostitute is a tough gal , really fierce , and has a record of involvement in homicides . Thep151man is low-key , even dull . There is no good way to appraise these people 's actions , they all happen in fever-land .... I thought my impressions would be useful , knowing how much is riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full description of Ridpath in Harper 's . He was a man of hillocky build , short in the neck , with a powerful intelligent Negro head . His brief arms were widely separated by his cylinder chest ; his eyes , also wide-set , measured you with extremedetachment . Under this waiting broad-gauged gaze you were to say why you had asked to see him . He was distrustful at first . Close-shaven , his scalp went into furrows when he raised his brows and began to speak . His ears were small and neat . Althoughhe was completely dressed , coat and tie , nothing seemed in place . After several meetings , Corde concluded that he had no more than two suits , a gray and a brown . He also wore a belted plaid trench coat  --  if gray on gray could be described as a plaid . The hands , overlapped by shirt cuffs and coat sleeves , were also neat , not big . His arms were , so to speak , crowded apart by the high-breasted width of his body . And his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They could n't have done much harm to the killers who testified against him  --  not the hands alone . But of course the indictment was for aggravated battery ; bludgeon , blackjack  --  what weapon he was said to have used Corde could n't remember . Ridpath knew what " doing a number " was , because the papers had done a great one on him . Front-page close-ups made him look like Primo Carnera in black , and swelled and distorted his face as if he had acromegaly  --  they had thrown Ridpath into the distortionfurnace . Corde sometimes said about himself that he was often subject to fits of vividness . In ordinary contact there was a commonsenseindifference or inertia in what you saw . But in a vividness fit you had the hillocky man , the obese breast , small hands , short neck , cannonball head  --  all of it . And then came what Dewey Spangler , tempering sarcasm with sympathy , called " poetry , " " impressionism , " " exaltation . " Corde could n't say whetherp152this was set off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation of Ridpath had led him . Whatever the cause , the result was highly nervous , ragged , wild , uncontrolled , turbulent . Corde had tried to clear Ridpath 's reputation , but Ridpath 's gratitude and loyalty may have been severely tested when he read what Corde had written about black Chicago . The Dean himself may then have seemed to be somewhere in fever-land . And downtown , in higher circles of influence , people may have been saying , " What 's with this Professor ? What 's he talking ? His pilot light is gone out . " In this emotional state , " investigative reporting " was utterly out of the question . Wolf Quitman , Ridpath 's lawyer , must also have been puzzled by Corde . He could n't possibly have foreseen  --  well , who can foresee exaltation ? And Quitman was n't , himself , an exaltation type . He was tough , a very tough man who practiced criminal law . His toughness , however , was not of the repellent downtown Chicago sort . He was a clear-faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was muscular . His office was nothing at all like an office , more like a comfortable living room . A woolen shawl , presumably knitted by his wife , was folded on the chintz-and-maple sofa , and there were begonia plants all over the place . The begonias were set on glass shelves across the windows . ( Corde was bound to take in the presence of plants . ) EvidentlyQuitman did n't care to see City Hall over the way  --  a full block of ponderous limestone . Quitman said to Corde , " Professor , do you know what County Jail was like when Ridpath took it over ? " " Some idea . " " It was on the barn boss system . The gang chiefs ran it . Hard for you and me to imagine what went on there . Only by general terms , the catchwords . Damn rough scene . Drugs , rackets , homosexualrape . Plenty of money changing hands . Buy damn near anything you wanted . And people beaten and tortured . Lots of weapons . If you could work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife . If you soaked a rolled newspaper in the toilet and hung it from the window in winter , it froze into a club . You couldp153kill a man with it , and when it thawed where was the evidence ? Not exactly the Montessori school . Excuse me if I offend , but **28;8975;TOOLONG brought in , and they were afraid to go into the tiers and put down the barn bosses , or even look at them . You ca n't blame them for it , but they sat in the office and wrote reports , or articles for criminology journals , while the suicide figureswent up and up , and murders higher and higher . They did n't dare go into the tiers of the jail and they could n't take charge . " " Ridpath.went in ? " said Corde . " Of course . That 's just what happened . He 's a plain kind of a man . He goes by duty . The Mayor put him there , so it was his duty to take charge . " " Nobody really expected that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd probably say he assumed it was the necessary thing to do . No , he would n't even say that much . And the barn bosses respected him . He grew up on the streets himself . . . . He 's a thoughtful fellow . " Corde said , " Those are his people ? " " It 's an attachment he lives for . There are plenty of hustlers around who live off the black crisis . You 've met ' em , Professor , we 've all met ' em . Now , I 've been going almost daily to that jail for years . There 's where my clients are , that 's a joint I 'm totally familiar with . For Ridpath it was a sixteen-hour day , seven days a week , and that 's a place that leaves all the rest of them behind . " " So you say he was living in his office ? " " Like a cause , Professor , not like a job . He cut down murders and suicides . I do n't think anybody could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buggering . He gave it the best try anybodycould give . But that did n't impress the political guys much . What do you expect ? This is a damn tough city , and damn proud of being tough , and the County is the worst  --  what you 'd expect of Chicago . " " And Ridpath 's mission was to clean it up , " said Corde . " Out of the question completely , " said Quitman . " You must have some feeling for that  --  the savage , subsavage condition . Otherwise you would n't be in this kind of practice . "  |p154Quitman  did not care for this remark . He turned it aside . " You know what was wrong ? The man did n't remember to play ball , and you have to play ball , sir  --  you have to play it . County Jail has a big budget . Suppliers and contractors came to the office ( you understand who was sending ' em ) and he would n't do business . He said , ' If I do n't buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm having it boned right here . ' Too many savings . He saved a million dollars out of his budget and refunded it to the county . That money was supposed to be spent . What ? Save dough by using the kitchen staff ? Fuck the kitchen staff ! Rufus got a bad name with the top guys . They thought he might become dangerouspolitically , too . Why else was he refunding from his budget ? That 's why they gave him the business . " " Who ? " Plainly , Quitman was startled by the naivete of this question . He made no answer . Corde later obtained one from a Lakeview alumnus downtown  --  Silky Limpopo , who had been a star highjumper ( " over the bar like silk " ) and was now himself a criminal lawyer and a longtime City Hall Watcher . " You asked him who . Quitman would n't dream of telling you . Whoever thought Ridpathmight be dangerous , that 's who . Quitman would be nuts to tell you , and if he told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think those big guys make their moves ? They usually do it one on one , over a drink , or while going from the eighth green to the ninth tee . If any money has to change hands , it also is one on one , cash in an envelope which goes into a box at the bank . In Ridpath 's case I doubt even if money had to change hands . He was in the way , that was enough . And just in case he did have political ambitions , the best thing was to dump on him . You 'd like it very much if Quitman named names and you could take a good hefty cut at them evildoers . I can see that , Professor , " said Silky . " You and me , Al , we 'd never get anywhere with the politics . That 's why I 'm only a watcher . The hanky-panky is all going to be secret history , which nobody will ever write , not just because those guys are n't writers , but because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me , I deal professionally with deviants and socio/paths , like Quitman . They 'll confide in you , sometimes . But the secrets at the top in politics  --  never ! " " Oh , I wo n't be writing any expose , Silky . No scoops , " said Corde . " What will you be doing ? " " Personalities , scenes , backgrounds , feelings , tones , colors .. . Just between you and me , I would n't have been surprised if the strain of sixteen to eighteen hours a day in that place finally got to Ridpath . There must have been plenty of provocation , times when you 'd want to lay violent hands on somebody . " But Corde discoveredthat he was only speaking to himself . Quitman himself would not talk too much . He and Corde had sat silently for a time in the bright office , figuring each other out . The garden of red begonias was now taking the warmth of the sun and the knitted shawl showed its red and iridescent fleece . What did such people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously a quiet dean type , no Watergate investigator . Duringhis chat with Quitman , Corde remembered the close-mouthednessof G. O. O'Meara , whom he had interviewed at Meatcutters ' Hall just last week . O'Meara , about ninety years old , would n't give Corde the time of day . And there had been no talk of the knife or the sledgehammer , the shambles , nor of strikes , nor of scabs , nor of company police . O'Meara was now a public man emeritus . Feeble , not quite with it , he still cut a figure among the big shots of Chicago . Beautifully respectful to the old guy , almost filial , they telephoned him in his meatcutters ' palace . He went to board meetings , he attended banquets . There were testimonial plaques and scrolls and inscriptions on silver and bronze all over the place . The O'Meara who received the Dean was proud that he was a poet ; full time , now . He presented Corde with a book of his verses  --  love sonnets to his wife . Yes ! How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He made Corde listen to a poem he had recited on the jack Paar show . His breath was perfumed with the penny candy he sucked continually . There were jars of jujubes in front of him . Not one of Corde 's questions was answered , and when he got up to leave , the old man said to him , " Sop156you wanted me to talk , but I did n't tell you a thing , did I ? " AncientO'Meara , packed with guile , terribly pleased with himself ! Why should an important man in Chicago give information to any punk journalist who came along , calling himself a professor ? " They would n't let Ridpath be , " said Quitman . " There were five grand jury investigations . One was federal , because he handledgovernment money . There was nothing on him . " " But those people were persistent ? ... " " His big automobile is about his only valuable asset . Grand juriesbeing so easy to manipulate , it meant he was really clean . Somebody must 've been real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ridpath at first maintained an attitude of detachment , but presently became warmer . He seemed in the end to make Corde out to be some sort of delicate spirit . He could n't quite see what he was after , but he said at last , " I might be able to help if I understood what you wanted to do . " " I can send you my notes . They 're pretty full . If you have time to read them . " " Oh , plenty of time , " said Ridpath . They had been walking in a cold parking lot to Ridpath 's giant automobile . Ridpath put his key , first , not into the door , but into a lock installed in the fender , which turned off the alarm system . The Cordes also had an alarm system . At home their doors and windows were wired . Abruptly , Bucharest again  --  Minna burst into the room . All too plainly the news was bad . " They phoned me from the hospital . " " They , who ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . What she asked was , did I want them to light a candle . " " I see . " It was the end , then . A matter of hours . " I told her , Of course ! Please . " " Yes . Certainly you did . " " I did n't say anything to Gigi about this . You wo n't either , will you ? " " No . Im staying put right here , going nowhere anyway . " Minna wore the maroon or mulberry-colored jersey pants suit . She had lost so much weight that the belt had slipped from the tunic down low on her hips . She gave no sign that she wanted comfort from Corde . She was right to keep her balance in her own way . If he had put an arm about her shoulders it would have been more for his own sake than for hers . Anyway , she went out , again abruptly , as he was preparing to rise , so he sat down again with a sudden sense that the chair cushion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the same with the clothes in the armoire ; they hung there with the shapes she had given them . If he got into bed for warmth , it would be her bed . All this combined to keep him fixed  --  stalled . He considered what to do . There seemed nothing to do but what he had been doing . Perhaps more effectively . But what was there to be effective about ? He did n't have it in him to conceive how he might do better . He put his fingertips under his glasses and rubbed his eyes . His dependency on these goggles made him recognize how much he was organized for observationand comprehension . The organization , however , was insufficient . The present moment brought this home to him . And just now his thoughts took their shape from Valeria , just as the cushion under him and the clothing in the armoire did . Corde 's conjecture was that she was now unconscious . Vital signs must be diminishing , or the women would n't have lighted candles . Those must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxygen . Medicaltechnicians offering to light a candle  --  imagine ! And Minna , whose subject was astronomy , so badly wanting it . Please , do !  |p158Des|pite  the great weight of these conjectures , pictures , he leafed again through the papers spread over the desk . To resume : The notes he had sent to Ridpath had gone into his articles with little revision , in the end . He did n't care to develop them much . They were painful . His motive had been to avoid playing up to readers , making it all too easy for them to say , " You see how bad we 've become  --  all those appalling ghettos . " This was not what the Dean had really felt during the many days he spent in courtrooms and hospitals . Raising the indignationlevel  --  that easy satisfaction  --  was not his purpose . No , Dean Albert Corde , exercising his citizen 's right to see how justice was administered in his native city  --  he recorded exotic scenes in the courtrooms at Harrison and Kedzie . However , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own turf , which was also theirs , he found a wilderness wilder than the Guiana bush . The lawyers had let him sit in the front row with them . These were chicken-feed lawyers waiting for the Bench to assign them to a case . You could pick up a buck here . Some of these were elderly men , down on their luck . The younger ones were built like professional athletes , flashy dressers who went to hair stylists , not to barbers . Beautifullycombed , like pretty ladies or dear small boys in Cruikshank 's Dickens illustrations , they might have been either thugs or bouncers . Called up by the court clerk , groups of defendants and lawyers formed and dissolved all day long from endless dockets  --  dope pushers , gun toters ( everybody had a gun ) , child molesters , shoplifters , smackheads , purse snatchers , muggers , rapists , arsonists , wife beaters , car thieves , pimps bailing out their whores . People were all dressed up . Their glad rags were seldom clean . Young men wore high-waisted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; red-and-yellow wooden platform shoes , or Wild Bill Hickok dude boots ; or crisscrossed their shins with candy-box ribbons . They wore dashikis , ponchos , cloaks , African amulets , rings and beads  --  symbolic ornaments symbolizing nothing . There were brash strong women , subtle black small women who had little to say . Their skulls sometimes were terraced , very curious ; orp159else their hair was teased out , dyed , worked into small vipertanglebraids ; put up in blue , pink , yellow plastic rollers . For all this gaiety of color , the gloom was very deep . No one seemed able to explain what he had done , who he was . It was all : " You brought us here , you tell us who we are , and what you want with us . " Where did this gun come from ? It was lying on a shelf . Where ? In a burned-out abandoned house where somebody was selling liquor on a plank counter . How did you come to be there ? I du n no . You have before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in outline , male in dress , open-mouthed , mute , idiotic , frightened , too old to be a boy ( the hair is thin ) . The seat of his pants hangs down , full and dead , and his hands are lame at his sides . The bristles of his dewlaps are shaven in strips . He wears a turtleneck . His lawyer says he has no criminal record , Your Honor , never held a job but keeps house for his father and his brothers , factory workers . It 's a motherless household , Your Honor . Regarding the packages of Turns he put in his pockets at the supermarket , he pleads guilty , but it was just one of those once-in-a-lifetime things . The lawyer says , in effect , Look at this poor slob forty-year-old adolescent with these fat tits in a dirty jersey ; if you send him to County Jail they 'll tear him to bits . They 'll beat him , they 'll burn him with cigarettes for the fun of it , they 'll sodomize him day and night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him a scare and send him home . The judge nods , agrees and says , " What if I sentencedyou  --  do you know what they 'd do to you in jail ? " The next case is one of the sexual abuse of small children . Picturesare produced of screaming kids whose faces are spattered , covered with gobs of semen . Who would do this ? And who had t 1w presence of mind to take such pictures , waiting until the thing had been done ? Some undercover-agent photographer ? In his articles , the Dean had had much to say about these " whirling lives . " He was sorry now about that . He thought he had interrupted his accounts of County Jail , County Hospital and RobertTaylor Homes far too often with his unwanted and misplaced high-mindedness . On rereading , he himself passed quickly overp160the generalizing , philosophizing passages . They were irritating . He would n't , as a reader , have bothered to figure them out . Straight narrative was a relief and a consolation . " I go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ridpath , bareheaded , is wearing his gray-within-gray plaid coat . Men who knew him at CountyJail wave hello . There are snipers in the upper stories . Also , gangs are operating everywhere . ) " He introduces me to Mr. Jones , one of the building engineers in the maintenance department . Vandalism here runs to more than a million dollars a year , onethirdof the project 's operating budget . ' We had ninety commodes in the warehouse last month , now we are down to two . How do they break the commodes at such a rate ? Well , sir , being afraid to go at night to the incinerator drop on each floor , they flush their garbage down the toilet . The large bones stick in the pipes ; your plumber tries to snake them out , and there goes your bowl , cracked . Then there 're light bulbs . We do n't use glass anymore , we use unbreakable plastic . Children hold newspaper torches to them and they melt away . The elevators  --  those are the biggest headaches of all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's not just that people urinate in them .... ' " They commit assault , robbery , rape in them . " ' We have had young men getting on the top of the elevator cabs , opening the hatch and threatening to pour in gas , to douse people with gasoline and set them afire . Project guards , trapped like this , have had to surrender their guns . ' " Mr. Jones , black , a graduate of Tuskegee , is offered the protection of a pseudonym . His large sensitive eyes observe his fingertips on the edge of the desk as he speaks . Then he rearrangeshis documents . These are facts that should be known , and as Mr. Ridpath vouches for the Dean , Mr. Jones agrees to talk , but he does n't feel quite safe . Here in Eastern Europe , the morning 's rain had turned to snow . The flakes were large  --  their shapes made Corde think of contact lenses  --  but as soon as they touched the pavements it was all over for them . He turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of these were items culled from the pa/pers . Nine inmates of County Jail on November 25 sawed their way out of a segregated tier , handcuffed the guards , and then tried to climb down with a ladder of knotted bed sheets . Eight of them had been caught . The ninth , a man named Upshaw , escaped . This Upshaw had been confined to a state mental institutionbecause psychiatrists had found him incompetent to stand trial in the decapitation murders of a man and a woman and the strangling of their young daughter . Escaping from the " mental facility , " he livid been apprehended and sent to County . Now he was at large . Six of the eight who were caught had been facing murder charges . You see ( Corde saw ) , you begin to lose contact with human beingsand with the world . You experience spiritual loneliness . And of course there are the classics of this condition to study  --  or ratherto mull over : Dostoevsky 's apathy-with-intensity , and the rage for goodness so near to vileness and murderousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that . Then you tire of this preoccupation with the condition of being cut off and it seems better to go out and see at first hand the big manifestations of disorder and take a fresh reading from them . Not quite sufficient to say that at this moment of history the philosophical problemsare identical with the political ones . This is true . It 's okay . Only it 's insufficient . You had better go see in detail exactly what is happening . But there I go again , and never mind that now . He turned the pages of the magazine and found that his mother-inlawhad drawn double lines in the margins beside his account of the death of Gene Lewis at Twenty-sixth and California . Brought from jail to the Criminal Courts Building for sentencing , Lewis was heavily but carelessly guarded by the sheriff 's police , so that when his girl friend asked permission to give him a hook  --  to divert him ( the legal arguments would be long )  --  permissionwas granted , and she handed him a copy of Ivanhoe . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . As Lewis was handcuffed , the book was stuck under his arm . Corde had later been allowed to examine this copy of Ivanhoe . It was a boys ' edition , with colored , glossy illustrations . The inside had been carvedp162out with razor blades , but smoothly , a work of art , of love . The woman had been described by witnesses as " a high-style Twiggytypechick with three-inch artificial eyelashes , and orange dust all over her cheeks . She was very slender , about six feet tall , she wore long skinny boots and was gorgeous , out of this world . " Why should the armed guards , those Chicago payrollers , bother to open a book  --  any book ? Let the guy have his book . Once seated , Lewis snapped off the rubber bands under the defendant 's table . The woman had also put in a key . He unlocked the handcuffs and took out the magnum . He lined up all five beerbellies against the wall and disarmed them . He did n't shoot anyone , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a toy , he fired a single shot into the floor . Then he raced out of the courtroom . He dumped the guards ' guns in a trash basket and jumped into an elevator . But the elevator was going up , not down . When he rushed out to change on the next floor , he ran bang into a group of detectives from Area Four . They shot him ten times in the head . Paramedics from the Cermak Hospital came for the corpse with a black plastic bag . The woman was never identified . To look for her was a sheer waste of time . Students at the college had objected , predictably , to much that Corde had written . He had described broad-daylight rapes and robberies , sexual acts in public places , on the seats of CTA buses , on the floors of public waiting rooms , men on Sheridan Road spraying automobile fenders with their urine . So the students called a meeting to denounce the Dean for writing such things . Miss Porson had gone there , and sat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , afraid ( she might have been identifiedas a spy ) , and she was indignant . But the militant students did not matter much to Corde . He said to Miss Porson , " The usual thing , looking for an issue , trying to catch me out . And I brought it on myself for ' going public . ' But by next week I 'll be forgotten . " Miss Porson was wounded ( so deeply wounded , she said ) for his sake . They had misunderstood , they did n't know what a good man Mr. Corde was . If you could trust her sympathetic heart , the Dean was an angel . Well , you could n't trust her sympatheticp163heart  --  sorry , but she flattered him with all these flights of generouspassion ; she flattered herself , too , in her dramatic declarations . The Dean had his vanities . He could count the ways , if you asked . But he was not , if his observations were true , exceptionally vain . Besides , he had a thing about objectivity . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , and wear and tear reducedhim physically , they also revealed to him a strong preference for disinterested judgments . It was nothing like nonattachment , not  --  negative objectivity . He was objectivity ( no , impartiality ) intoxicated . The student militants , a small group now , revolutionary Marxists ( like the ones recently murdered in Greensboro by Klan and Nazi riflemen ) , passed a resolution declaringthat the Dean was a racist and that he owed a public apology " to Black , Puerto Rican and Mexican toilers " for making them look " like animals and savages . " Well , you wanted a lead apron and other protective devices when you approached all this dangerous stuff . It gave off deadly radiations and shocks of high voltage . It was n't as if Corde had been unaware of such dangers , either , as if he had come out of his ivory tower after ten years of seclusion unprepared , innocent , vulnerable , discovering what monstrous destruction the gods had unleashed . It was not like that at all . He had been getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminologists , the economists , the social theorists , the urban analysts , historians , yes , and the philosophers and poets  --  he was one of our contemporaries , after all , and a wide reader . Wider than most . But he thought he would say something about this Chicago scene drawing on his own experience , making fresh observations , referring to his own feelings , and using his own language . The steps by which he reached this decision were certainly peculiar . When you retraced them , they took you back to sources like Baudelaire and Rilke , even Montesquieu and Vico ; also Machiavelli ; also Plato . Yes , why not ? He had left the Paris Herald in order to give more attention to these great sources . Did he want to write about Chicago ? For once , it would be done in style . Without much success , he had tried to explain this to Minna.  |p164She  wished him well . Her own interests were mainly astronomical . He was saying to her at breakfast about a year ago that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted to her : " Everythingvisible flung into the boiling abysses to be melted down ... but hearts  --  should n't they have the power to hang suspended , to preserve themselves in a great cloud ? " Minna seemed to be interested in this . But you could n't be certain that you really had her attention . Still he continued . He said , " Rilke would n't discuss the war . He felt betrayed by his friends when they insisted on talking about it . Not just because the present was too brutal and too formless to be talked about , but because you could only talk about it in newspaper expressions . When you did that , he said , you felt disgust and horror at your own mouth . But then there was So-and-so , who said that you departed for the eternal only from Grand Central Station . This was in the day of the trains . What he meant , of course , is that the contemporary is your only point of departure . Hearts , sure , must have the power to hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Should n't ... " He stopped . The morning must have been ill-chosen . For Minna was astrophysically removed from him . The signs were too plain to miss . So he tested these truths of his against the blight of Chicago . By no means was it all blight . There was business Chicago sitting in its skyscrapers , monumental banking Chicago , corporate electroniccomputerized Chicago . There was historical Chicago , about which he wrote many curious things  --  speaking of the old neighborhoods , their atmosphere , their architecture , the trees , soil , water , the unexpectedly versatile light of the place . He surveyed the views of noteworthy visitors  --  Oscar Wilde , Rudyard Kipling , the famous Stead , whose book If Christ Came to Chicago contained vividand valuable pages . It was n't as if Corde had made a beeline for the blight . Nor did he write about it because of the opportunities it offered for romantic despair ; nor in a spirit of middle-class elegy or nostalgia . He was even aware that the population moving away from blighted areas had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fear that had made it move . Also , it was desolation that was left behind , endless square miles of ruin . Occasionally he had tried at the breakfast table before they went their separate ways to tell Minna what he was up to . " Rufus Ridpath wants to help out . He thinks it 's important . He sends me lists of people to talk to , and places that I should look at . " He should have known from the fixed look of his wife 's eyes not to talk to her now . Was he trying to challenge the stars ? She was concerned about her husband ( he was going into dangerous neighborhoods ) , but it would have been wiser to postpone this discussion . She took a sharp tone with him . She said , " It 's not a good idea to get in so deep with this Ridpath . You may look like two of a kind  --  out to get the establishment . " " Yes , he took a terrible beating . He 's burnt up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sympathize with him . His feeling for his people is real . Are they part of American society , or are they going to be eliminated from it ? To him this is not a theoretical question . I f as many as fifteen million people have already accepted to be stoned out of their minds  --  and it is n't only the junk use , but the anarchy , which is a sort of narcotic . And it is n't just that he knows this  --  he is it himself , humanly . " " And why is he helping you  --  because he likes you ? " " Maybe he does . And maybe he has naive respect for academic 's  --  thinksthey are what they 're supposed to be . Morality and justice is their trade . After all , there are libraries filled with marvelousbooks . " " Are you really talking about him , or about why you should take all this on ? " " Let me see if I can make it clear . " But that was absurd . He could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice . Something had come over him . He went over the passages marked by Valeria to see whether they formed a pattern . She would have been more interested in his emotions , his character , than in Chicago . There was , for instance , a long description of County Hospital.  |p166Dr  . Fulcher , the hospital 's Negro chief , had suggested thatCorde might find the kidney dialysis unit interesting . Valeria had heavily underlined his account of it . The ancient County Hospital , yellow , broad and squat . The surrounding neighborhoods have decayed and fallen down . In the plain of collapse , this mass stands almost alone . Beyond the clearings the giant forms of the business district are gathered close . Between the antennae of the Sears Tower a rotating light blinks out . The weather is gray . The pulsating signal is fluid , evidently made of metals and crystals whose names only engineersmight recognize . I am guided by a Filipino nurse through old tunnels , baked dry by mammoth boilers . The pipes drip rusty water . By the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dried blood would be scraped from them if there were staff enough , but there is no money . In these subterranean passages there are alternating zones of heat and chill . Paleotechnic furnaces hugely branching out send warmth up into the ancient wards . The tiny Filipino woman brings me to a room in which reclining chairs are covered with clean sheets . Beside each chair is a complicated device , glass within glass , the inmost compartment filled with blood . We stand and watch the purification process . Hooked into a machine , a large black man in worn work clothes is only semiconscious . The seaman 's watch cap has slipped from his head . His face is hairy , not bearded but unshaven , his big lips can not close even when he tries to speak . The small woman whispers to me . Kidney patients seldom sleep well , and while their blood is being cleansed they sometimes fall into a stupor . The process takes four hours to complete . Some of the patients , their kidneys destroyed by a variety of diseases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been extended for as long as ten years . Kidney patients look puffy . The legs and arms of the veterans are disfigured by surgically produced fistulas . Blood vessels are fused to increase circulation and these conjoined or grafted veins and arteries make great painful lumps which have to be soaked daily . A woman is now brought in who can no longer be treated through the arms or the legs . Her fistula is on the chest . The cabdriver who picks up and returns all these dialysis patients is an enormous black woman in red jersey trousers . Her feet seem quite small . Her shoes have high heels . Her straightened hairp167hangs to her shoulders . She wears a cabby 's cap and a quilted jacket . Solicitous , she supports the sufferer , settles her into her chair . These passenger-patients are her charges , her friends . She wheels forward the television set . The sick woman asks for Channel Two , and sighs and settles back and passes out . Some of the patients are bald from chemotherapy . One old man has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackness is an astonishing mole here and there on his naked head , a strange man to see but decent , sensible , and his thoughts in good order . A retired plumber by trade , nonunion , he still takes an occasional job . But then an even older man is brought in who looks altogether senseless . The guide whispers to me : " Dementia  --  notwith it . " They seat this old man , and he waits , his jaw undershot , and his head , from which the hair appears to have been scorched , is hanging forward . The technician who takes care of him is a Chinese woman . She works with beautiful skill , washing the lumpy arm with disinfectants , then plugging in the tubes , light and quick , no sign of pain from the old man . But then she blunders . A valve has been left open on the tray , and immediately everything is covered with blood . The suddennessof this silent appearance and the volume of blood with which the tray fills makes my heart go faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if my organs were melting like chocolate in hot weather . But the nurse , working under the blood , plugs the vent , stops the flow , gathers up the soaking napkins , spreads clean ones , wipes the tubes . This act of getting rid of the blood is performed with professional mastery , almost occult . I am astonished by the Chinese woman 's lightness and speed . As for the old man , he has noticed nothing . The Filipino nurse says , " You are a little pale . Do you want to go ? " As we walk away , she tells me about herself . She is a nun and belongs to a nursing order . It was n't just the blood . If it had been ordinary blood . But it was poisoned blood . It is said that these people pin their hopes on kidney transplants . But that will never happen . And these are dead men and women . The metabolic wastes obviously affect their brains . Nevertheless , these nurses and attendants are curiouslyemotional , extraordinarily tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifest a wonderful but also amorphous pity , a powerful but somehow indiscriminate love for these people.  |p168Dr  . Fulcher , County 's chief , wears a beige silk shirt of Oriental design , open at the throat , anything but negligent in style , and a fawn-colored suit . A big , graceful man , he is bald ; the white hairs of his sideburns are wonderfully trimmed . About his neck hangs a pear-shaped pendant of brownish onyx , and his fingers display large , intricate silver rings . He has a great sense of what it means to be at the top . Vividly articulate , he is in command here , he has a presence . Where white men would be diffident , he is exuberant , a regal populist in style . After all , he is at the head of this vast ( sinking ) institution , and he acts it . He is a great politician , he bears himself like an artist . No wonder Harper 's lost millions of dollars , printing this sort of stuff . So Dewey Spangler would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but he did n't answer , after all . The day was almost over , and he thought , I 've spent too much time over this stuff . Why do n't we go for a walk ? There 's still an hour of daylight . He said to Minna , " What about a breath of fresh air ? " But there were cousins expected at four . Gigi said , " Would n't you like a cup of the Twining 's tea you brought from Chicago ? " The thing happened for which , after all , they had come . Well , Corde said to himself , they were here to see Valeria  --  no ? Blunter , to see her off ? In spite of the Colonel , the purpose was achieved  --  no ? The hospital called while they were at breakfast next morning . Old Cousin Dincutza answered the telephone . Corde also came into the small parlor . The old woman stood stooping , holding her lowered head to the phone . She wagged her arm as if to forbid him to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , here it was , it had happened . She put down the instrument andp169said in a low voice , " Elie est morte . Valeria est morte ! " Then she hurried past him to the dining room , where he heard her reporting to the women . When he came in , Minna was looking sternly absentminded . She did not seem to need comfort from her husband . She had made her preparations for this . She said , " You were right , Albert . If we had n't gone that night I would never have seen her again . Just this morning I talked to Dr. Moldovanu . Mother died a little later , just before nine . " " I see . Well , what is there to do now ? I suppose you 've thought what to do . " " Yes , of course I have . Tonight is Christmas Eve . " " It is , is n't it . I 've lost track . " " We 'll try to set the funeral for the day after Christmas . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I discussed it with Ioanna last night . Petrescu came to the door just a while ago  --  before we sat down to breakfast . I talked to him for about five minutes . He already knew she was dead , I think . " " Petrescu ? " " He keeps in touch . He 's always been like this . He watches from a distance . He made some suggestions about what to do . " " What needs to be done ? Death certificate ? Undertaker ? I 'll make the rounds with you today . " " Petrescu gave me a number where I can reach him during the morning . And there 's Dincutza . Being over eighty , she knows a lot about such things . Whatever we have to do , cigarettes will make it easier . " " I must get more Kents . " " That 's what I meant . Traian will drive you over to the Intercontinental . But will you see what Gigi 's doing ? " Tanti Gigi was in the kitchen with Dincutza . Corde found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to go below to see Ioanna , to tell her that it had happened . The elevator was stuck . On the cold staircase he put a shawl over Gigi 's shoulders and helped her down to the concierge 's lodge . It did n't make much sense that Gigi should go to Ioanna , whose job it was to tellp170the police everything . But why should sense be made ? In the concierge'scavern , the two women sank to the small bed together , embracing and weeping in the alcove . Valeria 's photograph was on the night table , and on the wall were pictures of the dictator and his wife . Corde passed again through the lobby , where workmenwith hoes raised a dust , mixing cement for the cracked walls . He climbed back to the apartment . Minna , very thin and stern , staring past everyone , black beneath the eyes , was discussing detailsof the funeral with Dincutza . Traian had come upstairs . He sat slumped in a straight-backed chair by the door , buckled up in his fancy multi-zippered leather jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house of mourning . He was completely at Minna 's disposal . He had plenty of time for her . It was no simple matter to obtain a death certificate . First you had to go to the hospital . You needed releases , authorizations , any number of official papers . " We 'll have to drive all over town , " said Minna . Corde was grateful to this Traian with the Mexican wisps at the corners of his conspicuous lips . He had taken the whole day off , Minna said . After Christmas he would be available , too . More cigarettes were bought at the valuta shop . A pack or two of king-sized Kents saved dreary hours of waiting . From the Intercontinentalthey drove to the hospital , and after that to five or six government buildings  --  Corde , riding in the front seat of the Dacia , lost count . Traian knew what he was doing . Strange , what an expert he turned out to be . Traian in his leather cap and jacket , and his eyes like the green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He went to the head of the line . He presented himself at the desk boldly , making the essential signals , and putting down the cigarettes . He was a solid young man . His belly gave him more pull with gravitational forces than slighter people had , Corde thought . He took charge of all the papers . Minna paid the fees , signed the papers . She was firm , really very strong . Corde would never have guessed how strong she would turn out to be . She had no practical abilities , she had never needed them . Valeria had done all that . But now Valeria 's powers hadp171passed to her ( hitherto ) absentminded daughter . This is how she 'll attend to me , too , Corde thought . It was an entirely commonsensicalreflection ; it had n't the slightest emotional weight . By early afternoon all the necessary documents had been collected . In record time , Corde would have said . Traian drove to the crematorium through a freezing rain . Workers ' housing blocks and government buildings were covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five stories tall , flapped and floated in gusts of rain . This must have been his way of resisting Christmas sentiment . He interposed himself . Then the crematorium , standing on a hilltop , a huge domed building . Just as you would expect , the grounds were planted with small cypresses . Flanking the doors there were bas-relief figures of Graces in mourning , part Puvis de Chavannes , part socialist realism . Here as elsewhere , Traian seemed to know just what to do . Corde and Minna followed him to the desk ( there was no office ) , where they began to make arrangements with the managing comrade . This man was dressed for the chill of the enormous circular place . He wore sweaters , shawls , an overcoat , an astrakhan hat . The astrakhan was a phony . He was not at all difficult , this official , not gloomy in the least , in fact he was more than normally cheerful , sociable  --  he was gabby . The paper work was done by his assistant , a young woman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to keep the body warm , the effect of double metabolism , or so Corde had heard . Anyway , she appearedunaffected by the cold  --  she alone . There was a green Nurembergstove , but the comrade manager had it all to himself . Another mourner had already come up behind Corde . His coat was buttoned tightly across his belly ; he was a stout man , very big , with a red , blustering face , but that was probably an effect of grief aggravated by the terrible cold . His blue bubble eyes were fixed on the tile stove . He reached over Corde 's shoulders , trying to warm his distorted large fingers . Meantime the seated comrade manager was receiving slips of paper from his assistant and using two kinds of mucilage to stick them to the documents  --  documentsupon documents  --  and talking nonstop . He asked whetherp172a priest would perform a service . Priest ? Minna turned to Corde . No priest . Valeria was religious but there would be prayers at the cemetery when her ashes were placed in the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then did the family want music ? There were two choices , the Chopin funeral march or , equally appropriate , Beethoven  --  the slow movement from the Third Symphony . Four minutes on tape . Minna chose the Beethoven . The astrakhan hat nodded and nodded , writing on diligently , holding the pen in his thumb and two middle fingers , the index pointing forward , riding above the papers . Next , very courteous , anticipating baksheesh from the American husband , he led the way to the center of the hall . This was where services were held . There were two single files of chairs for the principal mourners . Under the center of the dome , in icy gloom , was something that resembled a long metal barrel . It opened longitudinally . This was the bier . When the halves of the barrel closed , the body was mechanicallylowered for cremation  --  same mechanism in double action . In this one spot , heat rose from below . Corde and Minna drew away from it . There were flowers here , all cyclamens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The plants had been placed on the floor . Here they thrived like anything  --  low temperatures ; just what they wanted . Above them , square containers of ashes were stacked like canisters of Twining 's tea . Each carried a photograph , and dates of birth and death , and an appropriate legend : " Militant , " " Engineer , " " Teacher . " So many contemporary faces , like pedestrians snapped by a sidewalk photographer . These must have been victims of the earthquake . Witnesses said that tall new buildings had turned to powder as they collapsed . But why were these tea boxes still here ? Because there was no consecrated ground prepared for them ? Traian explained this to Minna . The regime was short of cemeteries . Graves were at a premium . But why should there be such congestion  --  was n't there plenty of land beyond the suburbs ? Trembling Dincutza had spoken of this at home . She criticized no one , of course . She only said that Valeria had bought graves in the year of Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had raised the granite monument and built two benches . She owned several other plots as well . One had been promised to Engineer Rioschi , who used to drive her quite often to the cemetery to tend the Doctor 's grave . Dincutza stated shrilly ( sometimes this kind old woman resembled Picasso 's horse in Guernica ) , " Nous savons combien elle aimait son marl . " Rioschi , you understand , did n't want to be stacked with these other cans in the crematorium when his time came , so he had been glad to drive Valeria . That had been their deal . He was a single man , you see . The gray astrakhan now moved more quickly before them . Corde assumed that he was leading them to a chapel of some sort , a place where friends could view the body before the service . But no such thing . He brought them into a curved corridor where there were curtained recesses , tall and dim . Then Corde was astonished to see a pair of shoes sticking through the green-tinted transparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feet of a corpse . Next were a woman 's feet , in high heels . In these cold recesses or cribs , corpses were laid out in their best clothes . Each one lay just visible in a shallow coffin shaped like a small punt and lined with dimity stuff , not much more than cheesecloth or insect netting . One tall corpse with a black Balkan mustache had his homburg set beside his head . He clasped his briefcase to his chest . Lord , I am ignorant and a stranger to my fellow man . I had thought that I understood things pretty well . Not so . The comrade manager said that he had wanted to show Minna where Valeria might be brought from the hospital next day . " No , thank you , no , " said Minna . The hour for the service was fixed for ten o'clock on the morningof the twenty-sixth . The funeral parlor was next . Coordination was the problem  --  the hearse to be sent to the hospital , the body to be ready for it . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls . They were only half-coffins , really , lidless . An elderly workman had one on his trestle , tacking in the flimsy two-threadp174lining . Careful tucks made a simple ruffle along the top . Backed up against the tall tile stove , the place of privilege , an obese old woman in multiple sweaters and a circular fur hat repeated the order hoarsely as she wrote it out . The wisps of her hat matched the hairs of her whiskers . Her lips worked inwards continually . She was not chewing ; she had no teeth . She seemed to be tasting her own mouth . She ordered the men about , growling and bullying , but she became happy when Minna paid her off and Traian gave her two packages of American cigarettes . As she shoved the money into the drawer she simultaneously heaved up her clumsy body to reach for the Kents . Corde said , " Do we go home now ? " " Yes , there 's nothing else to do today , except to see if I can place an announcement in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have to choose Valeria 's clothes for the funeral . Traian will take them to the hospital . " They steered back through the freezing streets . The only heat he had felt all day came from under the bier . Yesterday he had suggested to Minna that they go out for fresh air . Now he wanted only to get back to his room . Returning , they found the dining room table surrounded by old cousins . They came with small presents for the mourners . Gigi , wearing a black dress , was unwrapping cakes and bottles at the buffet . The cakes , like the old ladies who had baked them , were dimly spicy . Gigi told Corde , " You had two calls , one from overseas  --  Ithink your college in Chicago . They said they would call again . " And the other ? Dewey Spangler , thought Corde , reporting on his efforts with the White House . He did not linger among the cousins . He felt used up ; the round of offices , the crematorium , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of French conversation was too much for him . The cousins did n't really want to talk to him , anyway ; they were only being polite . This was no time to swap French phrases . He went to his refuge , his sanctuary , his cell . He had his private bottle there , and his bed ; the flowers also . Towards the flowers he felt slightly negative now , as if they had betrayed him by bloom/ing at the crematorium . An effort of reconciliation might be necessary . The irrationality of this did not disturb him . If this was how he was , this was how he was . The telephone rang and Minna looked in and said , " For you , my dear . " He picked up the instrument . " Albert ? It 's Dewey . So far , no luck with those , Georgia yokels . I can keep trying .... " " Thanks , Dewey . No point now .... " " Oh ? Sorry . When did she pass away ? " " Early this morning . Funeral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to keep our date , " said Dewey . " I 'd under-stand . " " When are you leaving ? " " Evening of the twenty-sixth . " " Why not the same afternoon  --  after the funeral ? I probably wo n't be needed then . There 'll be lots of callers . " " Yes , that makes good sense . Not a bad idea to get away for a while and have a drink . It must all be completely foreign . " " Not completely . " " Not insofar as you liked that old woman . " " I did , yes . " " Foreign  --  I mean , to be an American in a foreign family . That I call an unusual experience . You did n't tell me that Minna 's motherhad been a friend of Ana Pauker , and knew Thorez and Tito . I found this out yesterday from an old-timer . He told me about her and that whole Stalinist generation . " " These people were no Stalinists . They were just unpolitical people who got into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't scent a story in Valeria . After all , he owed his syndicate two columns a week . " How is your wife taking it ? " said Dewey . " At the moment she 's busy with arrangements . Doing fine . " " Yes , " said Dewey . " It tends to hit one later . " " I 've often heard that said . " " Poor girl . Say , before I forget , there 's no news out of Chicago about your case . Unless you 've heard from other sources . "  | " It 's the holiday lull . Jurors would raise hell if they did n't get their Christmas . " " Well , Albert , I 'll check back to see if it 's convenient , after the funeral . I 'm pretty busy here , but there 's always a sort of gap beforeairport time . " Hanging up , Corde glanced into the dining room but did n't show himself . There were bowls of eggplant salad on the table . Dinner would be late , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat here . Leftovers . But in the West everybody ate altogethertoo much and sometimes he imagined that overfeeding made people toxic , slowed their thinking . He was trying to account for the recent increase in his own mental acuity . It now seemed to him that he was thinking more clearly here . Evidently fasting and disruption of routine were beneficial . But if his ideas were more clear they were also much more singular . For example : Valeria was certainly dead . She had died , and she was dead , and last arrangements were being made . But he could n't say that she was dead to him . It would n't have been an accurate statement . One might call this a comforting illusion , a common form of weakness , but in fact there was nothing at all comforting about it , he could take no comfort in it . Nor was it anything resembling an illusion . It was more like an internal fact of which he became conscious . He had n't been looking for it . And he was not promptedto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this sort left him cold . He owed it nothing . It was particularity that interested him .... Again the phone sounded off , and Corde picked it up . He had a hunch that it would be Chicago , and he did n't want Minna to take it . He was right . The Provost was calling . " I wish you a Merry Christmas . " He inquired how they were . Ah , bad ! Very sorry indeedto hear the news . He asked to have his sincerest condolences conveyed . Corde rumbled , " Thanks . Very thoughtful of you , Alec . " One of the shrewdest operators that ever lived , the Provost was also very strong  --  the perfect , up-to-date American strongman . You felt his muscle the instant you engaged him . No one wasp177more smooth , more plausible , long-headed , low-keyed than Witt . A man of masterly politeness , ultra-considerate , he had decided ( elected in cold blood ) to adopt the mild role . That was all right with Corde , by and large . Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accommodate his needs , if he could , but he was beginning to find the Provost 's highly perfected manner hard to take , especially hard since the onset of the troubles . " I would so like to express my deepest sympathy to Minna . Is she there ? I am so sorry to hear about her mother .... " " I 'm letting her sleep , " said Corde . " Ah , she must need the rest , poor thing . " Minna 's high standing , her academic importance , shielded Corde from the Provost . He had never really grasped that , but he understood it fully now . " I do n't suppose there is any way to wire flowers to Eastern Europe , " said the Provost . " There may be ; you can find out more easily at your end than I can here . " " Oh , for gosh sakes , I would n't dream of troubling you with that , Albert . You must have your hands full . " " Is there anything new on the legal side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard that you were subpoenaedby your cousin . " " Is that so ? " " Mr. Detillion wanted to put you on the stand to establish the heavy involvement of the college in this case . I 've checked into that with our legal department .... " " With some real lawyers ... " " Oh , there 's no comparison , " said the Provost . " I do n't want to downgrade your cousin ; you may have residual sentiments about him . But these are crack lawyers . Of course , you 'd never have to get on the stand . The matter was gone into with the State 's Attorney . But the newspapers gave the subpoena some play , which was what your cousin wanted . How come all the French names in your family , Albert ? " " The family explanation is that we were leftovers of the LouisianaPurchase . Napoleon sold us all to Thomas Jefferson so that hep178could pay for his invasion of Russia .... Well , I 'm sorry to be a cause of so much trouble to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no real trouble , just silliness . " Witt would concede him nothing . The likes of you can make us no trouble , was what he was saying . There was nevertheless real bitterness , and Corde could feel it . It came down from the communicationssatellite perfectly clear , pellucid . Corde was in an odd condition anyway , one that made it possible for him to see the Provost from all sides  --  the jut of his upper teeth , the gill-like creases under the ears , the continual play of deference and kindliness , command , pressure , threat  --  back and forth . No , he did n't like Corde . The Dean 's appointment had been a mistake , and it was the Provost 's job to clear up the mess . Corde was an outsider , he had n't come up from the academic ranks , had n't been shaped by the Ph.D . process . It was n't even clear why he had wanted to become an academic , and even an administrator . The Provost was still speaking . " Our people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since you 're out of the country and ca n't be served , it 's all in fun . " " And my nephew ? " " He came in , surrendered , and your sister posted a bond , so the young man is out . The grand jury 's indictment probably wo n't stick , when it 's reviewed , because the boy did n't have a preliminaryhearing . But all the prosecution wanted was to establish that he had threatened the witnesses , which I 'm afraid he really did . " " I doubt that he fired a pistol at them . " " Your guess is better than mine . " " Because I 'm his uncle ? " " Oh , no , " said Witt , suave again . " We ca n't be responsible for our relatives ; we do n't choose them . " " Only I seem to have more bad relatives than the normal person . " " We 'll work it out , believe me , " said the Provost . Witt had from the first found it necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructing him , making certain that he would interpret budgetary , educational , institutional policies ap/propriately . But ( it was Corde himself saying all this for him ) there was something unteachable about the Dean , an emotional block , a problem , a fatum . One of the permanent human problems , in every age of mankind ( Corde saw it now ) , was the problem of not being a fool . This was truly terrible . Oh , that oppression , that fool-fear : It pierced your nose , blinded your eyes , split your heart with shame . And to Witt , a man of power , Corde was a fool . To conceal such an opinion was an operational necessity for a Witt . It was the sort of sacrifice ( a sacrifice , not to let your opinion dart forth , and scream and mock ) you had to make if you were to be a genuine administrator . That sort of thing you had to hold down . But then there was Witt 's brutal infrastructure , which ould not be covered up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him know , to transmit by his perfected devices , what a fuckingfool he was . The Dean had made Witt very angry . He had bollixed everything up with his muddled high seriousness . It was not so much the Lester case that angered the Provost . The real vexation was that he had published those magazine articles without a clearance from the college . Not to submit them for approval was out of line , unheard of , dangerous to the last degree  --  wild ! Corde had attacked  --  whom had n't he attacked : politicians , businessmen , the professions , and he had even loused up the Governor . Maybe suggestions had come to Witt from high places , by discreetest channels , that this was one highly expendable dean . lior his part , Corde did n't want to hide behind Minna . But Minna was involved . For Witt there was a delicate tactical problem . But the Provost , Corde believed , took professional satisfaction in his maneuvers , in operations calling for an unusual degree of skill. f ie heard the Provost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we could n't have backed away from this case , it had to be followed up . I authorized the reward , you remember . " Corde did remember that . But he recalled also how plainly the Provost was put off by the Dean 's emotionalism , his flushed face , his swollen eyes . " What verdict does the legal department predict ? " Corde was asking , really , how the college hoped to come out of the case.  | " Not pushing for a death sentence . " " I never had that in mind . " " Yes , " " said Witt . " You expressed your views in Harper 's clearly enough . Capital punishment  --  according to you , nobody 's hands are clean enough to throw the switch . What was your expression ? Oh , yes , ' the official brutes ' ... " What Corde had had in mind ... as if the Provost cared what position Corde had taken . Witt despised him . Nor , to tell the whole truth , did Corde altogether blame him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had been out of kilter when he wrote those articles . Dewey Spangler was right , in part . There was a sort of anarchy in the feelings with which those sketches were infused , an uncontrolled flow of " poetry , " the truth-passion he had taken into his veins as an adolescent . Those sketches were raw , where was the control of deeper experience ? There was n't any . He had publicly given himself the fool test and he had flunked it . And now came a man like Alec Witt , Witt who represented power , qualified by the higher deviousness , as power usually was . Corde had challenged this " real-world " power without reflective preparation , without taking account of the higher deviousness . He had left himself wide open . And today of all days  --  Valeria lying in the hospital morgue !  --  this depressed the Dean fiercely . But oddly enough , when the wave of depression returned from its far low-down horizon it brought back the idea of having another go at the thing . Do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the free world in orderto discuss capital punishment with a high-principled idiot dean . Both parties now made a pause . Witt was about to disclose the true reason for his call . The deep Atlantic stream brimmed between them . They were  --  what  --  seven thousand miles apart ? You were n't able to have conversations like this in the old days . " When do you plan to be back ? " " For the new semester . Minna will have to settle up her mother'saffairs  --  the estate , such as it is . She also needs to get to Mount Palomar ; she missed her telescope days . " " You have n't seen Vlada Voynich yet ? " said the Provost.  | " We 've been expecting her . Her brother said she 'd be here for Christmas . " " She 's been telling what an interest you 've developed in Beech 's work . " " Purely amateur , " " said Corde . " Of course it would be . In the nature of the case . Are you planning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bass voice answered , " That was Beech 's idea  --  he proposed it . He sent me the material . " " That 's what Vlada told me . You have n't decided yet , though , have you ? " " It has n't been on my mind much . I 've put off thinking about it . I would n't want to jump into anything . If there 's going to be more controversy ... I need to be sure I 've got a good grasp of the facts . " This should have reassured the Provost somewhat . Instead it made him press a little harder . " These environmental , ecological questions are very complex . " " I would n't do it if it were only that . I do n't care to get mixed up in environmentalism . But I am interested in Beech himself . The personality of a scientist , his view of the modern world . But I 'll have to wait until Minna 's able to discuss it . I ca n't take it up with her now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bringingmore material . " " So she told me , and I asked her also to give you copies of letters .... " " What sort of letters ? " " Things that have come in  --  in connection with those Harper 's pieces of yours . " " What , complaints to the college , objections ? " " Nothing to disturb you . Lots of curious items . Amazing how worked up people can become and what a variety of responses one can get . You 'll find them really thought-provoking . I would n't think of upsetting you at a time like this . And you do n't ni d to worry about things here ; they 're under control . I keep a ' , Ireful eye on Lydia Lester . She was splendid on the witnessp182stand . But you saw that yourself . So fragile , and turned out to have real guts . " Each of the Provost 's final words touched an anxiety in Corde . " It wo n't be a happy Christmas for poor Minna . Tell her at least that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mount Palomar . We 'll be looking for you after the first of the year . " Corde explained to Minna under the dim chandelier of the diningroom table  --  the taped black wires hung twisted from the broken plaster . " Alec Witt . Merry Christmas , and condolences . Do n't worry about the telescope . And Vlada Voynich is on her way . " Gigi served an early dinner . It was eaten listlessly . For ChristmasEve the table had been laid with linens embroidered in red . Corde went to bed early . The twenty-fourth of December had lasted long enough . On Christmas morning there were presents beside their coffee cups . The old girls saved gift-wrapping paper and ribbons from year to year . There were treasures of all kinds in the cupboards , boxes of pre-Communist ornaments . Gigi brought to the table the Christmas angels Minna remembered from childhood . They were designed to float slowly on wires radiating from a disk set in motionby the heat of a small candle . The toy would not work . " Valeria always could make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mourning and her neck was strained as she bent to strike more matches . She had combed out the bobbed hair but at the back it still looked like a hayrick . " It may be the candles , " she said . She went through the drawers of the buffet , looking for the right kind . She did n't know where Valeria had put them . Corde tinkeredwith the wires . Americans were supposed to be mechanicallygifted , but he could get nowhere with them . He only bent the toy badly . The four angels hung motionless . That was the end of them . Valeria had taken their secret with her . " Then open your presents , " said Gigi . She had given Minna a peasant blouse . For Corde there was a large gold pocket watch which had belonged to Dr. Raresh . Surprised , he stared at it  --  graceful numerals , a shapely swell to the tip of the hour hand . Top183set it you depressed a tiny catch with your thumbnail . Gigi said , " This was the present Valeria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into the pocket of his cardigan and as he bent to sip his coffee he felt the pull of the golden lump near his waist . He reckoned that after London , and especially after the Rowlandson exhibition and dinner at the Etoile , Valeria had accepted him as a full member of the family . When he had tried to take her by the elbow because she was listing , could no longer keep her balance , when she pulled her arm away , it had depressed him ( something like the streak of a black grease pencil over his feelings ) ; he felt that she was irritated with him . But that had n't been what it meant . On the contrary , it was then that his probation had ended . The morning was sunny . He studied the watch at length in the bedroom . He read Vollard 's memoirs and reminiscences of painters  --  noboards , no back , nothing but a bundle of stitched paper . Minna had no time for him . She and Gigi spent most of the morningdeciding how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred , or shoes , or blouse or ornaments ? They decided that she should wear a greeny-blue silk suit Minna had bought in London for her , and a green and black paisley scarf , dark blue shoes . Traian took the clothing to the hospital , together with a photograph to show how Valeria put up her hair . Gigi , who had been so passive while Valeria was dying , turned assertive and militant , insisting that the government must be " forced " to give her sister a public funeral . She told this to Petrescu when he turned up on Christmas Day . Petrescu surprised Corde by the genuineness of his grief . He carried himself ( his swooping belly , his wide undercurves ) with soldierly decorum but his eyes were red , tragic pouches under them . He was indulgentwith Gigi , he sat sighing and let her talk . She told him ( defyingthe listening devices ) that the least the government could do was to acknowledge the fidelity of Dr. Raresh to the Party and the Revolution and the contributions made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronomy . He answered patiently , his voice rising in spirals until it broke in the higher registers . Minna said to Corde how decent of him it was to come , and how loyal hep184was to the family . " I think he had no personal secrets from my mother . " Bound to have secrets , in his racket : Corde silently dissented . However , Petrescu 's face certainly was ruined . If intensive care doctors could light candles for the dying , secret agents could mourn their adoptive mothers . There was sentiment all over the place . Petrescu had his family side , his soft side . He was delicately , even endearingly attentive to the ladies . He was thoughtful towardsCorde , too , and brought him two green bottles of Chenin Blanc , unobtainable except in the commissaries for high-ranking bureaucrats . Gigi explained to Corde what she was doing . " I am insisting that my sister should not have a commonplace funeral . She ought to be exposed publicly in the great lobby of the Medical School , as her husband was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give her official recognition . " " Will they give it ? " " We shall insist . I am requesting Mihai Petrescu to approach old members of the Politburo . They remember her . They are aware , as younger ones are not . There was typhus . There was starvation . Valeria asked Truman for supplies . He sent them . The Russians put their own labels on . Requesting drugs and food from America was one of her crimes . " Minna agreed with her aunt , while Corde was thinking that you saw eyes like his wife 's in famine photographs . She was starving herself . It would take months to restore her . " If not the lobby of the Medical School , then the Memorial Hall next door to the crematorium , " said Gigi . Petrescu , downcast , much troubled , nodding , stroked the fuzz of his fedora , stroked the dense hairs growing from his ears . In spite of its wide bottom , his broad body sat uncomfortably . He often pressed his palm over the thin hairs streaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His pouchy eyes occasionally were lifted to carry silent messages to Corde , to anotherman . These poor women were innocent ... they did n't know , could n't understand . Corde believed that Petrescu had tried top185make a stand against the Colonel , had been beaten quickly , clobbered , forced to back off . Now , after Valeria 's death , he may have gotten official permission to be helpful to the family . Petrescu 's rank in the security forces must have been fairly high . Whatever he had to do in the line of duty ( do n't ask ! ) he atoned for in this household by services , by emotional deeds , tender attachments . He was an old-consciousness type in a new-consciousness line of business . Gigi declared , " I assure you , Albert , and I will even swear , that my sister shall have her due . Until now my sister , who was a figure in the history of our country , has been denied notice in the national encyclopedia . But she shall have it . I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Corde , " Today I ca n't even get the newspapers to print a notice of the funeral . " " Why do you suppose . . . ? " " The obvious reasons . I ran away from them . And my mother was expelled , then refused to rejoin the Party . I think the funeral will be well attended , though . Just word of mouth . The telephone does n't stop ringing . My mother is a symbol .... " " Of what ? " Minna whispered . " It is n't political , it 's just the way life has to be lived , it 's just people humanly disaffected . " She covered his ear with cupped hands and said , " The government may be afraid of a demonstration at the Medical School . " Corde , who did n't believe this for a moment , nodded . He said , " Sure . I understand . But what would the demonstration be ? " " I told you . It would be sentiment . To approve what Valeria personally stood for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rest for a while , my dear . You 're tired . This is hard on you . I can see . Vlada is coming later . She arrived this morning . " A clear Christmas Day . The room was surprisingly warm , the sun heating the windows . It made him feel how badly he needed a breather , " a few minutes of Paris , " as he called it  --  some civilizedcalme , or luxe . He picked up the crumbling paperbound Vollard , his Souvenirs d'un Marchand de Tableaux , and read a few paragraphsabout the testiness of Degas . " You 'll see , Vollard , they'llp186raid the museums for Raphaels and Rembrandts and show them in the barracks and the prisons on the pretext that everybody has a right to beauty ! " A crabby old bigot , and he looked so ferociouslyat a child who annoyed him in a restaurant that he scared the little girl into fits and she vomited on the table . But for this nastinesshe gave full compensation in lovely painting and bronze . Whereas a fellow like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius-monster , he was only . . . And Corde now tried to protect his sunlit breather , the moment of peace , but he could not beat off Alec Witt and he presently surrendered to Chicago thoughts . The Provost 's signal was easy to read : for the sake of the college , he was protecting Beech . Scientists were far too naive to protect themselves , and Corde was especially dangerous because he , too , was in a way an ingenu . Once a man like Witt decided that you were not a man to observe the discreet convention , that you talked out of turn , and that you were a fool , nothing but trouble , you were out . He would do everything possible to stop Corde from writing a piece on Beech  --  " one of those pieces of his . " And you could n't altogether blame the guy , thought Corde . It 's true , I was carried away . Hearts hanging in the dark too long , and going bad , spoiling in suspension , and then having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hold with Dewey , he 's too psychoanalytical , but he 's clever enough in his own way or he would n't have become such an eminence . Give him his due . And he says I was settling scores with Chicago . I must admit that I was retaliatingon my brother-in-law , on Max Detillion and on many another . Tired of false opinions , and of his own distortions most of all , Corde admitted that , yes , he had wanted to give it to them ( to a generalized Chicago ) , to stick it to them . To stick it , and to make it stick so that they could n't shake it off . Now , a man in a position of real responsibility , a Witt , for instance , he protects his institution from everything immoderate . That 's how the silky style is justified . That 's his method for dealing with disruption : never lose your cool with the disrupter , gag him with silk , tie him in knots with procedures . Corde would class that as one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign that I was going to turnp187disruptive . Dumb thoughtful sweet , was my  --  type , mulling things over . Then I turned out to be one of those excessive , no-innergyroscopefellows he ca n't stand . So he despises me ; what of it ? I detest him , too . That 's neither here nor there . The publication of his articles had also given Corde a profile of the country , a measure of its political opinions , a sample of its feelings . " I administered my own Rorschach test to the U.S. , " Corde said . Before leaving Chicago he had already received a batch of letters forwarded by the editors of Harper 's . " A flood of mail , " one of the assistants wrote . Liberals found him reactionary . Conservatives called him crazy . Professional urbanologists said he was hasty . " Things have always been like this in American cities , ugly and terrifying . Mr. Corde should have prepared himself by reading some history . " " The author is a Brahmin . The Brahmins taught us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Corde believes in gemutlichkeit more than in public welfare . And what makes him think that what it takes to save little black kids is to get them to read Shakespeare ? Next he will suggest that we teach them Demosthenes and make speeches in Greek . The answer to juvenile crime is not in King Lear or Macbeth . " " The Dean 's opinion is that a moral revolution is required . His only heroes are two self-appointed possibly dubious benefactors . " " You should be congratulated for opening up these lower depths of psychology to your readers , giving us an opportunity to look into the abysses of chaotic thinking , of anarchy and psycho-pathology . " Curious what people will pick on . About Macbeth Corde had only noted that in a class of black schoolchildren taught by a teacher " brave enough to ignore instructions from downtown , " Shakespeare caused great excitement . The lines " And pity , like a naked newborn babe , Striding the blast " had pierced those pupils . You could see the power of the babe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps only poetry had the strength " to rival the attractions of narcotics , the magnetism of TV , the excitements of sex , or the ecstasies of destruction . " It was certainly true that Corde had found himself in Chicagop188looking for examples of " moral initiative , " and he had come up with two : Rufus Ridpath at County Jail ; and Toby Winthrop , also black , an ex-hit man and heroin addict . He had n't found his examplesin any of the great universities , and there was a large academicpopulation in Chicago . What Alec Witt probably would like to know was why Corde had n't made his search for moral initiativein his own college . Why , thought Corde , I did look there , up and down , from end to end . Corde was not a subversive , no fifth columnist , nor had he become a professor with the secret motive of writing an expose . He had n't been joking when he quoted Miltonto his sister Elfrida : " How charming is divine philosophy "  --  the mosaic motto on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were where philosophy lived , or was supposed to be living . He had never forgotten the long , charmed years in a silent Dartmouth attic , where he had read Plato and Thucydides , Shakespeare . Was n't it because of this Dartmouth reading that he gave up the Trib and came back from Europe ? To continue his education , he said , after a twenty-year interruption by " news , " by currenthuman business . It was Ridpath who had sent Corde to Toby Winthrop at OperationContact . He drove to the South Side on a winter day streaky with snow . You could see the soot mingling with the drizzle . Corde had n't come to this neighborhood in thirty years . It was then already decaying , now it was fully rotted . Only a few old brick bungalows remained , and a factory here and there . The expresswayhad cut across the east-west streets . The one remaining landmark was the abandoned Englewood Station  --  huge blocks of sandstone set deep , deep in the street , a kind of mortuary isolation , no travelers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the empty lots , and black men keeping warm at oil-drum bonfires . All this  --  low sky , wind , weed skeletons , ruin  --  went to Corde 's nerves , his " Chicago wiring system , " with peculiar effect . He found Operation Contact in a hidden half-block ( ideal for muggings ) between a warehouse and the expressway . Except on business , to make a sale , who would come to this place ? He parked and got out of the car feeling the lack of almost everythingp189you needed , humanly . Christ , the human curve had sunk down to base level , had gone beneath it . If there was another world , this was the time for it to show itself . The visible one did n't bear looking at . Well , Corde entered the " detoxification center " and climbed the stairs . Two landings , a wired-glass door where you showed your face and were buzzed in . You found yourself in a corridor , and then , unexpectedly , you came into a room furnished with umber and orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he met someone who encouraged him , a wiry , whiskery Negro who said , " Go on , man  --  go , go ; you on the right track . " The tentative , pale , blundering Dean amused him . Winthrop 's office window was heavily covered in flowered drapes of pink and green . The ex-hit man sat waiting for him . His trunk was enormous , his thighs were huge , his fingers thick . No business suit for him . He was dressed in matching shades of brown  --  a knitted shirt in beige , a caramel-colored suede jacket , chocolate trousers , tan cowboy boots . He wore a small brown cap with a visor , a boy 's cap . His face curved inward like a saddle . He was bearded and , like Dr. Fulcher at County Hospital , he had pendantson his neck and big rings on his hands . He picked up the note Corde had sent him . In the lamplight the folded paper seemed no bigger than a white cabbage moth . " You a friend of Rufus Ridpath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thinks we can do each other some good . Maybe he thinks you might be able to do something for him . Set the record straight . " " What do you think ? " " I think he was the best warden County ever had , and I was a prisoner before and during his time .... " The body of this powerful man was significantly composed in the executive leather chair . If you had met him in the days when he was a paid executioner , if he had been waiting for you on a staircase , in an alley , you would never have escaped him . He would have killed you , easy . " You ca n't do much for Ridpath . The guys who did the job on him do n't have to worry about you or me , my friend . It 's theirp190town . Their names are in the paper every day . No trouble at all to get names . But that 's all you could get . Rufus does n't really expect anything from you . He just likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " " He said that you and your friend Smithers founded this center to cure addiction without methadone , as you cured yourself . " This man with the black nostrils , impressively staring under the visor of the childish cap , interrupted him . He said , " You bein ' polite . He said I was a hit man , right ? I was , too , a hired killer working for very important people in this city . I was tried three times for murder . Those important people got me off . Ask me how , and I identify you as a man who do n't know this town . " How many people he had murdered , he did n't care to say . But then he nearly killed himself with an overdose of heroin . Someoneshould have warned him how strong it was . After he took it he recognized it for what it was . As it began to take effect , he saw that he was dying . This happened in a hotel room near Sixty-third and Stony Island , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woodlawn . " I 'm goin ' to tell you just a little about this . " A friend came and put him into a tub of cold water , but he saw that Toby was dying and he beat it . " No use hangin ' around . But after eighteen hours of death , I came back . " He lifted himself from the tub , and just as he was , in wet clothes , he went down into Sixty-third Street and caught a cab to Billings Hospital , to the detoxification unit . Because of his terrifyinglooks , the receptionist signaled the police , who grabbed him in the lobby . But they had nothing to hold him on at the station , only vagrancy and loitering . " I bailed myself out . Always a big bankroll in my pocket . I got another cab back to Billings , but this time I stopped in an empty lot and tore the leg off a table . I went in with it under my coat , and I showed it to the receptionist . I said I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got upstairs . They gave me the first methadone shot . I was in a hospital gown , and I went to the toilet and sat on the floor to wait for the reaction . I put my arms around the commode and held tight to it . " " But you did n't go through with the methadone treatment . "  | " No , sir . I did not . Something happened . When I came in I had the table leg , I was ready to kill . I would have killed the lady if she called the cops again . But in less than an hour I was called to stop a riot . I had to stop a man breaking up the joint . He was a black man , as big as me , and he had delirium tremens . He smashed the chairs in the patients ' sitting room . He broke a coffee table , broke windows . The orderlies and nurses were like kindergartenersaround him . He was like a buffalo . I had to take a hand , Professor . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodeand went out and took control . I put my arms around the man . I got him to the floor and lay on the top of him . I do n't say he was listening , but he was n't so wild with me . They gave him a needle and we laid him on a cart and put him in bed . " " That was Smithers ? " " Smithers , " said Winthrop . " I wish I could explain what it was all about . I 've told this before . It 's as if I kept after it till I could find out what happened that moment I took control of him . Maybeit was because I died twenty-four hours before . Maybe because my buddy left me in the bathtub in the hotel  --  that was all he knew how to do for me . But when they put Smithers in bed , I sat by him and minded him . " " This was when your own treatment stopped . " " I would n't leave him . They had to measure his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . You understand what I 'm saying ? I held his dick for him to pee in the flask . He had a bad ulcer in his leg . I treated that , too . That was his cure , and it was my cure , at the same time . I was his mother , I was his daddy . And we stayed together since . " " And made this center . " " Built it ourselves in this old warehouse  --  the dormitories , kitchen , shops downstairs to teach trades . We bring in old people from the neighborhood  --  the old , they 're starving on food stamps , scavengingbehind the supermarkets . The markets post guards , they say they do n't want the old people to poison themselves on spoiled fish . We need those old people here . They teach upholstery , electricalwork , cabinetmaking , dressmaking . They teach respect top192young hoodlums , too . But it is n't only hoods . We get all kinds here . We take all the kinds  --  white , black , Indians , whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Lake Forest ... " " You 'd call this center a success ? " Winthrop stared at him a moment . Then he said , " No , sir , I do n't call it that . They come and go . It takes with some . I could name you a many and a many it never could save . " Until now Winthrop had sat immobile in his chair , but now he turned and , to Corde 's great surprise , began to lower himself towards the floor . What was he doing ? He was on his knees , his big arm stretched towards the floor , his fingers hooked upward . " You see what we have to do ? Those people are down in the cesspool . We reach for them and try to get a hold . Hang on  --  hang on ! They 'll drown in the shit if we ca n't pull ' em out . Some of ' em we 'll get out . Some of them will go down . They 'll drown and sink in the shit  --  never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of his face to twitch , he labored to his feet and backed himself into the chair again . " You 're telling me that the people who come here ... " " I 'm telling you , Professor , that the few who find us and many hundred of thousand more who never do and never will  --  they 're marked out to be destroyed . Those are people meant to die , sir . That 's what we are looking at . " It was at this point , out of earnestness and without seeing how it would be taken by the public , that Corde began to speak in his articles of " superfluous populations , " " written off , " " doomed peoples . " That did n't go down well . You could use terms from sociologyor Durkheim or Marx , you could speak of anomie or the lumpenproletariat , the black underclass , of economically redundant peasantries , the Third World , the effects of opium on the Chinesep193masses in the nineteenth century  --  as long as it was sufficiently theoretical it went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical and social work bureaucracies , without objection . But when Corde began to make statements to the effect that in the wild , monstrous setting of half-demolished cities the choice that was offered was between a slow death and a sudden one , between attrition and quick destruction , he enraged a good many subscribers . Something went wrong . He wrote about whirling souls and became a whirling soul himself , lifted up , caught up , spinning , streaming with passions , compulsive protests , inspirations . He experienced , as he saw when he looked back , a kind of air anarchy . He began to use strange expressions . He wrote , for instance , that Toby Winthrop was a " reconstituted " human being , a " murderersavior " type ; that Winthrop was therefore an advanced modern case . Why ? Because the advanced modern consciousness was a reducedconsciousness inasmuch as it contained only the minimum of furniture that civilization was able to install ( practical judgments , bare outlines of morality , sketches , cartoons instead of humanbeings ) ; and this consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstract , was basically murderous . It was for this reason that murder was so easy to " understand " ( or had he written " extenuate " ? Thinness for thinness ) . He never did get around to explaining how we must reconstitute ourselves . Because of the incompleteness of his argument he confused many readers . Some wrote contemptuously , others were incensed . He had n't meant to make such a stir . It . To this Varennes , the Public Defenderin the Spofford Mitchell murder case , Corde had very nearly spoken his full mind . The results , in the lingo people were using nowadays , were " counterproductive . " Corde had gone to see Sam Varennes to discuss the case and to ask permission to interview Mitchell . Varennes was interested in publicity , but in the end he and his defense team decided that any pretrial media coverage would be prejudicial to their client . Cordep194had , however , reported his conversation with Varennes in full . The Mitchell case was not exceptional . There were thousands of similar crimes in police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which made it important to Corde . The victim was a young suburban housewife , the mother of two small children . She had just parked in a lot near the Loop when Mitchell approached and forced her at gunpoint into his own car . The time was about 2 P.M. Spofford Mitchell 's Pontiac had been bought from a Clark Street dealer just after his recent release from prison . Corde did n't know how the purchase was financed . ( The dealer would n't say . ) In the front seat , Mitchell forced Mrs. Sathers to remove her slacks , to prevent escape . He drove to a remote alley and assaulted her sexually . Then he locked her into the trunk of his Pontiac . He took her out later in the day and raped her again . By his own testimony , this happened several times . At night he registered in a motel on the far South Side . He managed to get her from the trunk into the room without being seen . Possibly he was seen ; it did n't seem to matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her out and locked her in the trunk again . At ten o'clock he was obliged to appear at a court hearing to answer an earlier rape charge . He parked the Pontiac , with Mrs. Sathers still in the trunk , in the official lot adjoining the court building . The rape hearing was inconclusive . When it ended he drove at random about the city . On the West Side that afternoon , passersby heard cries from the trunk of a parked car . No one thought to take down the license number ; besides , the car pulled away quickly . Towards daybreak of the second day , for reasons not explained in the record , Spofford Mitchell let Mrs. Sathers go , warning her not to call the police . He watched from his car as she went down the street . This was in a white working-class neighborhood . She rang several doorbells , but no one would let her in . An incomprehensibly frantic woman at five in the morning  --  peoplewanted no part of her . They were afraid . As she turned away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and reclaimedher . He drove to an empty lot , where he shot her in the head . He covered her body with trash.  |p195She  was soon discovered . Exceptionally prompt , the police descended on Mitchell . He was found in the garage behind his father'shouse , cleaning out the trunk of his Pontiac , hosing out the excrements . He confessed , then retracted , confessed again . He was being held in County Jail for trial . These were the facts Corde learned from the papers . He was then preparing his article . What might the real content of these facts be ? He made inquiries and was referred to the Public Defender in charge of the case , Mr. Sam Varennes . In Harper 's he gave an account of his long conversation with Varennes , whom he described as ... a strong bald young man with prominent blond eyebrows and a wide throat , a college athlete in his time . The views we exchanged were enlightened , intelligent , liberal  --  did us both credit . To be appointed Defender you generally needed some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often well-qualified conscientious public servants . Mr. Varennes is a scholarly lawyer , well nigh a Doctor of Jurisprudence . I think he said Stanford . He asked first what feelings I had about the case . I admitted that I was subject to claustrophobia , and that I believed I might rather be killed than get into the trunk of a car at gunpoint , that sometimes I had fantasies in which I said , " You 'll have to shoot me . " But if I were pushed in and had the lid slammed on me I would hunt for a tire tool to hit the gunman with at the first opportunity . To lie in a trunk was like live burial . I could never endure it . I then said , " Only think how Mrs. Sathers must have begged the man every time he opened the lid . " He seemed , to my own surprise , slightly surprised by this . " You think she prayed for her life ? " " Begged or prayed  --  ' Let me out ! ' " Mr. Varennes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had put himself in a posture to make an effective argument for his client ( a man , after all , a human being like the rest of us ) , so he was much disturbed . I think also that I myself  --  the interviewer  --  disturbedhim . I was disturbed . He said , " You suppose ? I had n't thought about that .... " I said , " Oh , but she must have . " " And he was indifferent , are you saying ? " " I would n't say indifferent . I 'm trying to guess whether he understood her emotions . If you say something in all the ear/nestness of your heart , and wonder why this does n't . . . with this earnestness it must  --  it must get through . If he had understoodher pleading he would have been a different kind of mur-derer . " " The kind who feeds on the victim 's pain , like this mass killer Gacey , who specialized in boys ? Part of his sexual kick ? Subtler and more perverted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mocked his victims . " " So you do n't believe Mitchell was the same ? " " Classification of psychopaths is technically beyond me . My only guess about Mitchell is that he was just bound for death . If you 've taken that fast direct track , you may be deaf and blind to something so exotic as the pleading of a woman whom you 've locked in your car trunk . " " A more primitive person , " said Varennes . I saw that the Defender was examining me on my social views . Mr. Varennes is a muscular man . Even his throat has muscles , a pillar throat . I think he pumps iron . He said next , " As part of the defense we may argue that Mrs. Sathers accepted the situation . " " Does he say she did ? " " Some of the time she rode in the front seat with him . She was seen by witnesses when he stopped at a bar to buy a bottle of Seven-Up . When he went in to get the drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't run away . You might say he had tied her feet . " " I did n't . But it 's probable that she was dazed . " " As dazed as all that ? " " Felt she was already destroyed . There must be a sense of complicity in rapes . The sex nerves can stream all by themselves . If people think they 're going to be murdered anyway when it 's over , they may desperately let go . " " Sexually ? " " Yes . In spite of themselves , spray it all out . They 're going to die , you see . Good-bye to life . " " That 's quite a theory . " " Maybe . But that 's quite a situation , " I said . " And with the special confused importance , the peculiar curse of sexuality or carnality we 're under  --  we 've placed it right in the center of life and connect it with savagery and criminality  --  it 's not at all a wild conjecture . The truth may even require a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure is **25;9005;TOOLONG . The full physical emphasis is fatal . It cuts usp197off . The fullest physical joining may always be flavored with death , therefore . This was why I said Spofford Mitchell was on the fast track for death  --  fast , clutching , dreamlike , orgastic . Grab it , do it , die . " I reminded myself that I was talking with a gymnast . He had backed off his head as if to get a different slant , and took me in again , extremely curious . So I resumed the interviewer 's role . " It may be wrong to pry into the last hours of Mrs. Sathers . Well , we were discussing why she did n't make a run for it when he went into the bar . Is it a fact that witnesses saw her waiting alone ? ... " " I 've taken the depositions . " " I 'm trying to imagine the despair that kept her from opening the door . And suppose he had chased her down the street ; would anybody have helped her ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , when you put it that way . I suppose that 's what the prosecution would say . " His next comment was , " My team and I are on these homicides year in year out . We ca n't get up the same fervor as an outsider . " I made a particular effort now to recover my interviewer 's detachmentor professional cool . I am obliged to admit that I never know why I say certain things when I 'm agitated . It was nice of him to call it " fervor " ; it was far more insidious , a radical disturbance . But he was a nice man . His looks appealed to me . I liked his serious eyes and strong bald head . And this induced me to talk more . His examination continuing , for he was examining me ( as if there were something about me that was not strictly speaking contemporary ) , he tried me on the professional side and invited me to discuss the situation in broader terms  --  the mood of the country , the inner city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to describe the pieces I intended to write . Why was I doing them , and what would they be like ? I explained that the Cordes had moved up to Chicago from Joliet more than a centuryago and that I had been born on the North Side and thought it would be a good idea to describe the city as I had known it , and that my aim was more pictorial than analytical . I had looked up my high school zoology teacher , for instance , whom I had helped with the animals , feeding them and cleaning the cages . Also a self-educated Polish barber who used to lecture boys on Spengler 's Decline of the West while he cut their hair . I had traced him to Poznan , where he was now living on his So/cial Security checks from America . I revisited the Larrabee Street YMCA . Also the Loop . The Loop 's beaneries , handbooks , dinky dives and movie palaces were wiped out . Gigantic office towers had risen everywhere . Good-bye forever to the jazz musicians , and the boxing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharks from Bensinger 's on Randolph Street . Then I mentioned a number of contemporary subjects , among them the new housing developments south of the Loop in the disused freight yards ; and the mammoth Deep Tunnel engineering project , the Cloaca Maxima one hundred and thirty miles long and three hundred feet beneath the city . Not wishing to ruffle him , I made no reference to my interest in the abuse of " immunities " under federal law by U.S. attorneys ( refractory witnesses who rejected the immunity offer were sentenced for contempt of court ; judges had the right to send them to jail for a year ) . It would have done me no good to discuss this with Mr. Varennes . Nor did I mention my interest in the case of Rufus Ridpath , the same people who had dumped Ridpath having perhaps appointedVarennes . Whether I could be trusted , what my angle was , why I was n't somehow one hundred percent contemporary in my opinions  --  these were the Public Defender 's questions . I came well accredited  --  journalist , professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prospect of favorable publicity for his team , I was suspect , he smelled trouble . He was right , too . A certain instability .. . Corde laid aside Valeria 's copy of Harper 's and tried again , reframingthe interview , as if he intended to write a new version , wider in perspective , closer to the real facts , taking bigger forces into account . The meeting with Varennes was one of those occasionswhen ( if you are like Albert Corde ) you are strongly temptedto say what is really on your mind . Very dangerous . In ordinarylife you dig far below your real thoughts . But if you come soaring by , why should n't the fellow shoot you down ? On the other hand , he may be the exceptional case , and perhaps he wo n't shoot . True , Varennes was running any number of dependability tests . Did I play by Chicago rules or would I cut some exotic caper and embarrass or damage him ? For his part , the Provost had decided that I did n't accept the Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought tons of trouble down on him . But Varennes also buttered me up , you might say . He led me on . He said that on his first undergraduate holiday in Paris he had read my columns in the Herald Tribune . He asked whether I was familiar with Solzhenitsyn'sHarvard Address . Yes , and here and there I agreed with it . I hedged a little . Varennes was checking my papers , as it were , to see whether my liberal sympathies were in order . I said that liberalism had never accepted the Leninist premise that this was an age of wars and revolutions . Where the Communists saw class war , civil war , pictures of catastrophe , we only saw temporary aberrations . Capitalisticdemocracies could never be at home with the catastrophe outlook . We are used to peace and plenty , we are for everything nice and against cruelty , wickedness , craftiness , monstrousness . Worshipers of progress , its dependents , we are unwilling to reckonwith villainy and misanthropy , we reject the horrible  --  the same as saying we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us is at heart trustworthy , each of us is naturally decent and wills the good . The English-speaking world is temperamentally like this . You see it in the novels of Dickens , clearly . In his world , there is suffering , there is evil , betrayal , corruption , savagery , sadism , but the ordeals end and decentpeople arrange a comfortable existence for themselves , make themselves cozy . You may say that was simply Victorianism , but it was n't  --  is n't . Modern businessmen and politicians , if they 're going to give billions in credit to the other side , do n't want to think about an epoch of wars and revolutions . They need to think about contractual stability , and therefore assume the basic seriousnessof the authorities in Communist countries  --  their counterparts , officials , practical people like themselves , but with different titles . More of this real-sounding discussion , mutually comforting ideas . Those were the stillborn babies of intellect . Dead , really . I realized that long ago . They originate in the brain and die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple belief in progress goes with a deformed conception of human nature.  |p200But  Varennes got a bang out of this discussion . He did n't want all the time to be thinking about lousy rapes and murders . He knitted his fingers and said he had been reading a new study of the Munich mentality  --  Chamberlain 's inability to dope out Hitler'sdesigns . He asked me , " Where did you get your own catastropheexposure ? " I said , " In Germany in the forties when I was young . But probablyeven more by what I read as a young kid in my father 's library . He was an artilleryman in the First World War and collectedbooks on the subject . I read a great deal at an impressionableage about trench warfare . In some sectors they paved trenchesin winter with frozen bodies to protect the feet of the Tommies . You knew it was spring when the corpses began to cave in under your boots . I did n't stop with Remarque and Barbusse , or Kipling . I went into the memoirs of infantrymen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way into corpses , entering at the liver and gnawing their way upwards , getting so fat they had trouble squeezing out again at the mouth . There should be a shorthand for facts of that category . Or maybe there ought to be a supplement to the Book of Common Prayer to cover them . They have rearranged our souls . This is Lenin 's age of wars and revolutions . The idea has gotten around by now . " The Public Defender said , " Except the Americans ? The last of the ideology-negative nations ? " Needing time to think over these propositions , Varennes turned his head to one side , looking out from the big but unopenable window of his air-conditioned office . He was a steady and strong man . He would be steady when he worked out at the gym ; also steady and strong while he was cutting his medium-rare New York sirloin at Gene and Georgetti 's ; presumably he would be strong in the sack , a pillar of muscle on the bosom of some swelling , soft girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hands clasped low in my lap ( between my cambered thighs  --  the legs criticized by my nephew ) , with my swelled eyes , yoked goggles , whitening brow hairs , pale dish face and long , uncomplaisant ( only complaisant-looking ) mouth . Varennes went on , " Our catas/trophe is these inner city slums ? Or  --  tell me if I follow you  --  the Third World erupting all over ? " And as well as I can remember , he went on to say I was suggesting that a man like Mitchell was an unconscious agent of world catastrophe , or an involuntary one . " Do you identify him with terrorists or Third World fanatics ? Are you asking whether we  --  the bourgeois democracies  --  are capable of coming to grips with the catastrophe mentality ? " The thought I had then I can recall clearly . I said that America no more knew what to do with this black underclass than it knew what to do with its children . It was impossible for it to educate either , or to bind either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life just now . Sensing this , the children attached themselves to the black underclass , achieving a kind of coalescence with the demand-mass . It was not so much the inner city slum that threatenedus as the slum of innermost being , of which the inner city was perhaps a material representation . As I spelled this out I felt that I looked ailing and sick . A kind of hot haze came over me . I felt my weakness as I approached the business of the soul  --  its true business in this age . Here a dean ( or a writer of magazine articles ) came to see a public defender to talk about a limited matterand their discussion became unlimited  --  their business was not being transacted . I was losing Mr. Varennes . Anguish beyond the bounds of human tolerance was not a subject a nice man like Mr. Varennes was ready for on an ordinary day . But I ( damn ! ) , starting to collect material for a review of life in my native city , and findingat once wounds , lesions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how quirkily ) called upon for a special exertion  --  to interpret , to pity , to save ! This was stupid . It was insane . But now the processwas begun , how was I to stop it ? I could n't stop it . Varennes seemed to glimpse this and he said , " It 's still not clear to me what you have in mind , overall . " I took a different tack for the moment . I said , " You may have seen a long article in the paper recently . Fifty prominent people were interviewed on what Chicago needs to make it more exciting and dynamic . " " I think I saw that . "  | " Some of these people were lawyers , some were architects , one the owner of a ball club ; also , business executives , advertising men , journalists and TV commentators , musicians , artistic directors , publishers , city planners , urbanologists , a famous linebacker , merchandising big shots , et cetera . " " The beautiful people , " said Varennes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Paris or Venice , and others that we should have developments like GhirardelliSquare in San Francisco or Faneuil Hall in Boston . One wanteda gambling casino atop the Hancock Building ; another that the banks of the Chicago River should be handsomely laid out . Or that there should be cultural meeting places ; or more offbeat diningplaces , or discos . A twenty-four-hour deli . A better shake for the handicapped , especially those who use wheelchairs . But no one mentioned the terror . About the terrible wildness and dread in this huge place  --  nothing . About drugs , about guns ... " " Yes , " Varennes said , " but that 's hardly a serious matter , the opinions of those people , what the interior decorators are saying , what the feature editors print . " " Quite right , but it made me think it was high time to write a piece , since I grew up here . Several generations of Cordes ... " Varennes then said that we had had a very thoughtful exchange , he and I , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? by implication ) . I had to agree . We sat there explaining evils to each other , to pass them off somehow , redistribute the various monstrouselements , and compose something the well-disposed liberal democratic temperament could live with . Nobody actually said , " An evil has been done . " No , it was rather , " An unfortunate crazed man destroyed a woman , true enough , but it would be wrong of us to constitute ourselves judges of this crime since its causes lie in certain human and social failures . " A fine , broadmindedconclusion , and does us credit . Although real intelligence is too vigilant to accept this credit and suggests to us all ( since it is universal , the common property of all human beings ) that this is only a form , and a far from distinguished form , of mutual aid . Varennes went on , " I do n't know what you 'd get out of talkingp203with Spofford Mitchell . I 'd have to take this up with my team , and I 'd have to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I guess you would find it interesting to see where he is . The more serious homicide cases are way down below . The officers do n't even open their doors at mealtimes down there . They push their trays under the doors . Then the rats come along and lick the icing off the bars . " " Icing ? " Varennes said , " The kitchens bake cake .... " The look we exchanged over the cake was singular . But I broke it off , and backed down . I said , why not  --  cake and icing , why not ? And it was too bad about the extra-security cells . I changed the subject . Of course I did n't want to get in the way , infringe on Mitchell 's rights in any way or hamper his defense . He said he aimed to save Spofford Mitchell from the chair . I asked , was this a professional aim or a moral-legal one  --  was he speaking as a lawyerwho did n't like to lose a case or did he have an obligation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear this question . He was uptight as he said he saw no conflict , and what a bad gang the prosecution was . They kept a tally on their office wall . For a death sentence they chalked up a skull and crossbones . Then he turned about and took the initiative from me . He became the questioner . He said I came down to inspect the Public Defender 's office and put him on the defensive as a representative of the educated middle class as if I thought he held a sinecure , and was self-indulgent . At least this mass of trained muscle could speak honestly . The base of his big throat became charged with emotion . He was n't angry yet , but a certain amount of indignation was developing , and he said that he did n't know yet where I stood , or from what point of view I was asking him whether he was being professional or moral . Well , high feeling was  --  or might be  --  a true sign of earnestness . This was better than the first stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to be serious  --  points for culture and serious concern earned on both sides . In this phase of the talk I was quite happy , in a whirling disori/ented way . I did n't expect him to let me interview Spofford Mitchell ( I was a dangerous person ) , but it was in its way a satisfactoryafternoon . I said , " You 're feeling out my racial views . No serious American can allow himself to be suspected of prejudice . This forces us to set aside the immediate data of experience . Because when we think concretely or preverbally , we do see a black skin or a white one , a broad nose or a thin one , just as we see a red apple on a green tree . These are percepts . They should not be under a taboo . " " Well , are they ? " " Yes , we try to stretch the taboo back to cover even these preverbaland concrete observations and simple identifications . Yes , you and I have been playing badminton with this subject for quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the taboo net . " Then he said , " Tell me , Dean , how do you see the two people in this case ? " " I see more than a white mask facing a black one . I see two pictures of the soul and spirit  --  if you will have it straight . In our flesh and blood existence I think we are pictures of something . So I see a picture , and a picture . Race has no bearing on it . I see Spofford Mitchell and Sally Sathers , two separatenesses , two separateand ignorant intelligences . One is staring at the other with terror , and the man is filled with a staggering passion to break through , in the only way he can conceive of breaking through  --  a sexual crash into release . " " Release ! I see . From fever and delirium . " " From all the whirling . The horror is in the literalness  --  the genital literalness of the delusion . That 's what gives the curse its finality . The literalness of bodies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to give this some thought . He must actuallyhave been thinking how to get rid of me . We 're usually waiting for somebody to clear out and let us go on with the business of life ( to cultivate the little obsessional garden ) . But my case was more special  --  I had just exposed myself as a nut , a crank in dean'sp205clothing . That was our conversation seen from his side . Well , you never can tell what conclusions a man may reach when you try especially hard to talk straight to him . Neither party is good at it . No one is used to it . And all individual or true thoughts are essentiallyqueer . But outsides without insides  --  what did that mean ! Metaphysics ? Epistemology ? What ? We were sitting in his office in the Criminal Courts Building at Twenty-sixth and California . ( Here Corde would have added to the printed version in Harper 's that the sun was shining but even in broad daylight there was a touch of the violet hour . Maybe the architect had put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe the atmosphere did it , or a metabolic derangement of the senses , a sudden increase of toxicity . ) There had been many changes at Twenty-sixth and California since the old Bridewell days . New buildings had risen , a modern wing at County Jail , the achievement of Rufus Ridpath , for which his reward was disgrace , character assassination . Buses rolled up all day long . Prisoners brought from all the lockups in the city were unloaded here . The men hopped out by twos , handcuffed . As they went in pairs down the ramp to be processed in the jail , most were downcast or In a silent rage , but a few were having a hell of a time , reeling with homecoming spirits , yelling to the guards , " Hey , Mack ! Look who 's back ! " They trooped in to be psyched , social-worked , assigned to cells . Around the courts and prison buildings , viewed from the superbheight of Varennes ' office , lay huge rectangles , endless regionsof the stunned city  --  many , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of the city , visible from all points over fields of demolition , the tall glamour of the skyscrapers . Around the towers , where the perpetual beacons mingledtheir flashes with open day , there was a turbulence of two kinds of light . Varennes said , " When you talk about whirling you make it sound like the maelstrom  --  like Edgar Allan Poe . " " You mean apocalyptic . Once you start in with apocalypse you lose your dependable , constructive social frame of reference . "  |p206Now  , here Corde would have added , in an improved version of his article , that Varennes was healthy , a normal person , with a preference for decent liberal thought . The details of his appointment to the Public Defender 's job were normal in Cook County . It was not easy to get in without sponsorship . But he was a symbol , anyway , of the public demand for decency to which even big Clout was obliged to make ( limited ) concessions . Nevertheless he was an educated and a decent man  --  jogged , pumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he was interested in what the Dean had to say . Dean Corde , sitting there , palms upward in his lap , one leg flung over the other . The Dean had an underbrow glance of swerving shrewdness . It seemed to interest Varennes in a theoretical way to hear the Dean talk about turbulence and whirling states , about subhuman incomprehension , about a womanbegging for life when the lid of the car trunk was raised . Was his visitor trying to tell him ( a middle-class fear ) that the country was falling apart or something ? Actually the Dean did n't seem to be that sort of Nervous Nellie or commonplace hysteric . Some part of him really was shrewd ; at moments he was acute , even hardheaded . " What would you like ? " said Varennes . " Would you give the dead woman 's husband a gun and let him take shots at Mitchell through the bars of his cell ? " " Did I suggest anything like that ? " " No , you did n't , Dean . I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let me make it clear to you what I think . Your defendant belongs to that black underclass everybody is openly talking about , which is economically ' redundant , ' to use the term specialists now use , falling farther and farther behind the rest of society , locked into a culture of despair and crime  --  I would n't say a culture , that 's another specialists ' word . There is no culture there , it 's only a wilderness , and damn monstrous , too . We are talking about a people consigned to destruction , a doomed people . Compare them to the last phase of the proletariat as pictured by Marx . The proletariat , owning nothing , stripped utterly bare , would awaken at last from the nightmare of history . Entirelyp207naked , it would have no illusions because there was nothing to support illusions and it would make a revolution without any scenario . It would need no historical script because of its merciless education in reality , and so forth . Well , here is a case of people denuded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , they are n't proletarians . They 're just a lumpen population . We do not know how to approach this population . We have n't even conceived that reaching it may be a problem . So there 's nothing but death before it . Maybe we 've already made our derision . Those that can be advanced into the middle class , let them be advanced . The rest ? Well , we do our best by them . We do n't have to do any more . They kill some of us . Mostly they kill themselves .... " Varennes asked , " Is this the conclusion you aim at in your arti-cle ? " " Oh , I have n't even begun to reach a conclusion . So far I 'm only in the describing stage . What I 'm telling you is simply what I see happening . The worst of it I have n't gotten around to at all  --  the slums we carry around inside us . Every man 's inner inner city .. . Some other time we can talk about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The telephone rang . An important call . He excused himself ( I was ready to leave ) and got rid of me . He promised to discuss the matter with his colleagues . 1 le was a very nice man . Almost talkable-to . Those are the worst . For a while you almost feel you 're getting somewhere . Vlada Voynich could n't make it on Christmas Day . Travel had t red her , she explained to Minna on the telephone , but she would attend the funeral  --  of course she would be coming  --  and she 'd visit them afterwards at home . Minna was busy with callers . It was Cousin Dincutza who brought this message to Corde , Cordep208was shut up in the room ( by now it was his room ) . He had a bright winter day to look at . To mingle with visitors and make small talk was definitely beyond him . He did n't even try . Dincutza , replacing Gigi , who was very busy now , had assigned herself to look after him . She brought him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He learned from her that Gigi ' s campaignto bring Valeria to the Medical School had failed  --  no lying in state . Petrescu had called just now to say that an announcement of the funeral had just appeared in the afternoon paper . It was to be held at the crematorium . No official honors . In the morning Corde helped his ladies to organize themselves for the funeral . " It 'll be cold as hell there , " he said to Minna . " Rememberwhat it was like the other day . That dome is a refrigerator . " He urged her to wear her own American coat , but she would n't , she wrapped herself in her mother 's synthetic fur . She had layers of sweaters underneath , so she 'd be warm enough , she said . Gigi also wore an imitation fur . To Corde these coats were odd  --  the lusterless needles mingled brown and purple , they felt soft enough , they had a heavy look but no actual weight ; it was up to the wearer to put life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to make sure that Minna had everything she might need . She did n't seem to want much . But if he had n't offered , she would have noticed , abstracted though she was . Thankless work , but necessary . For the funeral there was funeral weather . No more sun , that was gone , only linty clouds and a low cold horizon . At daybreak there had been frost over the pavements ; patches of it remained . It was like the Chicago winter , which shrank your face and tightenedyour sphincters . Cousin Dincutza was waiting with Traian beside the small Dacia . In the cold Traian 's face was meaty , dense , the color of prosciutto . Under the zippered and belted leather jacket he was built like a small boiler . He wore the legs of his tight blue jeans tucked into his boot tops . At the corners of his mouth , the Mexican wisps , but when you saw him in profile the face turned Byzantine . It was the straight , long nose that did it , the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nose , and unlike Traian , she had the classic long Byzantine neck . Age had made it muscular . Because she was so stooped now , the neck detached itself from the collar of the syntheticcoat . Beneath her sadly intense brown eyes there were sallowcircles . In her own setting Minna , too , looked like a Greek woman . This corner of Europe was after all Macedonian , Roman , Armenian , Turkish  --  the Eastern empire . If the cold reminded you of Chicago , the faces were from the ancient world . But then in Chicago you had something like a vast international refugee camp , and faces from all over . It was in Chicago after all that he , a **27;9032;TOOLONG and whatnot else , found the **37;9061;TOOLONG who was exactly what he had been looking for . Corde was put in the front seat . The three ladies were in the back . Dincutza , the poor relation , sat in a sort of padded Chinese jacket between the two synthetic furs . Traian 's first stop was the hospital , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building . Heavy but quick , a compact man in crunching boots , he slammed the door and walked , efficient , to the service entrance . They watched him go in . Traian , thank God , knew what he was doing . When he returned , he spoke to the bundled passengers through the driver 's half-open window . He said Valeria was dressed and ready , and that the hearse was on its way , as arranged . He would stand in the main driveway to wait for it . Then he tipped his cap to Minna  --  or did he only resettle it on his head ?  --  and handed her a brown envelope containing Valeria 's rings , two of them . Corde turned in his seat as Minna shook them from the crumpled paper into her hand . It had been necessary to saw through the gold . They were clotted with blood . Corde drew back a little at the sight of the red drops , but Minna did not appearupset . She said , " This one with the stone was my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " With her thumbnail she chipped off the dried blood and wiped the rings with a paper tissue . She slipped off her wedding band , put on the sawed rings , and then again the wedding band . Keep them in place . The undertaker drove up in a panel truck . This was not whatp210Corde had expected  --  a sort of dry cleaner 's van , it would have been in the States . It backed up to the loading platform . The body was put in , and then Traian 's little car followed the faded blue van-hearse through the city . In the center of town traffic was alreadyheavy . The three ladies were silent , and Corde , in the fedora , had nothing to say . He looked out , noticing . What a man he was for noticing ! Continually attentive to his surroundings . As if he had been sent down to mind the outer world , on a mission of observation and notation . The object of which was ? To link up ? To classify ? To penetrate ? To follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assignment . Around an uphill curve they came up to the mortuary chapel on its hilltop , trickling smoke from the dome into gray air . The panel truck had just parked and Traian pulled up behind it . The attendants were drawing out Valeria 's lidless coffin . The technicianshad seen to her hair ; it was carefully dressed , would n't be exposed to the wind for long . Valeria was already being carried up the long flight of stairs in her silk suit , buttoned with silver Macedonianbuttons , long in the family . Italian high-heeled shoes . She had been wearing those shoes last spring in London when Corde had noticed that she was stumbling , first in front of the hotel and then at Burlington House . Those were the heels that had gone crooked and tripped her up . People stood waiting on the broad outer stairs , a beggar 's opera crowd of aged friends . Again , the suits and coats , the Sunday-best outfits cut fifty years ago from good prewar material . One old woman was burdened by a real fur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry it . She seemed determined to have a close look at Valeria . A ruined old husband supported her as she laboreddown the stairs to the coffin . They were just in time to see her as she passed . Valeria carried up the stairs by two men looked very much the Roman matron again , Corde thought , not the old woman he had electrified on her deathbed . Under the center of the dome the crowd was large . The chairs on both sides of the bier were only in the way , no one wanted to use them . They were pushed back . Corde stood between Minnap211and Gigi ; Cousin Dincutza was directly behind him . Friends of the family , coming up , understood only too well that Minna might not be able to recognize them . She had been gone more than twenty years . Some of them could not easily raise their heads for identification , their neck muscles had grown so stiff . Yes , many had the cervical arthrosia . There were splashes of dark pigment on their faces . Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were " Papa 's colleagues , " or old Party comrades , busted journalists , onetime boyars , former teachers , distant cousins . They came .. well , they had their reasons . They were there to signify , to testify . They came , also to remind Minna of their existence . " Yes , we 're still here , in case you wondered , and we could tell you plenty . And your mother , she got you away , it was one of her great successes . Good for you . And for her . Now it 's over for her , and *min for us , too . And this is what turns us out , in this gloom . " People had spent extravagantly on flowers . There were only carnations , and those were hard to come by . Dincutza said , " En hiver on trouve tres peu de fleurs . Its content les yeux de la tete . " She told Corde how many lei for a single carnation . Several times Valeria 's face had to be cleared of flowers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Petrescu alone was responsible for the wreaths . From official sources . There was a band of color also behind the crowd , on the perimeter . Along the curve of the wall were the square canisters of ashes , and pots of cyclamens with ribbons , lighted candles , burning speckles , fire grains , garnet points in the murk . There were candles , flowers , but it was freezing . Cold consumed ( ' orde under his socks and sweaters . You could feel the fires below . Currents of heat flowed under the floor , but it was n't the Rind of heat you could be warmed by . It came from the openings at the edges of the raised bier , through the metal joints , from underthe long bivalve barrel which would close when the coffin sank . The speeches now began . Corde had lived long enough in Europeto be familiar with Communist oratory , the lame rhythms of rhetorical questions and answers . " Who was this woman ? She was ... a comrade , a militant . . . " Terrible stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that by now there was no other style of public speaking in any province of the Russian empire , and he blessed his ignorance of the language . The last speech  --  they were all short  --  was delivered by Mihai Petrescu , who proved to be by far the most emotional of them all . He could not finish , he broke down . As if to cover him , the slow movement of Beethoven 's Third began to vibrate unevenly from loudspeakers . The tapes were frayed , thready , quavering . Minna brushed away the flowers on the step of the bier , knelt by the coffin and kissed Valeria . Next Tanti Gigi bent over her sister 's face . The syntheticfur bristled over her back . Cousin Dincutza just then began whispering to Corde from behind . There was a last formality to attend to . Still one document to be signed . Regulations required that a member of the family go below for final identification of the deceased before cremation . " By me ? " " Or her sister , or her daughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pas assez proche . Otherwise , would n't she have done it herself ? She saw that he was rattled . The thought of going underneath bristled over him . He 'd have to go . What alternative was there ? The old woman took his arm soothingly , as if to tell him there was nothing to be afraid of . He put his faith in her mottled face , brown buck teeth , sparse hair , goodness of heart . He said okay . This was not the moment to speak to Minna . Quavering , the big Beethoven chords now concluded ; the barrel cylinder was closing and simultaneously the coffin began to go down , flowers tumbling after into the gap . The action was quick . The heavy drum grated shut . Valeria had gone below . Immediately , Minna and Gigi were surrounded by friends . Corde followed Dincutza through the crowd . Traian was waiting at the head of the stairs . Corde went first , they made way for him . He took air like a diver and trotted down into the increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom he saw Ioanna beside the coffin , which had just arrived . She was kissing Valeria 's hand , lay/ing it to her cheek . She wept and spoke brokenly to the dead woman . " What 's she saying ? " " Asking to be forgiven , " said Dincutza . For being a police informer ? Just as Petrescu , the only speaker who had choked up , was a member of the security forces ? But it was n't likely that Ioanna would blame herself for having a police connection . If you did n't have one you were n't a concierge , and what was wrong with being a concierge ? And if she was going to protect the old sisters it was necessary to be in with the cops . And it was n't the packets of money , it was n't the presents from Londonthat she did it for . She would have said , " The Doamna Doctor loved me ; I loved her . " When Ioanna , crouching by the coffin , lifted her eyes to Corde , the blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the heat he had felt underfoot in the hall . It was like a stokehold . It went into the tissues , drove all your moisture to the surface . Corde , who had come down shivering , now felt the hot weight of the fedora , his sweatband soaking . He tried by shallowbreathing to keep out the corpse smoke , protect his lungs . The heat made you feel all your organs like paper , like the Christmas bell ornaments that used to unfold , all red cells inside and cracklingwhen they were opened . His throat was drying out , and he began to cough . The punt coffin ( with flowers ) sat on a conveyor belt which moved forward a notch at a time . Weeping , Ioanna followed it . Again a stop . There were other bodies preceding VaIeria 's . Corde could only think of her as the dead , waiting to be burned . As between frost and flames , were n't flames better ? Traian was convincing the belowstairs official who sat at a high desk that this foreigner was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be examined . He handed over the blue U.S. passport , still looking towards Ioanna . It was right that she should cry over the body , he even owed her something for it . Handed a ballpoint , Corde bent to the register and scrawled his name full across the page . Then he straightened , twitched off his glasses , groped in the inner pocket for the case  --  for the love of Christ , let 's get out of here . There were sweat circles under his arms fromp214the blasting heat . The people here were n't going to open those black steel doors and let them watch a coffin rattling over the rollers , entering , would n't show their fires to outsiders . Dincutza now drew him towards the stairs again and Ioanna helped him as if he were a baby whose incompetence she pitied ; but her bulk blocked his way . It was a tight fit in the staircase . Traian spoke sharply to her . On the first landing it was cold again . Corde felt cut in half by the extremes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dome and the crowd surrounding Minna . Better this cold than that heat . Corde 's breast , as narrow as a ladder , was crowded with emotions  --  fire , death , suffocation , put into an icy hole or , instead , crackling in a furnace . Your last options . They still appeared equally terrible . How to choose between them ! With Dincutza again making a way for him , he was brought back to stand beside Minna . Ah , the American husband , the Dean . People had been looking for him . They had come to pay their respects , but they were here also to see this couple , the famous astronomer nee Raresh and the man she had married . Old guys gave Corde rapid French handshakes , German bows . Gigi ' s interpretation of the large turnout was that people were telling the regime something . Well , maybe they were , but Corde did not see this as a demonstration . It was n't because Valeria had fallen from grace , or because she had stood up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rejoin the Party when they invited her . They came out with a sort of underfed dignity in what was left of their presocialist wardrobe , to affirm that there was a sort of life  --  and perhaps , as Communistsor even Iron Guardists ( it was conceivable ) , they had sinned against it  --  the old European life which at its most disgracefulwas infinitely better than this present one . Most of them were too old to worry about reprisals , and in any case what had they done but dig their Vienna-made suits out of mothballs , put on the balding furs their backs were too weak to support , click heels , murmur French , pay respects to a leading member of their generation , et cetera ? Gigi said to Corde , " While you were away Vlada Voynichp215passed in the greetings line . But she said she would come later to the house .... Many important people are here . I have never seen such an occasion . I did not expect Dr. Gherea . He has had the decency , after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize him from the picture ? " Looking for the notorious neurosurgeon , Corde saw instead the heavy figure of his boyhood friend Dewey Spangler , the groomed heard , the full plum flush of his mature face . In moments of excitementhe still executed the rapid double nod downward with his chin  --  a charming mannerism , come to think of it . Corde thought , Whattaya know . He took the trouble to come . I did n't realize I meant that much to him .... Maybe I do n't . Introduced to Minna , Dewey made an approving grimace to Corde , he gave his okay . Some things had n't changed  --  Dewey 's expressions of face , for instance . The essentials were what they had been , only more condensed . He said , " What about our drink , pal ? " " This afternoon ? " said Corde . " I 'll rescue you at two o'clock . It 's our last chance . " By noon , in clear , warmer weather , Corde welcomed the streets after the chill of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of your system . Walking from the apartment with Vlada Voynich , he ventilated his lungs . All that day it felt to him as if he must make an effort to rewarm his blood and clear the smoke from his breathing tubes . He had had just time enough before leaving the house with Vlada to eat a slice of bread and butter and to swallow a large shot of Balkan plum brandy . Powerful stuff , but it went to his extremities rather than his brain ; his hands and feet felt tighter , even the surface of his face was tingling as if a helpful pal had given him a few slaps for his own good . He was not entirelyp216himself  --  the inward fever , ice in the system , he felt disarticulated . But why should he expect to be himself ? At the crematorium he had gone through a death rehearsal . You could n't rehearse death gratis . It had to cost something . Vlada , glancing at him from the side , evidently saw that he did n't look well and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't it ? " This was unacceptable , for some reason . He fended off her sympathy . " You mean the whole December ? Oh , I had some time to myself . I caught up on my sleep . The old apartment is very quiet , except for the telephone . Minna 's room was a kind of sanctuary . It 's Minna who 's having it hard . " " Where shall we go for this talk ? " " If it is n't too cold , and the sun keeps shining , I 'd prefer the open air to a cafe . " " There 's a small park just up the street . There used to be . " " It 's still there . Minna pointed it out the other day  --  near her old school . " Vlada was a woman in whom you could have confidence  --  solid . She was large , her face wide , middle-aged , calm , candid , her complexion very white , the whiteness thick , almost opaque . Becauseof the length of her smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sister Elfrida . Her hair , like Elfrida 's , was unsuitably dyed , far too dark . He would have hesitated to touch it . Dyes and fixative sprays took the life out of hair . But Vlada must have considered this when she made her decision . She was a chemist , after all , she knew what manufacturers put into dyes and sprays . They settled on a bench in the sun between two pollarded trees  --  dwarf branches knobbed , knuckled with sealed buds on the bunched twigs , and the trunks wrapped smooth in winter hides . " Ah , how nice . " He bent his hat at the back to protect his neck from the chill . A poor park , badly kept ; but he was glad to be here with Vlada . He trusted her , he took comfort in her . The large head of hair parted down the middle and coming down in two waves , the wide teeth , the reassuring feminine breath  --  to him these werep217elements of stability . She had been married once , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account , one of the world 's permanentand growing population of educated lunatics . Too bad  --  she would make someone a dependable wife , a good warm embracer , and stable ; she would be sympathetic , intelligent , decent . But above all she was stable . Corde often sized up marriageable women in this way , entertained notions about them  --  maybe illusionswas the fitter word . " You have n't got any news for me about the Lucas Ebry trial , have you , Vlada ? " " Only more of the same in the newspapers . " " There ought to be a verdict soon . Did Alec Witt send some messages for me ? " " I brought you an envelope . It 's back at the apartment . . . . My brother told me about the Colonel . So now you 've had a taste of our country . " " Your country ? I thought you were Serbian . " " We are . Voynich is a Serbian name . But my brother married a Rumanian woman . That 's how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your brother tell you about the Colonel ? " " Firsthand he does n't know , but people like this generally are trained in prison administration , sometimes in those so-called psychiatricinstitutions where they keep dissidents . " " They do everything Russian style . If you 're a dissident who ca n't see the socialist paradise , you must be sick in the head ... . This Colonel must have lots of clout . " " The decision on a case like this probably was made higher up . " " Because Minna defected ? Valeria abhorred that word . The regimedid have it in for Valeria . Was it some old class thing ? " " Valeria was not a boyar . The Party is still hard on old boyar families . She was a Communist , all right , but she could n't get rid of the old distinguished-lady manner . Besides , she was a Dubcek sympathizer . Anyway , she 's gone . " " Yes . It puzzled me that they should make so much trouble in a case like this , of no political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only rubbing it in that nobody has any private rights . Which is not news . But as you say , she 's gone . ... I would havep218liked to talk to your brother . He said he 'd come take me for a walk . " " Oh , he could n't do that , Albert . He does n't talk . If you have a conversation with a foreigner , you 're supposed to report it to the authorities , and my brother has to be specially careful with the authorities . By the way , if any of Minna 's school friends wanted to invite her to their homes they would have to go and get an official clearance from something they call Protocol . Without Protocol they could n't give her a cup of tea . " " So your brother could n't risk it ? " " My brother was in prison for ten years , as a social democrat . Most of the time he was in solitary confinement . But then there was a mission of British Labor Party people coming . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked whom they would like to see , they named him . So he was taken out of solitary . They cleaned him up , shaved him , gave him a suit of clothes , and he was taken to an apartment . He was supposed to be giving a dinnerto the British delegation . It was about six in the evening . The guests were due at seven . At about six-fifteen , they brought in his wife . She had been in prison , too . Ten years . The one did n't know whether the other was still living . She was wearing a nice dress . No time to talk , the cook was an agent , anyway . Any minute , the bell would ring .... " " Ah , what a thing . The visitors never caught on ? Like G. B. Shaw in Russia . Like Henry Wallace . The old Potemkin Village trick . . . After which your brother and his wife were n't sent back ? " " They did n't send them back . . . . Last year his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't ask , Corde decided . I may have passed her canister . ) " And my brother lives alone , very quietly . No promenadeswith foreigners , though . He was sorry . He said you looked sympa . I told him he was right . Beech also thinks you 're sympa-thique . " " I liked him , too . " " Have you had a chance to read the material I gave you ? " " Oh , I 've had nothing but time . I did n't often get out of the house . Minna was afraid of letting me out alone . She thought theyp219might pick me up on some pretext , and that would really complicatethings . She may have been exaggerating , but I did n't argue ; it was better to stay put . Yes , I read the documents . " " I did n't give you any of the technical material . " " I see that . No point in loading me with chemical data I do n't understand . " " How did you feel about it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I felt interested . I felt alarmed by the danger . Naturally , I 'm a good concerned American . I want bad things to stop , good things to go forward . I want democracy to win , and civilization to survive , but I do n't want to become an environmentalist . For me it would be a waste of time , and I have n't the time to waste . " " Beech would never call himself that . He thought you might not quite understand and he asked me to explain more fully . To begin with , he has confidence in you . " " How can he have ? We met only twice  --  or was it three times ? That 's not enough . " " He 's read you . " " It was you that made him . " " Yes , but he thinks you 're an artist in your line , not the ordinarykind of journalist . " Corde put down his head to let this pass over . She was trying to calm him with flattery . Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And why should n't there be ? " Well , if I 'm some kind of artist , I must be busy with some kind of art . I wish I knew what it was . " In the wintry sunlight Vlada 's face was densely white . She gave him a fully open look . But he did n't have the confidence he had once had in these open looks . It was n't that he distrusted Vlada , but people were never as sincere as they revved themselves up to be . They could n't guarantee that their purposes were fixed and constant . Yes , constancy . Love is not love which alters where it alteration finds . What did love have to do with it ? She only wantedto show that he could really trust her . And what he thought was , I 'm pale , I look unwell , I look rotten , I 'm skittish and jumpy  --  I 'm all over the place ( quoting Shakespeare out of con/text ) . She wants to be nice to me . I had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , I trust you , Vlada , but you want to get me to take on this job . Probably she 's somewhat surprised that I do n't jump at the chance . It 's an honor . One thing is that her eyes ( the chestnut color , this open look ) are very handsome . The dark contrast with the white complexion does it . And the eyes are supposed to take me into a proposition I suspect to be dubious . I am willing to yield to the beaux yeux , but not necessarilyto the proposition . But she 's all right , she 's a good egg , and I 'll hear her out if she 'll hear me out . She 's devoted to Beech . I envy him that . He 's got beautiful support . If he were n't a good guy he would n't have won such devotion . No , that might not follow , either . She said , " I 've worked with him for years , and I can recommendhim . " " I like the man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types who turn out to be world geniuses . He looks like IchabodCrane . " Vlada said , " Your looks are misleading , too . " Bass voice , mild manner , plain appearance  --  yes . He said , " In Huckleberry Finn there 's a circus clown who falls over his own feet but turns out to be a marvelous equestrian and acrobat . Maybe that 's the classic American model  --  look like a poor stick but turn somersaults on a galloping horse . Well , I wo n't fence around with you , Vlada , on a day like this . " At this very instant Valeria might be going into the fire , the roaring furnace which took off her hair , the silk scarf , grabbed away the green suit , melted the chased silver buttons , consumed the skin , flashed away the fat , blew up the organs , reached the bones , bore down on the skull  --  that refining fire , a ball of raging gold , a tiny sun , a star . He had stopped talking . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . I seem to have a headache , something like eyestrain . You would n't have a Tylenol in your purse ? I can swallow it without water . "  | " No . Am I giving you a headache by putting pressure on you ? " " The Provost tried to tell me not to mix into this , that it might do Beech harm to associate with me . I should n't put Beech in the line of fire ; he has troubles enough . " " Yes , the Provost had a chat with Beech . " " And suggested that he might come in for some of the heat I 'm getting ? " " Well , are you really so hot as you think ? It 's just some local unpleasantness . Beech could say his findings affect all Homo sapiens , and the future of the entire species . " " I see that . He talks continually about Homo sapiens sapiens , and hominid evolution . " " What impressed him , and it 's the word he used , is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble , but you 're capable of fighting . But the antagonism of people in Chicago is insignificant . He has another ball game in mind altogether . " ( Corde enjoyedhearing slang from these foreign women . ) " Besides , Beech and the Provost have never gotten along . Look , if you go to Washingtonand testify that the mining and smelting of lead have to stop and that the food and canning industries should be restrained and that the U.S. should lead a world campaign and start immediately to clean up the air and the waters , at a cost of billions ... " " It does n't bring the college much financial support . It gets the FDA into the picture . And Witt would like to keep us apart  --  a wacko scientist and a cracked dean . " - " Why worry about Witt ? " " It is n't worry . The college has been decent to me . Even Witt went out of his way . " " He put up the reward for information in the murder case . So if he feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cross him . But this is merely administration politics . You 've got to look beyond that , much further . Beech ca n't communicate . He says if he were to try to do this himself he 'd end up like Bucky Fuller , giving incomprehensible lectures . I say nothing against Fuller  --  he 's wonderful . I only mean there 's a special cult public that loves high-minded kook specialists who preach salvation through or/ganic foods . . . how to preserve the shrinking water reserves in a demographic explosion . But try to understand what Beech is up against . He has to start a world discussion at the highest level . You have a gift for getting the attention of a serious public . " " I 'm good at sticking it to them , am I ? That 's probably true , but true because I have my own ends . I could n't do it for other people . It would n't work . No one would pay the slightest attention . " " I see that . I do . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . It would n't be a personal matter . It 's far from a personal matter with him . " " Yes , he made that clear to me . Liberal humanist culture is weak because it lacks scientific knowledge . He 'd communicate some science to me and then we could go forward . Minna also thinks it would upgrade me to associate with a man of science . Better than squalid Chicago , as a project . " " I ca n't really see why you 're so skeptical . You 're making me argue , fight . " " I do n't doubt the nobility of Beech 's intentions . " " He 's put together a masterpiece of research . " Corde said , " The sun is moving . I 'm beginning to feel cold again . Let 's walk a little . " " I have enough layers so that I do n't feel the frost , " said Vlada . " When I 'm about to come back to the old country I always begin to eat more . Last year all I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jars of garlic pickles , some sauerkraut . Now and then chickens turn up . You stand in line for eggs . Meat is hard to get even on the black market . Fish , never . Other Eastern bloc countrieshave changed from the original Stalin agricultural plan . This one , never . You ca n't even buy potatoes . I always fly back slim-mer . " They walked in the sun , on the crackling gravel path . " You carry the weight with class , " said Corde . " Among my Serbian family in Chicago , the women say , ' How do you expect to get a husband if you do n't reduce ? ' But I tell them , ' I may not get one even if I stop eating , and then I 'm a double loser . '  | " According to your own theory , the more you eat , the more you stupefy yourself with lead . " She laughed and said , " It does n't build up as fast as that . " Corde valued grace in fat women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her foot . " You ca n't get inured or mithridated ? " She shook her head . That was n't possible . " Only poisoned . The nervous system is permanently affected . Kids become behavior problems , restless , frantic , and intelligence is permanently im-paired . " " Therefore this world  --  and no matter what we 're like , it 's a delicious world ... " " Yes , is the answer . " " So the bottom line is that we eat and drink lead , we breathe it . It accumulates in the seas , which are getting heavier by the day , and it 's absorbed by plants and stockpiled in the calcium of the bones . Brains are being mineralized . The great reptiles with their small brains wore thick armor , but our big brains are being hardenedfrom within ? " He amused Vlada with this survey . More widely smiling , lips large and long , and her white face vividly warm , she said , " I love it when you get going , Albert . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thinking aloud . I 'm not talking myself into anything . " Then he came near laughing , and when she asked him why , he said , " Well , you see what it 's like here . We were at the crematorium just this morning and now we 're discussing whether I should join Beech in his campaign to warn mankind against the greatest danger of all . At the moment I feel myself crawling between heaven and earth , and it is a little funny to be offered a big role : the rescuer . Christ , not me ! The heart damn near jumped out of my chest when I had to go below to identify Valeria . I was dripping sweat and having fits and convulsionsin the guts . And now I 'm strolling in this park with you , I 'm a gentleman again , taking the grand survey of man 's future , the fate of the earth . " " I see that , " said Vlada . " It 's a bad day to try to get your atten/tion for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these circumstances . " " No , I admire Beech , and I 'd like to go into some of this with him . He probably feels he ca n't wait , pressed for time . Asked you to sound me out , get me started . " " I never led him to think that because we 're friends , and I 've been close to Minna since the Harvard days , that I had you in my pocket . " " Of course you did n't . And I 'm trying to look as closely as I can at the whole proposition . Sometimes these ' hard ' scientists are far out , like a separate species . It makes them especially interesting to me . " You married one . " " I married one . That 's different . That 's love . It brings Minna back from outer space . Some I 've met never do get back . Some are subject to storms of clear consciousness  --  my homemade term . Like turbulence , when the pilot asks you to fasten your seat belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leanings or are interested in poetry . Now that does appeal to me . And as for those that are far , far out , absorbed in their special complex games  --  I 've often thought it possible that one of them might turn out to be clairvoyant . Just a little . But you have to be careful about this . " " Let me see if I 'm following , " said Vlada . " Look at it this way : Lead as a mineral may or may not be the threat that Beech warns us against , but being ' leaden ' certainly is a characteristic . Sometimes I say ' earthen '  --  we often experience this earthenness . Sometimes I say ' sclerotic , ' or ' blind ; ' eyes that see not , ears that hear not '  --  and this leads up to ' the general end of everything ' heralded by sclerotic , blind and earthen . ' Lead ' is more sinister , maybe because of its color , hue or weight . Lead communicates something special to us about matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kid who wrote poems , Joey Hamil , and I remember one of his lines about ' Thy leaden mace flung upon my weathered brow . ' He did n't have a weathered brow . He was only sixteen years old . " " So you wonder whether ' lead ' is just what Professor Beech hasp225fixed upon but stands for something else that we all sense . " " That 's possible , is n't it ? The man is in his supersterile lab built for the analysis of moon rocks when it strikes him from both sides that an imbalance in the mineral realm itself threatens mankind , all of life and the world itself . There 's poetry in that , is n't there ? Man 's great technical works , looming over him , have coated him with deadly metal . We ca n't carry the weight . The blood is sobbingin us . Our brains grow feebler . This disaster also overtook the Roman Empire . It was n't the barbarians , it was n't the Christians , it was n't moral corruption : his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to prevent the souring of wine . Lead was the true source of the madness of the Caesars . Leaded wine brought the empire to ruin . " " Bones from Roman graves do show extreme concentrations of the metal , " said Vlada . " I 've examined those in my own lab . " " And that was only Rome . Now it 's the whole world . And it is n't the Grand Inquisitor 's universal anthill that we have to worryabout after all , but something worse , more Titanic  --  universal stupefaction , a Saturnian , wild , gloomy murderousness , the raging of irritated nerves , and intelligence reduced by metal poison , so that the main ideas of mankind die out , including of course the idea of freedom . " Corde breathed sharply , still ridding himself of ( imaginary ) smoke inhalation . He drew in the blue icicle-making air of the small park with its fallen fence of iron stakes  --  collapsed on weeds and bushes . " I wonder if Beech thinks as romantically as that , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him  --  but who knows , " said Corde . " And I 'm sure I 'm overdrawing it , but if there are mysterious forces around , only exaggeration can help us to see them . We all sense that there are powers that make the world  --  we see that when we look at it  --  and other powers that unmake it . And when people shed incomprehensible tears they feel that they 're expressingthis truth , somehow , one that may be otherwise inexpressible in our present condition . But it 's a rare sense , and people are n't used to it , and it ca n't get them anywhere . Tears may be intellec/tual , but they can never be political . They save no man from beingshot , no child from being thrown alive into the furnace . My late father-in-law would weep when he lost a patient . At the same time he belonged to the Communist underground . The Doctor would weep . I wonder if the Communist ever did .... " " This is an interesting talk , " said Vlada . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me straight .... " " Why , of course , " said Corde . " I 'm asking whether certain impulsesand feelings which play no part in the scientific work of a man like Professor Beech and lie ignored or undeveloped in his nature may not suddenly have come to life These resurrections can be gruesome . You can sometimes watch them  --  clumsy , absurdheart stirrings after decades of atrophy . Sometimes it 's the most heartless people who are inspired after forty years of reckoningand calculation and begin to accuse everybody else of being heartless . But as I see Beech , he 's innocent of that . The news , let 's call it that , reaches him in his lab as he puts the results of his research in order . Like , ' This earth which I 've been studying for a lifetime is a being , too . It gave birth to us all , but we are ungrateful , greedy and evil .... ' " " And this is news to him  --  to continue your argument  --  his feelings are untrained or undeveloped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better now . Even if he cried , which is not his way ... " " It would n't be a good approach to politics . You can see that I sympathize with him . And how I wish that clear , exquisite brains like his could resolve all our questions . They do n't , though . It 's endearing , however , that he looks like a hayseed , an Ichabod Crane , but that he 's a man of feeling and even a visionary . He wants to protect and to bless . But then he begins to talk  --  and what neo-Darwinian stuff he expounds : the two-billion-year struggle by organisms in the biosphere . I 'd rather eat a pound of dry starch with a demitasse spoon than read this . Truth should have some style . " " That 's where you might be of help . " " What  --  if I tried to speak for him ? "  | " It would depend upon how it was done . " " It depends upon what he would expect . There would be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved from poisoning by lead or heroin or synthetic narcotics like the Tees and Blues . The doubtful part of his proposition is that human wickedness is absolutely a public health problem , and nothing but . No tragic density , no thickening of the substance of the soul , only chemistry or physiology . I ca n't bring myself to go with this medical point of view , whether it applies to murderers or to geniuses . At one end of the scale is Spofford Mitchell . Did he rape and murder a woman because he put flakes of lead paint in his mouth when he was an infant ? At the other end , are Beethoven and Nietzsche great because they had syphilis ? The twentiethcenturyFaustus believed this so completely that for the sake of his art he would n't have his lesions treated , and the spirochete gave him his awful masterpieces as a reward . " " You 'd call that kind of medical interpretation itself ' sclerosis , ' or ' lead . ' " Vlada followed this . " Where Beech sees poison lead I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of the material world may put us into a case as heavy as lead , a sarcophagus which nobody will even have the art to paint becomingly . The end of philosophy and of art will do to ' advanced ' thought what flakes of lead paint or leaded exhaustfumes do to infants . Which of these do you think will bring us to the end of everything ? " " So that 's how you understand this ? " " Real philosophy , not the groveling stuff the universities mainlydo . Otherwise : I remember how I used to stare at Mendeleev 's chart in the science class . There it all was  --  Fe , Cu , Na , He . That 's what we were made of . I was so impressed ! That 's what everything was made of . But Pb is licking all the others . Pb is the Stalin of the elements , the boss . . . . Is it true that Beech has measured the age of the planet accurately ? " " Most geophysicists think so . " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I listened over and over to the tapes he gave me . There are parts I can recallp228almost verbatim . He never meant to be a crusader . He was only investigating lead levels and this led him into horror chambers . Then he saw vast and terrible things all the way into the depths of hell , and so forth , and the material foundations of life on this earth being destroyed . And if pure scientists had really understoodscience they would have realized the morality and poetry implicit in its laws . They did n't . So it 's all going to run down the drain , like blood in a Hitchcock movie . The Humanists also have flunked the course . They have no strength because they 're ignorantof science . They 're bound to be weak because they have no conception of what the main effort of the human mind has been for three centuries and what it has found . So Beech is offering me a trade . I must go back to the classroom and learn what it 's all about  --  really . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of science , I can take part in the decisive struggle  --  begin to restore the strength of Humanism . " " I see that does n't sit very well with you . " " I gave up writing for the papers ten years ago because  --  well , because my modernity was all used up . I became a college professor in order to cure my ignorance . We made a trade . I teach young people to write for the papers and in return I have an opportunity to learn why my modernity was used up . At the college I had time to read scads of books . In Paris I was too busy doing art items and intellectual chitchat . I did have some interesting assignments . For instance , I wrote a few pieces on the poetess Tsvetayeva as she was remembered by the Russian colony in Paris . How her husband , whom she loved deeply , became a member of the GPU and was forced to take part in killings . But there I 'm off the subject . I came back to Chicago to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles . There was no way to avoid it . The youngsterswould say it was my karma . Well , there 's low-down Chicago and there 's high-up Chicago . There 's Big Bill Thompson , and then there 's Aristotle , who has also had a longtime association with the city , which amuses a great many people . Aristotle , believe it or not , became a great influence in certain parts of Chicago . Our great sister institution the University of Chicago revived him . A.p229N . Whitehead , you know , believed that Chicago had Athenian possibilities . Well , Big Bill , that crook , was a PR pioneer . His sloganwas ' Put down your hammer , get a horn  --  Boost , do n't knock ! ' And then there was Aristotle : A man without a city is either a beast or a god . Well , Chicago was the city . Or was it ? Where was it , what had become of it ? No cities ? Then where was civilization ? Or was the U.S.A. as a whole now my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this chaos and live with Minna in a quiet place , and we could earn our bread somewhere in the woods , on a computer . The communications revolution could bypass Chicago or Detroit . Cities could be written off  --  dying generations , the blacks and Puerto Ricans , the aged too poor to move .... Let them be ruined , decay , die and eliminate themselves . There are some who seem willing that this should happen . I 'm not one of them . Not me . " Corde looked at his watch . It was half past one . " Yes , you have an appointment at two o'clock , " said Vlada . " We 'd better start back . I 'll try to explain to Beech why you have n't yet made up your mind . But now there 's something else . I have another message from Chicago for you ; this one is from your sister . " " Oh , you talked with Elfrida . How nice of you , Vlada , to call her . " " She called me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message . " " What was it that Elfrida wanted you to tell me ? " " She was worried how you would take it , although I said I could n't see why you would object .... She 's gotten married . " " What  --  Elfrida married ! " The unexpected news gave Corde a sharp pang . He gave no outward sign of this . He looked away and drew in his lips , thinking , Why should she do that ! Well , that 's Elfrida . He said , " I see . She married Sorokin ? " " Yes , the judge . Are you surprised ? " He had stopped ; his hands were deep in his pockets and his shoulders raised high . He looked sallow . " You do n't like that ? " " She did n't discuss it with me , " he said . " But then why should she ? She 's a mature lady . Am I surprised ? Only a little  --  Sorokinp230is n't so bad . He 's good-natured , virile , he 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could . What I feel is more like sympathy for her . But among the Chicago types she had to choose from , she might have done worse . " " Is n't she a Chicago type herself ? " " He 's a few years younger than Elfrida . " " Yes , she mentioned that . " " Well , there it is . Are they off on their honeymoon ? They ca n't go , I suppose . Not while Mason 3s still in trouble . " " Mason is very angry with his mother . " " Is he ? If he had n't shaken her up so much she might not have jumped into this . Going it alone was too hard for her . Well , Elfrida. . . she remarried . I dearly love my sister . " " She said that . But she was worried you would n't approve . " " Maybe I was standoffish with Sorokin . I doubt that he took much notice . Anyway , I meant no real harm . But why is Mason so miffed ? . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Mason came to her one day with a paperback from the drugstore and said she had to read it . It was a how-to book  --  how the middle-aged woman could manage by herself and be a well-adjusted widow . He put her on notice , she was supposed to keep a holding pattern . He brought her this manual as a Mother 's Day present . " " At least she did n't take that from him . " " No . I think that clinched it . When I saw her studying this paperback on how to be happy while sad , I was sure she 'd marry . And it 's foolish to ask why she did n't discuss this match with me . My views are as obvious as Mason 's . " " It seemed to me she did the smart thing . " " Well , of course . It was better not to let me put my prejudices on record . Then I 'd have to stand by them , she 'd feel hurt , et cetera , and she 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive , also , " said Vlada . " Well , there 's nothing wrong with a husband like the Judge . You said it yourself . I wish I could find one of those . He 's good-looking and amusing . He has a plan to ride a raft down a South American river . " " He told me about it . At the time , he planned to do it alone . Ip231ca n't picture Elfrida rushing through the jungles downstream like the African Queen , hanging on to her Samsonite luggage . She 's a little old for it . But then there 's nobody too old to be young . That 's the present outlook . Actually age has been on her mind , naturally it has , but the book Mason ordered her to read  --  she was supposed to go it alone like a brave modern mother  --  put her in a furious depression . She saw the handwriting on the nursing home wall . " " Say that she married in self-defense . She 's not a young girl like Lydia Lester . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked it over with her only brother . But she and I never could find the common premise . And maybe she thought the Judge would make Mason a good role model  --  an extrovert who drops from helicopters . Not like an unclewho goes fishing for porgies and falls in the drink . She suspectedme of being unsympathetic , of being put off by the boy 's resemblance to his father . But I did n't dislike Mason senior . He was the special kind of highly intelligent top-grade barbarian I grew up with  --  people like my own father and my uncles . People to whom I was affectionately attached . Elfrida 's opinion is that young Mason is n't as bad as other sons in her set . He thinks he 's one of the black street people , but at least he does n't burn out his veins with synthetic heroin , the stuff that has to be shot when it 's scalding . The addicts become paralyzed . Mason will never really hurt himself . He 's not a hijacker , kidnapper , terrorist . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he said , " You ca n't even talk about your poor sister without getting into broad social questions . That 's the worst of it . Now I suppose she 'll sell the house on the Cape and invest it in parachutes . " The apartment was filled with callers . Some of them came with a second purpose : They wanted to get their children out of thep232country . You could n't blame them for that . But how did one find sponsors , and where could you get dollars ? You had to have the dollars . Corde observed some of this . " Your mother was very fond of my daughter . She 's an excellent student . She wants to do molecularbiology ... " then pulling a chair closer , urgently whispering , glancing significantly at the Dean . Minna listened in her solemn way . You never knew what she was hearing or whether her large eyes looked at you or through or past you . No , but she saw everything , felt it intensely , took it all to heart . Parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody was refused . She said she would ask the Dean to read some of them . Corde said , " Spangler is expecting me . " " Yes , you should go out , " she said . " When is the car coming ? Yes , it 'll be good for you to have a talk with your old pal . But do n't stand waiting in the street . Promise you 'll stay in the lobby . Please .... " He took the packet from Alec Witt down with him , and had just time enough to see that it was stuffed with letters on his articles , mostly objecting , probably , alumni demanding that he be canned . Corde thought , I could do without crazy mail . Say what you liked about Miss Porson , she might be gross but her feminine instinct was to spare the Dean . You could n't expect such delicacy from the Provost . But then ( self-critical ) why look to anyone to spare you ? You did n't need to be spared at all , unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that right-minded ladies and gentlemen should temper the wind to you ( a vocation left you shorn ? ) . Some of the letters were addressed to him personally but Miss Porson had considered it necessary for the administration to see them . She had her own picture of the administration , a vision of the college hierarchy and of who owed what to whom . If you were Dean you reported to the Provost , who reported to the President , who went to the Board ... . Cremation or no cremation , a glistening day unfolded  --  businessas usual for the weather . Corde , still bothered by smoke in his lungs , cleared his throat as he hurried into Spangler 's limou/sine . Then the posh Intercontinental cafe and the big fragrance of the espresso machines . This time Dewey had taken a table by the window , warmed by the sun , an antidote to the horrible gloom of the crematorium . He was suavely solicitous  --  oh , what a smoothie Dewey had become in the great world ! In the indoor sunlight he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descending over the upswelling belly . He was belted beneath the sunny equator . There was only Corde to remember his skinny adolescence . " Poor Albert . I 'll order you a double Scotch . You were looking green in the mortuary . " " I had to go below and sign papers . " " Odd to see you in a foreign situation , so different from any other setting in the past . " " When you turned up , I had the opposite sensation . Familiarity . Do you remember after my mother 's funeral  --  we were still at Lakeview  --  youcame to the house ? " " No , my memory is dusty on this . " ( The little bastard . He was lying . But let him . ) " The living room was full of callers . You sat in a corner , behind everyone , and made faces at me . " Spangler was not pleased by this . " I do n't remember that . " " Yes , " said Corde . " You came to remind me of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle-class hypocrisy of mourning , and the whole bourgeois sham . " " It sounds as though you had n't forgiven me yet . " " I was angry with you , yes . " " I was an unpleasant kid , I admit . In those days I was the more eccentric one . Seriously , you could n't hold it against me . This was back in the late thirties . " Skinny , wretched , weak , crowing , angry , Dewey in those days was eager to deal blows left and right . No , of course you could n't hold it against him . " It 's just a recollection  --  you grimacing and being so kinky when I was grieving so hard , just back from the cemetery . It was one of those winter days of cast-iron gloom , nothing but gray ice . " " It was Chicago winter , all right . But while you 're **35;9100;TOOLONG in mountain regions . In the last few minutes of gray light , all the boonierats of 1st Plt shifted south , uphill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mity-mite while still keeping the hole and the machine tangentially in touch with the perimeter . Whiteboy manned the position closest to the hole . Gawd , he thought . You only have ta be lucky nough ta sit on somethin lahk that ta be-come famous . Ever'body in battalion knows that Ah discovered the secret openin' ta all the North Vietnamese Army 's supplyroutes inta I Corps . Shee-it , Ah hope that picture Mr. PIO took comes out . In the last minutes before blackness Whiteboy picked a board from the mity-mite crate and carved a crude plaque : WHITEBOY 'S MINEC . **29;9137;TOOLONG the dropping of the sun the temperature went from broil to cool . FO established new DTs and called in a series of H &; I targets . " Hey , L-T , " he said softly to an uneasy Brooks , " look at it this way ; at least we 're still keepin up the illusion there are two hundred of us out here . Nobody in their right mind would secure a noise maker like that in an AO like this with only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a hundred of us here . " Indeed the CP and 1st Plt consisted of only thirty-four men . Lamonte , George , Carrie , Caribski and the dog team had all left with 3d Plt . Brooks , his three RTOs , Doc , Minh , Cherry and Egan were at the center of the NDP , leaving twenty-six for guard . Thomaston and FO moved down and manned a position between 2d and 3d Sqds . Doc McCarthy teamed with Whiteboy . The thirteen positions with overlapping fields of fire nestled tightly in amongst the trees and brush . Each position put out two claymore mines . Up and down the trail , Egan and El Paso set two mechanical ambushes . Jax and Silvers set an MA on the ridge above the platoon . All of them silently cussed the mity-mite , cussed the noise , cussed the smell of gasoline and smoke , the acidic taste the air had acquired from the CS crystals , and Whiteboy for finding the hole in the first place . The men in the CP circle , joined now by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They sat in a knee-touching circle , the four radios at the center hissing an almost imperceptible white noise . Brooks sat at the highest point against the tree , with El Paso to his right and Cahalan to his left . Brown was next to Cahalan . Jax was next . He had crawled up for the meeting , intending to make an announcement . Egan was to his left , then Cherry , Doc and Minh . They spoke in voices so low , had it not been that they anticipatedp301many of each other 's comments they would never have understood the conversation . Cherry , as the newest member , found it difficult to follow the words in the dark . " Hey , Bro Jax , " El Paso whispered across the circle , " give me some teeth . I ca n't see you . " " Yo bes not be able to see this duke , " Jax smiled . " Ef yo see em , then so ken a gook . " " We got somethin big here , L-T , " Egan whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You ought a split , " Doc said toward Brooks . " You gettin too short for this shit . " " How many days , L-T ? " Brown whispered . " Thirteen en a wake-up if I decide to DEROS , " Brooks said . " I have n't decided yet . " " You should dee-dee , " El Paso said . " You owe it to yerself . " " I feel like we are on the heels of a major victory , " Brooks said . " We on the heels of a pipe dream , " Doc countered . " That aintnothin but a hole . If it 's more , dinks ai nt neva gon na let ya inthere . " They were all silent for several minutes . The mity-mite droned on . The radios hissed . Brooks had the uneasy thought that he had extended the last time for the wrong reason . He did not wish to repeat the mistake yet there was a gut feeling of being needed . These men were his men . They liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their friend . It meant a lot to Brooks . Yet still he could not decide . He said nothing . Cahalan broke the silence . " Hey , Eg , is it true you 're goina write a book ? " Egan and the others faced the darkness that emitted Cahalan 's voice . " Doc says you 're goina write the diary of a tunnel rat ... call it , The Grotto-Canal Diary . " They all chuckled . Jax rose to a squatting position . He rocked forward and back on his feet . He had been debating inwardly whether or not to express his prepared remarks . He let go . " We gowin seize power by force a arms , " his voice lamented in the darkness . " By war we gowin get our solution . Our task is to kill the world 's pigs , an of Jax gowin lead the revolution . " Jax remained with the group only one second more . No one answered him . He felt very alone in his disgust with the war and in his belief that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friends , he felt , was driving him away . He crawled hack to his guard position . Still they remained silent . Brooks grabbed his forehead and massaged his temples . Somehow , he thought , before I leave , I 've got to help straighten that man out . " Hey , " Brooks whispered , " let 's get into it . Cahalan. "  | " It 's a long report tonight , " Cahalan said and without hesitation he listed the day 's events , chronologically , statistically . He mentionedBravo 's location on each contact and the estimated size of the enemy force . Wherever possible he named the enemy unit and added what its usual structure should contain . He ran down the list of SKYHAWK companies , then the firebase bombardments , the activities of an enemy engaged by aircraft and finally his fragmented information about ARVN engagements in the AO south of the Khe Ta Laou . " How you keep all that in your head ? " Doc whispered . Brooks cut him off . " Doc , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sounding more professional than Cherry had ever heard him . " First , resupply tomorrow . I 've requested plasma . I need plasma . " Doc 's speech began quickening . " I want fifty bags . I want evera other sucka humpin a bag a blood en I want evera medic humpin five . Dig ? McCarthy . Where you at ? " " He 's over with Whiteboy , " Egan said . " You tell him five . Got that ? Five . " " I 'll tell him , " Egan assured Doc . " Second , " Doc whispered firmly at Brooks . " They all dehydrated . Everaone a em . You ca n't push a man so hard he droppin then expect him ta fight . What we gon na do today if we 'd run inta a hun'red-fifty dinks ? Huh ? You tell that mothafucka GreenMan he gon na have him eighty-fo V-S-I infantrymen from Alpha bein evacked , he ai nt careful . You gim me da mothafuckin hook . I 'll tell im . " Cherry smiled from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , touching him , feeling him punctuate his speech with jabbing arms . He wanted to say , you tell him , Doc , but he remained quiet . Without answering Doc , Brooks called , " Danny . " " I just want to say , I 'm goin back in that hole tomorrow . I want ta go back down with an E-T . We 're on ta somethin big . I do n't know if the dinks 'll let us in or not but I think it 's imperative we try . " " Concerning the hole , " Brooks said , " we 're going to have to wait to see what GreenMan and Old Fox want us to do . We 're going to resupply second tomorrow behind Delta . I think we 'll have to be up on six-three-six by ten-hundred hours . He wants us in that valley with a passion . " " That mothafucka , " Doc cussed , " he gon na burn these men up . It fo klicks minimum to that valley . " " Hey , " Brooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's any smoke . We may have to follow and find the rest of this complex . " Cherry wanted to join the conversation but he did not wish top303force himself upon them . " How extensive do you think this tunnel is ? " he asked . " That mothafucka go all the way to China , " Doc snarled . " Some people , " Minh whispered , " believe the tunnels go from the Ho Chi Minh Trail all the way to lowlands . " Cherry whistled soundlessly . " We 've never been able to break into the tunnels , " El Paso said . " Intelligence reports claim the dinks got an elaborate network . " " The trails of the Ho Chi Minh , " Cahalan recited , " appear to be an almost endless series of well-engineered dirt roads . They are highly maintained by coolie labor and often tunnels cut through mountains . " No one questioned Cahalan as to where or how he knew . Cahalan always knew these things . " Throughout the maze of interlacing routes , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where weapons , ammunition and food are unloaded and broken down for redistribution to units within the south . We are most likely on a branch line . " Brooks rubbed his scalp . Cahalan , he thought . That man is indispensable . Brooks attempted to picture Cahalan 's description superimposed on a topo map of the Khe Ta Laou . Where and how should he move his men ? " They say , " Brown intruded , " the dinks got everything we got . They got trucks , they got howitzers . They even got helicopters . " " No way , " Doc challenged him . " Yes Sir . I shit you not . " Cahalan 's vpice again entered the darkness . " Intelligence teams have reported spotting several helicopters painted all black and without identification . No one has ever confirmed or denied the reports . The birds are either the NVA 's or the CIA 's . " " Do you really think this tunnel might go all the way to Laos ? " Cherry asked . " It 's not that far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen klicks from Laos . " Cherry was impressed . He had not pictured them being that near the Ho Chi Minh Trail . " I do not think we can ever get into these tunnels , " Minh whispered . " I do not think we should try . If we find they are so extensive as you say , your government will withdraw . They will say Vietnam is a lost cause . " " I thought you wanted us out , " Cherry said . " Yes , " Minh answered . " Out . Your army , your people out . But we must always have your friendship , your moral support and your materiel . " " Five years ago , " Egan said contemptuously , " they said thep304dinks owned the countryside and everything but the center cities . Now most of it is ours . Two years ago they said the dinks owned the night . Now we own it . Now they say the dinks own the underground . We 'll get in there . We 'll own that too before long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said softly . " I fight along your side as a brother but I do not like what I see . I do not like what you do to my country . Your money makes us poor . The more of your money that comes into my country , the more are my people forced into poverty . " " That do n't ee-ven make sense , " Brown said . " Oh yes , " Minh answered . " Before a man could make 1000 piasters a month and feed his family . Your money comes and prices go up . Now he makes 10,000 piasters a month and he must steal to even feed himself . " " Well , we 'd be pretty incredibly naive to believe we have n't fucked with the economy here , " Egan conceded for Brown . " You see , " Minh continued , " you can not win this war for us . " His voice was very soft . " If you win then we are conquered . We have been conquered many times before . Each time we rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our blood . And you will be driven out . After you are here a very long time , you will find we are a poor country . There will be nothing to keep you here and you will want to leave . Then we will rise up and drive you out . " " What the hell do you think we 're doin here ? " Brown whispered angrily . " We do n't want your country . " " We 're here to establish peace , " Egan said . " We 're not here puttin up permanent bases . We ai nt even tryin to defeat North Vietnam . " " Yeah , " Brown carried on . " We do n't care what you guys do . You can be free to do whatever you like . Soon as we stop the dinks . " Minh was overwhelmed by their retorts . Cherry attempted to come to his rescue . " Fighting for peace is like fucking for virginity , " he said . It had been a cliche at college and everyone in the peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , " Egan said . No one else commented . Egan 's words were final . Now Cherry felt shunned from the group . " I mean ... " Cherry began after a pause . " No it 's not , " Egan repeated flatly . " That 's a lamebrain 's oversimplificationand the analogy does n't hold . And it does n't hold because you do n't know what peace is . It is possible to fight for peace , to defend oneself , to deter or stop an aggressor . Fuck your pat little phrases . " " We 've made a commitment to your country , Minh , and to your people , " Brooks added . " We 've committed ourselves to guarantee you the right to choose your own government . My governmentp305claims your country is under attack by forces organized , trained and equipped by another country . How do you feel about that ? " " You Americans , " Minh said softly , respectfully , " sometimes you are blind . " " Yeah , " Cherry chimed in . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own country that 's attacking em . Ah , I mean ... " " Look around shithead , " Egan growled . " Who the fuck you think were fightin ? ARVNs ? " " Well , " Cherry came right back repeating another idea he had heard earlier , " their way of life is a lot closer to communism than it is to our way anyway . Maybe we should let the communists have this place . " " What do you base that on ? " Egan said . " You know . The way they live , kind of all on top of each other sharing everything and their religions and all . It stresses the group more than the individual . " " Would you say communism is more in style with their living style than is western democracy ? " Egan baited him . " Yeah , I would , " Cherry said . " Would you say that federalism , you know , a powerful central government , stresses the individual more than the society or the society more than the individual ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling Egan preparing a semantic trap . " I think so too , " Egan said . " El Paso ? " " Generally the larger the population a government controls , the more it must deal with the people as a mass than as individuals . And the more powerful a government is the more it controls the people governed . " " Do you agree with that ? " Egan asked Cherry . " Yes , I would , but ... " " Do western multi-party governments tend to control their peoplemore or less than one-party systems such as in Russia or China ? " " Less . " " And the party in power , " Egan continued , " can it be toppled more easily in a multi-party system or in a one-party cell-system ? " " Multi-party . " " Then the government in a multi-party system must not have as great control over the people as does the government in a single party communist system . True ? " " True . " " Now , in Vietnam 's cultural tradition , do the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  | " No , " Minh answered the question . " It is not good for the national government to control the village . " " Then our way must be closer to their traditional way than would be communism , " Egan concluded . " But they 're all Vietnamese , " Cherry protested . " They 're Vietnamesejust like the ARVNs . " " Eg , mi hermano , " El Paso said calmly . " Your argument is good but flawed . When people say the traditional culture here is more adaptable to communism than to something else , that something else is not democracy but capitalism . Perhaps , Cherry , what you propose is a socialist system . It is not quite true , also , that these people are all Vietnamese . " In his many months in the jungle El Paso had found hundreds of hours to read . He read Vietnamese histories and he read the current events affecting Vietnam . He now launched into a detailed historical account of how various peoples arrived in Vietnam and from where the population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from China to settle the regions about Hanoi and Haipong and how other peoples migrated east from south central Asia to settle the areas of Cambodia and the Mekong Delta . Still others drifted west from Polynesia . " Never , " El Paso stated emphatically , " have the people of the North and the people of the South been one people . They have always fought each other . The early unifications of Vietnaminvariably refer to the uniting of segments above the 17th parallel . Hell , there were n't hardly any people south of the 17th until the 14th century . This land was empty , emptier than America when the white man came . " Cherry was surprised by how thoroughly El Paso knew the subject . El Paso continued for a short time , then said , " We often call our opponents Viet Cong and we think of them as independent rebellious South Vietnamese . I do not think this is the case . All our contacts are with North Vietnamese regulars . This is part of the confusion and political myth of the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to justify their invasion of the South . " Minh remained silent through El Paso 's remarks . Cherry acknowledgedit with a quiet , " I see . " Doc wearily asked , " What all that got to do with anythin ? " They were all very tired . The droning of the mity-mite did not allow them for even one moment to believe their position was uncompromised . The excitement of discovering and speculating on the tunnel had dissipated and apprehension filled the void . Moonlight seeped into the black above as the moon began itsp307late ascent . Thin clouds were forming at a very high altitude and the moonlight reflected off their earth facing surfaces . " Hey , " Brooks said , " it 's getting late . Get some sleep . We 'll have other times to discuss these things . " Cherry lay on his back in the dirt , his face flushed , feverish . The night had become cold and damp . Doc and Minh lay next to each other to Cherry 's left . Egan was shoulder to shoulder with him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L-T and Brown snuggled into the crotch of a stubby tree . All shivered with cold and their compromisedposition . Beneath a thin poncho liner Cahalan monitored the radios , checking 1st Plt squads , the other platoon CPs and reporting to the battalion forward TOC on Firebase Barnett . Cherry shivered severely . " Oh God . No , " his whisper demanded . " Go Away ! " The soldier had returned . Cherry 's thoughts sped . He was completely exhausted . His arms and legs ached . The burns and scratches were not healing , but festering , inflamed and slowly oozing sticky thick liquid . Cherry shut his eyes . The NVA soldier moved quickly in Cherry 's imagination . He moved quickly , determined to get his face into the sight of Cherry 's M-16 , determined to look straight up the barrel , through the sights , into Cherry 's eyes . The enemy 's head enlarged , his eyes , set deep in hollow haunted sockets , gleamed . A smirk rolled across the man 's mouth . The mouth opened large , larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashing . Cherry tensed about the trigger , began squeezing , squeezingwith both hands , ten fingers , the headmouth became larger , the tongue whipping madly , saliva splashing Cherry squeezing the rifle exploding , flashing .. . Oh fuck . I got ta get that man outa my head . Please Dear Lord , please . . . Cherry had sat up without being aware of having moved . The jungle rule  --  Always Be Quiet  --  had seeped into his subconscious . He had not even awakened Egan . Cherry tightened the poncho liner about his neck and shoulders . His face remained hot . God . God ? What god ? He forced himself to think of something other than the dead NVA . Use your brain , he told himself . It can get you through . He searched his mind . He thought of Linda but the thought would not stick . He thought about school . Images dashed through his mind , a classroom , a lecture hall . Cherry forced the thought on . He wanted to sleep . So badly he wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes had recorded several years before he had arrived in Nam . It was autumn in Vermont , the peak of the foliage-seeker season . The sun had set and the sky was very dark and clear . Vic was driving the pickup truck with their moto-cross motor/cycles in the back . Jim , Cherry paused , Jim he thought , that was me : I rode shotgun . They had been returning from a backhills course , coming down a twisting side road . From the crest of a mountain peak they looked down for several miles to Interstate 91 . The roadwayand numerous adjacent capillaries were jammed with automobiles . The reds of taillights and the beams from headlights illuminated arteries and veins on the blackness . Cherry could see the image clearly in his mind , could see all the tiny cells traveling through the organism , giving the body life . The organism is a parasite , Cherry thought , forced the thought to expand . The earth is a parasite sucking life from a far more complex animal which in its turn lives in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the surface of a very immense planet , a planet which is tiny- and insignificant in its own universe . God , Cherry smiled to himself , to have a thought to play with without that fucken gook stickin his head into it . Cherry pursued the idea . Someone on that immense insignificant planet has captured the animalin which the earth is a parasite . It is a doctor or scientist . Cherry could see the scientist working in his white lab coat . He could see it all now . It opened like The Book of Revelations before him . The scientist was operating on the animal to find the cause of its sickness . To the scientist the earth is the size of a molecule . To the earth the pathologist shall be forever unknown . After all , Cherry smiled , we have not yet explored even neighboring molecules much less the organ within which the earth feeds . The perspective from earth to intestinal wall is unimaginably vast . If there is a wall at the outer boundary of the universe , what lies beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A surgeon ? Cherry laughed to himself . If I can imagine all this , he asked himself , is not my imagination larger than all of it ? Cherry was sitting upright , still shivering . The moon crested the mountain ridges and flooded the upper canopy . It was full . Flat colorless light fell into the valley and diffused in ground mist . The jungle floor on the side of Hill 636 remained black . Cherry looked around . The sound of the mity-mite throbbed in his ears . A guard on the perimeter coughed . Got ta stop thinkin . I got ta sleep . I ought a jerk off . I wish I was with Linda . Oh please stop . World stand still . That 's a fuckin order . Oh God , I wish I could plug my brain into a tape recorder and look at the results after I DEROS . Maybe it would make sense then . As the moon rose a thin shaft of light penetrated the canopy . A glint triggered Egan 's nightmare . A sapper was by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moon beams sparkled upon thep309blade as the dark foe raised the huge knife higher , aiming , cocking , striking down toward his eyes .. . Egan snapped up , spun and landed on his fingertips and toes , I i ke a cat , ready to leap . Adrenaline fired him awake alert paranoid . He smelled the night , listened to the night , swept a paw into the might . To let the machete fall would be to accept his own death . " Somebody said if you ate it , you 'd either get high as a kite or sick as a dog . So I ate it . " " Just blow the fucken claymore . You got movement out there ? Blow the fucken claymore . " " I ca n't . There ai nt no C-4 in it . " " Numbnuts , where the motherfuck is the C-4 ? " Steve Hoover quietly removed another grenade from his gear . He could n't believe what he was hearing and he was pissed . " I ate it . I ate it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hump , Man , I had ta do somethin . Maybe I 'd get sick see ? Then Doc 'd have ta medevac me . I 'd get medevacked see ? That 's good . Or I 'd get high . That 's good . Either way it had to come out good . " " Fuck you . Just fuck you . Go out there and blow yerself . When did you eat the fuckin C-4 ? " " This afternoon . " " Did you get high ? " " No . " " Are you sick ? " " No . " " Fuck you . You whore sonavabitch . " Hoover whispered seething , staring into the jungle . " Well at least I put out my claymore . Where the hell 's yours ? " Numbnuts whined . " I 'm goina stick mine up your ass . You hear anything more ? " " No . " " Go over an tell the L-T we got movement and that our claymoresare fucked up and wo n't blow . " " Maybe it was just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you too . Of all the guys in this fuckin platoon , I got ta get stuck with some dude who 's got a three word vocabulary . " " ' Fuck you ' is two words bat shit . Now go over and check out the L-T and see if Jax heard anything and do n't make any noise . " " Where 's the CP ? " " Wait here . I 'll go . " Hoover began crawling away from Numbnuts . " Hey , a ... " " What ? "  | " I ai nt really sure I heard anything . Maybe we should just wait . " " Listen mothafucker , you either heard somethin or you did n't . " " I do n't know . " " What time is it ? " " Three-thirty . " " You fucken bat shit . " Hoover shook his head and crawled back to his position . He lay alert and strained his ears trying to differentiatethe night sounds . The mity-mite and artillery rumbling came from behind them . A slight breeze rustled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he snarled after eight or ten minutes . " You listen close . I 'm sackin . You do n't fuck with me unless you hear somethin . You hear somethin or even think you hear somethin , get me up . Get a fix on the direction . Keep your fuckin eyes pinned open and if I get killed cause a you , so help me I 'll come back an haunt you till the day I die . How much C-4 did you eat ? " " Just a little . Tee-tee . I did n't want to get too high or too sick . I got the rest in my ruck . " " How long you been in the Nam , Man ? " " Four ... over four months . I got held up at Cam Ranh for a while cause they did n't have a unit for me . " " Four months in Nam and yer already eatin your claymores . Man , that stuff ai nt good for you . An Jack , you do n't go gettin high up here . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Song Bo . There 's dinks out there . You so fuckin dumb , I ca n't ... What was that ? " " I did n't hear nuthin . " " Shut up . Somethin 's out there . " " You see ... " " Shut up . " Hoover keyed his radio handset breaking squelch on all the radios . He did not speak . He rolled slowly to his left . In his right hand he grasped a frag . Very slowly he worked the pin out . Very gradually he slid from his position and moved to alert Silvers and Jax . Numbnuts was petrified . He cocked his M-79 . He squeezed the claquer firing device on his defunct claymore . Even the blasting cap did not explode . Sweat ran down his face . He shook nervously . Hoover did not return . Numbnuts fired his thumper . Whooaaccck , the round blew from the barrel . Then KaBuaccck , the small grenade exploded . Numbnuts was sure he could hear the enemy scatter . The mechanical ambush up the trail triggered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left boonierats tossed frags . Claymore mines exploded before half-a-dozen positions . Boonierats could hear NVA dragging bodies through the heavy growth . They fired at the noises . Brown at the CP called the firebase and within minutesp311pre-arranged DTs were flattening and burning the vegetation in a wide circumference about 1st Pit . The fusillade gradually died , exhausted , numbed by a lack of return fire .

They had argued their best . Cherry did not fully understand . Generally , 1st Plt believed it was a mistake , felt they were victimized into committingan error . The entire day had been erroneous and demoralizing . It had been the kind of day champions lose to cellar dwellers and honor students fail easy exams . When the 1st Plt of Alpha blew the tunnel at 1300 hours and all that ground caved in the situation seemed perfectly normal-all fucked up . No one had fallen asleep before first light . After the Numbnutsinitiatedmad minute , the perimeter went on 100 percent alert . Cherry and Egan crawled outward and reinforced Whiteboy 's squad . The night became colder . Ground mist rising , flooding the dark crevices between already black jungle , drained heat from boonierat bodies and dampened clothes and poncho liners . All pairs cuddled , side-to-side , back-to-back , shivering , awake , miserable , exhausted . Throughout the night the mity-mite and distant omnipresent artillery bursts rumbled and echoed . Black mist changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canopy silhouetted menacinglyagainst the dull sky . First light dispelled the night . Half of 1st Plt fell asleep . They slept past sunrise at 0639 and they slept through i spectacular show as the sun broke over the east ridges and peaks and splashed and refracted in the sky turning the clouds red and the sky purple . " Only in Nam , " Egan smiled at the sky . Half the platoon slept on through routine morning activities , slept until the sun burned away the mist and clouds.  |p316The  other half did not sleep . Egan rose at the earliest sign of light and silently prepared his web gear for morning patrols . There was a feeling of relief and happiness amongst the waking , relief that day had arrived . During Nam nights boonierats often feared someonesomehow would devise a method of eliminating daylight and daytime would never again arrive . It was always a relief when the sky changed and a boonierat could see his brothers still there . Doc Johnson and El Paso moved silently through the dispersed squads checking and accounting for the L-T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked here and there . A thumbs-up sign or a nod were the only responses . Doc McCarthy delivered a daily-daily pill to every soldier , a tiny white pill designed to inhibit falicipreum and volvax malaria . Everyone accepted a pill but half the pills found their way , with a wish , over shoulders . It would be better to be medevacked out with malaria than to get wasted in the valley . Egan gathered a small team for a first light check . They disassembledthe down-trail mechanical ambush , then patrolled west , uphill . The higher MA had blown . Artillery rounds had smashed small craters into the jungle . There were no bodies , no blood trails , no signs . It was as if no one had been there last night . The patrol returned . " Oh , Man , " Hoover chuckled to Jax and Silvers . " You shoulda seen Numbnuts last night . That fucker says he ate the C-4 from his claymore so he 'd get sick . Then he says he hears somethin . I tell him he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Man , you shoulda seen that dumb fuck . Scared shitless . When I skyed he was near cryin . I know there ai nt nothin there and I knew what that dumb fuckin shit was goina do . " Egan returned to his and Cherry 's position . He broke out his C-rat can stove , a canteen cup , water , a piece of C-4 and coffee packets . Cherry woke , shook his head , looked at Egan through bleary eyes . " Twenty-two and a wake-up , " Egan announced cheerfully . Egan washed as best he could using the corner of a towel and a C-rat tin of water . He concocted a breakfast of virtually inedible C-rat ham and eggs , doctoring the yellowish muck with peach jam , a dash of Tabasco sauce and several splashes of coffee . Egan mixed the mush with his bayonet then ate it with a plastic spoon . The sight of it being eaten turned Cherry 's stomach . Cherry ate a cold can of pork slices , a tin of crackers with cheese spread , eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last can of fruit cocktail . Egan cleaned and packed his ruck carefully checking the tightness of every strap . Cherry crammed his gear into the pocket of his pack , as before , then sat on it . Egan re-tied and tightened his bootlaces , checked his web gear , cleaned his ammo and weapon and thenp317brushed his teeth . Cherry dusted the cover of his M-16 with his hand and sat waiting , expecting word to come to move in zero five . " Man , " Egan shook his head . " You 're a mess . Look at you . I never seen a dude get so filthy in so short a time . You need a shave . " " What 's this lifer crap ? " Cherry barked back snidely . " Want me to spit-shine my boots too ? " " I want you to be clean , Asshole , " Egan snarled . All about them boonicrats were moving now . Moneski led 2d Sqd out on patrol . Brooks talked with the GreenMan , and FO called the FDC on Barnett with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a sign of the one hundred and fifty NVA soldiers seen by aircraft two days earlier . The mity-mite continued pumping and the hole continued accepting the smoke . Above the valley and as far west as the Laotian border helicopters searched for smoke rising . None was spotted . Brown called forward supply with a coded , up-dated request list . " . . . charlie-charlie-uniform one , delta-deltajulietone , alpha-alpha-foxtrot eight , delta . . . " He spoke on and on into the handset . On the firebase a supply clerk translated the message into meaningful figures on a cage-sheet , a list to which only the quantity needed to be added . Brooks talked to the Old Fox about the hole . He radioed 2d and 3d Pits and instructed them to return to the LZ on Hill 636 for resupply . He told them the CP and 1st would rendezvous with them at 1300 . Routine activity continued and most of the boonierats became bored and simply rested in the shade . " Jax , " Egan said excitedly , " let me take yer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool . " Bro , yo ai nt gowin back down there , is yo ? " Jax asked , incredulousshock beaming from his tired eyes . " Right on , Jax , " Egan gleamed , spun and trotted toward the tunnel opening . " Oh , Man , " Jax shook his head . " Dat Pucka crazy . " " Better en havin em tell either you or me to go down there , " Silvers whispered . At the opening Egan stood in a cluster of CP soldiers , Whiteboy , Thomaston and Cherry . He had tied off his pants legs at the crotch and knees and bloused them tightly about his ankles . Over his torso he wore a T-shirt , a long-sleeve jungle sweater and a fatigue blouse . As additional protection against the tear gas crystals in the hole he wore gloves and a hat . Like the day before he donned a gas mask and carried two flashlights and two .45s . Cherry secured the rope about his waist and Egan plunged in . The trip down was identical to the earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flashlight beam . Egan turned it off and proceeded in the dark . Slowly down . Deeper.  |p318Dee|per  . It was almost routine . Whiteboy gave three sharp tugs on the line indicating Egan was 100 feet out . Egan pulled once . He forced himself left against the tunnel wall , held the flashlight in his right hand , extended it to the opposite wall . He paused a moment , aimed a .45 down the tunnel and clicked the beam on , one two , off . His eyes registered an empty tunnel . Egan proceeded repeating the lighting at fifteen- to twenty-foot intervals . At 145 feet Whiteboy jerked the line four times . Egan yanked back . He should be in the small room . He turned the light on . The tunnel continued down . Egan inched lower , flicking the light at random . No room . At 170 feet he was stopped by a 250-pound bomb . He could hear digging sounds on the other side. 3d Pit had spent a restless night also . They had backed themselves into a small gorge after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team at the top , LPs on the flanks and three fighting positions across the front . He placed his platoon CP at the center in a thin natural trench . The dog handler and the tracker spent the night with the ambush team as far from Lt. Caldwell as possible . " That mothafucka 's dead , " the handler passed sentence on the platoon leader . " He gon na wish he nevah saw the light a day . What kinda man let a dog die ? Just let him whimper en die en not even send a squad afta the dink who done it . Just turn around en run . What kinda man is that ? I 'll tell you . A daid one . " His feeling penetrated almost every boonierat in 3d . A feeling of total disbelief and disgust had grabbed them all . " Boy Asshole done it again , " they cussed . " Where we gon na move to if we hit . That coward 's fuckin us . " The hate had not been easy to sleep with . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Rafe Ridgefield walked point . Nahele with his M-60 was at slack . They moved out of the small gorge and onto a little used trail , perhaps an animal trail , Rafe thought . He led them southwest around behind Hill 636 . Still they found no indication of the one hundred and fifty NVA . They began climbing toward the peak . Ridgefield moved slowly , cautiously , pausing for a break every ten to fifteen minutes . Various thoughts were accumulating in his head , assembling themselves into a ... Da-da ! DA-DA ! NEW AND UPROARIOUS RADIO PROGRAM FOR ALL MY MARVELOUS LISTENERS OUT THERE IN RADIOLAND . Ridgefield paused in very heavy vegetation to assess how to proceed . Behind him Nahele sat down and lit a cigarette . Ridgefield studied his map and checked his compass . He climbed forward three paces and mounted the prone carcass of a thick dead teak tree.  |p319Ile  stood on the trunk and stared into the erratic green leaf wall of i he jungle with the thousand irregular black shadows under palm bonds and behind branches . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes in the vine masses , into the pockets where all light was excluded , blocked by moist living vegetation high above and layer upon layer of dead rotting support entanglementbelow . Older life supporting new life , he thought . The dead supporting the living in ever increasing heights of jungle , old trees dying , smothered and strangled beneath ever newer covers of green , spreading , reaching for the sun , climbing over the decaying structure , weighing heavily upon disintegrating branches , dying and decomposing as each new layer smothered the one below until the substructure weakened and the weight increased to the point of collapse . Ridgefield stared at the vegetation . A supporting limb snapped . A slow-motion avalanche of green crashed as a section of canopy imploded . He jumped down , squatted . Behind him others sought cover . He stared into the vegetation . It shook as if the earth below had opened its jaws and eaten a huge chunk of life . Ridgefield looked into the new wall , into the new life growing from the old , and he understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he jumped back onto the tree trunk and searched the black voids and the greenness for a trail to make the climb to the peak easier . As he stared directly into one black nothingness its center flashed bluewhite , a perfect circle , a blinding muzzle flash from within the depths of the void . He never saw anything again . " How the fuck did a bomb get down there ? " El Paso questioned . " How the fuck do I know ? " Egan shrugged . " Danny , are you sure it 's a bomb ? " Brooks asked breaking from his radio report to the GreenMan . " You fuckin guys think I 'm makin it up ? Fuck it . Go down and look for yourselves . " " What happened to the room ? " Whiteboy asked . " I do n't fuckin know , " Egan growled . " Well Gawd A'mighty , a room caint just dis-ay-pear . " " Well the fuckin thing just dis-ay-peared . " " GreenMan wants us moving , " Brooks stopped the questioning . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , " Egan shouted . " Ya caint blow mah hole , " Whiteboy protested . " We got ta dig it out , " Egan said . " Send three of us down to dig a room before the bomb . Then we can dig the bomb out . " " Ah couldint fit in thaht hole , " Whiteboy lamented . " If Ah could Ah 'd go down there with ya , Eg. "  |p320El  Paso took the hook back from Brooks . He radioed GreenMan 's RTO and explained the situation and said they had three volunteers to go back down . He explained what they wanted to do and what they believed , speculated , the tunnel would lead to . Brooks took the hook and talked to GreenMan again . He asked for a day . Denied . Six hours . Denied . Two hours . Denied . " Aw , they stickin it to us ah-gain , " Whiteboy grumbled walking off and kicking a burnt-out smudge pot . " We 're gettin fucked , L-T , " Egan complained . " Blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wire and two cases of C-4 , Egan re-entered the shaft . He was in about fifty feet when word of Ridgefield 's death reached the CP . On the ground above , 1st Pit packed up and prepared to move out . Egan and the hole were the only things keeping them from going . " Ca n't they signal him to hurry up ? " Numbnuts whined to Cherry . " We 'll be the last ones to resupply . " " So what ? " Cherry said . He was very tense . Numbnuts ' whine irritated him . " So what ? ! " Numbnuts cried . " We 'll get all the leftovers . Them others 'll go through all the Cs and take all the good meals . We 'll be stuck with Ham and Lima Beans . " " Wow , Dude ! Here a man from the company gets wasted and all you think about is lima beans . " Egan 's progress was slowed by the encumbrance of the explosives . He crawled forward , tired of the tunnel now that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its secrets never revealed . Now it was just a hole in the ground . He casually searched the sides for sealed junctions and found none . When he reached 170 feet the bomb stopped him again . He scraped and dug about it and packed both cases of explosives in pockets between the bomb and the dirt . He implanted two electrical blasting caps , wired them and unreeled as he backed out . At the top he was greeted by Brooks who told him about Ridgefield . No matter how many times it happened the death of a boonierat seized his stomach and twisted it . " Fuck it , " he whispered . " Do n't mean nothin. " 2d Plt had reached and secured the LZ . The first resupply helicopter was landing on the peak only 150 meters west . Brooks , Whiteboy and Egan ran the wire across 1st Plt 's NDP and up the ridge . Moneski and the 2d Sqd had already begun the hump west , uphill , toward the LZ when the demolition trio shouted , " Fire-inthe-hole . Fire-in-the-hole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The C-4 exploded muffled . The earth shook violently . It was impossible to tell if the bomb exploded . The earthp321continued to rumble sending tremors throughout 636 , then a 20 x 25 foot rectangular area of surface , including a section of the trail they had ascended yesterday and defended last night , collapsed , sunk straight down twelve feet , filling a subterranean room almost eighty feet below the surface . Normally resupply day was a skate , a day the command cut the Ioonierats some slack . Resupply day meant mail and packages and news items and time to relax and reorganize . Normally there was time to prepare a meal and eat something other than cold C-rations , time to clean up and possibly change clothes , time  --  between helicoptercomings and goings  --  to be noisy . There had been times when Old Zarno , the battalion sergeant major , had come out to the field with an entire kitchen force and the boonierats of Alpha were served a hot meal on the LZ . One time , up by Firebase Maureen , the resupply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent out six cases of ice cream cups packed in dry ice . That was an exceptional resupply . Then there was the resupply during the monsoon operation in the southern A Shau , when no helicopters could fly for seven days because of dense fog and Alpha was totally out of food . No extras arrived . Just food and batteries kicked out the hack of a C-130 cargo plane and parachuted down . The boonierats had had to search the jungle for the pallets for twelve hours . It was torture but life was at stake and resupply was blessed and life saving . The resupply on the 16th of August was neither a skate nor an emergency. 2d Plt had arrived at the summit of Hill 636 after a short hump from their NDP . Immediately they set to work , one squad cutting and clearing the LZ while the other two squads provided security . Small trees , brush and bamboo were hacked apart with machetes , and these , along with the loose branches and shattered debris from blowing down the larger trees with C-4 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the LZ to insure they would not be swept up into the helicopter rotors . Tree trunks and heavy limbs were tugged aside . The security squads busied themselves clearing Fields of fire about the perimeter . Hands blistered . The sun peaked . The temperature rose . The sun baked down on the cleared hilltop and the exposed earth dried and became dusty . Boonierats shed their shirts and continued working . The first two log birds arrived , one behind the other . The boonierats unloaded seventy cases of C-i ations , batteries for the company 's fifteen radios and heavy loads of M-60 belts , fragmentation grenades and new M-16 magazines and cartridges . No mail . " Shee-it , " Alex Mohnsen cussed . The supplies were stacked beside the landing , one and the clearing squad becamep322the breakdown squad . Quickly they resupplied , confiscating extra canned fruit and meat slices and tins of pound cake . Grudgingly they broke down and arranged distribution of the supplies . The temperature continued to climb. 3d Plt arrived after having carried Ridgefield 's body and gear up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought the body and extra ruck and weapon to the edge of the LZ . The body was wrapped in a poncho and the legs from the knees down hung out . " That of mothafucker , " Nahele said lamely to Snell and McQueen , " he sure 's hell heavy . " " The fucker 'd a done the same for you , " Snell babbled back . Ridgefield 's detail became 3d Plt 's breakdown squad . The others expanded and secured the perimeter . Lieutenant Caldwell watched and directed his platoon 's detail as he talked cheerfully to the civilian correspondent , Caribski , and the PIO escort officer , Lt. Carrie . " Ah , you know , " Caldwell said officially , " it 's a terrible thing when one of your men gets zapped . " Carrie pretended to listen but actually he was concentrating on four men standing about fifteen feet behind and to one side of Caldwell . They were Lamonte , George , the dog handler and McQueen . Lamonte seemed to be helping the dog handler prepare a letter or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caldwell said . " Sometimes they ca n't always see the reasoning behind command decisions but they 're a good bunch . " Caribski also paid Caldwell only partial attention . Several of the soldiers from 2d Plt 's detail were wisecracking about his muttonchopsideburns and his hair which was long and completely covered his ears . He was a large man , heavier than most boonierats . He looked strong . Most soldiers considered civilian journalists to be a weird lot . So few went to the field they were always an object of curiosity . For many , flying from Saigon to Camp Eagle was going to the boonies . Very seldom did a civilian actually stay in the bush for days and of those who did only a small percent sat and listened . Most journalists had strong political leanings and tended to lead conversations , tended to get the boonierats to say what they themselveswanted to hear . Caribski was different . He was a cross of both worlds . He was an ex-GI , ex-Viet Vet . He had humped a ruck before . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing . Some soldiers despised him for My Lai but in Alpha he earned general respect . He had talked and listened and humped . When the third log bird came in with clothes from the company fund and sundry materials but still no mail and then left with Lt. Carrie and Caribski and Ridgefield 's body , the disgust thickened. 1st Plt and the company CP reached the LZ on 636 by midafternoon , hot , sluggish , disgusted like the rest . They had one hourp323to resupply before the back bird , the helicopter which would come to remove all the unused and returnable items , came in and resupplywas over . Hastily they removed C-ration meals from cases then cans from boxes . They sorted through the meals grabbing ten then discarding those disliked if a suitable replacement could be found . " Ham and Limas ! Ham and Limas ! " Numbnuts shouted . " I hate ham and lima beans . Hey , Cherry , I 'll trade ya three ham and limas for one can of fruit . Aw , come on . How bout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than mothers en beans ... Aw no , I a'ready got three meatballs en beans . " The company fund clothes had been picked over too , before 1st Plt arrived . Only forty sets had come out and all forty sets , clean though worn , had been distributed . Forty sets of filthy fatigues lay piled ready for back bird withdrawal . The supply teams had not sent out any clean socks . Egan secluded himself on one side of the LZ . He had rummaged through the filthy fatigues and removed an untorn set about the right size . Anything was better than his CS crystal-infested clothes from the tunnel . His skin burned in hundreds of places . Egan changed quickly , powdered his feet , put on a clean pair of socks he had had in his ruck , sat back and pulled out the letter he had been writing to Stephanie. 8-16  --  I 'm going to have to give this to the doorgunner in half an hour so I 'll be brief . You 've been on my mind a lot . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect to be out of the army in three or four more . I want to see you . I never knew how deeply you touched me , how much you 'd come to mean to me until now . The thought of seeing you again is driving me mad . We had a lot of good times and some bad . I do n't know why I always had to be leaving but I think my desire to wander has been satiated by my time here . I feel funny writing you now , again , after so long , but how could I have written before when I did n't know how long it would be before I was out . Stephanie , if you can , please say I may come to see you . All my love , DanielEgan folded the letter , slid it into the envelope , sealed it , addressed it and wrote FREE on the stamp corner . He strode toward Isi PIt 's ( ' P , found Cherry and said , " Hey , when the bird comes in ,  |p324go  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mail for 1st Pit . And , ah , give this to the doorgunner with the outgoing mail , okay ? " " Why yo ask the man ta do that fo ? " Jax said from behind Egan . " Of all us wid interest , ai nt none got mo interest then yo . Yo the platoon sergeant , yo fine . Maybe she wrote yo , this time . " Egan pulled the letter back from Cherry and walked away . " Problem wid that man , " Jax said to Cherry , " wid his woman , he doan know where he stan . " On the other side of the LZ Doc and El Paso were listening to Lamonte and George describe their day with 3d Pit . " I can see why they call him Boy Asshole , " Lamonte said . " Man , he would n't even let the dog handler go up an put the dog out of its misery . " " I think they shoulda had a medevac come in for it , " George said . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You guys better watch out for him . " " He do Rafe ? " Doc asked intensely . " Naw , I do n't think that was his fault , " Lamonte answered . " Kinderly said Ridgefield was on the wrong trail . Got crossed up someplace . White wanted ta have a bird come in with a hoist so we would n't have ta carry him but Boy Asshole would n't even request one . He just turned the platoon around just like he did when the dog got it and he had us runnin away . I thought Nahele 'd blow his ass off . " He 's an asshole , Man , " George said . " I think you 're goina have trouble ever gettin another scout dog team ta work with this company . " Brooks came over to the group , excused himself and very apologeticallytold Lamonte he had to confiscate his film . " L-T , I already gave it to Lt. Carrie , " Lamonte said . Brooks pursed his lips . " I know Sir , it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got his head up his ass . " Brooks shook his head slowly , shrugged his shoulders and winked , " Does n't mean anything , " he said . " Hey , both of you . Thanks very much for coming out with us . It makes a lot of us feel good to have you here . " When Brooks returned to the CP Lamonte said , " He 's one in a million . That man 's got his shit together . " " Right on , Bro , " El Paso said , " Where you going now ? " " I do n't know , " Lamonte said . " We 'll be in for two days to writeour stories then maybe we 'll go out with 2d of the three-two-seventh . " " You really give the film to Carrie ? " George asked Lamonte . " Fuck no ! I told him you gave it to the L-T. "  |p325Cherry  , Egan and Thomaston grouped together with Brooks and his RTOs and FO to discuss the afternoon move . There would be three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the GreenMan was repeating his shrill order : " Get down there and hurt t hose little people . " " We ai nt walkin inta the middle a that valley in the middle of the fucken night , " Egan warned flatly . " No , " Brooks agreed . " We wo n't move down there yet . I think we should set up some ambushes up here . Move out and leave some ambush teams . Can we get some volunteers ? " " Give us ten , " Thomaston answered . He and Egan rose and circled the peak asking for ambush team volunteers . Cherry sat by the CP listening as the others prepared for the continuing move . He brushed a mosquito from his face and felt a small sore bump . He rubbed his fingers over his forehead and down by the side of his nose . " Oh God , " he muttered . " Pimples ! " Cherry checked and examined his body . His face had broken out and had several cuts , his arms were cut and bruised and the burns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His back and leg muscles were sore and his shoulders hurt from where the rucksack straps cut . Now he had a lull ruck again and the straps would cut deeper . He slipped a hand under his shirt and felt his shoulders . There too the skin was breakingout . Just like being thirteen again , he thought . He sat forward and felt the cloth of his pants tighten against his crotch . He was sore there also . His pants , the dirt and sweat , and the night mist were combining to irritate his inner thigh skin . Cherry got up , found Egan . " Hey , " he asked , " is the ambush team goina have to hump very far ? " " Negative , " Egan replied . " Are they goina need an RTO ? " Cherry asked . " That 's affirm , " Egan smiled . Oh to get rid of this dude for a day , he thought . " Could I volunteer ? " Cherry persisted expecting Egan to say no . " Right on , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egan grabbed Cherry and pulled him toward the LZ . " Come on , " he shouted . " I got somethin for ya . " The bird sat down , Egan ran forward , gave the doorgunner his letter and spoke to him for several seconds . Then he ran back to Cherry . The detail from 2d Plt loaded the material being sent back . " Scream , " Egan shouted into the noise of the rotorslap and engineroar . Cherry looked at him incredulously . " Yeah , SCREAM , " Egan yelled and he screamed as loud as he could . " AAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaa ... Tryit.  |p326Brooks  stood on one of the helicopter skids talking to the pilot , the last of the leftovers were being packed . " Try it , " Egan shouted into the noise of the helicopter and he screamed again jumping and shaking and laughing . Cherry attempted a yell , " AAaaaa ... " " Really yell , " Egan demanded laughing , tears coming to his eyes from facing into the gale rotor wash . " AAAEeeeik , " Cherry shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing and shaking . " AAAAAAAaaaeeeikk , " Cherry screamed and laughed out of control . Egan was holding his wrist and shaking it up and back . They were like two sport fanatics watching their team win in the last second . " AAAAAAAAaaaahh ... " They screamed together . Then the helicopterlifted and left and again they had to be silent . It was 1700 hours when Alpha finally began moving again , west again . The GreenMan 's pushing and shouting had reversed the slowdownof resupply . The call of the Khe Ta Laou accelerated their hump . Alpha moved out at a killer pace . They moved in column , 3d Pit , the CP , 2d and 1st . They moved quickly down the west side of 636 to a rivulet gorge between that peak and the peak of Hill 606 . Nahele walked point , Snell slack . Their disgust had changed to hatred . Nahele led the column along the gorge , cut above the rivulet , looking for a crossing . He refused to cross where Caldwell directed , nor would he cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other side , Cherokee was killed . Nahele led the column 100 meters parallel with the trickling water to just above a tiny waterfall . There , after sending security upstream , he crossed . The vegetation at the gorge crossing was thick and lush and dark . The canopy created an almost opaque roof and Nahele and Snell followed by the column slipped across in the darkness . Nine men remained at the crossing . They would return to 636 to ambush the LZ . Nahele worked the gorge cut back along the west side then turned due west and picked a steep climb toward 606 's peak . He moved slowly , jungle patrol cautious , yet steadily . He covered the one map kilometer , perhaps two surface klicks , in under an hour . Everyone behind the point was panting . The unit circled the peak , rested for five minutes then moved out again , again Nahele at point . Alpha continued its murderous march . They descended west off 606 into another steep-sided ravine , crossed another stream at the bottom and climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-minute break to allow the column to close up . At times the trail became so steep they had to crawl and dig inp327with their fingers and knees to ascend . They climbed to a position just below the next peak west , Hill 711 , broke for five , spread out on line and swept up and over the top . On top they rediscovered the NVA bunkers Charlie Company had found and destroyed on the 13th . Half the bunkers had been rebuilt . The enemy was nowhere to be seen . Alpha set up a full company perimeter in the enemy fightingcomplex . It was almost sunset . Brooks directed patrols , FO called DTs to the firebase , Doc checked and taped a turned ankle of a boonierat in 2d Pit . Men were directed urgently in every direction . A hasty CP meeting was called . Brooks , with the concurrence of all the platoon leaders and sergeants , directed 2d and 3d Pits to move out at gray dusk for an NDP 300 meters northeast , downhill . It would mark the beginning of Alpha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accompanied by the company CP , to follow 2d and 3d to the new NDP , then to leave their rucks and return east in lights . They would move back to Hill 606 and set up as a reaction force for the ambush team . They waited for the proper degree of grayness in the advancing dusk . It would be only a matter of minutes . From the summit of Hill 711 the soldiers could see west down the Khe Ta Laou and across the Da Krong and the narrow plain and into the foothills of Laos . The sun splashed a reverse pattern of the day 's first light , splashed and refracted against the base of accumulating high clouds . The sky glowed momentarily then became gray . The clouds above the Laotian hills grew thick and began to roll east . The boonierats watched the front approach , watched the sky seemingly fold in upon itself and upon them . Everything became still and quiet . " You decide what you 'll do yet , Ruf ? " Lt. Thomaston asked Lt. Brooks as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Brooks responded . He had almost called him Lila . Be here , he ordered his mind . " I 'd DEROS , " Thomaston said . " Of course , I ca n't make up your mind . But if you go , I get the company , I think . I think the GreenMan 'd give it to me . " " You do n't have much time left yourself , " Brooks said . " Twenty-five and a wake-up . He might give it to Wurzback but I think I 'd be acting CO at least . " " Let 's ruck up , " Brooks said standing . He helped Thomaston up then asked , " Do you really want it ? " " Ca n't look had on my record , " Thomaston said . " I 'll let you know within a day or two , " Brooks said.  |p328The  ambush team that had dropped off at the ravine between Hills 636 and 606 consisted of the 1st Sqd of the 1st Plt minus Steve Hoover , plus Cherry and Doc McCarthy . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank of the gorge above the crossing . Ambush had its benefits and its drawbacks . The volunteers did not have to hump . They sat , rested , relaxed . Two at a time they crawled to the stream to fill their canteens and wash . The drawbacks would begin after dark . " Gettin useta boonie life ? " Silvers whispered to Cherry when their turn in the stream came . " Mostly , " Cherry whispered back . Cherry was nervous and tight . The gorge crossing reminded him of the red ball from the water run . Cherry 's eyes examined the jungle west of the water and the stream above . He could feel the NVA soldier out there , feel his first KIA watching him . Silvers removed his clothes and sat in the water . He washed himself attempting to make as few motions as possible . He had brought a bar of soap and he lathered himself and rinsed part by part , foot to head , slowly . Cherry 's head snapped up frequently while he filled his canteens . His eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Silvers whispered flipping Cherry the bar of soap . " Ya owe it to yerself . " Silvers dressed quietly . He stood guard while Cherry undressed . Undressing made Cherry feel more aware of his body and more vulnerable . He was coated with dirt . Oh God , my pits stink , he thought . The water was cool and clear though it felt somehow grainy as if it had picked up and suspended immense quantities of clear sand . The coolness felt wonderful . Cherry squatted by the stream and washed quickly , cupping water upon himself with his hands , soaping then rinsing by cupping again . " Ya ought a get in , " Silvers whispered . " That 'll keep the jungle rot from gettin ya . " " This reminds me of a stream at Pomparaug , " Cherry said stepping into the stream timidly , straining to maintain control . He did not want to step too far from his rifle . " Where ? " Silvers whispered . " A Boy Scout camp I went to . " " Oh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cherry said . " I wish I could stop thinkin about dinks for just one fucken moment . " " Yeah , " Silvers whispered . They were standing very close to each other . " I know whatcha mean . " " Leon , " Cherry said very quietly . He stepped from the waterp329and dried himself with his filthy towel . " I 've been havin some terrible nightmares . " Silvers shrugged sympathetically . " I keep seem that guy , " Cherry said . Silvers dropped his head and did not speak . " I keep thinkin he 'll go away , " Cherry explained . " Then we get to a spot like this and I can feel him out there watchin me . " Silvers nodded his head in agreement . He was not sure how to respond . " It was either you or him , " he said finally . " Leon , I 'm goina see that guy every night for the rest of my life . " " It 'll go away , Man . " " Leon , " Cherry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gripped him , " he did n't just die . " Cherry shook like a naked frightened child . " He did n't just die , Leon . " " It do n't do any good to think about it , " Silvers said . Cherry 's emotional display unsettled him . " Man , the first rule out here is survive . That means kill em before they kill you . " " Leon , when he fell , " Cherry 's eyes were glazing over and he was inducing a trance as if he wanted to force the NVA soldier 's spirit to appear , " he . . . he was kickin . I wanted to go over and stop him but the AKs were firm . I was like a robot . I just fired at the noise and he kept kickin and twitchin . " " Come on , " Silvers said grasping Cherry hard by the arm . " Get dressed . Just say fuck it and drive on . Do n't mean nothin . Where 's my soap ? " Silvers ' jolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grabbed his rifle and Silvers ' soap . " Here , " he said returning the soap . " Thanks . " " Oh shit . Goddamn . " " What ? " " Look at this , Mothafucker . " " What ? " " There . On my soap . You fucken pig . Yer pubies . " Silvers held the bar of soap by his fingertips and wiped it against a rock scratchingoff a few curly black hairs . " Oh shee-it , " Cherry gurgled beneath his breath . " Mothafucker . You expect me to use that soap ! " The ravine became still and dark . Everyone had washed . The jungle about them seemed to be tightening down , closing in . The mbush team discussed their plan . Lairds and Denhardt said they should move out now . Silvers paused and told them to wait five Huse minutes . They all squirmed . " Call Quiet Rover , " Silvers directed Cherry . " Tell em we 're movin up . " They moved out . Silvers led with . I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brunak , Lairds , Denhardt , Nunihnuts , Cherry and Doe McCarthy at drag . Theyp330climbed straight but slowly , pausing often to insure they were not observed . The ambush team stopped their ascent 200 meters from the LZ on the summit of 636 . With each step up the canopy had thinned and it had become lighter . Silvers was apprehensive . Had he left the ravine too soon ? It had been very dark by the stream but it was now far too light to move into ambush position . The team sat in line on the trail , in complete silence . With only nine men they did not dare even cough . Without warning a wind gusted from the west . Just a single gust , then calm . It had come suddenly and it caused the vegetation to shudder . Good , Silvers thought . With a wind we 'll be able to move in undetected . The team 's plan was to slip in from below and set up behind the blown trees just off the LZ . This would give them clear fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come scavenging . It was common for soldiers of the rich American army to discard unwanted cans of food or even for some , like Numbnuts , to discard extra ammunition . The poorer NVA thrived on American LZs and old NDP sites . The better the American unit the less they left but Americans , unaccustomed to want , able to call in resupply helicopters , nearly always left something for NVA foragers . A second gust of wind shook the canopy . Keep it up , Silvers thought . He looked west into the wind . The gusts came in force now . The soldiers could see the clouds behind the wind , high towering clouds closing upon them from the west , enveloping the valley and the ridges . They could see the line of the approaching rain , the rain curtain reaching 711 , 606 , the ravine below them . Wind shook the jungle above them . The rushing seemed to vibrate the hill . Steadily the curtain advanced , harsh parallel streakingwater , not drops but lines crashing , resonating the foliage . Doc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One gigantic splat then total inundation swept across them all and the rain and ricochetingmist became as ambient as the subdued light . Numbnuts , Cherry and McCarthy at the team 's tail pulled their shirts tight in useless protection . Numbnuts unstrapped his helmet from his ruck and put it on his head . Cherry watched him and did the same . The noise of the rain on the helmets and in the canopy was very loud . " Rover Two Two , Quiet Rover Four , security check . Over . " El Paso radioed Cherry . Cherry scrunched down over the handset and listened as El Paso repeated the call . Then Cherry keyed the handset twice , indicating they were secure . With the rain came darkness . What luck , Silvers thought . He stood . He was totally soaked . The trail became a mudbrown stream . Man , what luck , he thought . When the boonierats were moving theyp331liked the rain because it was difficult to be heard . When they were set up they hated the rain for then it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Great , Silvers thought . He stirred Jackson . " Let 's go . " Jax grabbed Marko 's shoulder and gave a tug . Marko grabbed Brunak 's , Brunak Lairds ' , Lairds Denhardt 's , and Denhardt Numbnuts ' . There the signal broke . Numbnuts did not respond . The wind tore into him , opening his shirt even as he struggled to keep it shut . He did not want to move . He simply sat . The first six team members squirmed up toward the LZ in complete blackness , unaware of the last three sitting quietly . The squall further eroded Alpha 's morale . It had been a miserableday and now there was this tremendous torrent . From the first stinging splash it had saturated them to the skin . The platoons had humped off 711 in the initial onslaught . They had slid and slipped and fallen on the trail . The weight of their rucksacks toppled them . Their boot soles clogged with mud and their feet shot out from under them a dozen times each . 2d and 3d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 1st and the CP left their rucks and quickly descended then climbed back to Hill 606 . At their new NDP they huddled in pockets under the palms but the rain was so thick and the wind so fierce , they felt totally exposed . In the midst of the assembling CP group Brooks sat . Water puddled on his thighs . It ran from his face into his mouth . It trickled in streams beneath his shirt . The burden of command had become heavier . His company was too spread out for such a hostile AO and his troops were disgusted with the day 's events . Their fear was increasing , their confidence waning . The noise of the rain obliterated any possibility of hearing enemy movement . To add to the injustices their NDP site was so steep they could not lie down without rolling or sliding downhill . The guards found trees or shrubs to lie against or to straddle but gravity pushed them into the trees with all their weight and every few minutes they had to shift positions . It would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Thomaston and Egan and the meeting began . It lasted only a few minutes . Cahalan reviewed the day 's activities about the valley . Recon had killed one NVA in a brief encounter . Bravo had engaged an unknown-sized enemy force with unknown results . Egan bitched about the tunnel . " God mothafuckinwhore damn , " he cussed . " We 're practically still right there . Were jumpin back and forth , not goin anywhere , not doin anything where we 're at . " El Paso agreed and said that 's what killed Ridgefield . That dampened their spirits even more . " Where ma plasma ? " Doc questioned . " They was supposed to send out a hun'rcd bag . "  |p332No  one answered him . They all seemed to be in a stupor . Their eyes had sunk into deepening sockets . Since leaving the tunnel they had covered 3000 map meters , perhaps six kilometers climbing up and down , each carrying refilled rucks and equipment , all on full alert , in either tropical heat or in harsh cold rain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , loud enough to inject command energy into his weary soldiers , " tomorrow we get out of here . We cross the valley . El Paso , get De Barti and Caldwell on the hook . Cahalan get Red Rover . Any questions ? No ? Good . Tomorrow we get the ambush team back in at first light , then rendezvous with 2d and 3d . Then we cross the valley . " Cherry shuddered . The wind was harsher now . He had crossed and wrapped his arms about his chest . His rifle was muzzle up between his legs , his thighs pressed it as if for warmth . The jungle was pitch black . Cherry could not even see McCarthy who was sitting less than a meter from his feet . The trail had become a river and the water surged against Cherry 's ruck and his ass . The water streamed right through the material of his pants . Cherry 's teeth chattered . With this wind and rain , he thought , I could probably scream and not be heard . El Paso called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He rolled to his left , to his knees , and crawled forward a foot . Numbnuts was right there . " Hey , " Cherry hissed . " Hey , find out when we 're ... " Cherry reached out and grabbed the thumperman . " What ? " Numbnuts said , startled . " Cool it . Hey , when we goina move ? Were you sleepin ? " " I was n't sleepin , " Numbnuts snapped . " When we goina move out ? " Cherry asked . " McCarthy tapped Cherry from behind . " We movin ? I 'm fuckin freezin . When we ... " It took three or four minutes in the dark for them to determine they had broken contact , had become separated , were alone . " Hey , nobody signaled me , " Numbnuts defended himself . " You mothafucker , " McCarthy spit at Numbnuts ' face . " I ca n't believe you did that . " " I was n't sleepin , " Numbnuts snapped again . " Maybe you was sleepin . " The urge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seethed in Cherry too . Cherry forced his brain back into control . What should I do ? he thought . What 's got to be done ? He knew he could not call out , ' Hey , where are you guys ? ' though that was his first impulse . He hesitated to use the radio . He could call back to thep333CP but he could not call the ambush team . He had the team 's only radio . " Willis , " Cherry addressed Numbnuts using the thumperman 's surname to establish his own authority , " move up the trail about ten feet . See if you can find Denhardt . Doc , you watch below us . I 'm goina call Rover Two and get Egan . We got ta link back up with the team . " " I ai nt goin up there , " Numbnuts protested . " I ca n't see . " " Shut the fuck up , " Cherry whispered violently . A natural commandinstinct had surfaced in him . " When you speak , you speak quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Numbnuts whined irritably . " Why should I listen to you ? Huh ? It was n't my fault . . . Auughh ... " He screamed as Cherry jerked him up by his shirt then slammed him down into the mud . Cherry grasped him by the throat , held him with his left hand . Numbnuts squirmed . Cherry cocked his right arm , squeezed his fist , aimed at Numbnuts ' head .. . " What the fuck are you doin ? " Someone grabbed Cherry . " Where the fuck you been ? " It was Silvers . " Get up . Get up there . Get up there . What the fuck 's wrong with you ? " Silvers grabbed Cherry , spun him uphill and pushed him . Numbnuts jumped up about to protest but Silvers was already at the head of the little column . Numbnuts ran a few furious steps to catch up . Cherry was vibrating with rage at the injustice of Silvers ' accusing him . He stepped more lightly than he had ever stepped . Rain or no rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to take the rap for Numbnuts ' fuck-up . Cherry stepped where Silvers stepped except smoother , quieter . As they approached the summit LZ the slope leveled and they slowed . All of a sudden the howl and roar of the wind was engulfed in three successive explosions BOOM ! BOOM ! BOOM ! and a fusillade of firing . Cherry and Silvers dropped . The firing was 30 meters away . Silvers rose and crept quickly cautiously forward . Cherry , McCarthy and Numbnuts followed . Jax , Lairds and Denhardt were all firing t heir 16s and Marko the 60 as Brunak fed . They sprayed fire across t lie entire LZ . " Over there , " Denhardt yelled . " Out there , " he screamed . Silvers reached him . " There 's gooks over there . I seen em . " He continued tiring . Silvers tossed a grenade and fired . Cherry squeezed off a burst on full automatic . Then everything became quiet . There had been no return fire . They paused . The team huddled together to discuss what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard and making noise in the : inopv . The NVA could he maneuvering up to their sides , aroundp334behind them , maybe even in front of them . " We blew it , Man , " Marko said . " We got ta go back . " " Call the CP , " Jax said . " Tell em we done blowed our position . Ef anybody out here , they know right where we at . " They all agreed . No one , including Silvers , wanted to remain . They had fired too much at too little . Silvers grabbed the hook . " Quiet Rover Four , this is Rover Two Two . Over . " Silvers called . At the CP El Paso answered and passed the hook to the L-T . " We 're comin back in , " Silvers informed Brooks . Brooks asked questions . He listened . He thought it would be more dangerous for the team to move than to stay and rearrange themselves . Silvers argued for returning . Brooks denied his request again . Their conversation ended there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And without permission the ambush team backed out of its position behind the blown trees , returned to the trail and descended toward the ravine . Very quietly they descended in column , all of them very alert now , holding the rucksacks to their front in an unbroken chain . Egan and Thomaston had crawled away from the CP meeting and had dragged themselves through the mud to a guard/sleeping position at the side of a foot-thick tree . It could not have been more uncomfortable . Because of the slope , they slid into each other , pressed each other against the tree . On top of all else , where the tree 's roots spread , rising from the ground like an inverted fan , the tiny cavities and recesses were filled with spider webs . Egan felt wretched . Finally he got up , moved up the hill several meters , found a thin tree trunk and tied himself to it . He settled back wrapped in a poncho liner and poncho and closed his eyes . Stephanie came to him immediately . Like magic she eased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rain ceased , the wind became a gentle breeze . After that October afternoon in New York Daniel Egan lost contact with Stephanie . He called a few times without receiving an answer and finally found the phone disconnected . It must have been at least a month between calls and in those months he found a new Daniel , a man sexually attractive to women . All this time , he thought , I thought you had to be something special to get a girl . I thought they had to love you . In the course of a semester Daniel moved from naive small town boy to campus stud . He kept score , laughing about it with his football friends , and flaunting his prowess at fraternity parties . He fell in love a dozen times and forgot a dozen names . And he found he hated it . Something was missing . On a cold snowy night in February Daniel was in bed withp335Little Fannie , a fraternity sweetheart . They had just made love or at least balled . He had just come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semi-flaccid . For this , he had said to himself , for this I did n't pull it for two days . He lay there thinking . Then he rolled off . " Fannie , " he said . " Ah , I got a big exam tomorrow . I got to study . " She said go ahead and pulled the blanket tightly about herself . " Ya ca n't stay while I 'm studying , " he said . " You got to be kidding , " she had said . In the end he threw her out . After she left he lay alone for a long time . Then he rose , went to his desk and wrote a note to Stephanie . Now in the vacuum of darkness , on that empty fetid hillside morass where he had tied himself , her image warming his enslaved soul solidified and she spoke the soliloquy of her reply , a reply which did not arrive until early June . Dear Daniel , I 'll bet you 're wondering what 's happened to me . Things have happened quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain as best I can . The last time we talked I told you I did n't know where I was going . I had to leave NYC , so , I went home . I 'm skipping around . I 've been having trouble with my step-father because he thinks what I did was a terrible sin . I 'll get to that . One night , shortly after I moved back in , he and mother were arguing about my being here and I overheard and went downstairs to tell him to leave mother alone and that I would leave . Before I knew it I was telling him how he had never shown me any love . The idea that he had failed as a father and that therefore had contributed to my sin surprised him . He 's always been such a success at everything . Anyway , I 'm married , getting divorced , and I 've had an abor-t ion . Actually , you 're not going to believe this , but I had two . I 've been through quite a lot since I last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know if you know anything about them . They certainly are not fun . I became very ill after my second D &; C which is a scraping of the uterus . I only got out of the hospital yesterday . When I get up and around I 'm planning to get a job and save some money so I can go to school . I want to work with children . I have definitely decided not to go into artAs far as the divorce is concerned that will be happening very soon . Not a definite date now but soon . As soon as possible . I hesitate to write you , Daniel , because I 've been so sick and because I realIv do n't know if ' it is the right thing to do . Ip336respect you so much and I do n't want you to get involved in anything ugly . This is really hard for me to put into words but it is how I feel . I was n't going to write then I started thinking about how much I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just how much to get involved . I do n't understand exactly how I feel . The whole time I was living with my husband I could n't stand it and I thought of you constantly . I wanted to call you so badly . Daniel , please write . Write me a long letter . You 're such a wonderful writer , so precise and beautiful with words . Please do n't be afraid of my feelings . I 'll never press you . Could you send me a sketch too ? I know someday you 'll be a superb architect . It 's very late but I do n't want this letter to end . It 's almost like I 'm talking to you . I guess I should get to bed . Love , StephanieTwo Fridays after the letter arrived , Daniel left school . He hitchhikedto her , arrived on her doorstep at three Saturday morning and allowed the long sleepless night to torture him in an attempt to atone for his lapse . " I brought you something , " he smiled when she opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screamed with glee . She rushed to him and they embraced and held each other tightly and then her mother was there saying hello and making them breakfast . Saturday was beautiful . She took him to a lake and they hiked to the secluded far shore . Stephanie had never been lovelier . The air remained crisp all day , the sunshine warm and clean . " Daniel , " she said . God , he thought , how much I love to hear you say my name . " Why are you so quiet ? Talk to me . I 've told you all about my past eight months and you 've told me nothing . " He wanted to speak but he could n't . How could he confess to her that he had been on a fuckathon . He looked into those beautiful eyes and he thought of himself and he felt like dirt . " I love your sketch , " Stephanie said . She kissed him then raised her sweater and exposed her breasts and gently pulled Daniel 's face to her . Egan lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his side and pushed the poncho liner up higher about his neck . He felt pleasantly warm . The image before him shifted . There were two lovers alone and in darkness . He recognized himself . " I 've designed some of the worlds most wonderful homes in my head , " his image said.  |p337She  laughed . " I 've painted some of the greatest pictures in my mind . " They both laughed . Then they stopped and were silent and they shared a sorrow . What if I never really design them ? he shuddered . What if they are not the most wonderful when they are on paper ? She too shuddered , then breaking their silence Stephanie said , " Please . Let 's go someplace . " " Yes , " Daniel said . " Let 's go . " " Where ? " " Nowhere . Let 's just go . " They rose and stood for a dizzy moment and looked at each other . Stephanie sat back down . " Get up , " Daniel pleaded gently . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Stephanie cried . " You 're going to go back to school or to a job . Leaving me again . " In the cold jungle the memory now agitated Egan . Perhaps he had been too close to it then . Perhaps he could understand it better now , from this distance in time and space . Much of what Daniel Egan remembered of Stephanie was not her at all but was only him when he was with her . Perhaps I was n't sensitive enough to perceive more than just me , he thought . I never asked her how she felt or what she thought . I did n't really know her . She is not really here at all , he thought . The wind blew colder . He wanted to know her so much more . His dream convoluted . The warmth vanished . The fragrance became the odor of jungle rot and dead men . The sky 's glow dimmed , became dark and ugly . A harsh glint chased Stephanie 's image from Nile screen of his mind . Egan was petrified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to react . The sapper squatted by his side . The silver machete was in his right hand . Egan tried to move . The rope rest Faints cut into his wrists , his ankles . He arched his back , lifted his belly . Moonlight sparkled upon the blade and in the sapper's4 , eves as the dark foe raised the knife . The enemy cocked his wrist , aimed the blade for Egan 's eyes , began the downward killing stroke . Egan craned his neck to avoid the slashing blade . The blade touchedEgan bolted upright panting , paranoid . Rain streamed down his lace . He grabbed his forehead , his nose , his cheeks . He tasted the trcant to insure it was not blood . SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIESTHE . FOLLOWING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE O'REILLY/ BARNI .

He had changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REMF soldier and then to cherry soldier . They were changes which happened to him , not changes of him , changes which occurred because the army had moved him . Those changes were not great . On 17 August he changed greatly , he changed to just plain soldier . " We 're startin back , " Cherry radioed Quiet Rover . It was not yet first light . " We 're on our way back , " he lied . " Ah , roger that Two Two , " El Paso replied . At the CP El Paso was on radio watch again . He rolled and woke Brooks . " Ambush team comin back in . " " Uhl What time is it ? " " Oh five-four-eight , " El Paso said . First light was approaching . Cahalan stirred beside El Paso . Above them Doc was going through his aid bag . The sky 's blackness softened . It was still raining . Brooks got up and relieved himself against a tree below their position . " We 're at the blue feature , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first call . All the soldiers at the CP were up , folding ponchos , cleaning weapons , brushing teeth . The guards were up too . They had humped to the NDP in lights which meant they had not brought food . Some of them bitched about being hungry . Doc Johnson passed amongst them handing each man a Monday Pill , a large orange quinine anti-malaria tablet . Everyone swallowed one . The Monday Pill was very seldom discarded . It wasp342a big bright orange pill , it looked important , and it marked the passing of another week . That gave it ritual significance . At 0625 Cherry radioed the CP again to give his position and determine theirs . They were very close . In fact they were less than fifty meters from 1st Pit . After the ambush squad had blown its cover by engaging suspectedenemy movement on the LZ , they had backed off Hill 636 and , in the dark , had wormed back down to the ravine . " Fuck the L-T , " Silvers had said . " We ai nt stayin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed . At the ravine they crossed the stream , discussed setting up but decided to move up . Silvers had followed the trail down but he had not known where to go up . He had simply set a compass course and stumbled in one general direction mumbling to himself the entire time , " God do n't let the gooks be here . God do n't let the gooks be here . " Quite by accident they had found a small indentation in the hill , which was partially protected from the elements and in the dark appeared very defensible . They had devised a guard/radio watch schedule  --  two awake , seven asleep  --  and , exhausted from the day 's work , had slept . Every two hours the guards changed . Every hour the CP called for a situation report . For Cherry , for all of 1st Sqd except Silvers who bore the responsibility of their move , it had been the best night of sleep since stand-down . The ambush team stood up and marched in silently . Whiteboy , Egan and Thomaston greeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Egan asked . " Gooks , " Lairds laughed . " Let 's go over it , " Thomaston said . He pumped them with questions , received vague answers about movement and asked them if they would like to return for a first light check , " Which you shoulda done before you left . " " Augh , Man , " Silvers groaned , " we just humped back . " " I 'll go , " Egan volunteered . " Who wants to tricky-trot up there with me ? " In lights the recon element , Egan , Whiteboy , Moneski and his gun team and Hoover with the radio , moved very quickly . They were to the LZ and back in forty minutes . " Hey , " Egan laughed when they returned . " Hey Silvers . Here 's your gook . Here 's the gook you got last night . " On the end of his rifle Egan had an American fatigue shirt that had been blown to hell . Half the platoon clustered close to see . They were all laughing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count . " Whiteboy threw the shirt up into a tree . " It was just a dang-a-lin lahk that , " he laughed.  | " Ah , that do n't prove nothin , " Numbnuts protested . Everyone laughed at him . Egan grabbed the shirt and tossed it at Silvers playfully . " Here 's your gook , Leon . " They were uncharacteristically loud . Cherry laughed along with them all , not saying a word. 1st Plt and the company CP retraced their steps across the ridge , into the ravine and up , and rendezvoused with 2d and 3d Pits . The unit 's field force now stood at eighty-three , down from ninety on the morning of 16 August if the PIOs and correspondent and the dog team and Ridgefield were included : eighty-three men with the mission of descending into the Khe Ta Laou to assault the suspected Headquarters of the 7th NVA Front , eighty-three soldiers assigned to search out and destroy a suspected , long occupied , extensively developed and heavily defended supply base and staging area . The company moved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by the CP and then 3d. 1st Plt hung back as rear security . The column moved quickly at first ; then , as the point element hit thicker and thicker vegetation , the column barely edged forward . The terrain became steeper . Standing was exhausting . Rucks dug deeply into shoulders . The straps pulled at shoulder skin made resistant by the continuing rain . The skin distorted from the pressureand felt as if it were ripping . Arms became weary from holding weapons , from grasping small trees for handholds to keep from sliding , from pushing and lifting bodies and rucks back up after they lead fallen . The point pulled his machete and selectively sliced a trail . Behind point one hundred and sixty-six boots mulched the cuttings into the mud and sections of the trail became slides . Alpha came to a series of cliffs . 1st Plt sent forward the ropes Egan had used at the tunnel . The point rigged them for rappeling and the column descended . From the top of the first cliff Cherry glared down at the valley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the boonierats , had been looking at it for four days , glimpsing it through breaks in the vegeIUtion , through a waxing and waning fog shroud . Cherry glared dove n upon it . Beneath the fog there would be a different world . Uver he went , rappeled . The column continued to descend . The morning was quiet except Ian the rain and the noise of men slipping and falling , and the but sting of artillery far to the northeast . By noon the point element ul the column reached the first rolling hills , mounds , between the Nerp slope of the linger and the valley floor . The boonierats set up a drlensive perimeter and rested . The 1st Sqd of the 1st Plt , thep344farthest extreme of the column , was only halfway down the finger , still in the cliffs . For them the trail had become so mushed by the preceding troops , they had to crawl backward and dig their fingers into the thick slop to keep from tumbling off the trail and into the jungle below . The column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the troops at the rear completed the steep descent . Alpha was half-in , half-above the valley fog , a thick sticky-feeling mist through which the rain continued to fall but through which no one could see . The vegetation about them was as different from the trees and vines of the ridge as it would have been if they had crossed space to another planet . It was gray scraggle brush , low , only five to ten feet high , and it was so incredibly dense , except on paths , it was impossible to even shove an arm deeply into it . With the mist it made the boonierats uneasy and frightened . It was another world , the NVA 's world . Hand signals passed unnecessarily : maintain strict noise discipline , keep movement to a ininimum . Egan moved a thumb toward his open mouth signaling to Cherry , eat . Cherry passed the signal to Doc McCarthy behind him and slipped from his ruck . Along with all his other aches and stiffness , Cherry found the skin of his thighs was raw . Shit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got a case of the black syph . Oh shit . Maybe I got it from movin them barrels of shit down at Cam Ranh . Cherry glanced about him then unbuttoned his pant fly . He looked at his legs . Patches of skin on his inner thighs from his testicles down about four inches were brightly inflamed . The rainwater dripping from his hands onto the chafed skin burned . " Oh God , " Cherry moaned . He did not want to tell anyone because he was embarrassed by the location of the sores and also because he feared it might be something serious . He had heard stories about strains of venereal disease immune to penicillin and all other modern drugs . There were rumors of an American colony on Guam of infected men from Vietnam that the government would not allow to return to the States . He looked at the rash again . It was on his balls too . Oh shit . Oh shit , oh shit . Cherry tried to recall from his biology classes what the incubation period for syphilis was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets worse , he thought . He thought about how it had progressed , spoke it to himself as if he were telling a medic . " Doc , " he said to himself , " it 's really gettin bad . I do n't know where I could a got it . I ai nt even sure what it is but I can hardly walk with it . " Lt. Brooks had been working his way around Alpha 's perimeter . He very quietly asked questions and advice . When he reached Egan he squatted . Egan was sitting in a puddle . He appeared comfortable.  |p345Me  L-T and Egan tapped fists . " If you were a little people , " Brooks asked , " where would you be ? " " If I knew somebody was comin after me ? " Egan asked . " Yeah , " Brooks said . " Are you rulin out the tunnels in the hills ? " " Yep . Down here . Where ? " " I 'd be leavin a trail so you 'd follow me to my battleground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Where would you put your headquarters ? " " Away from the trail I 'd want you to follow . " Brooks pulled out his topo map . " Show me . " Egan looked at the map . He studied it . " Not in the foothills , we might come down on them . Not on the flat , too easy for the birds to time em up . Ah , unless they got some Russian tanks in here , ya know , L-T .. . " What ? " " ... I 'd be at the high feature on the river . There 's the ridge cumin out toward it from both sides . Not a lot of room for fast movers to work . " " Thanks . " " Right on . " Brooks moved back to Cherry , asked him how he was holding tip , and moved on as Cherry nodded okay . Cherry waited until the commander had passed Doc McCarthy then he crept back to the medic . Egan turned and watched . Fuck Egan , Cherry thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somethin ? " " Yeah . What is it ? " " I got this , ah , problem . " " What is it ? " McCarthy asked . He looked at Cherry very sympatheticallyand asked him , " Where is it ? " Thanks , Cherry thought . This guy 's got a talent for making it . " It 's my groin . I think I got the syph . " " You got burnin ? " " Yeah . " " Really bad , I mean . " " I can hardly walk , " Cherry said . " Walk ? I mean when you piss . " " Nu Due . When I walk . " " Lei me sec " Doc said . Cherry unbuttoned his pants . Goddamn Egan , watchin , Cherry night . Cherry dropped his fatigue trousers and pulled up the side of his OD boxer trunks exposing the chafed hot skin . " Ouuoo ! You got it had " McCarthy said . " You should n't a let itp346get that bad . " Egan had come back to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What is it ? " Cherry said turning away from Egan . Egan pulled his bayonet from the sheath at his calf and smiled sadistically . " Ah ha , got ta cut it off . " Cherry 's eyes widened . He began pulling his pants up . " Well what the fuck is it ? " he demanded . In one quick motion Egan slipped the blade of his bayonet into Cherry 's boxer trunks and cut the cloth up the side . " Crotch rot , " McCarthy said . " Jungle rot of the crotch . " Egan kept Cherry off-balance tugging at the waistband of his underwear as he slipped the bayonet blade into the other side and cut the material . Then he whipped the tattered cloth away and flicked it into the jungle brush . " You ca n't wear underwear here , " Egan chuckled . " It 'll rot yer balls off . " " Here , " McCarthy said handing Cherry a tube of salve . " Rub some of this on it . " Suddenly from behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling his pants up . Egan charged toward the firing . Grenades exploded . Snell , Nahele and McQueen from 3d Plt came racing through , running to the fight . The initial firing lasted less than ten seconds . Jackson , Marko , Brunak , Lairds and Denhardt had fired simultaneously down the slope of the mound . They were at the very rear of the column . They had descended the cliffs last , had crossed the small draw to the mound and had been sitting quietly when they heard the chatter . They all turned slowly and looked through the tangle of dense brush and they saw an NVA squad . The enemy soldiers were walking casually , talking , their rifles slung over their shoulders . The initial blast felled four . Egan , Brooks , Silvers , Nahele , a whole group of them lay on the ground , whispered back and forth . " Silvers , take six men down there , " Brooks directed pointing to the right . " Danny , Don , Queenie , " Brooks pointed to the left . Brooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the spot where 1st Sqd had been when they fired , Moneski 's squad covered the advancing recon and all around the perimeter men shifted to fill gaps . " Holy fucken Christ ! " Egan uttered . In the hollow below the mound there was a red ball but it was unlike any red ball Egan had ever seen . The trail was five feet wide with an all-weather surface . The ground had been leveled and reinforced with bamboo . The canopy above had been woven into living semi-solid mats . Egan 's group followed the trail only half-a-dozen meters then stopped . In the opposite direction Silvers ' squad followed the trail a few meters to where it turned to the hill . Here a culvert allowed a stream top347pass beneath the trail without washing it out . Where Brooks descended his group found blood puddles , blood trails , a small rucksack and nothing more . There were no bodies . The boonierats retreated back to the mound . " There 's got ta been at least a dozen , " Thomaston said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " At least , " Marko whispered and Silvers and Jax agreed . " They had to have at least a dozen to carry those bodies out a there that quick , " Thomaston said . " I do n't think if there were only seven or eight they could a done that . " " Look at this shit , " Egan whistled . He was pilfering the NVA ruck . Along with a bag of rice and a bowl there was black licorice candy , a C-ration B-2 Unit , US matches and various odds and ends Alpha had left at their resupply site . " So , " Silvers said punching Egan 's shoulder and chuckling , " there 's my gook . " Alpha moved out again almost immediately . They remained in the same order , 2d Plt , CP , 3d and 1st . Their fight was not for the road , and they had no intention of following it to a certain ambush . They called the action in to the TOC and found that Bravo Company was again engaged in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had returned toward their original insertion LZ . At the same location where they had been assaulted on the night of the 14th , they cornered a well entrenched NVA company . Artillery was attempting to soften their objective . The rain and fog prohibited Tac Air or helicopter support . Alpha monitored the fight . Recon too was in a skirmish . The column humped north and slightly west moving from mound to mound of ever decreasing size , descending to the flat valley floor . Alpha humped steadily , cautiously . They crossed another red ball and this one too had an all-weather surface . At a pause Brooks studied his topo map . None of the trails were indicated . Alpha continued toward the river , aiming northwest now , downstream . The mist thickened . The vegetation changed again as they descended , the dense scragglebrush giving way to dense bamboo and elephantgrass . In places the bamboo was over fifteen feet high . The point man felt as if he were breaking trail through knife blades of spring steel . His arms were soon slashed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass cut fine and quick and a hoonierat did not know until after he was cut that a blade had touched him . The blood trickled and microscopic barbs stung in the woundds . The point alternated with his slack and finally every man In the lead squad had experienced the agony of breaking trail.  |p348The  valley floor was even more eerie than the mounds . The rain continued . It was nearly impossible for Alpha to establish their precise position . Surrounded by fog and high grass they could not sight landmarks . The flat valley floor revealed no clues . They knew the location of the first mound below the cliffs and their own approximatedirection . The distance they moved was vague . When Brooks believed , guessed , his point element was 100 meters from the river , he called a halt . The column sat . " El Paso , call De Barti , " Brooks directed . " Tell him to move his gunteams to point . Call Snell and get Nahele and McQueen up here . Have Thomaston send up Whiteboy . " When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they and the entire CP moved forward . They walked quietly up the trail stepping over and around seated men . At 2d Plt 's command post Brooks and De Barti planned Alpha 's sweep to the river . Leon Silvers was at the rear of the column . To his front was Brunak , then Marko and Jax and the rest of 1st Sqd ending with Numbnuts. 1st Plt 's CP had dropped back to between 1st and 2d Sqds . The boonierats were sitting at six to eight foot intervals . Thomaston , facing Egan , held up two fingers on his right hand and four on his left . He smiled and mouthed , " Twenty-four and a wakeup . " Twenty-one , you cherry , " Egan smiled back . The column began to move again then it stopped . It moved a little then stopped again . Cherry came up behind Egan and whispered , " They 're at the river . " Egan nodded , moved up several feet and sat down . Cherry sat where he had been standing . One by one the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A cool breeze swayed the tall grass . Cherry examined his fingers . The skin was puffed and white and wrinkled from the long exposure to the wet . He began to meditate , to ponder the loneliness he was experiencing . For extended hours they all humped without speaking . For hours he marched seeing only the one man before him and at times not even seeing him . Cherry longed for a CP meeting . He looked to his rear . McCarthy was lying back on his ruck . From behind the medic , Numbnuts ' whisper seeped into the quiet . That guy wo n't ever learn , Cherry said to himself . An uneasy feeling came upon Cherry . He looked left then right . Somebody was watching . He looked over his shoulder again at McCarthy . The mist was so thick it blurred his image . Cherry could feel eyes on the back of his neck . He glanced around anxiously . He could see nothing but dense walls of elephant grass . Maybe it 's better not to look , he thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt as if something was about to reach outp349and grab him . " Fuck it , " he whispered . The breeze swayed the top of the grass again . He fidgeted apprehensively . Trail watchers ? Timidlyhe turned left gaping into the grass . Slowly he looked right . His hand played with the trigger mechanism of his weapon . He shortenedhis neck . His helmet touched his ruck . He waited for the spell to break , for the column to move . Maybe I ought a tell McCarthy , he thought . He hesitated . It 's too unfounded . I have n't seen anything . lie tried to relax but still he could feel eyes focusing on the back of his neck . Again he turned . He was very low on the ground . The eyes were still behind him . His arms trembled , his fists clenched , his mind lost awareness . He stared vacantly at his fatigue pants  --  wet and filthy . His boots were coated with slime and splinters of grass . Cherry shut his eyes , shrunk lower for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swirled in strange geometric kaleidoscope clouds . Forms precipitated . At the base he could see ankles congealing , his ankles , his knees . He was suspended in blackness with only his legs illuminated by the geometric green glow . Slowly the kaleidoscope turned . The vision focused . Baggy green fatigue pant legs unclouded . The image cleared upward to his waist . He was not sure if his eyes were open or shut . He could see his shirt , his shoulders . Every minute segment , every stitch , was in perfect focus . Cherry could see his neck . Then the head appeared . It was large . Too large . Then the face . It was not Cherry 's face . It was the face of the enemy soldier . It stared at Cherry . It had Cherry 's body . The face contorted . Cherry 's body took one cautious step forward , stepped right through Cherry Sving on the trail . Behind him eyes bore down on his back , burned hate into his neck . It was not a man . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cherry 's heart pounded . His eyes crushed tight . The falcon hovered unseen behind him  --  invisible and waiting , waiting to strike , waiting to split the air with lightning speed , to swoop down invisible  --  The Talons of God ! The man stood between Cherry and God . He glared into Cherry'seyes from atop Cherry 's own body . We got to move . I ca n't sit here . Cherry was frozen . Thoughts flashed through his head but they could not penetrate the image before his eyes . Do n't let the talons get me , he prayed . Cherry cowered lower into the foul muck . Oh God . Oh God . I 'm sorry . I had to do it . Titanic wings beat creating wind in the valley , gusts bending the wretched grass . God , you could have turned him around . He was coming at me . Tears welled to Cherry 's eyes . The valley blackened and for protracted seconds Cherry 's heart ceased to beat . The soldier took shape again , smiling laughing behind thick vegetation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head , the soldier 's taunting face above the sight of Cherry 's ownp350weapon . The face became Cherry 's face . Cherry squeezed his weapon , he tried not to squeeze , he squeezed , the muzzle flashed , the rifle kicked , the face erupted , the forehead burst red , exploding . The body dropped into the darkness twitching in violent spasms . Crimsongore dissolved to chalky-pale hollow , then to sallow complexed bone , an emaciated skull . The skull 's eyes glared green , glared into Cherry 's soul . Cherry 's body twitched . He opened his eyes . He looked around . He stood . He clenched his teeth . " Fuck it , " he cussed bitterly . " Do n't mean nothin . " Cherry moved up to Egan . " Let 's get this God fucken show on the road . " Brooks orchestrated the river crossing . He sent 2d Plt 's 3d Sqd upriver thirty meters and directed them to stay ten meters away from the riverbank. 2d Sqd he sent downriver. 1st Sqd he held to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra gunteams . " Do n't approach the water , " he emphasized to every squad , every rifle team . The squads worked to their positions then sat and watched and waited . Brooks made them sit and observe for a full fifteen minutes . " Move up , " El Paso radioed on Brooks ' command . All elements moved to within viewing distance of the water and sat again , still concealed by valley floor vegetation . Again , for fifteen minutes they observed . They watched the river , the near bank and the far . Fog hung about them , over them , in the grass . But it did not lie on the water 's surface . The water was dark and appeared still , almost stagnant . Rain textured the surface with thousands of minute expandingringwaves . On both sides the riverbank rose as vertical black muck rims topped with cowlicks of green grass . Elephant grass and bamboo encroached to the water 's edge and variously overhung the river where the bank was collapsing . At the point where Alpha intersected the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The security squads up and down river set up half-arc perimeterswith the machine guns facing the river and the back of the arcsopen to the column . The machine gunners opened and extended thebi-pod legs of the 60s and laid their ammo out in preparation for afight . Behind them thumpermen mock registered their grenadelaunchers . Riflemen opened tiny holes in the grass to aim through . " Let 's go , " Brooks motioned . 1st Sqd and the company CP andall of 2d Plt moved to the river 's edge . The column moved up behind them . Old Pop Randalph climbed down and into the deceptivecurrent . Even at the very edge it caused him to stagger as the blackwater suddenly gurgled and surged against his legs . Pop retreated ,  |p351sli|p|ped  out of his ruck , removed his boonie hat and web gear and laid his weapon down . Again he waded into the water , cautious , aware that there might be enemy gunners on the far side . The water was running very fast . Four paces out the bottom dropped and Pop was over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 meters below where he had slipped by the time he could stand . He returned to point . He consulted with the L-T and with De Barti and with Camillo Baiez . Pop removed his boots and his shirt and climbed back into the water . He took two steps out , dove in and began stroking with all his strength , kicking and splashing like a miniaturepaddlewheel riverboat . The current grabbed him and swept him downstream at twice the speed he was swimming across . He was swept past the downstream security team before he was halfway . Mohnsen , Jones , Smith and Garbageman set out after him , noisily , nervously trampling the vegetation as they raced along thehank . When he finally hit the far side Pop was seventy-five meters below point . He stayed low , pulled himself out of the water , signaledthumbs-up okay to the troops chasing him , and disappeared into the grass beyond the far bank . Five minutes later he reappeared directly across from Brooks . " Goddamn , " De Barti sighed . " That of drunk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly pissin . " " This is fucked , Mista , " Doc Johnson skid toward both lieutenants . FO stood beside Doc . He nodded his head in agreement . He was not impressed . Brooks glanced at them then turned back to the river . Baiez had a coil of light nylon cord to which he had attached a weight . He looked across at Pop , hunched over , ground his feet into the mud , went into his wind-up and let his pitch fly . The coil backlashed and flew after the weight in a clump snapping stopped out ten meters and kerplunking into the river . Baiez reeled it in and tried again . Then again and again . " Bravo got three casualties , " Brown interrupted Brooks with a report of action up the valley . " They 're really in it deep . They 're gettin inta that complex . " Brooks snarled angry and disgusted . Here Bravo was being chewed to pieces and he could not even get Alpha across a goddamnedwater obstacle . Brooks grabbed Baiez . " Give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cord and weight from the squad leader 's hands . He recoiled the line loosely on the ground then threw the weight across the river . Pop retrieved it . On the company 's side they attached the heavier ope they had used in the tunnel and at the cliffs . Pop pulled the line across , anchored it to himself and signaled for the troops top352come . One at a time , in full gear , the men waded in , treaded as best as possible , hung on to the rope , pulled hand-over-hand to the far side . " Fucked , Man , fucked , " Doc shook his head . The weight of their equipment forced each soldier under . After six had crossed , after Shaw had nearly drowned when he lost the rope , several boonierats stripped and recrossed and acted as lifeguards and guides . On the north side each man opened his weapon to drain the barrel of water , then disappeared into the grass enlarging the ever increasingperimeter. 3d Plt crossed after one squad of 2d . Then the CP crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They reorganizedthemselves , emptied and squeezed water from their gear . It had all been soaked by the rain and most of it was not much wetter . But almost everyone 's cigarettes had been saturated . This was a crisis . Cigarettes were carried in two-piece plastic boxes ; boxes that kept out rain but they were not waterproof . Alpha moved out in disgust . Ten minutes later they were forced into another delay . The valley north of the river was infested with a moist-land leech which seemed to thrive everywhere except in runningwater . The boonierats had unsuspectingly been assaulted by the leeches as soon as they had crossed . The leeches crawled like inchworms and attached themselves , boring painlessly into wet boonierat skin . Unless seen , a leech could suck its head a quarter inch deep before the area began to burn . After the tenth complaint , Doc Johnson ordered Brooks to halt the company . " Have em pair off , " Doc said . " Have the fuckas check each other out . " Oh Christ , Brooks thought . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did not want to sit in the valley unnecessarily . He was embarrassed by the sloppiness of the river crossing . Several of the troops had lost gear in the river and the whole thing , though it began perfectly , lacked discipline . This was n't his Alpha . He was sick . He checked El Paso 's back and found a leech near the RTO 's armpit . It was already late afternoon . Brooks wanted to get up to a high feature to NDP . " Goddamn leeches , " he whispered to El Paso as he snapped the tiny slimy body then dug in with his fingernailsfor the head . Get a hold of yourself , Rufus , he told himself . You ca n't lose it now . Fuck that bitch . You can pull this back together . " Augh no , " he sighed . He reached down into his pants . He could feel the cool clammy body of a sucker on his abdomen just above his groin . He opened his pants . The leech squirmed behind its sucking head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the box . Brown tobacco juice water sloshed over his fingers . It was still raining when the column reached the abrupt face of the north escarpment . They had come 400 meters from the riverp353through elephant grass and bamboo without feeling any apparent elevation change and then they hit the road and the mountain cliff . " Oh my Holy Mother , " Garbageman gasped seeing the road . 2d Pit had led off again after everyone had tightened and tied off clothing against the leech invasion . The point squad had changed from Catt 's to Mohnsen 's . Garbageman was at point , Smith , with his 60 , at slack . Where they hit the road at the base of the mountain there was a ten foot wide all-weather road , not only reinforced with bamboo but solidified with gravel . It was adjacent to the cliff and ran as far as Garbageman could see in the fog in both directions . Elephant grass formed a cleanly trimmed wall along the valley side of the road , the cliff had been evenly cleaved on the other shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living nets to form a natural-looking roof . From the air the roof would appear to be unbroken jungle valley floor and it would conceal all road traffic . To Garbageman standing in the vegetation ogling the road , it wasevident that NVA honchos had established the road here because ofthe difficulty helicopters would have molesting troop or munitions traffic . Garbageman had never seen an enemy road so wide , wide enough for two-way cart traffic , wide enough for trucks . It made the ied balls look like animal trails . The surface was rutted with recent signs of activity yet showed signs of continuous care and maintenance . Smitty up , Garbageman signaled . Smith came forward . " Go hack and get De Barti and Pop , " Garbageman whispered . " They got ta check this the fuck out , Man . " Word passed back . Pop Randalph came forward , then Lt. De Barti . " L-T gon na have to see this , " they agreed and they radioed the CP . The boonierats of the lead squad thined out in the grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brooks , his three RTOs and FO worked their way to point . From the depths of the grass they all examined the road . " What do you think , Ruf ? " De Barti asked the L-T very quietly . They were separated from the others by six or seven feet . De Barti did not want to expose his deep apprehension to the troops . " I do n't think we ought a use it . " Brooks pulled out his topo map without answering and the two lieutenants studied it . " If we can find a way up the cliff ... " Brooks began . " No way we 're goin up that shit , " De Barti said . " It 's vertical . " " It ca n't be vertical for very far , " Brooks said . The two musedover the map and peered out of the grass at the road . They could seeonly a small strip . Brooks removed his hat and scratched his scalp . Go back through the leeches and recross the river , go up the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All about him the boonieratsp354were becoming more and more restless . It was getting near dusk . With a road like this , he thought , the NVA could have thousands of troops in here . Brooks went to Cahalan . " Get me Red Rover , " he said . " Bill , " he turned to FO , " have you ever come across a road like this ? " " No , L-T , ca n't say I have . " " Can you get arty on it ? " " Yes Sir . Can do . " " Good . Call in targets all along this contour . " " L-T , " Cahalan whispered , " I 've got the GreenMan . " The GreenMan was at the forward TOC on Firebase Barnett . For him the day had held several torturous decisions , the most difficult having been whether or not to commit Bravo Company to a fullscaleassault against the NVA bunker complex . Rain and fog had socked in the valley and the rear and all helicopter support except emergency medical evacuation had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would run the risk of being hit tonight or Bravo could attack without helicopter support . Bravo attacked . When Cahalan reached the GreenMan , Bravo had overrun the bunker complex , killed seventeen enemy soldiers and suffered five wounded . The medevac bird from Eagle Dust-Off , along with four escort Cobras and a chase ship , a Huey on station to pick up the medevac crew should that helicopter be shot down , was approaching Bravo 's location . " Quiet Rover , this is Red Rover , " the GreenMan snarled after Brooks had reported briefly about the enemy road , " proceed to your echo by november echo ASAP . Caution your papa Sky Devil Six is to your november one kilo . Play ball with Sky Devil . " " Who 's Sky Devil ? " De Barti asked Cahalan . " Ah , that 'd be Delta Company , Sir , " Cahalan answered . " Oh fuck , " De Barti groaned . " Not that clusterfuck . " Brooks described the road in greater detail , hoping the GreenMan would be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his company march down the enemy road . It appeared impossible to cross the road and ascend the cliffs at that point , yet he felt he had to get off the valley floor . As he conversed on the radio the sound of helicoptersabove the valley pulsated the wet air . " Get me a full reconnaissance of that feature , " the GreenMan directed . " And , play ball with Sky Devil . Out . " Oh shit , Brooks thought . " Roger that , niner . Wilco . Out . " Brooks looked around . He directed Cahalan to establish communication with Delta Company to determine Delta 's exact position and to see if the Delta Darlings had found a way up and down the cliff face . " Tell them , " Brooks said , " Red Rover wants us to rendezvous . It'llp355be a hell of a lot better if we can get up to them on the ridge than to have them come down here . " Brooks turned to FO again and asked , " Where do you think this road goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FO said . " Like you figure , it probably follows the contours pretty close . If the dinks are moving heavy material , they 'd a built the road as level as possible . " " After we get out of range , have arty seal this thing off behind us . See if they 'll drop some rounds west of here right now . " It was 1800 hours when Alpha began moving again . Garbageman was still at point , Smitty and Pop walked a double slack . Slowly , apprehensively , Garbageman stepped onto the road and into the dark corridor formed by the grass wall and the cliff . He scanned up and back . Fog limited visibility to under twenty meters . The pointmanturned right and began moving . Carefully he checked the mountainwall which rose to his left . The slacks emerged from the grass eight feet behind point , they split and walked one on each side of the road . Mohnsen and Jones emerged next continuing the double patternset by the slacks , then Greer and Roberts , Sklar and De Barti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like this one fucken bit , Garbageman whispered to himself . He stopped and crouched . Both slacks moved up and squatted by the point . " This is a Goddamned highway , " Garbageman whispered . " Man I do n't dig this shit one fucken bit . This do n't even make sense . " " Want me to walk point ? " Pop asked , his eyes twinkling . That was the ultimate affront , the most severe attack on the Garbageman 's manhood and pride . " Naw , " he whispered . " I can do it . " Maybe we ought a both do it , " Pop gave him an alternative that he could accept without losing face . " Ah , yeah , " Garbageman seized the chance . They rose and with one at each edge proceeded in double point with a single slack. 2d Plt was followed onto the road by the remainder of the CP . All the RTOs had folded their flexible radio antennas that protruded from their rucks and labeled them as valuable communication targets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cahalan stuck his into a hole in his shirt , Brown rolled his in a loop and forced it back down into the ruck. 3d Plt followed the CP and 1st followed 3d . They moved very slowly , very quietly . It took almost half an hour for the retire column to turn the corner from the narrow jungle grass passage unto the enemy supply road . The boonierats continued the double column . They remained on the road , heading east , looking ( or an opening iii the cliff they might ascend up to the ridge . Theyp356maintained wide intervals . By the time Silvers , at drag , finally stepped onto the road , Alpha was spread 125 meters long . Silvers came onto the road behind Brunak . He stood at the intersection for several minutes , staring to the rear , allowing the column to progress away from him . An artillery round burst 700 meters west , the concussion rumbling up the road and echoing in from the south escarpment a fraction of a second apart . Silvers turned and quickly marched to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from where he had left the grass he turned to look back . A single explosive pop cracked the air . Silvers dropped in the center of the road . Every man in Alpha dove for cover . There was another crack . Boonierats dove into the grass , scrambled for concealment , searched for a target . Brunak had been hit by the second round . " Bravo Bravo , " a squashed tight-chest scream for a medic escaped from his throat . Boonierats raced through the grass toward him . No one had found a target . No one fired . Marko , Jax and Lairds surroundedBrunak . They expected follow-up fire . None came . Marko aimed his 60 down the road . There was nothing there . He aimed the weapon over Silvers ' body which had collapsed backward onto the rucksack it had been carrying . Silvers ' helmet had fallen off and rolled away . His legs had doubled beneath his body before the body had toppled backward and spread across the pack . The head slumped back over the ruck , the eyes stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trespassed . " Bravo , " Jax yelled from beside Brunak . Egan , Whiteboy and Doc McCarthy came crashing through the grass . Others were coming back . Most had shed their rucks . Brunak screamed . McCarthy squatted by his side . 1st Sqd with Egan and several others maneuvered down through the grass past Silvers and formed a perimeter . Cherry , Thomaston and Moneski 's squad reacted second , rushingback and reinforcing the soldiers about Brunak . Doc Johnson sprinted down the center of the road running like a madman , his aid bag in one hand , a .45 in the other . Doc dove into the mud behind Silvers . He got to his knees and hunched over the body . There was a splat of blood in the center of Silvers ' throat . Working quickly yet gently Doc lifted Leon 's head . The neck no longer had a back . The bullet had entered through the soft flesh below Silvers ' chin then tumbled and ripped its way out the nape of the neck carrying most of the cervical vertebrae , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , veins and a tremendous amount of blood . In the grass McCarthy worked on Brunak . Brunak had caught a round in the right side . It was difficult to determine how badly he had been hit but McCarthy was sure it was bad . Brunak was laugh/ing , then tensing , cramping his entire body , then laughing again , flowing from consciousness , pain and spasms , to empty shock . McCarthyapplied a field dressing to the hole in Brunak 's side and jabbed him with a syringe of morphine . From his aid bag he took a 500m1 plastic bag labeled Plasma Protein Fraction ( Human ) . The plasma solution came in a kit complete with IV needle and airway cannula . McCarthy pumped Brunak 's arm then jammed the needle in . He knew he was missing as soon as the needle broke the skin . He yanked it out . Brunak flinched . Then he laughed . McCarthy stuck him again and began the IV flow . On the trail Doc Johnson had closed Silvers ' eyes . The medic methodically wrapped a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one would see the extent of the damage . Doc pulled a towel from Silvers ' ruck and placed part of it behind Leon 's head . He brought the remainder over the sallow face . Then , holding his aid bag , Doc rolled off the trail into the grass . Cherry squatted in the grass beside Thomaston . He awaited directions . Egan came back to them . He grabbed the handset , radioed El Paso , explained the situation , and requested a priority medevac . Ile tossed the hook back to Cherry and snapped , " Git down . I do n't want to call in a bird for you too . " Hoover crawled over to the group about Brunak . Thomaston grabbed his hook and radioed the CP . " We 're movin back into the grass fifty meters , " he said after talking to Brooks . " We 'll get the Dust-Off out there . " Thomaston and Egan directed the perimeter to move further clown while they , with Jax ' help , pulled Silvers ' body from the road . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearing toward the valley center , Egan and Jax jumped back onto the road and pulled Silvers ' body , ruck and weapon into the grass . Jax separatedthe ruck from the body of his dead field partner . He lifted the body gently and carried it to the clearing . " Yo gowin be alright now , Icon , my friend , " Jax whispered soothingly . " Yo kin relax an fo'get his place . " Cherry followed carrying the blood-soaked ruck . Lairds brought the extra weapon and helmet . Brunak , McCarthy and 2d Sqd had already reached and secured the clearing . 3d Plt pulled back to reinforce the evac site , 2d Plt and the CP circled the perimeter in recon patrols , pushing to points 100 meters from the designated pick-up zone . " Hey , " Egan said to Cherry . " You need some good shit ? " " What shit ? " " Here , " Egan said rustling through Silvers ' equipment . He tossed Cherrry a two-quart canteen . Cherry looked at it , then walked over to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a five-quart water blivet . Cherry untied it . The blivet was a double-layered plastic bladder enclosed in a strong nylon bag , the three bags joined at the top with a canteen neck and screw cap . Water blivets were less cumbersome than canteens and they could be used as pillows . They were in very short supply . " I 'd like to take this , " Cherry said . " You got it , " Egan answered . " And his bayonet . " " Take it . " Numbnuts let Cherry and Egan leave the ruck before he went over and scavenged all C-rat meals that were not Ham and Lima Beans . Denhardt scavenged Brunak 's ruck . It was after sunset , late dusk , when the medical evacuation helicopter finally found Alpha . The thick mist prevented the DustOffcommander from seeing marking smoke and it was not dark enough to use the mini-strobes . The birds even had difficulty finding the valley for all of northern I Corps lay in thick fog and rain . The Dust-Off had first to locate Barnett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due west . Cherry directed the bird 's approach by ear . " You 're passing to our sierra maybe two hundred meters , " he called . Then again , " You 're approaching us . You 're passing over us right , right . . . now . " The helicopter made a half-dozen passes , at first so high it could not be seen through the fog , then lower and lower . Finally it hovered 15 meters over their position . From the ground Cherry could see the crew chief standing on the left skid and the medic standing on the right . Huge red crosses were painted on white squares on the bird 's bottom and sides . The rotor wash from the bird made the rain slam down and sting on upturned faces . Escort ships could be heard circling though they could not be seen . From the right side of the helicopter stuck a three-foot arm and from that dropped a small torpedo-shaped object on a steel cable . The torpedo dropped evenly and in seconds it was on the ground . Doc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torpedo and unfolded it . " What 's that thing ? " Cherry questioned . " Jungle penetrator , " Egan answered . The four men lifted Brunak and his gear and strapped him into a sitting position on the now unfolded , tri-pronged , anchor-like seat . They strapped his gear across from him . Thomaston stretched his arms up over his head and extended his thumbs signaling the crew chief to take him away . The hoist cranked and Brunak rose , swayed beneath the bird , and ascended . The medic reached out and pulled him in . The bird departed , circled and returned . The procedure wasp359repeated with the body and gear of Leon Silvers . Then the medevac departed for good . No trace of the dead or the wounded remained except for blood and neck tissue in the midst of the enemy road and the blood stain on Cherry 's water blivet.  |p360Bug  repellent was also used to repel leeches . Typically boonierats carried several plastic bottles of the fluid . By 2300 hours every soldier in Alpha had run out . That night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Leech Reef . They called the night Bloodsucker 's Bitterness . The bloodsuckerswere not all leeches . It had been nearly dark when the medevac departed and Alpha had formed up again , in column again , on the road again . Brooks had opted for a quick 200-meter hump east up the roadway . He had hoped to find a passage up the cliffs to the north ridge . Tension amongst the men was high . With every step every man searched the corridor walls left and right , top and bottom . At drag Marko , Jax , Egan and Cherry walked backward . Fifty meters behind Whiteboy and his squad followed . They had dropped off in hopes of catching NVA trail watchers popping up after the column . At point Garbageman , Pop , Smitty and Mohnsen walked a staggeredlead sweep , each scrutinizing one parameter of the corridor . Innumerable sites along the road indicated signs of enemy troops moving into the elephant grass . Footprints in the mud filled with water as the point element approached . At two points where minute trails exited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall swayed not from wind but from having been brushed . He saw nothing . Where trails intersected with the road , riflemen stood guard for the column , 16s or 60s aimed up the secondary routes . All weapons were off safe , on automatic . This was unusual for the normal unsure footing demanded the precaution of keeping weapons on safe . An index finger was kept on the trigger and a thumb on the safety lever.  |p361The  two could be squeezed simultaneously taking no more time than only squeezing the trigger . An unofficial agreement had passed through Alpha when the boonierats had moved out . That they moved out at all was a testament to the faith they had in Brooks . Brooks was aware of their faith and loyalty . He gritted his teeth and told himself it was the only way . Mohnsen had glanced conspiratorially at Smith then clicked to full automatic , Smith turned to Jones , Jones to Garbageman . In back Egan nodded to Cherry . At middle El Paso nodded to FO and FO to the L-T . The nods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to encompass the entire column . All weapons were aimed outward from the advancingdouble column . The rain had subsided , abated to a drizzlemist and the temperaturehad fallen from cool to cold to very cold . In the lushly vegetated mountains of the Annamite Range rainy season temperatures of 30  --  F were neither incongruous nor unknown and nights below 40  --  were common . But in August , temperatures seldom fell below 50  --  and the boonierats of Alpha were not dressed for the cold . Coupled with the wet , the cold chilled them to miserable teeth chattering . Being on the roads with night 's edge on the sky increased their inner trembling . Their eyes played tricks as they stared up the cliffs or up the road or into the grass . Shadows darted about , poked up in peripheral vision then vanished under direct scrutiny . " Keep pushing , " Brooks radioed forward . " Keep it moving . Find a passage up the cliffs . " But there was no passage . The wall to their left rose vertically as a single monolith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooks ordered the unit to halt . Whiteboy 's squad caught up , the column squeezed together , closed intervals from ten feet to three . On command the soldiers turned right 90  --  and dissolved into the grass . They swept in like a silent wave , breaking after 100 meters . The flanks contracted and with the instinct of well-disciplined troops the boonierats formed an irregular oval perimeter . Quietly the perimeterguards laid down and arranged guard schedules . The leech assault began immediately . At Alpha 's center the CP formed a tight nucleus . " Do n't dig in , " Brooks whispered to El Paso . " No noise , no movement , no lights . Get that word out . We 're going to hide here . I do n't want to hear the sound of digging . " Then to El Paso Brooks said unofficially , " Every time we dig I feel like I 'm digging my own grave . " Beside the company commander FO and Brown had buried themselves beneath two ponchos . By flashlight FO studied the topo map and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm goina bring in arty all over that road . FO called the FDC on Barnett and gave ap362long list of coordinates . First he called in DTs for Alpha , then he called in the road . He discussed the target with the artillery commander . Without being able to observe the impactions it would be impossible to ascertain the extent of damage the rounds were causingor , indeed , if the rounds were even hitting the target . Five meters too far to the north and the rounds would land up the cliff , perhaps caving sections of cliff in upon the road . That would be of little use . The NVA would use the loose dirt and rock to improve the road surface . Rounds landing five meters too far south would impact in the elephant grass and not affect the road at all . Only direct hits at road center would cause the NVA to slow . The craters would fill with water and vehicular traffic would bog down in the quagmire . With luck , arty would blow the ceiling off the corridor and expose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in detail . And he described the cliffs . The battery commander asked FO to wait one . He checked with the forward TOC on the firebase and with the main TOC at Evans . He radioed FO back . The road would receive H &; I fire , later , maybe . From Barnett he did not believe he could drop rounds onto the road . His guns were north of the cliffs and the road was protected . But possibly , the eight-inchers at Firebase Bastogne far to the south , if they had time and if they had no higher priority missions , might drop a few rounds in the vicinity of the road . That was the best he could do . Cherry and Egan slithered to the CP for the nightly meeting . " Do you guys have any extra bug repellent ? " Brooks asked . " Aw fuck , " Egan growled quietly . He had soaked his fatigues with every drop of repellent he had had . " I was hopin you had some . These mothafuckers are suckin me dry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paso whispered matter-of-factly . " Numbnuts got one in his ass , " Cherry chuckled . " Musta had to share the space with his head , " Brown whispered laughing . They bantered back and forth very quietly and moved closer and closer . They sat together in a cluster with Brooks at the center . There were thirteen of them , the seven from the CP , Egan , Cherry and Jax from 1st Pit , De Barti and Garbageman from 2d , and Caldwell from 3d . Each man was wrapped in a poncho liner for warmth and over that in a poncho to keep the leeches out . Had it been light enough to see , the cluster would have looked like thirteen crumpled dirty bags of trash tossed atop one another in a muck snot swamp . In the blackness they were nothing but thirteen quivering voices . Some chattered from the wet and cold . Some shivered feelingthe crawling cool clamminess of endless legions of leeches inchingever closer to their flesh.  |p363Ah  , for a smoke , Egan thought . To smoke and burn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fucken night . Fucken light discipline . Ca n't light up . Most of these assholes do n't have a goddamndry cigarette . Assholes . How many times do ya have to tell em to keep their smokes in their ammo cans . Jax moaned . " Oh Man , these mothafuckas eatin me up . Up the side my head , they done whup . These mothafuckas eatin good tanight . On that road , friends , they eatin right . " " Ssshhh , " Brooks hushed Jax . " Cahalan , report . " Cahalan reported . He went into detail about Bravo 's action at what they now called Comeback Ridge . Then he described Recon 's skirmish . Cahalan had questioned the TOC RTOs about the various actions by US and ARVN forces in and around Khe Ta Laou . He reiterated all he had learned and then he recounted Alpha 's own day formally concluding with a Lessons Learned section based on discussionsBrooks had had with FO and Thomaston and others about the river crossing and about how Silvers was killed and how it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security for the second road march . Only now did the reality of Silvers ' death begin to hit Cherry . He had gone into shock , functioning perfectly yet not recognizing the meaning of the events about him . It was a perfect soldier 's reaction and though it made Cherry sorrowful , it also made him happy . Now , in the dark quiet , he could ponder . What 'd I do with that address he gave me ? Cherry asked himself . I told him I 'd send his stuff to somebody . What stuff . They took it all away with his body . Cherry pondered the death itself . But it was difficult for Cherry to think about death . He did not have words and concepts to build his thoughts . There had been his Christian upbringing and his biological science courses and each had provided him with a set of theoretical constructs to frame his thoughts but he had rejected the first and tonight the second seemed inadequate . Cherry put his hand to his right calf . The new bayonet was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . He smiled . All around him the others chattedsoftly . " Hey , Doc , " Brown whispered . " Yeah , " Doc answered . " OOOO , Doc ! Lieutenant Caldwell 's got the funniest red mark on his ass . " " What that ? " " I ai nt sure , " Brown chuckled . " I think maybe it 's lipstick . " " Bullshit , " Caldwell said seriously offended . " Cut that chatter . " Disgust with Caldwell had passed among all the EM of Alpha.  | " When the dinks opened up , " Brown laughed more quietly , " I saw him kiss his ass good-bye . " Brooks stifled a snicker . " Hey , " he stopped the peripheral talk , " listen up . There are times , " he said very solemnly altering the mood , " when a man or men follow another man simply because the other man is in a position of authority . If you all followed me unquestioninglyand you did n't give me advice , we 'd all be dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomorrow , we 're sending a platoon to rendezvous with Delta and the rest of us are going to probe all over this valley . Maybe we 'll cross back over to the other side . " " We ai nt goin back on that road ? " Garbageman asked , said . " I think we ought to stay off it , Ruf , " De Barti agreed with Garbageman . " At least as much as possible . " " GreenMan wants us to find a way up the cliff and mark it , " Brooks said . " We might need it later . Besides , we have to find it to meet with Delta . " " This is fucked down here , Mista , " Doc said disgustedly . " We stay in this valley , we gon na rot . " " I do n't like it either , " FO said . " That dink this afternoon . He must have counted every man in our column . I just know he did . He counted every 60 , every radio . You can forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They know everything about us . You can bet yer ass that dink gets a gold star for today . " " Those Puckers , " Garbageman cursed . " Them shithead bastards . It seems like they always know where we 're at . They 're goina snipe the shit outa us . " " They gowin suck us in , " Jax said . " They gowin leave us signs like an in-vi-tation . Then they gowin shut the door . This pig shit . This white man 's war . " " Come on , Man , " Egan said quietly . " Have n't we had enough of that crap . " Before the meeting Egan had had to quiet Jax and Marko . Silvers had been Jackson 's field partner and Brunak as AG had been Marko 's . Jax and Marko buddied up as soon as the medevac bird departed . Then Egan and Thomaston had come and appointed Jacksonsquad leader . Marko thought the promotion should have been hisWhen they moved into the new NDP the two had huddled and pointed their weapons outward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jax , you got a chick ? " " Shee-it Man , " Jax answered jiving quietly , " I got all kinda chicks . Black en white . They loves my ass . " " Man , what I would n't give to see a round-eye right now , " Marko said.  | " Roun-eye ! ? " Jax exclaimed . This man need some educatin , he thought . " Doan give me none that roun-eye shit . Eyes ai nt roun . Roun-eye ? Ma-aann . Yo white fuckas always screamin roun-eye when yo mean white . " " I do n't give a rat 's ass what color she is long 's she pink inside , " Marko countered . " I 'd ball a black bitch ta be outta here right now . " " Yo honkey mothafucka , " Jax seethed . " Yo mean yo 'd ee-ven stick yo golden dick in black pussy . Yo 'd even lower yoself that far ta get out a heah . We here cause a white fucken pigs . " " Augh you fucken son of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt . " When you goina see this ai nt white America 's war fought by his nigger slaves . What the fuck do you think I am ? White dudes like me get blown away more often than niggers like you . You fucken black bastards sold your souls . Your people sold their yellow Bros down the fucken drain , Boy , just so they could be like us whites . This ai nt whitey 's war , nigger . It 's our war . " Jax was ready to kill Marko . No one called Jackson a nigger . Jax began a suffocated scream . Egan had come down and grabbed them both and had drained the fury . He had talked to them quietly and had asked them both to come to the CP meeting to bring up their debate . Jax had come alone . " Yo ask me up here yoself , " Jax reminded Egan . " Hey , " Brooks said . " First let 's settle the local problems . Then we can work on the world situation . " They returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our ultimate objective is theme high feature by the river . That knoll with the big tree . Our ultimate mission is to clear the NVA from the center of the valley . Those goals establish the parameters of our actions . " " Our ultimate goal , " Doc said , " is ta remain alive . " Doc had been unusually quiet ever since the medevac . Silvers had not been the first dead man he had evacuated and he would not be the last . And Brunak would not be the last of the wounded . Somehow , their shootings affected Doc more deeply than any before . Perhaps it was because 1st Sqd , 1st Plt was , except for that Numbnuts character , among the best squads Doc had ever seen . They were always alert , vigilant . If they were so easily sniped was n't he all the more vulnerable ? Doe 's usual speech was a mixture of city-black street dialect and army/boonierat jargon . Now he spoke with an almost professionaleloquence . " Leon Silvers died instantly , " Doc said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's quick . Brunak is gon na be different . That man has a long struggle ahead of him , if he makes it . When they hoisted him this afternoon he was in deep hypovolemic shock . He was losing a lot of blood and it wasn'tp366coming out . That means edema , the effusion of serous fluids into intracellular space . McCarthy had n't inserted the IV properly and Brunak 's vascular system was draining . Dig ? There wo n't enough blood left in him for his heart to pump . He gone into tachycardia . " " What 's that mean , Doc ? " De Barti asked . " His heart beating at an excessive rate , " Doc said . " It was tryin ta pump up the pressure in a system that was full a holes . " " He 's goina make it , ai nt he , Doc ? " " I talked to the TOC bout an hour ago , " Doc answered . " They doan have no word yet . " No one spoke so Doc Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said sliding to his less formal speech . " One question . How many mo mothafuckas we gon na git blown away fo we reach that ultimate objective ? We got men here sufferin from immersion foot , from jungle rot . Half the company 's got colds and half gon na catch pneumonia . What the fuck fo , Mista ? " " We bein Judas Goats fo a whiteman 's operation , " Jax said . " They sendin us down here ta git slaughtered so they know right where ta drop the bombs . That way they doan have ta spend so much money on bombs cause they ken drop less . " " No company of mine is going to be slaughtered , " Brooks said firmly . He had heard enough of their complaints . " It pisses me off to hear you guys talk like that , like ... " El Paso interrupted him . " Yes , " he said , " but we can talk about it , ca n't we ? " Brooks looked through the darkness toward El Paso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response . No one else spoke . Brooks could not think of an alternative . He was trapped . Later he would think to himself , I should have said , ' Yes , you can talk , but let 's talk tactics first . ' Now he could not think . He wanted their opinions but he wanted them to agree with his own . " Maybe , " Lt. Caldwell said , " you men should think more about killing dinks than about turning chicken and running . " " Fuck that shit , " Egan snapped angrily at Caldwell . " Wait a minute , " Brooks said tenuously . " This meeting is open . El Paso 's right . We can talk . " They spoke quickly now , all except Caldwell without anger . Each man was firmly entrenched in his own convictions yet each was willing to sway , to lean , just a little because the other men were boonierats . From that base they spoke and listened to each other respectively . " I 'd like to know something , " Cherry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell we 're doin here . " El Paso took him by as much surprise as Doc had earlier even though he had heard El Paso 's scholarly speech before . " The prob/lent , " El Paso began , " problems , encountered in trying to resolve which historical antecedents caused our intervention and what the historical morality of that intervention is , are complicated by our inability to withdraw to a greater perspective and also by the ongoingoccurrence of events . " That , Cherry thought , has got to be a prepared speech . " It is as if historical perspective were depth , " El Paso said . " And that depth is a cone . The greater the depth the greater also the diameter . Every year we descend into history we find not simply greater lineal understanding of today 's events but we also find these events inseparably tied to other events . Looking at today is like looking at the point of the cone . Looking at historical antecedents is looking into the cone . To get an accurate understandingof today we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanding strata below . At a certain point the known details and connections begin to diminish and the cone reverses and becomes smaller until it points out and there we are in pre-history . " " Wow ! " De Barti exclaimed . " That 's beautiful . " " Well , what 's that all mean ? " Garbageman asked . " What do you call that ? " De Barti asked . " I understand what you 're saying , " Cherry said , " but that does n't answer why we 're here . " " That , " El Paso chuckled to De Barti , " is El Paso 's biconoid theory of history . " " Biconoid ? Biconoid ? " Egan repeated to himself . " Two cones , " he said . " Joined at the base , " El Paso added . He was pleased . " So what ? " Caldwell said . " So , " El Paso said moving on , " it depends on how far back and how wide you want to go to justify or explain or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 've been over a lot of that before , " Brooks said . " You ever hear of the Oxford Oath ? " Egan asked El Paso . " About 1935 ? " El Paso replied . " Yep , " Egan said . He had thought he would catch El Paso with that one . He had tried many times and only rarely succeeded . " Well , what is it ? " Cherry asked . " It was a sworn statement , " Egan said . " And a slogan . It was somewhat the equivalent of chanting ' Stop the War in Vietnam . ' " " Huh ? " " It was a movement in England , " El Paso explained . " About ' 35 or ' 36 . It was an oath where students resolved never to bear arms for king or country . The oath was agreed to by a majority of Oxford Union members . The Oxford Union was a nationwide student orga/nization . They say Hitler used to quote it to his general staff to lessen their anxiety when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitler said it was evidence the British were rotten to the core and that his staff was exaggerating the risk of his moves . " " It allowed Hitler to advance unchallenged , " Egan said . " That 's just what the NVA are thriving on too . Vo Nguyen Giap uses student dissent in the World to dupe his dinks into thinking we 're weak . And that 's only where it begins . China and Russia use it too . Ya know , maybe we 're here simply as a show of strength and will . And that show is a deterrent . It keeps the Commies in check so they do n't blunder us into a thermo-nuclear holocaust . That wo n't happen if Tricky Dick keeps a shit load of us here . We become a safety valve for world tension . " " That 's a bunch a shit , " FO countered quietly . " We 're more apt to blunder us into World War Three by being here than by withdrawing . " " What about the Middle East ? " Egan said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Russkie troops manning SAM missiles . We back down here what 's goina keep the Kremlin from pushin inta Israel ? That would blow up the earth . We ca n't just say w , o ai nt goina defend our allies . Be just like the ' 30s . Mao 'd take Taiwan . Russia 'd take Berlin . The communists 'd move in everywhere . " " You Americans , " Minh said softly . He did not want to speak with so many GIs clustered for he felt very much alienated when they had these discussions , but he could no longer allow them to prattle without injecting his thoughts . " You Americans , " he repeated , " you are most blind . You do not see my country or my people . All you see are your words . We were reduced to ignorant childslavesunder the yoke of colonialism . It is not communism you most protect us from . Communism is not a threat to us . We need your support to keep out a foreign enemy . Soon we will not need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become communist . It will be communism for us , not against you . We must be the ones to have power over ourselves . " " Amen , Brother , " Jax whispered enthusiastically . " Vietnamese Power to Vietnamese People . Black Power to Black People . " " And White Power to White People , " Brown added . " Amen , " Doc said . " If you view the world , " El Paso began , as Western and Easternpower centers and vast power voids , the expansion of communismsince , well , 1917 , is a simple swinging back of the slow moving power pendulum pushed to one extreme by colonialism . The Europeansexpanded outward from the 1400s to like 1945 . Communismp369is a backlash movement for a lot of countries that were once colonies . If it 's strong today that 's because colonialism was strong earlier . " " I 'm not sure I follow that , " De Barti said . " During the colonial period western European nations sought to impose their religions and cultures on native population , savages as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  including America . " " Oh yes , " Minh spoke again . " But America is not a good example of colonialism . Europe did not colonize a native population in America . " " Well , yeah , " El Paso agreed but also disagreed . He did not wish to discuss America . He said , " They did in South and Central America . In North America the Europeans simply exterminated the Indians . " " Yes , that is what I mean , " Minh said . " Your Indians were replaced by American Europeans . America never experienced the cultural shock of being colonized . " " That 's very true , " El Paso conceded . He moved on quickly trying to maintain his momentum but was cut off . " Unless you were black , " Brooks said . " Or Indian , Mexican , Eskimo or some other intrinsic minority , " El Paso regained control . " But that 's the thing with communism in ex-colonies . You see , it 's a backlash to the cultural shock of colonialism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religions , and economies . They converted the native culture to Western , tried to anyway . Entire value systems were disrupted . That caused tremendous stress which continues today . " " Oh yes , " Minh said . " And your technology also disrupts my culture . " " That disrupts our own culture too , Minh , " De Barti said . " But why communism ? " Egan asked . " There has n't been a society in history in which Marxist collectivization has been popular . Communist states are always police states . Commie economic policies always destroy their own economy . No one , once it 's been accomplished , likes it . Minh , it 'll be either you join the collective farm or factory or they 'll kill you . It 's that simple . " " They 've got to try it , " El Paso said . " Coming out of colonialism is like coming out of childhood , like going through adolescence . I'liey 've got to experience it all in order to decide in which direction to go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring if you read t he doctrines . It really sounds wonderful . It demands justice for the exploited . " " Yeah , but in reality it doubles the exploitation , " Egan said.  | " It always denies freedoms , " Brown added . " Yeah , it coerces people to keep from falling on its face , " Cahalan said . " So did colonialism , " El Paso answered . " What we must have , " Minh said , " is a Vietnamese government which takes the best of all foreign worlds . It must eat and digest the good and let it help us grow as a Vietnamese nation . " " I 'd still like to know what we 're doin here , " Cherry said . " We 're stopping the North Vietnamese from invading South Vietnam , " Caldwell said bluntly . Cherry 's inability to perceive the obvious , along with Brooks ' and the others ' infuriated him . They do n't have to understand it , he thought . It is simply fact . God , does it have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell 's the matter with you all ? " Caldwell whispered severely . " Why are we here ? What do we want ? " He mocked them . He aimed his voice at Cherry . " We want the fighting to stop , the opposing forces to disengageand withdraw . We 're ready to negotiate a peaceful solution . " Caldwell directed his voice toward Minh . " We 'll support you . Guaranteeyou free elections , give you democracy . If you go . . . ah . . . if your people want to unify with the dinks , that 's their prerogative . We 're only here to make sure it 's not shoved down your throats by foreign invaders . " " You ca n't give anyone democracy , " El Paso said maliciously . " Not what you mean . Democracy like you mean is a western culturalthing . You 're trying to cram American standards down the throats of a culture that does n't hold that standard and you 're demanding they fight for it . Man , that 's straight Nixon logic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own culture and be like you Anglos . " " You going to tell me these people 'd be better off under that henchman Ho Chi Minh ? " El Paso did not answer . " Well , come on , " Caldwell taunted . " Let me tell you something . The Ho Chi Minh government at the time of our initial involvement did n't represent even fifteen percent of the people of the North and not two percent of the people in the South . It was n't a legal representative of the country . The government we back down here had as much support as that bitch did in the North . There were two main differences . The North was a closed and repressive society and Ho usurped complete control . Anybody not liking it was killed . Down here it was an open society , open to world view and criticism , and to opposition political factions . Maybe there 's corruption keeping the factions limited but factions are allowed . Now , perhaps because of American aid , the government here has fifty percent popularp371support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legal government ? " " I must ask you , " Minh said , " what you believe made Ho Chi Minh ? Or a Hitler ? Or any dictator ? Ho , he was pushed to power because the Japanese and Chinese feared America . We feared Americawould make us a French colony again . What do you believe consolidated his power ? Was it not America 's over-zealous manner of being helpful ? To many of my countrymen your assistance appears to be aggression and imperialism . Yes , my friend , your solution may be better than a northern solution , but it can only be better if it is without you . " " That 's a lot of shit , Minh , " Caldwell said defending his statements . " You 've got a closed society in the North . You 've got a repressive government there . Look how far you 've come . When Westy took command of MACV in ' 64 terrorists were bombing right inside Saigon with ease and regularity . Nobody believed in a republic here in the South . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've grown . Your government 's working . Your military 's become decent . Your country is going places . " Brooks interceded . " I have to agree with Lt. Caldwell , " he said to the shock of El Paso and Doc and Jax . Even Egan could hardly believe it . How could anyone side with Boy Asshole ? " I think he 's right , " Brooks said . " We 've given a nation time to settle and grow . " " Yo bein sucked in by that line , L-T , " Jax said . " Perhaps , " Brooks agreed , " but if that line is the truth , I 'm willing to be sucked in by it . " Another man 's words haunted the back of Brooks ' consciousness . He had not thought about them since he had first heard them . Nor had he placed much importance on them when they were spoken . Now their meaning crystalized . ' If you believe in what you are fighting for , ' the Old Fox had said at the staging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You are more apt to win . You will not fight badly , thus you are less apt to die . The more you risk death the less apt you are to die . Your men , Lieutenant , must believe in what they are doing . ' Brooks said , " Jax , do n't you believe we 're helping the South Vietnamese to maintain a free society ? If the North conquers the South they 'll establish a slave state . Hey ? " " I agree with the L-T , " Cahalan said . " So do I , " said Brown . " That 's simplistic bullshit , " Egan whispered to Cherry so only Cherry could hear . " See , " Lt. Caldwell said . " I tell ya , I 'm right . " " I tell ya , " Egan snarled , " yer an asshole . " " You best remember your mariners , Troop , " Caldwell said.  | " In a leech 's ass , " Egan challenged . " Stop it , " Brooks said firmly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seethed . " Or slack ? " Garbageman whispered . " Thomaston , De Barti , L-T , you all take your turn . " " That is not ... " Brooks stopped them all . " We will not proceed with this line of thought , " he said . " I 'd like ta say something , " Egan began in a different tone . " Ya know that red ball , that first one this mornin ? I bet that fucker led to an entrance at the base of the hill where Whiteboy 's Hole was . They might have bunkers and tunnels all through these hills . We might be better off down here hidin in the grass . If it was n't for the leeches this would n't be so bad . " Then he said , " I was also thinkin bout Ridgefield and our token Jew . Ridge ... " go . " That token Jew was a friend a mine , " Cherry said . He touched his hand to his calf and felt the bayonet and felt a pang of guilt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Egan snapped . " You 're such a fucken cherry . " " Stop , " Brooks said . " We do n't meet to call each other names . " " Sorry , " Cherry whispered . " Yeah . Me too , " Egan said . " That 's it . Break it up , " Brooks said . The meeting broke quickly with the platoon people returning to their perimeter areas . Doc and El Paso accompanied Jax , Egan and Cherry to 1st Plt 's location leaving Brooks wondering if he was losing his ability to command his company . " That white sonavabitch Nixon , " Jax said when he and the others settled , " he ai nt nothin but a plague on mankind . Man , that dude sly . He one cagey mothafucka . They makin money off us . They makin money off Israel . Sure they 's concerned . This place fall , it like sewin up their pockets . I says , Save Our Blood . Doan do my of lady no good I get blow 'd way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord let Leon rest in peace . We got brothers en sisters in jail , Man . In jail in the World . I 'd rather git scattered stormin the prison that got Bobby Seale chained up then in some fucken valley ai nt nobody give a shit bout . " " Amen , Bro , " El Paso said . They were all speaking very calmly " How come yer always such a prick ? " Cherry shot the question at Egan . " You 're so fucken obnoxious you 're unreal . " " Do n't mean nothin , " Egan laughed . " It 's all academic anyway . Ai nt nobody here but us and the dinks an there ai nt no place else tap373now . " Peace marches , they got their place . Everybody standin round flippin each other peace signs . But that ai nt where it 's at . " " That right , " Jax said . " Things is rotten to the core . We got ta git down , deal on em , overthrow the government . " " Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Doc said in his deep voice . " You white people , you just now catchin on . " " They suckin our blood , " Jax said , " They the baddest blood-suckers . " " Amen , " El Paso sighed . " Goddamn Jews own half a Harlem , " Doc said . " They keep my brothers en sisters in the ghetto . They sic the fuzz on us , keep us down . They take all the money out a our neighborhoods so our schools are bad so we ca n't never learn an get out . That outside interference , Mista . Black people got ta have Black Power . We got ta run our own schools . Have our own doctors , our own police , our own judges . You understand what I 'm sayin ? " " Ah , do n't be duped , Man , " Egan said . " They do it in white neighborhoods too . A pig 's a pig . " They talked on . The night was very dark and very wet and very cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one point , as Egan was catnapping , the cool slime of a crawling bloodsucker on his lips woke him . " Eech , " he coughed , spit , shaking his head as the leech dropped into his mouth . Periodically each man wiped his hands over his body , extra carefully about his privates , checking for leeches . Sometimes a small leech would be found unattached and it would be squished between thumb and forefinger . Sometimes a large leech would be found attached . All Alpha was out of repellent and even those with dry cigarettes did not dare light up . With fingernails they dug into their own flesh and pinched away at the buried head , usually snapping the leech at the neck and leaving the mouth . After the leech died , the wound burned . " You know that poster , " Cherry whispered to El Paso late in the night , " ya know that one , ' WHAT IF THEY GAVE A WAR AND NO ONE SHOWED UP ? ' What if we did n't come and the NVA did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ El Paso smiled in the dark . Cherry still did not understand , he thought . Maybe he 's even regressing . El Paso sighed weakly and thought Cherry would need a long time to crawl out from under his thick layers of campus propaganda and government indoctrination . Neither side has the answer , he thought . " What if they gave a war and only one side showed up ? " El Paso asked him . " Huh ? "  | " That has happened , you know , " El Paso said gently . They were sitting very close to each other wrapped like five enchiladas in their ponchos and poncho liners . They spoke very quietly , speaking directly into one another 's ears . " It happened in Russia under Stalin and in China under Mao . They called it a purge . " " Aw , you know what I mean , " Cherry said . " Yes , " El Paso said . " But it 's dangerous to talk in slogans like that . " He spoke very easily . He wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Would you like to hear more Vietnamese history , Brother ? " " Yes , " Cherry said . " I 'd like to know it all . " " Just a little , eh ? Then we 'll give Egan the radios and we 'll cut some Zs . Maybe you would like to hear of Nguyen Ai Quoc . That is Ho Chi Minh 's real name . He once led a war where only one side showed up . What would you like to know ? About exploitation perhaps ? Perhaps representation ? " " Both , " Cherry said . El Paso 's voice in his ear was both soothingand interesting . Cherry flashed on Silvers each time the night became quiet and he longed to keep El Paso speaking . " Okay , Brother . Did you know Uncle Ho had many of his politicalenemies put to death while he was coming to power in the 1940s . He once said , ' All those who do not follow the line which I have laid down will be broken . ' In ' 45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dai Viet , and the Catholics and he directed the Viet Minh in the South . Diem was a popular nationalist back then . Uncle Ho tried to have him assassinated . He was n't successful but he was in having Ta Tu Thau rubbed out because Ta was head of a rival communist faction . The Viet Minh almost took over the South at that time but the British stopped them . " " The British ? " " Ah , you did n't know the British fucked around over here ? " " No . " " Oh yes , " El Paso said lazily . " Right after World War Two . TheJapanese had Nam during the war . The Germans had crushed theFrench in Europe and the French lost their colony here to the Japs . When the Japs were defeated Britain and America tried to force theVietnamese back into the French Empire . Boy Asshole did not haveit entirely wrong and , of course , Minh is very astute . Most of theBritish were from India and only led by Anglo officers . All thathappened while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the principles of equality and independencefor all pre-war colonies . The Anglos turned their backs onNam out of sympathy for the defeated French , and for money too . " " How come you did n't say that earlier tonight ? " Cherry asked . " Oh , you know , " El Paso shrugged . " No matter how hard youp375tell a man something he will not believe it unless he already believes it . Es verdad . Our first blunder here was to support the French . Roosevelt committed us to that . FDR not only condoned the French move but he sold them $160 million of war materiel . Truman kept it going . Eisenhower brought in the advisors , Kennedy the ground troops . The American public has always been one president behind . Johnson was not the one to begin the American combat role . He just escalated it . " " Wait a minute , " Cherry stopped him . " Did n't FDR die before World War Two was over ? " " Yes . But he made the commitment . Tricky Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , withdrawing everyone . People think we are still escalating . " " He 's an asshole . " " Yes . But they all are . Is there a politician anywhere you can trust ? " " I do n't know . Hey , what about Nixon 's Vietnamization and pacification and what about the Paris Peace Talks ? " " Those are very old programs . You should know the Vietnamese are very gentle and very polite and they love war . They must love war . They have been fighting non-stop for two thousand years . If you put two friendly papa-sans in a room for twenty-four hours , one will emerge victorious . " " Hey , that 's good . " Cherry laughed . " Ha . Put two ... " " Pacification , " El Paso continued gently , " is a French phrase going back to the late 1850s . The French wanted to mollify the natives , for humanity . ' They wanted the natives to be peaceful and to accept French rule . Dien Bien Phu showed what one hundred years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coined thatterm was stupid . It was an insult to all Vietnamese . " El Paso spat . Cherry could feel his body jerk as he spit . " We moved peasants off their rice farms and into camps on the coast . Then we keep the NVA from rocketing the camps . So what ? iEstupido ! Pacification is a term for newspapers and official reports . The only ' hearts and minds ' it wins are the ones making big profits off the war . " " God , Man ! You ought a talk to somebody . Maybe you should write the president . " " No one listens , Cherry . No matter how hard you tell a man something he will not believe it unless he is inclined to believe it . Pacification began as a protection for French missionaries . The emperor , Tu Duc , he was trying to keep western imperialism out of Nam and he blew away a few missionaries . Sometimes I think every man wants to get rid of a priest here or there . " One more parallel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British would n't have it ? That was the game of colonialization . It was like saying , ' So it do n't go communist . ' That 's a stupid reason . It is very much like it was before , only now we have some new names for it . " " Where 'd you learn all this , Man ? " Cherry asked . " It is all in the history books . I do n't have a monopoly on it . Do you want to know about negotiations ? " " I 'd very much like to hear . " . " It will be like it was before . The French ratified a treaty with Tu Duc in 1863 . In exchange for French backing the emperor gave the French Saigon . The people hated the French and they hated Tu Duc . Tu Duc wanted to slaughter the Catholics . The French said , okay , as long as we can have Saigon . The people went to guerrilla tactics to fight them both . To the people the treaty meant nothing . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South . The Vietnamese people were wild about losing Saigon by ' negotiation . ' One night , legend says , Tu Duc smelled an evil wind so he moved into league with Napoleon and renegotiated a return of Cochin China , the southern third of Nam . In return he opened the entire country to the French and he agreed to become a vassal and his country would become a French protectorate . The Vietnamese attacked Tu Duc and French trade went bad . The businessmen got pissed at Napoleon for not conquering and Napoleon reneged on the treaty . Treaties mean nothing . If we sign a treaty tomorrow that will not stop the war . " " Were the French that bad ? " Cherry asked . " Yes , " Egan said joining the conversation . He had sat up to check for leeches again . One was stuck to his right eyelid . He dug his fingers into his eyelid and squeezed . The leech burst and watery blood and slime ran down his face . " Fucken French starved the peasants , " Egan said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Goddamn fucken leech in my eye . " " Wake Doc up . " " Fuck it . Do n't mean nothin . " Doc had silently risen and was now on his knees by Egan gently checking Egan 's eye by touch . " Bloodsuckers , Mista . The whole world full of em . Get under yer poncho and let me look at that with a light . " " How 'd the French starve the peasants ? " Cherry asked . " They did stuff like force them to build railroads instead of lettin em raise rice . They died of famine because so many worked on the railroad and so few worked in the paddies . Twenty-five thousandstarved to death . "  | " Hey , " Egan said  --  he and Doc emerged from under the poncho  --  " let me ask , if you coulda come here back then and , say , killed the fucker who ran the railroad ... " " Doumer , " El Paso said . " Okay , " Egan said , " killed Doumer to keep those twenty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " No one answered . Egan pressed . " Huh ? Would that have been right ? The Jew use ta ask me that . He use ta say , would we have been justified in killing Hitler in ' 37 or ' 38 and thus stopping World War Two ? Stopping the slaughter of six million Jews ? Of twenty-five millionRussians ? Of maybe a total of fifty million people ? I did n't come here to kill . I came here to stop killing . So did you . How could anybody in good conscience refuse to come . It was people sticking their heads in the sand who let fifty million people be slaughtered in six years . El Paso , Doc , Jax , you awake ... " " I listenin . " " . . . Cherry , you came to save , not to destroy . Brothers , your hearts are pure . It 's the bloodsuckin politicians who 've fucked us . Me , you , all of us . " At the CP Brooks lay semi-conscious , cold , trembling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not enough to keep him warm . He trembled into that state between sleep and wakefulness where dreams flow and are sometimes controlled . He fell through a black hole into nothingness and the void filled with the gentle fragrance of Hawaiian flowers , bloomed with soft splashes of color , warmed with the touch of Lila . Those first moments repeated and sped by . If R &R's; beginning had been a wonder , the next days held no wonder at all . The tiny crack between Rufus and Lila spread gradually , steadily , a hundred minute inuendos forcing them apart until the invisible crack became a chasm . After they had loved for the nth time and he had lain back satisfied , warm and secure , Lila had said , " Oh Rufus . It 's going to be so wonderful . It is wonderful . " Rufus was anxious about seeing Lila again after so long but he had not expected her to be anxious too . He had simply not thought of it from her perspective . " Yes , it is wonderful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lila said . " Let 's not waste any time . Okay ? " " Okay , " he said smiling . She looked so pretty and so young . " We do n't have a lot of time , " Lila said . " There is n't going to be enough time to see all the things I want to see . I just know it . Let 's go eat then let 's go to the beach . Oh my , we 've been here almost six hours and we have n't even seen the beach . " Rufus had to shower first . He had washed beneath the coldp378showers at Eagle , then again in warm showers at Da Nang and at Ton Son Nhut but he still had not felt clean . He could not dislodge months of jungle dirt in minutes . of showers . Rufus showered with Lila . She got out and dressed . He continued washing . He scrubbed his feet for ten minutes and his balls for five . He scraped at his body with his fingernails removing layers of dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . We do n't have forever . Lila had dressed in colorful native African dress , her head wrapped in a high turban , her shoulders naked . She had accentuatedher green eyes with cobalt blue eyeshadow and raised the arch of the brows . She was stunning . Rufus just finished showering . " Oh Rufus , " she said , " do n't wear that uniform . " " I 'm not ashamed of it , " Rufus said simply , not defensively . " Oh , of course not , Silly . I only meant , well , you know , we 're here among civilians . " " Okay . " He smiled but it hurt him . A tiny chip had been made in the polished lacquer of his pride . " Come here , Silly . " Lila smiled warmly after he had dressed in the clothes she had bought for him . He obeyed and embraced her . Lila laughed and ran her fingers through his hair . She vigorously massaged his scalp . Why are you doing that ? Rufus asked himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it offend you ? Rufus and Lila dined at a very fancy restaurant on the first night of R &R,; the night of the day of their most wonderful love spree . Look at these rich sons of bitches in here picking at their food , Rufus said to himself disgustedly . God , even she 's doing it . Rufus did not mention his thoughts . His irritation and frustration grew . " I wonder what those guys are eating right now . " Rufus laughed as he plunged a thick juicy hunk of meat into his mouth and swallowed it after chewing only twice . " My fish is wonderful . " Lila smiled . " This sauce is just . . . just , scrumptious . How 's your steak ? " " Good . " He winked at her . " We call ourselves boonierats , " he said with pride . " What ? " She laughed at the name . " Boonierats , " he repeated and thought maybe that name does sound silly . " What 's a boonierat ? " she asked laughing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A grunt . " " A grunt ? " " Well , more than a grunt . Marines are grunts . Soldiers from thep379Big Red One are grunts . We 're boonierats . We live in the boonies , we do n't just visit . The jungle is our home . " " Let 's not talk about Vietnam , " Lila said . " Let 's talk about Hawaii and about you and me . " I 'm nothing right now but Vietnam , he thought . " All right , " Rufus said . " Hey , " he said cheerfully , loudly , " let 's order a bottle of champagne . I 'd love a fucking bottle of champagne . " The word fucking had come out so easily , so naturally , he had not even noticed it until he saw the appalled look on Lila 's face and the side-glance of the waiter . Well fuck them , he thought bitterly . After eating they took a taxi to a secluded beach . Three taxis had passed them up and finally the furious doorman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been crowded with bustlingpeople . Someone knocked into Rufus . He spun and violently shoved the man back , " Watch it , Mothafucka . " " Oh , so sorry , Sir , " an old oriental bowed slightly and scurried away . Other people on the sidewalk stared at him and Lila . Rufus breathed deeply . He could feel the ambient prejudice , the thick unwelcome Hawaii reserves for blacks . Or is it just that I 'm a soldier ? he asked himself . " God , " Lila seethed in the taxi . " Did you have to make a scene ? " " Aw fuck em , " Rufus snapped . " Fuck them phony people . They do n't even know what the fuck 's happening . " " Please do n't talk that way , Rufus , " Lila ordered . " These fucking people do n't even know there 's a war going on . Rich , innocent mothafuckas . " " Rufus ! " " Hey , you too . " They walked the beach in silence . The night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wade barefoot . Rufus wanted to return to their room and have room service bring up more champagne . Do n't let one bad pitch destroy your whole ballgame , he said to himself . " Look , " Rufus said stopping . " I 'm sorry . It takes some time to adjust to this . Hey , you know ? " " Rufus , I 'm sorry too , " Lila said . " I guess I have n't let you tell me much about what 's happened to you . " " Hey , okay . There 's not much to tell . I treat my men as my equals over there . They 're men . I 'm a man . I respect them for what they are and they return that respect . " Lila pressed the palm of her hand to her cheek and stood before him . " I 'm not sure I understand . " Rufus ran through explanations in his mind but he rejected each . He knew Lila was not interested in or capable of comprehendingwhat his infantry unit was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corps among his men built on the deep concern each had for every other . They worked together , they fought together , they shared life and death . How can those words mean anything to someone who has not experienced it ? Yet Rufus wanted to talk , wanted Lila to understand . But he could not talk . He put his arms out to her and drew her to him and they embraced . Lila kept her head buried in his chest . He did not belong to her any longer , nor did she any longer belong to him . They had come from different worlds , had merged , and had been separated by the army . They came together again in Hawaii and again they were from different worlds . They embraced a good-bye embrace . They both felt it but neither said it . That would take much longer . " Hey , let 's go back and get a few drinks at the hotel , " he suggested and she quietly agreed . Over the next few days Rufus and Lila went through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacation . They went to Diamond Head , to Pearl Harbor , to a hotel sponsored luau . They surfed , paddled an outrigger , played tennis . Rufus told Lila a little about his men , a little about tactics , a little about the gore of modern warfare . And they drank . Both drank heavily . Rufus passed out the next two nights . He could not relax . And in the morning , in bed , " How the hell can you say that ? " he demanded . " You stink . You never used to sweat like that , " she accused . " Hey , " he was furious . " Look ! Three things . One , men sweat . Okay , you 're a fine lady and you do n't sweat . Well , men sweat . Two , blacks sweat . Okay , you 're a fine black lady and you do n't sweat but blacks sweat . And three , black men sweat . Why do you think whites call us shines ? It 's because we sweat . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and I smell like a black man . I do n't know how you plug up your pores so effectively but I 'll tell you this  --  I ca n't do it . I wo n't do it . I 'm going to wet stink like the black man I am . " " Rufus , " she cooed . " White men sweat too . " He jumped out of bed and stamped off to the bath . During the days and nights , a dozen times , Rufus flashed upon evening operations on hillsides in Nam , on morning fights on ridges , on night probes in valleys . Again he tried to tell Lila about his men , about heroism he had witnessed , about hours he had endured . And again he felt her lack of interest , her apathy at best , her deliberate rejection , her distaste and hatred . Rufus attempted a different approach . Once he said , " Power is not simply what fire power you have . It 's not what you have . It 's what the enemy thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried another vein , something that should mean much to the artist in her black body . " There is a wholeness in black culture which has been disembodied in much ofp381white , especially Anglo-white , culture . The disembodying of the cultureis both the cause and the effect of perceptions which divide everything into components and then attempts to explain everythingas complex constructions of those components . When I say everything , I mean everything . I mean seeing a man as a composite of molecules and a poem as a composite of words or a culture as a composite of people and not seeing the energies which run through the forms , the molecules , the words , the people , the energy which ties the elements together into what the thing is . It 's that energy which our blackness is losing by becoming white . " She shook her head without hearing . He dove deeper . She stopped him . " Brooks , " Lila said , " you 're an ass . Ca n't you stop thinking of war and politics and race ? Ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she saw he was shaking . " Please be normal , " she said . " Please be here . Please , " Lila pleaded . She began to cry . " Be here with me . There 's a world here that is not just your words . " " I do n't understand you anymore , " he said . " What happened to that lady that I knew that really cared for us . That wanted so many things for us . The same things that I wanted for the two of us together . You used to believe in me . You did n't want to be only you . " " I still want those things , Rufus . It 's you who 's changed . I still want happiness and joy for us . I still want kids for us . I want to be much more than I am now for us . And I know it 's for us because I do n't care about any of that just for me . I want to share it with you . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like a total stranger . Brooks lay back thinking , dreaming . He watched that couple that he was certain he knew yet that he did not know at all . He watched them at night on the beach or in bed not touching . Brooks watched the woman talk to the man . She was very upset . " Love does n't have to hurt , " she cried . " Do n't you see ? Ca n't you see ? You do n't have to hurt me . I 'll love you without the hurt . Ca n't you see that , Rufus ? " Brooks rolled over and shivered against Brown . " It does n't have to hurt , " he muttered . Lila 's crying dried up and she turned hard . " Not tonight , " she said when they were in their room . " Hell , you 're so drunk , you could n't if I wanted you to . " Brooks sat up . His armpit was burning . He reached into his shirt and felt the leech and retched empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth . He swallowed . He wanted to chase all thoughts from his head . He needed sleep . Perhaps Thomaston was right , he told himself . Perhaps if he told the GreenMan he wanted out , wanted to DEROS and cancel his extension , perhaps hep384would be out of the boonies come next resupply . He could do that much for Thomaston . Let him have the company . Not for himself . Not for Lila . He was tired , so tired . So tense . Cahalan was asleep next to him . Brooks could feel his rhythmic breathing . On the other side Brown was awake with the radios , noiselessly adjusting the frequencies , monitoring other companies and Alpha 's platoons . Twice he called a security check to each LP , to each platoon CP . Twice each one responded with negative keying . I 've slept with these guys more than I have with my wife , Brooks thought . A pang of self-pity hit him . A single sharp arrow of pain driving down from between his eyes , down to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was as if he had been skewered with a giant fishhook . He clenched his fists and said to himself , " Anxiety must be converted to achievementnot to frustration or depression . " He said the words very formally , very evenly . " One must burn stress out of one 's system , " he continued . " Convert anxiety . Do not believe in failure . Analyze every situation to maximize the benefits and minimize the detriments . " Ah . It was working . He was successful in talking away the pain , the anxiety . Now , he said to himself , if only I could decide what to do .

Alpha was awakened by a horrible roar as if they lay beneath a speeding freight train , then a boom , then the explosion . Jax jolted up . It was still dark on the ground . The top of the grass was just distinguishablefrom the moist sky . **25;9168;TOOLONG split the air above him . " Motha ! They firin dat thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " Shee-it . " Jax lay back down and tried to sleep . Another round passed over . An eight-inch howitzer from Firebase Bastogne far to the south had begun the road mission . Alpha was on the GTL , gun-target line , a straight line from the gun to the target . They heard two explosions for each projectile , the small sonic boom of the shell traveling faster than the speed of sound , then the explosion of the round . As each round passed over Jax could feel his back trying to grab the ground , trying to mix his molecules with those of the dirt . The howitzer fired twelve rounds over a half-hour period and then ceased . Jax pulled his poncho and poncho liner tighter over his head . The drizzle became rain . Grayness penetrated into the grass . A single large drop of water worked its way under Jax ' poncho and onto the skin of his back . A chill ran up his neck and down his arms and legs to his fingers and toes . Quietly Jax rolled over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop squeezed past the poncho and fell into his ear . " Okay , okay , " he muttered . " I 's gettin up . " Jax threw off his poncho . His fatigues were soggy and his skin felt as gray as the sky . Jax removed packets of cocoa , sugar and cream , and a piece of C-4p386from his ruck . He grasped his canteen cup which had filled with clean rainwater during the night and put it on his C-rat can stove . He lit the C-4 , it flared white hot and died out . The water boiled . Jax mixed the packets and sipped the steaming brew . His breath formed a cloud before him as he blew the cocoa to cool it . Around him no one else was stirring . Jax scrounged in his ruck for a clean pair of socks and the foot powder Doc had given him . He sat down and removed his boots and socks . The skin of his feet was clammy gray and swollen . The constant moisture was causing the surface tissue to peel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Hello , feet . Remember me ? I 's the dude got yo dowin all the dancin . I jest want to let yo know Jax ree-lee , a-preciates the job yo of boys down der dowin fo me up here . Guess whut ? I brought yo somethin . Got yo dudes some powder an a pair a socks that like new .

Then we gowin clear this AO a leeches , then we gowin rest . " The fog cloak over the valley floor rose with the dawn . It now lay ten to twelve feet above Alpha . Visibility below the fog would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted it . Boonierats woke cautiously , quietly . Egan was up , sitting on his ruck , writing . Cherry was awake though he had not yet moved . He looked at Egan . Egan 's face was swollen and his right eye was swollen half-shut from the leech bite . Cherry lay motionless . It had not been a good night . He had lain awake long after the conversation had ceased and when he did finally sleep , he dreamed . Cherry had had first radio watch . During the watch he had thought about Silvers , about how he died . He analyzed every detail and he thought about alternative ways to carry his radio so it would not announce to snipers or trail watchers his important communicationfunction . During his vigil he did not close his eyes . He lay back . His body tense . It was as if all his nerves were one long thin filament stretched taut . And it was in motion , vibrating , like a piano wire . It was as if someone had started a wave action in the wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hit the end and bounded back through new waves zinging up . He had lain there jangled and taut , not in fear of death or of being hit , but in fear of not acting , not knowing how to act . His face burned as if all his energies were being forced into his head . Cherry reviewed everything he could recall about jungle warfare . He recalled basic training and AIT , RVN training and SERTS.  |p387There  had been night-fire classes , quick-fire drills , first aid and ambush classes . Cherry wanted to be good , had to be good , he decided , if he was to survive . In his mind he rehearsed what he should do if he were in column and they were ambushed from the left . He imagined his body reacting left . Then to the right . Front , rear . If someone near him were hit he placed himself mentally in the situation . Then he thought about calling in artillery support . He could do it  --  if he had to . Of that he was certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a situation happening and you think about the proper response , when it happens you will respond properly without having to think . What did Silvers do ? How does El Paso sound ? Egan . How does Egan move so quietly ? What does he do ? How does he look ? see ? smell ? feel ? Cherry tried to assimilate all their lessons . Then Cherry had passed the radio to Egan and had lain back and closed his eyes . A picture of Leon Silvers burned on his mind . Wrapped about Cherry , his water-soaked poncho liner became a blanket of sticky warm blood . He opened his eyes . He thought of turning to Egan , of offering to allow Egan to sleep while he took another watch . He decided against it . When the single shot felled Leon on the road Cherry had not jumped from the noise . His mind had been wandering and though the AK pop had startled him , it was the sight of others diving into the grass which brought the awareness of danger to him . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said to himself . Cherry quivered . His insides pounded hot , pulsed painfully . His brain ached . He could barely breathe . He forced himself to allow the nightmare to begin . He forced himself to observe his mind in terror . Half of him was on the enemy road . Everybody had scattered . Leon lay crumpled in a massive bloody heap at Cherry 's feet . The sweet smell of blood rushed to Cherry 's nose . The image was entirely still except for Cherry 's own motion as if Cherry stood in a color photograph . He screamed . " That bullet . That was mine . That was meant for me . For my neck . " From out of the trail , rising ghost-like from the earth , through the vehicle marred road , rose a figure . The figure wavered as though seen through heat . It was dressed in US jungle fatigues and it was soaked in blood . The image of Cherry 's body beneath its ruck shook . Its chest tightened as Cherry 's chest tightened on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the image to run . He realized he had control over it , could stop it now , whenever he wished . He watched his image watch the horror of the sordid scene on the road . In the photo Cherry froze now as the figure on the trail continued to rise and once at full height the rippling mirage solidified . It was that face again , a firm face , tight yellow-tan skin stretchedp388over delicate bones , deep brown eyes laughing . The figure took one step forward and the face burst in deep red gush splatter . Cherry laughed . The picture shifted . It came alive . The bloody Silvers at Cherry'sfeet became an angered , wounded , filthy rat clawing toward the grass shrieking and dragging its shattered gory abdomen . In the grass a hundred foul creatures scurried aimlessly in interlocking circles . Then the ghost figure before Cherry dropped . The head became a skull and glowed iridescent green . It approached . It came closer . It became larger and larger and winds swirled about the green glow until they whisked Cherry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . Cherry spun and fled and laughed madly . He ran with every atom of energy in his being . The glowing skull became larger . The frozen wind lashed at Cherry 's back . " You 're not God , " Cherry 's image teased , tormented the spirit . " You 're not God . You 're Satan . Fuck you . You ca n't touch me . I 'm God . " " Hey , " Egan woke Cherry . " What the fuck you laughing at ? " Cherry did not fall back to sleep or to dream . He thought about Leon . Had n't he and Leon exchanged addresses only a few days before ? Did n't Cherry agree to write to Leon 's sister and brother-inlaw ? Yes , now he recalled that clearly . How could he write ? What could he say ? He still did not know what he had done with the address . Tears welled up in Cherry 's eyes . He just got blown away . Just like that . Oh God , I can hardly believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very vulnerable . Them mothafuckers . Them mothafuckin dinks . I 'm goina kill every mothafuckingook slope I see . For you , Leon , you poor bastard . Cherry 's thoughts wandered aimlessly through the darkest night hours . He thought of Linda . He masturbated , quietly shooting his juices into the cold muck outside his poncho . He thought about food , about eating . Eating is a very social behavior , he said to himself as if he were reading a study for a psychology class . It 's very important to boonierats . It 's the only time we kinda socialize . It 's the only time we talk . Man , there ai nt no social life here in the boonies except that twice or three times a day when we eat . Cherry felt a flash of guilt from his first days in the army , from his very first KP . He had not yet even been assigned to a basic training brigade . He was in the transfer center at Ft . Dix . They had awakened him at 0330 that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pots and pans and washed the dining hall floor between meals and at four in the afternoon he and three other KPs were ordered to cut up carrots and celery for the evening soup . Tiredly they chopped and sliced , carelessly cutting the vegetables , dropping them on the floor ,  |p389ste|p|ping  on them , picking up squished pieces and dropping them into the giant pots , laughing and joking . Later he had been inserted into the serving line and he had ladled out the soup and had felt nauseous and guilty watching the other recruits and he felt even sicker when he thought about what others might do to the food he ate . Since that time he had always held a rigid standard about teamwork of army units , the communal eating , living , the communal everything , the total communistic society , the societal ideal so opposed by the military minds . And here in the army , he thought , who is the most vehement opposition to authoritarian communalism ? It is the same political left draftee who comes very close , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communal . Not militaristic but communal just the same , communal but for the strongest advocates who would replace the old order with the new , and who would be at the top of the new order . And who would be exempt from the common communallife which they see everyone else living happily . The Great White Father in Washington looking after his boys wherever they are , wherever he sends them . What wonderful control , what completeauthority . " Fuck it , " Cherry laughed . " Just say fuck it . Do n't mean nothin . Drive on . " It was now light . Cherry watched Egan writing for several more minutes , then he got up . He sat on his ruck and brushed his hands through his hair and pushed out pieces of vegetation . His scalp was crusted with sweat and dirt . He had never been so dirty . Cherry felt his forehead , his nose . They were covered with pimples . On his cheeks his beard was a splotchy stubble which itched . His arm sores had become worse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and oozed pus . His crotch rot was worse . The skin of his scrotum and inner thighs was red sore and white sore . Cherry watched Egan . They did not speak . Egan carefully put his writing tablet and pens in the waterproof can at the base of his ruck . He removed a razor and soap and toothpaste . Cherry watched Egan shave in a puddle , watched how attentive Egan was to his cleanliness , even in the boonies . Cherry decided to emulate the platoon sergeant . He washed . With the corner of his towel he scrubbed his face and torso . He borrowed Egan 's razor and shaved . He shaved in his own puddle , leaving on only the sprouts of a moustache . Cherry scrubbed his arms . The scabs broke and the soap stung in the open sores . He brushed his teeth . He tightened his boots . He repacked his ruck leaving out coffee , cocoa , pound cake and fruit cocktail for breakfast . Instead of repacking his toothbrush he placed it in his fatigue shirt pocket so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket flap . Egan kept his toothbrush in his shirt pocket like that . Cherry wanted to emulate everything . Now Cherry was eager to move out . He did not want to lie in the muck any longer . He fidgeted and adjusted his ruck straps again . He looked around . No one else was up . Cherry , you en your cherry ass , he assured himself , you 're getting it down . He decided to write a letter . He rose , then squatted by his ruck . He extracted a plastic bag containing pens and writing paper . The paper was damp . Cherry sat back on the ruck . I should write to Silvers ' sister , he thought . I should . Cherry stared at the black paper . He thumbed the edge of the page then began , " Dear Vic , " he wrote . I 'll write to the Silverses next , he told himself . " There must be few things in the world more boring than sitting with an infantry company when they have nothing to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Twelve hours of quiet and you 're bored . Somethingis fuckin with my mind . He began again . " Do n't believe anything you read in the papers about Nam . In twenty days I know more about this place than in four years of concern back in the World . " Cherry stopped again . Now how can I say that ? Before I knew exactly where the government stood and I knew just what was happening . Now I do n't have any idea what we 're doing and everythingthe government said seems either to mean nothing or to be a lie . He began a third time . " My mind came very close to total collapse these past few days . In five days in the field I have shot a man and I have seen my best friend killed . Yesterday I felt like vomiting . Today , immunity , sweet immunity is setting in and I 'm finally crawling out from under my shell as the apathy and insensitivitytake hold . " A slap jolted Cherry 's shoulder and he leaped , grabbed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 when Cherry jumped . Jax was in the grass between their rucks . " Rovers , " he whispered quickly to identify himself as a member of Alpha . " Doan shoot me Bros . It me , Jax . " He had a huge sheepish smile . " Oh fuckin Christ , " Egan sighed . " Cherry , you make me jumpy as shit . Jax , what you come sneakin up on us for ? " " Yo guys up , huh ? " " Yeah , " Egan hissed . " Marko on watch , " Jax explained as he wiggled his ass onto Cherry 's ruck and shared the seat . " I could not sleep , " Jax orated , his eyes twinkling . " I 's there all tucked up in my poncho an one big of drop a rain squeeze hisself inside with me en join me bout the neck . I get cold , Man . Chills run up my pretty black neck , down myp391pretty black back . My toes get colder en yesterday 's cow flop . " Jax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed and tapped his feet in the muck in which he had slept . Here was Jax , after their words of the past few days , back to his old style . Egan felt warmed by Jax ' gesture . " I looks up , " Jax continued . " An the sky comi.n almost light nough so yo know it there . I pulls my poncho over my head an rolls back over an tries to sleep again . Jest one minute , ' say 01 Mista Rain . I 's cold out here too . Yo let me come in there with yo an warm up . ' I says , ' Ai nt no way , Mista Rain . ' But he doan listen an he squeeze in again an this time he saunter his sillyass inta my ear . ' Okay , okay , ' I says . I gettin up . ' Then I peers out en see 01 Mista Rain , he ai nt cuttin nobody no slack . I get up . I says , body a Jackson , how yo this mornin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is faauuukkupp . ' So I says , ' Why doan we go up en see Eg en Cherry ? Yo know Eg ai nt never asleep . ' An sho nough , here 01 Jax right wid ya now . " Egan held his right fist out and Jackson met it lightly with his " Sky Devil Niner , Quiet Rover Four , " Brooks radioed Delta Company 's commander . At 1100 hours , after a lethargic morning , Alpha 's CP and 2d Plt began moving north in column back toward the road . 1st and 3d Pits had patrols reconning to the south , east and west . At the NDP the remaining boonierats continued silent restful guard . " Rover Four , this is Sky Devil , " the radio rasped in jocular reply . " Your wish is my command . Over . " " What the hell ? " Brooks muttered to El Paso . El Paso shrugged . " Devil , " Brooks transmitted , " my papa element is in your ballparksix zero zero mike to your sierra . We would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comic book to close in one hotel . Over . " " Roger dodger , Rover . Check it out . Rendezvous with Sky Devownright fist as they dapped . The two fists tapped knuckles-toknucklesand back-to-back . Open hands passed over each other in sensual caresses of brotherhood . Left hands came forward and touched and passed open over clasped rights and slid up right arms to shoulders then pulled across to the center of each man 's chest and clenched into fists . " I 'm glad you 're here , " Egan said . Cherry watched silently then got up suddenly , very quickly said , " Excuse me , " and rushed for the perimeter . A loose warm rush swept down into his bowels . He stopped , opened his pants , squatted . A watery brown gush : sloshed onto the jungle floor muck . Feces splashed onto his boots . " Oh God , no , " Cherry groaned . " Not the shits . "  |p392ils  echo tango alpha one hotel . My team is ready to play ball and wilco . Over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Out . " Delta Company had been moving back and forth on the north ridge for five days , being careful never to progress too far from their first secured LZ . Since daybreak they were to have been moving down the mountain toward the road and toward the rendezvous with Alpha . In reality only their CP had moved from a fixed positionDelta 's 3d Plt had established atop the ridge to a fixed position Delta 's 1st Pit had 400 meters down a rocky finger . Alpha 's rendezvouselement would do most of the humping . Brooks signaled with both hands , thumbs jerked outward . 2d Plt and the CP quietly spread out through the grass forming a long line . Again on signal they moved now sweeping forward , slowly , approaching to within two meters of the road . There they halted . They stood completely still for several minutes then one by one squatted or sat to observe . In the midday light and with the higher fog ceiling the corridor was yet more awesome . The surface was composed of rock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls signs of natural material marked junctions and turnaround points . One eight-inch round from the pre-dawn barragehad impacted directly on the road . The explosion had cratered the road surface and destroyed a thirty-foot section of roof . The crater had filled with water . There was no other evidence of damage from the artillery . Brooks radioed the TOC with a new road descriptionand the arty results . Then he cautiously moved forward . The flank gunners also moved to the road 's shoulder . They searched the far stretches . Through the hole blown in the roof Brooks could see a small cut in the cliff and a passageway up to Delta . He walked in the grass down the line , observing from various angles . At Alex Mohnsen 's squad Brooks stopped and stood still . The squad leader came to him . " L-T , " Mohnsen whispered , " we ai nt goina NDP with Delta , are we ? " Brooks did not look at him . " They 're the noisiest dudes in battalion , L-T . " " I know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north ridge wall . They were all silent again . They waited . The road remained empty . Halfway down the line Garbageman tapped one finger against his rifle in time with a silent song being played by a rock group in his head . Toward the far end , Hackworth muffled a cough in the crook of his arm , trapping the sound completely . He stifled the next urge to cough . And the next . Brooks stood rigid . Like everyone else 's , his uniform blended well with the grass . Mohnsen looked up at him several times . Brooks , motionless , was difficult to discern from evenp393this short an interval . " Patience , " Brooks muttered beneath his breath . He was very aware of the suppressed restlessness of his men . Still they waited and observed . After forty minutes Brooks moved . He returned to the CP . They rose . In both directions boonierats slowly stood , one by one . Brooks led off . He stepped from the concealment of the grass onto the road , crossed to the narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A stream fell through the cut . The water felt cold flowing in his boots . Behind the commander others crossed and climbed . Flank security remained out until almost the last man had crossed the road ; then the flanks collapsed , crossed and followed . When the entire rendezvous element was on the mountain slope , Brooks paused . He was winded . The passage was steep , the climb exhausting . Pop Randalph crawled past him to take point . Lt. De Barti moved to slack . 3d Sqd slid in behind , then the CP , 1st and 2d . They climbed in column north , then northeast , always up , always toward Delta . The vegetation on the north escarpment of the Khe Ta Laou was sparse and offered very little cover . Pop stayed low and stayed in gullies as he climbed . Behind him boonierats stepped into his footsteps . At just under fifty meters up the wall , Pop broke through the fog . High above the sky had a broken cloud cover . To the east there were patches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the west over the Laotian foothills , the horizon was heavy dark and foreboding . Pop continued up . He climbed for half an hour reaching an area where the land leveled and thick jungle congestion concealedtheir advance . " Tim , " Brooks whispered , " call Delta . See if they 've got us visual . " " Yes Sir , " Cahalan answered . The column continued . " Sky Devil , this is Quiet Rover , " Cahalan began . " We see ya , Good Buddy , " came the flippant reply . " Just yall stand right up and walk on in. 01 Delta got you covered . We 're just thirty mikes up the high feature . " Company D 's CP and 1st Plt were situated amongst a multipeakedrock outcropping that overlooked the valley on three sides . On the fourth , the finger ridge ran perpendicular up to the main north ridgeline . The outcropping looked like a bartizan battlement on a castle wall , the sheered off south face aiming directly toward the knoll at the center of the valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2d Plt boonierats stopped outside the perimeter . Brooks , his RTOs , FO and Doc Johnson entered the perimeter and walked silently toward the center . From all sides came jeers . " Man , look what just dragged in . " " Hey , Hardcore , do n't go givinp394the old man any ideas . " " Ai nt that them crazy fuckers from Alpha ? " " Break out the dew . Them dudes need a toke . " Brooks walked erect , eyes forward , oblivious to the Delta troops . FO followed the L-Ts example , as did El Paso and Doc . Brown nodded to several of the men he knew . Cahalan paused to talk to an old friend . At the center of the NDP Delta 's CP had erected a poncho hootch large enough for six men to sleep beneath . Throughout the outcropping ponchos were stretched over bootlaces to make pup tents , or tied to rock walls to form lean-tos . No one had made any attempt to camouflage the shelters . Under every shelter there were men sleeping or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " shouted Captain O'Hare from within the CP hootch . The Delta commander was a stout jovial man with a bushy moustache . His uniform was clean . His hands were clean . " Glad you could make it , " he called . " You 're just in time for coffee . " " Hello , Peter , " Brooks said formally , softly . He squatted outside the hootch and looked in . Delta 's commander and RTOs had been playing poker . " Come in , come in , " O'Hare persisted . " Sit down and grab a cup of coffee . Geez , this operation sure 's turned into a giant clusterfuck , huh ? Why do n't you have your men come in and join me and my boys ? Do you believe all this rain ? " " They 're okay where they are , " Brooks said coolly . " GreenMan give you anything for me ? " " I 'll say he did , " O'Hare said , " but first let me get you that coffee . " O'Hare rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hootch where a ten-cup pot was steaming . " All the comforts of home , " he chuckled as he poured rich black liquid into a canteen cup . " Here . " " Thanks , " Brooks said . He took the cup , sipped the coffee and passed it out to El Paso . O'Hare sighed . " Peter , I need all the bug juice you and your men can spare . My men are being eaten alive by the leeches in that valley . " " Yeah , I was surprised to find you guys crossed the river . " O'Hare avoided Brooks ' eyes . " How is it down there ? " " Peter , " Brooks said , " I need insect repellent and I want to know what the GreenMan said . " " Well , Ruf . Let me first say I 'm sure glad the old man did n't pick my company to go tricky-trottin down inta that . You guys just marched right through the middle of Gookville like you was comin down the middle a Main Street . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood and backed away from the hootch a few steps , hoping to draw O'Hare out . " Shit , L-T . Look at that , " El Pasop395whispered from behind him . Several Delta troops on the perimeter were smoking and passing their smoke back and forth . The butt popped sending sparks flying . The soldiers laughed . " Holy Mother of God , " El Paso whispered . " They 're blowin dew out here . " The personality of Delta Company was as different from Alpha as Brooks was from O'Hare . The companies were like brothers who had grown apart . On the surface Alpha was quiet , pensive , cautious yet daring . Delta was loud , boisterous , macho . In many ways Delta was a throwback to an earlier American personality in Vietnam which exuded bravado and faith in the American military way , while Alpha was the younger brother , taught tactics primarily by the NVA . Yet both companies came from the same parentage , the same battalion , division , country . The same technology was behind both , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptoms sent from a country turned sour on war and demanding the return of its soldiers . Oh God , Brooks thought . Just let up a little , just relax and let them relax , and this is what you 'll have . O'Hare came out from beneath the poncho roof . He had put on a rain jacket . " Did you hear , Bravo got another POW ? They got em an NVA honcho . " " When ? " Brooks asked . He stepped away from O'Hare coaxing the other commander into open neutral ground . " Earlier this morning . They killed another gook and got this honcho , and an AK and two RPGs . Can you believe it ? Taking a prisoner in this shit . " " Where 'd they get them ? " " Another bunker complex . Those bastards are dug in all over this valley . " " They were n't moving ? " " Nope . Not from what I monitored anyway . They said both gooks were clean and healthy . " Brooks signaled to Cahalan . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bravo 's action , " he whispered then walked off pulling O'Hare with him . Alpha 's CP contingent followed at a distance . " How much bug juice did your men come up with ? " Brooks asked O'Hare quietly . " I 'm sorry , Ruf , " O'Hare said sheepishly . " My boys do n't seem to be carrying much at all . I got three or four vials you can take . " " That 's it ? " " Yeah . Like I said , we were n't carrying much . If you 'd radioed earlier I could have asked the GreenMan to bring some out . He dropped in yesterday and talked to me for about thirty minutes . Then his bird came back and he left . Can you believe , flyin in weather like this ? Crazy , huh ? "  |p396Brooks  had continued walking while they talked . Now he was at the edge of the cliff overlooking the valley . O'Hare stopped a few feet back . FO , El Paso , Brown , Cahalan and Doc stopped fifteen feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and indeed no perimeterpositions along the cliff at all . Brooks seemed mesmerized by the view . He stared silently . O'Hare shuffled his feet . The valley was multiple shades of gray , the floor and Alpha 's lower element covered by a dirty thick gray fluff . Above was lighter gray , to the west very dark , the hills almost black , in the distant east unexpected patches of blue sparkling like jewels . " Every time I see that mother , " Brooks said nastily , nodding toward the lone tree protruding above the valley fog , " it gets bigger . That 's one colossal tree . Look at that thing . Look at the size of that . Peter "  --  Brooks turned to O'Hare then turned back  --  " how far do you think that tree is from here ? " " About a klick , " O'Hare said . " If you were up there you could see the whole valley , " Brooks said . " Ah , Ruf , " O'Hare stammered , " do you want to know about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turned again and leaned casually against a rock at the cliff edge . O'Hare began in alarm , " He wanted me to tell , ah , to offer you one of my platoons . " Brooks shifted . O'Hare stepped back another foot . " It 'll be op-conned to you while you 're down there . Ah , he , ah , thought you might need some more bodies . " Brooks set his gaze on O'Hare 's eyes . Even leaning Brooks was taller than the stocky commander . Brooks did not move a muscle , his breathing was imperceptible . That 's why I do n't DEROS , he thought . That 's why . My men might get stuck with a man like O'Hare . I would n't give any of them a fifty-fifty chance in the valley with O'Hare . " Peter , " Brooks said . " Yes , Rufus , " O'Hare jumped nervously . " Do you like small unit tactics ? Harassment and attack ? " " Huh ? Yeah . Of course . " " So do I. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up here  --  wo n't you  --  if we get in trouble ? " " Yeah , Ruf . You know you can count on us . " " You could probably be down to us in two or three hours if we were this side of the river . " " Yeah . I 'm sure we could . Ah , well . You know . It would depend . " " Let 's just leave it that way , " Brooks said gently . " Okay ? " O'Hare laughed . " That 's what GreenMan said you 'd do , " hep397said . " You know , Ruf , it 's good talking to you . You 're the only other commander I 've spoken with in the bush in I ca n't remember how long . We got to talk more often , ya know ? We got to stick together . " " Right on , Bro , " Brooks gave O'Hare a power salute . O'Hare nodded furiously . " Sometimes it gets lonely out here , being in command . It 's good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Captain , " Brooks let the disgust come through , " if you need understanding , look to your men . " Brooks rejoined his CP group and led them through the tiny hootch-city of Delta 's NDP . On their way out the calls came again , friendlier this time , " Go get em , Alpha . " " Do em a job , Man . " " Kick ass . Do n't take no names . " Outside the perimeter , regrouped with 2d Plt , Brooks relaxed . He turned to FO , pointed and asked , " Bill , how far is that tree from here ? " FO glanced to the valley center . " Fourteen hundred meters , " he said . " Maybe fourteen fifty . " Brooks nodded . " We 're going to circle that mother , " he said . " I want to go clear around it before we hit it . " The men around him nodded agreement . They began the descent . Halfway down to the road the fog enveloped them . They paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you ever get a commander like O'Hare , waste him . " At the road an eerie feeling swept through the rendezvous element . No one said a word . They crossed quickly and blended into the elephant grass . The crater which the eight-incher had blown in the road had been drained and partially filled . The hole that had been blasted in the roof was already less than half the size it had been when Alpha had crossed to climb to Delta . No one was around . At dusk , forty minutes after 2d Plt and the CP reunited with Alpha , Alpha moved out . They moved in column , generally east , staving on the valley floor between the road and the river . 1st Plt humped between 3d at point and 2d at drag . Cherry quietly followedEgan . He was weary . Other than the few words with Jax and Egan at dawn Cherry had not spoken to anyone in twenty hours . When 2d Plt left for Delta , Cherry had manned 1st Plt 's CP alone . Egan had gone out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company CP had been , McCarthy went with Hoover . Late in the afternoon Cherry had broken squelch on his radio and whispered , " Sit-rep negative , " in response to a call from El Paso . At that point he had realized those were the first sounds he had made in nine hours though he had been carrying on conversa/tions in his imagination with himself , with his brother and with Egan . When Egan returned he had immediately waved Cherry into silence , pointed a finger in the air and circled . We 're surrounded , Cherry speculated . He began to indicate his puzzlement when the rush hit his bowels again and he sprinted for the perimeter . It was his seventh trip since daybreak . While Cherry squatted , Whiteboy went running by , his pants half down , his hand on his penis . Doc McCarthy was chasing him with at least three cigarettes burning . Behind McCarthy , Hill , Harleyand Andrews were all giggling , trying to keep silent , trying to keep up with the medic . Whiteboy circled back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A'mighty . Whut am Ah gon na do ? " Whiteboy whispered . He was still holding his penis . " Shoot it with Little Boy , " Harley laughed staring at Whiteboy 's groin . " Here , Whiteboy , " McCarthy whispered catching up . He held up the cigarettes . " I 'll get rid of it for ya . " And the medic descended upon Whiteboy who let him get to within a foot then jumped back . " Ah got to figger , " Whiteboy said . He half giggled at McCarthy approaching like that but he was obviously afraid and in pain . Cherry pulled up his own pants and approached . He looked at everyone 's object of concern . Hanging out of Whiteboy 's urethra was the tail end of a leech . " Come on , " McCarthy chuckled . " I wo n't burn off more than an inch . You got plenty to spare and you ai nt usin that thing here , anyhow . " Egan appeared , as always , seemingly out of nowhere . He immediatelyperceived the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small bottle of bug repellent . Without a word he walked to Whiteboy , removed the bottle top and dropped half a dozen drops on the leech . It squirmed and began to withdraw . Egan squeezed several more drops on . " Hold still , " he ordered . Whiteboy was nearly in tears of joy . " More , Eg , " he pleaded . Egan squeezed another drop . The leech seemed to back out further . " Whut are you , Eg ? A junkie ? More . Please . " Egan squeezed , another drop fell then the bottle deflated empty . Egan tossed it over his shoulder and smiled , shrugged and left . The others stood silently around staring at Whiteboy and the leech , stifling their laughs . Cherry ran back to his perimeter spot , pulled his pants down and squatted . Then he snapped upward and looked back for leeches . Alpha forded several wide though shallow streams on the move east . They crossed all without ropes . Each time they crossed they proceeded in similar manner to the crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before entering the open space . Each time Brooks felt the maneuver went smoother and quicker . With each stream crossing the vegetation changed . Alpha left the brutal elephant grass for the congestion of bamboo and then for a scary sparse low brush and sand meadow . The valley floor here was a series of rolling swells . " Hold them up , " Brooks told El Paso when the CP reached the meadow edge . " Who 's at point ? " " 3d Sqd , 3d Pit , " El Paso answered . He radioed the halt forward . That dumb son of a bitch Caldwell , Brooks thought . He pulled out his topo map , made note of the location 's coordinates , looked up and ordered a slow withdrawal from the sparsely vegetated area . 3d Ph withdrew and the point headed south then east again skirting the meadow . Half a kilometer beyond the meadow , the point called a halt . " What do they have ? " Brooks asked El Paso . " Cornfield , " El Paso said . The CP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall cornstalks in a well-cultivated field . Silently Brooks directed elements to flank the field . The column advanced from behind filling the voids created by the circling troops . Almost immediately 3d Pit found the field 's parameters . It was barely six meters wide and thirty meters long . Brooks led a sweep up the center . El Paso picked an car of corn . He peeled back the husk . The kernels looked ripe and juicy . He cautiously licked the ear . No taste . He took a small bite . Sweet . He picked another ear and gave it to the L-T . Taste it , he signaled . Brooks did . Doc watched , picked , tasted , then picked several . Soon every man on the center sweep was harvesting the corn . Pick it but keep moving , Brooks signaled . Alpha left the cornfield , reformed in column and climbed up and over the next swell east . Brooks called a halt . Brown and FO worked their way to the back of the unit and into a position to observe the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FO whispered into the handset . The radio responded . To FO the handset felt alive . His words spoken into the small plastic and metal apparatus set the FDC and the gun bunnies scurrying . He was the eyes of the artillery unit . " Rover Four , Two . Stand by for shot , " the radio rasped . " Roger Two , " FO radioed . To Brown he said , " Pass the word , stand by for shot . " " Shot out , " the radio sounded . " Shot out , " FO repeated . Then he counted to himself , " . . . one thousand five , one thousand six ... " Twenty meters above the valley floor a white cloud popped into existence . It was fifty metersp400right of the field . " Left fifty , " FO called . " Fire for effect . " Three HE rounds impacted across the near end of the field . Then three more . " Oh , oh . Boys , yo on the money , " FO cheered the arty unit via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FO 's command , even so near , sounded friendly . Up and down the line boonierats felt warmed by the violent eruptions . " Add fifty , " FO called . The field was progressively decimated . Half of Alpha 's boonierats crunched joyously into the sweet raw corn . The rain became heavier as darkness closed about Alpha and the fog again descended to ground level . The unit moved cautiously through high discontinuous brush , moved generally eastward , the land slowly rising , the vegetation slowly thickening . When it was very dark the unit stopped , the column shortened and widened , the boonierats sat , covered themselves with poncho and poncho liner , ate , and set up LPs and guard watches . The CP meeting was concise and only Thomaston and Caldwell and the CP group attended . Cahalan 's report was also short . Bravo and Recon had both made contact , both in bunker complexes , both at the eastern edge of the valley . Bravo 's contact had taken forty minutes . They killed one NVA and captured one who wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute . They also killed one NVA and captured one . Recon 's prisoner was half-dead , blown to pieces . Both prisoners were evacuated by medical helicopters . Except for Delta , all the other SKYHAWK companies were tightening their grip around the Khe Ta Laou . The gaps between the units were receiving continuousartillery H &; I fire and constant high level electronic and infrared surveillance . There was no evidence of major enemy movementsinto or out of the Khe Ta Laou and intelligence teams suspectedthey had overrated the valley 's significance . Cahalan 's report was followed by a brief discussion . Then Brooks said , " Tomorrow , we cross the river and check out the south bank . " The meeting ended . It was early , dark , quiet and cool . The night promised to drag by slowly . Half of Alpha slept , the other half fidgeted . Brooks too was uncomfortable . At 2300 hours he radioed 2d Plt and requested Pop Randalph to bring six volunteers to the CP . Ten minutes later Pop crawled into the CP circle followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes Sir , " Pop reported. " 3d 's got an LP due east fifty meters , " Brooks said to the assembledteam . " I want you to go out to them , leave them there , move 150 meters farther east and set up an ambush site . " " Aye aye , Sir , " Pop said . " I know just the spot . " Brooks whispered a few questions checking out the team . Hep401had Ezra Jones , Mohnsen 's RTO , contact the LP and inform them of the move . " Plenty of time , Pop , " Brooks patted the old boonierat on the shoulder . " Take your time . " The team departed but still Brooks felt uneasy . He lay back and tried to sleep . El Paso was on radio watch . Cahalan was breathing easily . Minh and Doc were whispering a few feet away . Brooks crawled to them . Then Egan showed up . Then Jax . Then Cherry . The men formed a tight cluster . The discussion began almost as if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who was the first American to die for freedom ? " Doc asked . " You mean here ? " Cherry asked . " I mean ever , Mista . I mean the very first . " " Who ? " " Crispus Attucks , " Doc said proudly . " Killed in the Boston Massacrein 1770 . That man wo n't even free yet he died so your greatgrandpappycould own mine . That man was a black slave . " " Right on , " Jax laughed . " A black begun the first revolution an it was over blacks the second was fought . Now this black gowin begin the third . Let whitey eat my turd . " " Oh , eat my asshole , " Egan snapped . " The revolution is at hand , " Jax giggled . He was having a good time . " Come wid me , Bro , join our band . A new gov'ment we 'll give the land . " " Look around , Man , " Egan said . " Is this what you want ta do hack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back there ? " " How are you going to overthrow the government ? " Cherry asked seriously . " We shall unite the people , " Jax said . " People of the world unite ! Fight imperialist dogs ! Stand up , be courageous ! Advance ! Wave upon wave of my people will descend upon the filthy butchers . We gowin form a platoon . " " If one shot is fired , " Egan took Jax ' bait , " your revolution 'll create a monster . " Jax just laughed . " You mothafucker , " Egan laughed back bitterly . " You mothakickerstalkin revolution . You just want to steal what other men created . Color only gives you an excuse . " " They been doin it to us forever , " Doc said . " There ai nt no I3ruthers doin it out here . We all pullin our weight . " Jax reached out and grabbed Cherry 's arm . " Bro , why doan you join us ? Yo get back Jax gowin need a good RTO . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answering . " You 're just tryin ta get over , " Egan sighed  | " Like au yo white granddaddies did on mine , " Jax said . " Not mine , Man , " Cherry said . " All the whites did , " Doc said . " Fuck that , " Cherry whispered firmly . " My ancestors were serfs in Italy while yours were slaves here . Hey , Man , my grandparents came to this country in 1896 and at that time most of the Italians lived in crowded city tenements and worked in mills . Back then only twenty percent of all Americans lived in cities . My people were trapped there just like yours . But they did n't go cryin to the government , bus my kids to the WASP countryside . ' " " Course not , Bro , " Jax laughed . " They wo n't no buses in 1896 . Yo 'd have ta a walked , " " Ha , " Cherry huffed . " But my people did n't stay there either . " " Right on Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That jest what I 's sayin . We doan condone the pigs . Ef yo dowin whut they wantin yo ta do , yo helpin ta perpetuate their system . The revolution is at hand . Join us . " " People are dumb , " Egan injected . " They 're dumb and they 're apathetic and they like to be used . They do n't like to make decisions or to be responsible . Even for themselves . They want to be led . They want to be exploited . " " Do you really think so ? " Brooks asked softly . He was enjoying the conversation , and now too , the night . Egan looked through the blackness toward Brooks . He was aware of the L-T 's debating skills and he proceeded cautiously . He had already committed himself . " Yes , I do . Look around . You have to beg people to be platoon sergeants , even . There 's a dozen guys in 1st qualified to be platoon sergeant who are satisfied sitting back puttinin their time . " " Jax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mist . " Why do you think the people allowed themselves to be exploited by a . . . an elite ? " " That whut I 's sayin , L-T . We doan condone it no mo . " " But blacks did before ? " " They had to . " " Could it be as Danny said . They were too lazy or simply did not care ? " " Lazy and shiftless , L-T ? " Doc whispered nastily . " What do you think , Minh ? Your country was exploited for a very long time . Could the people secretly have wished to be membersof the elite and thus wanted it to remain ? " " Oh no , L-T , " Minh 's whisper was high and thin . " I do not think this is so . But it may be so . To have an elite you must have thep403masses , yes ? Perhaps they are a unity . Perhaps one can not be eliminated without eliminating both . And then who remains ? " " Huh ? " Cherry uttered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe we should think about that . Perhaps many blacks in the World no longer want to be used . Perhaps they now refuse to condone being automatically relegated to society 's lowest levels . But they 're not , no matter what they say , on the road to destroying the country . Perhaps they are securing the perpetuation of the system by fighting to be the elite . Perhaps they are out to build a better country . " " Like they built a better Watts ? " Egan suggested sarcastically . " Or maybe a better Detroit ? By rioting and burning the place down ? By forming guerrilla platoons , secret armies , to overthrow the government ? " " Guerrilla groups doan just happen , Mista , " Doc said . " Riots Joan just happen . You know that . They produced . They produced in I a kind a society where there 's hopelessness . " Doc paused . He flashed on hot summers in Harlem , heat wave days when the TV crews showed up to film eggs frying on car hoods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrants . It always looked like so much fun . Like an amusement park . Inside the tenements , unfilmed , men lay sprawled , near naked , gasping for breath . Only the putrid air seemed more listless than the jobless old women who sat unable to move . Very old people died in their rooms unnoticed until evening when they were carried out . The evening brought little relief from the heat . Doc remembered the summer when Marlena , a tiny child , was nearly killed by roof rats in her makeshift bed . For a month the wounds on her legs seeped . Doc cleared his throat . The others were silent . " Riots down just happen , " he repeated sadly . " They come hum despair , Mista . You know what I mean ? They doan come from repression . They come from crushed expectations . It ai nt far from hopelessness to riots . " " Doc , I do n't understand . I do n't see things as hopeless , " Cherry said easily , trying to sound sympathetic yet encouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought up that way , Mista . You see people makin it . Where I come from , I see people wastin way . Hopeless , Man . You can say what you want but nobody listens . Like you . You ca n't hear me . They pass laws , they say they spendin money . Nothin happen . . fax right , Bros . The government gon na fall . It 's the government who decide who live , who die . The government decide who drafted , who shipped to Nam , who a boonierat , who get jobs , who starve . " " It 's not that way for everyone , " Cherry said . " The revolution is comin , " Doc said very sadly . " It comin an thep404government ca n't stop it . They ca n't stop it cause the guerrilla is the heart of the people . The heart of the people that the government discards . " " Maybe you dudes are right , " Egan said . This time he had really listened . What was being said went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny it . " It 's right to say the government 's in control . They got the guns . All political legitimacy comes out of the barrel of a gun . All human rights , speech rights , property rights . If you really do n't have them maybe you do have to revolt . I take back a lot of what I said . If the government tries to take your freedoms you got to revolt . That 's power out of the barrel of a gun . Americans have traditionally had a low flash point . That 's why we know such great freedoms . And you 're right . We are losin it . We 're losin it little by little to the Nixon machine and to the bureaucratic machine . But you know somethin ? We 're askin to lose it . We 're sellin our freedomsone by one to that bastard . We 're sellin it to be taken care of by a paternalistic government . And that 's cause people are lazy and they do n't care . Yeah . If you got ta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , Bro , " Jax whispered . After a pause Brooks said , " It is important for us to understand how racial violence occurs if it is to be avoided in the future . Doc , you said something just now that really hit me . Race riots do n't just happen . Wars do not just happen . Would you do me a favor and ponder that ? I want to talk some more , but later . " The little group broke up and the men returned to their positions . Brooks went to his ruck and silently removed a stenographer 's pad from the waterproof ammo can at its base . The time had come . He would write down his observations and thoughts about conflict . In the dark he wrote carefully , large and cryptic . On the cover he printed , AN INQUIRY INTO PERSONAL , RACIAL AND INTERNATIONALCONFLICT . On the first page he wrote : Conflict does not just happen . Wars do not just happen . Divorce does not just happen . Then he put the notebook away . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must write my dissertation . I 'll radio GreenMan in the morning . Should I tell anyone else ? Why do I always come out sounding like a bigot ? Egan asked himself . He and Cherry were back amongst 1st Pit . Egan mulled over the argument with Jackson and reviewed the other conversationat the CP . He did not , could not , believe he was a racist . He would not even describe himself as right wing . He believed he was very open minded , very much a man who weighs all sides of an argument . Cherry 's whisper disrupted his thoughts . " What ? " he said.  | " How do you think Jax and Doc and the L-T feel about you comin down on blacks ? " Cherry repeated . Holy Shit , Egan thought . Was I that bad ? Egan spoke softly in that jungle-night voice developed in veteran boonierats , a firm voice with almost no sound . " Boonierats is a race , " he said . " We can say things like that . Nobody takes it personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jew ? " " You do n't understand yet , " Egan said . " Takin it personal is for people back in the World . We got a separate culture out here . And in some respects it 's better . Fuck Man , an AK round do n't care what color your paint job is . " Cherry took a deep breath and exhaled slowly . " You got no feelings , Eg , " he said . It was the very first time Cherry had ever used the nickname . He felt slightly apprehensive yet it brought him to Egan 's plane . " You do n't understand , Man , " Egan said . " You 're goina have to experience it all for yourself first . I got feelings . " " Goddamnit , " Cherry grunted . " I do n't understand you . I think you just hide in that hardass role you 're always playin . " " What ? " " Silvers gets blown away . Brunak gets wounded . You either do n't care or you hide it awfully well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Silvers got blown away . I 'll never see him again . He 's dead , Man . " " What difference does that make to you ? Or to me ? " Egan was feeling quite heated . " He 's dead . You want me to write his folks and say , ' Ah , I knew yer kid . He did n't die bad . There was n't time for pain cause he caught it in the neck . ' Maybe you 'd have me go easy . Say , ' fie got it fuckin a sleeze in the ville at the height of orgasm . ' What the fuck do you want from me , Man ? " " Nothin , " Cherry said . Their conversation was n't going as he had expected . " Look , Cherry , " Egan calmed . " If I 'm goina mourn for a dude , I got ta do it in my way , in my time . Man , boonierats are different kinds of people . You want to think about Silvers , think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got ta think about what to do . I had to replace him , make Jax squad leader . That was n't easy . Marko and Denhardt both could a been made squad leader . " " You did n't do that cause Jax is black , did you ? " " Fuck no . Denhardt 's got no brains at all and Marko could n't lead his grandmother through a supermarket without antagonizing her . I mean it when I say boonierats is a race . Look , I love these guys out here . I know I can depend on em . "  |p406Cherry  did not answer . " One night on 882 we had twenty-eight , wounded , " Egan said . " Everybody seemed to be bleedin . Black , white , yellow . None of the docs said , ' Go find a medic yer own color . I only treat my kind . ' The docs treat everybody . Pointmen lead everybody . When some of those dudes died everybody felt bad . Jax felt for his white boonierat brothers just like I felt for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I hate to see fucken blacks riot in the World . Fuck it . I do n't think it 's s'pose to show . " Cherry and Egan lay back . Cherry was on radio watch . Egan passed quickly from awake to semi-consciousness . His mind zigged and zagged in agitation . Stephanie appeared and calmed him . He watched her form , the image solidify . The sun came out . It was spring and warm and the air was sweet with the smell of fresh cut grass . How had he ever let her slip away ? Perhaps he had n't . Perhapsshe would be there when he returned . The closer he came to his DEROS and ETS the more he thought of her . Daniel Egan visited Stephanie often during the summer of her divorce and through the following autumn and winter . His memory exploded with small anecdotes of those days . His entire body burned with desire for her . The soft sleepy neck of Stephanie rose from a woeful droop and swung back tossing her hair in a gleeful , careless arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughter . Come , her image beckoned to him . Come with me . On the jungle floor Egan 's body quivered in resistance . Come , she beckoned . His body shook . He felt at peace . Smoothly , silently , pleasantly , his spirit slipped from his body and joined Stephanie in the image in his mind . For a moment Daniel glanced back at the soldierly figure , the cold filthy miserable body crumpled on a hundred-pound pack , then the spirit turned its back and smiled at Stephanie . They strolled in a glistening world by a small stream . Before them a stone bridge arched . They walked to it and crossed and walked on to a pond . The day was warm . Fat-leafed maples reflected in the water . Daniel broke pieces of bread from a loaf he was carrying and tossed the pieces to the ducks swimming nearby . The colorful birds paddled closer , a few even came out of the water to feed near their feet . The ducks fought one another aggressively yet they remained timid and watchful as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the water 's edge and the ducks came to her and took the bread from her hand . She sat back and the ducks stretched their necks across her lap . She stroked them tenderly and they ate . Daniel inched nearer to pet one . They all scattered . We 're all like that , hep407had thought . Anyone can come to her without fear , yet she herself is so timid . She 's so strong yet so timid . " Do you remember the book you left me in New York ? " she asked . " Yes , " he said lying back . " When you came back I told you I had n't read it . " " I remember . " " You said , I knew you would n't . ' " " I did n't say that , did I ? " " Um-hum , you did . If you bring me The Sun Also Rises , I promiseI 'll read it . I started Hawaii two weeks ago . " " How do you like it ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed , " but I must admit big books kind of scare me . " The image flowed . The physical being on the jungle valley floor pushed it , trying to force it , to speed it up as if time were running out and the body wished to relive as many episodes as possible . " I received your book today , " Stephanie 's voice came to Daniel over the phone . He was back at school . He had sent her his battered copy of The Sun Also Rises . " It 's a beautiful book , " she said . " I have n't started it yet but I like to touch it and to look at it . It 's beautiful . " I 'm sending you my Sandy Bull album , Fantasia . I think it 's more me than any others I have or anything else I have , except my eves . Which I ca n't give you though I 'd like to . " Stephanie laughed gleefully for a time and Daniel laughed though no sound came from him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " You 've probably read it but if not I 'll send it to you . I really like it and Howard Roark reminds me of you . How is the Alaska house coming ? Please do n't forget how much I want to see your drawings . " On some plane in between , Daniel Egan was aware he never showed Stephanie the Alaska house drawings . Now , in another image , ' she let him have it . They were in a small upstate bar , Stephanie was sad and serious and so delightful . " I told myself I was n't going to do this but I am . You know , Daniel , in some ways you 're very selfish . I know you know it . Talk to me , Daniel . I know it 's there but you wo n't give it to me . I love you and hate you for doing it . " Daniel , " she pleaded , " I want , and I am trying , to come to your level . Oh , that sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I 'm getting it . But Christ , Daniel , will you talk to me ? Are you doing it purposely ? I bet you are . I can meet you there . TALK TO ME ? ! You bastard . You beautiful bastard . " " Stephanie , " Daniel answered her now an answer he had never given . " I care . I care for you more than for anything else I 've ever known . I just do n't know how to say it . "  |p408His  thoughts sped on . Stephanie , I 'm striving to gain your level , the level of natural humanity uncluttered with mass produced technology , I care for you . . . i care . . . i love . . . I love you . " I 've been volunteering at the daycare center . " Stephanie smiled . They were lying together . The day had been exquisite and the night was warm . Stephanie was happy and sorrowful and troubled . " I 've been working in a room with eleven children , seven of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all I had to do was smile and there were six children hanging around my neck and on my legs . They seemed so starved for affection . This one little boy named Jeremiah is one of my favorites . Daniel , he is just darling . I want to adopt him . His mom is on relief and she 's an alcoholic . Jeremiah comes to the center with no underwear , pants five sizes to big with the zipper broken and the pants pinned to his shirt so they wo n't fall down . I went to a rummage sale and bought him underwear and shirts and sent them home with him . The next day his mom sent a note with him saying she did n't mind Jeremiah coming to the center but she did not approve of us trying to buy his love with clothes . Wow , Daniel , I was really hurt . I guess I 've got a lot to learn . " Oh , Daniel , there are some sad moments but mostly we really have fun . I could go on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish you could see them . You 'd love them too . " Daniel sat and listened and loved her for being so enthusiastic and so sensitive and for loving the children . But he said nothing except to ask her if she 'd given up art completely . She responded in a way he never understood . " Daniel , no one will ever really know , will they ? No one will ever know what 's inside you . They can get an idea but they 'll never really know . That makes me sad . " " I 've always believed , " Daniel 's image sounded very far off , " that a person is what he does . A person is what he accomplishes , what he creates . An artist , for example , is a person who creates art . It 's not one who fosters the image to others that he creates art when in fact he creates nothing . That 's a pseudo-artist . A person who takes care of children is a child care specialist . That 's who they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do then identity crises are caused by not knowing what to do or by not doing . An identity must be constructed by doing , creating , building ... " " How about by reading and thinking and dreaming ? " He heard her say that now . He saw the hurt on her face now . Why would n't I allow myself to hear her ? he asked now . I was a bastard . Again , tumbling through weightless voids and into another scene . His body no longer wanted to push the fantasy . He no longer wished to re-experience all their times yet he was out of control . The picturep409flowed at its own speed , its own discretion , on its own energy . It was the same scene he had remembered the day of the CA but this time it was clearer and their positions were reversed . They were in a room in the old Martinson Hotel which looked out across the railroad tracks to a dully lit cobblestone street . It was raining . Daniel was standing by the only window in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , across the street , reflected mud-ash earth and debris . On the corner up the street a tavern sign flashed Iron-City Beer  --  On Tap . The window sill and frame of the hotel room were partially lighted from the light of the street . The room was dark with the exception of a single candle burning in the corner . Stephanie lay in the bed looking at Daniel 's back . The room was old and dingy . Stephanie rose , circled the bed and put her arms around Daniel 's shoulders . She lay her cheek against his back . Daniel turned and she let go . She was still naked . She stretched her hands gracefully toward him , he took them softly and held them then brought her to him . " I 'm sorry , Steph , " he said . " I did n't understand . " It was his spirit speaking . It was not his image . He had hurt her while they made love . During his campus exploits he had developed a harsh dominant athletic style which did not suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left scar tissue at her cervix which caused her pain on deep thrusts . " I 'm sorry , " Egan 's spirit said . " I 'm sorry for all of this . Someday , I 'll make it up to you . " After that time he did not see Stephanie for many months . Now watching the lone mirage he thought how insensitive he was to all the things Stephanie said . That is the tragedy of his life . He was not sensitive to Stephanie when it had been possible . He had not even been sensitive to his own feelings . The hallucination rolled and shook violently . He was above his own body , his cold wet sleeping body wrapped in poncho and poncho liner . Squatting beside him was the sapper . The enemy smiled  --  his teeth glistened . I 've got you this time , the soldier seemed to say to the hovering spirit . Slowly he machete lifted . In slow motion the dark foe whipped the silver blade in a circle then powerfully brought the blade down toward Egan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the spirit cried . " I 've got to get hack into my body . I 've got to help him . " The spirit was frantic , the body on the ruck cowed , the enemy blade descended in slow motion . He razor sharp edge pierced the bridge of Egan 's nose . Slowly the blade , driven by the might of the enemy 's powerful hand , cleaved Hilo h , gan 's eyes dividing the orbs . The spirit slipped back into Egan ph vsically expanding his cringing viscera . A series of small explosionsshook his ears . Then an M-60 opened up far to the north.  | " What 's that , " Cherry whispered . Egan grabbed his face . He was silently crying . In the dark , in the rain , two NVA sapper teams noiselessly crawled up the cliffs of the north escarpment to the rock outcroppingwhich held Delta 's NDP . Below , half of Alpha was asleep , half was on vigilant watch . Egan was in the midst of dream . The sappers slid silently to the perimeter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NVA had been watching the Americans from above . Delta barely altered their alignment from the moment they set up and they quickly established a routine movement pattern . The sapper unit studied Delta 's fighting positions , the positioning of the poncho hootches and the behavior habits of Delta 's troops . They carefully conceived and detailed their attack . At dusk they began to execute the plan . The two teams climbed straight up the cliff , one settled among the rocks at the cliff edge , the other veered and followed the path which Alpha 's rendezvous element had used during the afternoon . For three hours the sapper teams motionlessly watched as Delta troops fidgeted and fussed and divulged their positions . Then the team at the cliff edge penetrated the perimeter . The sapper team leader found two Delta soldiers asleep with their M-60 machine gun on bi-pod between them . Noiselessly the sapper thrust a thin-bladed bayonet into the first soldier 's throat . He drove the blade upward toward the back of the head , twisted and withdrew . The body twitched then relaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sapper cautiously circled the dead man . The second guard awoke , startled . He tried to sit up to scream . The sapper smashed stiff fingers into his Adam 's apple knocking the man back , stifling his scream . Then , quickly , he bayoneted the man 's throat . The team infiltrated the NDP , worked to predetermined points among the rocks and brush and became rigid . At Delta 's CP two men were smoking . The second sapper team remained outside the perimeter . Slowly , soundlessly , they crawled about Delta 's claymore mines . As they found each one , they turned it around and aimed it in upon the defenders . Then they all lay quietly . After a pause of fifteen minutes the outside sapper team again began to move . They made a little noise . Delta did not react . The sappers moved again making more noise . " Sir , " a Delta perimeter guard came to the CP . " I think we got movement inside the claymores . " " You see anything ? " O'Hare asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Whatcha got , Bobby ? " an RTO asked  | " I ai nt sure . Bat Man thought he heard somethin . " " Throw a frag at it , " the RTO said . " No , wait a minute , " O'Hare said . " Call the firebase , " he directed the RTO . " Tell em we want some ilium . " The guard returned to his position and several minutes later a mortar-launched illumination flare popped over Delta casting the rocks and vegetation in a queer flat light . The sappers remained low and motionless . More flares popped and floated gently downwind on their parachutes . The sapper team within Delta 's perimeter eyed their foes . The ilium glimmered on the wet poncho-hootches . More flares popped . The mortar team kept the area lighted for twenty minutes until O'Hare cancelled the mission . Delta went back to sleep . Two hours passed . The sappers had not moved a hair . Delta twisted beneath their poncho tents . " Let 's keep it down , " O'Hare called out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir , it 's Willie , " a troop called back . " The fucker keeps snorin . " A third voice called out , " Bullshit . Now shut up . " From another position a man giggled . Then the chatter subsided and Delta slept again . The sappers moved . The outside team infiltratedbetween two sleeping guard positions . The inside team spread out . On a single click-signal all the sappers unloaded and fused their sachel charges . Then deftly they placed the charges by and where possible between the heads of the sleeping Americans . Immediately they began their withdrawal . The first team in crawled back to their cliff entrance and grabbed the M-60 and the ammunition . The secondteam crawled out . The first sachel charge exploded . Then another and another . All the GIs were up . People were running , screaming . More sachel charges exploded . O'Hare 's RTO found one between him and the captain and flung it out of their hootch . It exploded wounding a perimeter guard who had run for the CP as the blasts began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened up firing into the NDP . Other soldiers fired at their own men . Several Delta troops began running , shouting , trying to organize the unit . The M-60 fired upon the running troops . There was mass confusion . Delta did not know who was who . Then came a quick succession of small explosions . Explosions vary in length of time depending upon the amount and type of explosive . A quick explosion makes a sharp sound . Slower , longer burning materials cause a deeper sound , more of a roar . The sachel charges were slow and of relatively little power . The first few blew heads apart but most at best only blew out eardrums or eyes . At Alpha , a kilometer away , the old-timers recognized the sound . Four months earlier , on Hill 714 , the DIVA hadp412killed five Alpha boonierats using similar tactics . Now the NVA were throwing sachel charges into Delta 's perimeter to increase the chaos , get the GIs up and running so they could be shot by their own men . The unmistakable crackblast of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up then down . Alpha lay perfectly still , prone , in the mud . On 100 percent alert . At Delta a perimeter guard had squeezed his claymore claquer firing device . The claymore removed his face . " What 's that ? " Cherry whispered to Egan . " Sappers . Nobody up there firin . See if you can monitor . " " I do n't know their freq . " A call came from El Paso . " Pass the word . Sit tight . " Egan slithered off to check his platoon . " Lie quiet , " he repeated to each position . " Ambush team and LPs comin in . Watch for em . Do n't fire em up . " At Jax and Marko 's location Egan found the two talking . " Stop the chattering . Keep it down . " Jax rolled over . " Oh Man . Cut it out . If yo was a dink , would yo come tricky-trottin inta our AO ? Theys fuckin wid Delta , Man . They ai nt even gowin fuck with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the platoon RTOs . " L-T says we 're movin when the Dust-Offs come . Have em packed up . " When the medical evacuation helicopters reached the Khe Ta Laou they repeated the night medevac procedure they had used when Bravo had been hit five days earlier . A flare ship circled high above dropping flares and illuminating the entire sky . Four Cobras and two LOHs escorted the four Dust Off Hueys . Above the flock of birds was the charlie-charlie of the GreenMan . The noise was tremendousafter the silence of the night . On the valley floor Egan led off . Jax walked his slack . The LPs and the ambush team , all accounted for , formed a rear drag . The light above the medevac site glowed in the fog over the valley but on the ground it was dark . Egan bulled his way through the vegetation . He did not cut a path . He moved slowly . Sometimes he crawled , sometimes he sidestepped , but he never stopped . He used a lensmatic compass for direction and he led Alpha east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he had been expecting to lead the column on this exact move , as if he had practiced it . The medical evacuation from Delta took over an hour . The birds did not extract all the dead or the routine wounded . They would be evacuated during daylight . The birds removed only the eleven seriously wounded . Alpha had moved almost 200 meters east by the time the last medevac and the escort fleet left the valley . Egan stopped . He satp413down and waited as Brooks had instructed . Behind him the entire company sat . And sat quietly for the rest of the night . The next day would begin their fight . SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIESTHE FOLLOWING RESULTS FOR OPERATIONS IN THE O'REILLY/ BARNETT/JEROME AREA WERE REPORTED FOR THE 24-HOUR PERIOD ENDING 2359 18 AUGUST 70 : RAIN CONTINUED ON THIS DATE THROUGHOUT THE OPERATIONAL AREA CAUSING THE CANCELLATION OF 18 TAC AIR SORTIES AND THE POSTPONEMENT OF ONE COMPANY-SIZE ASSAULT .

ARVN UNITS MADE NO SIGNIFICANT CONTACTS ON THIS DATE.  |p416In  the gray yet dark Egan rose . He rose from the exact place he had sat hours earlier . He had not moved all night . Nor had he slept . Jax fell in behind Egan . They did not speak . Next back , Cherry was on the radio . He keyed the handset and whispered almost inaudibly , " Four , Two . Moving . Out . " He did not wait for a response . Behind the point Alpha rose , moving now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Co CP led down the center . The formation looked like a wide based bi-pod. 2d Plt moved south 50 meters toward the river then turned and followed 1st , lagging back 150 to 200 meters on the right flank . 3d Plt moved left 50 meters toward the road and followed 1st by 100 meters . The formation gave Alpha partial sweep advantages plus surprise drags to catch enemy followers and flanking and maneuver elements should they run head-on into the enemy . Egan led the head column eastward over successive undulating rolls through brush then bamboo and brush again . The valley floor rose toward the headwaters . Rain fell . The mist thinned . In column formation action usually happens at point , sometimesat drag , seldom in the middle . To middle-soldiers days passed as endless meaningless humps , walking , carrying a ruck and a weapon , following the man in front . Many middle-soldiers neither knew nor cared to know where they were going . Some did not care to know why . Some men gravitated to the middle . That was how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had spent most of six days at middle . Now as third man back he was eager almost zealous . His passions were boiling . He did not know why . Twice Jax motionedp417him to back away , to keep his interval . He calmed himself by singing marching songs within his mind . I do n't know but I been told , Cherry as march leader sang out . I do n't know but I been told , his Fictitious platoon answered back all in cadence . That her pussy 's made o gold , he sang . That her pussy 's made o gold , they answered . Cherry veiled , Sound Off ! The platoon , One Two . Cherry , Sound Off ! The platoon , Three Four . Cherry , Cadence count . They , One two three four , Onetwo-threefour . He began another verse . Had a girl from North Korea .. . Egan led Alpha east then south then east again . The valley floor swelled and fell yet each rise was higher than each fall . By dawn Alpha had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was still raining . The mist was below them . Egan climbed slowly up the first real hill in the valley floor . At the crest he stopped and squatted . He motioned Jax down and Cherry forward . From the crest they could see the river to the right and rolling hills before them . On the side of a mound , perhaps 170 meters away , there was a squad of NVA soldiers . They were walking in column , spaced , swinging their arms freely , seemingly oblivious to everything . Egan flattened . Cherry squatted slightly below him . Egan counted : eleven soldiers , eight with rifles , three unarmed . Every enemy soldier wore a pack . Egan immediately , instinctively , estimated their rucks to weigh forty pounds . They were traveling heavy , east , uphill . Maybe toward Bravo , Egan thought . He grabbed Cherry 's radio . He called Brooks , reported quickly . The flank columns stopped . Egan called the battalion TOC directly . Simultaneously he produced a small set of binoculars from his ruck and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cherry the binoculars . " Watch em , " he whispered . Cherry 's excitement doubled . " Rover Two , Red Rover One , " the radio responded . It was Major Hellman , the battalion executive officer . The GreenMan must he sleeping after last night , Egan thought . Quickly Egan explained the target . " Can you adjust fire from your location ? Over , " Hellman asked . " That 's affirmative , " Egan answered . The NVA squad was approaching hilltop . Cherry wanted Egan to hurry . " Armageddon Two , Rover Two , " Egan now radioed the artillery unit on Barnett . " Roger , Rover Two . This is Armageddon Two . Over . " Egan read off the coordinates . He spoke very quickly yet paced and distinctive and to Cherry it seemed slow . " Dinks in the open , " Egan said . He knew the cannon-cockers loved that call . " Lotsa links , " Egan encouraged them . Cherry followed the enemy 's progress through the binoculars . At the distance they appeared small and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . If they 're supposed to be so good , Cherry thought , how come they 're in the open ? " Whole battery . Hotel Echo . Airbursts at five zero , " Egan whispered . This was no time for test rounds . " Shot out , " Cherry heard the radio rasp . " Shot out , " Egan repeated gleefully . Then came a horrible rushing sound . Cherry 's heart was pumpingmassive surges of blood . Six rounds screamed down . Cherry 's eyes were pasted to the binoculars . He could see the horror on the faces of the enemy . The rounds exploded . Four NVA soldiers were blown down . The NVA dropped , scattered . A second salvo screamed down . The rounds seemed to explode on the ground but in reality they were bursting a hundred-sixty feet above the earth and explodinga hot metal shower downward . " Drop fifty . " Egan smiled . Cherry could see soldiers wriggling . Others limped . One seemed blown to bits . Another ran without arms . One body dragged itself without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seemed colorless and unreal . " Man , they 're still there , " Cherry began . " We got seven . Seven hit bad . Least two dead . Keep em firing . There 's some to the left . They ran left into that clump of trees . Some below . " Egan called in the adjustments . He was no longer watching the action . He watched Cherry . Egan smiled , chuckled at Cherry 's enthusiasm . His Cherry was going nuts . Egan loved it . " Here , " he said to Cherry . " You call in the adjustments . " Cherry took the hook . " Work em back en forth . " Now Cherry transmitted . " Left fifty , add one hundred . " The rounds screamed in and exploded uncomfortably close to Alpha . " Jesus Christ , watch it , " Egan laughed . " You 're s'pose to get them , not us . " Cherry laughed , muted and hysterical . Jax laughed at them both from below . Brooks had reached the point now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewing the enemy carnage on the hill before them . " Let 's go mop up , " Brooks said pleased . Alpha approached the site of the NVA dead cautiously . They were still in three columns , now spread farther apart , the two flanks forward , 1st Plt lagging in the center . They closed in upon the site . The flanks halted , 1st Plt swept up the middle . There were no bodies . No weapons . No equipment . There were a half-dozen blood trails and Polanski in 2d Sqd found a hand . Alpha pursued the blood trails south and west to the river 's edge . The trails vanished . Cherry was pissed . " Why do you expect them to leave the bodies of their comrades behind on the battlefield ? " Minh asked Cherry after Alpha had retreated to a thickly vegetated rise . They had setp419up a quick perimeter and were now eating breakfast and resting . At 1st Plt CP , Jax , Moneski , Doc Johnson and Lt. Thomaston were listening to Minh and Cherry . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride yourselves on never leaving an American soldier 's body behind . We Vietnamese are not different . The enemy is not different . It is not mysterious that they should take their dead and wounded . All armies do exactly the same . " " I do n't know , " Cherry said . " We saw about twenty dinks and I saw at least ten of em get greased . They musta had ah . . . there musta been like thirty or forty of em to sky like that . " " Hellman do n't believe we got em , " Monk said . " He was chewinout the L-T royal , Man . He did n't ee-ven need a radio . We coulda heard him right from the firebase . " " Why he on the L-T 's ass ? " Jax questioned . " Man , you know , " Doc said . Thomaston injected , " It do n't count unless you can verify the bodies . " " What ? " Cherry squealed . " That 's right , Bro , " Doc said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Cherry indicated he was okay . Doc motioned him away from the others . " You doan look right , Mista , " Doc said . " I 'm okay , Doc , " Cherry said . " Really . " Doc looked at him unbelieving . " I , ah , got some cuts en some jock rot . That 's all . " Doc still looked at him . " And , ah , the ah . . . the shits . " " McCarthy give you anything ? " " Naw , Doc . It 's okay . It 's goin away . " " Gon na get worse , " Doc said . " Mista , I ken smell ya . How long you had it ? " Doc questioned Cherry on every detail to Cherry 's embarrassment . " Listen , Mista , " Doc said finally , " that shit is dysentery . That caused by a flagellated protozoan . Dig ? Under adverse conditions they can form a cyst . Not form it themselves but cause it . Right now you jus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That triggers the peristaltic action which gives you the shits . You know what I mean ? " " Wow ! " Cherry said . Again the black medic with his Harlem street dialect had completely amazed him . He thought for a moment then asked , " What should I do ? " Doc pulled a vial from his pocket . " F-S-N 6505-074-4702 , " he read off the label . " Lomotil . Two pills , four times a day . Slows intestinal motility . Doan go 0-Din on em . " He handed the bottle to Cherry . Then Doc shook his head . He gave Cherry that unbelieving look again . " Man , " Doc whispered , " you still a cherry . I was n't gon na say this hut you got ta learn faster'n you is loin , Bro . You aintp420gonna be able to depend on Egan ta tell me somethin wrong withyou . He DEROSin in two weeks . " " Egan ? ! " Doc looked at Cherry again , shook his head and walked away . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lt. Brooks . Alpha was at the river . They had backed off the rise where they had eaten breakfast , again using the unequal three-pronged formation , and had moved west , downstream 200 meters . Egan had walked point , Jax slack . They had crossed five trails running from the river toward the north escarpment . Three of the trails were narrow and old . Foliage had closed over them and small yellow grass shoots choked their middles . Two were red balls . Both showed signs of recent heavy use . Alpha had moved quietly , slowly , until the sounds of a helicopter fleet broke upon the valley . At that point Brooks had directed them to move to the river . The maneuver was similar to the first river crossing except using three prongs eliminated the need to establish flank security . Alpha had sat just back from the river 's edge , observing . The helicopters were CAing Recon from Hill 848 to Delta 's position on the north escarpment . Even in the rain the helicopters flew . They would be in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How fair ? " he asked . " I use ta be on the swim team , " Cherry said . " Do you know what you 're volunteering for ? " Brooks asked . " Yes Sir . " Brooks studied his face . Cahalan crawled up to them . " L-T . " " Hey ? " Brooks whispered . He was still watching Cherry . " I just got word on Brunak . " Cherry and Brooks turned and looked at Cahalan . " They 're going to medevac him to Japan , " Cahalan reported . " They say he 's going to make it , they think . " " Good , " Brooks nodded . " Send FO up here . " Brunak , Cherry thought . Jesus H. , I 'd forgotten all about him and ... and Silvers . Cherry looked through the grass and brush . Fifteen feet away the Khe Ta Laou was shimmering dark . Silvers , Cherry thought . I got ta write his folks . Lt. Hoyden approached noiselessly and nodded to Brooks . " FO , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 300 meters downriver and maybe some on the knoll and some up behind us ? " " Can do , " FO said . He pulled out his map and asked , " Where do you want it ? " " Someplace to distract the little people , " Brooks said . " Somethingto make them keep their heads down . " " When ? " " Now . "  |p421FO  grabbed Brown 's handset and radioed Armageddon Two . He talked to the FDC officer giving coordinates and explanations . " In one five , " FO whispered to Brooks . " Behind us and across only . Too much bird traffic downstream . " Brooks nodded . He turned to Cherry . " Be ready . Go when the First round falls . " Cherry moved a few feet to the left . Cahalan and Hoyden disappeared into the vegetation away from the river . Lt. Caldwell appeared next to Brooks . Without trying Cherry overheard their conversation . " Larry , " Brooks asked . He sounded pissed . " Whatever possessed you to go straight through that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sarcastically , defensively , " my mission was to take my force east as best and as quickly as I could . " " Your primary mission , Lieutenant Caldwell , is to insure the safety of your people . Moving east was secondary . You needlessly exposed yourself and your platoon in that meadow . " " I did what I thought best , Sir , " Caldwell said tauntingly . " Well , fuck it . You 'd better start thinking differently , because , that was not the best . " Cherry moved down to just above the river 's edge . 1st Plt was behind him preparing themselves for the crossing . Cherry stripped naked . His crotch was still sore and inflamed . The infections on his arms were about the same . His asshole burned . The skin of his feet was mushy and convoluted . For all the cleaning he had tried to do in the last two days , he still stank . Being naked felt wonderful , even thought it was cold . Cherry took an end of the heavy crossing rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egan tied it . " Ask em ta call the weatherman , " Cherry whispered to Egan . " Ask em to turn on some sun . " " Shee-it , " Egan laughed . " I do n't think we know his freq . " " Maybe we can call God , " Cherry suggested . " This weather sucks . " Jax was there helping Egan coil the line . " God 's freq on the high hand , " Jax laughed . He went over to Cherry 's gear and fiddled with the frequency settings on the PRC-25 . " I think it 72/95 , " Jax chuckled , " but I doan know his call sign . " Cherry and Egan chuckled too . " Augh fug , " Jax continued . He returned the dials to the proper settings , " Yo caint git Him on this set . You need a monster set . " " Man , " Cherry whispered laughing , " maybe we can build a fire . I 'm freezin my balls off . " " Do n't mean nothin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no good out here . " Two rounds freighttrained across the sky then exploded top422Alpha 's south . A third exploded upriver . Cherry crawled to the water and slipped silently in . More artillery rounds exploded . Cherry breast-stroked at an angle into the current . He swam smoothly , quickly , silently , a very strong swimmer . In twenty seconds he was on the opposite bank . He crawled from the river , scampered up the bank , backed into some brush , grasped the rope and motioned for someone to come across . Egan slipped into the water in lights with both his and Ciierry 's rifles . Even the minimal equipment sunk him . Cherry strained on the rope trying to keep Egan up but Egan and the line went under . Cherry strained harder . Egan 's head broke the surface at mid-stream then down again . A minute later he emerged gasping at the far side . He stormed up the bank into cover , drained the barrel of both M-16s and searched the jungle . Jax was on his way over . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thomaston and Marko secured the rope . Jax began the defensivering . Egan stripped . He and Cherry slipped back into the water and became guides and life guards as the others crossed . Alpha 's move went quickly and no equipment was lost . On each crossing Cherry dove under and washed a bit of his body , mostly his arms . This is blessed water , he thought . On the bank Brooks caught himselfstaring at the two naked soldiers . He became upset with himself . " Fuckin gooks is aw'right , " Pop Randalph chuckled . " Look at them thangs , Sir . " Pop , Garbageman and Lt. De Barti had come to the CP with half a dozen traps . " I 'll be dipped in shit , " Garbageman giggled . " There got to be at least a dozen of em so far . " Where Alpha had emerged from the river , the bank was littered with bamboo scraps as if someone had had a small mill by the water . There were numerous footpaths leading up and down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2d had gone west downstream , 3d east upriver . Fifty meters downstream 2d found the fishing camp . Then 3d Plt found the marijuana fields . Minutes later 1st found the ruins of an old village . It was like nothing any of them had ever seen before in the mountains . De Barti held out two of the fish-traps to Brooks . " There 's fresh tracks all over the place down there , " the platoon leader said to the company commander . " It looks like they got maybe a platoon of dan cong ( civilian coolies ) doing nothing but catching fish for their troops . We 've got ten traps so far and we 've only swept a small stretch of bank . " Brooks lifted one of the traps and inspected it . The trap was a cylindrical bamboo cage closed at one end and having a bamboop423cone opening at the other . The traps were simple yet the workmanshipwas elegant . Brooks sighed . " How 's your security ? " he asked . Before De Barti could respond El Paso interrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then fields . Two , then a third and finally a fourth . Then Paul Calhoun called from 2d Plt to report that they could not collect any more traps because they could n't carry them all . " We 're in their fishin grounds , " Calhoun reported . " They got enough traps here to feed a regiment . We got a few small animal snares too . " A queer feeling ran up Garbageman 's neck to the base of his skull as the report came in . He no longer felt like giggling . " Destroy what you have , " Brooks directed De Barti . " Stop the search and get out of there . Mark it for arty . We 're moving southtwenty-west . " Brooks turned to his RTOs . " Cahalan , call in the report . We 're going over to 3d . " A quarter of Caldwell 's men were busy harvesting the crop they had found . Everyone else was on security . The four fields were in a square . Each patch was approximately 15 x 25 meters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before Brooks could inspect the fields , Thomaston radioed saying that 1st Plt had discovered the ruins of an ancient village . " It ca n't be too ancient if you 're finding old thatch , " Brooks radioed . " It 's all rotting . Rotten , " Thomaston transmitted . " It musta been a Montegnard ville but it 's collapsed and there 's new growth over it all . Over . " " Any indications of it on your funny papers ? Over . " " Negative that . There 's an abandoned ville indicated four kilos to the whiskey . Over . " " How many hootches ? Over . " " Six for sure . Maybe eight . They 're just lumps on the floor . There 's a new red ball running right through the ville . Five , six feetide with overhead cover . Beaucoup signs recent activity . Carts .. . does n't seem to go anyplace . " Major Hellman cut in on Alpha 's internal . " Quiet Rover Four , this is Red Rover One . Do you read ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Brooks responded . " I 've got you lUmpy chicken . Over . " Hellman said he had been monitoring Alpha and that he wanted the fields of marijuana cut and burned , the fishing traps collected for evacuation and the red ball monitored for enemy traffic . " UUUh , " Brooks grunted . He thought , that guy , someday he is going to get vervhody killed . Brooks did not answer Hellman 's order . Hellman reheated his order and Brooks snarled into the handset , " Just howp424in the fuck are we going to burn a fucken half-acre of grass out here , Red Rover ? It 's been raining down here for a thousand years . " " Rover Four Niner , do you know who this is ? " " I am not going to compromise my position for a few fucking fishing traps and a field of dew . You got the coordinates . You want to destroy it , fine . Go ahead . Over . Out . " Brooks seethed . He rammed the handset back into El Paso 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alpha continued their three pronged formation moving south away from the river 100 meters then arching southwest and finally west . There were signs of enemy activity everywhere . The North Vietnamese seemed to have an almost endless series of well engineereddirt roads and trails snaking south from the valley center toward the mountains . All routes had overhead cover . Egan was more apprehensive than he had ever been . Every step put them on a potential ambush site . They crossed from brush to elephant grass again as they descended . Egan stayed off the established trails except for crossing them . Then he approached slowly , stopped , observed and crossed quickly . At one point Egan thought 3d Plt was crowding 1st on the left flank . Nahele was at point there . Egan paused , brought Cherry up , radioed Kinderly . " I can hear you assholes , " Egan whispered . " Ai nt no way , " Kinderly answered . 3d was 100 meters back . Egan squatted and called a general halt . Recon 's airlift to reinforce Delta was completed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those pilots , Egan thought . They do incredible things . We should have a LOH on station . Jax had moved past Egan . Egan sat with Cherry . He called Brooks . " Feeling . Trail watchers to sierra . " They sat soundlessly . Whiteboy and 3d Sqd advanced to point . The column rose . Egan stopped Whiteboy and led off again himself , the big squad leader at slack , then Cherry . While they sat Cherry had plucked pieces of grass and stuck them into his helmetcover and ruck to break up the smooth lines of the radio and his head . Others had watched him and copied . Behind Cherry 3d Sqd followed , then the Co and Plt CPs , 2d Sqd and 1st now at drag . The other columns advanced also . All three were being watched . A disconnected thought vision came to Cherry . Disconnected from Nam . He did not know why or how the thought began . Perhaps the grass or being able to see the hills again triggered it or perhaps the sense of power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleansing action of the riverwater . The triggering stimulus made no difference to him , but the meaning of the vision seemed all important . As he walked , Cherry saw himself gliding above a ruggedp425stretch of California coast . The sun was out . It was a magnificent day , his second day as a soarer , a hang glider . Cherry had never attempted hang-gliding , had never been to California , had indeed no knowledge of soaring at all , yet in the vision every detail was perfect . He could see himself above the bluffs before the Pacific , could feel the cool ocean breeze . Three days earlier he had been to the doctor . He knew the history in the vision without having to see it or think it . Somehow , he had strained himself very badly and he had ignored it for a long time . Finally he had gone to see a specialist and the doctor told him he had poisoned his system . The condition is irreversible , the doctor explained . You will be dead within five days . Cherry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep depression . I3efore he had met with the specialist he had known what the man would say . The depression seeped from the vision to the soldier on the valley floor in Vietnam . Cherry felt very sad . Yet physically he felt strong . His muscles were in fine shape . The doctor had acknowledgedthat . Cherry decided to become a soarer as his last earthly feat . He also decided this would be the best way to end his life . He told no one . On his first day of soaring he was an excellent student . His instructor was a wing salesman and Cherry had the latest gear . It gave the soarer an incredible amount of control . They practiced , the salesman instructed and Cherry learned . Day two found them on the cliffs and bluffs just south of Mendocino . Perhaps Cherry had seen a TV special . How could he know these things ? How could it be so real ? It was a beautiful day with a crisp September wind gusting in crystal blue sky . Off Cherry leaped and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to marry his physical being with the Pacific coastline  --  that exact spot where it is neither land nor sea but sometimes either and sometimes both . A wavewashed rock-sand beach . He soared , first a bit awkwardly , then more and more gracefully . First just a bit above the bluff and then higher and higher over the ocean . Into dives then out to barrel rolls and loops . The new wing was more maneuverable than any earlier design . Higher . TheP wing was incredible . From three hundred feet over the bluff he could see the coast for one hundred miles and the endless ocean . Freedom , elation , higher . It is time , he said to himself . Cherry looked straight down . It was late afternoon . He had been in the air for three hours . Slowly he nosed over and folded the wing back into a missile , gravity shooting him ever faster toward the earth . The speed was terrific . The pressure of the wind on his eyes seemed to be ripping them apart . Tears squished out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Modern Age . Medical technology , enlightened legislation , frequent airline flights , and the amenities of a good nearby hotel made it possible for the professional woman to sandwich her first-trimester abortion between classes and have a whole week off to pamper herself against infection and deal with any remorse . But between now and Easter Tuesday was a special kind of Hell . Cate felt she was keeping a secret from her own body . Here it was , going happily along , thinking it was preparing for the futureof the baby . There was no way she could send it a signal saying , You are wasting your efforts . And that was another thing . Her body seemed to have taken so well to its new state . Between her first and second missed periods , one reason she was so sure she was n't pregnant was that she manifested none of those symptoms she had heard women complain about . Lydia had been unable to keep anything on her stomach for the first three months with Leo ; and with Dickie , she had begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom every fifteen minutes . Cate had experienced nothing but a sense of well-being and a tenderness in her breasts , which she always got before her periods , anyway . She felt a certain arrogance in her own good health , that she was capable of such a model pregnancy . But on this Saturday , when she had to mark time for ten more days , she determined that her best plan for the good of everyone ( herself , her fooled body , and the " it " slightly larger than a grape , with brain waves ) would be to immerse herself in nonreflective activity . She gathered up every item of clothing that could be put through the Laundromat machine ; she packed herself a lunch ; and off she drove into the Iowa spring morning , her chin tipped up an extra notch , singing along with the song on her car radio . There was therapy as well as a housewifely sense of accomplishmentin folding and stacking dozens of warm , clean-smellingpersonal garments : jeans and blouses worn soft and faded from long use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panties . Today she even liked her old Fieldcrest towels , with the white cars monogram on the royal blue . The factp201that these towels from her first trousseau had held up so well gave her a solid sense of being able to survive her own past . And even to carry it with her into her future  --  the parts of it that were useful . She had lunch in the sun at her favorite city park . The tips of the deciduous trees were red with bud , but it would be anotherfew weeks before their leaves unfurled . She missed the South most at this time of year ; its earlier spring . There were a few children playing close to their parents . Cate narrowed her eyes at them and waited to feel something that would make her rush to the nearest pay phone and cancel her appointment at the private Chicago clinic . But none of the children appealed to her . They were just not her type of people . Thank goodness . She could lift her face up to the sun and take another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still were some . She was healthy , she was smart , she was free ; she was not even old . How many people in the world today could tote up four such blessings ? She thought about Roger Jernigan . He was a busy man , but ever since that first night he 'd kept her informed about his movements . " I 'll be in Vail for six days , with Sunny . " " I 'm off to LA for some meetings ; guess I 'll take you-know-who to lunch . She 's invited Jody to spend Easter with her . " " I 'm driving up to Ames to check out a few things at Ag Research . I went to college there , you know . I do n't guess you 'd care to drive with me . Oh hell , that 's right . That 's your Drama day . Well , Jody will have the benefit of you , at least . " Right now he was in Washington , meeting with his old enemiesat the Environmental Protection Agency . ( " Progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned sure . The world will go on eating . So I guess we 'll have to work out something between us . " ) He was attracted to her . He enjoyed her mind . He liked lying beside her in bed and testing her reaction to various subjects . The more independently and assertively she expressed herself , the better he seemed to like it . Some of her ideas were strange and unworkable , he told her , but they made him see thatp202there were more worlds than his . He liked that : there were more worlds . He told her she was " classy . " He once asked her , just as he was covering her body with his own , " What are you doing with an old country hick like me ? " But the playful , confident green eyes sent a message that contradicted his professed humility . Though his physical type did not attract her , she responded to his physical presence . She could not be aesthetically objective about him when he looked at her or touched her . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a man so busy in his own world ( which many men would have thought was the only world ) took her so seriously . It made her like herself and him better . And each time he had come to her apartment on this street he already owned , he had shown a touching respect . He took everything in , wanted to know where things were kept , asked questions about how she lived . She understoodhe was trying to imagine her in her own world and that her different way of life , her independence , both baffled and charmed him . " That 's pretty . I like that , " he would say , picking up a trilobite fossil she used as a paperweight . " Did you find that yourself ? Where ? " " That 's a nice picture "  --  of her Georgia O'Keeffe print , The Lawrence Tree  --  " I could be comfortable with that , myself . " " Did your mother make you this pillow ? You made it ? You embroidered all those little flowers ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hmm . Not too bad . They could have at least given you a bigger TV . You watch it much ? Where do you sit when you grade papers ? Are you reading all of those books on that table ? " " Do you cook for yourself when you 're alone ? " " Has anybody in your family been to visit you here ? " He kept a bed for himself at the plant and slept over when he had early appointments , rather than drive the forty miles up and back from the castle . " The castle , " he called it , in the same tone as you would say " the cottage . " Architecturally it was a castle , that was all there was to it . He had spent several nights with her in February , while his scrubbers were being installed , but he always left early , before dawn . " I do n't want to bump into your landlord . " " I do n't care if you do , " said Cate ( who did , ap203little ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sense . " " All the more reason , " muttered Jernigan , wrinkling his nose disapprovinglyat the sock he was putting on for the second day . There was no getting around it . Roger Jernigan was a nice man . But did she love him ? He had come into her life when her self-esteem was ailing and her defenses were low , and he had made her feel safe and appreciated . She was pretty sure he was n't in love with her , either . He liked to take her out to dinner ; he liked to talk to her ; he liked to go to bed with her in her quaint lair with its brave starkness and its feminine touches . He was , perhaps , a little flattered that " a woman of intellect " should find him interesting . But he had never invited her to his home  --  or castle , rather . After their first dinner , he had never again suggested that she might meet the mysterious Sunny sometime . Probably he was the sort of man who draws a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his family life . Stupid word , " mistress . " It did n't apply , really . But , whatever she was to him , she had made up her mind to keep the pregnancy to herself . He was never going to know about it . She thought she knew him well enough to know it would make him feel sad ; he 'd already had enough problems with children . He was not to know . And then she would have to be chaste for a while after the abortion ; Ann had explained that . So that would probably be the end of things between them : he would think she no longer wanted to go to bed with him . That was a pity . Though her present circumstances had dampened desire , she had enjoyed sheltering beneath his solid warmth . " I want to postpone the inevitable for you a little longer , " he had said , that first night . He had meant the cold . Well , they had got each other through the winter . Now there was another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her postpone that . All his money and warmth could not protect her from having to make the lonely decision she had come to . She put the crumpled trash from her solitary picnic back into the brown bag , like a good citizen , and left the park . It was still quite early in the day , but the sun was not as warm as itp204looked . God only knew how she was going to get through the rest of the weekend . But she knew she would see it through somehow , even if she had to resort to sleeping it through . Two things comforted her . Though , as Jernigan would say , they made strange bedfellows . She was as proud of her stoic decision to keep her condition from the man who had helped cause it as she was of her wholesome , symptomless pregnancy . She managed to sleep away the rest of the afternoon . She watched the evening news . Dire ramifications continued to multiplyfrom the accident at Three Mile Island . Now everybody knew what the inside of a nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it had taken a near catastrophe  --  or maybe it would turn out to have been a slow-blooming catastrophe  --  to make people pay attention . Maybe it was already too late for everybody . In their greed and shortsightedness , maybe they had set too many things going that were now curling inevitably like boomerangs and heading back , even at this very hour  --  like those pieces of Skylab due to fall this summer  --  to do them in . How could a world know when it still had one more chance , and when it had reached the point of no return ? How could an individual know ? She decided to get drunk , and opened a bottle of wine . But , after a few sips , abandoned the idea . Drinking wine had lost its savor for her lately . Now why was that ? Nature 's way of protecting ? What was already booked for extinction . She considered calling Ann for reassurance . But she knew what Ann would advise . ( " Avoid sordidness . Avoid qualmishness . Above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as women is the right to choose whether or not to have children . That 's all the philosophy you need . And stop torturing yourself by picturing a little Einstein in there sending out brain waves . I 'd like to send that Dr. Happe a poison-pen letter . He 's never had to decide whether or not to have a child . " ) And when the phone rang , Cate almost did n't answer because she thought it might be Ann . She had reached the point where she preferred her own individual suffering-through of herp205experience to listening to sterile assurances from someone who obviously had not suffered in the same way . In the end , curiosity won , and Cate picked up the receiver and it was Nell . But as the call went on , it seemed more and more like a bad joke . Daddy had died less than four months ago , krypton gases were wafting invisibly across America , and here was Mother , light-headed to the point of being a little silly over the social politicsof the Mountain City Book Club . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have an abortion , and all Mother could do was speculate on the future of Wickie Lee 's **25;9223;TOOLONG girl which had taken less than three hours to deliver . Of course Cate knew she was not being fair : her mother did n't even know she was pregnant . But she did n't feel like being fair . She felt like bursting into blubbery , childish tears and dumping the whole problem in Nell 's lap : " Oh , Mother ! What shall I do now ? " And when Nell said , " Have fun in Chicago , " Cate felt as if the top of her head were going to blow off . She could hardly speak . She heard herself imitating some other daughter 's voice as she said , " Good night , Mother . " That her mother did not seem to know the difference only reinforced what Cate had suspected all along : Nell would have liked her to be a different daughter . Cate hung up and waited to go mad . It would have been a relief . Complete abdication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost her balance and fallen back into Roger Jernigan 's arms . The temptation she had felt to keep on falling . To give up on keeping her stubborn , weary balance and just sink . What good was she doing anyone by trying to be herself ? What good was she doing herself ? But , because she was herself , she could n't stop believing in her future , even at a moment like this . She would probably be believing in her future even as they were lowering her into the grave . Her dry , feverish eyes scanned the room , searching for something that could ratify her existence and shine some light on her future . She sprang off the bed with a cry of relief when she spotted her trusty 1 Ching languishing among other neglectedp206books on her brick-and-board shelves . How could she have overlooked its mysterious potential for instruction for so long ? She carried it back to bed as if it were a cherished companion . It was full of strips of paper , note cards , a few envelopes , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of Jake 's : Kuei Mei , The Marrying Maiden . There was a date on it , March 21 , 1967 . Oh yes , she remembered what that one had been about . Jake had thrown the coins , shortly after they were married , wanting to know whether he should go into a foreigncarventure with a friend ( Jake always asked very literal questionsof the old Chinese oracle ) , and they 'd had a fight when he got Six at the Top , which was crammed full of images of violence and failure , which Cate had then tried to convince him were symbolic , not literal . But unfortunately , the language had worked against her . The last sentence of Six at the Top read : " This impious and irreverent attitude bodes no good for a mar-riage . " Cate got three pennies from her purse , returned to bed , and smoothed the sheet flat . When Jake had asked his literal questions , he had done so with the luxury of genuine old Chinese coins , bought in an antiques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coins , she phrased her question in the spirit of the ancient Chinese philosophers . She felt she would receive a better answer that way . They had used the book to discover the truth of a given moment , and thus to decide how to behave in accordance with all the ingredients which made up that moment . So she did not ask anything so literal as " What should I do about Chicago ? " She closed her eyes , shook the coins passionately , and asked , " What is my present situation ? " The pennies fell , with muffled clumps , upon the sheet . When she had thrown them six times , she had Ku for an answer , Work on What Has Been Spoiled ( Decay ) . Her heart sank as she began to read . Ku was the Chinese character for a bowl in whose contents worms were breeding . But then she read on and her spirits lifted a little . The I Ching never left you without some hope . Her conditions were bad , but not yet spoiled . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were the ancients backingp207her up on her Chicago decision ? No , she must remember not to be literal . All the I Ching could tell you was the truth of the moment . She read further and it told her she did not have fate to blame for her present state of corruption , but rather the abuse of human freedom . She was looking up her Nine in the Third Place when the phone rang . Nine in the Third Place meant " setting right what has been spoiled by the Father . " There would be a little remorse , no great blame . Well , thank you , oracle , for small favors . It was Jernigan calling from the airport . " I 'm back early . We did n't accomplish a damn thing . I 've been thinking of your quiet little haven all the way back . I do n't suppose I could drop over ? Or were you already in bed ? " " I 'm in bed with a book . But I 'm dressed . As you know , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She heard her jaunty , ironic voice with a bit of mistrust . Why was she encouraginghim to believe she was her confident old self as usual ? She felt she ought not to want to see him . On the other hand , he was the only person she could think of who actually seemed to admire her for what she was . " I have to get a bite to eat . Or shall I bring something for both of us ? " " You know what ? I 'd love a pizza . " Suddenly she wanted a pizza more than anything in the world . Chicago and bowls full of writhing worms seemed manageable , if only she could have a pizza . " With pepperoni and sausage and anchovies and green peppers , if that 's not too greedy . " Roger Jernigan laughed . " You do n't know how nice it sounds after all the pussyfooting I 've been through in Washingtonto hear someone say what they really want . Will that be all ? No mushrooms ? " " Oh yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good . I like mushrooms . Well , expect me in about thirty , forty-five minutes . " She ran herself a bath and pondered over which incense to burn while she soaked . As incense was one of her weaknesses , she could choose among " Lumiere , " " Song of Bengal , " " Purityp208Jasmine , " " Radha 's Devotion , " and " Krishna Musk . " Philosophy dictated " Lumiere , " but humor egged her on to " Purity Jasmine . " She lit a stick of " Purity Jasmine " and lowered herself , with a gratified sigh , into the tub . Enough bowls of worms for one day . Now to eat pizza and enjoy being Jernigan 's fragrant , intelligentpriestess of higher sensibility after his frustrations in bureaucraticWashington . Not a flicker in her face would give away her secret . She looked forward to this exercise in self-effacement . She put on one of her freshly laundered pairs of jeans and found she could n't zip them all the way up . Already ? She sucked in her stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of the door . A bloated look , but no actual curve yet . She put the old jeans back on and wore a white satin shirt outside , like a tunic . She heard his Jeep prowling softly down her deserted little street ; there was no time left to pin up her hair . She opened her door and watched him come trudging up the creaky stairs in dark , shiny shoes . He looked very official in his man-of-the-world clothes . He carried a large , flat cardboard box that emanated irresistible smells . His face was in shadow , but she could tell he was smiling . She realized she envied him . She would have liked to be Jernigan , climbing toward herself , having only the kinds of problems that can be left outside . " Lady ordered a large pizza with everything on it , " he mumbled , trying to sound like a delivery boy . His jaw was etched with five-o'clock shadow and he wore a severe dark pinstripesuit . He had hunched his shoulders obsequiously to go with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the habit of command . He was no more capable of passing for a delivery boy than he was for the handyman she had briefly mistaken him for when he had first entered her office in his work clothes . He presented her with the pizza box and gave her a spousely peck . " Peace and sanity , at last , " he said . " Your hair looks nice , down like that . I 've never seen it down . Of its own accord , I mean . " His eyes flashed slyly , reminding her of their intimacies . He handed her the box.  | " I 've never seen that suit before , " she said . There would be the problem of going to bed . He would expect it . But , having given him up in her mind , would n't it be unfair to them both to go to bed again ? Yet she could n't tell him she had given him up . Or why . " It 's my East Coast business suit , " he said , going into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , you ca n't even see my red neck in this suit . But now that you 've seen me looking respectable . . . " He took off his coat and tie and hung them on a wall hook just inside the door . He stood with his hands on his hips , a stocky , solid man in dark trousers and a blue oxford cloth shirt , and surveyed her walls and ceiling with the air of some harassed person who has just entered a cathedral . " Damn . Let 's you and me trade places for a month . I 'll stay up here and read your books and you be me and go out there and make the decisions I have to make . I 'll accept whatever you decide . Just come back at the end of the month and say , ' Roger , I decided to scrap the new Tru-Gro Formula because with these new registration laws it 'll cost too much to test . I decided to go ahead with the viral formulainstead , even though we wo n't see any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might be dead . And , speakingof your son and heir , I decided to allow Jody to pierce his ears . ' What do you say ? Will you trade places for a month ? " Cate stood looking at him . She was still holding the box , which was very warm on the bottom . She was full of conflicting feelings : resentment that he saw her life as so effortlessly lofty ; envy that his major decisions concerning profit and loss lay outsidehimself ; affection for the way he at least tried to imagine her life , and for the way he allowed himself to be yoked to the aberrantwhims of his younger son . She had also felt an unexpected shock and grief when he had joked of his own death . What did that mean ? She decided she would rather not explore it , just now . " You might not enjoy making some of my decisions , " she said . She had meant it to come out with a light irony , but instead it sounded bitter and accusing . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had planned to meet him tonight . Where wasp210her self-control ? " I 'll just stick this in the oven for a few minutes so it 'll be good and hot , " she added , in an upbeat " **25;9250;TOOLONG " voice that suddenly recalled to her how Mother , whose moods ran the gamut from wry humorist to ferocious disciplinarianwhen she was home alone with the girls , would turn into a smooth hostess the moment Daddy came through the door . She went into the kitchen and switched on the oven and slid the pizza onto a baking sheet . She got out silverware and cloth napkins and , though she knew he was standing quietly in the doorway watching her , his arms folded across his chest , she affectedmore concern for a soap spot on one of the wineglasses . She held it up to the light and polished away the spot with a dishcloth . She kept Jernigan at a distance in her thoughts as a safeguard against the capitulation she had felt coming on in the other room . To make herself hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her own " hostess " voice a few moments ago had been an exact duplication of Mother 's , even though she , Cate , had n't been sincere . Maybe , all those years ago , Mother had n't been sincere , either . They had both been acting out the old scene of getting their man from the outside world to the kitchen , sparing him the household battleground in between . But it had confused her and Lydia , as little girls , when their mother suddenly became smaller and smoother when Daddy came home . Cate 's way of steadying herself against the sudden chemical change in the family mixture had been to assumethe more ferocious properties of the vanished mother , while Lydia , the baby , had retreated into the quiet , neat shell of herself . Which , Cate saw now , not only kept Lydia from being noticed ( i.e. , punished ) but made Lydia resemble a small copy of the " tamed " mother . But what good was such knowledge , years too late ? That old family configuration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would wake up one morning and all the ambivalentdynamics between herself and the important people in her life would snap into place , like a completed picture puzzle . And she could sit there all by herself and gaze down at thep211understood patterns and revel in the fruitless wisdom of hindsight . " Why would n't I ? " asked Roger Jernigan , leaning against the doorframe with his arms folded across his chest . " Why would n't I like making your decisions ? " " I just do n't think you would , that 's all . " This time she kept out the bitter tone and even managed a nonchalant shrug . " Try me , " he persisted , grinning . " I might be very good at your decisions , just as you might be very good at mine . Beginner'sluck , intuition , that kind of thing . Or maybe your decisions are so esoteric you do n't have faith in my capacity . " He raised his bushy eyebrows , still grinning . He was enjoying this game they had started  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transition between their separate existences and the moment when they could lapse into a shared meal , or a shared bed . It was obvious to her that he had missed her bitter undertone and that he was oblivious to how far away from him she had roamed just now . Jake would never have missed these things , even though he had often used them against her ; the Resident Poet would have picked them up from her face , read them in the air . Did Jernigan lack the finely tuned radar that could pick up the subtle shift of mood , the small nuance that registered  --  infinitesimally  --  a large lie ? Despite his curiosity and willingness to imagine her life , was there a thickness in him that would make it easy for her to avoid his scrutiny on what he called " esoteric " levels ? It disappointed her to think so . Yet it made things easier for her if she could discover a fault in him that must keep them apart . Such a fault reinforced her Chicago decision . And having provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she felt strangely tender toward him , as if she must protect him from the knowledge of his stunning flaw . " They 're not esoteric at all , " she said good-humoredly . " They 're very practical . They 're so practical they 're boring . " If he persisted , she could always rattle off some other decisions that hung in the immediate future : the kinds of decisions that , though annoying , she knew she could make with the upper half of her mind.  | " Well ? Try me , " he persisted . " Oh , I ask myself whether I should try to find another apartment , since this one 's going to be torn down , assuming I 'll have a job here next fall . The President has been evasive . He offers hope but no contracts . Several of us have been to see him . Or I ask myself whether I should n't be getting rid of everything but what I can pack into my car , come the end of May , so I can drive right off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , should I drive east or west ? And whose hospitality can I impose on while I try to find an opening at another college that 's just about to go under . " She had achieved her old mocking irony and grew more cheerful as she spoke , doing a graceful knee bend to remove the pizza from the oven and transfer it to a large , round ceramic platter . She poured his glass full of wine , hers half-full so he would n't notice she 'd gone off it , and waved him graciously to his place at the table . " So you see ? "  --  she helped him to the first slice of pizza  --  " my decisions offer neither the excitement of big business nor the novelty of Jody 's earrings . Does he want to pierce both ears , by the way , or just one ? There 's a difference , you know . " " He said both . At least , I think he did . But he 'll do what he wants . When he goes to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt encourage him . I 'm sure he asked me only for form 's sake . Or to get a rise out of me . He knows I ca n't fill the holes back in . " He surveyed his cutlery thoughtfully , remembered to spread his napkin in his lap , and began cutting up his slice of pizza with a knife and fork . " What do you mean about there being a difference ? " " Well , there 's a complex system , it seems . Depending on whether you wear two earrings , or one , and in which ear , it 's supposed to signal your sexual preference . Or preferences . " Jernigan groaned . " I guess I 'll just wait and be surprised . " When he saw that she was eating her pizza from her hand , he put down his knife and fork . " Think I 'll join you with the fingers . " " It 's the only way , is n't it ? " They both ate silently , a little greedily . She poured him more wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not drinking your wine , " he noted . " Oh yes I am . " She picked up her glass and took a showy sip . " There . I 'm drinking my wine . " The bitterness was back , she could feel it emanating in thick , dark waves from herself . She looked forward to his leaving . At last he scrubbed his mouth with the napkin and pushed his plate away from him . " I would n't plan on a job at Melanchthonnext fall , " he said , not looking at her . " That 's confidential . It 's not to go out of this room . But you and I are friends and I think you should know . " " Well , thank you . That takes care of two decisions . No job at the college , no need to get another place to live . Is the college closing , then ? " He nodded . " But remember , it 's confidential . " " All right , but I 'm annoyed . Why could n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April . People need time to write letters for jobs . " " Just be grateful you were n't laid off in December . " " Grateful to whom ? " He picked up his napkin , started to fold it , then crumpled it into a ball and threw it down on the table . " Well , dammit , to me . Jody 's last semester at Melanchthon College is going to cost me approximately three hundred thousand dollars . " " I suspected you were . . . helping out , " said Cate dryly . " But I still do n't see why we could n't know , those of us who have to find jobs for next year , that the college would be closing . The President lied to us . He let us think that there might be a chance . " " That 's partly my fault . I told him I 'd help out next year if he could find others to carry part of the load . He has n't found ' em . He 's had five months . Damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seems to have his head up in the clouds with Jesus . Well , maybe Jesus will come through . But I 'm not running a one-man charity show any longer . I want Jody to have his diploma , and I want his class to graduate and have the fun of it . Not feel like they 're going down on a sinking ship . I want the college to act like a college right up to the last minute my sonp214graduates from it . If that 's selfish or ' devious , ' I 'm sorry . Like I told you once before , I try to take care of what 's mine . " " In other words , you have n't told the President you wo n't be helping out next year . " " No , I have n't . I 'll tell him the day after Jody gets his diploma . If he knows now , he 'll start cutting corners . He 'll probablycancel the speaker , or something . If I 'm running this show till the end of May , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Cate . She gave him a thin , sarcastic smile . " I 'd best keep my mouth shut since you 're paying my salary , sir . " Oh good , she had wounded him . He looked up at her , surprised . " I thought we understood each other , Catie . Seems to me we had a similar argument over Mr. Terry and after I explained matters you saw my side . I guess I was wrong . " " We can never understand each other , " said Cate bitterly . " And when did you start calling me ' Catie ' ? Nobody in my life has ever called me ' Catie . ' It 's not your right . I do n't belong to you , even if you are paying my salary . " The bitterness overflowed from her eyes . So much for her exercise in graciousness and self-control . She picked up her wineglass and drained it . She felt the wine hit her stomach and bounce back . Bolting from the chair , she made it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallons of undigested tomatoesand cheese and dough and peppers and sausage and mushrooms . So much for the girl who wanted everything and could tell you what she wanted . So much for satisfying one 's greedy appetites . Payment was always demanded . You always had to pay in the end . Weak from vomiting , she struggled from her kneeling position and flushed the toilet . She washed her face and swished toothpaste around in her mouth . She listened and heard nothing . Please God , she prayed , let him be gone . I certainly gave him every reason to leave without saying good-bye . He was sitting on the edge of her bed when she came out of the bathroom . His shoulders slumped and his face looked old . When he was not feeling confident and in charge , the jaw was rounded and slack . She saw how , if life had gone differently forp215him and he had not believed in himself , he could have looked like someone 's handyman . She felt pity and repugnance . Better for him to have gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's this all about , Cate ? " he asked . His voice was cold and weary . " You 've been acting strange ever since I came in the door . If you did n't want to see me , why did n't you say so on the phone ? But you sounded so friendly and then when I got here you acted like we were enemies . Yes , you did . Even before I told you about the college . I may be a simple man , but I 'm not that simple . Something 's missing in you . You 're different . Will you be good enough to tell me what 's going on ? " " I was sick , " she said , to defend herself against this hard , impersonal tone . He frightened her when the curiosity went out of his eyes and they looked upon her with this weary gaze . He just wanted their business summed up between them so he could cut his losses and go home . " I was sick in the bathroom . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is it because you 're sick of me ? " But here he could not stop the old playfulness from creeping back into his expression . It undid her . " No , it 's because I 've become allergic to wine , " she said , slowly . She measured her words to the cadence of a stately death march . " I 've become allergic to wine because , contrary to what you said about there being something missing in me , something'sbeen added . I am different . I 'm pregnant . " He got up from the bed . He looked her over , narrowing his eyes as though he were trying to penetrate her womb with X-ray vision . " I know I 'm not supposed to ask this , but is it  --  " " Yes , " said Cate . " I 'm old-fashioned . I only have one lover at a time . " " But how in hell  --  I mean , do n't you always use all that paraphernalia ? " " I ca n't figure it out , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whimsical joke she had told to Ann , about thesperm becoming immune to the jelly ; then wished she had n't : itsounded lewd . It certainly spoiled the stately death-march mood . He gave a sharp , joyless laugh . " Nothing 's impossible . Igave up thinking I could control nature a long time ago . You canp216surprise it , or divert it , once in a while , but it always has some surprises of its own . " " Yes , " said Cate . They were standing several feet apart , their arms dangling at their sides , like combatants who have lost the zest for any further engagements . " What should we do ? " " What I 'm going to do is go to a clinic next week . In Chicago . Over the spring holidays . It 's a simple procedure , I 'm told . I 'm sure I 'll be in excellent shape to finish up the semester without cutting any corners . " She could n't resist one little dig . " That 's what you want , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She could tell if she could look at his eyes , but somehowshe could n't quite meet them . " Yes , " she said . " I 'm really sorry . I would n't have had this happen for the world . " " Well , it did . Besides , it 's one half my fault . Takes two , you know . " " The Chicago thing , how much is it going to cost you ? " For one horrible moment she was afraid he was going to reach into his back pocket and fish out his wallet . But he was only steadying his back with his hand . Now she did look at his face . He looked deathly tired . He had expected to come up into her sanctuary of truth and light and be washed clean of his manly cares . The human condition suddenly appeared very hopeless to her , and she simply wanted to end this exchange with dignity . " I 'd rather you did n't worry about that . They 're very reasonable . " She laughed sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the working girl 's budget . I 'm not saying it wo n't set me back some , but I want to pay . Like I said , I 'm an old-fashioned girl in some ways . It will soothe my conscience to have to pay . So please do n't say any more about it . " " I feel responsible . What about my conscience ? How am I going to soothe it ? " " You mean you 've been a free man all these years and you 've never had this happen before ? " " As far as I know , it 's only happened twice . And they'rep217both at home asleep now . " There was just a touch of moral smugness , the way he said this . It set Cate off . " Well , maybe you ought to be heading home to tuck them in . Take care of what 's yours . And leave me here to  --  to take care of what 's mine . " Their eyes met , then , in shocked awareness of what she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could feel the tears just about to come down . For a minute he looked as if he were going to stride over and take her in his arms and offer enough tenderness to absolve them both . But either she had imagined it because she wished it , or else he had decided he did n't have enough to offer . " Maybe I ought to be heading on up the river , " he said , glancing at his watch . " They do n't expect me until tomorrow but I can certainly understand you 've had enough trouble from me . " He went over to retrieve his coat and tie from her wall hook . " It has n't all been trouble . " She wanted to stretch out her arms in front of the door , to prevent him from leaving her alone with her thoughts . Thus she appeared all the more rigid as she stood there , half turned away from him , watching his departure movements out of one eye . " We kept each other warm during the coldest part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said sarcastically as he put on his coat . He whisked his tie from the hook , gave it an angry look , then balled it up and jammed it in his coat pocket . " Try to remember the good times , " she said inanely as he was unlatching the Yale lock to let himself out . " I 'll phone you in a couple of days , " he said . " We 'll hurt each other if we go on tonight . " " Thank you for bringing the pizza . " She was crying now and hoped he could hear it in her voice , though she was too proud to move . It was not too late . He could still stride across the room and comfort her . " You 're welcome . I 'm sorry you did n't enjoy it more . Good night , Cate . " Then he was out of her vision . She heard the door relatch itself softly . Heard his footsteps beating a brisk retreat from herp218Sanctuary . She fell across the bed and slammed a pillow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing his Jeep 's engine catch and rumble away down the silent , condemned little street . She lay there , in her jeans and satin shirt , too dispirited to get up and undress . There was a pounding in her temples . She remained motionless , sprawled horizontally across the bed , trying to imagine a way out . There was no way out . She must find a way to relieve some of the pressure of being unable to get out of her mind and her body . Then she remembered something she had used during the last months with Jake , when he was going crazy and trying to make her crazy , too . It was a little mental exercise that had appearedof its own accord , one night , as she lay alone in bed in their Greenwich Village apartment and awaited Jake 's next assaulton her sanity . By then , he had built himself a platform in the living room and piled it high with blankets and pillows and hung ragged tapestries and Indian bedspreads all around so she could not " spy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back from teaching at the Upper East Side girls ' school , he would be behind the hangings , on his platform . He had stopped speaking directly to her by then , but as soon as she came through the door , she would hear him switch on the tape recorder behind the hangings , and his recorded voice would begin its daily mad harangue , listing her faults , calling her insulting names , and accusingher and her petty bourgeois notions of impeding his progress to godhood . She would fix supper and leave a plate for him on the kitchen counter . She would take her supper into the bedroom and shut the door and grade papers or work on her dissertation  --  tothe accompaniment of the tapes . When one finished , he would put on another . There seemed to be an endless supply ; he must have spent most of the day recording them . All that work and energy dedicated to madness ; and , though he had done his best to burn out his mind with drugs , some of his accusations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he knew what would shock and hurt . At some point during the evening , shep219would hear him creep to the kitchen , like a cautious animal , to seize his supper . She knew he was taking drugs . The only thing she could n't figure out was where he got them and how he paid for them . Her sanity was very important to her at this time , and her self-concern must have been what had brought on the little exercise . If she could hold on , long enough to write her dissertation and get them out of here  --  Jake had fared better with more open space around him , though she had taken this job because he had wanted to " try New York "  --  she could bring him through this period . She did n't mind being the strong one with the most to give . She had married him , and she wanted to honor the difficult part of the vows . One failed marriage was regrettable , but two might mean the failure had something to do with her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imagine a second divorce . She preferred to cling to the dwindling hope that she might yet save Jake ; they could move to Vermont or New Hampshire , where she could teach at one of the many small colleges there , and he could farm or do carpentry , which was more facesavingthan waiting for her in a city apartment . He felt he had been jilted by his own times . He had quit school and prepared for a revolution that did n't seem to be coming , and now he was falling apart because he saw that the future intended to pass him right by , even though he had offered it his youth and brightness . He was metamorphosing back into a raging infant , but he could still use his adult intelligence to think up new ways to test her loyalty and devotion . The longer he lived off her salary , the more violent became his efforts to force her to admit the contemptuousnessof money . Contradictions abounded . He wanted to lean on her as an infant leans on Mommy , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a god like him . One morning , while she was in the bathroom , she heard his tape-recorded voice inviting her to come immediately to an " art show " on his platform . Like the optimistic fool she was , she went . He had sneaked out of the apartment . On the walls behind the platform were smeared childlike drawings . In shit . But even that had n't been the end . She had washed downp220the walls with ammonia . As he had known she would . Did n't Mommy have to clean up Baby 's mess ? It was when she came home early , one afternoon in November of 1969 , and discovered him sitting around perfectly sanely , in a perfectly friendly way , with his customers . There were little packages out on the coffee table and a pile of money . Jake was the local dealer . She kicked him out then . She was " bourgeois " enough to see the necessity of doing that . But before the packages on the table , she had gone to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to keep this household going . After she had done her work , she would turn off the light and try to empty her mind . A favorite trick of his was to wait until she had fallen asleep , and then to put on a fresh tape . She was never quite prepared for what she might wake up hearing about herself . One night she had lain there in the unsafe dark , wondering whether he was asleep or awake and , if the latter , when the next tape would start , and she had begun to split . She had felt her sanity threatened for the first time . Then the little exercise had thought itself into her head . It was as if she stood in the center of a circle , which was her mind , and she was provided with a broom , and every time a bad thought tried to cross the borders of the circle , she must sweep it out with her broom . As long as she could keep alert and hold on to the little broom , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : dark , amorphous blobs , rather like the shapes she had washed off the wall behind Jake 's platform . Sweep , sweep , went her busy broom , and the shapes fell back . She knew that if she could keep the circle clean long enough for her energies to regenerate themselves , she would survive . The circle needed time in which to heal itself . She got so good at the exercise that she could keep sweeping the circle clean even if one of the tapes did start . The words had no power over her . She got so she could sweep herself into sleep and wake up able to go on . Even during sleep , she left the guardianpart of herself turning around and around in that circle , ready to attack the first dark encroacher with the broom.  |p221So  , after Jernigan left , Cate lay rigid and quiet , with her eyes tightly shut , and stood in the center of the circle with her broom . Nothing must be allowed in . Not the future ( whatever and whereverthat would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face , cocky and commanding or weary and sagging , as if she had managed to defeat him ... no . Out , thought . Sweep the circle clean . Not the dirty plates waiting on the table in the kitchen , attractingroaches and mice . Not even that . She turned and swept , swept and kept turning , until at some point her circular vigilance went on automatic and she was rewarded with a sort of sleep . Later , a dream crept in , but it was a mild dream , neither healing nor awful . It could have been much worse . She dreamed that she was packing her car and doing a neat job of it . Books , clothes , cooking pots , a large exotic potted plant , the likes of which she had never seen , were all fitted snugly into their allottedspaces . The leaves of the plant waved intelligently , as if they were expressing the plant 's thoughts , and she was thinking how well she had managed all this and how nice the plant would be for company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her car . She was like Theodora 's Azalea , but she was also , somehow , Cate 's friend and maid . She was carrying a bundle in her arms , something Cate had forgotten to pack . It was a baby . For a minute , Cate was annoyed . Where was she going to put it ? But then she saw a place for it , next to the intelligent plant . She took the baby from the black woman , who promptly disappeared . Then Cate looked down and saw that , though the bundle was wrapped like a baby , it contained a stuffed teddy bear she had owned as a child . She awoke , her clothes tight and twisted around her body . A motor switched off on the street below . Then there were brisk steps on the stairs and someone knocked at the door . Through the window shades , she could see it was already light . It was Jernigan , freshly shaved , wearing his familiar work pants and plaid shirt . " What time is it ? " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little past seven . I spent the night at the plant . "  | " You mean you did n't go home ? " " No . I worked for a while . I went over the field manager 's reports . Then I took a shower and tried to sleep . " He looked at her rumpled clothes . " You do n't look like you 've slept much , either . " " I slept some , " said honest Cate . " Let 's go out and get some breakfast . I know a diner that 's open on Sunday . I think we should talk . " His voice was low and serious , his countenance grim . She noticed patches of crinkly skin , where all the color had drained out , beneath his eyes . " I need to change my shirt , " she said . He looked her over again and nodded . " Yes , I guess you do . " She took as long as possible in the bathroom , brushing and flossing her teeth , washing her face , putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pinned it up . She had her pride . There had been no need for him to agree with her that she needed freshening up . She removed the crumpled shirt and scrubbed each armpit with soapy , hot water . Then she put on the shirt she had discarded before her bath the evening before . Neither of them spoke much as he drove . The streets of the town were quiet at this hour , but as the Jeep passed a church , Cate saw two men unloading stacks of palm fronds from a florist'struck . It was Palm Sunday . She noted this fact to Jernigan , just to break the silence . " So it is , " he said . " I have n't been to church in years . Hilda goes faithfully every Sunday . When Jody was little , he sometimeswent with her . But he does n't go anymore , either . " He sighed . " It was nice , believing in God . I remember the feeling , as a kid . " " I had a distinct feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was tired of God spying on me all the time . It was a relief to know I was in charge of my life , not God . " He gave her a funny look . " When did you stop believing ? " " Oh , I did n't come to a dead stop till I was in college . But I'dbegun to suspect when I was in this convent school my sister andI went to as children . I was always getting into arguments withp223the nuns , and there was always a certain point where they 'd paint themselves into a corner . One time this nun  --  actually , she was one of the most intelligent  --  and I really got into it , and there was a moment when I saw her face go pale with dread . I 'd made her doubt for a moment . I felt bad about that ; after all , she had given her life to her belief . But it was in college that I became sure that it was entirely up to me : I was entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that freedom and its responsibility ! I felt pretty scared myself till I combined my new belief  --  or rather nonbelief  --  with socialism . That made things cheerier . I 'd do my part and if everybody else would do theirs , we 'd all be architectsof the world 's soul . Which , in a strange way , brings you right back to God . Each person has to be a tiny part of God . Or what we used to think of as God . " Now they were out on the highway , driving past fields that had been freshly turned by the plow . Cate felt better . She soared a little on the wings of her intelligenttestimony : her life did make sense , and she could put it into words . " When did you stop believing ? " she asked cheerfully . " When I was in the Army , I think . I was in Italy . It was in ' forty-three and the Allies were bombing villages left and right . I was with a small detail of men who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if the enemy had got there . The place was deserted . Even after the bombs , you could tell it had never been much . And then one of the men in our detail went berserk . There was this chicken . It came out of a house . He picked it up and just started tearing it to pieces . I do n't mean just wringing its neck . I grew up on a farm . I know how you kill a chicken humanely . But he was tearing it into bloody shreds . About that time I saw an old woman in black . She was looking at us through the window of where her house had been . There was just this one wall left . And everything switched around in me , and I saw that , to her , we were the enemy . We had bombed her house . Now we were tramping through her village , and one of us was tearing her chicken into little pieces , with it still screaming . We were the enemy ; not the enemy we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Up until then I never questioned that we were thep224good guys and God was on our side . Do n't get me wrong . I think we were the good guys in that war . But after that , my simple faith was gone . I still believed in some kind of force , but I was n't so sure whose side he was on . And , like you , I felt more alone after that . More like it was up to me . But I never went in for socialism . That 's not my kind of thing . " " You just believe in taking care of what 's yours . " Cate was irritated with him again . How could he be so intelligent one minute , then short-circuit himself right back into deliberate , provincialignorance the next ? " That 's right , " he said softly . And gave her a look that set her vibrating with ambivalence : she wanted to lean against him , lapse wearily into his care ; she also wanted to press down on the handle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands in her lap and stuck up her chin and narrowed her eyes at the dark , fertile fields that stretched away on either side of them . After they had eaten breakfast , he said , " Let 's go over this thing one more time . You go to Chicago when ? " " Easter Monday . First I let them look me over , then I spend the night at a hotel , then next morning I go back for the ... procedure . I spend another night at the hotel , then I fly back . I 'll have almost a week to take it easy . Then back to my duties at sinking Melanchthon . I 'm luckier than most . Most women have to go back the very next day . " He gave an impatient wave of his hand . " Most women do n't concern me . How far along are you ? " " Ninth week . That 's nothing much , I 'm told . By friends who have been there before . " " And you 've really never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amazing . Not to , all this time , and then now , despite precautions . Damned amazing . " But there was a tinge of male pride in his voice . He covered it up at once , adding humbly , " I 'm truly sorry to have messed you up like this . It was on my mind most ofp225the night . You 're a damned fine woman , Catie  --  excuse me , I mean Cate . Sorry about that , too . " " That was churlish of me last night . It 's just that I 'm touchy about my name . I never liked ' Catherine , ' which was my father 's mother 's name . I never even knew her well  --  she was trodden under completely by the time I was six  --  but even the way other people pronounced her name , ' Catherine , ' had a gloomy , pitying sound to it . I was determined not to be a ' Catherine ' "  --  and Cate rolled her eyes back as she intoned her Christian name . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's the only version of the name that fits me . Not Catherine the martyred wife , or cute little Cathy , or anybody 's Kitty or Catie . Now , my younger sister had it easier . First of all , she was n't named for anybody . Mother and Daddy picked Lydia 's name out of a dictionary . It means ' soft and gentle . ' I guess they realized by then they were going to have enough trouble with me . Also you ca n't chop ' Lydia ' into any silly nickname . Lydia is Lydia . " " And Cate is Cate , " he said . He actually looked pleased by her little diatribe . " Listen , Cate , I want you to do something for me . To ease my conscience . " She lifted her eyebrows . " I 'm putting Jody on the noon flight to Chicago on Friday . From there he goes to LA , to spend the Easter holidays with his mother . I 've given Hilda the Easter weekend off so she can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to batch it out at the castle . But now I 'd like you to join us . Come up and spend that weekend at Rollingstone . I 've seen how you live . I want you to see my life . Would n't that interest you ? To see how Mister Poison lives on his hill ? " " I do n't know . . . . " She frowned . She had n't been prepared for this . Still , the offer was appealing . It appealed especially to her curiosity . And it would be a fitting conclusion to their affair . She owed it to herself in a way : seeing him in his habitat might provide her with some useful perspective on this difficult interludein her life . She ought to learn from her mistakes . " I could pick you up at your place on Friday , " he went on ,  | " after I take Jody to the airport and see him off . Then , I can either take you back to your place or straight to the airport for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countdown hours with you , since you wo n't let me contribute anything else . " Cate thought for a minute . Somehow , she did n't like the idea of being trapped in his habitat without her car . " I 'll tell you what , " she said . " I 'll drive to your castle . I 'll come up on Friday afternoon , and then I 'll leave early Monday morning . But I 'll need a map . Is that okay ? " " It will have to be , wo n't it ? " he replied , studying her with thoughtful amusement for a moment . " All right , I 'd better take what I can get . " He unclipped a ball-point pen from his shirt pocket , took a paper napkin from the dispenser , and , with an obviousrelish for the map-drawing process , traced in hard , sure strokes the road that led up the Mississippi River to Rollingstone . Cate was no stranger to castles . When she and Pringle were at Ruislip , they had spent many weekends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iceland , they once flew to Copenhagen , rented a car , and drove up the coast to Elsinore , where she had broken one of her heels while creeping through the dungeons of Hamlet 's castle . In her hometown there were two bona fide castles . They were both on the mountain that overlooked the town . One was a sinister gray-stone fortress , surrounded by a tall spiked fence , inside which , it was rumored , German spies posing as the owner 's houseguests operated a signalstation in World War II . Now it was owned by an ex-ballet dancer who had turned it into an exclusive restaurant which cateredto private parties only . The other castle was a friendly yellow-brickone , which sat right out in the sunshine ; but it had the requisite number of battlements and turrets and even a moat . During Cate 's teens , after its businessman owner and builder had died , this empty castle had been the place for parking ; she and her dates had driven over the rattly moat bridge and pulled in beside the next car in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooking the twinkling lights of town . That castle was now a business college . So , as she drove upriver on Good Friday , Jernigan 's papernapkinmap on the seat beside her ( though , so far , she had had only to follow the river road ) , she did not expect to be surprised too much by the actual lineaments of her lover 's home . She had a pretty good idea of what it would be like , give or take a turret or a moat or a battlement . The thing about American castles , poor things , was that they were , by nature , a little hoaxy . They were the harmless decorative descendants of an institution that had been constructed from grim realities : the people who had shelteredinside the real castles had done so because there were peopleoutside willing to cut their throats in order to steal their hard-won positions and possessions . The people inside knew this all too well because , not long before , they had been outside , sharpening their knives to cut the throats of others and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " What were aristocrats but simply the barbarians who got there first ? " Mother had her points . Cate drove through the old lumbering town of Clinton . She had been up this far before , having once come here to climb the bluffs to a city park which provided a wonderful view of the Mississippi . Here the river was about two miles wide . The bluffs were becoming steeper and lighter in color : enormous sheer drops of limestone , as perpendicular in places as if they had been masonry . To think that once there had been a time when the water was on a level with the tops of these walls ! The idea was strangely restful . It depersonalized her finite agonizings , to be able to remind herself that her perishable body would be outlivedby many more centuries by these mute , grand bluffs . That is , unless some idiot , acting on orders , pushed the button . But , either way , she was secure in the promise of her own eventual personal extinction . And having canceled herself out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was looking forward intensely to whatevershe would find at Roger Jernigan 's castle.  |p228She  was upon it almost before she was prepared . " Just after the toll bridge , " he had said , " turn left at the old stone warehouse . Then you go up , up , up , almost to the top of the hill , and turn left again into the private drive . That 's us . " He had sketched two short left turns on the paper napkin , but she had expected the approach to be lengthier in reality . Within minutes of turningoff the river road and urging her car in low gear up an incline she would n't care to confront in snow or ice , she was completing the curve of gravel driveway that ended abruptly in a retaining wall into which a two-car garage had been built . An arched stairwaythrough the wall led to the next level above . Cate , from her car , could glimpse a sweep of lawn , still recovering from winter , and , above that , the castle . Its proportions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size as a three-story house  --  but its architecture was that of a castle . It had four square towers , two at the front and two at the back , and the whole top of the building was notched with battlements . Except for some large modern windows , obviously recent renovations , and a connecting balcony joining the two tower rooms on the second floor , the structure looked like a child 's drawing of a castle . Jernigan , in Levi 's and a red sweater , appeared above the retaining wall . " Well , you got here , " he observed gruffly . " Look what nice weather you 've brought , too . Uncommonly nice , for this time of year . " But he looked ill at ease and wary . Had he , in the interim , regretted inviting her ? " The weather is lovely , " agreed Cate , slamming the door of her VW , " but I can only take credit for bringing myself . " She had n't meant it to sound so threatening ; she guessed she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did make a difference . " Well , I hope you at least brought an overnight bag . Did n't you ? " He sounded worried . Maybe he thought she had changed her mind about spending the weekend , and would drive off again after supper . " So I did . " She opened the door again and ducked into thep229backseat and swung out her faithful brown English suitcase , the twin of which Lydia had . He was down through the wall 's staircase in a second . " Here , give me that , " he ordered . His alarm was rather comic . It made her remember for the first time in at least an hour that she was pregnant . He was obviously thinking of it , too , because his eyes swept over her body in a searching , tender way . " Welcome to Rollingstone , " he said . " Was my map okay ? " " I did n't get lost a single time . " She followed him up the tunneled stone stairway . " It 's a lovely drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her cheerful , " social " voice bounced back at her from the limestone walls . They surfaced on the lawn , which sloped left , toward a magnificentview of the river , spanned by the bridge she had driven past just a few minutes ago . About thirty feet from them stood a rocklike blond man , tending a barbecue pit . He was dressed identically to Jernigan , in Levi 's and the same red sweater . His back was to them . " Come meet Sunny , " said Jernigan . " Then I 'll show you where your room is . " Somehow she had assumed she would be sharing his room . The blond man heard his father 's voice . He turned to watch them approach ; He was not beautiful , like Jody , but he had pleasant , clean-cut features . His eyes were green , like Jernigan 's , but they were rounder and not as shrewd . It was hard to believe he was thirty-three . His countenance had the smooth , unfinished surface of a boy 's . Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep double-slash of frown lines between the eyes , his face had no other signs of aging . His body was hard and knotty , like a weight lifter 's . He watched Cate come toward him with the unembarrassedstare of a child . " This is Sunny , my elder son , " said Jernigan . " Sunny , this is Cate , Jody 's teacher . " " Hello , Cate ! " responded Sunny with a great deal of enthusiasm , as if he had been primed.  | " I 'm so glad to meet you . At last . " Cate stuck out her hand , but Sunny ignored it . " Remember the night Jody rehearsed his song about the corn borer ? " said Jernigan . " Well , that was for his class with Cate , at the college . " He spoke to the other man with a patience Cate had never heard him use before . " Yes , I remember , " said Sunny . He turned back to the barbecuepit . " Roger , the coals are ready . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , son . I 'm going to take Cate up to her room now . Maybe she 'd like to wash or unpack . Then you and I can cook the steaks . " " She 's going to sleep in Jody 's room , " said Sunny , looking from his father to Cate . " That 's right , " replied Jernigan . To Cate , he said , " It has the best view , and the most rugs and mirrors . Jody made it up for you himself before he left this morning . " " I want to go , too , " said Sunny , bouncing up and down on the balls of his sneakers . " Can I go , too ? " " Sure you can , " said Jernigan . " Here , take her bag and run on up to Hilda 's rooms . You wait for us there . " Looking as if he had been granted a great favor , Sunny took the brown suitcase from his father and sprinted off across the lawn to the castle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were constantly being distracted from his path . " He 's excited today , " said Jernigan , taking Cate 's arm . " I do n't often have people up here . But I 've told him who you are . I 've prepared him for your visit . He 's used to routine . He thrives on it . As long as he knows what 's going to happen and what 's expected of him , he 's fine . He 's very helpful , too . He helps Hilda with heavy cleaning ; he does all the yardwork . He was wonderful when Jody was small . Tied his shoes , dressed him ; then taught him to do it for himself . He was always carrying Jody around on his back , till you thought of them as some double-headed animal . His mind . . . it has its own special way of arranging things . One minute he 'll seem oblivious to what 's happening around him . The next , why , he 's telling you details of things you 've for/gotten , things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wait , he 'll be able to remind you of things about this day that you 'd hardly noticed yourself . " Cate felt very sad , both because she now understood the secretof Sunny and because , not only did she not know where she was going to be in five years , but she doubted she would ever meet such a solid , comforting man again . " He 's a very likable person , " she felt she should say . " He has so much  --  so much energy . " " He has that , all right , " said Jernigan with a sigh . " He has to take medication or he 'd go off like a rocket . Yes , he 's a likable , affectionate boy . And nice to look at , in his way . I mean , he 's not  --  it could have been worse . Although I did n't think so when we first found out . We did n't know anything was wrong till he was three . We thought he was just a slow developer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved into the house next door , and we got to worrying about the difference between Sunny and him . We took him for tests . We got the news . My wife went to pieces . She felt it was her fault because one specialist said it might have been caused by a too-rapid exit from the birth passage . The oxygen get cuts off , see . Poor Selma had a bad time . For a while there , she was more of a problem than Sunny . But you gradually accept these things . " He laughed harshly . " What else can you do ? Then the rationalizing games set in . In some ways that 's the worst part . ' Maybe it wo n't be too bad . Maybe he 'll grow out of it . ' And the doctors do n't know everything , either . They encourage you to ' wait and see . ' Especially when it 's a borderline case , like Sunny . If you 've got the means to do it , you go around buying the theories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best . I was fortunate enough to be on my feet pretty well by the time he needed schools . He could have the best . He was away at a boarding school for a while , a good place . Organized like a little community . The big ones take care of the little ones and the ... less damaged take care of the more damaged . But Sunny 's happiest at home . I made the decision to bring Sunny home when Jody was two , and I never regretted it . Jody loves his brother more than he loves any/body in the world . And Sunny takes such a pride in Jody . He tells Jody he 's his bodyguard , and hangs on Jody 's every word , and is always surprising him with gifts . Sunny 's made Jody a better person . He 's made me a better person . " Jernigan stopped and turned to Cate . " He 'll always have the mind of a child . But I 'll tell you something . I could n't have said this thirty years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the choice of Sunny never existing , or him existing exactly as he is now , I would choose to have him . Can you understand that ? " " Yes , I can , " said Cate . " Good . " He put his arm lightly around her and they continuedtoward the castle . " That 's enough about that . I want you to enjoy your weekend . Make yourself at home . By the way , I ought to warn you , Jody prepared a little surprise for you . " " Why should you warn me ? " " Because . He meant for it to scare you . In an amusing way , of course , but "  --  he glanced significantly at her stomach  --  " you should n't be scared too much . " " I do n't scare easily , " retorted Cate good-humoredly , addingbefore she had time to think better of it , " Besides , so what ? It would save me a trip to Chicago . " Jernigan flinched . " Anyway , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open the door to his room . " " I 'm surprised you told him I was coming , " she said , feeling his rebuff . All right , so the remark had been crude , she wished she had n't made it , but what right had he to be offended . Did he take it as a slight against " what was his , " even when they both knew she was going to dispose of it on Tuesday ? " He would have heard it from Sunny . I try and make the most of my opportunities for candor with Jody . In hopes that he 'll be equally candid with me . " They found Sunny pacing restlessly up and down in Hilda 's " Parlor , " which was awful . It reminded Cate of some of the most stifling " formal " rooms in the Hapsburg Palace , through which she and Pringle had dutifully dragged themselves , both halfdeadfrom a bout with food poisoning but not wanting to missp233the highlights of Vienna . Now her throat began to close on her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her old claustrophobia , which attacked whenever she knew she was going to have to stay in a place that made her feel trapped . Could she get through one night here ? Things were already off to a less than ideal start , thanks to her careless remark . But if she were to leave , would n't Jernigan take it to mean she was fleeing Sunny , that she found him depressing , poor Sunny who was at the momentproudly reciting an inventory of Hilda 's dreadful furnishings ? Jernigan had been right : Sunny 's memory for details was prodigious . He remembered which pieces had been bought at which auctions , and he seemed particularly urgent about having her know which things they had brought with them from their other home , the one they 'd lived in before Roger  --  as Sunny alwayscalled his father  --  bought the castle . It was both sad and thought-provoking that his brain , though damaged , retained these specialized circuits through which past images and information  --  unadulteratedby any of the abstractions and conceptionsthat the healthy mind delighted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought she had just had , for instance . And so she took herself in hand and breathed deeply and said , " Oh yes , " when Sunny asked if she 'd like to " peek " into Hilda 's bedroom ; she exclaimed suitably over the canopied monster of a bed , complete with faded rose satin hangings . With tassels . " It makes Hilda happy " was Jernigan 's quiet comment . He had been watching Cate . As he led the way upstairs , he called back to Sunny , " We want to keep Hilda happy , do n't we , son ? We 'd be in a sad fix without her , would n't we ? " " We 'd be in a sad fix ! " Sunny called back , laughing hilariously . Cate had forgotten Jernigan 's warning about Jody 's " surprise , " and let out a shriek when she entered his room , where she was to sleep . Suspended from the ceiling was Jody 's voluminous Draculap234cloak from the college production . Handpainted cardboard hands with long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cloak . The hands held a sign lettered in Gothic script : WELCOME , DR . GALITSKY ( HEH , HEH ) TO : DRACULA 'S BEDROOMHer shriek set Sunny off again . His delighted laughter infectedJernigan , who lost his thoughtful scowl for the first time since the lawn . Then Sunny had to recite the history of the cape . When Hilda had bought the eight yards of black velvet and the seven and a half yards of purple satin , and how , while sewing the cape , she had bunched the satin in the sewing machine and cried for a whole hour . " Here , you want to see where she bunched up the satin ? " He started pawing through the yards of cape . " Come on , son , " said Jernigan . " Let 's let Cate get settled . You and I have things to do downstairs . " To Cate he said , " Will you be warm enough if we eat outside ? He likes it . It will be the first opportunity we 've had this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just say the word . " " Of course I wo n't be cold . Besides , I brought my heavy sweater . It 'll be much more fun to eat outside . " " Good . You 'll be okay here ? Not too much fluff and foolishnessfor you ? " He glanced around with wry forbearance at his younger son 's room . " I revel in fluff and foolishness . On occasion . " Their eyes met . Good humor had been reinstated between them . " You take as long as you like , " he said , brushing her arm lightly with his fingers . " We 'll be getting things set up down-stairs . " Alone , Cate unpacked her few things . There was no reason for her to feel pity for Jernigan . As he had said himself , it could have been much worse . It was a luxury to allow herself to pity Jernigan . His situation was rich and picturesque enough to makep235it a comfortable area for pity . " See how the mighty are fallen "  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the happy , attractiveface of the victim ; and steaks on the grill . If Jernigan had been a poor man  --  if he had been , say , the real handyman she had first mistaken him for at the college  --  and had dragged into her office one day his retarded son , a son maybe not so nice to look at as Sunny , she would have felt the real pity , the kind that is so painful that you want to dissociate yourself from it . Jody 's bedroom was rife with fluff and foolishness . But it was luxurious to the senses , with its sinfully thick white rugs , and amusing in a campy sort of way . She went to the window to make sure it could be opened . It could . Down below , the two men in their look-alike outfits were carrying out a table . It looked like the dining-room table . She stood back , out of sight , and listened to them discussing the best place to put the table . " Do you think Cate would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask his father . His voice , high-pitched for a man 's , floated up to her through the brisk , late-afternoon air . Beyond and below them , the river curved . She felt a bit like a medieval princess , looking out of her tower room at the pleasing , distant vistas of Illinois , which from here appeared a soft , indistinctblue . Then she reminded herself that she was not a medievalprincess , nor did she want to be , and , come Monday , she would be crossing that river to do a very modern thing in Illinois . Jody 's bathroom was carpeted in thick purple . As Cate washed her face , redid her hair , and performed other necessary functions , she found it rather disconcerting to be unable to lose sight of herself for a minute . While sitting on the purple toilet seat and shyly averting her eyes from her seated reflection on the opposite wall , she counted forty-three mirrors , ranging from the big one she was trying to avoid to little ones the size of a magnifyingglass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapes of hearts . She chose to think that Jody meant them partly as a parody of his own beauty . Dear Jody . Accepting the burden of the Drama class , she had rationalized that , at least , it might lead to a new experience , and so it had.  |p236They  dined in sweaters , in a patch of late sun , off a mahoganytable that would have seated ten ; its thick legs sank progressivelyinto the turf as they cut their steaks . There was a rich potato salad ( a little too rich ) , homemade bread , and a chocolate sponge cake for dessert  --  all prepared in advance by the faithful Hilda before she departed for Waterloo . Cate was obliged to undo the button on her jeans discreetly before the end of the meal . Whenever a barge or a boat of any kind passed on the river , Sunny sprang from his chair and followed its progress through a costly-looking telescope which had been set up on a tripod . He called for Cate and his father to come and look , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He never tires of the river traffic , " said Jernigan . " And we 've lived here almost six years now . You are n't getting chilled , are you ? " " I 'm fine . " She smiled at him . " I 'm very fine . I feel very secureand relaxed . " He reached for her hand and stroked it between his two . " Good . That 's the general idea . " Suddenly she felt sorrowful that this lovely security would end on Monday . " Cate ? " " What ? " God , she really liked this man . " Could you stand watching a movie ? " He stroked each of her fingers , as if he wanted to learn each one of them . " He always has a Friday-night movie . It 's a sort of tradition . " " I 'd love a movie , then . What 's playing ? " " The Magnificent Seven . It 's one of his favorites . Come on , now . Are you sure ? A cowboy movie ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your room . I could join you later . " " No , I want to watch The Magnificent Seven . I remember liking it . Can we hold hands in the dark ? " He laced his fingers through hers and held their two hands aloft , as if they were the referee and the winner of a boxing match . " We can hold hands in front of the whole damn world , " he said , grinning . Then he stood up and released her hand . " Son ,  |p237I  'm going down to set up the projector , " he called to Sunny at the telescope . " You and Cate can clear things , but do n't you two try to move that table . It 's too heavy for Cate . " Sunny showed Cate where to put things in Hilda 's kitchen , which was as admirable a room as Hilda 's living quarters had been impossible . Cate could n't help thinking that Lydia would adore this kitchen . There was a restaurant-sized gas range , an enormous butcher-block chopping table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gang war . Metal and porcelainsurfaces shone ; storage shelves groaned with portly reserves . Every inch of space was immaculately ordered . Cate felt the absenthousekeeper peering jealously over her shoulder as she spooned the leftover potato salad back into the see-through containerlabeled SALAD FOR STEAK . All of the containers in the refrigeratorwere labeled with explicit directions : HEAT FOR 30 MIN . AT 350 . PREHEAT OVEN ! or SALAD FOR COLD CHICKEN . It was obvious that Hilda did not expect them to get along very well without her . Had Jernigan told her that he was having a woman spending Easter weekend here ? Would Hilda return and frown when she detected an alien touch in the way Saran Wrap was crinkled over the remains of the sponge cake ? During the movie , there were two phone calls for Jernigan . He took the first call leisurely , from his comfortable armchair beside Cate 's . " Yeah , my son and a friend and myself are down in the gym watching a movie . " He went on to speak in an easy , friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target-siteinsensitivity " and " benefit/cost ratios . " When he hung up he was in a mellow mood and retrieved her hand and laid it on the arm of his chair and began playing with it some more . She was aroused and so was he . But Sunny had to have his movie , even though he was not exactly glued to the screen . At frequent intervals , he would spring restlessly from his chair and go over to the Universal equipment and do some chest lifts , or raise himself by the arms and hang in midair while he watched the movie for a while . When the second phone call came , Jernigan mumbledp238cautious monosyllables into the receiver . Then he said , " Let me take this on another phone . " He asked Cate to hang up when she heard him pick up on the other end and left the room with an exasperated sigh . " Okay , Kevin , I 'll explain my position one more time , " she heard him say when he came on the line . She hung up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to " defuse , " as his father put it . Jernigan went upstairs to Sunny 's quarterson the third floor while Cate undressed slowly in Dracula 's bedroom . When Jernigan had returned to the movie after the call from " Kevin , " he had slipped her a note on a piece of memopadpaper which had the logo of a smiling sun and Sunny Enterprises/ " We make your garden grow " / herbicides , insecticides , crop spraying at the top . Cate , wearing her nightgown , sat down on Jody 's bed and curled her toes in the thick white rug and reread the note in Jernigan'sbrusque scrawl . Gentleman residing in North tower room desires tryst with Lady in South tower room . If agreeable , please answer to three clandestine knocks on Lady 's door leading to balcony . She had not expected him to have such a delightful sense ofromantic occasion . She had not expected the awakening of thisvigorous lust in herself , either . She sat there , among the fin desiecle ruffles and clutter of Jody 's harem lamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beardsley poster of theChevalier Tannhauser ( who looked a lot like Jody , with his capeand floating hair ) , and tried to figure it out . Why this lust now ? Why here ? Was her body trying to trick her into some kind oftrap ? Or were these surroundings arousing the atavistic female inher who wanted to receive the Dracula bite from her man so shecould lie down forever within the protection of his castle walls ? " Oh shut up , Cate , " she said , " quit philosophizing . Giveyourself up to temporary lust and theater . See this weekend forwhat it is ; his doing his ceremonious best to salve his guilt byp239making you feel appreciated , before sending you off alone to do what you have to do on Tuesday . " And so , when the " three clandestine knocks " came at the door leading to her balcony , she opened to him , prepared to continue the playful fantasy he had set up in his note . But she found herself being crushed to the breast of a groaning man wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he murmured angrily , his voice muffled in the curve of her neck . " Dammit , we deserve some happiness , too . " She let herself be pressed , enfolded . He ground himself against her as though he were trying to escape into her . His urgencywas contagious . She wanted it , too . She was tired of being conscious and witty and responsible . She wanted to get down to basics , to take and be taken . Nevertheless , she was surprised when she heard something like a growl escape from herself . " Let 's go to my room , " he said hoarsely . " Jody 's feathers give me hay fever . " He led her outside , across the balcony connecting the two rooms . A big moon lit up the curling river and the grounds below . The nippy air made her skin tingle under her gown . Oh hell , she thought , why could n't this be the thirteenth century ? Then it would all be decided for me . And in the dark of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too easy to abandon her modernity , to give herself up to basics . She was his female and he was her male . They knotted themselves together , struggling and clinging for a total closeness , a self-obliterating closeness . They were connected utterly in intention , and by something more . Already inside her was the tiny life they had created together . What else was necessary ? What on earth was the rest of the fuss about ? Why not go back to this , stay inside this , get rid of that nervous , worrying self ? And if , at that moment , someone had pushed forward a document ( " Do you hereby sign away all your troublesome , thought-provoking rights to your unclear and insecure future ? Do you , by placing your signature on the dotted line , pledge yourself to care for , and be cared for by , this male creature whop240is reducing you to your essential female creatureness ? " ) , she would have signed . And her sense of honor would have made her stick to it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worrying , worrisome , sometimes female and sometimes androgynous self . She would have signed . And stuck to it . Well , probably . She would question herself afterward : if he had asked her , there in the moonlit room , after they had tried and almost ( but not quite ) obliterated their modern selves ; if he had struggled hard , back into the land of words , just enough to ask her .. . what he would ask her on the next afternoon  --  might she not have said yes , and sealed her fate as a happy woman ? But instead they fell asleep , still connected , having renouncedeverything outside . She was safely walled away from her past , and from Chicago , and from whatever came after Chicago . He , buried close to the life he had helped to engender inside her , was out of reach , for the time being , of the guilts and responsibilities he had set in motion , many of which were time bombs , due to go off in their own separate hours of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the three of them drove up to Bellevue , to a state park on a rocky promontoryhigh above the river . At Sunny 's instigation , they sang Jody 's " Pore Little Corn Bore " song , delighting Sunny each time he had to supply someone with a line . He knew the song perfectly . They consumed Hilda 's sumptuous ( labeled ) picnic , having to weight things down with rocks to keep the wind from blowing them away . After lunch , Sunny went off to explore the trails he knew from other picnics here , and the " adults " relaxed against a warm , friendly rock , absorbing the sunshine and the view of the river . " Does Sunny ever have . . . girl friends ? " Cate asked . " In what sense do you mean ? " Jernigan sounded defensive . " Does he ever have girls come to visit him ? " She was remembering the gossip from her friend Ann , who said Jody hadp241told her he could n't do his exam because he had to pick up some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should ask that . He did have a friend , from his old boarding school . She came out here sometimes . Melanie would be thirty-four now . I wonder what she 's doing these days . " He closed his eyes and tilted his face up toward the sun . " It did n't work out like everybody hoped , but , hell , you ca n't mate people like animals . The young people sensed we were trying to corral them and they were n't having any . You know , they call people like Sunny and Melanie ' subnormal , ' but there are times when I think they 've developed finer senses , when it comes to feeling , than we have . " " What happened ? " " Well , I met her parents , on a visiting weekend at the school . This was when they were just children , Sunny and Melanie . Melanie was the adopted child of this couple . They could n't have any of their own . Some people have rotten luck , do n't they ? But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did with us , they did n't know until she was several years old  --  they determined to do everything they could for her . Like me , they were able to afford the best school , the ninety-nine thousandconsultations with ' specialists . ' We were all so pleased about it , when we saw how well our two kids got along . So we encouraged them to keep in touch after they left the school . I used to help Sunny write his letters to Melanie , and her mother , I 'm sure , wrote Melanie 's letters to Sunny . " He took Cate 's hand , stroking it absently but possessively as he talked . " Sunny visited Melanie , and Melanie came out here to see Sunny . This went on for fifteen years . They played like two children  --  it was touching to see it , even though they were n't physically wife were getting on in years and he was afraid if somethinghappened to them Melanie would have no one to love her and look after her as they had . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some community they have there . The Swedes are damn smart . People like Sunny and Melanie can marry and livep242in this community . But that was in Sweden . Melanie 's father wanted to set up something here for our kids . What he proposed was that he would settle an old-fashioned ' dowry ' on his daughterand entrust it to me . Then Melanie and Sunny could marry and live here . Hilda could teach Melanie how to do the things she 's always done for Sunny , and I 'd have myself a sweet , docile daughter to care for me in my old age . Well , I was n't too keen on that angle , but I decided to consult Sunny on the marriage part . And Melanie 's father consulted her . Then she flew out for the ' betrothal visit , ' I guess you could call it , and it was awful . They 'd lost their freedom around each other . They were nervous and embarrassed . Melanie had shrieking spells and we had to put her on the plane home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh God , " said Cate . And she confided to him what she had thought ; that Sunny was some kind of wastrel playboy who had women flown in for his pleasure . He laughed bitterly . " I 'm aware people have strange ideas . I do n't discourage them . For one thing , it 's none of their damn business . For another , Jody is extremely protective of Sunny . He 'd rather people think there 's something mysterious and leave it at that . " " But did Sunny and Melanie  --  no , I should n't ask that . " " I know what you 're going to ask . I honestly do n't know , myself . I did n't spy on them . All the more power to them if they did , but I think they mostly just cuddled a lot . Sunny is n't all that interested in sex . He likes to work out , and he can ski fairly well , but he is n't highly sexed . That 's often the case , you know . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melanie 'd been sterilized . Some town boys tried to get at her once , and that was enough for her father . " " Oh God . Why is there so much sorrow in the world ? " She crouched against him and closed her eyes as if to blot it out . He put his arms around her . He kissed her forehead , her nose , each of her cheeks . " It 's not all sorrow . Is this , right now , sorrow ? Was last night sorrow ? When we were together ? "  | " No . " She kissed him back , kiss for kiss , forehead , nose , and cheeks . " It was a lovely postponement , that 's what . " " Listen , Cate . Look at me . Do n't you know why I asked you here this weekend ? " She looked at him and of course she knew . Once again , she felt schizoid in his presence : she wanted to run away as fast as she could , and she wanted to curl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? " He prodded her relentlessly with his sharp green eyes . Cate hung her head , like a maiden . " Now , listen . Do n't interrupt till I 've finished . I 'm fifty-five years old . I 'm in pretty good shape . You 've seen that I have a responsibility to Sunny . But , so far , I 've been able to meet my responsibilities . Unless all the Furies turn on me at once , I 'll be able to go on meeting them . Even if I get hit with a rash of lawsuits . This Kevin , the pilot who called last night , is trying to get me to settle out of court . They 've had another baby that 's normal and he just wants to go somewhere and start over and for me to contribute fifteen thousand to his new future and pay his lawyer . I told him I could n't , I had to tell him that . So , what I think you ought to do is call this Chicago clinic first thing Monday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on and have that child . And I 'd like to marry you . " " Oh , Roger , I appreciate it . I really do . " " Wait a minute . Do n't you believe I 'm serious ? This is n't some kind of courtesy offer . I thought this whole thing out . More seriously than I thought out my other marriages , in fact . I 'll admit , I did n't plan to marry again . I had everything nicely separated . My work at the plant , which I love , by the way , if it were n't for all these crippling restrictions . I will . not apologize for being in toxicology . It 's a science , not a crime . And I had the boys and Hilda up here . I had women , occasionally ; I like the company of women . When you told me your news last Saturday , I was n't prepared , at first , but then I drove out to the plant and thought about it . The more I thought about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us teenagers anymore . But we 're notp244old , by a long shot . We could have quite a good time together . I know you 'd be good for me . You know things I do n't know . And I know things you do n't know . I flatter myself I 'd be good for you . " " You would . I know that , but  --  " " But what ? You would n't have to be stuck up at the castle , if that 's what you 're worried about . I know you like your independence . We could have a nurse for the baby . Hell , what 's my money for ? And there 'd be Hilda . And Sunny is wonderful with children , he 's already proved that with Jody . You could travel with me . I 'd like that . I have to go places all the time . Especially now that this business is changing so much . In June , I have a big Integrated Pest Management conference in Switzerland . Ever been to Switzerland ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I just was n't prepared for this , Roger . " Cate was growing alarmed . He spoke as if , having thought it all out , it was as good as done . " So ? I 'm preparing you now . Only , we better get started pretty soon , because of ... circumstances . " He glanced down at her stomach . " I 'll be forty in June . The chances of a woman my age havinga child that 's not  --  " " Already checked into that . You can have a test done in another month . Even if you were twenty , I 'd want you to have it done . After what I 've been through with Sunny . If there 's something the matter with the baby , we 'll make you another appointment . But not at some damned impersonal clinic . " " And then you 'd be stuck with just me , " she joked . " Ca n't think of anybody I 'd rather be stuck with . That 's thetruth , Catie ... Cate . You liked last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's something I had to be sure of . " " Oh , Sunny 's fine  --  " " But ? " He sounded the slightest bit annoyed . He had offeredher everything he had . What more did she want ? What more did she want ? She looked away from him , across the curving river , at the trees and farmlands and houses on the Illinois side . That was the trouble . She could n't think of whatp245more she did want , she could only know what she did n't want . But how could you tell a man like Roger Jernigan that , though y.ou knew your life was not perfect , your hopes for the future lay in keeping a space ready for what you did want , even though you did n't know what it would be until it came . She knew how that would sound to a man like him . " It would be an escape , " she tried to explain . " A lovely escape , but  --  I do n't want to escape my history . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they sounded ponderous , a little pretentious . " I do n't see how marrying me would interfere with your history , " he reasoned humorously . " That 's in the past , is n't it ? " " I mean my future history , as well , " she amended lamely . " The whole pattern of my life , as it defines me . What I am , what I 'm meant to be . The thing is , I know it would be good with you , but  --  " She saw Sunny 's head cresting the promontory ; he was returning to them from his climbing expedition . How could she convey to this man how much his offer had touched her , tempted her , honored her , yet also make him see why , outside of a storybook , it would be doomed to failure ? " I would feel as if I had retiredfrom the struggle without having finished facing it . " Two more heads appeared . Sunny had picked up two companions , adolescent boys . " Hell , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have that myself . I assure you , we 'll have our share of struggle . Unless you mean some esoteric kind of thing I 'm too stupid to understand . " He had seen Sunny and the boys , too . He stood up abruptly , brushing off the seat of his pants . " Well , give it some thought , at least . You 've got till Monday morning . Will you do that for me ? " She owed him that . " I 'll do it , of course , but  --  " Brusquely , he waved off anything else she was about to say and went to meet Sunny and his new friends . There followed an awkward scene , unpleasant for everybody . It had happened many times before , judging from Jernigan 's carefully friendly attitudetoward the two young boys : Sunny had often befriended people much younger than himself who had at first been flat/tered ; then , after being with Sunny for a while , they would begin to sense that this big , cheerful , muscular man who was pretending to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their inferior . The new friends would become increasingly patronizing and then bored and impatient to get away . Sunny 's present friends must have reached this point when Sunny had dragged them back to meet his father . Jernigan asked them where they lived and , when he found out they lived in the town , asked what their fathers did . One father was in the Coast Guard ; the other father " lived somewhere else . " Jernigan asked the boys what the cost of an ice cream was , these days . They told him , and , within seconds , each disappeared down the path between the rocks with thirty-five cents . On the drive back , Sunny wanted to know , once more , exactlywhen Jody would be back . Then he asked his father if he could join the Coast Guard . Jernigan said , " No , son , we need you too much at the castle . " Sunny nodded , as if he expected this answer . Then Sunny wanted them to sing all the verses of the Corn Bore song again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to do my thingBut Mister Poison in the Sky Has it in for me ... they sang , Sunny happily from the backseat , Jernigan pensively at the wheel of the Jeep , Cate with determined enthusiasm while staring out the window and trying to imagine her life as Mrs. Roger Jernigan . She pictured herself sleeping late and then , dressed in an expensive maternity wrap ( which Jody would have picked out for her ) , descending into the kitchen to ask Hilda ( tactfully ) not to put quite so much sour cream in the potato salad ; she saw herself get out her embroidery again and work on a tapestry she had once planned to make when she and Pringle were in Iceland that long , dark winter : it was going to be a crewel tapestry representing all biological life , starting with simple , col/orful fishes at the bottom and working up to a row of blithe , graceful Blakean figures which would represent what men and women could be . She saw herself in June , visibly pregnant , her amniotic fluids having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanying her husband via Swissair to an Integrated Pest Management Conference . While you sat on your hillAnd counted your moneyAnd said what we could and could n't do , All us lepidoptera down belowWere outevolving you . That night , for the first time , Jernigan was impotent with her . They lay in the dark talking about his lawsuit problem . " The trouble is , with this fad for suing , if I were to pay Kevin off , every man who had ever worked for me , every pilot who had ever sprayed for me , the next time anything in his life went wrong  --  his wife miscarried , he developed a wart or a rash  --  it would be my fault . I have nothing against Kevin , but nothing has been proved . I frankly do n't know myself whether the chemicals in my spray made that hole in his first child 's heart . I 'd be more than willing to help Kevin out with a loan , if only he had n't gone and sued . Do you think I should pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He seemed a little disappointed when Cate said no , that if it had n't been proved , then he would be asking for more lawsuits , probably . They lay in silence for a while . Cate imagined how , as his wife , she would have to take on the burden of his conscience . The burden of her own was a full-time job . They would lie here ( or in some other room which would be hers , which she could decorate in any way she liked  --  with plenty of advice from Jody , no doubt ) , and , on the nights when they did not make love , they would lie next to each other , companionably discussing the slipperymoral crevices in the terrain of toxicology.  |p248On  the night of Easter Sunday , she lay in his arms and cried herself into hysterics . He soothed her and fathered her . At last he gave up and tried humor . " It 's asking a lot , is n't it , Cate , to want me to console you for leaving me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made love , not passionately , but with determined goodwill on the part of each . He even left his reading lamp on . His room was the most undecorated in the castle . She lay beside him , afterward , approving of its starkness , while he stroked her head . She closed her eyes gratefully and , after a while , he must have assumed she was asleep , for he put on his reading glasses and leafed through the current issue of the Journal of Economic Entomology . Several times she peeked up at him ; it was like watching him going on with his life after she had gone . The next morning they breakfasted together , while Sunny worked out on the floor below . They ate in silence , listening to the thuds and clanks of the various body-building instruments as Sunny made his daily rounds on the Universal . Her plane to Chicago would leave shortly before noon . " You do n't want to take the river road back , " he said . " Here , you like maps . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airport . What you want to do is get on Sixty-four at the bridge , then go south on Sixty-one at a town called Maquoketa . Too bad you wo n't have time to see their archaeologicalmuseum . It 's probably closed on Easter Monday , anyway . The Indians around there used to bury their dead in trees , and there 's a piece of elm with an arm bone in it . Sixty-one will take you right down to Eighty , which is what you want for the airport . " " Thank you for the weekend , " she said , taking the map and putting it in her purse . " I 'll always remember it . " " I expect I will , too . You know you can always call me if you need me , do n't you ? " " I know . " They both knew she would not be calling . " Well , Jody will be disappointed . " " You mean you told him ? " " Just that I was thinking about asking you to marry me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the go-ahead . He thought it was a great idea . He likes you . " " I 'm sorry if I raised false hopes . " " No harm done . It appealed to his imagination . And he probably thought it would make it easier for me when he left . He 's got to go soon . He 's got to make his own way . " " Yes .... " She wanted to go . This was getting painful for both of them . " So what will you do , come June ? " He watched her with interest , but not so much personal , she thought , as scientific : what would a stubborn , esoteric creature like herself do next ? " I 'll look for another job , I guess . I 'll look for ... whatever comes next . " " Well , that 's sure to come . I hope you like it , whatever it is . " He put a hand on each of her shoulders , looked her in the eye , kissed her firmly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good-bye , Roger . " She grimaced , to keep back the tears . " Come on , " he said . " Smile , for Sunny 's sake . Let 's go down and tell him good-bye . If he asks when you 're coming back , would you mind saying something like , you hope you 'll see him again sometime ? He would n't understand if you said never . It upsets him when people come into his life and then go out . " " It upsets me , too . " " Well , it 's your choice , baby . " On the inland route Jernigan had marked for her to the airport , Cate counted three billboards advertising his company . Three times she passed the simple scene of early morning in rural America , under a bluer-than-blue sky , where every ear of corn grew straight and perfect as its neighbor and in every little farmhouse you could imagine a family eager to finish breakfast and go out and reap the blessings of the day . And hovering above this idyllic guarantee : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ENTERPRISES . ( The company had been founded and named by Jernigan only a few months before they had decided to consult the first of the " ninety-nine thousand " specialists about the disturbingly slow progress of the firstborn son. )  |p250Cate  wondered if he had planned it this way . That she would have to make her getaway past these billboards which remindedher , like silently chiding sentinels , that she was now leaving the kingdom he had asked her to share . Not that his kingdom was as simple as that promised by his billboards ; even he would admit that such simplicity had never existed . Even in " pure , free " early America there had been tragedies in the farmhousesand blights on the corn . ( More , in fact . One must give science , progress , their due . ) As he had said , he could n't exempt her from the struggle . The world he had asked her to share had its portion of uncertainties and sorrows ; she had seen them for herself . But there would also be comfort and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt those things , too . What between-worlds kind of freak was she , then , who could say no to such an offer ? What kingdom did she keep expecting to discover just over the next hill ? She was beginning to wonder whether whatever drove her had her best interests at heart , or whether , indeed , it had any heart at all.  |p251Once  , during a teenage argument , Cate had scornfully accused Lydia of " only caring what other people think . " For a moment , Lydia had been stung . Was that the way she looked to others : one of those insecure girls who " only cared what people think " ? But Lydia clung for dear life to her self-esteem . She had learned that the best defense against her sharptonguedsister was a counteroffense , the more arrogant the better . Lydia had thought for only long enough to get her phrases straight and then retorted , " Well , of course I care what people think . Everybody does . And the people who say they do n't are only saying it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're the worst of all . At least I 'm honest with myself . " Her retort had gone over with surprising success ; she had seen Cate go abstract with that self-examining look she sometimesgot . Cate was thinking , Am I one of those people who say they do n't because they want other people to think they do n't ? Am I less honest than Lydia ? Lydia could read Cate 's thoughts . You learned a few tricks by living under the same roof with your tormentor . And having admitted that her self-esteem was bound up with the image others had of her , Lydia became fondly protective of this " trait , " and set about enhancing it with her individuality . For , all her life , Lydia had had the tendency to think well of herselfand possessed the related faculty of turning criticism to herp252own advantage . If " caring what others thought " was her " trait , " then it could n't be all that bad . Especially if she was honest in claiming it . And so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lydia would always assert , after the argument with Cate , in the same assured tone someone else might say , " Oh yes , I 'm an artist . " " I guess you could say I live by the forms , " Lydia would say . " Frankly , it saves me so much more time for other things . " " There are things life expects of you , " Lydia told her boys as soon as they were old enough to be her captive audience , " and there are things you have a right to expect of life . You just have to learn which is which . And get yourself organized . " And , on the whole , Lydia 's system had served her well . She organized life into neat compartments and tended to each compartmentat the proper time and place . She grew accustomed to hearing herself praised for this . " Lydia 's so good about channelingher energies , " Mother often said . " It 's a miracle , " said her friends , " how you always manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " afternoon-nap years , " she was always scrupulously careful to tend to the other compartments before hitting the pillow ; why , the nap itself could be said to be a compartment . There was a time and a place for it , and while she was doing it she did it well . ) And , until the late spring of her thirty-sixth year , Lydia 's system had never broken down . It had never even been seriously threatened . In high school , Lydia had been a good student during the week and a good date on the weekend . That was the main reason she had chosen to remain at the convent school , rather than dissipateher energies as Cate had after transferring to the public high school , where you knew boys were watching you even as you tried to study . Her first semester at Chapel Hill had been a little tricky ; too many expectations warred with too many temptations . It had been exhausting and confusing trying to fit everything into its proper place and time . But Max had arrived just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what life wanted from her with what she could get from it . And during her marriage , her compartment system had served her well . Her compartments organized her . If she had labeled them in her neat handwriting , they would have readsomething like : MOTHER . COOK . HOSTESS . INTERESTED WIFE ( " What exactly is a bond , Max ? " ) . WELL-DRESSED LADY SHOPPER . AMIABLE BED PARTNER . If , frequently , when going from one compartmentto the next , she sighed , or muttered in her thoughts , " Now . That 's over , " well . . . that did n't mean she had n't done it properly , whatever she was glad was now over . And when she had felt she could no longer be Max 's wife with the proper enthusiasm , she had moved out . There : that compartment closed now . Make a few new labels : MOTHER . ( And she was scrupulous about having Leo come at least once a week for supper at her apartment so he would n't feel she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SECRET LOVER OF STANLEY . STILL A LADY . But , just when she had been congratulating herself for managing everything so beautifully , serving everyone 's needs including her own , her system had let her down . Or rather , circumstances ( beyond her contro  --  ell , that was debatable , she guessed ) had posed a serious threat to her system . First , the contentsof one compartment had leaked into another , causing her some surprise and embarrassment . And then , just when she was figuring out how to mend the walls and clean up the spillage , anothercompartment  --  the most sacred to Lydia  --  had come under scrutiny and attack from outsiders . With the threatened system went the foundering of her image  --  what others thought of her , or what she thought they thought . And her self-esteem was currently at a shaky point until she could get things organized again . At the moment , she was sitting on the sofa in her apartment , the noisy air conditioner ruffling the pages of the yellow legal pad poised on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her term paper for Renee even as she worried about the rest of her life . " There is a time and a place for everything , " she told herp254boys , and she had already reserved the evenings of this week to write the term paper ( " Eros : Friend or Foe ? " ) before everything had fallen on her head . Max had taken Dickie and Leo to see Close Encounters of the Third Kind , and she wanted to have a rough draft sketched out before Dickie got back . Would Max come in ? It was still a little embarrassing to see him after that unfortunate encounter . Lord , what did he think of her ? That fool Stanley . How could someone so feeling as a lover be such a fool ? Or did feelings lead to such foolishness ? Max probably would come in . They had both agreed it would be best to stress " the family " at every opportunity , for Leo 's sake . Leo was not in school at the moment . Ever since " the Cookie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it , Leo had refused to go to school . His pride had been severely hurt . His system had betrayed him . But if he did n't go back soon , he was going to lose credit for a whole semester 's work  --  and all because of that spoiled little operator , Cookie . Max and Lydia had each had a session with the school psychologist , a Dr. Karen Small , but nothing had been resolved . Max had found Dr. Small humorless and slightly pitiful ( she had a great many moles on her face and arms ) but had jollied her along the way he did bank customers whose powers of investment exceeded their personal or intellectual charms . And Max was always especially amiable and polite to people he considered his inferiors . But Lydia had taken an instant dislike to Dr. Small , with her button-bright eyes so eager to peer into intimacies , and her deplorable jargon . She had turned Lydia right off by explaining she wanted to " triangularizeLeo 's situation . " By this she meant that she wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why not say so ? And Lydia could not resist replying , " But why not ' quadrangularize ' the situation ? We have four in our family . I have a younger son , Dickie . " " I know all about Dickie , " the button-eyed Dr. Small had told Lydia complacently , without a trace of humor . " Leo and I have already discussed Dickie . You took Dickie with you , to live across town , is n't that right ? And left Leo with his father when you and Mr. Mansfield separated ? "  |p255Lydia  had detected a definite slant in the way this woman perceived their " situation . " She saw herself through Button Eyes ' eyes : the fickle mother departing in a whish of graceful garments , her suitcase in one hand , the plump hand of the favored child in the other ; away they went in the callous mother 's car , leaving behind that nice , polite father ( who had been so amiable to Dr. Small ) and the dark , brooding older son , who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Was Dickie her favored child ? Did people think she favored Dickie over Leo ? But that was just not true . It was n't true . And Lydia felt herself go cold with the slap of this unearned accusation , although just a few minutes ago she had been swelteringdespite the ineffectual air conditioner that came with this apartment . She got up and turned it off ; it was so noisy , besides . At least Max and Leo had central air conditioning at the house . They had the color TV and ell the good furniture and the familiaramenities . They could spread themselves out . Really , though the Button Eyes of the world might not think so , Lydia had bent over backward to be fair about this thing . She had left Max the house because he needed a house like that more than she did . ( Lydia had wanted to live in an apartment all her life ; she had the idea it would be glamorous . Whereas Max had grown up in a sort of combination apartment/boardinghouse , where his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Livingin his own house was extremely important to Max . ) Well , she could not expect every nonentity in the world to appreciate the careful arrangements she had made for everybody when she had decided she could no longer live with Max , but , really , it was downright hurtful for them to think she had abandonedLeo for Dickie . That was just not so . Leo had wanted to stay on at the house . It was within walking distance of his school . He and his two best friends had formed a little club ; they called themselves , for some reason , " The Ghouls , " and they liked to meet at Leo 's house and shoot basketball goals or play pool , and their mothers would pick them up there . She had known Leo would be all right . He had his routines ; he kept his room neat without any coaxing ; he was so self-contained . Even as a baby ,  |p256he  had been able to entertain himself . Whereas Dickie ... well , bless his heart , Dickie was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , he would abandon his schoolwork and just climb on top of the piles of dirty clothes and other mess and play his clarinet , or listen to music with his eyes closed and eat too many Clark bars . Dickie needed more attention . But when Lydia had explained this , grudgingly , to Dr. Karen Small  --  grudgingly because who the hell was this young woman , younger than herself , who had no children of her own , who was n't even married and was n't likely to be  --  when Lydia had explained how Leo had always been the " good child , " that people , even when he was a little boy , had called him a " little man , " Dr. Small had fastened her flat little bright eyes on Lydia , as if she were reading some subtext  --  in jargon , no doubt  --  and , when Lydia had finished explaining the differences between her sons , had asked blandly , without a touch of tact or grace , " Did it ever strike you , Mrs. Mansfield , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lydia had not been able to speak for a moment . Waves of dislike all but blotted out her consciousness . To have to be subjected to this ... this creep . Where was she from , anyway ? She had no accent from anywhere . Perhaps they ironed out your accentat ... wherever Miss Small had gone to do her graduate work in psychology ... and programmed in this jargon . ( Lydia had squinted at the prominently framed degree behind her adversary'sdesk ... Rutgers University . Where in the hell was Rutgers ? ) " That is the silliest thing I have ever heard , " Lydia had finallyblurted , when she had regained her voice . " The silliest thing I ever heard ! " she now said aloud , angrily , in the apartment that was already growing stuffy again . She decided to sweat rather than turn on the noise again . She must get on with her paper . " Eros : Friend or Foe ? " Or fool ? No , she must not think of Stanley now . Of the two problems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of him now . He was safe at the movies with his father and brother , and this was the time she had set aside to do her paper . There is a time and a place  --   |p257But  : to punish a child for being good ! Lydia suddenly recalled a motto that had particularly enchanted her in seventh grade . She had been president of her class and had convinced her fellow students they should vote it in as the class motto . But SisterDelaney had protested ; the nun had almost wept . " You ca n't have that as your motto , girls . It is n't suitable . " " But it 's true , " Lydia had said . " It 's the truth , Sister . " " I know dear , but . . . it 's not a nice truth . It 's not hopeful . It 's cynical . " Finally the nun had won them over . They voted to have " Hitch your wagon to a star " as the class motto , instead of " The wheel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And yet that motto had gone straight to Lydia 's seventhgradeheart . It was true . The people who made the fuss and got into the most trouble did end up getting more attention . How often had she heard Mother and Daddy say , " Lydia 's all right , we do n't have to worry about Lydia , but  --  what are we going to do about Cate ? " One half-minute discussion of Lydia , followed by hours of discussion of Cate , who , though supposedly causingthem grief , also caused their voices to rise with a curious , taut fascination . What , oh what , was Cate going to do next ? Whereas you knew what Lydia was going to do ; you could depend on it . Enough of that , thought thirty-six-year-old Lydia . This is not the time to go into all that or I 'll never get to Eros . " We were brought up believing it is possible to find everything in one man , " Lydia wrote in her neat , flowing hand across the yellow page . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chaste and pleasing in manner and dress , that Mr. Right would come and marry us and satisfy all our desires . He would take over our father 's functions in caringfor us , he would be an intellectual equal ( or superior ) , and he would be the perfect lover . " She read over what she had written . It flowed nicely , but was it a little too glib ? Did it fall too much into the currently popularruts of blame ? ( " Look what a mess we 're in because they told us all those lies . " ) But how else should she start it ? She looked atp258her watch and realized she had wasted almost an hour getting started . She began to panic , as she used to , long ago , whenever she had to write a book report for school . One night she had worked herself into hysterics because she could n't get the first sentence of her book report . Daddy had taken her downstairs to his study and sat her down on his leather sofa with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal pads . " Now all you have to do is write me down one true thing about that book , " Daddy said . " I have n't read it , so anything you can tell me about it will be of interest . Do n't think of what your teacher expects you to write , or what you think you should write . Just write down one true thing about that book . " Ever since that night , Lydia had always used legal pads and soft lead pencils , sharpened to stabbing points , when she had to write something . Was what she had written true ? Well , yes and no . She was not exactly " brought up believing " those things , but , all the same , she had expected them . And , during her first few years of marriage , if anyone had asked her , " Did you manage to marry that All-in-One Package of Manhood ? " she would have answered , " Of course . " She read her paragraph over once again , hoping to spring from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ... and he would be the perfect lover . " For her birthday last November , Max had flown them to New Orleans in his Piper Archer . This was a trip they had wanted to take for years . New Orleans , to Lydia , had always suggested an interestingly decadent amalgamation of races , foods , and pleasures . It was where Rhett Butler had taken Scarletton their honeymoon . It was where you would go with a man who could protect you , and the two of you would order course after course of rich French food , drink some absinthe in a dark , seductively sleazy little bar , and then wander along , safely anonymousin a crowd of revelers , until some Negro playing a saxophonecalled you out of your tight , civilized self and you andp259your partner carried the rhythms of the jungle successfully back to your hotel room . For three consecutive days , Lydia and Max had eaten one rich meal after another , dragging their stupefied digestions back to their hotel in order to lie down and rest them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal , they wandered dutifully up and down Bourbon Street , where a music that sounded very little like Count Basie and a smell that they both recognized as marijuana assailed their middle-aged senses . Absinthe had been outlawed long ago ; they each had a Pernod in the Absinthe Bar , but it was not the same . In fact , it made Lydia rather sick , on top of the oversauced French meal . When , by ten-thirty at night , they turned to each other to put the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval on their married vacation , not the faintest throb of the jungle drum beat in their veins . But each had been painstakingly solicitous of the other 's self-esteem . Their tired , bloated bodies struggled together to preserve the illusion of a belated honeymoon . Besides , Clark Gable was dead and , several years ago , when Vivien Leigh got off the plane in Atlanta to attend the revival of Gone with the Wind , some reporter had come up and asked her , " What part did you play ? " On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rue Royale and bought two boxes of expensive Christmas cards , " Christmas in the Old French Quarter " : fine line drawings of how things used to look in the Vieux Cane , done by a local artist . On the trip home , she sat beside Max at the controls and addressedthe cards . She was glad she had remembered to bring along her address book . She hardly glanced at the clouds and patterns of light they were flying through . They assured each other several times what a good time they had had , though New Orleans had changed , obviously , from what it used to be . But did n't everything ? Max and Lydia Mansfield , she signed the cards . She waited till the end of November to mail the cards , becausehaving your cards arrive in November would be as bad as wearing your white shoes after the first of September.  |p260She  had moved out the first week in December , the day after Leo 's birthday . But you could n't put that in a term paper . Even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background for Eros . Lydia selected another sharpened pencil from her pile . " Eros , " she wrote , indenting for a new paragraph , " is what we mean by physical passion , or romantic love . " Then she remembered what Renee had said in their first conference and added : " But Eros can also be thought of as a striving for what one lacks , even though he is more often equated in our times with unmanageablesexual desire . " This would please Renee . Teachers liked to have their own words quoted back to them . Lydia 's upper lip had begun to perspire . She consulted the notes she had made at the library . In the absence of inspiration , she chose simply to elaborate on a note card . " The Greeks personifiedthese longings ( or strivings ) into a god . Sometimes they gave him wings . ( Meaning Eros ca n't last ? ) In Boeotia , an ancient Greek state where the people were still uncouth , Eros was worshipedas a large phallus . In antique art and on very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arrow or sadistically burning the wings off a butterfly with a torch . Eros is almost alwaysdisplayed as a young boy . " Here intruded an image of her own boy , Leo , on top of Cookie Cunningham . It was a speculative image , but it filled Lydia with jealous pain . Leo 's hips . . . that perfectly sculpted littlebutt she had wiped and powdered . . . and once , in London , in an ecstasy of mother love , had planted kisses all over before stopping herself : she did n't want to turn him into a queer or something . It made her sick , the thought of Leo and Cookie Cunningham . Not that she did n't want her son to be normal , but somehow Lydia prayed that his initiation into sex had not been with that manipulative girl . Cookie was one more " wheel that squeaked the loudest and got the grease . " Lydia bristled with anger . But this was not the time for anger . It was the time for Eros . " From no source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ap261new page , " have we been led to expect permanence from Eros , or peace , or self-respect . " Was that going too far ? Well , leave it in for now . Lydia had a fetish : every time she changed something , even one word , she had to go back and do the page over . " Eros is no respecter of family ties or social class . He does n't care a hoot for propriety . He may come dressed in a variety of garbs , not always in the best of taste , or he may speak in an accent foreign or unusual to the ear . Yet once we are pierced by his arrow , we becomeconsumed with a desire that often seems isolated from the rest of our lives . " Just writing the words " consumed with desire " had a physicaleffect on Lydia . Despite all the trouble Stanely had caused , she was still under his physical spell . But what was she to do with him ? After Lydia had been to Stanley 's place a few times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would like to do with her . He wanted to take her to dinner at that new PlantationInn where you could dance afterward ; he wanted to drive her west for a weekend in the mountains ( " Your mother lives in the mountains , does n't she ? " ) ; he was thinking about taking horseback-riding lessons at a stable in town : perhaps they could ride together , pack picnic lunches behind their saddles and eat in sun-dappled woods , their two horses tethered to a tree . As he came up with each idea for expanding into the world as a couple , Lydia had run the corresponding picture through her head . She saw at least a dozen couples she had known in her life with Max that they would be sure to run into if they went to any fashionable new restaurant in town . She saw herself and Stanley , each self-conscious for a different reason , walking toward the front door of her mother 's house in Lake Hills , where Nell , wearing that unsettling smile she could get on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other part told her she must behave , would be waiting to serve them tea , or drinks . ( " Well , " Nell would say , when they were all arranged in the livingroom . " What a nice surprise . This is wonderful weather for a trip to the mountains . I 'm so glad you let me know you were upp262here . I hope you 'll stay to supper . Stanley , Lydia tells me you 're from New York . What do you think of our ways down here ? No , really . Tell me , what do you really think of us , so far ? " ) Oh , Mother would carry it off ; she would probably enjoy the unexpectednessof it . But what would she be thinking of her daughter ? ( " Well , well , not what I would have expected Lydia to choose , but why not ? He is sweet . Those long eyelashes . And such an attractive physique . I suppose they are passionate lovers . . . . " ) Lydia burned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was true . They were passionate lovers . Mother would probably not even mind . It was Lydia who could not bear the thought of Nell 's thinking of her in this way . As for the horseback-riding picnic , it was out of the question : the two of them bouncing and sweating atop two dusty rented hacks who would stop and eat grass until you kicked them . They would sneeze , and swish their tails , and probably worse , during the picnic . Stanley was imagining something out of an English rural-wallpaper scene . Lydia felt she had to protect him from his own romanticism . He was really a touching man , surprisingly sensitive and full of all sorts of softnesses and feelings that did not seem to conflict with his masculinity . He was always surprising her with sweet gestures , or vulnerable statements that were almost frightening in their nakedness or originality . Once while they were lying together , he shocked her by saying he wished he could have a baby . On guard , Lydia had instinctively pulled the sheet up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons , she did n't think she wanted to have any more babies . " No , I did n't mean that , " he said dreamily . " I just meant I wished I could have one . Just one little baby that would come out of me and be all mine . " What a strange thing to say ! Lydia had felt repelled . No , she had felt that she ought to feel repelled . But after she had gone home and thought about it , it had grown on her . What a strangely attractive , almost erotic idea : her beautiful , slim , deferential Stanley as a male mother . The strange vision helped Lydia , temporarily , to a fresh reimagining of the world : gentle male motherswith their long brown arms and legs cuddling infants ; malep263mothers with healthy penises dangling freely beneath loincloths , but subjugating their male force to the care of a small creature . But , lacking practice in transferring vision into symbol , Lydia fell back into literal territory with a thud and Stanley 's vision seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby going to come out of him ? Would he still be able to have a penis ? What about breasts ? She remembered a story in the newspaperabout some man , left alone with a starving baby ; the man 's nipples had begun to leak milk . And in a way , this thing she and Stanley had between them was like that vision . As long as it remained softly focused , slightly blurred , with plenty of seclusion and shade , it could survive . But expose it to too much light of day , to the scrutiny of the wrong people , and it might disintegrate . It might " self-destruct " on the spot , like those secret instructions on the tape at the beginning of the old Mission : Impossible shows which all four of them  --  she , Max , Leo , and Dickie  --  had loved to watch . Lydia therefore told Stanley a lie , to protect this nice , private thing they had between them for as long as possible . She told Stanley that , though Max , her estranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was extremely jealous ; also , he had powerfulconnections in this city , and if she aroused this jealousy before the divorce came through , he might prevent her from having custody of the children . " We 're getting one of those divorces where nobody 's at fault , " she told Stanley . ( This part was the truth . ) " The two of you live separately for one year , and then it 's done . Without any ugly accusations . So it will be December before I 'll feel comfortable about going out . " This seemed to convince Stanley . " But you can at least come and see my office , " he said . So she let him take her to his office on his day off and show her all the equipment of which he was so proud ( bought with money borrowed from Broadbelt CommercialTrust ) : the examining tables and reclining chairs with great big trays for your feet , the X-ray machine , and some very nice etchings ( similar to that one in his bathroom back at the apartment ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A friend of mine in New York who 's an artist picked those up for me in Rome , " saidp264Stanley . " They 're by a fifteenth-century Italian artist . You know , the artists used to have to go out at night and rob graves in order to learn the bones of the body . " Lydia was almost in love with Stanley as he took her through the rooms where he worked , explainingeverything proudly in his soft voice with its emphases so different from the ones she was used to . She saw him in his hometown , New York , surrounded by his own network of friends , who would bring him things from Rome . It had taken courage for him to come down here and start all over again , friendless . And later that afternoon , when they were lying naked and damp from their loving exertions , she confided in Stanley how , recently , since starting back to school  --  and since meeting him  --  she felt she had crossed her own starting point and that she had a very interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it is yet , " she told him , " only I know it 's going to make me more alive than ever . I will be living a life in which I do somethingthat 's important . It will be something I can do well and care about doing . " And he nodded and squeezed her hand . " That 's exactly how I feel about what I do , " he said . And then he confidedto Lydia another of his startling visions . " You see , I feel I have to convince as many people as possible to get their feet in shape . " ( At this point , Lydia had to suppress a snicker ; Stanley saw it and looked slightly hurt . ) " No , listen , " he went on , " it 's important . People have got to take better care of their feet . You do n't know how it hurts me , every time a patient shows me a pair of ruined feet . It 's not just that it 's an ugly sight , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own death warrant . They can hardly walk . And I do n't mean just old people , either . Young people come in with their arches fallen and their toes all bunched together and their metatarsals already deformed . My heart sinks . I do what I can , but I want to tell them , ' Do n't you know we 're going to have to run ? ' I ca n't tell them that , they 'd think I was crazy , but I really do think that we 've all got to get in shape the next few years . I think we 're going to have to run for our lives . And the ones who hobble along or get out of breath just are n't going to make it . " " Run where ? " Lydia asked . " From what ? " " I ca n't tell you that . I 'm not a prophet . All I have is thisp265feeling . I 'm not the only one . Why are all these people suddenly getting in shape ? They sense something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not sure exactly what it is I sense . All I know is , I want to be ready . And I want to help other people be ready . " " But are you thinking of war , " Lydia pressed him , " or what ? " " I ca n't tell you . It 's like an animal instinct . I 've just got this feeling that we all may have to move pretty fast and be in the best shape we can . I try to run every morning except on the days I swim . Here , let me see your feet a minute . " " No , " protested Lydia , shoving them beneath the sheet . " I do n't want you to see my corn . " But he bent down and found her feet , anyway . " The corn 's okay . It 'll go away when you start wearing sandals this summer . But you should n't have worn the shoes that did this . " He rubbed his thumb professionally across the bunion on Lydia 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though . That 's a good girl . " His benevolent " doctoring " approach had aroused Lydia again . She bent down after him and they were soon locked together with their heads where their feet had been . Lydia found herself entertaining fervid visions of a catastrophe that would wipe out all her need for secrecy with Stanley . If the world suddenlyturned into a place where the best people were the leanest runners with the most durable lungs and the sweetest intentions , she could do no better than Stanley . She had held on to Stanley , blotting out the world where you always had to be dressed in the image you wanted others to see , and imagined their two slim naked brown bodies ( she would have lost some weight and got a suntan ) running , running , swift as animals , on healthy , higharchedfeet , toward a safe , quiet haven where they could begin to build a gentle civilization which could throb with a few rhythms of the jungle . A week or so later , Stanley had said , " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time Dickie spends the evening with a friend , you and I will go and see The China Syndrome at the movie house near my place . You 're going to have to trust old Stanley more . You 've gotten too uptight about this divorce . " Hep266had looked so certain and so mysteriously pleased with himself that Lydia had been convinced . What harm could there be , after all , in going to a nearby movie house and sitting in the dark with her lover ? Going out with a person after you had been married for a long time was , as she had told Renee , like making a statement , but this would be a harmless statement . It was not as if she were posting banns with Stanley in church . And so they had gone to an early-evening showing of The China Syndrome at the first opportunity Lydia could find to nudge Dickie into spending the evening with a friend . And she had to nudge , because , at the moment , Dickie was feeling very comfortable with just the two of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each going away after supper to do homework , and meeting at ten for a " reward " snack . Though Lydia had her reservations about Jane Fonda ( one more wheel that squeaked the loudest ... about things that had nothing to do with the profession of acting ) , she had enjoyed the movie . Having Stanley sit next to her in a public place , his arm draped casually around the back of her chair , was as erotic-inreverseas seeing him for the first time in his clothes after they had made each other 's acquaintance practically naked in the pool . And the movie , about a near-miss nuclear catastrophe , was made all the more riveting by the fact that real life  --  up in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania  --  had copied the scenario only a month ago . Perhaps that world of the leanest runners was coming closer . Lydia came blinking out of the dark theater with Stanley . She was still under the spell of the movie and poor Jack Lemmon'sdeath . Then she heard Stanley speaking in a friendly way to someone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The someone was Max . " Hello , how are you ? " Max was saying in his amiable voice . To Lydia , he said simply " Hel-lo , " but in a way that spoke volumes . With Max was a svelte , athletic-looking girl , wearing tight jeans and a T-shirt that showed off her thin , muscular arms . She looked vaguely familiar ; she was wearing running shoes . " Hello , " she said , flashing a mouthful of teeth that no longerp267wore heavy silver braces . " I guess we have n't seen each other since I was about thirteen . " It was Lizzie Broadbelt . Lydia had known she was back from the London School of Economics , and from an ill-fated romance with some Arab she had met in England . But in Lydia 's mind , Lizzie had remained the fat-faced child with a mouth full of silver ( and usually some bits of food ) who had whined around her grandfather 's chair during those awful , stiff dinners at the Broadbelts ' . Max had told Lydia that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trust and Investment departments , and Lydia had heard the information absentmindedly . She was n't prepared for this streamlined , smiling , poised female who looked so eager to be friends . " Hello , Lizzie , " said Lydia in a daze . Everybody but Lydia herself seemed to be smiling , relaxed , and at ease . She felt the victim of some kind of conspiracy . " How are you liking things at the Bank ? " " Well , it 's a job , " said Lizzie . She looked up at Max , who laughed , as he was supposed to . Lydia 's head was buzzing with confusion ; but she remembered her manners . " I 'd like you to meet Stanley Edelman , " she said to Max and Lizzie . " Stanley this is  --  " " Oh , we 've already met , " said Stanley , sounding very pleased with himself . " Dr. Edelman is a valued customer , " said Max , nodding cordially to Stanley . " We 've met , too , " Lizzie told Stanley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesson , when you came up . " The four of them stood smiling at one another until Lydia thought her face would break . Then , thank the Lord , the line in which Max and Lizzie were standing started to move . " You all enjoy the movie , " said Lydia , " if enjoy is the right word . " Then she looked pointedly at the handsome quartz which Max had given her for her last birthday . " Goodness , I 'd better get a move on if I 'm going to collect Dickie by nine-thirty from the Roberts ' house . " There . That ought to make that clear . To Max she said , " Is Leo okay ? "  |p268The  enduring priorities had been flung down , like respectablegauntlets , across this embarrassing scene . " I left him talking on the phone to a girl , " replied Max . " When I get back , he 'll probably still be talking . " Everyone laughed , as they were supposed to , and the two couples moved in opposite directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broadbelt called after Lydia . " We can compare our experiences in London ! " At Stanley , Lizzie flashed her orthodonticgems in an open salute to his dark , athletic attractiveness . They were , Lydia realized , near enough in physical type to be brother and sister . She walked , in a hot bubble of rage and confusion , beside Stanley to the parking lot where both their cars , wheels turned toward each other as if they 'd been having a date of their own , waited side by side . She could hardly think , she felt so dislocated and humiliated . She was trying to sort out what she had won or lost from the unexpected encounter , when Stanley crowed happily , " There now , did n't I tell you to trust your old Stanley ? The ice has been broken and nobody 's mad at anybody . " " Do you mean to tell me , " said Lydia , stopping in her tracks , " that you ... set this whole thing up ? " " You mean tonight ? Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I guess you could say I laid the groundwork . I went in to see him last week . I just wanted to meet him and have a look at him myself . It was the simplest thing in the world to arrange . I had some business there , anyway , and I just inquired casually whether Mr. Mansfield happened to be free , and he was , and they sent me right up . He was going over some charts or something with her  --  she 's the boss 's granddaughter , is n't she ?  --  but she went out while he and I talked . " " Talked . . . about what ? " " Oh , I had that all planned . I told him I was considering making some investments and wanted to know what he would recommend . " " And what did ... he recommend ? " asked Lydia , her chest so constricted she could hardly breathe . " Well , he asked me approximately how much I wanted top269invest . Then he was so modest  --  he said that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of the whole Bank instead of any individual investor that one of the younger officers might be more up on what I needed . But he said I could n't go wrong by starting with a couple of CDs . Those are  --  " " I know , " said Lydia , in a choked voice . " I know what CDs are . " Poor Stanley had been condescended to royally and he only thought Max was being " " modest . " She did n't know whom to feel sorrier for : Stanley or herself . Now that Max had seen them and put two and two together , he must think they were both fools : Stanley for going on such an ill-considered errand to the upstairs offices of the Bank ; herself for going with a man who would do such a thing . And Lizzie Broadbelt , what must she be thinking ? She must be sitting there in the movies next to Max having herself a private chortle over the comedown of the irreproachable Mrs. Mansfield , who used to shoot her such cold looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chair . Or were Max and Lizzie already discussing the unexpected meeting that had just taken place ( which Stanley called " luck " ! ) and all its ramifications ? For the first time it occurred to Lydia that Max and Lizzie were sleeping together . Well , that was to be expected ; Max was a normal man ; the two of them were thrown together every day . But ... surely Max was n't serious about her . The sleeping together was one thing , but if he could go so quickly from loving her to loving Lizzie Broadbelt , well , did n't that undermine the eighteen years ' worth of devotion Max had professed to feel for her ? " Would you mind telling me , " Lydia asked Stanley in the parking lot , " what you hoped to gain by going to . . . his office ? " She had almost said " my husband 's office . " " I told you , " said Stanley , who was just beginning to seethat Lydia was not as pleased as he had expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I wanted to meet him face-to-face . Iwanted to judge for myself . I have good instincts about people . Iwanted to see for myself how much we had to fear from him  --  " " To fear ? " In the confusion of all these revelations , Lydiahad , for the moment , forgotten about her lie : the little story shep270had made up about their having to be careful because of Max 's jealousy . " Yes . But I knew the minute we started talking that he was a reasonable man . I trust my instincts , and my instincts tell me we have nothing to fear from Max . " He spoke the name as if they 'd known each other , he and " Max , " since kindergarten . He pulled Lydia to him . " I thought you 'd be more pleased . And tonight ! Can you tell me how things could 've worked out any better ? Now it 's all out in the open . " " Yes , it 's all out in the open , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 're with me , " said Stanley , muzzling her neck , " and he knows it . And he 's consoling himself with Miss Broadbelt , and we know it . So nobody 's going to take your kids away from you . And now we do n't have to sneak around like we have something to be ashamed of . I can take you out proudly . " He parted his lips and played his warm breath upon the back of her neck . " And I 'll be proud . " Lydia stood with her head bowed , allowing Stanley to plant his necklace of kisses . She was overwhelmed by the blurring of lines that had suddenly complicated her new life , the life she had intended to have control over . She did n't know where anything fitted , with all these new developments , and she was not going to know as long as Stanley kept melting her down with kisses . He turned her into a blur . " It 's too much , " she said , her voice breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harder . He thought she was overwhelmed with relief . " Come back to my place . Just for a little while . " " I ca n't ! I have to pick up Dickie . I 'm already late , as it is . " She began to sob with frustration . All these demands on her , it was too much . Why could n't life be simpler ? All she asked was the space in which to be herself , and a simple , innocent passion with a man like Stanley , and the respect of other people . " There 's too much going on , " she accused him tearfully , " everyoneasks too much of me . I have to go away and compose my-self . " He was still in awe of her tears ; they were relatively new top271him . After they had arranged to meet as usual on Thursday , he reluctantly put her into her car . She drove off , still sobbing , and saw him in her rearview mirror . He was standing beside his BMW , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romantic , forlornfigure , under the blue-white glow of the parking-lot lights : her devoted knight who had climbed the wainscoted staircase of the Broadbelt Bank to confront the dragon for her sake , and had found only a modest , condescending fellow who advised a couple of Certificates of Deposit . He does n't want to get into his car and drive home to a place I 'm not in , thought Lydia ; he dreads getting into a bed whereShe started to bawl . But by the time she had reached the Roberts ' house she was in control again . Dickie came running out to the car , jumped in , and did n't notice a thing . Well , here comes the showdown , she had thought when Max had phoned , several days later , in the morning . " I have to talk to you , " he had said , in a businesslike voice . " Can we meet for an early lunch ? " It just so happened it was Thursday , Stanley 's day . It 's his own fault , he brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help feeling a perverse vindication as she hung up after making an appointment with Max , and dialed Stanley 's number . He had wanted things out in the open , had n't he ? Well , he would have to sacrifice part of their lovely Thursday ritual ( their " knowing swim , " they now called it , swimming their laps side by side , just as they had done before they had ever exchanged a word , only now " knowing " what was to follow afterward ) . Stanleywas disappointed she would not make it to the pool , but hoped she would come to him by early afternoon . " It 's best to have it all out now , " Stanley said , sounding pleased , if a little groggy , over the phone . She had waked him up ; he slept late on his day off . Now he would turn over and dream of her while she dressed for her " having-it-all-out " lunch with Max . She felt she had been thrust , against her will , onto the set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their old table in the little restaurantnear the bank . The headwaiter seemed ecstatic to see herp272again . To think ! Once this had been the favorite part of her life : getting dressed to kill as " Mrs. Max Mansfield " and going downtown to have lunch at this restaurant . Only , in the old days , she had gone to the Bank to pick Max up ; how she had reveled in marching past the tellers , eliciting from each a little greeting of homage before she turned right , past the glass cages of the credit and loan officers , and up the carpeted stairs into the somber , wainscoted regions  --  the regions where Stanley had so recently and intrepidly trod  --  where the brass titles on the doors grew more hallowed the farther down the hall you went . And Max 's was the last door but one from the end ; the end being Mr. Broadbelt , who had stopped coming in every day . Max stood up from the table , kissed Lydia with respect , and assisted the headwaiter in seating her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Lydia felt herself blush guiltily . " So are you . You 've lost weight , have n't you ? " " Thank you for noticing . I 'm making an effort . " But it annoyed her when , after she had ordered a daiquiri  --  just as in the old days  --  he asked for Perrier on the rocks with a twist of lime . " No martini ? " she asked . " Not today . I 've got to write my speech for an investment seminar and I need to keep my head clear . And , like I said , I 'm trying to get rid of this potbelly . " He slapped the front of his lightweight jacket , but rather complacently . He is sleeping with her , thought Lydia ; or getting ready to . It irritated her to remember all the times she had nagged him to slim down , to no avail . Yet he had professed to be devoted to her . " I will never love another woman the way I have loved you , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . But he would drink Perrier for Lizzie Broadbelt . " How 's Dickie ? " asked Max . " Is he losing any weight ? " " We 're all doing our best to improve ourselves , " replied Lydia , lowering her gaze to the menu , which she already knew by heart : it had not changed in ten years . " I 'm going to have my usual , the shrimp salad . " " I 'll join you . " Max ordered two shrimp salads and gave thep273waiter the menus . In all their years together , Max had never ordered a salad for lunch . Things must be more serious than she 'd thought . " And how is Leo ? " she asked , sipping her daiquiri : stalling . " That 's what I want to talk about . It 's why I needed to see you . " About Leo ? " She was surprised , and her voice revealed it . And she saw Max notice it , saw him register what it was she had thought he wanted to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have expected this . You sometimes saw more than was comfortable , when you had been married to a person and reading his face for eighteen years . Max was embarrassed for her , that she would expect him to sink to soap-opera tactics . " This morning , right before I phoned you , I had a phone call from Marshall Cunningham . " " The psychiatrist ? " " And the father of Cookie Cunningham , the girl Leo 's been dating . Hell , maybe I will have that drink . " Max motioned the waiter over . " One vodka martini , please . " " Oh Lord , do n't tell me she 's pregnant or something . " Lydia nevertheless felt her spirits rise when Max ordered the martini . It anchored her back in the secure old times , when she knew where she was with him . " Nothing so simple . " Max sighed . " Cookie tried to kill herselfnight before last . She swallowed almost a whole bottle of some powerful tranquilizer Marshall kept around for patient emergencies . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of Leo . " " Because of Leo ? " Max 's drink came . He took a liberal sip . " Marshall said they 'd had a fight , and Leo refused to see her anymore , or to take her to the Cotillion Club Dance . " " Oh really , " bridled Lydia , already on Leo 's side . " In my day , we did n't swallow pills ; we accepted another date for the dance . " She bit savagely into a stalk of celery from the little cruditesdish . It still had strings on it : this place was going down.  | " Luckily , " Max went on , lowering his voice , " Cookie 's mother stopped by her room to say goodnight . The Cunninghamshad been out for the evening . If they had n't come home when they did , Cookie might be dead now . " " Oh for Pete 's sake , I do n't believe this . " Lydia shook her head violently . Then stiffened when she saw the headwaiter covertlywatching . He probably thought they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're talking about death , when all Leo did was refuse to take her to a dance ? " " He 'd already invited her to the dance , Marshall said , but then after this fight they had , Leo dropped her , refused to let her explain her side . Cunningham insinuated we had brought him up too rigidly , which I did n't like one bit . But the reason he called was this : Cookie refuses to return to school until Leo goes to see her . " " I do n't see the point of that . Why should Marshall Cunninghamwant his daughter to see Leo if he 's such a monster ? " " I told you . She refuses to go back to school until  --  " " Oh pooh ! Ca n't Marshall Cunningham make her go back ? If Leo ' refused ' to go to school , I 'm sure we would n't put up with it . But of course , according to Marshall Cunningham , we 're ' rigid . ' Lydia was so furious with the Cunninghams that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you anything that girl waited until she heard her parents drive up before swallowing those pills . And what kind of doctor is it who 'll leave that kind of pill around for his children to swallow every time the least little thing does n't go their way . " Then , because she did not want to seem heartless , she amended , " I 'm sorry for the girl , of course . She must have been unhappy , even to fake it . " Max drained his martini . She saw him debating with himselfwhether to have another , then pull himself together and go backto his Perrier . " There 's a further complication . Leo wo n't go seeCookie . He absolutely refuses . I spoke to him just before he leftfor school . After Cunningham called . He was adamant . He saysit 's the principle of the thing , that he made his decision after theirfight , and , as far as he was concerned , that was the end of it . " " Good Lord , what did they fight about ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a little shocked at her son 's hardness . But principles were principles . Had n't she herself drummed that into him ? She was not going to desert his defense so easily . And had n't she herself been feeling hard toward Cookie ? Lydia could not get the image out of her head of the contriving little " heroine , " peeking out of the window as her parents drove up , then swallowing the pills . " There was n't time to go into it much . Leo said Cookie had ' made her decision and had to live with it , ' whatever that means . Then he rushed off to school . He does n't like to miss his first period . That 's that Social Studies course all the kids are wild about . Clever of them to put it first thing in the morning . He did n't even finish drying his hair . That was another thing : it was kind of hard to talk , with him running that dryer . " " Maybe I can get it out of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even when he was little , he 'd go into his own world and you could n't get a peep out of him . " Though Lydia had always admired this about Leo : his self-containment gave him a mysterious , finished quality . He had mastered a sort of cunning silence that made you think he knew more than perhaps he did . " I was hoping you 'd say that . " Max sounded relieved . Their salad plates came . Lydia counted the shrimp . Nine . There used to be twelve . The place was really going down . " Do you think you could pick him up at school today , maybe ? Catch him before he goes off somewhere with his friends ? If you could spend the afternoon with him , he might talk to you . I could pick him up around eight this evening . Just between us , I have a feeling it might be simplest for everyone if he 'd just go over there and see the girl . I know the Cunninghams are n't particularly our friends , but maybe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would n't want them to think that Leo 's behavior indicates any rejection of their daughter on our behalf . " Typical Max . Always bending over backward to keep peoplehe did n't even like from thinking he thought he was better than they were . " I 'll have to drive back across town to my place and leave ap276note for Dickie and put the keys in the flower box for him , " said Lydia . She ate a shrimp and thought , Well , Stanley , this is just not our day . And she would n't be able to phone Stanley until he came back from his lunch  --  by which time he would be expecting her and would be doubly disappointed . And if Leo was going to stay for supper , she would have to buy more hamburger meat . " You always know how to make him be sensible , " Max said . " You 've always been better at that than I have . You can make him see reason . Of course , I 'd be against forcing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't like that implication of Cun-ningham 's . " " In the first place , " said Lydia heatedly , " he has no right to set himself up as any arbiter of morality . Dammit , they were his pills . And I know for a fact that , even when I was living at our house , Cookie telephoned Leo half to death . She practically forced him into taking her out . I do n't see that we owe these Cunninghams anything . " For the first time today , Max looked at Lydia in " the old way . " " You 're a tigress , are n't you , " he said , " when it comes to defending your own . Just see how the land lies , will you ? We owe Leo that . " He continued to look at her admiringly , however , and she felt she had regained a little of her lost pride from the movie incidentthe other night . Whatever became of them both , it was important for Lydia to retain a hold on Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . He said he wanted to update Lydia 's portfolio . Get rid of some General Motors and buy more Texas Instrument . And the oil stocks would soar out of sight in the short term ; and , in the longer term , railroads , coal , and microchips . " I want you to be in the best shape possible , " he told her . " You sound like you 're planning to die " was her alarmed reply . " No , no . I just want to get things set up for you before thedivorce comes through . Not that I wo n't always be available foryou , but it 's good to do these things sooner rather than later . " It was the first time that Lydia could recall that he had said " before the divorce comes through . " Previously , it had always been " if we go through with the divorce . " And over coffee , Lydia could not resist broaching " the subject . " " How is Lizzie Broadbelt working out at the Bank ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lydia , imagining the ugly child with food in her braces , had not paid much attention . " She 's going to be okay . Broadbelt wants to groom her for foreign operations  --  we 're getting more and more into that ; she 'll be a great asset , she even speaks a little Arabic , which does n't hurt anyone today . But she 's still very young . She has a few wild ideas . Not that they 're not good ideas , but you ca n't change the system overnight . " " What kind of ideas , for instance ? " Lydia was suddenly extremelyinterested . " Oh well , like an international currency . " He laughed . " I told her , ' Lizzie , you 'll have us all up the creek here if you try to implement all those fancy ideals you got at the LSE . ' " Lydia made a note to ask her Economics professor why , exactly , an international currency would have us up the creek . " I suppose she learned her Arabic from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinked , but looked less concerned than Lydia would have expected . " No doubt . Old Broadbelt told me it was just typicalof Lizzie to fall in love with an Arab from the one country whose oil is running out . He would have been okay , though . His family owns one of the main banks in Bahrain . It was the family and cultural stuff that did n't work out . She went over there and met the family , Lizzie did . But she was a little too modern for them . Lizzie 's a woman of the future , all right . " Lydia recalled how , when she and Max were courting , he had told her how proud he was that she was still a virgin . " I 'm old-fashioned , I guess , " he had said . " I want to be the one to teach you . " And she also recalled how he really did n't mind that she did n't understand the intricacies of finance . He had often laughed dotingly over her worst mistakes , even going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her " not to worry her pretty head . "  | " There 's one other matter , " Max said . " Yes ? " Here it comes , she thought , rather anticipating it . " I 've been feeling remiss . I promised your mother I 'd fly to the Outer Banks sometime this spring and check on the cottage . And now the spring 's almost over . I do n't think I 'm going to be able to make it . Not this month , for sure . I really had meant to go . Not only because I said I would , but because that cottage will belong to the boys one day . Your daddy would want it kept in shape for them , and their children . What I had wanted to do was see about turning it into a rental property  --  for very select tenants , of course , the kind that take a house for a whole summer . There are special tax deductions if you turn it into a rental property . But this kind of thing is best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by phone . I was wondering if you might find a weekend or so to drive over . I could tell you what you 'd have to do . " Well , I have my school till the end of May , " said Lydia . " I suppose I could go then . But the boys do n't get out of their school till almost the middle of June . I suppose you 'd want me to take them , too . " In their **26;9277;TOOLONG code , Lydia was saying , I can cope with anything you ask of me , because I 'm organized ; but I just want you to know that you 're on the verge of imposing . " I can keep the boys with me , " Max put in , receiving the code . He had probably hoped to get out of everything , but , when put on the spot , he was usually fair . " You go on out there whenever you can . Have yourself a little vacation . " Oh no , you do n't , thought Lydia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; staking claims on who got to be the biggest martyr . And he probably expects I 'll go with Stanley , she thought ; he thinks I 'll take Stanley to Daddy 's cottage and we 'll have a passionate weekend while he sits home with the boys . When he probably meant to sit home with Lizzie while I took the boys . Lydia thought for a minute . " I know , " she said . " I have the perfect solution . Mother and I will go . As soon as my school is finished , Mother and I can drive to the Outer Banks and take care of everything . We 'll need to clean our stuff out if we 're going to rent the cottage . And it will be good for Mother.  |p279It  will be a sort of sentimental journey . We 'll have a chance to say good-bye one last time to Daddy in the place he really loved . " Lydia 's eyes filled . She snapped open her purse , the intricatelywoven gray leather one that Max had given her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initials on it . " Oh , honey , " said Max , looking miserable . He put his hand over hers after she had finished blowing her nose and put the handkerchief back . She saw the headwaiter watching . He probablythinks we 've decided not to get the divorce , thought Lydia . Lydia straightened her shoulders . She decided to leave while she was ahead . " Well , " she said , looking at the quartz watch , " I guess I 'd better get a move on if I 'm going to get everything done . I 'll pick Leo up at school . Shall I see you at about eight ? Try to make it by then , as I have lots of homework to do for my classes tomorrow . " " You 're a wonderful woman , " he said , rising when she did . He paid the bill and they separated outside the restaurant . Not one word had been said about Stanley . And , parked in front of Leo 's school , waiting for the dismissalbell , Lydia had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like us " do things ; we relegate them to the outer fringes by simply not mentioning them . As long as they are not mentioned , they do not exist in our world . And how can they be a threat if they do n't exist ? So , according to our luncheon topics , " our " world includes Leo and Dickie , it includes Mother , it includes the Broadbelts , it even includes Lizzie 's Arab ; and it includes the Cunninghams , who do n't like us one bit more than we like them , but whose melodramatic daughter has changed the shape of my day . I 'm sorry , but I do n't for one minute believe that girl intended to kill herself . Or am I being hard ? Am I lacking in feeling ? But I am fiercely protective of what is mine . . . my nearest and dearest .. . a tigress , Max called me . That counts as feeling , does n't it ? What was it Renee said , when we were talking about Eros ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Am I attracted to Stanleyp280because he has the feelings that I lack ? But if what I have for him is n't feeling , then what are feelings , I 'd like to know . And it is n't just the sex . When I phoned him to say I could n't come this afternoon , and he asked , " What did Max say , at the lunch ? " I said , " It was mostly about our son Leo . Some girl took an overdose of pills because Leo did n't want to see her anymore . " That was n't a lie , we did talk mostly about Leo ; but I could n't stand to let him know he was n't even mentioned  --  not even " How did you and Stanley like the movie the other night ? " I felt so protective of him . My pride hurt for his pride ; if that is n't feeling , I do n't know what is . And then he said , " Your son obviously has the fatal charm of his mother . " Meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't see him anymore ? No , I do n't think he would do that ; I would n't want him to do that . But I could tell he was really disappointed that I could n't come today . Strange : traditionally it 's been the woman who waits at home for the man to " call in " and say whether he can get away from all the demandsof his busy schedule for a stolen hour of secret love . Only our love is n't entirely secret anymore . The thing that gets me is that , if Max should marry Lizzie Broadbelt , who is twenty-three years younger than he is , people would think it was perfectly suitable . They would consider it a " good match " for both of them . Whereas , if I married Stanley , which I have no intention of doing  --  I 'm not sure I ever want to get on that merry-go-round again  --  people would consider it a comedown for me . " Oh , she married a younger man , " they would say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not very attractive . You can tell she 's very physically attached . . . . " And Stanley is only five years younger than I am . Jake Galitsky was four years younger than Cate . But Cate could n't care less about such things . Why do I ? I do n't . But it infuriates me for others to judge me . People like ... the Cunninghams. . whom I do n't even like . Why is it I have spent so many hours in my life worrying about and working for the good opinion of people I do n't even like ? Because I do n't want to give them the opportunity to misjudge me . If I conform outwardly to their approved image , then I can keep my distance from themp281and control what they think about me . But why should I care what they think of me ? Lydia had gone around and around this maze for a while and then relaxed her brain with a brighter image : the huge , unspecified ( so she would n't have to imagine the ugliness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other swift , durable people with sweet intentions would be allowed to escape , running on healthy feet to a gentler , less critical world . In her mind , she blew up places like The Plantation Club and all country clubs ; she had just reached the Broadbelt Bank and had her deadly weapon poised ( What about Max ? Should she give him a chance to escape ? And Lizzie ? She did n't really hate Lizzie ; only why was it that , even when you did n't want someone for yourself anymore , you did n't want anyone else to have him , either ? And the children ? What was she going to do about Leo and Dickie in her catastrophe ? Leo could run , but Dickie would have to lose some weight if he were to make it to the New World ... ) . Lydia had just reached this complex set of decisions in her fantasy when Leo , tall and beautiful , flanked by his usual sidekicks , The Ghouls , came out of the modern school building . He saw her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be waiting in front of his school  --  and indicated her presence to his friends ; the three boys strolled toward the car with the practiced nonchalanceof very young men . He really is lovely , thought Lydia , her chest filling with pride . But there is a sort of heartless self-containment about him . Lord , what would I have done if I had been in love with someone like Leo when I was fifteen ? Eaten my heart out , I suppose . I know I would have died before I ever picked up that phone and called him . And she felt sympathy for Cookie Cunningham . It pleased her that she felt the sympathy . That meant she was n't heartless . But what was Leo feeling ? Surely , behind that reserved exterior , he must be feeling something . Well , that 's why she was here , to find out . Leo leaned one elbow against her open window . " How come you 're here ? " he asked innocently . His two friends greeted herp282respectfully ; they hovered , just within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the atmosphere that they all knew why she was here ; they had already discussed the whole thing , just as girls would have . Lydia supposed that if some boy had tried to kill himself over her when she was fifteen , that , yes , she would have gone right to school and found her sidekicks and related everything in a hushed , self-important voice : it was drama , after all . " I was wondering if you 'd care to spend the rest of the afternoon with me , " she said to Leo so his friends could hear , too . " That is , unless you 've got something better to do . " She was flirting with her own son , a little . But she knew she could get away with it ; she was one of the " young " mothers , whom the boys still thought of as an attractive woman , as well as " a mother . " And she did n't want to humiliate Leo in front of his friends ; he would not forgive her so soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she herself had been able to , at his age . ( Once she had not spoken to Cate for a whole week , that time Cate tattled to Daddy about her " denying " Uncle Osgood at the Mountain Crafts Fair . She had marked off each day on her little calendar every night , and prayed to God to " harden her heart " like Pharaoh 's till the end of the week ; for Lydia had been sure God was on her side . ) " We were thinking about going over to the house and shooting some goals , " said Leo , watching her ; but he was intenselyconscious of his friends in the background . " That 's always fun , " said Lydia . She included his friends in an appreciative glance , as if to say , With two such interesting friends , how could it help but be fun ? " But today I was hoping we could go off alone , just the two of us . I need to talk to you . " Leo shrugged . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess I 'd better come , then , " said Leo . He ambled around to the passenger side . " See you guys later . " The friends stuck up a hand each in a casual wave . " See you later , Leo . So long , Mrs. Mansfield . " There , now ; everyone felt respected.  |p283Lydia  drove them to Tanglewood , a vast park of over a thousand acres bequeathed to the city " for the recreation of all " by the late heirs of Richard Joshua Reynolds , who , in 1875 , at the age of twenty-five , had opened a small factory to produce chewingtobacco . Lydia had begun bringing her children here when Dickie was still in his stroller . It was almost a ten-mile drive , but she loved its spaciousness . On lucky days , there would be whole stretches of park filled only with the sounds and presences of birds and small animals  --  and herself and Leo and Dickie . She had preferred being alone with her own children in a huge park to sitting on a bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were isolated into a screaming pack . At Tanglewood , Lydia had invented a game for herself and the boys . It was called " Philanthropy "  --  although , for a long time , Dickie called it " Philandropy . " The game had come into existence when one of the boys had asked why two dead people , William and Kate Reynolds , had left this enormous park  --  which to two small boys seemed as big as the world  --  just to play in . " Well , " said Lydia , thinking it out as she went , as she was often called on to do , " rich people  --  that is , certain rich people  --  reach a point where they have everything they want . And then they decide to use the money they have left over to make other people happy . That 's called philanthropy . Of course , another reason they want to do it is because they may be getting old and they want to be remembered after they die . " And , from then on , on every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell what they would " leave for others " after they had got all they wanted for themselves . Lydia smiled now as she walked through the park with Leo , who would soon be taller than she . " Do you remember when Dickie wanted to bequeath a huge open-air zoo , where all the animalswould be allowed to roam free ? Then you said , ' But Dickie , if they are allowed to roam free , then people could n't , and , what 's more , the animals would eat each other up . ' " Leo laughed in that soundless way he had . " Yeah . And Dickie cried . "  | " Lord , yes , he did , did n't he ? " And , all these years later , Lydia 's stomach turned over with pity for that poor little boy who 'd had his dream dashed by reality . But this was Leo 's day . " And you were once going to bequeatha baseball field . And once you and Dickie were going to bequeath allowances for every child so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't quite cover . " They both laughed . This time Leo laughed aloud . " You said you were going to leave a big quiet house with bedrooms , where mothers could go and have naps while the children were right next door in another house , watching movies and things . " " Oh Lord , was I that transparent ? How awful ! What did you all think when I said that ? " " You were tired an awful lot , " said Leo . Then he added politely , " Not that you were always tired . " " Having young children is such a strange time , " said Lydia . " I went around in a daze sometimes . But , in a way , you have to be in a daze , or the sheer terror of your responsibility could overwhelm you . Can you understand that , at all ? " " I think I can , " said Leo , whose voice expressed willingness to try , even though he did not quite understand . " Of course , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew what she was doing on this walk . Getting Leo to open up was a little like eating spareribs or lobster claws : you had to expend a lot of effort for the little you got . " Now you two are reaching the age where our interests are mutual . You , particularly . Soon you will be making the same decisions I have to make . What kind of work to do . What kind of life to lead . Whom you want to have as ... friends . I feel we really have a lot we could talk about now . I 'm no longer in a daze . Since I started back to school , I feel the world 's opening up for me . I do n't have the terror about you two anymore . As much . Of course , I still worry . Only , whereas I used to worry about you all falling off swings or sticking knives into the electric sockets , I now worry about . . . well , the same things I worry about for myself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things I said . Finding the right work to do . And how to live your life so you 'll like yourself and look forward more to getting up in the morning than going to bed at night . And choosing the people you want to ... be with in your life . Here . let 's sit down . " They sat down on a wooden bench in the arboretum , which , at this time of spring , was dizzying with lovely scents . He knows it 's coming , thought Lydia , and he 'll resentit if I sneak up on him : the direct approach is best . " This is fun , being here with you . It 's the first time we 've ever been here alone , just you and me . This may sound awful , and I certainly do n't want to underestimate her pain , but I have to be grateful to Cookie Cunningham for bringing you and me together like this . Only , from now on , let 's take matters into our own hands and find time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can do that ? " Leo lowered his profile in a semi-nod which could be a yes , a maybe , or an undecided . Lydia pulled a leaf from a shrub and began shredding it . " Do you think she really meant to kill herself , Leo ? " " Probably not . " " That 's funny , I did n't think so , either . I do n't know why , do you ? " " She called me up and told me she was going to do it , " said Leo , looking straight ahead as if watching some movie in the azalea bushes across the path . " But I thought it was just a way to get me to come over . She said if I was n't on her doorstep within fifteen minutes , she was going to take the pills . She already had the glass of water ready , she said . " " But you could n't possibly have got there in fifteen minutes ! It would be impossible without a car , and you ca n't drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , he was taking Lizzie to see The China Syndrome . Cookie told me I could call a taxi . " Lydia kept her face still so as not to show her surprise at some of this information . So Lizzie was already a household word . So much for Max 's enduring devotion for " the onlyp286woman he 'd ever love . " Though maybe he was just saving his pride or looking for companionship . Lydia could n't rule that out yet , till she had further evidence of how far things had gone . Leo and Cookie 's drama had been going on while the adult foursome were having their drama in front of the movie house . Had n't Max said he had left Leo talking on the phone to a girl when he left ... and that they would probably still be talking when he got back ? And they had all four laughed . Possibly at the same moment Cookie was swallowing her pills . " In the first place , a taxi would never have made it to our house in fifteen minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Had you and Cookie had a fight , or what ? " After another forty-five minutes of Lydia 's graceful prodding , Leo had provided a sparse scenario . He and Cookie had had a fight , several weeks ago . They were at a party , over at one of The Ghouls ' houses , in Leo 's neighborhood , when Cookie suddenlyannounced she had a headache and wanted to be driven back to her house by Rodney Bradshaw , the only person in their crowd who had turned sixteen and had his own car . Leo told Cookie to call her mother and have her mother come and get her ( her mother had brought her ) , or he offered to take Cookie home in a taxi . But she said that would be trouble to everybody and she would just go on with Rodney . Leo told her if she went with Rodney , then she could just keep on going wherever she liked with Rodney , but not to expect to go anywhere with him again . Cookie , a headstrong girl , used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and departed  --  a little too happily for someone with a splitting headache  --  with Rodney in Rodney 's car . Only , Leo was n't bluffing . That was the end , as far as he was concerned . That was the way he had been raised : you honored your ultimatums ; otherwise , people would n't believe you the next time . But Cookie refused to believe Leo was through . All she had done , she said , was ride home with someone because she had a headache . ( For whatever reason , Cookie and Rodney had extinguished their brief , incipient flame during the ride home ; perhaps Cookie had felt too divided over Leo and her new attractionand Rodney had decided to quit while he was ahead ; orp287maybe Cookie did have a headache , but , Leo said , a headache was n't all there was to it , and he 'd had enough . Cookie was the one who 'd chased him , to start with . ) But Cookie had phoned and pestered and wailed . She had sent her girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be " rigid " ; " You do n't want to be a male chauvinist , do you ? " they told him . " That 's not the point , " Leo had said , and held fast . " Cookie was testing her freedom , " the girl friends explained ; " She has her freedom now " was Leo 's reply . " But you have to take me to the Cotillion Club Dance ! " wailed Cookie . " That 's been set up since February . " Leo had said , " Get Rodney Bradshaw to take you . " " But he 's already got somebody . And  --  and  --  besides , I 'd rather go with you . " " Thanks , but no thanks , " said Leo . " But people do n't break dates for the Cotillion Club ! It just is n't done . " " Well , this person is doing it , " replied the intransigent Leo . The only thing left in Cookie 's arsenal was to threaten suicide  --  " ifyou 're not on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her it was her life . Just as it was her freedom . After Lydia had finished extracting this story from Leo , she picked another leaf from the shrub . This one she did not mutilate , but simply brushed softly , back and forth , across her cheek . " Listen , " she said , " this is a hypothetical question , but what would you have done if Cookie had killed herself ? " " She would n't have ! It was all an act ! Everything 's an act with her . She 's all over a guy , but even that 's an act . It 's really herself she 's in love with ! " More emotion than he had shown all afternoon . Lydia began to understand . " I said it was hypothetical . I mean , what would you have felt when you found out ? " " I would have felt I was to blame , I guess . " " That would have been awful to live with for the rest of your life , " said Lydia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ruined Leo 's life . " Well , I certainly am glad she did n't kill herself . " " So am I , " said Leo . " But now I want to be done with it . " Lydia detected the anguish in her son 's voice . She couldp288pretty well fill in the rest of the picture . There were a few things more she would have liked to know , such as : Had Cookie seducedhim ? How had she gone about it ? ( For Lydia was almost positive it would have been her initiative . ) Another mother , emboldenedby her progress , might have risked prying further . But Lydia 's fastidiousness prevented her . She did n't discuss her sex life with others , and Leo was enough like herself to share the same reluctance about putting certain things into words : something had to be left private in this overly vocal world . " Daddy says Dr. Cunningham wants you  --  or rather , Cookie wants you  --  to come and see her at home , " said Lydia . " Daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cookie wo n't go back to school , she says , until you come and see her . " " What did Dad say I should do ? " " He did n't say you should do anything . He said it might be easier if you went on over there . " " What do you think ? " And Leo turned and looked at her . " What do I think ? Lord , what do I think ? " Lydia sat pensively , the leaf poised against her chin . Leo was right , in principle ; but she had this feeling he was going to be ostracized if he did n't compromise , at least outwardly . His peers would make his life hell for being too principled , if they were already calling him " rigid . " They would want him , for their own melodramatic satisfaction , to play out the rest of the scene . To go over to Cookie 's house and stand solemnly in her ruffled bedroom and let her cry a little and enjoy to the maximum the trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own child , so much like herself , to go against his own principles , just to placate the prurient , melodramatic crowd ? " Leo honey , I think it would be easier to go on over there . Could you do it in the spirit of noblesse oblige  --  remember how Granddaddy used to talk about noblesse oblige ? She 's obviously a mixed-up girl and has more to lose than you do . If you could get it over with in that spirit , I do n't think you would be sacrificingyour principles . " If I conform outwardly to their approved image , then I cheat them outp289of their chance to misjudge me . This way I can get on with being myself : her own silent credo as a schoolgirl . " But it would n't be over ! " protested Leo . " She 'd think I was making up . She 'd expect me to start over with her again . She would have won . I ca n't do it , I just ca n't . " Maybe he is stronger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I knew what barricades to build . But if he is stronger , why should I hold him back from testing his strength ? ' ' Listen , Leo , " she said , dropping the leaf , which , still intact , fluttered away in a little eddy of warm air , then boomeranged at the last second and landed on her foot . She reached down and picked it off . " I 'll stick by you , whatever you decide to do . And I 'm sure Daddy will , too . We 've both got faith in your good sense . " " I appreciate that , " said Leo gruffly . They got up , at Lydia 's instigation , from the bench and headed back toward the parking lot . Lydia feigned greater interestthan she felt in the bark of certain trees , the blossoms on other bushes . She was careful to keep from looking at Leo because she knew he was struggling not to cry . And that same evening , after Max had come by to pick up the resolute Leo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had coped with it all , on this trying day . She had stood by her son and reinforced Max 's opinion of her as a " wonderful woman . " She was so charged up with her own efficiency , she could n't bear to sit still studying . She had called her mother instead , to inaugurate the June trip to the cottage . Nell had seemed amenable , if distracted . There was , it seemed , more trouble across town with Theodora and Wickie Lee . Wickie Lee had met some young woman in the hospital , named Rita , who was on welfare . Theodora had told Wickie Lee that Rita could not come to the house on Edgerton Road anymore because she was " common " and a bad influence . Now Wickie Lee was threatening to leave Theodora and move in with Rita and Rita 's children , who lived off the state . Oh , everybody 's soap opera ! thought Lydia . But that wasp290one more thing done : Mother had agreed it would be a good idea to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Outer Banks in early June , talking about old times and reinforcingtheir bond . Just as Leo and I reinforced our bond today , Mother and I will reinforce ours in early June , Lydia had thought . And then an added realization had come : Both Leo and I are the " good " children in the family . And when , shortly after that , the phone had rung ( Lydia snatching it up on the first ring because Dickie was asleep ) and Stanley 's voice , low-pitched and with those different emphases , announced that he was in a phone booth less than fifty yards from her front door because he could n't go the rest of the day without having seen her at all , when this was supposed to have been their day , she had thought , Well , hell , I deserve some reward for all I 've done today . And out she had slipped , locking the door behind her , and had walked swiftly through the soft night toward a well-earned embrace from her importunate lover . As she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkest shadows , so what they did would be their own business , and yet ( thoughtfully ) had parked within full view of her apartment , in case it caught fire or anything , Lydia had felt like an accomplishedsecret agent , equally at home in all the territories which she must oversee even as she lived in them : territories which , because of certain conflicting interests , must be kept separate from one another . But her pride turned out to have been short-lived . Leo , abiding by principle , had stood firm in his refusal to go to see Cookie . And Cookie , more and more the tragic heroine each day he did not come , refused to go back to school . For one week , the stalemate held : Cookie at home , Leo going about his business at school . But at the beginning of the second week , things shifted . Lines were drawn ; pressure was put on . The pressure came from Leo 's friends ( though Lydia and Max thought they detected some behind-the-scenes machinations from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fourth of the parents of Leo 's classmates ) ; the girls quit talking to Leo , or , when a group of them passed him inp291the halls , they would chant under their breaths , " MCP , MCP " ( for Male Chauvinist Pig ) . And Leo 's favorite teacher , Mrs. Epting , who taught the popular Social Studies , a sort of free-for-all forum in which the kids discussed marriage and the family , teenage sexuality , violence in today 's world , and the loneliness of our senior citizens , had kept Leo after class and begged him to " have a heart . " No man is an island , Mrs. Epting told Leo ; we are all interworking parts of the human community . Up until then , Leo had thought Mrs. Epting , a curvaceous , well-married matron with slightly protruding teeth , was his friend . But when Leo explainedhis principles to his friend , Mrs. Epting said principles were one thing , but she was disappointed in his lack of humanity . Next , The Ghouls abandoned Leo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a rash of dental and doctor appointmentsafter sch000l . The Ghouls ' girl friends were Cookie 's allies . Leo , left alone with his principles , wandered the halls like a pariah for two more days . On the third day , when Max came into Leo 's room to get him up , Leo , lying in his pajamas , with his arms around his half-blind old dog , Fritz , told Max he would not be going back to that school anymore . " But you 'll lose credit for the semester , " said Max , trying first for practicality , which usually worked on Leo . " I can go to summer school , " said Leo . " With no friends , there 'll be nothing else to do . And maybe next fall you could send me to a private school . I think I would be able to concentrate better at a private school , anyway . " Leo stayed in his room , playing a song on his " I Robot " album over and over gain . On his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes at UNC-Greensboro to come over and be with him , he was still playing it . She put a spinach quiche in the oven  --  ah , how nice to have a see-through oven , at eye-level , again  --  and came into his room and sat on his neatly made bed and listened to the song with him . It was by that same Alan ParsonsProject chap whose solitary space-age music she had played on cassette , the night Daddy had died and she had sped acrossp292the I-40 to be with Mother . Only this song was much more sentimentalthan the usual Alan Parsons . Lord , if she 'd heard this song on the night Daddy had died , she would have driven off the road in grief . This song abetted grief . It was exactly the wrong song for Leo to be listening to in his situation . Why , even the words , starting off against a background of choir music , seemed sinisterly tailor-made to Leo 's predicament . It 's getting harder to face every dayDo n't let it show , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say Just let it go , just let it goLydia was practically in tears by the third or fourth verse , as she and Leo sat raptly absorbing the song . But by the last verse , things had got better . The singer 's martyrdom and pariahhood had undergone a transformation ; now , against a fast , defiant rock beat , he belted out his singularity  --  he was enjoying it . Even if you feel you 've got nothing to hide Keep it inside of youDo n't give inDo n't tell them anythingDo n't let itDo n't let it showAt last the song faded triumphantly into pure instrumentation , and then it faded out altogether . Good-bye , human community ; then , good-bye , world . Which was just fine for a young Englishman who had recordedthese albums and who was probably a millionaire by now , but where did that leave Leo ? Who really was suffering and confused , with or without musical accompaniment . Who needed his education . After Leo had been out of school several more days andp293Max , then Lydia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had also come by the house to have a " one-to-one dialogue " with Leo , Cookie Cunningham saw fit to rise from her tragic bed and return to school . Everyone , even the teachers , thought she was " so brave . " Once again it had happened : the wheel that squeaked the loudest had gotten the grease . Lydia felt it was a defeat for them both : for Leo and his princples ; for herself as a mother  --  after all , who had taught him his principles ? But , more important  --  and this was what really made her angry ( no wonder she was having trouble concentrating on her " Eros " paper )  --  she felt it was a defeatfor the Individual trying to live by his lights . Once again , the sloppy , inconsiderate " feelers " had won out over the quiet , diligent " reasoners , " who had their feelings , too , but kept them inside . Cookie Cunningham had initiated this whole fake soap opera , beginning with her " headache , " because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ending when she returned to school a heroine . To be rewarded . While Leo was punished . And it was happening all over society ; the more mess you made of your life and the louder you were about making it , the more " funds " the government provided you with , so you could go out and make some more mess . And who had to pay for all these generous , " humanistic " funds to sustain the messeruppers ? The quieter , reasonable people who did what they were supposed to do and earned the money : the workers in Mrs. Epting 's " interworking human community . " And to add insult to injury , this point of view that Lydia subcribed to was considered unfashionable and inhumane . She could just hear , for instance , Cate 's diatribe in answer to her own protest . What the " liberals " had done was somehow to pervert the old noblesse oblige by making it into a drab duty , a fashionableduty . You could n't make noblesse oblige into a duty or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The true charity , not the sounding-brass kind . The whole point was to have the freedom to say : God , look at that poor deserving beggar , I 'll help him because he 's less fortunate than I , and because I 'll like myself better if I help him . But when the undeserving messer-uppers pushedp294in your door with their hands out ( or laughing behind their hands because they had learned how to work the system ) , where was the charity or dignity or equality or anything else ? Lydia seethed . God , I wish I had some power in this world , she thought . How can I get some power so I can make people listen to good sense ? Max brought Dickie home from Close Encounters . " I ca n't stay , " he said . " Leo 's waiting out in the car . He 's pretty low and wants to go to bed . I thought the movie would cheer him up , but it did n't . " " It was n't supposed to be a cheerful movie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gregory and now had the young orange cat draped over his shoulder . The cat hung limp , purring and pumping the air with his two front paws . " It was a thoughtful movie about what might happen . You really should have stayed , Dad . It was something when those little creatures got off the spaceship . " Max looked as if he would n't mind clobbering Dickie . " I just could n't concentrate on a movie , he told Lydia , smoothing the front of his Lacoste golf shirt with the flat of his hand . This was a new gesture , as if he were molding himself a waistline with his flat hand until the Perrier could do its work . " I had too much on my mind . So I went down to the office for a while . " " We all have so much to do , " assented Lydia , looking around at all her discarded pages . " I had planned to draft this whole paper , but I had so much on my mind . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having shot his arrow , had retreated to the kitchen , where he was feeding Gregory for the fifth or sixth time that day . She heard him shake more Friskies into Gregory 's bowl . " Poor old Greg , here 's a few crunchies for you , " Dickie crooned in his child 's voice , " you must be starved . " Max , suspended in the doorway , said , " Private school would n't be such a bad thing for Leo , if he wants it . I took a look at his history book . I was shocked . It looked like a fat issue of Look magazine . A tenth-grade history book . Do you rememberp295your tenth-grade history book ? I remember mine : there were words in it ; whole blocks of print without any pictures . " " If he wants to go next year and you 're willing to pay for it , I do n't have any objection , " said Lydia . " I know I did a lot better at a private school . Of course they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back and finish out the year here . Otherwise , it will seem as if they 've driven him away . And he 'll lose the semester . " " He said he 's willing to go to summer school . Though I agree with you , he ought to go back and face them down . But that 's easier said than done for a fifteen-year-old boy . A day is still a long time for him . We 're talking about a whole month . And he might not be able to concentrate . So far , he has n't been able to open a book at home . Where nobody 's glaring him down . " " Oh damn , " said Lydia . " I agree , " said Max . " It 's hot in here . You look hot . " " Well , I am hot . This air conditioner belongs in the Smith-sonian . " " That 's another thing , " said Max . " If Leo does go to summer school , I 'd like it if you 'd come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be there for him . I could move in here , or somewhere like it . " " You could n't last a week in a place like this . You like your luxuries and your space . " " Oh , come on now . I 'm not that much of a tenderfoot . Well , think about it . I believe it might be the best arrangement . " " Okay , I 'll think about it . Only I wish you 'd get yourself a house . " " Well , I may , at that . " Lydia stood up , brushing aside a dozen or more crumpled balls of yellow paper . " I 'll walk out to the car with you . If Leo 's too tired to come in and say goodnight to me , I guess I 'll go out and say goodnight to him . " She felt oddly let down . It would have been nice to have a drink and talk . That was one of the things she missed most about being married : talking , over drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain comfortin their problems , which helped you gloss over your own.  |p296After  Max and Leo were gone and Dickie and Gregory had bedded down , Lydia dialed Renee 's number in Greensboro . She had been tempted to check in with Stanley , but decided against it ; it might get his hopes up by convincing him that she was growing dependent . That would n't be fair . She still did n't know what , in the long run , to do about Stanley . Renee answered right away , in a soft , faraway voice . " Oh damn , I 've waked you , " said Lydia . " What are you talking about , girl ? It 's only nine-thirty . No , I was typing up a paper , to send off to Southern Studies . " " Oh , what on ? " Lydia 's heart was thumping . She was still a little nervous about calling Renee . The new had not yet worn off their friendship , and there was still a flirtation going oh  --  as it does even between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tried to be her best and most interesting self . Lydia 's first reaction , for instance , when Renee announced she was working on a paper , was : Oh , what a coincidence ! I was just working on my paper for you ! But that might have been seen by Renee as mixing business with friendship , if Lydia had blurted this out . " Well , it 's really no more than a footnote in my thesis . But this editor at the Southern Studies Institute found it interesting and asked me to expand it . Actually , it 's about a tiny aspect of black snobbery . " " Black snobbery ? " " That 's right . You see , blacks who are descended from slaves who worked on plantations in Virginia and the Carolinas think they 're several cuts above those who worked farther down , in Georgia and Mississippi and those places . " " They do ? Why ? " " Well "  --  Renee 's tone became playfully mysterious , as it did in class when she was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all goes back to when slaves arrived from Africa or the West Indies at major slave ports , such as Charleston or Newport News . The planters of Virginia and the Carolinas had first choice of the lot , so naturally they picked thep297strongest , the smartest , and the best-looking . Then the other Southern cities had to take what was left over . " " Oh Lord , Renee , is that true ? " " It 's true in that way that never gets written down . I can remember my great-aunt saying once about a friend of hers : ' Maybellesure does put on a lot of airs , for one who 's only descended from Georgia niggers . ' " They both laughed , Lydia a little too loudly , out of nervousness . It still made her uneasy when Renee said " nigger . " " You know , I 've been thinking a lot about ... well , about snobbery , " Lydia confided to Renee . " I feel embarrassed even admitting I 've been thinking about it . Like you said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but everybody thinks about it . I know they do . Nobody wants anyone to look down on them , and everybody likes to have someone to look down on . I wish I knew why . Why do we care what other people think , when good commonsense tells us they 're just as worried about what we think  --  or somebody thinks ? I wonder who the first snob was , anyway . " " I ca n't tell you why we care what other people think , " said Renee , " but I sure can tell you who the first snob was , if that 'll help any . " " You can ? " " Sure . He was a Scotch cobbler 's apprentice . That 's the originof the term . The Scotch took the word from an Old Norse word that meant ' dolt , ' because , as an apprentice , he was expected to make lots of mistakes . " " No ! I do n't believe this ! " exclaimed Lydia happily . " Well , it 's true . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , later , the word ' snob ' came to mean any person belonging to the lower classes . . . . " " Oh , what a good joke on all the snobs today ! Walking around feeling snobbish and not even knowing  --  " " Yeah , it made me feel good , the day I discovered what a snob was , " said Renee . " Then , somewhere along the way , the word got turned around to mean ... just what you said : people who walked around feeling snobbish. "  | " Renee , you 're wonderful . " " No , just educated , " drawled the other , " or attempting to become educated . " She graciously switched subjects . " How 's Leo . Is he still staying home ? " Lydia filled Renee in on the latest , which was only a couple of days ' worth since she had last talked to her friend . " I saw him tonight . Max had taken them to the movies . He really seemed depressed and wanted to go home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and here he was wanting to turn off at nine o'clock . " " It 's very tiring , trying to prove a point , " said Renee . " In high school , I once stayed in my room for three days to wear my parents down . The whole protocol of a protest can tire you out . First you discover you need things that are n't in your room ; then there 's the problem of meals  --  I mean , how hungry should you allow yourself to be when you 're pretending to be beyond food ? And the boredom gets to you , especially if you 're young . I bet Leo 's boring himself . That 's what 's tiring him out . " " But he is n't trying to wear us down . We 're already on his side . He 's protesting something else , I think . He 's protesting the world , for not being fair . " " Well , he might as well get over that , because it 's not always fair , " said Renee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 'll be two weeks tomorrowthat he refused to go back . And I really do think he 's capable of sticking it out . He 's got my stubbornness . But he lacks my expediency . I would n't have let them cause me to lose a semester . I would probably have played their game and despised them quietly . Leo 's more honest . " " Now , do n't start running yourself down . That gets nobody anywhere . But you ought to get him out of that room . Why do n't you bring him to school with you tomorrow ? " " You mean , take him to my classes ? " " Why not ? It 'll be a change . If he 's bored , at least it 'll be a fresh kind of boredom . The more outside influences , the better . If he 'll come . " " Oh , I can get him to come . That 's no problem . Renee ,  |p299you  're just full of good ideas . But why were you trying to wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess you could say it was a draw . I wanted to get engaged to this boy , Navarro . I was madly in love with him ; he was the basketball hero . They did n't think he was good enough . Well , I finally came out of my room , after three days . Like you , I did n't want to miss my school . But Navarro and I continued to go out , and , just about the time I was realizing my parents were right about him , I conceived Camilla . I ended up missing two semestersof school , though , and it did n't ruin my life . That should make you less uptight about Leo . " " My God . What  --  what happened to Navarro ? " " Oh , he 's around . In and out of the state penitentiary . Navarrohas to have action . He was fine as long as he could work it out on the basketball court , but after he graduated from high school he needed more challenges . So he tried embezzlement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has n't killed anybody . I would n't want Camilla 's father to be a murderer . " " Does Camilla ever see him ? " How could anyone ever think life was boring , Lydia was thinking , when there were people like Renee to interpret it for you ? Renee sighed . " She 's seen him . He has this way of coming around . That 's one reason she 's at school in England . She does n't need him waiting outside her school or weeping crocodile tears through the bars of the playground . Not that he would hurt her . He just likes to make scenes . Look here , why do n't you and Leo plan to have lunch with me if you can get him to come tomorrow . I 'd like to meet him . " " I 'm going to phone him right now , " said Lydia . " If he 's asleep , I 'll tell Max to wake him up . " " If he ca n't come tomorrow , you come on and have lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d love to . Either way , though , please let me bring the cold cuts . I can pack them right up tonight in my picnic cooler . " Either way , with or without Leo , it would be fun with Renee . If Leo did n't come , they could talk some more about Navarro ; andp300maybe some about Stanley ; linking it all together via the subject of Eros : troublesome old Eros  --  " Friend or Foe , " fool or felon . But as much as Lydia admired everything else about Renee , she had to protect herself against her friend 's weird " salad " combinations . That tuna and vinegar and chick-pea thing , the first time ; the mango and green-bean combination , the second time . After that , Lydia had protected herself  --  and Renee 's pride  --  with a little white lie . Lydia said it made her feel bad , always having lunch at Renee 's when she lived too far away to have her back . She 'd feel better if they could have indoor picnics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet asleep when Lydia called . Despite his nonchalantmonotone , it was clear he felt rescued from one more dull day with his principles . No sooner had she hung up than the phone rang again . My sweet Stanley . My reward for coping with all the trials in my life ? It was Renee again . " Is he coming ? " " He 's coming , " said Lydia . " Then here 's an update on tomorrow 's plans . I talked to Calvin . He says for us to come on over to the TV station around three and he 'll show Leo around the studio , and then at four they 're taping part of a Mary McGregor Turnbull show . You ever watch that ? Southern Kitchens ? The other guys at the station call it ' Southern Kitsch , ' but Calvin has a soft spot for old Miss Mary . Has Leo ever watched a show being taped before ? Calvin thought it might interest him . " " It would . It would interest me ; I 've never seen one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that was years ago . That Mary McGregor Turnbull must be ancient . I always like a good cooking program . But the strange thing was , on her show , they never showed the finished product , the times I watched . " Renee laughed . " Honey , that was because they almost never turned out right . They were going to take her show off the air , but Calvin rescued it . He put new life in that show , and he solved the problem you spoke of . The recipes always turn out now . " She giggled . " You wait and see . "  | " I 'm really looking forward to tomorrow , " said Lydia . She was a little disappointed that Renee had n't been Stanley , but you could n't have everything in one day . " I could tell from Leo 's voice , though he was playing it cool , that he 's looking forward to getting outside that house . " " We 'll broaden his horizons , " promised Renee . " At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old record to death . " It was not , as it turned out , " another beautiful spring day , " but as Lydia drove through the pouring rain , her windshield wipers on high speed , to fetch Leo , she was determined to make the day count . The rain slowed them down on their thirty-mile stretch of I-40 , and they were late for General Psychology I. The instructor was lecturing on William James 's belief in Voluntarism . There were n't two seats left together and Leo ducked self-effacingly into a backseat before Lydia could stop him . She had to take a seat up front and was unable to watch his reactions . That was a shame , because the instructor , an earnest young man  --  younger than Lydia  --  who often came to class with sleep flakes in the corners of his eyelashes , warmed to his topic today . " James , more than any other major American psychologist , apotheosized the human will , " the instructor told them . His eyes kept returning to a certain spot in the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leo was sitting . The class was a large one and maybe he was trying to figure out if Leo had been a student he had overlooked all semester . " James believed that many of our desires can be achieved , at least in part , as a result of desiring them . But he struggled all his life against his own depression and even made a doctrine out of it . ' Life in extremis ' was one of his favoriteterms . He described himself as one who welcomed a bit of tension  --  or , as he put it , ' a stinging pain in the breastbone . ' " " Life in extremis , " Lydia wrote quickly in her notebook . " Desiresachieved as result of desiring . " " A stinging pain in the breastbone . " So far , she had an A in this course . The next hour was History of Female Consciousness . Not having been forewarned about Leo 's aversion to being picked out in a crowd , Renee had introduced him to the class ; whereupon ,  |p302he  immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demographic makeup of the class ( at least 90 percent women , a substantial portion of whom were older townswomen , some of them auditors , and old enough to be Leo 's mother or grandmother ) ; it was partly because of the topic under discussion : Moon priestesses and priests in ancient cultures . All the older women looked anxiously toward Leo , as if fearing for his soul , while the hieros gamos rites of sacred prostitution were being discussed ; the minority of men in the class could be seen , in a body , swerving their eyes protectively in Leo 's direction while the Phrygian rites for choosing new priests for Cybele were being discussed . Even Lydia shuddered at the thought of young men in an orgiastic frenzy cutting off their sex organs and then running through the streets and flinging these organs at houses . Whoseverhouse got hit had to supply the new eunuch priest with women 's clothes for him to wear in the temple . Lydia looked over at Leo , whose cheeks were pink with their usual high color , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a good diplomat , thought Lydia , or gambler ; at the same time she ached at the thought of his vulnerable male organs , which would , from now on , live their own life and make their special demands on him , causing him much longing and confusion . " That was kind of heavy , Leo , " said Renee , when the three of them  --  four , counting The Judge  --  were eating Lydia 's cold cuts over at Renee 's . " I hope it was n't too heavy . " " Oh , it was interesting , " said Leo , eating with one hand and caressing The Judge 's silver-blue forehead with the other . " Everybody is so quiet in college . " " Quiet ? " asked Lydia . " Yes . Everybody listens to the teacher . Nobody interrupts anybody else when they 're trying to talk . " Lydia and Renee exchanged a look . Lydia said , " That's. because we want to find out what 's going on . Especially us oldtimers , who 've wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his school and did n't even know it . Renee went away and came back with an envelope . " I 've gotp303some new pictures of Camilla . They 're quite good . Her roommatefrom Persia took them with some fancy camera . My daughter , Camilla , is just your age , Leo ; she 's at school over in England . " " So Mom said . " They all looked at the photographs . In several , Camilla was jumping a horse , her thick pigtail flying out behind her derby . Her lips were set in a cool , confident smile , but her eyes were round with excitement and a touch of terror . " She 's so elegant , Renee , " said Lydia . " Look at the way she sits on that horse . " " Yeah , but you know what ? The poor child says her teeth chatter the whole hour before riding lesson . But she just plops on that hard hat and goes right on . " Leo looked carefully at each of the photographs but made no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought Lydia . I hope we 're not overloading his circuits . Life in extremis with WilliamJames ; young men flinging their severed organs at people 's houses ; and now this black girl dressed like Princess Anne , leapingher fences . Why , come to think of it , this is probably the first time in Leo 's life he 's met a black person like Renee , a person who is black but " one of us . " But he must have liked something about Renee 's , because , when given the choice of going with his mother to her Survey of Renaissance Lit class or staying behind with The Judge , he chose the latter . Lydia rushed away in the rain to Professor Spruill 's class . She was a little disappointed because she had been especiallyeager to introduce her pretty Leo to the old man : Professor Spruill would have approved so of Leo 's grave beauty . But this was Leo 's day , after all . She would skip Economics so they could go to the TV station and have their tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . The class had thinned dangerously since they 'd begun " The Faerie Queene " ; everybody was skippingout on the dreary sessions , crammed full of all those lateTudorimperial and ecclesiastical trappings . But as Professor Spruill had said , " The Faerie Queene " was the heroic farewell to an empire , and Lydia wanted to pay her respects  --  just as youp304would want to attend the funeral of some famous person who had influenced history . She would always be grateful that they had still been living in London when Churchill had died . Max had arranged for them to watch the funeral procession from an upstairs window of his solicitor 's office in Piccadilly . She would never forget Field Marshal Montgomery , seventy-eight years old , doing a slow march ( which Max said was extremely painful , even for young legs ) behind Churchill 's coffin , all the way from WestminsterAbbey to St. Paul 's Cathedral . Calvin Edwards , Renee 's friend Calvin , whom she had once described to Lydia as a fellow pilgrim on the upwardly mobile trip , awaited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a large , round-faced black man  --  much blacker than Renee  --  with easy , expansive , almost floppy gestures ; but his eyes were intently watchful , rather Machiavelian . It would have been hard to judge his age , but Lydia knew it was the same as her own . Calvin flutteredover them protectively , making them assure him nobody had gotten too wet in the rain ; he caressed Renee verbally with his rich bass voice . ( " How 's it going , gal ? " ) and told Lydia and Leo they " favored each other strikingly , " making it quite clear it was a compliment to them both . He was dressed in well-pressed chino pants , a red-and-white-checked gingham shirt worn on the outside to conceal a potbelly , blue topsiders which gave him a stealthy , soft-footed walk , and a lightweight blue windbreaker with CAROLINA FOOTBALL printed across the back : clothes as loose and casual as his deportment . But the eyes took constant scans of their little group , assessing , judging , almost mind-reading , it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discomfort on Lydia 's part ( her hair had been blown during the walk from the car , under the umbrella , and she was feeling untidy ) and he said , " Listen , folks , if anybody wants the Ladies or Gents , I suggest the ones right here , off the visitors ' lobby ; they 've got more amenitiesthan the ones upstairs . " " I think I will just  --  " said Lydia gratefully , and went off to set right her appearance ; Leo , seeing her go , decided he neededp305the Gents . He was shy about making conversation with adults he had just met . When they returned , Calvin and Renee were waiting in companionable silence , Renee with her usual air of cool insouciance , Calvin in his relaxed , loose-limbed manner . The two of them were together , that much was obvious , but Lydia found herself suspecting they had not had much more fun on their trip to New Orleans than she and Max had had . Calvin spread his long arms and bundled them into the elevator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm everybody up with a cup of my special tea . Surprising , is n't it , how rain like this can chill , even in May ? " He broadened his i 's , Northern-style , and sounded his final g 's as if striking a gong , but he blocked his phrases in Southern rhythms . Meanwhile , back and forth , up and down , went the ever-watchful brown eyes , canvassing his little group . As if , thought Lydia , he has to keep an eye on all our thoughts . As he led them down a fluorescent-lit hall , a man 's voice called from a darkened room , " Hey , Calvin , you giving the twenty-five-cent tour or the fifty-cent tour ? " " These folks are so special I 'm making up a new tour , Ernie , and it begins with you . You all come on in and meet Ernie . " And Calvin ushered his brood into the dark room , where three men sat , relaxed , behind a long control panel . The one named Ernie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were smoking . On the picture monitors opposite them were a soap opera in progress , a bar of colors , a cake-mix ad , and some black-andwhitefootage of a tobacco auction : all silent . The rest of the screens were blank . Calvin carefully introduced everybody to everybody else . His eyes moved faster , as there were three more people to scan . But , on the surface , everything was a joke . " Now officially , folks , " said Calvin to his guests , " this is the control room where we build the local evening news . These gentlemen are setting things up  --  the films , tapes , charts , graphics , all those things that seem part of the news , but can be set up beforehand . But whatp306these men are really doing is watching the soaps . Ernie here has n't missed an episode of General Hospital in years . That 's what 's on the master monitor now . Only , Ernie 's wife tells me , when they go on vacation every year , she lets him watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Ernie tossed his Diet Pepsi into a wastebasket . " Takes one to know one , Calvin , " he joked . In his small , windowless office , which Calvin had neverthelessarranged to resemble a gracious parlor , he explained to them the importance of " goofing off " for TV people . " Those guys looked pretty relaxed , Leo , would n't you say ? " ( A quick look at Lydia , which read : See , I 'm making your son the center of things ; I know all about his problems . ) " Kind of , " Leo admitted . " Well , " said Calvin , spooning five teaspoons of tea into a teapot with dragons on it , " you go back to that room in two hours , you 'd see something else . You 'd see a highly calibrated technical unit , working controls , speaking in code , every action timed to a mini second . No time for jokes , no room for mistakes . " To Lydia , he said , " This water ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inside an authentic samovar , not one of those fake ones that have to be plugged into an outlet . Lydia saw that her admiration for its genuineness was not lost on Calvin . " That man I introduced you to , named Ernie , " Calvin went on , ostensibly to Leo , " is one of our highest-paid men . They pay him because he does n't make mistakes . Conversely , he 's the biggest goof-off when he 's not on the air . He 's got to be , to break the tension . Ernie 's one of the most talented news producersin the state ; if he had to , he could build the evening news around the death of a June bug . " Calvin refastened his little bag of tea and put it back on a small butler 's table ; the bag 's label was turned so Lydia could read that Calvin ordered his tea from McNulty 's in New York . " What happens if you make a mistake ? " Leo wanted to know.  | " Well , after you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job  --  like selling vacuum cleaners . Mistakes cost too much money in this business . You know that soap I was kidding Ernie about , General Hospital ? Well , it costs sixty thousand dollars just to make one episode of a show like General Hospital . " The water was boiling in the samovar . Calvin opened the brass tap , and scalding water steamed into the waiting pot . To Lydia , he said , " Renee tells me you lived in London for a while . Did you pick up the habit of using milk in your tea ? If so , I 'll get some for you from our communal refrigerator . " " No , thank you , " said Lydia . " Perfectly plain for me . " " Leo ? " " Same here , " said Leo , who hated tea but would drink it out of politeness to his host . Lydia saw that on Calvin 's wall , beside a small framed diplomafrom the RCA Institute , there was a Carolina Playmakers poster of a 1968 production of Look Homeward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you went to Chapel Hill , " she said . " Got my M.A. there , " said Calvin in his resonant , chesty bass . " Did my undergraduate work right here , over at Ag Tech . I 'm a Greensboro boy . " He checked his Accutron watch . " Tell you what , I 'm going to go ahead and pour out this tea , even though it 's only been three minutes . You wo n't tell the Queen on me , will you , Lydia ? " Calvin poured out tea into thin china cups and passed them to his guests . " What kind of mistake would you have to make , for instance ? " Leo wanted to know . " Before you had to go and sell vacuumcleaners . " " Oh , " said Calvin , " well , there are the technical mistakes . But it 's mostly the beginners that make those , and they 're not in the position to do much harm . Then there are the big mistakes . The biggest mistake of all is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show you 're going to see me tape part of in about half an hour was on its way to being one of those shows when I took it over . "  | " Calvin rescued the Mary McGregor Turnbull show , " put in Renee , who had been keeping a low profile so her new friends could get to know her old friend . " Let 's say I saw its potential , " corrected Calvin modestly , sipping his tea . " There is a need for a show like Miss Mary 's , but my predecessor had n't quite found the focus . He had more of a radio mentality . He was wasting what Miss Mary had to give and forcing her to give what she did n't have . " " This is marvelous tea , " said Lydia . It was : a fruity , spicy tea . " What did she have and what did n't she have ? By the way , I saw that show once , years ago , I was telling Renee ; Mary McGregor Turnbull was doing syllabub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardened . That was before your time , I bet . Renee says you have a foolproof method now . " " I do . I have a caterer . He delivers whatever Miss Mary 's been whipping up , in an identical container , and she takes it out of the oven , or refrigerator , or whatever . Sometimes Miss Mary 's concoctions do come out okay , but we save shooting time by using the caterer . Would you believe , my predecessor used to wait for Miss Mary 's recipes to cook ? ' You boys take a break , ' he 'd tell the cameramen , ' and come back in fifty-five minutes when this banana pudding is done , ' he 'd say . Can you beat that ? The guy had no video mentality whatsoever . Furthermore , here was Miss Mary , not only a fabulous raconteur and walking historybook , able to get into any home in North Carolina , and he has her read Mrs. Reynolds Tobacco 's recipe for peach cobbler , he has her read Mrs. Burlington Mills ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program  --  the name he picked  --  is all but hitting him in the eye with the potentialities . Southern Kitchens ; and there he is , making Miss Mary squint at the studio TelePrompTer to read off Mrs. Reynolds Tobacco 's or Mrs. BurlingtonMills ' favorite recipe when the viewers are dying to get into those houses the only way they can  --  through Miss Mary and our cameras  --  and find out whether Mrs. Burlington Mills uses a chopping board or a butcher-block table to chop her celery , and whether Mrs. Reynolds Tobacco 's copper-bottom pansp309are shiny enough to hang from pegboard hooks , or whether she has to hide them under the sink . " " Everyone likes to see into other people 's houses , " agreed Lydia . " It 's human nature . " " What happened to your predecessor ? " Leo asked Calvin . " Is he selling vacuum cleaners ? " Calvin 's resonant , chesty laugh vibrated through the small room . He gave Lydia a look which read : Is n't your boy something ? A look Leo was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ought to be ! " He checked his watch again . " What you all are going to be watching us tape this afternoon is the studio part of a show we 've already taped most of down in Beaufort . There 's a fantastic old man there , retired Coast Guard , lives in the same house his Huguenotancestors built back in the seventeen-hundreds . Miss Mary and I went over with a crew to get his recipe for a crabmeat souffle that 's just out of this world . " " And have a look around his old house ? " asked Lydia . " You got it , " said Calvin . " Those old houses in Beaufort are something to see . Do you know Beaufort ? " " We have a summer cottage right across Pamlico Sound , " said Lydia . " On Ocracoke . " " Hey , is n't that where Blackbeard the Pirate lived ? " asked Calvin . " He died there , too , " said Leo . " He was run to ground right in his own hideout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teach 's Hole from my granddaddy 's cottage . " " It 'll be your cottage one of these days , " Lydia told him . " You know , " said Calvin , taking them all in with a look that announced confidential intent , " we 're all North Carolinians here , so I can say this . I believe our state has the most interesting past and the most exciting future of any state in the Union . After I completed my courses up at the RCA Institute , they wanted to give me a job as assistant director over at NBC ; but I thanked them very much and said I thought I 'd get on back down here where the air is good and I know my way around . I like the culturalopportunities in New York , but those people up there arep310too tired and cynical ; they get off too much on decadence and catastrophe . There 's something self-righteous about the way they assure you they 're right at the center of all the decay . Well , who wants to be right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be back in the Old North State , where there 's still room enough to turn around in and we still have hope . No wonder a million new people a year are moving to the South , and a great proportion of them to North Carolina . And what with the new communications satellites we 've got now , and the prospects very soon of cheap light-wave cable , nobody 's going to have to live in New York to have themselves a network . " " Calvin wants himself a network , " drawled Renee , with a fond , if rather platonic , look at her friend . " Well ? What 's the point of dreaming if you do n't dream big ? " said Calvin . " My dream is a cultural network . There 'd always be something worth watching , just as there 's always somethingworth reading in a good library . I 'd rely on subscribers and endowments . " To Lydia , he said , " Do n't you think , just within this area of the state , what with all our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could drum up enough support for one dial on the TV set where there would always be something worth watching ? Do n't you think we 've got enough people right here in the Piedmont who know what 's good ? " He made it clear with his eyes that he thought Lydia was one of these people . " I want to think so , " Lydia told him . " It 's certainly a dream worth pursuing . " " Thank you , " said Calvin , with a gracious nod . " I need all the encouragement I can get . Now , folks , let 's go on down to the studio and meet Miss Mary . " It was a small studio , but very modern , Calvin explained to them , pointing out the expensive , computerized color cameras , already set in place around a " kitchen " area . Calvin explained , ostensibly to Leo , to whom he directed all technical information in the old " man-to-man " style , how the floor of this studio hadp311been specially leveled so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture when a camera rolled across it . There were three cameras , a complicated array of overhead lights , at least ten people running around looking very knowledgeableand indispensable , and , all by herself in a corner , a small blue-haired lady with a face like an angry mastiff 's ; she wore a cotton-print shirtwaist dress , circa 1959 , and sat forward on a velvet Empire sofa  --  obviously a prop for some other show . She had a carton of eggs open on the marble-topped coffee table before her , and was in the process of breaking one egg after another , not very neatly , and trying to separate the whites from the yolks , not very successfully , into two glass bowls . " Calvin , " she called , in a gruff , peremptory voice , as soon as she saw the producer approaching with his friends , " how come you trapped me into doing a recipe that calls for nine eggs ? You know my arthritis . And I never could break an egg right , anyway , even in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she said " prime , " and you could see the eyes of a girlish flirt still exercisingtheir rights through the old and wrinkled lids . She took in Calvin 's visitors but did not acknowledge them . " I brought this box of eggs from home , " she told Calvin , " to practice on , before the show . I know how it throws you into a tizzy to go over your budget . And I do n't intend to waste these eggs , either . I 'll just eat scrambled eggs for the next week , that 's all . " Lydia had met at least a score of old ladies like Miss Mary in her life . No matter how old or dotty or ravaged in the flesh they became , they kept faith with their own arrogance . It was an arrogancebuilt on the rock-safe foundation of Who One Was and it kept them in love with themselves even after everybody else who knew who that was had died ; it kept them in love with themselvestill they died . But , unlike Cate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Lydia had often thought what a pity it was that Theodora Blount had not been her godmother  --  she would have known how to handle Aunt Thea . She rather admired these old dragons , the way they took charge . And had this way of knowing they were right . It was better to be a dragon when youp312were old than it was to be a meek , quaking sheep ; that way you still retained some power over others , just as Miss Mary retained power over Calvin , who was now humoring her the way you would a petulant movie star ( " Now , Miss Mary , you know and I know that nobody traps you into doing anything you do n't want to be trapped into doing . Have you taken your Arthritis Pain Formula ? " ) And yet , thought Lydia , Calvin had " saved " this old dragon 's show . But she could understand why he would want to . It would provide a certain gratification to a North Carolinian like Calvin to save a fellow North Carolinian like Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Mary could provide entree into the houses that would most likely contain the people who , as Calvin had put it , " knew what was good . " " You 've met my friend Renee Peverell-Watson , " Calvin told Miss Mary , " and now I 'd like to present Lydia Mansfield and her son , Leo Mansfield . Lydia is taking Renee 's class over at the college , and Leo came along for the day . " Mary McGregor Turnbull nodded graciously toward Renee . She turned slightly on her velvet sofa and gave Lydia and Leo the once-over . Lydia went forward and offered her hand , and , as she said , " How do you do , Miss Turnbull , " she dipped a small curtsy . She was careful not to squeeze the old hand , since it was acting up with arthritis . Miss Mary narrowed her eyes at Lydia . " Where are you from ? " she demanded . " Well , I live in Winston-Salem now , but originally I 'm from Mountain City , " said Lydia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in summer , when I was a girl , " said the old lady , " We went for the climate . My father was never really well after he came home from the War . The Spanish-American War , I 'm talking about . You have to specify wars so carefully today , or nobody knows which one you 're talking about . I take it Mansfield is your married name , if that good-looking boy is your son . " " Yes , ma'am , " said Lydia . " My maiden name was Strick-land. "  | " Strickland . " The old lady narrowed her eyes in concentration . " There was a George Strickland , used to play poker with my older brother , Royall ; he was a lawyer , I believe , and he smoked the most awful-smelling cigar . " " That sounds like my grandfather , " said Lydia . " His name was George , he was a lawyer , and he smoked an awful cigar . So I 'm told . He died right after I was born . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royall is dead , too . Of course he was much older than I. Are you a good cook ? I 'm not . I lie awake nights marveling over the fact that here I am with a cooking show  --  I 've had a cooking show for fifteen years  --  and I 'm not even a tolerable cook . But I have quite a following , you know . I get letters . I have fans . Especially since Calvin took over . So I guess I must have something else . " " You have presence , Miss Mary , " said Calvin . " You have charisma . " His eyes had been working overtime , keeping track of all the personal dynamics going on , as well as the preparations in the studio . He looked at his watch . " You about ready to start , Miss Mary ? Do n't worry about the eggs . Tell you what . You do the best you can . One out of nine is bound to come out right . We 'll just repeat that shot nine times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the old lady . " We sure are cutting a lot of honesty corners . I still do n't feel completely right about reaching into that oven and taking out what the man from the catering truck 's just sneaked in one minute ago . " She looked at Lydia . " Can you break an egg ? Even in your prime ? " " It 's one of the few things I learned how to do at this Cordon Bleu cooking class I took once , " said Lydia . " They taught you to clean up as you went , how to make little ridges in a potato so it would roast better , and how to break an egg using only one hand . Those were the first things we learned . After that , it got more complicated . But I love to cook . I do n't know how good I am , but  --  " " Come here and sit beside me , " said the old lady , patting a place on the hard Empire sofa , " and do show me how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down , tucked the corners of her skirt beneath her ,  |p314|picked  up a brown egg from Miss Mary 's carton , and cracked it in half with a single deft movement of her wrist . She held the two parts , still connected by a thin membrane , poised over the bowl Miss Mary had been using for her whites . " Do you want it separated , or what ? " Although there was a shocking amount of yolk in Miss Mary 's bowl of whites . " How fascinating , " said Miss Mary . " How truly fascinating . " There was reverence in her tone . She looked up at Calvin and cocked her blue-tinted coiffure to one side . " Why ca n't you let this little girl from Mountain City stay down here in the studiowith me and help me break my eggs on the show ? " she wheedled . There flashed across the producer 's countenance an ill-concealedlook of annoyance . He glanced , this time pointedly , at his watch . " Well , Miss Mary , it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , pshaw , " retorted Mary McGregor Turnbull , who had chosen not to notice Calvin 's disapproval . " We 've already done three fourths of the show down in Beaufort at Captain LaForgue'shouse . All that 's left is for me to pretend to be making the Captain 's souffle . She can break the eggs and I can mix up that crabmeat stuff and we can talk , just like any two people in the kitchen . Any two civilized people can talk . " Lydia sat , still holding the egg . Everyone 's eyes were upon her . Calvin said , " I asked Lydia and her son Leo here as guests , Miss Mary . " " Well , " said the old lady triumphantly . " She can be my guest down here in the studio and he can be your guest up in the control room . " Calvin groaned . But it was a token sort of groan . He said to Lydia , " Have you ever been in front of a TV camera before ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to try . If I can be of help . " . Her heart began to thud , but nobody could feel that but herself . " Good girl ! " exclaimed Mary McGregor Turnbull . " We 'll have us a fine time , " she told Lydia , turning her back on Calvin , who was already motioning for the makeup girl . " There 's noth/ing to it , " the old lady told Lydia , sotto voce . " It 's not at all intimidating , like the theater . I mean , there 's nobody out there , in television . Not a live , breathing audience , like the theater . And if they 're not live and breathing , why should anybody take any account of them ? That 's my theory . Now what did you say your married name was , again ? " Thus , Lydia found herself on television . A little microphone was clipped to the open collar of her cotton-knit polo dress ; she felt the heat from the lights through a matte veil of makeup ( but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of it off ) ; she somehow , thank the Lord , managed to break all nine eggs into elegant , still-connected halves and separate them , without mixing any yolks with whites . And she did it with one hand , at the same time chatting with Miss Mary about sundry topics : how she , Lydia , had decided to take the Cordon Bleu cooking classes in London because , as a new bride , she had been terribly lonely with Max away at the Bank all day , and she thought it would be better to learn some fancy recipes than to stay home feeling sorry for herself ; how she had started back to school now , in her thirty-sixth year , " and , frankly , I 'm not sorry I did things in the order I did them . I enjoyed being young when my children were growing up ; it was more fun for us all that way ; and I find I can concentrate better in college now than I could eighteen years ago . " She told how she had brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he 'd get a taste of what 's in store for him when he goes to college , " but did not mention , or even allude to , the fact she was separated . That was nobody 's business . Especially if as Miss Mary said  --  there was nobody out there , anyway . Lydia tended to agree with Miss Mary 's theory . When all you could see was blazing light and the lenses of some big cameras , how could you " take account " of anything but what you were doing , or of anybody but yourself and what you were saying ? Lydia could n't even see her friends , or her own son , up in the control room . " You know , " said Mary McGregor Turnbull to her guest , Mrs. Lydia Mansfield , " there 's a mystery about Mountain Cityp316that has always intrigued me . Since it 's your hometown , maybe you can tell me the answer . " The egg yolks had been poured into the crabmeat mixture , the whites had been whipped to stiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the recipe had been folded and transferredinto sixteen individual bakers , which Miss Mary , assisted by her guest , had placed upon a baking sheet and put into the preheated oven . Now they were " waiting " for their recipe  --  or rather , Captain LaForgue 's recipe , which was his " company " recipe , proportioned especially for annual LaForgue clan gatherings at the old bachelor 's house ; the floor manager had motioned that Lydia and Miss Mary had one minute and a half left of their " waiting " period . Then there would be a cut , and the men from the catering truck , already waiting outside the door , with sixteen identical souffles , would hustle the delicately risen props from the truck 's ovens into the studio 's . And the cameras would roll again as Miss Mary opened the oven and took out the souffles she had not put in . " What is the mystery ? " asked Lydia . She thought it was a shame that their souffles would n't ever have a chance to rise ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary . " You 're too young to remember the old Battery Park Hotel . It sat up on this enormous hill . It was called Battery Porter Hill ; or sometimes Porter 's Battery Hill . Then they tore down that old hotel and built a brick one in its place , but whatever happened to that hill underneath ? We came back one summer and the whole hill was gone . I never could figureout how they got rid of that hill or why anybody would want to get rid of it . " " It just so happens I can solve your mystery , " said Lydia . She could not keep from smiling . The old lady really did n't know ? " They leveled that hill for two reasons : first , to give more space to the growing business center of town ; and second , to use the dirt to fill a big ravine just at the edge of the business center , because it was dangerous and ugly . But , years later , the bus stationbuilt its new depot where this ravine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the pilings sank . My father was the law/yer who represented the bus station and won the case against the architects . My sister and I were allowed to skip school to go and hear his final argument in court . My father said , ' If we ca n't trust our foundations , what can we trust ? ' " Lydia felt her eyes go bright with pride and emotion ; she had completely forgotten she was on TV , until Miss Mary clapped her hands and exclaimed , " Indeed ! How very true ! Well , Mrs. Mansfield , I 'm sure our viewers will all agree you have been a very charming ... and very serendipitous guest . " Miss Mary winked right into the lens of the nearest camera . " And thank you for clearing up my little mystery . That vanished hill has worried me for years . " Why , the old fraud , thought Lydia , she is aware of an audienceout there every minute . Unaccountably , Lydia began to shake just as the floor manager brought his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over . " You were great , " Leo told his mother as they drove home on the Interstate . It was rush hour , and the rain was still falling lightly : the most treacherous combination of driving conditions . Lydia had to keep braking and changing lanes . There was a little knot of tension at the base of her neck . She leaned back against the headrest , without removing her eyes from the road . " I do n't know about great , " she said . " Just so I did n't make a fool of myself . What a day ! My mind feels like that dark room we went into , with all those monitors showing different pictures , all going on at once . Was I really all right ? " " More than all right . Calvin said you looked like you 'd been doing it all your life . He was worried , at first . But then , after things got going , he chose more shots of you than he did of her . " " He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard him tell the director . The monitors have numbers on them and he kept saying he wanted the numbers you were in . Oh , and he said you did n't have any bad angles . Renee thought you were terrific , too . " " Well , just so I did n't embarrass you , " said Lydia . " There was one terrible moment  --  just after Miss Mary said she wanted me to be on the show  --  when I panicked . I had to decide whichp318would be worse : to go on the show and make a fool of myself in front of you , or to beg off and have you think I was a coward . It did n't take long to make up my mind . " " You cared about what I thought ? " " Well , of course , " Lydia said . It was true , she had thought first of what Leo would think ; and then the others , too , but Leo was such a perfectionist . " Of course I cared . Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , Leo said , " I guess I do . " They drove in silence for a while . Both of them were exhausted . Lydia wondered what Stanley was doing , right that second ; wait till she told him she was on TV . Maybe they could watch the program together ; Calvin had said all her angles were good . Leo , looking out of the window on his side , said , " Then you think it 's worse to be a coward than to make a fool of yourself ? " " Oh , absolutely . Say I had made a fool of myself "  --  and Lydia 's stomach clutched ( partly because they had all crammed themselves full of the crabmeat souffles  --  the ones made by the caterers  --  before they fell ) as she imagined all the ways she might have been laughable . " Even if I had , I would at least have known I had had the guts to try . But if I had refused to try , I would always be wondering what it would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moaning , ' Oh , if only I 'd done such-and-such , my whole life would have been different . ' Well , I do n't want to be like that . If you get into the habit of retreatingfrom challenges , you 're just a sitting duck for regrets . When I get old , I do n't want to be trapped in a room with a lot of old regrets . " She was thinking of what she was going to fix for Dickie 's supper to make it up to him for having been off on all these adventureswith Leo . If it had been Dickie with her today , they would now be having an animated , gossipy analysis of Calvin and Renee , the " new North Carolinian " that Calvin represented , and the interesting trade-offs apparent in Calvin 's relationship with Miss Mary . But Leo did not go in for that kind of talk . She was also watching the slick road for their safety . And she wasp319frankly basking in how well everything had gone : the classes , the way Leo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been " great , " " terrific , " on TV , " as if she 'd been doing it all her life . " She really had no ulterior motive as she preached her small sermon on how it was better to risk contempt than to be a coward . With so many separate pictures of the day going all at once on the overcrowded monitor system in her brain , she had forgotten , for the moment , the reason for this mother-son outing : the Cookie Cunningham soap opera was not , for the moment , on any of Lydia 's channels . But when she thought of it later , after she had dropped Leo off at his father 's , she said to herself , That was a rather appropriateconversation for us to have had ; now , if only he 'll apply it to his life and go back to school . But you could n't control which , out of a day 's events , would lodge themselves in your child 's memory , to apply to his life and maybe alter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightening aspects of being a parent : you never knew what a child was going to remember , or how he was going to remember it . Leo spent the weekend working on his suntan and shooting a lot of vigorous , thoughtful baskets . On Monday , he ate breakfast with his father , spent the next hour blow-drying his hair , and arrived at school just after Mrs. Epting 's loosely structured Social Studies hour was ended . He was polite to Cookie , asked after her health and said he was sorry she had suffered , but he never took her out again . He never went back to Mrs. Epting 's class . He forced her to fail him , which seemed to give the teacher more pain that it gave him : that compassionate Mrs. Epting who was known to take pity and pass any student who showed up for class and " made an effort . " Leo would make up the Social Studiesin summer school , he told his parents . And even though The Ghouls were a trio once again , Leo was adamant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' school , if possible . He liked girls , he said , but he was tired of mixing everything up . Maybe he could go to school in England ? After all , he had been born in England.  |p320Lydia  naturally gave herself some credit for Leo 's return to school . And she gave some to Renee and Calvin , and told them so , which pleased them very much , though Renee said : " He just needed to get out and see there was more to the world , that 's all . He was boring himself to death in that room . " In later years , Lydia was to construct a very inspiring successstory , based on this day 's events , about how , if you believed in yourself and did what you were supposed to be doing at the time and place you were supposed to be doing it , your destiny sometimes came right up and tapped you on your shoulder . She was referring to herself . The people who admired Lydia , and found her an inspirationand a model , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how it had all begun to happen for her . The people who did not admire Lydia , who felt she had neither earned nor deserved her " destiny , " found the story tiresome . But , as she became more influential , she grew less concerned about what these people thought , though she was never to conquerher concern entirely . Indeed , she came right out and admittedit , which ( her admirers said ) made her more lovable . " But if you do anything in this life , " she would say , " anything worth doing , that is , you are bound to make some enemies . "  |p323Nell  drove out to Meadowland Mall  --  formerly Crabtree Meadows , where she had picnicked as a schoolgirl  --  to buy a bathing suit for the trip to the Outer Banks . Lydia would be driving up on Monday , and they would leave early Tuesday morning . But there had been a last-minute change in plans : now Cate would be coming , too . Cate 's college had gone bankrupt and Cate was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until she could find herself a new job . Nell expected Cate to arrive around midday tomorrow . Cate had called a week ago to announce this , and to ask if she might live in the cottage at Ocracoke for the summer . She had sounded both demanding and on the defensive , as if she were daring her mother to deny her request . Nell did not deny it , because Cate had sounded almost desperate . Who would deny her daughter the use of a beach cottage if the daughter had no other place to live ? Of course , that meant upsetting Lydia 's plans about renting the cottage , but , as Lydia had been doing this ( on Max 's advice ) to save Nell trouble , Nell really had not expected Lydia to blow up as she had . " But I do n't see what choice I had , " Nell told Lydia , " other than to ask her to move in with me ; and I do n't think that would have suited either of us . " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ap324perfect right to mess up everybody else 's plans . It 's going to mess up your whole year 's tax benefits if she lives there . If a family member lives for more than a certain percentage of the year in a vacation home , then the IRS wo n't let you claim it as a rental . It says so in the pamphlet Max gave me . " " She could hardly plan for her school to go bankrupt , " said Nell . " They only told everybody for sure at the last minute . " " Oh Mother ! She was talking about it last December when ... when she was here . We sat right in the living room , before we went to see you at the hospital , and she said it might close , and if it did she might not get another teaching job for a while . She said she might try something else . Well , how do you know she wo n't decide to take up ... crabbing or something ? She might be living in Daddy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to inject some humanity into things . And also to set a few priorities straight . She was slightly repelled by Lydia 's hard , " business " tone . " I think you and Max are worrying yourself too much about things you do n't need to worry about , " Nell said . " I 'm richer than I 've ever been in my life . I have more money than I need . I can certainly afford to give up some ' tax benefits . ' Especially if it means giving my daughter a place to live . You have a place to live ; I have a place to live . Would you want your sister not to have one ? And besides , it 's just until she gets herself sorted out , she said . She sounded as though she 's had a hard spring . Besides , I do n't believe she could stick it out on that island for more than a few months . She 's too restless . Do n't you remember how she was always so ecstatic to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swore she was never going to leave , and then she 'd be the first one to be ready to leave ? " In the silence that followed , Nell could all but hear the retortsthat sprang to Lydia 's mind , and which Lydia then rejected . That Lydia might think , but not voice , these things , restored Nell 's faith in Lydia 's basic goodness . In Nell 's opinion , Lydia had grown more exacting and bossy since she had left Max , and since Leonard had died . ( Was it some compensation for the loss of these men in her life : that she thought she had to be " the man "  |p325now  ? ) But as long as Lydia 's tact and loyalty and basic good judgment continued to overrule her tendencies toward authoritarianism , she would be okay . In many ways , Lydia 's sentiments concerning Cate paralleled Nell 's own , but it would have been a violation of some mutually held value for them to discuss these sentiments in too much detail . As a child , Lydia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complain against her sister ; hut when she became an adult she gracefully relinquished these rights . She established for herself a certain measure of superiorityby refusing to name  --  beyond a point  --  the things in Cate that gave them all such pain and trouble . Lydia even defended Cate , on occasion . " Well , " Lydia had said finally , " I guess she 's not the only one who had a hard spring . I mean , you had to . . . to adjust , and a l l . . . and if anybody had more complications in their life than I had , I 'd sure like to know about it . But I tried to keep things under control , and to a large extent , I 'm relieved to say , I succeeded . I had been looking forward to this trip , I really had . " " But we 're still going , are n't we ? " " Well , yes , but ... it wo n't be the same . " There crept into Lydia 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you and I have never been anywhere just by ourselves . Do you realize that , Mother ? " Nell , surprised , thought back . Good God , was it true ? Had there always been someone else around ? But there was always someone else around when you were a family ; surely Lydia , with her own family , knew that now . It was always a balancing act : so much attention to one , then , quickly ! compensate the other by paying attention to him . She said , " We 'll find time to be alone , honey . Wait and see . And you and Cate should go off together some , too . I think you two could enjoy and benefit from each other if you had some real time together . Besides , I have selfish reasons . If you two are n't f riends , then when I 'm dead there 'll be no two people to get togetherand talk about me . You and Cate know me better than anyone else alive . " This last had been meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chagrin , Lydia had burst into tears . Nell had had to spend the remainder of the telephone conversation bending over backwardthe other way : assuring Lydia , in earnest tones , that yes , she was in the best of health , she had only just last week had her annual checkup ; that she had no intention of dying ; that she fully intended  --  here the humor crept in again , she could n't help it  --  to live into her nineties , till everyone was sick of her , and spend every drop of the money Daddy had left on herself . " Good ! " Lydia had cried passionately . " I hope you do ! " Such emotion , thought Nell , waiting in the line of cars bottleneckedthis side of the tunnel that separated the old business district from the new shopping than . Where had all that emotion come from , suddenly , in Lydia ? Why this passionate , jealous outburst now , when Lydia 's own children were almost grown ? For , when the girls were growing up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , loved , yes , but with the distinct air , on the girls ' part , of toleration . Now both daughters were homing in on her with their frenzied , passionate demands for her attention . What forms did they expect it to take ? Was she to dispense wisdom ? Advice ? Consolation ? Approval ? Admiration ? Was she to compensatethem for not demanding these things from her sooner , all those years ago when she prowled around the house with nothing better to do than give these things , if asked , but knowing quite well , even then , that people never listen until they are ready ? Then , she had had all the time in the world to be in demand , and would have welcomed it if either girl had invited her into the sanctuary of her room and demanded , " Mother ! On the basis of your experience , how should I live my life ? What , in your opinion , is the best way to get along in this world ? Mother , what is the world really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own room , perfectly confidentthat she was plotting the best of lives for herself , deaf to any advice or suggestion that might slow down or mitigate or impede the racy lines of her idealistic young plot . Which was as it should be , thought Nell ; which was . in the nature of things . Now the traffic was inching through the tunnel.  |p327Some  fool , as usual , blew his horn to hear it echo , to disconcert those people who hated being trapped in tunnels . This tunnel was due to be blasted away , any day now ; the city fathers had finallyrelented to progress , over the protest of the nature lovers and the people who owned property on the mountain that was to be blown away . There would , within a year or so , be wide , swift access from the old part of town into the modern new shopping malls springing up in what used to be meadowland , forests , even wilderness , in Nell 's lifetime . In a year or so , everybody would be able to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or thirty miles ( in Nell 's case , it was thirty-two miles , round trip , from Lake Hills to the Meadowland Mall ) without having to wait in a bottleneck at the tunnel . That is , if there was any gas left . This spring , the Iranians had cut off their oil , and already people were saying , " We should have kept our perfectly good stores downtown , with the convenientbus system that only the blacks use now . " Misplaced , thought Nell , who , though no fearer of tunnels , was always glad to emerge into the light . So much in life is misplacedand mistimed , even when people mean well and have the highest aspirations . But that was in the nature of things , too . People , city fathers , countries , had that in common with children : they could not hear until they were ready to listen . So I 'll buy myself a bathing suit and we 'll all three go to the beach , thought Nell , and Lydia will want to be praised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well in her courses and for being invited back by Mary McGregor Turnbull to help her with her program ; and Cate will want her feathers soothed after yet another migration ( though , this time , it really is n't her fault that her college closed ) . I must be careful not to praise Lydia too much , or soothe Cate too much , and ... oh ! speaking of feathers , I was so much looking forward to watching those baby crows learn to fly ! Now I 'm going to miss it , I 'll be gone at just the wrong time . One more misplacement , but how could she help it ? You could n't put a crow family before your own daughters , thoughtp328Nell wryly , circling the rows of the shopping-mall lot for a space near her store ; though she had begun to find a pleasure she had not thought possible in simple solitude . There was a sort of mellowecstasy in just letting yourself go in the sun , contemplating the shifts of light in a day , or the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . When the struggle to " be yourself , " and " hold your own "  --  and hold on to the people you thought you could not lose and still live without was over , you could actually find pleasure in being nobody . Or you could be yourself , but without all that unnecessary pain of assertion , and simply sit and possess all the moments in your life that a certain sunlight or a particular wind reminded you of . So many moments had come back to Nell recently . Lost moments were capable of finding themselves in you if you let " yourself " go . ( " There is a great deal to be said for just being nobody , " Nell heard herself enlightening her grown daughters , against the soft lapping of the tides in Pamlico Sound . There the three of them would sit on the cottage porch , each with a frosted mint julep , rapt with mutual understanding at last . ) Then , getting out of the car , she had to laugh at herself . For , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go and be nobody . If she were to say such a thing , they would glow at her indulgently , each girl preoccupied with her own present needs , and simply not hear what Nell was saying . And here am I , thought Nell , smiling , as she walked toward the ugly brown windowless mall spread like a baffling construction of the future across the landscape she still remembered crowded with crabapple trees in blossom when she and the girls from her boarding school had picnicked here ; here am I , plotting how I can resume the running of their lives  --  as if they were n't old enough to do it for themselves . Some " nobody " I am ! She entered the mall , not really tempted as she passed the first offering at this entrance of the giant trading mart : a BaskinRobbinsice-cream parlor . Then came a pet shop , a jewelry store , and a bookstore  --  one of those big chains . The pet shop was featuringa windowful of Siberian husky puppies , asleep in a deso/late heap as far away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewelry store was crammed with shiny gold and silver " suggestions " for " Your Graduate " ; and the bookstore , from the looks of its window , seemed to have only one book in stock , but lots of that one . She was faintly depressed by the time she entered the vast , open emporium of Blum 's  --  formerly the most exclusive store in town , but which had undergone some qualitative change simply by having been moved from its old quarters to this mall . Everythingin the new Blum 's was open , accessible  --  almost too accessible  --  andplentiful . But why , thought Nell , did that accessibility have to alter the actual feel and smell of the merchandise ? Did we just think a dress was better when we had to ask for what we wanted and some helpful saleslady in black disappeared into a room and came back with that one dress ? No , the quality used to he better , I 'm sure of it . But now she was beginning to sound just like Theodora , who loathed this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the " good " stores had moved out here , and who went on a little too long about " the people you saw out there . " Poor Theodora . That was Nell 's next stop : Memorial Hospital , where Theodora , now out of intensive care , was recuperating from her stroke . Nobody had quite pieced together what had happened . It was Lucy Bell 's opinion that Wickie Lee had actuallystruck Theodora when Theodora had tracked the runaway Wickie Lee and her baby to the old apartment house on Depot Street where Rita and her babies were living on welfare . But Grace Hill , the only one who had actually gone to see Wickie after Theodora 's stroke , testified on Wickie Lee 's behalf : despite the fact that Theodora had barged in on them , had called Wickie lee and her friend Rita " awful names , " all Wickie Lee had done was , well ... maybe told Theodora a few home truths . " It was about time somebody did , " Wickie Lee had told Grace Hill ( who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ findings , via telephone , to the other women , though speaking in a hushed , apologetic tone , as if she half expected the stricken Theodora to rise from her hospital bed , fly through the air , andp330boom over Grace 's terrified shoulder , " Grace Hill , shame ! Am I never going to be able to trust you behind my back ? " ) . " She thinks she can own you , " Wickie Lee had told Grace Hill . " She thinks , just because she helps you out , that you 're her property . Well , nobody 's anybody else 's property . Least of all , I 'm not . And my baby 's not , either . I told her if she came up here again , when nobody invited her , I was going to take one of those sheriff 's warrants out on her . " A sheriff 's warrant against Theodora ! That had been on Sunday morning , a week ago tomorrow . And then , somehow , Theodora had ended up on Azalea 's porch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen Theodora 's old Buick Special parked at the foot of Azalea 's undrivable driveway . Azalea had known something was wrong right then , on account of Miss Blount never took that Buick up Azalea 's hill , even in the worst weather when she brought Azalea ( almost ) home . Theodorasaid it would ruin the Buick 's springs and undercarriage , otherwise she would n't think of making Azalea walk up the hill in bad weather . So Azalea , already knowing something bad had happened , had panted up the last remaining stretch of driveway , which no car could drive ... and found her protectress lying unconscious in a pool of vomit in the hot sun , her arm twisted under her , her face pulled oddly to one side . Azalea had no phone . She dragged the unconscious Theodorainto the shade ( and out of her own vomit ) and ran as fast as her old , swollen legs could carry her , down to the Buick , where she had already seen the keys dangling from the ignition , and  --  regardless of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the nearest source of help , other than the police , which Azalea would never go looking for on her own . She drove to the fire station , just behind the courthouse , and they called the rescue squad . Azalea rode with the rescue squad back to her place , to show them the way . ( Azalea , later waiting in the emergency room , started shakingso bad she had to be given a tranquilizer . She had rrever , it turned out , driven a car before in her life . " I ' us ' turned that keyp331to the right , like I seen Miss Thea do , and put it in ' D , ' and the Lord helped me do the rest , because somebody had to . " ) Theodora was conscious now , but nobody knew yet whether or not she would be completely herself again . Latrobe Bell ( to whom Theodora had given power of attorney after Leonarddied ; and whose son Buddy  --  now that Cate had forfeited her claim  --  was Theodora 's heir ) was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk of an operable aneurysm lodged in an artery in Theodora 's skull . I am glad I have my own daughters , thought Nell ; not that Latrobe wo n't be overscrupulous in all this  --  he 'll know everybodywill be watching  --  but I 'm glad I 've got that little extra padding of blood devotion , in case I fall over unconscious on somebody 's porch . She flipped cursorily through the rack of one-piece size thirty-sixes in the swimwear department before being descended upon by an eager saleslady . But no , this was the " new " Blum 's , where no salesperson ( as they were called now ) seemed at all eager to descend . They kept their distance until you went in search of them . And then , the most frequent reply was " If it 's not there on the rack , we do n't have it . " Nell selected four suits of cut and color appropriate to her build and time of life , and headed for the dressing rooms . A young man stationed at a desk halted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ma'am , I have to check you in . It 's the procedurenow . " " Check me in for what ? " asked Nell . The young man wore skin-tight leather pants and a soft shirt , open down most of the front of his tanned chest . He was attractive , but not in the conventionalmasculine sense . " Oh , you know . " He made some graceful wavy motions with his hands . " People like you have to be inconvenienced becauseothers have sticky fingers . " " Oh ! You mean shoplifters , " said Nell , enlightened . " They 've been robbing us blind , " said the young man dramatically , rolling his eyes up to show the whites . " How many have you got there ? Oh dear , I 'm afraid they only allow three atp332one time . " He fingered the suits , looked up at Nell , cocked his wavy head to one side . " I 'll hold this one for you and solve the problem . You are n't going to want this old thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He relieved Nell of the one suit she really had n't been fond of . " Here , let me see those others . This is going to look stunning , I bet . " He indicated a black , streamlined one , cut lower in the back than the others . " You have such a nice straight back . " Nell , inside her dressing room , tried the young man 's choice on first . They did have an eye . She did have a nice back , smooth-skinned and straight . Some of her contemporaries already had a little hump . I 'm not nineteen , thought Nell , observingher angles in the three-way mirror , but I 'm not disgusting . She looked at herself through the eyes of that young man and saw a solid , taller-than-average woman with grayish-blond hair pulled back from a strong , high-colored face . She had never had to use makeup , other than a little lipstick for fashion 's sake . And to think , mused Nell , trying on her second-favorite suit , these very looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain . For , when she was young , she had thought she looked like a cross between a peasant and a Valkyrie : she had yearned for small bones and delicacy and elusive feminine airs . The other bathing suits seemed dowdy , after the sleek black one . It had turned this whole outing into an unexpected pleasure . Nell decided to buy two , so she would always have one dry . She looked forward to telling the young man , but when she returned to the desk , he had been replaced by an older woman . She emerged into the bright sun of the parking lot with her two look-alike suits folded in tissue and nestled in a shiny green-and-white-striped carrier bag that had BLUM 'S IS MY BAG printed in big black letters across both sides . In the old days , the Blum bags had been a simple green , with " Blum 's " scrawled discreetlyin one corner . One knew simply from the color of the green that the bag was from Blum 's . But I do n't want to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembering when this parking lot was grass underfoot and crowded with crabapple trees in blossom where her girls '  |p333school  had come to picnic in the spring . There , or about there , where that small Mercedes was parked , she and her friends had spread their blanket and begun to unload their basket of schoolpackedsandwiches . She was happier today , a sixty-three-yearoldwidow standing on the hot asphalt under the noonday sun , than she had been as a fifteen-year-old girl . Then , she had been desolate most of the time . She was too big and clumsy and her sentences always sounded too . . . exact . She had no music in her gait or her voice , like some of the girls she admired . No , thought Nell , the " old days " had their charms , but they had their sorrows , too . These are the new days , and my back is still straight . Why , come to think of it , I 'm living in what those young girls shaded under that long-ago crabapple tree would call " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into the future ! Where are they all now ? she wondered , setting off for the hospital to see Theodora . Prissy and Lynne-Anne and Merle and Sophie ? A pity I did n't keep up with them . But I was so eager to get out of that school . I could n't wait to say good-bye to them and disappear into this strange mountain town , where my mother had died , where not a soul knew me outside the school . I wanted to become a nurse and forget . Forget what ? Why did those girls cause me such pain ? They meant well , they wanted to be my friend more than I wanted to be theirs . I held back . It hurt too much . It hurt that Prissy had that wonderful father who worked for the Department of the Interior and was always comingand fetching her to take her away on camping trips , when my father did n't even want me to come home and live with him after Mother died here in the sanatorium . It hurt that Lynne-Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dainty Merle , could attractany man from the eighty-year-old school gardener to someone'sthree-year-old brother ; and that Sophie had such scads of money she could bring her own horse from El Paso , in his own private train car , and board him near the school . They thought I was standoffish . I remember once Merle cuddled up to me and accused , " Nell , why wo n't you really love us ? " They were attracted to me because of my aloofness . But it was n't aloofness , it was just plain jealousy . I was so jealous it hurt . And what goodp334did my jealousy do anybody ? Oh , silly , silly self , with all its wasteful assertiveness . What pain I would have saved myself if I could just have gone on and shared what they wanted to share with me . We all had our points . We were all aspects of . . . of that season 's girl . It takes a variety of flowers to make a garden . But who can think of oneself as an aspect  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of fifteen ? I wonder how many of them have made it into the future . Who still has a straight back , who still has her husband alive , what wisdom do they think they 've gained ? I hope they all are still alive . And well ? Not , like poor Theodora , looking at the walls of some hospital room and wondering , Where am I ? She met Buddy Bell and his wife , just leaving the hospital elevator . Nell exchanged with Buddy the overenthusiastic greetingsof people who have never really cared for each other , meanwhileracking her brain for the name of Buddy 's wife : for Nell had nothing against the young woman ( Sue ? Sally ? Jo-Anne ? .. . years ago she had been in Nell 's Girl Scout Troop . . . she was the same age as Lydia ) . Buddy announced with a proprietary air that , though there had not been a great deal of change in his godmother 's condition , Theodora was " holding her own . " " Daddy 's up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour , you may just catch him . Nell , you remember Janet , do n't you ? " " Of course I do , " said Nell , shaking the young Mrs. Bell 's hand . " Janet was in my Scout Troop . " " Way back in the Dark Ages , " replied Janet , with the easy self-deprecation such girls relied on as a staple of social exchange . Only , poor Janet had not quite mastered the knack : Nell noted the fleeting dismay that darkened Janet 's smooth forehead as soon as the words were out of her mouth  --  would Mrs. Strickland think the " Dark Ages " referred to her ? Nell helped her out . " You and my younger daughter , Lydia , were in at the same time . " " Oh Lydia ! " breathed the grateful Janet , on sure footing again . " How is Lydia ? I always admired her so much ! "  | " Oh , she 's fine , " said Nell , " she 's gone back to school now that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had once said about girls like Janet . " There are ' middle-of-thelist ' girls , " Lydia had declared , with the assurance of one who knew herself to be at the top of the list , " and , no matter what they do , or how hard they try , you just never think of them first . " " And what 's old Cate up to , these days , " interjected Buddy Bell , in a tone just a shade too familiar for Nell 's liking . The tone invited her to collude with him in condemnation of " old Cate , " who was always " up to " something ... the kinds of things that caused her to lose out on the spoils of godchildship . When Buddy Bell was fourteen years of age , he and some rowdies had gone on a Halloween rampage , ringing people 's doorbells and then throwing unwelcome things on these people 's porches , while the boys waited in nearby bushes to observe with much hilarityhow the homeowner dealt with burning brown-paper bags full of garbage ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same instinct for " stepping up the experimental odds " that would later make him a valued member of missile-research teams , got the bright idea of leaving a lighted firecracker on a man 's porch . What would the man do ? The man answered the doorbell , took one look at the destructive sizzling thing , attempted to throw it clear of his porch , and lost all the fingers on his right hand . Oh , what woes and wails ensued from the Bell family ! Lucy Bell was in tears or on the verge of them whenever she showed herself in public for weeks after . Latrobe , gravefacedas a preacher , spoke about the " misdirected energies of youth . " A repentant Buddy was briefly exhibited , before being sent down to Atlanta to finish the school year from the house of his older brother , married and working for the IRS ( the same brother whose conception had altered Theodora 's life ) . An outof-courtsettlement was negotiated by one of the " flashier " lawyersin town , and a year later Buddy Bell was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was all as before ; only , there were four fingers fewer in the world . Now Buddy stood before her , thick-necked , middle-aged ,
