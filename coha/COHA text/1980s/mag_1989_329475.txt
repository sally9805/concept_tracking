After a two- month investigation by the Florida game and freshwater fish commission , the state attorney 's office and the Federal Government have filed suit against the company and five employees for alleged cruelty to animals . Among the charges : firing rifles at hawks , beating vultures to death with sticks , and disturbing the nests and eggs of egrets . <P> In an apparent attempt to control the bird population , Disney had asked for a license to relocate protected wildlife away from the theme park , where they annoyed tourists and destroyed property . But for some of the island 's vultures , in particular , relocation became extermination .
