Tough new restrictions on political asylum <P> Blessed with a thriving economy and one of the world 's most generous political-asylum laws , West Germany has long been a mecca for refugees . That traditional open-door attitude toward political exiles is now being severely tested . Officials estimate that more than 150,000 foreigners will seek asylum in West Germany this year , compared with fewer than 3,000 a decade ago . Most of the immigrants , it appears , come in search of jobs rather than sanctuary , and nine out of every ten refugees requesting asylum will eventually be turned down . But under West Germany 's cumbersome judicial procedures , it can take up to eight years to process applications and appeals . Meanwhile , the asylum seekers are free to stay in the country , living on welfare payments that this year will cost federal and local governments up to $500 million . <P> The new wave of immigrants come from Turkey , Pakistan , Ethiopia , Afghanistan and a dozen other impoverished Third World nations . After entering West Germany as visitors , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted after World War II as a deliberate antidote to the racist , exclusionary laws of the Nazi era . Article 16 of the constitution guarantees the right of asylum to those persecuted on political grounds and Article 19 assures the right to appeal any denial of asylum . <P> With welfare costs soaring , West Germans are getting fed up with the immigrants ' abuse of their country 's hospitality . A number of cities-including Frankfurt and Essen-with large populations of foreign Gastarbeiter ( guest workers ) and recent immigrants have declared themselves closed to any more asylum seekers . Reason : they feel they are bearing a disproportionate share of the economic burden . <P> Earlier this month more than 200 Afghans and Ethiopians were stranded for five days at Frankfurt airport ; Mayor Walter Wallmann refused to accept them on the grounds that his city had already absorbed 8,000 asylum seekers this year , at a cost of $12 million . Eventually , the refugees were given temporary shelter at an already overcrowded camp for asylum seekers in Bavaria-the only one of its kind in West Germany . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bavaria , has warned : " We can not continue to push these poor people around . " <P> Strauss and his fellow Bavarians have been pressing Bonn to build more of these camps to handle the immigrants as they arrive . The camps , built at federal expense , would reduce the financial strain on local governments . Last week the Bundesrat ( upper house of parliament ) instead moved to slow the increasingly burdensome influx of foreigners by passing a tough new set of regulations on asylum applications . Asylum seekers will not be eligible for work permits during their first year in West Germany , nor will family-support payments be made unless asylum has been confirmed . Judicial procedures will be streamlined , so that applications can be processed within two years . Says a Bonn immigration official : " Our aim is to stop abuse of our asylum laws , and in no way block bona fide political refugees . We hope it will help .
