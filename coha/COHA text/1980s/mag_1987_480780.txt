Landscape does not exist without an observer , without a human presence . The land exists , but the " scape " is a projection of human consciousness , an image received . It is a frame we put around a single view and the ways in which we see and describe this spectacle represent our " frame of mind , " what we know and what we seek to know . One of the reigning notions of our culture is that the land is our adversary , that nature is a dirty thing ( think of the double meaning of the word " soil " ) and that God put human beings here to dominate it , to make Edenic gardens out of the wasteland . We are the **25;4117;TOOLONG of Cortes , the children of Emerson . But did the idea of landscape-as-garden arise from a fear of nature or from a love of wild things ? Either way , in the wrong hands this " civilizing " process in effect blinded us . It reduced the wildness , diversity , and transience of nature to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a weed ; this is sublime and this is ugly . As conquerors and as gardeners we came to a landscape with serious intentions : not simply to know , but to change ; not just to visit , but to possess . Much that was done was good , much was bad . We presumed too much . We imposed on what we found ; we could not cherish without embellishing or altering what was simply there . I live on a ranch in Wyoming . We raise beef cattle and crops of grain and hay , but all around us is wildness . At night the mountain lions come down from their rock caves and kill fawns . Black bears emerge from their dens hungry . We see their tracks overprinted by the cubs ' smaller ones , coming and going from den to creek , den to winterkills . In June the elk bring their calves to a sage-covered bench to play . Directly below are our hayfields . Where our fences stop , their game trails begin . The native grasses we irrigate are for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at best , they blend . Our ranch is an " end-of-the-road place , " isolated by the 10,000-foot mountains that rise behind us . If I rode a horse north , I would not reach a fence or a town for three days . In the other direction there is no one view ? it is all view , a hundred miles in three directions . The mountains behind us rose seventy million years ago . They 're young and steep and still rising . The shallow seas that had covered Wyoming receded , leaving a colorful carpet of mudstones and sandstones : red , orange , green , gray , and white . The mountains rose and the basins fell , and the commotion of upthrusts , faults , and folds resulted in sheer rock faces of limestone , granite , and dolomite . Dinosaurs came and went . On our lower meadow , a quarry worked by the American Museum of Natural History offered up twenty-five complete skeletons . The fossil record of the area is replete with early organisms : hundred-million-year-old sponges as well as the remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some landscapes are surface ? what we see out our back doors ? while others start farther down in the earth . On the other hand , a Wyoming landscape can be almost all sky . I try to catalogue the names for all the blues ? Prussian , French , and Italian ; indigo , periwinkle , powder , beryl , and cobalt ; robin 's egg , peacock , and eggshell ; lapis and azure ? and still there are n't enough words to describe the aerial landscape above . 24 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE / SEPTEMBER One day the landscape was a screen of bugs . A hatch of mayflies blackened the air , then vanished , replaced by bumblebees catapulting from currant bush to thistle . The screen of bugs became a front moving in . Tattered black clouds headed for me . All across the state the wind carried tree branches , dust from plowed fields , debris of all sorts , and transient winged seeds . When the storm centered over the ranch , the wind stopped . The clouds picked themselves apart and fell to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sagebrush . It carried the landscape away , or rather , the landscape became mist only , a blindness that was not black but blank . Then the ceiling rose as quickly as it had come down and slid against the granite face of the mountain behind me , rising and dropping as if taking part in the old geological tumult of landforms . That night the clouds returned with rain . Branched lightning gave the landscape a ghostly hue : the greens , blues , and browns looked tar-nished . Somehow the colors were all wrong and the landscape appeared false . But it was just an-other version of the same , changing 1,1-1 thing . Ihe ways in which we come to know a landscape are preliterate . " A sense of place " implies a sensory knowledge . It mounts up in our minds : empires of smells and sounds , textures andsights held fast by memory , flooding back again and again in such urgent , pungent ways as to let us reenter those places . A river slits its neck for us ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throats as song ; in the mountain fastness of granite cracks , a pine tree grows ; and we humans dive backward and forward in time , beginning seventy million years ago , when the Mountains came into being . We rise with the landforms . We feel the upper altitudes of thin air , sharp stings of snow and ultraviolet on our flesh . I have lived on Wyoming ranches for eleven years but was born in the Mediterranean climate of a coastal California town . No matter where we live as adults , the landscape or cityscape in which we grew up stains us with its indelible ink , as if the umbilical cord by which we were tethered to life carried not only nutrient liquids , but also minerals , seawater , soil , and sun . The first earthquake l experienced shook my sister out of bed . I grabbed my parakeet , Willy , ran outside , and lay down . To feel the ground move in this way was to learn what " ground " means in all senses of the word : ground as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is knowable ? according to Webster 's , " the surface which limits the downward extent of something . " Other California disasters taught me how to see . During one raging brushfire in which my sister and I had to move a herd of horses to the beach for safety , I saw a whole lemon grove go up in flames , and forever after I 've thought of lemons as orbs of fire , and recalled the smell of fire as sour . There were quiet nights too ? so quiet we could hear the seals barking on the Channel islands . Their cries bounced against the mountains directly hehind us and fell down on the roof of my head , poured into my ears so that when I woke I thought I was a seal floating . To see ? that is , to discover ? is not an act of interpretation , of transfixing with preconceived ideas what is before us ; rather , it is an act of surrender . The writer and naturalist Barry Lopez talks about bowing to the earth . Too often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture of respect , of dignity , of mutuality . If the earth could stand up and bow back , perhaps it would . Maybe that is what an earthquake is all about . Sometimes when I am walking or riding in heavy weather I imagine that it is leaving stains on me , and that if I were able to see the inside of my skin , I would see its marks : snow , rain , hail , frostbite , sun . Surrendering means stripping down , taking away every veil , every obstacle between ourselves and the earth . It means losing ourselves in the otherness of a place , delighting in its strangeness . To bend down and kiss a rock , as poet William Butler Yeats claimed to have done , is to seek equality , not dominance ; it is to open ourselves to every small and ordinary thing for the larger purpose of knowing its truth . It is to become drenched , to be , in the words of Henry James , one on whom nothing is lost " ; it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within , to let a place leave its watermark on us . If we go out in order to find , not to impose , the landscape touches us and we it . Only then is a sense of place born .
