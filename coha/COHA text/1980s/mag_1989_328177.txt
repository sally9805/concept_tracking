&lt; <P> In the closing days of his 1987 electoral campaign , South Korean President Roh Tae Woo made a surprising pledge . If he won the country 's first free elections in nearly two decades , the handpicked successor to ex-General Chun Doo Hwan promised to submit his administration to an interim vote of confidence  --  giving wary voters , in essence , a chance to change their mind . But last week , citing the danger of " social chaos , " Roh broke his campaign promise and indefinitely postponed the long-awaited referendum . <P> Roh also ordered a sharp crackdown on dissidents , arming police divisions with M-16 rifles and abandoning a policy that prohibited firing on protesters . The move sparked violent demonstrations in six cities . Ironically , Roh 's original decision to cancel the referendum had won widespread support , including that of opposition leaders , who feared a positive vote would damage their own chances in the elections scheduled for 1992.
