Four of John Trumbull 's paintings of the American Revolution hang in the rotunda of the Capitol in Washington , but to see the complete series you have to visit the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven , Conn . What they say about the war and the country is still worth pondering . <P> Yale 's Trumbulls hang on a wall the color of tomato soup in front of a green plush banquette meant to duplicate an overripe art gallery of the past century . It is best to study the paintings in the order of the events they depict . The first two are pictures of battles : the failed defense of Bunker 's Hill ( actually Breed 's Hill ) , which Trumbull had seen with his own eyes , and a failed attack on Quebec . The central event in each is a military pieta , the death on the field of an American general , though the compositions are swirls of confusion and activity . Hands wave , lifeless limbs sprawl , flags stream or tangle crazily against smoky , lowering skies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Declaration of Independence , is probably the most familiar ( it is reproduced , badly , on the reverse of the $2 bill ) . But it is not a terribly good painting . Trumbull shows the drafting committee presenting its handiwork to John Hancock , but he was also obliged to include 40-odd additional Founding Fathers . As a result , the eye wanders from John Adams ' stockings to Thomas Jefferson 's red waistcoat to the drum hanging oddly on the room 's rear wall . <P> With The Capture of the Hessians at Trenton , there is a change . Once again , we see dead and dying on the field , but this is an after-the-battle scene , and there is no doubt about the center of attention : the American general who accepts the wounded Hessian commander 's surrender , George Washington . The cloud behind Washington 's head , lest we miss the point , is white . Washington dominates all but one of the remaining scenes in the set , which ends with his resignation as Commander in Chief . He wins the battles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Yale has quite sensibly grouped the pictures around another , larger canvas , not strictly in the series , but proclaiming the same message : a standing portrait of Washington at the Battle of Trenton , in a bright yellow uniform and navy blue frock coat . Behind him , a horse rears and a cannon lies shattered . But he radiates a majestic calm . An empire , one feels , might well break on that forehead , or a republic arise . <P> Trumbull 's notion of Washington 's character was not unique ; virtually all his contemporaries acknowledged his poise , his integrity , his resolve , his reserve . Nor was Trumbull alone in his estimate of the importance of Washington 's character to the success of the Revolution and the new nation . Washington had a quasi-divine status in his lifetime , and the Washington Monument was the first of the great presidential memorials to rise in the city named after him . <P> Yet in the past 40 years or so , his reputation has sunk . He may be on our quarters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the testimony of our intelligentsia is to be believed . Arthur Schlesinger Sr. 's poll of prominent American historians in 1948 put Washington second , after Abraham Lincoln . In 1981 a poll of all Ph.D. - holding American historians at the assistant- professor level or higher found that Washington had sunk to third , behind Franklin D. Roosevelt . What happened ?
