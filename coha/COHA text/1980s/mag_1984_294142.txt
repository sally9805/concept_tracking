Debating Kissinger 's proposals <P> Anyone who proposes radically revamping a 35-year-old institution can expect to stir controversy , and that was exactly what Henry Kissinger did last week . In an article written for TIME , the former Secretary of State called for a thorough reshaping of the 16-member Atlantic Alliance to give the West Europeans more responsibility for their own defense . <P> He suggested a reversal of the tradition that the alliance 's military commander is always an American and its civilian leader a European ; he asked Europe to play a greater role in making decisions on arms control and ground defense . If the Europeans do not accept this responsibility , Kissinger wrote , the U.S. should withdraw up to half its 222,000 ground forces from the Continent . <P> The quickest response came from West Germany . Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Alois Mertes , who is close to Chancellor Helmut Kohl , rejected Kissinger 's proposals , saying that " Europe can not take on more responsibility than its power permits . " NATO 's military chief , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a crisis he would carry much greater weight with the U.S. President than any European . " A U.S. commander , Mertes added , " strengthens the credibility of the alliance in Moscow as well . " <P> In Washington , State Department Spokesman John Hughes agreed with Kissinger about " the centrality of the transatlantic defense relationship to Western security and world peace . " But he went on to say that the alliance was healthy , its structure sound and its strategy " valid and viable . " Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Richard Burt argued that NATO had met one of its most severe tests by beginning to deploy new missiles in Europe . Said he : " The performance over the past 18 months has demonstrated to anyone paying attention that the alliance is sound . " <P> The British government declared that Kissinger 's proposals were being " carefully considered , " but privately officials said that he had " seriously underestimated the extent of the European military contribution to the alliance . " The Continent , they argued , supplies approximately 90% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A halving of U.S. troops would be a disaster , they said , because it would cast doubt on U.S. readiness to defend Europe . <P> In France , Pierre Hassner of the National Foundation of Political Science disputed the practicality and timing of Kissinger 's proposals , but he agreed that the problems posed are real . " Europeans have to take greater charge of their own defense , " he said , " but that can come only gradually . " Cesare Merlini , head of Italy 's Institute for Foreign Affairs , welcomed the debate . Said he : " I do n't like Kissinger 's diagnosis , but I like the therapy . "
