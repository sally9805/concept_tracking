THE TALK .

While I was opening the mail in my study the other morning , a freak of sunlight directed my eye along the blade of my letter opener to a tiny patch of printing there . I took a closer look . The tiny print said " japan . " I went on and finished with my bills and appeals and credit-card solicitations , but something had stirred in my mind . I took off my glasses and gave them a close inspection . They , too , had a patch of tiny printing -- on one of the earpieces . It said " France .

The car keys ( though they might not have been ) were U.S.A. , but the whistle and the pedometer were both marked " Germany . " In the table drawer were a. chain dog leash from Germany , a dog comb from Japan , and a flashlight from Hong Kong . This was getting interesting . I decided on a house search .

My wife 's sewing machine is a Singer ( U.S.A. ) , but its accompanying packet of assorted needles was marked " Made in Red-ditch , England . " I went hack downstairs . I passed through the Irving room ( I was n't interested in furniture and lamps and rugs and hooks and draperies and such ) and on through the dining room ( I was n't interested in china and silver and such , either ) .

I knew there was more to be found . In the toolshed , for instance  --  the saw I use to cut up firewood is from Sweden , the wedge I use to split it for the fireplace is from Finland , the pruning shears are from England . But after an apple corer ( that epitome of nineteenth-century Yankee ingenuity ) from Germany , after a galvanized pail from industrialized Mexico , after a whisk broom from behind the Iron Curtain , I decided not to go on . Sold IT seems that when the publisher Nelson Doubleday and some associates were deciding recently to buy the New York Mets baseball franchise for twenty-one point one million dollars , nobody bothered to consult Tim McGinnis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . McGinnis is right there in the Doubleday &; Company headquarters , on Park Avenue , where he 's an assistant editor in the Anchor Press division . He is also the captain of the Doubleday softball team . List summer , under McGinnis 's stewardship , the Doubleday entry in the Publishers ' Softball League , which consists of eighty teams , won eight games and lost only one during the regular season . The team won twice more during the post-season playoffs , before losing the championship game to the Charter Publishing Company , whose team , according to McGinnis , " got lucky . " In 1978 , Doubleday 's first season in the league , its team also made the playoffs . The New York Mets , on the other hand , have had a solid grip on last place in the National League East since the twilight of the Abraham Beame administration . We went to visit McGinnis the other day in his office , where he occupies himself with line-by -- line editing of nonfiction tides like " Children 's Secrets , " " Mary Frampton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A Consumer 's Guide to Cosmetics . " He is well built and neatly bearded , prematurely graying in his mid-twenties . When it comes to softball , he understands the verities and vagaries of the game as it is played in the Sheep Meadow in Central Park . He knows , for instance , that while in theory there is no substitute for fundamentals solid hitting , expert fielding , and flawless execudon  --  you take what you can get ; that it 's not a good idea to let any of the first-stringers drink more than two beers during a game unless the score is really lopsided ; that when things get a little crowded in the Sheep Meadow , and the right fielder from an adjacent game happens to be standing between your pitcher and your second baseman , you play around the obstacle ; and that you play to win . With convincing sincerity , McGinnis says that he does n't mind hailing a taxi to Central Park while toting the team 's equipment in a duffelbag . He also claims that it does n't bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season about fifty Doubleday employees show up in Central Park pretending that they want to play but really wanting only to claim a free T-shirt . Culling a starting lineup from this horde might bear an unwelcome resemblance to casting " El Cid , " but McGinnis knows that you have to go with your established talent . On the whole , he seems like an even-tempered field general in the Bob Lemon tradition . The manner in which he learned that Doubleday &; Company had bought the llvlets upset hint only slightly . " It was a memorandum , " he told us . " It was sitting on my desk - when I got to work the other day , and it said , Nelson Doubleday is pleased to announce that Doubleday &; Company has acquired the major controlling interest in the New York Mets baseball team . ' just like that . Most of the memos around here are about personnel changes and thermostat settings . This one was peculiarly understated . All this is so new that I think a lot of us still regard the Mets as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that we 're unsure how this affects our future in the Publishers ' Softball League . " Last summer , I took over as captain after Mike Casey , who worked in photocopying , and who ran the team , left the company in midseason . It was unusual for someone to do that . The unwritten rule is : Even if you get another job offer in April , you stick around until September for the sake of the team . Actually , though , it seems that every time we lose a good player we get two to replace him or her . We 're a dynasty ball club . We play six men and four women at a time . That 's a league rule  --  at least four women in the lineup . Who are our top women ? Well , there 's Party Henderson , at second base . No relation of Steve Henderson , the Met outfielder . She batted about .360 last year , and I think he batted only .306 . Then , there 's Linda Dugan , who pitches and plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , you look at a guy like Lee Mazzilli , who 's playing first base now for the Mets , and who hit .303 last season , and then you consider that we have four players who , although we do n't have to face National League pitching , batted over .700 . It makes you wonder . Ralph Mendoza , our first baseman , who works in the foreign-sales division , had a batting average of over .500 . Basically , whenever he came to the plate and failed , to get a hit , it was a shock to all concerned . But do n't get me wrong . I 'm not saying that we 're better than the Mets . In fact , I think if it ever comes to our going up against them head to head , we 'd prefer to play the Mets and their wives . " We asked McGinnis whether he anticipates major changes in the Doubleday &; Company office routine . " I ca n't say for sure , " he said . " Maybe from now on , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and popcorn poppers  --  they 'll give us baseball gloves and batting helmets . Who knowsP Maybe they should start having Book Days at Shea Stadium  --  you know , every child under the age of twelve who comes out to the ballpark gets a free novel . Let me think about this . What do you suppose Met fans read ? Probably something in the self-help area . Maybe ' Your Erroneous Zones , ' by Dr. Wayne W. Dyer . No , that 's not a Doubleday book . We 'll figure something out . Pretty soon , you 'll probably see ' The Joe Torre Story ' on the Doubleday list . " The telephone rang , and McGinnis excused himself to answer it . When he hung up , he said , " One more thing . Anyone who gets cut from the Mets is welcome to a free tryout with the Doubleday softball team . I mean that . And , to reciprocate , some of our better players might like a shot at the major leagues  --  you know , a chance to try out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case I think free trips to spring training , down in St. Petersburg , would he in order . At one point , I thought I personally might like to do some i-adin and television announcing for the Mets , but then I realized that I like the Met announcers the way they are , They 're minimalists  --  although that may be because lately there has n't been much to say . Finally , I would n't mind it a bit if the company changed the letterhead on its stationery  --  put the Mister Met mascot next to the Doubleday anchor . Mister Met is a cute little guy , with a baseball for a head and a big smile , and I think he 'd look great perched right up there where it says ' Doubleday : A Communications Corporation . ' " Fame Tom . ' N. LA CORTE has announced that it is his ambition " to put Brook-lyn on the map . " He issued this mani-festo while delivering some stirring remarks the other day during the Brooklyn Hall of Fame luncheon , at the Fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment seems ripe and Mr. LaCorte can find an opening in his schedule , he organizes a Hall of Fame induction ceremony . The most recent previous induction took place in 1973 . This fact might lead some people to regard the Fort Hamilton affair as a revival of the Hall of Fame , but Mr. La-Corte would disagree . As far as he is concerned , the Hall of Fame is right where it has always been  --  in the drawer of a file cabinet on the ground floor of his brownstone , in Brooklyn Heights . He would feel overwhelmed with pride if the Hall of Fame were someday to occupy a more visible and more monumental site . Finding the ideal spot , however , requires a lot of work and effort  --  his energy . The Brooklyn Hall of Fame must share office space with the Italian Historical Society of America , the Genealogical and Heraldic Institute of America , the A Better 1Vorld Begins with Me Institute , and several file drawers brimming with evidence of the achievement-studded quality of Mr. LaCorte 's life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is also some actuarial paraphernalia on the premises . When John LaCorte seizes an idea , he does n't like to loosen his grasp until he has worked it over thoroughly . It pains him to think that some people out there remain unfamiliar with the deeds of Giovanni da Verrazano , Antonio Meucci , and Charles J. Bonaparte . For many years , he has labored vigorously to usher these three men into the limelight . Unprompted , Mr. LaCorte will recite the details of his public-relations efforts in behalf of Verrazano , the Florentine explorer who sailed into lower New York Bay in 1524 , eighty-five years before Hen ry Hudson discovered the upper West Side . Without Mr. LaCorte 's urging , it would not have occurred to anyone to name the suspension bridge between Staten Island and Brooklyn inVerrazano 's honor . Mr. LaCorte has had somewhat less success promoting the causes of Meucci , " the true inventor of the telephone " ( 1871 , versus Alexander Graham Bell 's 1876 ) , and Bonaparte , who was a grandnephew of Napoleon I , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the F.B.I. , in 1908 . At irregular intervals , Mr. La-Corte publishes the I talian-Z merican Review , which he also writes and edits . Each issue contains extensive front-line dispatches from the pro-Verrazano , pro-Meucci , and pro-Bonaparte campaigns . At the luncheon in Bay Ridge , two banners hung from curtains behind the head table . They said " Welcome to the Brooklyn Hall of Fame " and " A Better World Begins with Brooklyn , Better B'klyn Comm . " To economize , Mr. LaCorte had decided to use the Hall of Fame gathering as an occasion to make a plug for the A Better World Begins with Me Institute . He also mentioned that he regarded it as celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of the opening of the Verrazano Bridge , although no banner proclaimed this . The objective of the A Better World Begins with Me Institute , which Mr. LaCorte founded last March , is a better world . Attaining this objective is a sizable chore  --  one that the founder believes should be organized at the grass roots . Therefore , the institute 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooklyn , U.S.A. " Cleaning up the present global mess and putting Brooklyn on the map go hand in hand . If everything proceeds smoothly , the job will take about twenty years : until the year 2000 , at which point Mr. LaCorte will be ninety . If in the meantime he buys a white linen suit and allows his trim goatee to become shaggy , he will be able to greet the next millennium looking even more like Colonel Sanders than he already does . Mr. LaCorte , whose voice does not require electronic amplification but who used a microphone anyway , made several brief speeches . During his main address , he said that " mankind is a very beautiful thing " and that the hundred and fifty-nine people who had gathered at Fort Hamilton  --  they included honorees , politicians , educators , and clerics  --  were particularly beautiful . Thirteen of the guests were college students  --  the new Brooklyn Hall of Fame College Student Award recipients . Their names were Patricia Moe-Ca , jack Dobson , Brian Flynn , Sharon Frommer , Thelma Gormezano , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne O'Callaghan , Armand M. Patella , Jr. , Maxine Rozzi , Edward Strafaci , and Raymond . J. Trentacost . Each student received a certificate and posed for a photograph with John LaCorte ; until he came along , none of them had been really famous . There was one other honoree  --  Emanuel Celler , the former congressman , who served almost fifty years in the House of Representatives . Mr. Celler , who is now ninety-one years old , received a plaque from Murray Stein , the postmaster of Brooklyn , and then offered some extemporaneous remarks in the man-shall-prevail vein . After the luncheon broke up , Mr. LaCorte seemed preoccupied  --  he might have been thinking ahead to the ninth annual Meucci luncheon , which was scheduled for two days later , at Gargiulo 's , in Coney Island hut- we managed to talk with him long enough to learn that he has high hopes for the future of the Brooklyn Hall of Fame . " We find it difficult to select people for this distinction , because we insist that an individual must have contributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You see , sometimes people want to be honored but they do n't want to do the work . But I have hope . If possible , sometime during 1980 we will inaugurate the Staten Island Hall of Fame . If Staten Island gets good roots , then next year we will go to Queens . And if that hug catches we will go on to the Bronx . But do n't commit me to Manhattan . I ca n't say for sure about that . That is a difficult question . There is some uncertainty about Manhattan . Manhattan is different . " Birgit Nilsson 's Return HEN Birgit Nilsson ended her performance in Strauss 's " Elek-tra " last Friday with a triumphant vic-tory dance and a flood of incandescent sound , the Metropolitan Opera audi-ence rose to its feet and responded with the kind of visceral roar that only a singer of extraordinary qualities can inspire . The occasion was Miss Nils-son 's first American operatic perform-ance in five years ( her absence was due to a tax dispute with the United States government ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most singers are sliding gently into re-tirement Nilsson still has her formida-ble vocal equipment in topnotch work-ing order . Hoch-dramiltische sopranos , whose silvery , trumpetlike voices can ride over the heavy orchestration of a Wagner , a Strauss , or , in some cases , a Puccini opera , have always been as rare as snow leopards , and it is generally agreed that Miss Nilsson , a practical , earthy Swede with a voice of uncommon size , thrust , and hrilliance , is the champion in the field . Her return as Elekrra , which , because of its length , intensity , and stratospheric tessitura , is a killer of a role , provided a rigorous test of the operatic form that she has been displaying for almost thirty-five years . Moreover , because Miss Nilsson has appeared in a dozen other productions of " Elektra " since the Met staged its version for her , in 1966 , simply remembering the staging was a considerable feat . We observed her in action a week before the premiire and can report that she is a cheerful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first rehearsal we attended was a sitzprobe for orchestra and singers which took place in a large basement studio at the Met . As Miss Nilsson  --  a short , trim , handsome woman with Hack hair , who was wearing black slacks , a black pullover , and a brown suede jacket  --  took a seat with the other singers on a wooden platform at the back of the room , James Levine , the Met 's conductor , mounted the podium at the front and gave the orchestra some musical instructions . " Folks , the key word here is contrast , " he said . " Let the really roof-raising moments happen . Then , where it goes from forte to piano , I want you to disappear immediately hack to nothing . That way , we get a transparent texture ; the singers conic through , the text comes through , and the little details in the orchestration are alive and present even when they 're soft . Secondly , we need a greater variety in tempo . Watch carefully for the little ruhatos , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that it 's not a monotonous , metronomic pulse . " Mr. Levine gave a sweeping downbeat to bring in the monolithic chords that begin the opera , and , after a short introductory scene involving the palace servants , Miss Nilsson leaned forward in her chair and began the great invocation to the dead Agamemnon . As her enormous voice rang through the room , Mr. Levine adjusted his instrumental balances , taking the orchestra ( one of the largest in opera ) from brassy thundering climaxes down to soft , intimate lyrical passages , in which the individual instruments were clearly THE NEW YORKER audible . The rehearsal proceeded with very few stops . Miss Nilsson , who had obviously established a close rapport with Mr. Levine , followed him carefully . The orchestra , caught up in the Nilsson spell , played half an hour beyond the allotted rehearsal time and , at the end , looked slightly stunned . Mr. Levine hugged Miss Nilsson and said , " Birgit , that was absolutely phenomenal . " " Where have you been all my life ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I was sixteen , I thought Elektra ' was the greatest thing that had ever happened , " said Mr. Levine . " Now here I am conducting it for the first time at thirty-six . " As Mr. Levine dashed off down the hall , Miss Nilsson explained to us that this " Elektra " was the first opera they had collaborated on . " I 've had so many bad experiences with conductors that I only work now with people I feel comfortable with , " she said . " If you sing with a conductor who drags , who does n't feel the pulse of the music , it destroys you . Halfway through the evening , you begin to feel that there is no way out . But Jimmy has such a feeling for voices that he really tries to help the singers . He breathes with us , lie reads our intentions , he does n't overwhelm us , and he 's there when we need him . You know , there are two famous Strauss quotes about this opera . One time , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can still hear the singers . ' Another rime , he said , ' I want " Elektra " to be played like Mendelssohn . ' " We asked Miss Nilsson why the role of Elektra was so famously difficult . " It 's very high and very low , " she said . " But I do n't feel that it 's as difficult as people think . With a good conductor , you do n't have to shout fortissimo from beginning to end . There are lots of beautiful phrases that you can sing piano . But it 's a very hard role physically , because there 's no intermission to let you regain your strength . You are onstage fur an hour and three-quarters , and since you must be very intense and always on the edge of everything , this takes a lot out of you . The only times to rest are the few moments when Elektra burrows down between the rocks , looking for the axe she wants to use to kill her mother , Klytemnestra . The stage manager puts some ginger ale there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time I 'm so nervous that I knock the glass ove Y. " Is the victory song at the end the hardest thing in the score ? " we asked . " Not for me , " replied Miss Nilsson. " / worry more about the - fight that Elektra has with her mother in the middle of the opera . The vocal line there is very high  --  it lies around G and A  --  and the exposed high C that comes near the end is never easy . So when you finish you are worn out by the intensity of the acting and you 're very dry in the throat . If you get past that scene , you can sing much more lyrically , more musically , with Orest . I always say to myself after the C , ' Now my screaming part is over . I will try and pull myself together and finish the opera . ' That 's also the point where you know if you have been overdoing things . If you give too much voice at the beginning of Elektra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the quiet scenes . Of course , you can not go out onstage and sing with a computer in your head that says ' Save your voice . ' You have to do these things by instinct . For the music that comes after the deaths of Klytenmestra and Aegisth , you give a lot again , but there it 's O.K. , because you know it 's the end . " The next morning , we returned to the Met and found Miss Nilsson rehearsing the Orest-Elektra recognition scene with Donald McIntyre , a tall , gray-haired baritone , who plays her brother , and Paul Mills , a young , bespectacled man , who is the opera 's stage director . As Mr. Mills cued the singers from the production book , Miss Nilsson froze in delight for a Few moments , hurled herself forward into Mr. McIntyre 's arms , and then pulled back from him and began to sing a tender lyrical passage . Mr. McIntyre sank to his knees on a shallow step between two flat gray rocks , and Miss Nilsson stopped suddenly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do next , " she said , turning to Mr. Mills . " You cross in back of Donald , " Mr. Mills said , pointing down the steps to the edge of a large flat rock in the center of the stage , " and go down front to sing the next part of the aria . " " Oh , that 's marvellous ! " Miss Nilsson said , with a giggle . " I can sit ! In this role , you need every bit of rest you can get . "
