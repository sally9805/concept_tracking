As always , the youngest arms are the most fragile . " They ' re all major league prospects , " said Jack Aker , the former Met and Yankee pitcher who manages the Tidewater Tides , the Mets ' Class AAA farm club . " Someday , they ' re going to pitch in the big leagues . It ' s a shame we aren ' t a year more advanced , but we ' re not . They ' re going to get there , eventually. " // With that confidence comes a quiet hope . " You hope they survive the four or five years in the minor leagues , " Aker said . " The mortality rate is pretty severe . It could be as high as maybe 20 percent that have arm problems of one sort or another . I think it ' s much higher nowadays than it used to be , and I think it ' s from the strain of throwing so many breaking balls in grammar school , high school and college. " // The staff earned run average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Columbus in a league where the next closest figure , in the most recent weekly statistic , was 4. 16 . " It ' s as good a triple-A staff as I ' ve ever seen , " said Dave Rosenfield , the general manager since 1969 , when the staff included Jon Matlack , Jim Bibby , Danny Frisella and Steve Renko. // Ron Darling , who was pitching for Yale against Harvard a little more than a year ago , has a record of 6-4 with an earned run average of 2. 92 . Scott Holman , whose career was in jeopardy a year ago , is 7-5 with an e. r. a. of 3. 54. // Brent Gaff , a 23-year-old right-hander , has won eight of 12 decisions with an e. r. a. of 3. 34 . Walt Terrell , Friday ' s winning pitcher who was acquired with Darling from Texas in the trade for Lee Mazzilli , is 5-7 after a poor start . And Rick Ownbey , who enjoys Virginia Beach but would prefer Jones Beach for professional reasons , has a 4-4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Their experiences have taught them that even the best minor league pitcher has no guarantees when he takes the final step to the majors . " Whatever happens , you ' re not in control , " said Ownbey. who understands there are no guarantees . Both of his near no-hitters became losses . He is 24 , with blond hair and a talent for throwing a Frisbee that he developed on beaches in southern California . His talent has even led to negotiations for an endorsement with a Frisbee manufacturer . All he has to do is reach the major leagues . <> <> A Realistic View // " You can be as awesome as awesome can be , and not go , " Ownbey said . " I ' ve come a long way . Still , I ' m just as far as I am close . I could be here for the next 10 years. " // Ownbey also knows that a pitcher ' s arm can quickly grow useless . He remembers when he was pitching in a playoff game on a cold night and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 000 degrees . I remember going out into the parking lot and laying down . You know when you drive over one of those bumps that makes you slow down ? I laid my arm on one of those. " // Ownbey had a broken blood vessel and a chipped bone in his right arm . He wore a cast for six weeks and was told to give up pitching . He was 14 years old. // Ownbey never made the varsity team in high school . " That bummed me out , " he said . In an area where baseball is as intense as the beaches are mellow , Ownbey eventually spent weekends collecting friends for their own games . " Funky baseball , " he called it. // After high school , he went to work in a factory that manufactured doorknobs . He worked different shifts , had time to go to the beach , and , when he worked at night , he discovered he could even save money. // But his job outlook changed . " I took a look around , " Ownbey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 10 years , 11 years . And I knew they didn ' t think they ' d still be there , just like me . " <> <> Drafted by the Pirates // A coach had thought Ownbey could become a successful junior college pitcher . Ownbey went to Santa Ana Junior College in the fall of 1979 , four years after he had graduated from high school . " I had my cleats and glove in a grocery bag , " he said . Ownbey was drafted that winter by Pittsburgh , before the season started . But the Pirates wanted to see some results before making an offer , and he had been having trouble with his elbow. // The following June , after his first season , the Mets made Ownbey their 13th choice in the secondary draft . Within a year , a weekend hobby had become a serious job. // Scott Holman , a 23-year-old righthander , was an all-league pitcher in his junior and senior high school seasons in Oxnard , Calif . This season , Holman has consistently thrown without pain in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he led the International League with four shutouts and an earned run average of 1. 99. // " A year ago this spring , " Aker said , " he couldn ' t throw the ball across this room . " Holman had been in pain since the night following the opening game of the 1980 season at Tidewater . It was the start of his second Class AAA season after he had moved steadily through the Met system . Holman had pitched on a cold day , and that night , he could barely lift his arm. // " I thought , ' What did I do ? ' " Holman said . <> <> Advice From Bamberger // For almost two years , Holman wondered what had happened to him . Examinations found few answers . " I thought about it , " Holman said . " But I really didn ' t have anything to fall back on , actually . I could go back to school . I was 21 , back then . But I don ' t know what I ' d want to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I couldn ' t tell you what I ' d do if I couldn ' t play this. " // Then late last year , George Bamberger , the Mets ' manager who was then still working for the Milwaukee organization , offered Holman some advice. // " He said the best thing I could do was throw every day , " Holman said . " He told me Jim Palmer had the same thing I was going through . He said I just had to throw every day . I started throwing every day , and I didn ' t have any more pain . I was so happy . I just reared back . I didn ' t try to throw breaking pitches or anything . I was like a kid with new toys . " <> <> Long Trip From Queens // Dave Von Ohlen , 23 , is going out of his way to make the trip from Flushing High School in Queens to Shea Stadium . The trip normally takes a short walk to the subway , and a ride that lasts one stop. // Von @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six years . It has included a backward step , taken last summer when he threw a fastball in a game and then spent two months with his left arm in a sling with a broken bone near his elbow . He has appeared 21 times this year , all in relief , with no decisions and an e. r. a. of 4. 38 . " If I hadn ' t broken my arm , who knows ? " he said . " Maybe I ' d be in the big leagues now. " // Ron Darling is the lucky one . Throughout his college career at Yale University and now in his second minor league season , Darling said , he has never had an arm problem . He does not even rest his arm in ice after a game. // Darling ' s progress has been as remarkable as his health . When Darling left Yale to join the Tulsa Class AA team in the Texas Rangers organization , someone wondered how long he thought it would take to reach the major leagues . " I thought I ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just over a year ago . Even after the trade that sent Mazzilli to Texas and brought Darling to an organization already deep in pitching prospects , his timetable has not changed . " He ' s probably made the quickest progress of any of the pitchers , " Aker said. // That progress has been especially unusual in an organization that prefers to advance its pitchers slowly , to protect their confidence . " This is pretty quick , " Darling says now . <> <> Darling Highly Regarded // " Even though he was a college pitcher , " Aker said , " very few of our college draft choices start at the Double-A level . He could be a real exception to the rule . I have no doubts in my mind that he will be a fine major league pitcher . He could be ready next spring. // " It ' s going to take another month to see if any of these guys are ready to help them this year . Some of them could go and win a game here or there , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the prospects cling to their hope . " Was I finished ? " Von Ohlen said . " No way . Not unless I couldn ' t throw the ball. " // " I worked too hard to come back , " Holman said . Malcolm Moran //
