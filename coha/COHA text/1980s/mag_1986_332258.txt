The presidential papers of Franklin Roosevelt , who was elected to four terms in office and served more than twelve years , are housed in a 72,000-sq. - ft. library in Hyde Park , N.Y . The presidential papers of Gerald Ford , who was never elected to the office and served less than three years , are housed in not one but two buildings , in Ann Arbor and Grand Rapids , Mich. , with a combined area of 80,000 sq . ft . <P> Appalled at the cost of maintaining such increasingly extravagant monuments to Executive Branch ego ( currently running at $14.6 million annually ) , Congress a fortnight ago passed a bill limiting the size of future presidential libraries . Ronald Reagan promised to sign the measure into law  --  but only after pressuring the bill 's authors to exempt the presidential library he plans to build at Stanford University .
