Although some Americans seem a bit skeptical about the news that Russians invented baseball , or lapta , as it has been known for the past 60 or 70 Soviet pennant races , the matter is old hat to knowledgeable fans . As Izvestia recently explained to its readers , Russian emigres brought their ancient national pastime to what is now California 200 years ago , with batters striking at a ball with a stick and fielders throwing the ball at opposition players to register outs . <P> The Russian origin of American baseball is a simple fact and a closed issue , but Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev , jocularly dubbed " Goose Glasnost " by the Professional Lapta Writers Association , has graciously allowed speculation on how the game actually got to America . Pravda believes it was stolen by a Marine guard at the U.S. embassy in Moscow who scurrilously wheedled details of lapta out of an unwary Russian cook during an evening of illicit and probably drug-induced lovemaking sometime during the mid-19th century . <P> Another school of thought holds that the game arose in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earliest people 's explorers , Eric the Red , who is said to have founded a team named for himself in what is now Cincinnati . Other equally respected laptologists maintain that the spirited game evolved from the famous sporting rides of the cossacks . In this view , games occurred spontaneously on the Russian steppes , with peasants hurling stones up at the fabled horsemen in attempts to achieve outs , while the free- swinging cossacks were responsible for most of the offense . The amazing success of the cossacks , who often went undefeated for decades at a time , is sometimes cited by Izvestia as proof that polo as well as baseball originated in sports-minded Russia . <P> This pro-cossack school generally aligns itself with Izvestia 's West Coast theory of American baseball . In this opinion , the first American team was not the Cincinnati Reds but the Los Angeles Engels , named for the wealthy crony who liked to toss the lapta around with Karl Marx , the first great theoretician of the game and the main reason why so many modern lapta stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialectical theory of lapta : the pitchers are always ahead of the hitters , and vice versa . Marx 's classic one-liner about lapta , " Nice right-wing deviationists finish last , " ranks with Lenin 's famous admonition about the Russian psyche : " Anyone who wishes to understand the Russian soul had better learn lapta . " <P> It is Stalin and his successors , though , who deserve credit for expanding the ancient national pastime from a merely local amusement to a truly global game . The historic postwar expansion brought coveted big league franchises to such deserving cities as Warsaw , Budapest , Havana , Prague and now even Kabul , where an all-rookie team of Afghan players altered traditional notions of defense by employing the first heat-seeking laptas during regular-season play . Much like the introduction of the corked bat and the designated hitter in the U.S. , the Afghan innovation has clearly irritated a few hidebound older fans back in Moscow , who constantly demand that the commissioner " lower the mound " in mountainous Afghanistan to bring offense and defense back into classic balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
