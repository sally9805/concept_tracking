The standard repast is a little bowl of caviar with toast points , a bit of chopped egg , the usual . And , invariably , a thimble or two of ice-cold vodka . Once , a long time ago , Champagne and caviar were thought to be a perfect match . And it is true that , at their best , they are both deluxe . But a good marriage needs more than that to last and , though their names continue to be linked romantically , they really haven ' t gotten along for years . For my money , the oily fish eggs ruin good Champagne. // Consequently , Caviar Kaspia , at about the time I first came upon it 20 years ago , was saddled with a stock of good but aging Champagnes . I think it was the late Martin Bamford , an Englishman who directed Chateau Loudenne in Bordeaux , who first discovered this extraordinary cache . After all , it was Mr. Bamford who first realized that Prunier Traktir , the famous Paris fish restaurant , had enormous stocks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for the plundering. // If Prunier ' s old waiters ever wondered why an eager group of young Britishers and Americans suddenly began ordering prewar clarets with their sole meuniere , they never let on , other than to acknowledge that " oui , justement , m ' sieur , " the prices were indeed low. // Alas , Caviar Kaspia ' s stocks were much smaller and , what with California restaurateurs carrying off jeroboams of 1949 Pommery , the game was soon ended . What remained , at least for one player , was a lasting weakness for big bottles and , especially , for old Champagne. // The Champagne people , who may be the world ' s best salesmen , are adept at having it both ways . When Californians say their wine has tremendous aging potential but is also good for current drinking , everyone smiles indulgently . The Champagne guys , however , pull it off. // Accepted wisdom holds that Champagne is ready to drink when it leaves the wine shop . And it is . Indeed , the Champagne houses strongly suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumed without undue delay . They even caution against Champagnes that have been left too long on a merchant ' s shelves , subject to damaging heat and strong light. // The Champagne producers note that they are required by law to age nonvintage Champage at least a year and their vintage Champagne at least three years before release , which is quite a bit of time for a white wine . What aging does for Champagne is to change it ; for the better , some fans say ; for the worse , the rest insist. // Someone with a couple of bottles of Moet &; Chandon brut stashed in a closet for a son or daughter ' s 21st birthday is almost certain to be disappointed when the big day comes - by the wine , if not by the child . The wine will be flat , probably brown and unpleasant to taste and smell . Vintage Champagnes hold up better than nonvintage , but only if properly cellared , like any other table wine. // Even with the best of care , older Champagnes oxidize and lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a mellow , almost nutty flavor that seems to match their golden color and , if some of the bubbles remain , a creamy consistency that is unique in wine . It so happens that there are people who like their Champagne that way. // In his famed " Notes on a Cellar-Book , " published in England in 1920 , George Saintsbury assumed that good Champagne would be cellared . The best bottle he could recall was the 1857 Perrier-Jouet , which he bought in May 1884 , when , he said , it had " a deep amber color " and was " nearly but not quite still. " // He bought some of the 1874 Perrier-Jouet at the same time . It was , he said , " just in perfection , 10 years old , all rawness gone , but sparkle in fullest force . " So what did he do then ? He mixed them . The combination , he said , was better than either of the two on its own. // Speaking of the 1893 Veuve Clicquot , Professor Saintsbury noted that at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitterness . " But , he went on , the wine came around when it was 17 years old and " it became a very perfect wine. " // Bollinger , one of the last of the Champagne firms to remain in the hands of the family that founded it , does not release its renowned R.D. , or Recently Disgorged , Champagne for 10 years or more . During that time , the wine rests " on the lees " in the Bollinger cellars , that is , with the fermented yeast cells still in the bottle . They are removed , or disgorged , shortly before the Champagne is released . Christian Bizot , the president of Bollinger , has from time to time served Bollinger Champagnes dating back as far as 1911. // Krug , another of the small premium producers , recently began selling some very old vintages , including its fabled 1928 , by the single bottle to favored customers . Clearly , the Champagne professionals have both fondness and respect for their older wines. // In noting that vintage Champagnes are thought to age better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wines are superior to those that are not . This is not necessarily the case . Each Champagne producer strives to develop its own style of Champagne . To do so , it blends wines from many different vintages , often achieving the smoothness and balance that a vintage wine achieves only after several years in the bottle. // In a departure from the practice elsewhere , vintage years are proclaimed a committee , in this case the C.I.V.C. or Comite Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne , the professional organization of growers and producers . The individual Champagne houses can make a vintage wine that year if they choose , but they don ' t have to . The industry has become a bit cynical about vintages of late . In the 1950 ' s and 1960 ' s , vintages were declared about half of the time . So far , every year in the 1980 ' s , except 1987 , has been a vintage year. // For the occasional Champagne drinker , nonvintage wines are easily the best buys and often the most attractive to drink . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super-Champagnes like Dom Perignon from Moet &; Chandon , Roederer Cristal , Veuve Clicquot La Grande Dame and Mumm Rene Lalou . These can be , and usually are , exceptionally fine Champagnes , but they can cost up to five times as much as the same producers ' nonvintage wines . The rose prestige Champagnes can go even higher. // For rock stars and casino high-rollers , the labels may be worth the extra expense . And , O.K. , for a handful of connoisseurs as well . But with Taittinger Comtes de Champagne Rose 1981 going for around $80 , and Taittinger Brut , a light-bodied but delightful Champagne , for about $20 , anyone else should think twice before making the extra outlay these wines require. //
