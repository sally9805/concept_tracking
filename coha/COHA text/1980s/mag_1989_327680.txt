BORN YESTERDAY by Garson Kanin <P> The audience applauds when the curtain comes up on the set , a swank Washington hotel suite , and again for the arrivals of the four leading players , each familiar from a TV series . Alas , those are just about the final occasions for enthusiasm in the labored , preachy and mostly unfunny revival of Born Yesterday that opened on Broadway this week . When the show debuted in 1946 , it made stars of Paul Douglas and Judy Holliday and cemented the reputation of playwright Garson Kanin as a wry social commentator . <P> This time , Edward Asner ( Lou Grant ) achieves the seemingly impossible by overplaying the loudmouth junkyard magnate Harry Brock , who is eight parts tyrant to one part teddy bear . Madeline Kahn ( Oh Madeline ) gets laughs as his fed-up mistress who sets out to acquire couth and literacy , but cute faces and cunning timing do not add up to a believable person . As the crusading journalist who sets out to trap Brock and woo away his woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only Franklin Cover ( The Jeffersons ) , as a sozzled , shopworn and sardonic Washington fixer , evokes a credible human being . <P> The biggest loser is Kanin . His script , considered an American classic , either has dated badly or was overrated to start . It is a political , moral and especially a rhetorical muddle ; its most grandiloquent speeches sound like discarded first drafts for a lesser Frank Capra movie . At the end , a Senator gets away with taking a bribe and Brock apparently gets away with murder , all with the connivance of the supposed hero and heroine . That may echo how some spectators feel about the outcome of recent insider-trading cases , but Kanin seemingly intended a shout of triumph , not this cynical sigh . By W.A.H . III
