As he waited for a traffic light to change in Managua , a hotel driver named Andres Garcia idly furled and unfurled a tiny American flag that he had been given while making a delivery to the U.S. embassy . A passing policeman , seeing the flag , pulled Garcia , 45 , over to the curb and searched him . He discovered U.S. dollars in the driver 's pocket and promptly threw him in jail . <P> Garcia 's fate is a telling sign of the nervous mood in Managua these days . The Sandinista regime is repressing any activity that may be construed as disloyal . In the process , the nine-man Sandinista Directorate does not hesitate to trample on civil rights , as a report released last week by the New York City-based International League for Human Rights makes all too clear . The government has also embarked on a military buildup , based on its insistence that the country is now on a virtual war footing with the U.S. The rationale for a buildup was strengthened last month when the U.S. House of Representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The extent of the military escalation is not clear .

Two weeks ago , Roman Catholic Bishop Pablo Antonio Vega , a critic of the regime , was forced into exile in Honduras . The move drew sharp criticism of the Sandinistas from Pope John Paul II during his pastoral visit to Colombia last week . The Pontiff delivered a speech declaring that he found Vega 's expulsion a " nearly incredible act " that was reminiscent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin America were persecuted . Vega , the second-ranking Catholic prelate in Nicaragua , was taken to the Honduran border by Sandinista police on July 5 . <P> The antichurch actions followed closely on the heels of the June 26 shutdown of La Prensa , the only remaining opposition daily in Managua . The 60- year-old newspaper 's campaign against Dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle once helped to put the revolutionary regime in power . Even so , Nicaragua 's President Daniel Ortega Saavedra insists that La Prensa has become a vehicle for CIA propaganda and will remain closed until the " war " is over .
