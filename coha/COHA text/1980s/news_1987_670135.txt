Practicing medicine these days can bring more aggravation than satisfaction . Alan Zelicoff , an internist in Albuquerque , N.M. , spends much of his 75-hour workweek fighting with bureaucrats and administrators . He has been practicing five years but still has about $100 , 000 of medical-school loans and related debts to repay . He is miserable and depressed . " I feel deceived , " says the 33-year-old doctor . " If someone had told me that this is what it would be like , I never would have done it . " Roberta Berrien , 42 , a physician in Northampton , Mass. , still believes in making house calls . But she often gets yelled at by patients . " I ' m standing on my head for them , but I don ' t feel appreciated , " she says . She won ' t put up with it much longer ; she has just accepted a job effective in July as the head of a university health service . Richard E. Stiles Sr. , 66 , of Winchester , Mass. , quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had become so distrustful that he was often ordering lab studies and X-rays for legal documentation rather than for diagnosis . He began writing down verbatim what patients told him , so that he could use their own words in court if necessary . He had expected to end his urology practice gradually , then consult with younger doctors on their cases . But , fed up , he retired two years ago . " Once , being a doctor was a noble profession , " he says . " But in the last years , it became just a job . " Many doctors besides these three have become disenchanted with their calling . For them , medicine as an art is vanishing and the paper work is suffocating . Disputes with insurers and government agencies eat up time and energy . Malpractice suits are a constant threat . The once-sacred relationship between doctor and patient has deteriorated in many cases into an impersonal  --  and often adversarial  --  business transaction . Doctors feel reduced to the role of vendors . Certainly , the changes that produce this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of providers , for example , and a tighter rein on medical bills . Legislators and consumer advocates note , too , that many of the regulations were prompted by physicians ' misconduct and refusal to regulate themselves . And they contend that the threat of malpractice liability helps to ensure better care . Even some doctors find little merit in their colleagues ' complaints . They note that physicians ' incomes , which average $113 , 000 annually , are still far above most people ' s . Despite the attendant hardships , they say , it is still a privilege to be a doctor . Other doctors wonder . Dr. Zelicoff finds that he and his colleagues are meeting several hours a week to discuss such things as purchasing , marketing strategies and new income sources . " Not only am I uninterested in this task ; I am completely unprepared for it , " Dr. Zelicoff says . " Yet if we aren ' t aggressive in the marketplace , we will be unable to practice the skills we spent eight years perfecting . " No one knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t available , but there are many indications that the disillusionment is widespread . More young doctors are quitting their practices , and more middle-aged and older doctors are switching careers or retiring early . The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says that one-eighth of its 18 , 000 members dropped the obstetrics side of their specialty in 1985 , a 37% rise from the dropout rate two years earlier . Officials of the organization attribute the departures to frustration over rising malpractice-insurance premiums and greater liability risks . Obstetrics is the specialty hardest hit by malpractice suits . In Illinois , where a physician-owned and - operated company insures about half of the state ' s 16 , 000 practicing doctors , retirements among those insured by the company rose 96% , to 135 , last July through December , compared with the year-earlier period . A member of the insurer ' s board calls the retirements a response to stricter malpractice-policy terms and other frustrations . The Massachusetts Medical Society says an informal survey of 2 , 200 physicians found that 17% recently decided to retire early or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nationally , the Physician Executive Management Center , which counsels doctors who want to switch to other careers , says the number of doctors seeking its advice has quadrupled over the past five years . Similarly , membership in the American Academy of Medical Directors , an organization of physicians who are getting involved in the business of health-care management , has risen to 2 , 500 this year from 400 three years ago . " I can ' t remember a time when there ' s been more discomfort and soul-searching , " says Arnold Relman , who travels around the country speaking to thousands of physicians every year as editor of the New England Journal of Medicine . Much of the dissatisfaction can be traced to the revolutionary changes occurring in health care . Doctors now compete for patients with HMOs , or health-maintenance organizations , and other group practices . Also , practitioners are subject to more regulations than before , another erosion of their autonomy . Throughout the country , the government ' s Medicare guidelines called DRGs , for diagnosis-related groups , dictate how much hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These guidelines determine , in effect , how long patients are hospitalized . Doctors view the rules as a desecration of the standard of individual care . " It becomes a matter of treating arthritis in general , rather than arthritis in Mrs. Smith , and doctors don ' t like that , " says Leon Eisenberg , professor of social medicine at Harvard Medical School . Some in the profession worry that the quality of care will decline if large numbers of doctors leave at the height of their talent or if the brightest students choose other professions because of the burdens of practicing medicine . " We can ' t continuously clip at the ankles of the profession and pretend that it doesn ' t have consequences , " says Paul Batalden , a retired doctor and former government health official who now works for Hospital Corp. of America . Reforms in medical care , he says , can ' t be allowed to " destroy the morale of those responsible for providing it . " Adds Michael Whitcomb , the dean of the University of Missouri ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that may not be enough to get doctors through the problems they face every day . " Dr. Stiles , the retired urologist , recalls a happier era . Thirty years ago , during what he considers " the golden days of medicine , " one of his patients had bladder cancer . Techniques for treatment weren ' t well developed then , so Dr. Stiles and his colleagues decided to try something experimental : They burned the inside of the bladder to destroy the tumor . At the time , Dr. Stiles thought the patient ' s prognosis was poor . But she survived the operation and is still alive today . " She sends me a Christmas card every year , " Dr. Stiles says proudly . " That sort of outcome is tremendously satisfying and exciting for a doctor . " In more recent years , Dr. Stiles wouldn ' t have dreamed of taking such a bold step . Although he was sued only once in his entire career , he came to feel that he was at the mercy of his patients and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record-keeping precautions , his insurer became more timid . Dr. Stiles believed that the lawsuit filed against him was unjustified . But rather than defend him and his reputation in court , his malpractice carrier chose to settle it for $30 , 000 . The decision dismayed him . Says Dr. Stiles , " It felt like a surrender . " Younger doctors complain of a different kind of surrender . Five years ago , Jeffrey Botkin was enthusiastic when he finished his pediatrics residency and joined a 35-doctor practice in Boulder , Colo . As part of the group practice , he expected to use the latest techniques in pediatric care , and he knew he wouldn ' t be encumbered by bookkeeping chores . But by the end of his fourth year , Dr. Botkin ' s hopes had been dashed . Though he had spent his residency focusing on serious childhood illnesses , most of the children he treated in practice were healthy . Moreover , he was expected to see as many patients as possible . So every time he diagnosed a case of diabetes or encountered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case to the endocrinologist or another specialist in his group , instead of treating the patient himself . " During my medical training , I developed skills to deal with almost constant challenges , " Dr. Botkin says . " But in my practice , those skills were irrelevant . " Increasingly , it became difficult for him to retain information about advancements in treatment he read about in medical journals . Frustrated and bored , he left his practice and enrolled in Johns Hopkins University for a master ' s degree in public health . " I knew private practice would be different , " he says , " but I didn ' t realize the extent to which it would become routine . " For other doctors , even the financial rewards of practicing medicine are disappearing . Dr. Berrien , the practitioner who still believes in making house calls , works longer hours but earns significantly less than her 1983 income of $68 , 000 . As the main breadwinner for her family of four , she worries about the strain of financing a college education for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the University of Maine at Orono , won ' t pay any more than she now makes , but she is looking forward to a more stable income and fewer irritations . Dr. Berrien used to have two partners in her internal-medicine practice . The group treated hundreds of patients every year and the office manager handled the receptionist and bookkeeping chores for all of them . Over the last two years , Dr. Berrien ' s partners left to take administrative jobs , and she has carried the load alone . But the paper work has mounted so much lately that her office manager regularly works overtime just to keep up with the finances . The doctor says her fees often get mired in the billing bureaucracy . Typically , she bills patients , who tell her to bill the insurer or some other third party . If the insurance company refuses to pay , she must rebill the patient . Moreover , some health plans don ' t reimburse Dr. Berrien for the full cost of her services . In many cases , she must accept $21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process is frustrating and expensive . " How can I run a business like this ? " she asks . But money is only part of the problem . Dr. Berrien says the emotional rewards of caring for sick people are also vanishing . Patients loudly complain to her when their health insurers refuse to pay their medical bills or when they are unhappy with hospital and laboratory fees . Richard J. Schilling was so apprehensive about red tape that he gave up his surgical practice in Bloomington , Ind. , after 24 years . Now he spends two months a year in village hospitals in Africa and helps organize shipments of medical supplies there . Dr. Schilling was 54 and at the height of his career when he stopped practicing five years ago . He and his wife live comfortably from investment income in a lakeside home in Traverse City , Mich . To occupy his time when he isn ' t abroad , he fishes , sails and plays with his grandchildren . He can ' t resume his practice part time because his income wouldn ' t cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a place for me anymore , " he says .
