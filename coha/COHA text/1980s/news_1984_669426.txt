// NOT too hard to guess who these words by Christopher Hibbert describe . Contributions to the British notion of Christmas festivities have been made by Dylan Thomas and Thomas Hardy , by E. T. A. Hoffmann , Walt Disney , and even Bing Crosby ( it ' s true : a ' ' White Christmas ' ' is rarely more than a ' ' dream ' ' in these green islands ) . But there is little doubt that Charles Dickens remains the unchallenged ' ' jolly giant ' ' who , like the ' ' Ghost of Christmas Present ' ' in his story ' ' A Christmas Carol , ' ' ' ' pleasantly haunts ' ' this season in England - and indeed all over the British Isles. // Like a lank and bearded Good Fairy atop a Christmas Tree , this compelling Victorian novelist waved his wand over the seasonal imagination back in the 1840s . He has been associated with all the bonhomie - the ' ' genial face ' ' . . . ' ' sparkling eye ' ' . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ' ' cheery voice ' ' of traditional Christmas ever since. // Things change , of course , but visitors to Britain will still encounter festive signs galore . Pantomimes , for instance . Though the disappearance of the traditional pantomime has been continually bemoaned since at least the 1880s , and even the older Dickens missed the ' ' ten thousand million delights ' ' of the grand Christmas pantomimes of his childhood , the fact is that modern versions of ' ' Mother Goose ' ' and ' ' Cinderella , ' ' of ' ' Dick Whittington , ' ' ' ' Aladdin , ' ' and ' ' Puss in Boots , ' ' still play to capacity audiences throughout Britain in the 1980s . From Chichester on the South coast ( Spike Milligan in ' ' Babes in the Wood ' ' ) to Glasgow ( Ricky Fulton in a particularly Scottish version of ' ' Jack and the Beanstalk ' ' - they ' d never accept a packaged English ' ' panto ' ' up here ) ; from Bristol in the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panto ' ' survives and flourishes. // Essentially a mixture of fairy tale and burlesque , song , dance , and knockabout comedy , it has a ' ' Dame ' ' ( a man ) and a ' ' Principal Boy ' ' ( a young woman ) and a Transformation Scene . It is colorful , magical , silly , fanciful , and definitely for children. // There may , in fact , be something of a resurgence of traditional ' ' panto ' ' at the moment . London offers several this year . The most ambitious is ' ' Humpty-Dumpty ' ' at the Dominion , a large-scale success originating last year in Cardiff . Really a fairy-story musical , it stars popular TV comedian-ventriloquist Keith Harris . This ' ' Humpty-Dumpty ' ' claims to be the first truly spectacular pantomime in London since the Palladium stopped producing them five or six years ago. // Elsewhere there is a trend back to more modest , often locally produced pantomimes , with no big names , no star-spots , and an uninterrupted story line . Some directors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' In Nottingham , for instance , after an eight-year gap , the Playhouse is presenting just this sort of panto . It is in marked contrast to the same city ' s annual , star-spangled extravanganza at the Theatre Royal . You can take your pick in Nottingham. // Carol concerts abound everywhere , indoors and out . They are sung in concert halls , churches , hotels , cathedrals , shopping precincts . Round the base of the 70-foot Norway pine , covered with white lights , in Trafalgar Square , London , carols are sung by various charities for five hours every evening from Dec. 13 to Christmas Eve . This tree is a gift to Britain from the people of Oslo to mark the wartime links between Norway and Britain , and the concerts have been given every year since 1947. // The ever-increasing numbers of handbell-ringing teams in Britain are very active at Christmas time . If you happen , for example , to be in Chester , you will hardly be able to avoid hearing the Blacon High School Handbell Ringers . Not only do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 and 18 in Chester Cathedral , they also play for charity in The Forum shopping center ( Chester has ancient Roman connections ) . And they do 15-minute spots at dinner dances at various hotels round this beautiful old city. // Ballet is popular at Christmas in Britain - particularly ' ' The Nutcracker . ' ' The Scottish ballet is doing it in Glasgow . And the London Festival Ballet is once again performing its version at the Royal Festival Hall on the South Bank of the Thames. // The never-grow-up story of ' ' Peter Pan ' ' is being presented for the third year at the Barbican by the Royal Shakespeare Company. // ' ' Toad of Toad Hall ' is celebrating its 25th consecutive London presentation . This is A. A. Milne ' s dramatization of Kenneth Grahame ' s ' ' The Wind in the Willows , ' ' a particular favorite with those aged 4 to 12. // A variety of Christmas events occurs all over the country : plays and parties on all sides . Few institutions miss the opportunity to celebrate - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Scotland , where traditionally New Year ' s is the big event , Christmas has caught on. // Scottish nine-year-olds are as keen on the season as their English counterparts . One says she gets so excited on Christmas morning she doesn ' t ' ' feel like eating breakfast . ' ' Another , that Christmas is special for ' ' happiness and joy and opening all your presents and remembering it ' s Jesus ' birthday . ' ' A boy says , ' ' I enjoy my mum thanking me for the present I bought her . ' ' And all sing the praises of Christmas food. // Christmas shopping in Edinburgh and Glasgow is as frenetic as it is in Cardiff or Leeds or London . Big stores still go in for the child-attracting ' ' Santa ' s grotto . ' ' That red-and-white-coated old fellow finds himself in the oddest places - just past the Hairdressing Salon or the other side of Men ' s Sportswear . No Father Christmas , however , is placed so unusually as the one in a slate mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the one in the Llechwedd slate caverns . The kids reach him by underground tram. // And he shows up again in the cobbled square of a charming village in the Yorkshire dales called Grassington , for the three Saturdays before Christmas. // He is drawn by a white horse and stands in a distinctly Victorian carriage . This is because Grassington goes ' ' Dickensian ' ' on these three days . The villagers don Victorian costumes . Braziers in the street cook potatoes and chestnuts . The local baker sells Grannie Lister ' s Ginger Parkin , made to a 150-year-old recipe . There are Morris dancers , torchlight processions , singing , and handbell ringing . You are likely to encounter Scrooge and Fagin and Nancy and Squeers , not to mention any number of pickpockets , flower girls , and shoeshine boys . You might even run into Christopher Dickens , great-great- ( great ? ) - grandson of the novelist , who happens to be an organ-builder who lives nearby and last year opened the proceedings. // But can a tourist get a genuine feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a point . The ideal , of course , is to visit relatives or friends . But there are a surprising number of ways to come close . Many hotels offer ' ' Christmas Packages. ' ' // Take two in Wales , for instance , both in beautiful countryside . The Warpool Court in St. David ' s , Britain ' s smallest city , stands on a rugged peninsula in Pembrokeshire . The hotel was built in 1850 as a choir school for the tiny cathedral , but became instead a private house . Proprietor David Lloyd , a quiet-spoken , witty Welshman , promises Christmas guests a ' ' thoroughly good time . ' ' He talks of ' ' ancient atmosphere ' ' and ' ' pilgrimage ' ' ( St. David was a contemporary of Ireland ' s St. Patrick , and is a romantic , significant figure in Wales ) , of a ' ' wild seascape , ' ' of ' ' open fires , ' ' of Welsh oysters and venison and goose . ' ' We prefer goose to turkey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - though turkey is still on the menu . The four-day Christmas stay features an ' ' intimate party ' ' of guests and staff ( ' ' a classless society , ' ' he calls it ) , an evening of Welsh song , midnight mass at the cathedral , and a dance on Boxing Night. // In north Wales , near the beauty-spot village of Bettws-y-Coed , in a ' ' lovely valley , ' ' is the Plas Maenen Hotel at Llanrwst. // Nesta Wyn Owen is the friendly proprietor . She caters for about 40 guests , some of them families . ' ' We ' ve never been without children at Christmas , ' ' she says with satisfaction . She offers all the traditional ingredients and adds a distinctly Welsh flavor : Harp music , folk singing , and clog dancing on Christmas Eve ; breakfast in bed on Christmas morning . Then a carol service . After the dinner , an afternoon walk up to a crag , with a wonderful view , for those wanting it. // Mrs. Owen aims to suit all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are left in peace . But that ubiquitous gentleman ' ' Father Christmas ' ' appears once more with gifts for the children ( tapes of Welsh music , perhaps , and teddy bears for the young ones ) . A ride on one of Wales ' s popular narrow-gauge railways is offered on Boxing Day . A fancy dress party rounds things off on Boxing Night. // Another possibility would be to spend Christmas in one of the farmhouses that offer holidays in ever-increasing numbers from Land ' s End to John o ' Groats . Indeed in Scotland , Jane Buchanan , who runs the two-year-old ' ' Scottish Farmhouse Holidays ' ' from her home in Fife , has a list of attractive farmhouses all over the country - and ' ' 99 percent of them are open all year , ' ' she affirms . ' ' They are family homes to which you are warmly welcomed , ' ' she adds in her detailed brochure ( which she mails overseas ) . // I thought Alex and Margaret Hutcheson ' s early 19th-century farmhouse in Inverness-shire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sounded appealing for Christmas . They offer ' ' home cooking with fresh local produce. ' ' // ' ' How ever did you guess ? ' ' exclaimed Mrs. Buchanan . ' ' One of my favorites . They would certainly pull the stops out . ' ' She suggested another in the south - Robert and Nettie Tennant ' s farm in Lanarkshire . They have ' ' Two pigs , hens , cats , and black Labrador dogs , ' ' and Nettie breeds and trains collie sheep dogs . Plentiful home cooking , too . Nearby are the Falls of Clyde , a nature reserve , golf , riding , fishing , and walks galore . Who wouldn ' t enjoy Christmas in such a spot ? // // Additional information : Warpool Court Hotel , St. David ' s , telephone : 0437- 720300 . Plas Maenen Hotel , Llanrwst , telephone : 049-269232 .
