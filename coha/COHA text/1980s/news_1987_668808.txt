Q  --  Our 6-year-old Samoyed began licking his front paws , and after a few months something resembling blood started to stain his front legs and now completely covers the fronts of them . Two vets examined him and could find nothing wrong . They suggested that perhaps he was allergic to something in the grass because his condition seems to get worse in the spring , summer and fall . The vets could give no other reason for this discoloration except that his saliva was causing it . Could his food be the problem ? Is he allergic to something ? Would testing be necessary , harmful and expensive ? We have tried to discourage him from licking his paws by spraying Bitter Apple , sprinkling pepper , using a weak bleach solution and wrapping his front paws in gauze , but nothing works . A  --  I believe the cause of these streaks is a reaction between enzymes in the dog ' s saliva and protein in his hair . This causes the reddish brown color . There are a number of possibilities for why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that this is a behavioral problem he developed in moments of boredom or anxiety when he was lying down . Rather than just lying quietly , he starts to work his mouth , and what ' s most accessible is the front of his legs . To try to stop the licking , there ' s a product containing the veterinary drugs Syn-otic and Banamene . It has shown the greatest promise of all the topical treatments that have been tried . There might be an underlying allergy causing the trouble . However , it ' s unlikely because of where your dog licks . A dog with allergic dermatitis usually will go for its belly , elbows , feet , ears , rear and the top of its back rather than the front legs . Q  --  My 9-year-old Afghan hound has been treated for a mast cell tumor on her front leg . The original tumor was removed eight months ago , followed by 10 treatments of radiation therapy . The tumor reappeared in two spots , and these were removed two months ago , but again a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to treat . Using an anticancer drug possibly can result in the death of the animal . Is there any other more successful treatment method ? Also , should the tumor be removed again , or should I try to maintain the dog on medication that has serious side effects over long-term use ? A  --  Mast cell tumors often can be malignant . The treatment recommended depends upon what stage the cancer is in . Sometimes it will respond to radiation , sometimes to chemotherapy and many times to nothing . Treatment depends upon the location and size of the cancer and the microscopic appearance of the cells . Chemotherapy can be very effective for some types of cancer , even without using products that cause extreme side effects . But with some problems , such as your dog ' s , the necessary chemicals can be highly toxic . Whether the lump should be removed depends on how adversely surgery would affect your dog . If he recovers quickly from surgery and if the mass is causing problems such as pain or bleeding , then remove another lump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t bother your dog and the surgery knocks him out quite significantly for a few days ( which can be a risk in an Afghan ) , then you might want to avoid surgery . Q  --  Is there such a thing as a hearing aid for dogs ? A  --  No , and I don ' t think there will ever be one . The major reason is that , to be effective , hearing aids need to fit well . With deaf humans there ' s a variation in size of the ear canal , but not a great one . However , among dogs , some ear canals would require a hearing aid the size of a radish or , for a Yorkshire terrier , a pea . Giant breeds such as St. Bernards would need nearly the size of a lemon . A canine hearing aid is not a feasible commercial venture because of this fitting problem . Also , for a hearing aid to be functionally comfortable , it must be tuned in to just the right volume . If it ' s too loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s too soft , it ' s obviously of no help . There ' s just no way to fine-tune a hearing aid on a dog . Q  --  My 9-year-old male Weimaraner has a slight hernia and a problem with incontinence . When he stands , occasionally a few drops of urine escape . This does not seem to bother the dog , but is creating a housekeeping problem . He has been treated with antibiotics for a possible urinary tract infection and now is taking an antihistamine , which is not helping much . Is there a solution ? A  --  Incontinence in an older dog can be due to numerous problems , some of which should be corrected medically or surgically and some that are almost impossible to help . There can be bladder disorders , kidney disorders , prostate problems ( which would be high on the list for an older male dog ) and the adverse effect of a hernia . If your dog has a perineal hernia , that may have a connection with the incontinence . To know which of these is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done include a blood work-up , a urinalysis and an X-ray of the bladder area , including some contrast X-ray studies . Based on the results of these tests , the treatment might be a medical one . Several different types of bladder problems respond to medication . Or it might be a surgical one that could include repairing the hernia , dealing with a prostate problem and finally possibly neutering the dog . Q  --  In the last month my 5-year-old Doberman has been " dancing " with her hind legs . This happens when she is standing , and she ' s quick to sit down . The vet believes this disturbance to be Dancing Doberman Syndrome , a rare case in which the spinal cord at the end of the back vertebrae is space occupied . My vet suggested I get a second and , if I choose , a third opinion . Are you familiar with this syndrome ? A  --  I ' ve never heard of it . Many Dobermans , when they ' re excited , act like they ' re dancing on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than exuberant behavior . There are so many possibilities for problems located at the back end of a dog , including lesions involving the spinal cord at the base of the back . Consequently , no assumptions should be made until all the possibilities have been checked out . This may involve quite a financial investment because it includes physical exams , X-rays and , if indicated , a myelogram  --  a type of X- ray involving dye around the spinal cord to determine what may be putting pressure on it . Besides possible spinal problems , your dog should be checked for anal sack problems , arthritis and nutritional disorders . Get several opinions .
