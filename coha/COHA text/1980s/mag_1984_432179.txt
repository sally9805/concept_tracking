 | The snapshot is frightening : a grinning skeleton of a man wearing a LaCoste shirt . " Look at that , " says Paul , * 37 , a lawyer and owner of a trucking firm . " Matchsticks for arms and slits for eyes . Eighty-seven pounds and coked out of my gourd . " In the five years before the photo was taken , Paul explains , he " snorted away " his wife , his suburban home and $500,000 . After the drug ate away the cartilage inside his nose , he bought liquid cocaine and droppered it into his eyes . Then a year and a half ago , shortly after posing for the cadaverous photo , Paul pointed a .38 pistol at his head ; luckily , his girlfriend managed to wrestle it away . " That night I saw an ad on TV for a cocaine hot line , " recalls Paul , who now weighs 200 pounds .

The common perception is that more Americans than ever before are abusing drugs and alcohol while comparatively few of those already addicted are seeking help , but U.S. government officials maintain that the opposite is true : they call it " the cooling of America . " " Since 1979 , in terms of national levels of the numbers of people using drugs and , to a lesser extent , alcohol , " reports Dr. William Pollin , director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse , " there has very clearly been a peaking , a leveling off and the beginning of a downward trend . This is really a dramatic change from the explosion of past years . " In fact , the surprising possibility that there may now be more people trying to kick habits and fewer getting hooked is beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to NIDA , of the 35 million Americans who were users ( defined as those who used drugs 20 days out of the month immediately preceding the survey ) of illicit drugs in 1982 , 4.1 million used cocaine ? down from 4.5 million in 1979 . And government surveys @# indicate that between 1976 and 1981 there was an astounding 600 percent increase in the number of Americans who sought help for cocaine abuse in publicly funded programs . While there are no available statistics that reflect a surge of enrollment in the private programs that coke users prefer , experts also note that reported membership in Alcoholics Anonymous ? which has become increasingly involved with cocaine abuse ? has more than tripled since 1968 , from 170,000 to a total of 586,000 . Candor : By all accounts , the " getting straight " movement began with an unlikely addict : former First Lady Betty Ford , who courageously announced in 1978 that she was about to enter a hospital for treatmentto combat her dependency on alcohol and painkillers . Most drug counselors agree that just as Mrs. Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it much easier for other American women to handle their own struggles with breast cancer , her public acknowledgment of her addiction to alcohol and drugs took away a great deal of the stigma and shame attached to those problems . " Betty Ford has done more to get people in treatment than any government program , " declares Dr. David Smith , who in 1967 founded ? and still runs ? the Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic in San Francisco ( box , page 69 ) . Adds Larry Meredith , program chief of San Francisco 's Community Substance Abuse Services : " Betty Ford made it okay and respectable ? almost in vogue ? to have a problem and deal with it . She has been a national treasure . " But she was only the beginning . After she went public with her problem , a stream of similar announcements from politicians , athletes and especially entertainers quickly swelled to a flood , as every actor in Hollywood suddenly seemed to be queuing up for a chance to confess all on " Good Morning , America . " Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Travanti , star of NBC 's popular " Hill Street Blues " ? have taken an active role in the crusade to help other alcoholics ; both gave up the bottle in 1973 . Some celebrities , like Elizabeth Taylor and Johnny Cash ? who both went for treatment to the Betty Ford Center that opened in 1982 at the Eisenhower Medical Center near Palm Springs , Calif. ? put out forthright press releases that 10 years ago would probably have euphemistically alluded to a hospitalization for " gastritis . " Others , like comedian Richard Pryor , spoke out only after their drug or alcohol problems landed them in public trouble . Athletes , the cherished role models of youth , were also catapulted out of the closet . A claim that 75 percent of National Basketball Association players dabbled in cocaine proved exaggerated ? but the image-conscious league and its players ' union did adopt the strongest antidrug code in pro sports . Former Super Bowl heroes like Washington Redskins safety Tony Peters and Cincinnati Bengal runner Pete Johnson were caught in the cocaine glare . In baseball , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep out the gibes of fans who resent his conviction and jail term for possession . Whether they resorted to public confession , intensive treatment or earplugs , the celebrities who went public probably opened the straight road to many of their admirers . Says Dr. Carlton Turner , special assistant to the president on drug-abuse policy : " When someone with a position of influence or name recognition says , I have an alcohol problem , ' or I have a drug problem , ' it gives a lot of other people the courage to do the same . " One of those people is Julie , 29 , a story editor for a film-production company in Hollywood , who 11 months ago joined Cocaine Anonymous and kicked a heavy cocaine and alcohol habit that was destroying her life . Julie exemplifies several significant trends that characterize a new breed of addicts who are showing up for treatment : she is a woman , she was addicted to more than one drug and she sought treatment in a program based on Alcoholics Anonymous , the venerable organization founded in 1935 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spiritual guidance . Also like Julie , a growing number of the men and women who are flocking to alcohol and drug ( A and D ) rehabilitation programs are educated members of the upper-middle class : doctors , lawyers , bankers and other professionals . Mixers : They seek help in a wide variety of settings , ranging from church basements to locked units in psychiatric hospitals to cabins with breathtaking mountain views . But what distinguishes them most from an earlier generation of addicts is " polyabuse , " the current medical buzzword that describes their dependency on a combination of alcohol and drugs , or on more than one chemical substance . An estimated 10 million Americans are problem drinkers . " But it 's very hard to find a pure alcoholic these days , " notes Paul Sherman , a Rye , N.Y. , consultant on executive substance abuse . " Most of them are mixers , " agrees Donnie Brown , executive director of Metro Atlanta Recovery Residences , Inc. , " and I 'm talking about everyone from street people all the way up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 , a Los Angeles actor and ex-abuser who started doing drugs at 15 and who got straight two years ago . " I was a garbage-can addict , " he recalls . " I was n't choosy . I took pills , drank like a fish , used hallucinogens , did cocaine . I would carry a small aspirin box which contained all the pills I needed , according to how I wanted to feel . " Cocaine users are especially likely to abuse ? and become dependent on ? a  | smorgasbord of " downers " to combat the jittery , strung-out irritability coke induces . Alcohol , sedatives and tranquilizers are widely used for this purpose , along with another depressant that a small but growing number of heavy users consider the perfect antidote to the cocaine jitters : heroin . The new candor about A and D addiction may be the catalyst that has enabled so many drinkers and drug users to throw away their pipes , syringes , pillboxes , bottles , spoons and straws , but a number of social , economic and historical influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the getting-straight movement . For one thing , the enormous numbers of young people who experimented with marijuana and LSD in the 1960s and 1970s did n't all grow up and grow out of their habits . Some kept on trying new highs and , inevitably , many of them got hooked . Now entering middle age , these " baby boomers " are trying to put their lives in order by kicking drugs . Another important factor , says NIDA 's Dr. Carl Leukefeld , is the current American enthusiasm for physical fitness and self-improvement , combined with a growing awareness of the health risks drugs and heavy alcohol use carry . Perhaps most important , America has changed its attitude toward addiction . " The alcohol and drug addict has always been looked at in a moralistic way , " says Dr. G. Douglas Talbott , a rehabilitation expert who operates the Ridgeview Institute Chemical Dependency Program in Smyrna , Ga . " But now it 's being recognized more and more that this is a disease . That perception has made more people come into treatment . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans to get help . Large businesses have realized that it is far more cost-effective to get substance-abusing employees rehabilitated than to hire and retrain new ones ; thus . many firms have developed Employee Assistance Programs ( EAP 's ) for addiction . Although many insurance plans will still @# offer coverage for treatment of alcohol but not other drugs , next month Blue Cross and Blue Shield will launch a pioneering new " substance abuse benefit " that emphasizes early identification and intervention and will cover up to 165 days of treatment . Discreet : Without insurance , the cost of getting straight can be truly prohibitive ? as much as $350 a day at posh private hospitals like Silver Hill in New Canaan , Conn. , and Laurelwood , a three-yearold psychiatric hospital near The Woodlands , Texas , that may soon become an official treatment facility for the drugplagued National Football League . Outpatient programs , of course , cost much less . At New York 's Regent Hospital , a discreet private facility that caters primarily to affluent coke addicts , an outpatient program that includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far less than the $300 to $500 that patients have typically been spending on cocaine . The seemingly insatiable demand for drug- and alcohol-rehabilitation services has spawned a thriving new American industry . Comprehensive Care Corp. , based in Newport Beach , Calif. , launched its first CareUnit hospital for A and D treatment in 1972 ; today there are 150 CareUnits in 42 states , with new ones opening up at the remarkable rate of two a month . In some cases health.are entrepreneurs have joined with chronically underused Hope and a hug in Houston 's PDAP program : Reaching out to others for the strength to survive hospitals to turn their empty wards into profitable drug dinics . In Denver , older rehab centers that once primarily treated alcoholics are now revamping their images and facilities to attract today 's younger , more hip polysubstance abuser . Staffers with some of the nonprofit programs refer disparagingly to the new moneymaking outfits as " finger-lickin ' While there is some controversy over the best way to treat addiction , the vast majority of private rehabilitation centers ? some of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as variations on a theme . The frills and activities may differ ? from strenuous hiking and aquatic relaxation to " meditation walks " and household chores ? but the basics remain the same : detoxification ( with or without medication ) , group therapy , family counseling and a long-term outpatient involvement in a self-help support group like AA , sometimes for the rest of the patient 's life . Individual psychotherapy , the rehab experts agree , is notoriously ineffective in treating addiction . " Unfortunately there are large numbers of patients who have lain on psychiatrists ' couches , month after month , intoxicated with Demerol , talking about their mothers , " observes Dr. Thomas Crowley , executive director of the University of Colorado 's highly respected Addiction Research and Treatment Services ( ARTS ) program . " What they really needed to do was stop using Demerol . " Murray Firestone , a psychologist who heads the rehab program at Beverly Glen Hospital in Los Angeles , agrees . " The No. 1 error in treating people with chemical dependency is getting seduced by other problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main problem , and if they are loaded when you treat them , you are wasting your time . " Churches : The granddaddy of treatment programs is , of course , AA , which spells out 12 steps to recovery and asks members to place their faith in a " higher power " to help them stay sober . While AA 's tenets and structure remain unaltered 49 years after its founding , there are winds of change whistling through the churches , school auditoriums and hospitals where members gather . At almost any meeting , what 's new about AA is immediately apparent ; recently , there has been a steady and sizable upswing in the number of women , young people and polydrug abusers who have joined . Under-30 membership rose 50 percent between 1977 and 1980 , and the trend continues . Women now make up one-third of the membership , compared with 22 percent in 1968 . AA has become the program of choice for such a diverse population that some meetings now attract members just from specific groups ; there are special meetings for doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and one is on posh Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills . No matter what their income is , AA members pay nothing . Chic : With the influx of younger , hipper members and a less lopsided male-female ratio , some AA meet+ ings have become decidedly more sociable , and even chic : bottles of Perrier are appearing along with the traditional coffee and cookies . Members are discouraged from dating within AA for the first year , but Julie , the Los Angeles editor , admits , " Sometimes I go to a meeting not to be uplifted but because I know a great-looking guy is going to be there . " But that does n't mean she regards her 11-month sobriety lightly . " So it 's chic , " she shrugs . " So much the better . " Whether the problem is booze , pills , pot , coke or a pharmacological potpourri , AA is often the solution that works . Indeed , many drug experts believe that all chemical addictions are different faces of the same demon , a craving so strong that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Everybody has bodily needs : to breathe , to eat , to have sex , to urinate , " observes Dr. David Fram , director of drug-abuse treatment at Washington 's Psychiatric Institute . " The best way to think of being addicted to drugs is that you have acquired another body need that you must pay attention to and that you must fulfill . " According to estimates by the American Medical Association 's Committee on Alcoholism , just as many women as men feel that " body need . " But in the past , women with alcohol and drug problems were likely to hide at home behind the convenient curtain of housewifery . Today , in most rehab programs . women account for 30 to 40 percent of patients . Immoral : But traditional attitudes still make it difficult for many women to admit to a drug or alcohol problem . " We 're still chauvinistic in our thinking about women who use o drugs , " says William Johnson of o Georgia 's Department of Human Resources . " They are thought of as weak sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily . " Apparently : the National Council on Alcoholism reports that 9 out of 10 wives of alcoholic husbands stand by them , but only 1 in 10 husbands married to alcoholic wives does the same . " Society expects a lady to drink , but not to have a drinking problem , " notes Betty Ford . " I consider it my life 's work to remove the stigma from women admitting they are alcoholics . " She has made a formidable start at the Betty Ford Center she founded with recovered alcoholic and tire- @# @#  | fortune heir Leonard Firestone . Men and women may choose to live separately during the four- to six-week program . " Women shy away from a lot of subjects when men are around , " explains the former First Lady . " Also , men tend to take advantage of women 's nurturing nature in group therapy , and the women end up worrying about the men instead of themselves . " Although the Betty Ford Center looks like a country club , the program is ascetic . The day begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all patients , including male movie stars and Elizabeth Taylor , who did n't flinch when she had to take out the garbage and hose down the patio . No telephone calls are permitted during the first five days , and television ? an addiction of a different type ? is confined to weekends . The program closely follows AA tenets , especially the emphasis on reliance on others with the same problem . The Palmer Drug Abuse Program ( PDAP ) , founded in Houston by an Episcopal minister 13 years ago , offers another regimen based on AA principles of mutual support , with a special emphasis on social activities for teen-age addicts . PDAP 's division for abusers older than 24 is whimsically called Over The Hill , or OTHers . To Jill , 42 , it was a godsend . A secretary addicted to Valium and alcohol , she first joined PDAP because her five children were all doing drugs . It took her three years to acknowledge her own problem . " Finally , " she says , " you get sick and tired of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays a prominent part at Talbott 's 50-acre Ridgeview Institute . Talbott , whose career as a prominent Dayton , Ohio , cardiologist crumbled under the weight of alcoholism and drug abuse , believes AA offers the most effective form of treatment available . " And it 's nothing more than group therapy , " he says . Talbott was instrumental in the rehabilitation of Martha Morrison , now head of the institute 's adolescent unit ( box , page 66 ) , who says he was the only one she could n't outcon . " It 's very difficult to outcon a con , manipulate a manipulator , " says the 59-year-old Talbott . In Boulder , Colo. , the Boulder Psychiatric Institute has launched an addiction program that captures the atmosphere of an exotic retreat within the confines of Boulder Memorial Hospital . Called Day At a Time , the treatment regime for up to 12 patients includes art therapy , yoga , meditation , aquatic-relaxation therapy ? and a solid AA orientation . When Sandra Haun , 32 , came to Day At a Time , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom died from alcohol-related problems ? Haun claims she was " born alcoholic " ; her mother would slip whisky into her baby bottle when she was cranky as an infant . Addicted to pot and a variety of pills as well as booze , Haun dropped out of college and drifted from job to job . One morning last year , she says , " I woke up and looked in the mirror and saw an old woman at 31 . I said to myself , If there 's a God , I hope he hears me ' . " Now in the program 's six-month aftercare phase , Haun recognizes that her recovery is only just beginning . " Alcohol is very cunning and patient , " she explains . " It will wait forever . It 's always going to be there . " Recently the special hazards facing health-care professionals have received par- ticular attention . Martha Morrison refers to the " M.D.-eity complex . Doctors say , I prescribe all these drugs , I make life-or-death decisions ; it will never happen to me ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network of specialized clinics , including two strictly for cocaine and one for addicted health-care professionals . counselors are studying an intriguing but controversial new sobriety incentive that has been described , accurately , as selfblackmail . The plan is known as contingency contracting . An addicted doctor , for example , writes a letter to the state board of medicine admitting he is an addict and surrendering his license . The letter is deposited with ARTS director Crowley , and a contract is drawn up directing Crowley to mail the letter if the patient fails ? or fails to show up for ? one of his regular urine checks for the presence of drugs . Unfortunately , some of the letters have had to be mailed . Skiing : Although alcohol and coke are sometimes called " social " drugs , addiction is fundamentally a solitary , isolating way of life . Thus , a critical aspect of treating alcohol and drug dependency is pulling the patient out of his or her self-involvement and into constructive relationships with others . At the Aspen Addiction Rehabilitation Unit of the Presbyterian/St . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others are fostered by rigorous outdoor activities that include rock climbing , crosscountry skiing , rope crossing and log walking . The cooperation required , explains program director Allen Drum , teaches patients to count on each other for help and prepares them for long-term involvement in support groups like AA , Narcotics Anonymous or Cocaine Anonymous when they leave . The three-month-old facility , which treats 10 patients at a time in its 28-day program , operates out of a converted 1945 ranch house situated at the base of scenic Buttermilk Mountain . Abusers can also benefit enormously from the involvement of their families , " This is not the kind of illness a person can have all alone , " says Howard McFadden , founder of The Ark , another A and D " retreat " ' in the Colorado Rockies . " This is a family disease . Family members need treatment , too . " In the past , AA and other rehab groups emphasized that an addict had to " hit bottom " before treatment could be effective . Now many programs encourage deliberate intervention by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrecked his life . Sometimes the direct approach works ? a firm but friendly confrontation with the addict about the likely consequences of his or her behavior . ( Both Betty Ford and Elizabeth Taylor got straight only after their 68 NEWSWEEK/JUNE 4 , 1984  | children intervened in this manner . ) In other cases , the intervening person may shock the abuser into self-realization by provoking a crisis ; a six-year-old , for example , might say to his father , " I 'm afraid of you . " Bottom : Some counselors say that families should ? if necessary ? force the abuser to go it alone without their emotional or financial support , so that he or she will hit bottom and have to face the problem . At least one psychiatrist believes this was where the Kennedy family may have made its mistake with Robert Jr. , 30 , who has long struggled with heroin dependency , and David , who died last month of a polydrug overdose at the age of 28 . With continuing protection from their family , says the physician , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were doing to themselves . Teen-agers who abuse drugs and alcohol rarely bottom out before their parents drag them ? sometimes literally kicking And screaming ? into a rehab program , and their prospects for recovery are not always bright . According to a just-released NIDA study , 40 percent of American high-school seniors have used an illicit drug other than marijuana , and some rehab centers are admitting addicts as young as 12 . " The front line in the fight against drugs is the fifth and sixth grades , " declares James P. Comstock , program manager of San Francisco 's adolescent CareUnit . Lee Dogoloff , head of the White House office on drug policy in the Carter administration , agrees . " By adolescence it 's too late , " he warns . " Once the juices start flowing , they ca n't hear you . " Gary , now 18 , did n't hear much of anything after discovering the thrill of marijuana four years ago . " It became a constant struggle to hold onto the feeling , " says the youth , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until " it was like my brain was fried . " At 15 he started dealing . " I 'd walk into the bathroom at school and say Quaaludes , ' and they 'd be gone , " he reports . By his senior year he was shooting drugs ? cocaine , Percodan , anything he could find . It was Gary 's uncle , a counselor at the Ridgeview Institute , who finally interrupted the cycle of disaster . Now drug-free and living in a recovery house , Gary works full time and is thinking of going to college in the fall . " But my main priority , " he asserts , " is just not doing any drugs . " Teen-age abusers face other special problems . For one thing , they often do not have a clear idea of what it feels like to be sober . As a result , the goal of treatment seems less comprehensible . If they do successfully complete a rehab program , they may face relentless peer pressure to take drugs again once they get back to school . Or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the verge of release from the adolescent unit of Washington 's Psychiatric Institute after struggling to kick an amphetamine habit , was horrified to receive an envelope containing two brightly colored capsules of speed ? a " welcome home " present from her dealer . No Cure : For addicts of any age , perhaps the most effective point any program can make is that drug and alcohol abuse , once under way , has no permanent cure . Like diabetes , it can only be arrested or controlled . Cathy 's dealer will always be lurking just around the corner , and every addict knows that getting straight is a piece of cake compared with staying straight . " All AA asks you to do , " observes Ken , a recovering alcoholic , with some awe , " is to change your whole life . " A sobering thought , to be sure .
