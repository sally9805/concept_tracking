A recipe to close the deficit <P> Trying to close the federal budget deficit of nearly $200 billion is a bit like making the perfect spaghetti sauce . There are hundreds of different recipes because individual cooks have their own special tastes . Congressional Democrats want to trim the deficit primarily by reducing military spending and raising taxes , while the White House and many Republicans would prefer to cut social programs . <P> Now the Brookings Institution , a respected Washington research organization , has put forward a bold budget-cutting recipe that will be tasty to no one but may show the way toward a compromise . Published last week , Economic Choices 1984 ( Brookings ; $8.95 ) presents a strategy that combines cuts in military and domestic spending with tax hikes . The 171-page book is the work of a team of ten economists headed by Alice Rivlin , former director of the Congressional Budget Office . <P> Unless Congress takes action , the budget deficit is expected to rise inexorably from $197 billion next year to $308 billion by 1989 . The Brookings proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push it down to only $20 billion by the end of the decade . Carefully balanced , the plan calls for spending reductions of $92 billion , equally divided between defense and domestic cuts , and tax increases of $108 billion in 1989 . Lower interest costs on the national debt would save another $88 billion that year . <P> The Brookings economists offer detailed suggestions for meeting those goals . On the domestic spending side , the book advocates a one-year freeze on all social programs except those intended to help the poor . Beyond that , the proposal calls for long-term spending restraints concentrated in four major areas : Social Security , Medicare , federal pensions and farm benefits . The economists suggest , for example , that the initial level of Social Security benefits that people receive when they retire could be reduced by 5% . In addition , the book asserts that the rate of growth in payments that hospitals receive for each Medicare patient should be slashed by more than two-thirds , after adjustment for inflation . For all domestic programs , the target would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argues that many of the proposed weapons systems in the Reagan military buildup are redundant . The Pentagon does not need the land-based MX missile , say the Brookings experts , when it also plans to have the submarine-based Trident D-5 aimed at Soviet targets . Also high on the hit list are the B-1B bomber , the AH-64 attack helicopter and the F-15 fighter . By Brookings estimates , the Government could carve $46 billion out of the defense budget by 1989 without threatening national security at all . <P> Even with big spending cuts , however , revenue increases will be needed . The Brookings economists think Congress should aim to boost taxes by $23 billion in 1985 . Much of that could come from eliminating many income tax deductions and closing loopholes . Congress could , for example , raise $3.9 billion by taxing employees on employer contributions to health plans and $600 million by reducing business entertainment deductions by 50% . The Brookings book lists 23 such-steps that could bring in $30 billion , but suggests that a politically realistic target might be $15 billion . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal could be raised by imposing a temporary 2% income tax surcharge.
