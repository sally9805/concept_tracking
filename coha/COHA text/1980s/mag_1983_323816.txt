New Persian Gulf equation ? <P> For the past three years , Iraq and Iran have been like scorpions in a bottle , stuck in a war that seemingly has no end . Well over 100,000 from both sides have been killed ; thousands more have been taken prisoners . Now , a new element may enter the grim struggle , possibly altering its scope and stakes : according to French press reports , neither confirmed nor denied by the authorities over the weekend , the French government is sending to Iraq five highly sophisticated Super Etendard fighter-bombers . The planes , flown by French pilots , were said to have taken off from Landivisiau air base in Brittany , bound for southern France or Corsica prior to being handed over to Iraq . <P> Iraq has already received from France 20 Exocet air-to-surface missiles , the same weapon that the Argentines used to such deadly effect against the British in the Falklands war last year . Once the Super Etendards are equipped with the Exocets , the Iraqis would have a weapons system capable of hitting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million bbl. per day of crude . <P> The Iranian government has warned that if its oil installations are threatened in any way , it will shut down ship traffic in the gulf by bottling up the entrance at the Strait of Hormuz . Such a move would seriously disrupt the lifeline of gulf oil , most notably from Saudi Arabia , to the rest of the world . About 50% of Japan 's oil imports , nearly 40% of Western Europe 's and 10% of the U.S. 's come from the region . <P> In past weeks , officials from the U.S. , Britain , West Germany and several gulf nations have expressed their misgivings to the government of President Francois Mitterrand about the jet delivery . Paris did hold up the transfer for three weeks , partly because the government did not want the news to come out before Mitterrand 's speech on nuclear disarmament at the United Nations late last month . But French officials have also argued that the Super Etendards might , in fact , persuade the Iranians to pursue a negotiated settlement-to which Iraq is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , less noble reason : Iraq owes France between $5 billion and $7 billion for previous arms deliveries . If Baghdad loses the war , Paris has little hope of collecting .
