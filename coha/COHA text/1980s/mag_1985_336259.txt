A Saturday afternoon three days before Christmas . A dingy , noisy subway train rolls under Greenwich Village and approaches the World Trade Center . Five shots ring out in eight seconds . Four black youths lie wounded . Bernhard Goetz becomes a legend . <P> Amid an outpouring of praise for the man who refused to be mugged , Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau takes the case to a grand jury . The panel of 23 New Yorkers indicts Goetz only for illegal possession of handguns . Much of the city applauds . So does much of the nation . A Media General-Associated Press poll discloses that 47% of Americans approve of what Goetz did , 36% prudently say that they do not know enough of the details to form a judgment , and only 17% feel that Goetz was wrong in shooting the teenagers . <P> But soon second thoughts set in . The youths had asked Goetz for $5 , but were they really about to harm him ? Two carried screwdrivers , but two were not armed . Why did Goetz , by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You seem to be doing all right . Here 's another , " and then fire a shot that may have crippled the youth for life ? And if Goetz was a shy , retiring person as he claimed , why was he parading around town with reporters , making pronouncements on the need for law-and-order ? <P> As public support for Goetz wavers , Morgenthau resubmits the case to a second grand jury . After deliberating last week , this grand jury throws the book at Goetz , charging him with four counts of attempted murder , four counts of assault , one count of reckless endangerment of other passengers in the subway car and one count of criminal possession of a weapon . <P> The story of Bernhard Goetz had taken an unexpected turn , but it still hit the same raw nerve in the American psyche . Despite his personal peculiarities ( see following story ) , Goetz was to some extent an Everyman : even people who deplored what he did felt they could understand why he did it . " I was acting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper story . That fear is shared by millions of Americans whose pulses quicken at the sound of footsteps following on dark city sidewalks , who cross to the opposite side of the street when young toughs loiter ahead , who endure the impersonal intimacy of jammed buses and nervously eye what Columbia Criminologist Peter Read calls " the familiar stranger . " <P> Fear . Many experts contend that it has always exceeded the actual danger posed by street criminals bent on violence . But there is no question that fear of crime is a dominant fact of urban life and a growing blight on suburbia as well . A new report by the Eisenhower Foundation , a group of academics who study crime , found that " the level of fear of crime remains at least as high " in the U.S. as in one of the worst previous periods , the 1960s . Atlanta Psychiatrist Alfred Messer , who calls the 1980s " the decade of the criminal , " argues that the prevalence of violent crime makes people feel " helpless . " He contends that Goetz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught not to do . He is seen as striking a blow for all of us. "
