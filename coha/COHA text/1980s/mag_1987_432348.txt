 | It 's not exactly a shopping mall , but the Arbat is a Moscow street closed to traffic and open to just hanging out . Street artists have recently been allowed to go into business for themselves ; free-lance poets and musicians draw small crowds . The scene is tame by American standards , but strollers may happen upon Soviet hippies with shoulder-length hair , Soviet break-dancers or Soviet punks with leather , chains and some Western cultural artifact , perhaps a crushed can of Heineken beer attached to a string around the neck . Among them is Aleksandr , 18 , a graphic artist . He and three friends each show the scars on their wrists , which they slit in order to avoid Army service . Such behavior lands young men in hospitals for psychiatric evaluations of anywhere from two weeks to several months , but for them it beats going to Afghanistan . " The middle class looks at us and says we 're crap , we 're homosexuals , " splutters Aleksandr , whose tastes among Western writers run to J. D. Salinger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What I really am , " he says with a jaded smile , " is a neoromantic , postindustrial , decadent nihilist . " Aleksandr 's physical and verbal lacerations are n't typical of Soviet youth , but his alienation just might be . There are thousands ? probably millions ? of kids who have no faith in the system , no matter who is running it . The fear , now widely expressed , is that these kids could sap hopes for social and economic revival . @# Yet they are rebels without much of a cause . In fact , there are signs that many of the Western fads and other expressions of youthful rebellion may be apolitical at bottom . That would help explain Mikhail Gorbachev 's tolerance for them . The general secretary has gone out of his way , for instance , to ensure the widest possible viewing this year of a sympathetic film about troubled youth ( a suicidal girl , a Hare Khrishna disciple , a rowdy punk-rock fan , among others ) called " Is It Easy To Be Young ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the point seems to be that the antidote to alienation is simple compassion . Instead of resenting these kids , the film suggests , parents should just try to realize how hard it is to grow up . Bowie haircut : The accouterments of Western culture can be deceptive . Beneath them often lies plain communist conformity . Vladimir is a 20-year-old electronics specialist with a David Bowie haircut and a sweat shirt lettered " Regular Season New York . " At a concert by Aquarium , a Leningrad band recently allowed to cut its first official album , Vladimir finds no contradiction between NEWSWEEK : DECEMBER 14 , 1987 39  | his favorite group 's irreverence and his own orthodox political views . " The government is the people , so it 's not possible for the government to be wrong , " he says . Sergei , a 16-year-old working-class kid who says he recently gave up listening to Iron Maiden in favor of Talking Heads , admires lyrics from the Soviet group Alisa that go : " My generation looks into the world , my generation feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of political content . He is defensive when a foreigner asks about his country 's food shortages . " You can wait in line for 15 minutes and get anything you want , " he says untruthfully . Andrei Budin , a 17-year-old technical student from the Ural Mountains , adores Soviet hard-rock groups like Galaxy and Black Coffee . But he echoes the crudest propaganda : " The arms race is exclusively the fault of the United States . If they stopped , so would we . " Outside a cemetery in Moscow , Aleksandr P. , a 22-year-old student of agricultural technology wearing black-market blue jeans , divides Soviet youth into essentially three groups . " There are the jerks ? about 60 to 70 percent ? who may listen to rock music but know little and care less . They believe everything they 're told . Hippies , punks and other nonconformists make up another 10 percent or so . The rest are normal kids who think and are worried . " Aleksandr is a veteran of Afghanistan . He saw no combat but watched as a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime that was covered up . It changed him . " I admire Gorbachev . I think he 's smart and honest and will achieve more than the usual . But all of them leaders always run up against a big rock , and everything eventually returns to what it was . " Change is only possible , he says , if the bureaucracy is cut tenfold , which he knows wo n't happen . Negro carnival ' : Aleksandr and his friends have little use for the Komsomol , the hidebound official Communist Party youth group that every student is pressured to join . Neither do millions of other young people , who remain unideological and do n't participate in party affairs . In response , the Komsomol occasionally shows a grudging flexibility . A group of Latvian youths , for instance , has established an avant-garde " Underground Club " with the Komsomol 's backing . The converted wine cellar has a seancelike atmosphere : candles , dripping water , pictures of skulls and abstract art , graffiti reading " Atom Free Zone . " There 's no alcohol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of surveillance . But the @# members have their own informal concerts and avant-garde fashion shows , staged on a crude wooden runway . " Punk carnival " went well ; " Negro carnival " was less successful . Dressing up presented problems because no one had actually met a black person before . Even working-class kids , however , seem to know more about American culture and history than American kids know about the Soviet Union . Vladimir Ulyabko , a 17-year-old studying to be an auto-industry locksmith , says of American politics : " We liked Roosevelt and Kennedy better than Reagan . " How many 17-year-old American vocationalschool students would be able even to identify Khrushchev and Stalin , much less evaluate them ? Partly because their own history is so censored , the thirst for knowledge about Western Europe and the United States is nearly insatiable . Children of the elite , of course , are best able to slake that thirst . Finding a John Updike novel is easier with connections . Tape recorders and blank tapes , which have now spread Western music across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the privileged . The new status symbol ? available only to wealthy black marketeers or higherranking professionals ? is the VCR . All eight students in a journalism class at elite Moscow State University claimed to have seen " Rambo , " and several talked intelligently about the American directors Brian de Palma and Sydney Pollack . An administrator at a factory social center in Latvia enjoyed " Police Academy . " Ayoungbureaucratin awell-tailored suit has even grown a bit blase about his VCR . " I have a fuzzbuster ' too , " he boasts . Kit Carson : All of that can have the effect of stripping Soviet stereotypes of their crudeness . Aleksandr Surayev , a thirdyear American-history student at Moscow University , traces his changing view of the United States : " I read Krokodil magazine a satirical weekly as a child and I remember a cartoon in which an American cop looks at a street full of corpses of cops shot by gangsters . My mother was going to the United States , and I said , Mother , do n't go . You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I began reading about the American West and Kit Carson , and I had a more positive stereotype . " Now he reads Arthur Schlesinger Jr . and John Irving . A retreat from glasnost could make it harder to transform those stereotypes . But shutting out the surrounding world would be harder this time . At least some elements of Western culture are now deeply entrenched in the lives of millions of young people . That may be encouraging on its own terms . It should not , however , be viewed as the seeding of a new society . While the avant-garde group Televisor sings a song with the lyrics " Get out of control , " it 's unlikely that Soviet kids ever really will . @#
