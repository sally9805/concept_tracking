The challenges have led to plans to reopen hundreds of cases involving convictions based on the results of Breathalyzer tests . The test , used in most drunken-driving prosecutions , measures the alcohol content in a person ' s breath and then converts the measurement to an equivalent reading of alcohol content in the blood. // Law-enforcement officials say the challenges have so far been limited to Breathalyzer tests that used two batches of a chemical solution produced by a Pennsylvania company , Systems Innovation Inc . The batches were distributed in New York beginning in 1986 and have been used throughout the state for three years . No other states appear to have received the questionable solution. // // Denial by Manufacturer // Defense lawyers have argued that the solution sent to New York was made improperly , rendering its measurements unreliable . But the manufacturer has denied this , saying all its solutions are made according to scientific standards. // One challenge to the breath test has apparently been the basis of a jury acquittal in the Bronx . In a Brooklyn case a judge has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Innovation ' s solutions were inadmissible as evidence . And in Manhattan the district attorney ' s office has decided to hold back prosecutions that rely on the same evidence. // " There is no question about our moving to reopen hundreds of cases in which there have been convictions based on tests results that relied on the questionable chemical solutions , " said Ivar Goldart , head of the Legal Aid Society ' s criminal defense division. // The defense attacks do not challenge the Breathalyzer machine ; courts throughout the country have recognized its reliability for at least 35 years. // Rather the challenges center on a particular chemical solution used in the machine to measure whether a drunken-driving suspect has an alcohol level that exceeds the legal limit of 0. 10 . Defense lawyers say the tests are erring by at least 0. 03 in most cases . <> <> Manhattan Prosecutions Foiled // Paul Shechtman , the Manhattan assistant district attorney in charge of drunken-driving prosecutions , said , " Breathalyzer tests are being crippled in New York City because the company that produces a chemical product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or maintain detailed lot-number records , like drug companies are required to do. " // Mr. Schectman said 70 to 80 current drunken-driving prosecutions in Manhattan " are in jeopardy because of presumably tainted evidence. " // Moreover , he said he had ordered Manhattan prosecutors to hold off new prosecutions unless the Breathalyzer tests show an alcohol level of 0. 13 or unless there is substantial corroborative evidence of intoxication. // All told , officials said , approximately 250 , 000 units of the disputed Breathalyzer solution - enough for 125 , 000 tests - were purchased by law-enforcement agencies and police departments in New York State from Systems Innovation Inc. of Hallstead , Pa. , and put into use beginning in 1986 . The solution is presumed to have been used as evidence in drunken-driving prosecutions since then . It is not known how many drunken-driving prosecutions outside New York City have been challenged because of doubts about the Breathalyzer test . <> <> A Chance for ' the Rich ' // Mr. Goldart said defendants who could afford costly expert witnesses could seek to have the tests thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests that used the solution. // " But the real atrocity here is that while the rich can buy an acquittal , poor people will be convicted and remain convicted , " he said. // Peter Gerstenzang , an Albany lawyer and a national expert on drunken-driving laws , said , however , that he doubted whether many people who had been convicted as a result of breath tests that used the Systems Innovation chemical solution would seek retrials. // He said that because a vast majority of the convictions involved plea bargains , many defendants could not bear the high cost of another trial or risk having drunken-driving charges against them restored. // Debate over the Breathalyzer tests grew after a Bronx jury in Criminal Court , on Aug. 4 , apparently accepted defense arguments challenging the test ' s reliability and acquitted Carlton Coach , a 28-year-old security guard in the borough , of driving while intoxicated. // A defense witness , Gordon Whitney , a former manufacturing worker for Systems Innovation , had testified that a key chemical solution used in the Breathalyzer machine in the case had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the quality control measures normally required in such manufacturing had not been applied when the chemical solution used in the machine was made . <> <> Evidence Barred by Judge // Lawyers with the Legal Aid Society , which provided Mr. Coach ' s defense , said the acquittal was the first in New York State based on a challenge of solutions used in a Breathalyzer machine. // Similarly , in a decision on Feb. 24 , in Criminal Court in Brooklyn , Judge Joseph Kevin McCay ruled that the evidence of a Breathalyzer test that used the same chemical solution was inadmissible in a drunken-driving prosecution because of questionable production practices by the company. // And in Manhattan , Judge Marcy L. Kahn is expected to rule in Criminal Court this week on whether to throw out evidence based on a Breathalyzer test in a drunken-driving prosecution . Defense lawyers have challenged the test ' s reliability by using the testimony of Leroy Campbell , another former Systems Innovation employee. // Systems Innovation has a contract with the New York State Police Crime Laboratory and most police departments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Breathalyzer machines. // Mark Dale , an assistant director of the state laboratory , said " we have had no problem " with the solutions purchased from Systems Innovation , " even though they have caused a lot of perceived problems in court . " <> <> Chemical Reaction at Stake // The solution has three key components - sulphuric acid , potassium dichromate and silver nitrate - enclosed in three-milliliter containers called ampules . A chemical reaction occurs when the ampule ' s seal is broken and the solution is exposed to a person ' s breath . The exposed solution is then measured against an identical but sealed ampule that is also placed in the machine . From that , the Breathalyzer machine determines the breath ' s alcohol content. // The machine then converts the breath-alcohol reading to an equivalent blood-alcohol reading. // As part of each test , a separate solution with an exact alcohol level of 0. 10 is fed into the machine to insure that the machine is recording accurate breath alcohol levels. // Any reading of 0. 10 or more is evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of up to one year on first conviction . A subsequent charge is a felony with a penalty of up to four years . <> <> Quality Control Challenged // Maurice Dutton , vice president of Systems Innovation , said his company ' s production methods met all scientific standards . He said a 1987 report by the Pennsylvania Auditor General was the primary source of the courtroom challenges to his company ' s products . The audit was highly critical of Systems Innovation , contending that its production methods lacked scientific quality control. // But a year later a report by the Pennsylvania Attorney General repudiated the auditor ' s report as " erroneous and misleading . " The Attorney General ' s report concluded that " there is no reason to believe that the solutions provided by Systems Innovation Inc. are defective , " and it blamed the audit for " spawning a lack of confidence with respect to the accuracy of alcohol breath-test devices.
