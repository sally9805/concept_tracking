Nobody knows where and when the weddingtook place . Imagine the sensation if I could find a written report ! I mean , Morandini could have been their best man , or one of the witnesses . " " It looks to me like the proverbial needle in the haystack . You 'll have to investigate every box and crate in the villa . " " Right . " The prospect did not appear to daunt David . He beamed radiantly . " Maybe you ought to give up literature and go in for garbagecollecting , " I suggested . " It pays better than scholarship , " was the bland reply .

I 've only been here a couple of weeks , and already I 've found a crate of odds and ends one of the Morandinis collected in Egypt in the 1880 's . Most of them are forgeries , but there are a few genuine pieces . I would n't be surprised to run across a mummy tucked away in a cor-ner . " The delight in his voice made me laugh .

You can obviously talk the leg off a donkey , but I ca n't see Francesca giving a damn about Margaret Fuller . Especially Margaret Fuller . " " Oh , that . Well , to be honest with you . . . " David took off his glasses and looked grave . " I got carried away talking to you . It must be your kind , innocent face . You wo n't split on me , will you ?

As you may have observed from the neglected state of the house and grounds and the paucity of staff , the lady 's cash flow is none too good . The same thing is true of many of the old families , except the smart ones who have turned to manufacturing cars or clothes . They 've already hocked the paintings and the antique furniture and the sculpture . Until I pointed it out , they did n't realize there might be unconsidered gems in the attic . The guy whose ancestor brought back the Aztec mask is a friend of the contessa . An American museum has offered a sum for the mask that dazzleshis simple aristocratic soul . Your lady friend thinks I may find something like that here . " " Will you ? " " It 's damned unlikely . But one never knows . " His eyes rested gloatingly on the heaped-up boxes . I stood up . " I can see you 're dying to get back to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not that way . " He put out a casual hand to detain me as I turned toward the narrow opening through which I had come . " I do n't know how you ever made it through all that stuff . I 'll show you my door . " " I do n't want to take you from your labor of love . " " It 's time for my morning break anyway . " He untangled his long legs and got to his feet . " A quick run around the garden , followed by a call on the cook . Come on . " The way out was certainly less complicated than the route I had followed coming in . Uncarpeted stairs and straight passagesled down four flights . The last stairs ended in a brickflooredcorridor whose walls were of peeling stucco . " Kitchen is that way , " David said , lifting a thumb toward the right . " Pantries and storerooms on the other side . All unoccupied now . And this ... " He opened a door . " This is my exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rank with weeds.  |p73A  path had been beaten through the weeds around the walls , presumably by David 's feet . A few tangled roses struggled out of the brush to cling to the broken bricks and a half-rotted wooden bench stood against one wall . That was the extent of the amenities . " ' Run ' would be more like it , " I said . " You mean this is the only part of the grounds you 're allowed to use during the daytime ? " " Now , now , do n't let your democratic indignation get the better of you . I 'm here on sufferance , and I take what I can get . It is n't so bad ; my room is over the garage , which is through that gate . I can go and come as I please . Anyhow , I 'm not anxious to socialize with the gentry or the staff  --  especially Alberto . " His dust-streaked face was grim .

" You can get into the house that way , or go around to the front door . " " Thanks . And thanks for the lecture . " " Any time . " His wide smile illumined his face . " If you get bored , come up and help me rummage . " " I might at that . If you get tired of running around this this outdoor cage  --  come and play football with me and Pete . " " Pete ? " " I should say Pietro ; the contessa does n't care for American nicknames . Actually he 's the Count Morandini , but it sounds silly to call a ten-year-old boy by his title . " " You mean there 's a kid living here ? A ten-year-old ? " " Have n't you seen him ? " David shook his head.  |p74I  LEFT David doggedly jogging around the path . Four circuits made up half a mile ; he 'd paced it off with a pedometer . Seeing him in daylight , I realized how distant was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything like Bart . They were about the same height and build ; that had been enough to deceive me . Even when dusted , David 's brown hair was several shades lighter than Bart 's ; he moved without Bart 's smooth actor 's grace . Running , he looked like a loosejointed , long-limbed marionette , a Petrouchka puppet with a cheerful clown 's face . He should have had freckles . Maybe there were freckles , under the dust . Even if it had been clean , his was not the kind of face women looked at , the bolder staring openly , the well-bred sneaking little sidelong glances . Women did that to Bart . I remembered the smug satisfaction with which I had clung to his arm , watching other women yearn for what was mine . I made my way to the walled garden where I had found Pete playing . It was quiet and deserted . There was no sign that a child had ever been there  --  no forgotten balls or toys lying in the long grass , no swing or trapeze hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise at the mention of a child had left me with a queer feeling . He kept to his own part of the house and grounds , of course . He was in the attic most of the day . Still , it bothered me to think that the boy was so invisible . Maybe he was away at school . Maybe he had been home for vacation the day I saw him , or he attended a boarding school during the week and was only at the villa on weekends . I decided I might as well do a little exploring . As Francesca had indicated , I was dressed for it , and I could n't get any dirtier after my visit to the attic . Besides , I wantedp75to find out where the garage was located so I could get my car without having to apply to Alberto . I must remember to retrieve my keys , too . I went back to David 's exercise yard . He had finished his jogging and gone , presumably to beg a snack from Rosa . Through the gate he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old stables on the far side . They were part of the house itself , the lower level of a wing that extended away from the central block . The former coachhouse had been turned into a garage . Beyond it , rows of empty stalls stretched forlornly to the far end of the wing . I did n't go through the gate . The Mercedes was out in the yard , and Alberto was polishing it . Sunlight reflected dazzlinglyfrom the gleaming chrome of the grille . Too bad he was n't as conscientious about the dog . I wondered where the animal was kept . It must be nearby , in the work area . I decided it might be a good idea to find out so I would n't inadvertently wander into its run . The formalintroduction had n't convinced me of its good intentions . The obvious course would have been to ask Alberto . InsteadI backed quietly away from the gate and began looking on my own . It did n't take me long . I smelled the place before I saw it  --  not far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to the route Pete followed to reach his bleak playground . The dog 's pen was worse than bleak , it was a disgrace . There was a kennel of sorts , tin-roofed and obviously not leak-proof . Though the walls of the pen were ten feet high , the dog was chained . A narrow stretch of beaten earth , liberally sprinkled with piles of dung , marked the limits of its restless pacing . It was n't pacing now ; it lay stretched out , head on paws , next to a cheap plastic bowl containing a scant half-inch of scummy water . He looked so bored and pathetic I almost did something really stupid . When I touched the gate he started up . The wind must have been blowing the wrong way , for he hadp76not caught my scent . Did he jump with joy at the sight of me , the only person in his life who defended him and spoke gently to him ? He jumped , all right  --  straight at me , jaws gaping . The chain brought him up with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have a rotten memory , " I said . " Calm down . You 're not supposed to eat me ; I 'm one of the gentry , remember ? " I talked to him awhile , till he stopped snarling and sat down , staring at me like someone trying to remember a face . As I walked away I was so angry I was shaking . It was only sensible to keep the dog chained ; he could probably jump the gate with no trouble . But the chain was far too short and Alberto did n't even bother keeping the pen clean . I wondered how often the dog was fed . From the way he had drooled at me , I deduced it was n't often enough . I returned to the kitchen garden and went through another gate . I had never seen a place so walled off into little compartments . Once the gardens must have been gorgeous . Even now , after years of neglect , there were signs of the features that had given each enclosure its special character  --  beds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcing brave emerald spears through the weeds in another ; a crumbling fountain set in a mosaic-lined grotto in another . The bits of glittering mica and colored stone had been laid in concrete , but the roots of climbing vines had inserted steely fingers , and piles of fallen color littered the fountain 's floor . One garden had been walled with marble and adorned with a tiny circular columned temple that must have served as a gazebo . Two of the columns had fallen ; I realized that they had been built that way , one of the artificial ruins popular with **27;13020;TOOLONG artists . And everywhere the untendedgrass and the weeds were growing , to smother flowers and crack stone . A final gate of intricate but rusted wrought iron admittedp77me to the front grounds . They had been splendid in their heyday ; the fountain spouting crystal streams from all the Tritons ' horns , the lawn like emerald velvet , the flower beds patches of bright color . A stooped figure bent over one of the beds . It must be the man Francesca had mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't appear to be working very hard . I hesitated , wondering whether to approach him . There was n't much I could say except " Buon giorno , " nor much I could do except smile . He might not care for my condescending attentions . As I watched he got painfully to his feet , and I realized , with a shock of pity , that the poor creature was physically handicapped . Limping , one shoulder higher than the other , he set off across the lawn away from me . It was later than I had realized . A glance at my watch confirmed the time suggested by the height of the sun . I would have to shower and change . And , I promised myself , I would ask Francesca where she was hiding her grandson . She could exile the child from her presence if she chose , but there was no reason why I had to treat him like a leper . However , when I came down to lunch , suitably attired in blouse and skirt , Francesca was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ; when I indicated to her that I would wait for my hostess she produced a note from her pocket . The delicate handwriting informed me that I would be lunching alone . Francesca had an appointment she could not cancel . " I meant to tell you this morning at breakfast , " she wrote . " I hope you will excuse my rudeness . " I could hardly blame her for forgetting , after the exhibition I had put on . I waited until Emilia had poured my coffee before I asked about Pete . I called him Pietro , of course . She repeated the key word . " School ? " " La scuola . Is it conte at the scuola today ? "  |p78She  shook her head . " Why not ? " She looked blankly at me . I tried again . " Where is he ? " Her shoulders lifted in a shrug . I suspected she would not have committed that vulgarity in Francesca 's presence , but vulgarity does n't bother me ; what bothered me was the utter indifference the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ? " I asked . Another shrug . " In his room ? " I tossed my napkin onto the table with a gesture worthy of a contessa . " Where is his room ? " You 'd have thought I had asked the way to the lion house . She did n't try to prevent me or talk me out of it , she simply could not comprehend why I would voluntarily look for the boy . We started up the stairs . I decided I might as well take advantage of the opportunity to find out the answers to some of the things I was curious about , so I peppered her with questions . Yes , she said , the contessa 's room was also on the second floor , at the far end of the same corridor on which my room was located , and near the door into the west wing , which was now unoccupied . Emilia 's fractured English becamesurprisingly fluent at this point , and she went on to explain that the west wing was in a ruinous condition  --  unsafe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing I had seen her come with her covered tray . I was tempted to ask if that was where they keep crazy old Uncle Giovanni , but I decided Emilia 's English was n't good enough for jokes . It was not a very funny joke anyway . My room was n't the state bedchamber after all . The suite of the reigning count and his consort occupied the entire second-floor front of the villa . But the present count was elsewhere . I had taken it for granted that the child 's room would be on the same floor asp79the other bedchambers ; however , after I had stopped in my room to pick up the game I 'd bought for him , Emilia led me up again . So Pete was in the attic , with the servants and the other junk . I was familiar with the old-fashioned custom of keeping the young as far from the adults as possible , but in this case it struck me as profoundly mistaken , not to say dangerous . That was when it dawned on me that Francesca had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , then , especially at night ? When we reached the head of the stairs Emilia turned in the opposite direction from the one we had taken to reach the storeroom where David was working . Pete 's room was on a corridor paralleling the front of the house . It was not far from the stairs , but it was a long way from Francesca'sroom , which was at the far end of another corridor on the floor below . She would n't be able to hear him if he became ill during the night  --  and that was probably just the way she wanted it . I asked Emilia where she slept . She gestured  --  near Francesca'sroom . " And the tuttofare ? " I persisted . This time her pointing finger indicated a door not far from the boy 's . She added , with a twisted smile , " When she is there . She sleeps away , very often . " I did n't ask any more questions . When I raised my hand to knock on Pete 's door , Emilia reached for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not thought anything about it . The proper place for a key is in a keyhole . She said , " You wish to go in ? " Not trusting myself to speak , I nodded . Emilia turned the key . " When you come out , you ... " She gestured , twisting her fingers . Lock him in again when you come out . I stared at her . She shrugged , smiling insolently . " Bene , signora . As you desire . " I waited till she was out of sight . I thought I had heardp80sounds of movement inside  --  soft , scuttling , surreptitious movements , like rats in the wall . Then I knocked and called out . " It 's me , Pete . Kathy . Can I come in ? " After a moment his voice said , " Please . " The room had been furnished as a nursery , thirty years ago . It may have been pleasant then ; there were shelves filled with toys and books , a fireplace with a fender and screen , a rocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong with it now , except for its shabbiness and the fact that there was not one object in it that could have amused a ten-yearoldboy . The window was barred . Pete was in bed , a book open on his lap . He sat quite still , his eyes wide and watchful , his lips tight , until I closed the door . " They did n't tell me you were sick , " I said . " I 'd have come to see you before if I had known . " " You are alone , signora ? " " Yes . " I pulled up a chair and sat down . " How do you feel ? " " Well . I am well . I am not sick . " " I was afraid you had caught something from me . I guess it was n't catching , though . " The funniest expression spread over his face  --  sly , almost prurient . It was a horrid look , even worse than the shuttered wariness it had replaced . I had not missed the significance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me " signorina " before . Someone must have told him part of the story and hinted at the rest . I said impulsively , " You know I was married to your . . . he 'd be your cousin , would n't he ? " " Yes , signora . " " I 'm not pregnant , though . " The sly little leer vanished in a flood of surprise . He knew the word ; after all , he had spent some time in an American school , and there are n't many words those kids have n't heard.  |p81I  went on casually , " You know , when a woman is going to have a baby , sometimes she gets sick at her stomach . I was sick yesterday . It was just one of those bugs people get when they travel . But I 'm afraid someone may have jumped to the wrong conclusion . " I do n't think he understood the last word , but the idea got through . His brow furrowed . " You are not  --  you do not ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was ? " He was still flushed , but his expression was one of normal childish curiosity . He dropped the book and hugged his knees . " I heard them talk  --  Emilia and Rosa . When Emilia saw I was listening she said I was bad . It was not a thing for chil-dren .... " " Never mind , I can imagine what she said . She was wrong on all counts . " I smiled at him . " In a way I 'm sorry I 'm not pregnant . I 'd like to have a child . " " You like children ? " " Yes , of course . That 's what I do for a living  --  teach chil-dren . " " Like me ? " " A little bit older than you . Junior high school . My students are between twelve and fifteen . " " What do you teach ? " " History . " His face fell . " Not football . " " You know I 'm not very good at football , Pete . Oh , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounced on the game like a starving man on a bowl of soup . " I had it  --  like this  --  before . But it was not so  --  so  --  " " Complicated ? " He tasted the word experimentally . " Complicated ... Yes : Not so complicated . It was broken . Let us play this now . " It did n't take him long to get the hang of it . I had alreadyp82accepted the humiliating fact that most of my students could beat the pants off me at any electronic game . He skinned me four games out of six , and he would have gone on playing all day if I had n't begged off . " Let 's play something else . Darn it , I 'd like to win for a change . " " There is nothing else . " " No games  --  Parcheesi , checkers ? " " Only baby games . " He swept the room with a scornful wave of his hand . " What do you do all day ? " I tried to keep my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have a radio . Sometimes I listen to the music . And I am always to study . " He indicated the book he had ( not ) been reading . It was a thick volume on Italian history , written for adults . There were a few black-and-white photographs . I could n't continue the inquisition . I had completely lost my sense of perspective , and that was bad . I had only heard one side of the case . It was hard to imagine there could be another valid point of view , but I had learned through painful experience that one could easily go astray in one 's judgments , especially where a child was concerned . His face changed pitifully when I rose to go , but he did n't ask me to stay . " Maybe you can get up tomorrow , " I said . " We might have a game of real football . " " I can get up now . I am not sick . " I felt his forehead . " You have n't got a fever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , then moved away . " I am not sick . They say I have to rest , but I do n't . Only ... only sometimes ... I have bad dreams . " He must have seen from my expression how that hit me . Not only my own nightmares , but the memory of a voice , smooth and trained : " I could be bounded in a nutshell , And count myself a king of ultimate space , Were it not that I havep83had dreams .... " Bart had always wanted to play Hamlet . What actor does n't ? And what a gorgeous Prince of Denmark he 'd have made in the classic black velvet doublet and tights , with his shock of dark hair and his silver eyes , his high cheekbonesand flexible hands . A small voice stammered , " I said something bad . " " No . No , you did n't . " I reached out for him and pulled him close . I needed the warmth , the closeness , as much as he did . " I have bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be . But someday they 'll go away . When you lose someone you . . . you love , at first all you can feel is anger . But it will pass . The hate and the hurt and the bad dreams , all of it . " As I stumbled through that little speech I knew that Doc Baldwin would have howled with horror at my uneducated attempt at therapy . How dare I meddle with something as deep-rooted and deadly as this child 's sense of loss ? Was I naive enough to suppose that my ignorant efforts could help ? Yes , I was . And I think they did help . He was n't ready to let go and cry , but he held me tightly for a few seconds . Then he remembered his age and his dignity and pulled away . " It was bad for you , signora ? I am sorry . " " Not as bad as it was for you . " I brushed the tumbledhair from his forehead . " I think you are a very brave person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk , in a queer mixture of English and Italian . I got a picture of a way of life totally alien to me  --  a life-style I thought of as " jetset " or " beautiful people , " for his parents seemed to have traveled constantly , to all the fashionable places . Either there was more money in the family than I supposed , or Mama and Papa had known how to make the most of their income , for Pete made casual mention of maids and tutors and teachers and other luxuries . He had not been left to the care of servants , though . His father had taught him to swim and ski . Hisp84mother had taken him to playgrounds and carnivals and zoos . She loved carousels . " Always she rode a white horse . When I was little she took me on the white horse with her . When I was big , I rode another horse , or a lion , or an elephant . " And he had had a dog . Bruno . His eyes filled when he spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seeing his distress I braced myself for the worst ; but Bruno had not met a sticky end , he had been left behind when Pete came to Italy . " Maybe you can have another dog , " I said , knowing how I would have reacted to that idea if I had been in his shoes . " I do n't want a dog except Bruno . And besides , she would not let me have an animal . Not even a bird . " I knew who she was . When the spate of reminiscences finally ran down he looked limp and exhausted . I knew how he felt ; I had been in that state a few times myself . But he did n't look ill . Too thin and too pale , but that was grieving and lack of exercise  --  mental and physical . Again I prepared to take my leave . " Tomorrow we 'll have that game , " I said . " I 'll ask your grandmother tonight . " " O-kay , " he said , brightening . I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , Signora Kathy ? " " I 'm not going to lock the door . Will you stay in your room ? " He thought about it . " If I do not , they will be angry at you ? " I laughed . " Probably . " " Then I will stay . On the word of a Morandini , I swear ! " He sat upright , his eyes flashing . He looked like Bart . Horribly , dreadfully like him . I forced a smile . " See you tomorrow , Pete . Sleep well  --  and no bad dreams , right ? " " Right ! And you , signora . "  |p85I  went to my room . After ten minutes or so I stopped pacing and sat down and gave myself the lecture Pa would have given me . " Damnation if you 're not at it again , rushing in to rescue people who may not need rescuing and may not want to be rescued . You remind me of the Boy Scout dragging the little old lady across the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't want to cross the damn street ! Will you never learn to find out the facts before you act ? " I did n't think I would ever learn . Pa never had . But Dr. Baldwin and all the other specialists with whom I had worked , at school , would have said the same . Butt out . You may do more harm than good . Stop jumping to conclusions , creating imaginary dramas out of nothing . The boy had not been physically abused . I had seen that a few times , and the signs are unmistakable . Anyway , I could n't imagine Francesca being guilty of that kind of brutality . Her sins would be those of omission and coldness . I tried to see it from her point of view . She too had known grief . She had lost an only son . And into her quiet , ordered life had been thrust a child who was resentful and angry , confused and disturbed . Perhaps she had tried to reach out to him and had been rebuffed . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . Her methodsof dealing with the boy were hopelessly wrong-headed , but they were probably well intentioned . I put on my brown suit when I dressed for dinner . At least it was dignified , and I knew the importance of personal appearancewhen you are planning to start a fight . I meant to get some plain answers to some plain questions . I would try to keep an open mind , but .. . She foiled me again . When I sailed into the ivory-and-gold sitting room , there were guests . They were a middle-aged couple , Dr. and Mrs. Condotti . He looked like a baby pig , all pink and plump . Wisps ofp86graying hair were brushed carefully across his high forehead . His wife was as thin as he was chubby , with a head of shimmeringblond hair that looked like a carved wig . I had learned that Italians were apt to toss titles like " doctor " and " professor " around rather casually . Dr. Condotti might not have been a medical man . But I thought he was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of middle-aged female curiosity . The doctor 's look had a decidedlyprofessional gleam . They were a very dull pair . Only Francesca 's smooth hostessmanners kept conversation from limping through a long formal meal . Mercifully the Condottis left early . As soon as the door closed behind them , Francesca leaned back in her chair with a sigh . A less inhibited woman would have kicked off her shoes , run her hands through her hair , and let out a loud " Whew ! " " I hope you were n't too bored , " she said . " The Condottis speak English well , that is why I invited them . They are not intellectuals , however . " " Not at all , " I said vaguely . " I must also apologize for leaving you alone all day . Perhapstomorrow I can show you something of the countryside . " That gave me my opening . " I promised Pete  --  Pietro  --  I would spend part of the day with him . " She knew I had visited him . There was no surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You did not lock his door . " " No . " " More coffee ? " Her hands were steady as she lifted the heavy silver pot . The fact that she had not called Emilia to perform this task told me she had recognized an unpalatable fact  --  she was going to have to talk to me . " No , thank you . " I had thought I was mad enough to speak plainly , but her superb self-possession weakened my resolve.  |p87I  said hesitantly , " I suppose you think it 's none of my business , but  --  " " You teach , I believe . " I had not told her that . I said , " You had me investigated . " " Of course . You would have done the same in my position . When I received your letters I did not know Bartolommeo was married . You might have been . . . anything . " " Fair enough . But  --  " " I learned you were precisely what you claimed to be  --  Bartolommeo 's legal wife .

' I had hoped you would not be moved to interfere , but I see now that you could not act otherwise . The qualities that lead you to do so are the qualities of youth , and I respect them , though I do not admire them . " I had never been dissected with such cool accuracy , not even by Dr. Baldwin . If she had expressed contempt or anger , I could have responded . Against that dispassionate ( and just ) assessment I had no defense . She went on calmly . " You think me harsh in my dealings with the boy . My methods are not yours , and I feel no obligation to defend them .

Neither . " She smiled . Her teeth looked like icicles . " You are candid , are n't you ? " " I 'm sorry . You may be telling the truth as you see it , but . .. You 're wrong , that 's all . " " My husband died in a hospital in Vicenza , " she said . " He was homicidal and raving mad . His uncle  --  his grand-father  --  " The Gothic atmosphere was so thick you could have cut it with a knife . I expected Mrs. Rochester to burst through the door howling curses . " Look , " I said desperately , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind if I use that term , I hope , instead of ' raving mad ' ? I do know there is no surer way of shattering a child 's mind than telling him he 's doomed to madness . " " I know that too . If I had not known , the psychiatrist Pietro is seeing  --  " " You 're taking him to a psychiatrist ? " Her glacial calm cracked briefly . " I know I am not your idea of a doting grandmother , Kathleen , but neither am I a monster . Will you allow me to tell you what happened withoutinterruptions or emotional outbursts ? " " You 're the one who used the word ' madness , " I said . " Talk about emotionally loaded  --  " " Touche . " I expected her to show resentment , but the smile she gave me was almost friendly . " I will try to avoid such terms . " Pietro 's father was my son . My only son . He was always a practical child , intelligent enough , but without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose you will frown at that reference to hereditary traits . At any rate , Guido showed some talent for business  --  investments , that sort of thing . I have never cared for such matters . After matriculating at Bologna he wanted to go to business school . I sent him to Columbia , in the United States . It was there he met his wife . I disapproved of the marriage . I admit it because I am sure you already suspect as much . But my reasons were not what you may suppose . I did not dislike the young woman because she was an American , I disliked her because she was the worst of America  --  superficial , common , incapable of appreciatinganother way of life . She was a good wife , however . She accompanied Guido on all his business trips . " So my image of the frivolous aristocrats jetting around the world had been way off base . It ought to have been a lesson to me . " It was on one such trip that they were killed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You may have read about the plane crash ; it was one of the worst disasters in recent history . The airliner struck a school in a small town in Switzerland . The children were practicing for the Christmas pageant . " I remembered , of course . The media had not spared their readers and viewers any of the details ; there were endless photographs of the agonized parents trying to clear away pieces of twisted metal to reach the bodies of their children . Even Bart 's cultivated cool had been shaken by the story . I remembered his broken exclamations of shock and dismay .... Had he known his cousin was on that plane ? " Pietro had been placed at school in America . Against my wishes , of course . There is no need for me to tell you of the painful weeks following his arrival here  --  " " You were named guardian in your son 's will ? " " There was no will . How many healthy young people can admit the possibility of dying ? " The answer came readily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but for the first time I sensed she was equivocating  --  not lying , exactly , but not telling the whole truth . I could hardly challenge her , though . I nodded , and after a moment she went on . " I sought psychiatric treatment for him immediately . His behavior was abnormal . Violent explosionsof temper , followed by days of sullen silence . For a while he showed signs , however small , of responding to treatment . Then , when he had been here a little over a month , he ran out of his room in the middle of the night . His cries woke me . He was shouting loudly and incoherently , and laughing . By the time I had roused the servants and followed , he had left the house and climbed a tree  --  one of the big oaks by the gatehouse . I called to him to come down . He said yes , he would come ; he would fly . He waved his arms and laughed and shouted , ' I can do it . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up her embroidery . I said unsteadily , " How did you get him down ? " " We did n't . Alberto climbed up after him , but when he reached out for the boy , Pietro jumped . He landed in a mass of shrubbery , with only scratches and bruises to show for his adventure . " I could think of nothing to say . Children do try to commit suicide . Sometimes they succeed . This was worse than I had imagined . Francesca resumed calmly , " Pietro claimed to have no recollection of the incident . A few weeks ago the second attack occurred . His door was locked  --  I began locking him in after the first attack . The tuttofare was sleeping in the next room . She was awakened by his screams and came for me . He had broken a mirror . Fragments were all around , and he was beating at the empty frame when I entered . There were bloody footprints across the floor . He had raced back and forth , from door to window to mirror , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shards had severed an artery , or if he had used his hands instead of a book to break the mirror , he might have bled to death before anyone reached him . " Now perhaps you understand why I lock the child in his room when there is no one in attendance , and why his activitiesare so restricted . He goes to Firenze three times a week to a psychiatrist , and he is taking medication . " She paused to set a stitch , delicately and precisely , before adding , " I may as well tell you that the medication is given to him in his food , without his knowledge . He made such a fuss , it became impossible to give it to him openly . I 'm sure you disapprove of my methods , Kathleen ; but I hope you will do me the courtesy of not questioning my motives . "  |p93IT  TOOK a large dose of Mark Twain to put me to sleep that night , and for once I was thinking of someone else 's problems instead of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without dreaming . By the following morning my idiot optimism had reasserted itself . Damn it , I just could not accept Francesca 's diagnosis . I did n't care if every shrink in Europe and America confirmed it . The child had not demonstrated any symptoms of mental illness before the death of his parents ; I felt sure Francesca would have mentioned that , as confirmation of her theory . He was emotionally disturbed  --  seriously disturbed  --  Ihad to admit that much . But a hereditary taint ? I felt certain Pete 's doctor did n't share that medieval belief . At least I hoped he did n't . The conversation had cleared up another point I had wonderedabout . Pietro was the last of the Morandinis  --  except for the apocryphal embryo Francesca thought I was carrying . No wonder she was so tolerant of my presence and my criticism . I was n't just an intrusive distant relative by marriage ; I , by God , was the mother of the Heir of the Morandiniswithonly a " raving madman " between it and the title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that occurredto me , and the expression on the face reflected in the mirror was so aghast I could n't help smiling . " Cheer up , you damned fool , " I told my reflection . " Of all the messes you have got into  --  and there have been plenty  --  this is high on the list . " I could n't hang on to the smile , though ; the situation was too serious . I had a nasty suspicion I knew what Francesca was working up to . Oddly enough , our last conversation had given me a grudging respect for the woman . I honesty believed she was doing her best . Her best wasn'tp94good enough , by a long shot , but that was a weakness , not a crime . She had a number of weaknesses , not of character but of prejudice and ignorance . She was intelligent but insensitive , subtle but not complex . Once you identified the basic beliefs that governed her behavior , you could understand , and even predict , what she was going to do . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me point-blank . She wanted me to stay on . She wanted the Heir of the Morandinis born in the family mansion , under her matriarchaleye . If it turned out to be a girl , or a " raving madman , " it and I could go to hell , or anywhere else we wanted to go . If it was what she hoped , then she 'd start the next phase of the campaign . It would be a campaign of indirection and suggestion rather than command ; she knew by now that I was not easily bullied , and of course the very idea of physical coercion was absurd in this day and age . Her methods would be more subtle : Join the gentry , enjoy a life of ease , servants to wait on you , no need to work for a living . Now she had another way of pressuring me  --  the boy . If I stayed , I might be able to help him . The mirrored face was decidedly glum . It had a horrible premonition of what I was planning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it ? I studied myself critically . If there was such a thing as the glow of approaching motherhood , I did n't have it . My hair was a mess . When I met Bart it had been long , falling almost to my waist . He liked it that way ; he 'd twine it around his hands , spread it across his body . . . . The day after the accident I took a pair of scissors and whacked it off . It was growing out now , too short to be braided or coiled , too long to hold a curl . My face was fuller than it had been , thanks to Rosa  --  she was a firstclasscook . The problem was n't my face or hair , it was my figure . Bart had been dead for three months . I could n't be less than three months pregnant . Within a few weeks I shouldp95be showing signs of something more substantial than extra calories and the flabbiness of a winter 's forced inactivity . I had a month  --  six weeks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are going to stay ? Saint Georgiaon her white mouse , riding out to conquer the dragon and rescue a troubled child ? Dr. Baldwin was right ; what you need is intensive psychotherapy . Or a padded cell . If the contessa found out I was not pregnant my departure from the Villa Morandini would be precipitate and unpleasant . I had told Pete ; would he tell his grandmother ? I doubted that he would tell anyone . He had already been warned off the subject . If he did tell her , then the masquerade was over . I would take my lumps and crawl away . I would n't sink so low as to ask him to hold his tongue . Che sera , sera . With a shrug almost as eloquent as Emilia 's , I turned from the mirror . A remark Francesca made at breakfast confirmed my evil suspicions . We kept up the usual banal chitchat while Emilia served us . Not until we were finishing our coffee did Francescasay casually , " Pietro goes to the doctor today . Would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faint but cynical smile , " I will arrange for you to speak with him alone . " " Thank you , " I said , trying to imitate the smile . " I would appreciate that . " Deeper and deeper in , I thought . Everything I do gets me more involved ; everything she does pushes me farther in . I was about to leave the room when she administered another shove . " I am going up now to hear Pietro 's lessons , " she said . " When he is well enough , he takes physical exercise at eleven . I believe you know where ? " I went looking for David  --  out and around , and up the back stairs , instead of trying to retrace the route Emilia had shown me . He was hard at work . I could hear his voice ,  |p96raised  in amiable soliloquy , before I opened the door . When he saw me he went right on quoting . It had to be a quote ; normal people do n't talk that way . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wisely hast shunned the broad way and the green .... ' I do n't know that it 's so wise , though . Why are n't you gamboling on the green this fine morning ? " " I came to invite you to join me  --  us , rather . The football game is on . Eleven o'clock . " " Oh , yeah ? You 've got yourself a man . I 'm looking forward to meeting it conte . " " He 's a sweet kid . Lonely . He lost both parents recently in a plane crash . " " I know . " " Yesterday you told me you 'd never heard of him . " " Good God , but you 're a suspicious wench . After I talked to you , I pumped Rosa for the story . " " Oh . I 'm sorry . " " You should be . Anyone with a face like yours ought to be open , candid , and idiotically trusting . What made you so . . . " He broke off , his smile fading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into my bigger mouth . " " It 's okay . What are those nasty things ? " The table was covered with scraps of fabric , dark brown and black , ranging from fragments a few inches across to larger pieces . " Nasty ? Nasty ! Those , my ignorant innocent , are examples of Coptic and early Arabic embroidery . Not worth their weight in gold , but worth a tidy sum in silver . Part of the count 's Egyptian spoils . These bits and pieces were n't popular when he was on tour ; he appears to have appreciated the unusual . " " They look awful . " " To me they are as lovely as the sunrise over the Duomo . " He picked up one of the scraps . " The best thing about them is that the count had the good sense not to hand them over to the estate washerwoman . Wait till I get through with them . "  |p97I  sat down on my old seat . " What do you do with them ? " " Wash them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrub brush . I 'll have to go into town to pick up some chemicalsand distilled water . Want to go with me ? " " What did you say ? " " Maybe you 're surfeited with the sights of Florence . " He did n't look at me as he spoke , but continued to admire the filthy cloth in his hand . " If you are n't  --  well , I 'm a good guide . I know a little bit about a lot of things . " " I 'd like that . But I ca n't go today . " " No sweat . I can wait till tomorrow . " " Fine . Are you planning to walk ? " " Good Lord , no . As an added inducement , I am offering you a ride on my BMW bike  --  secondhand , but superb . " I thought of the winding , bumpy road , and the carefree habits of Italian drivers . My phobia about driving was pretty well cured , but . .. I said firmly , " I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Okay . Whatever turns you on . " " I 'll see you at eleven , then . " I gave him directions to the garden and added doubtfully , " You wo n't get all wrapped up in your dirty collection and forget , will you ? " " Madam , you cut me to the quick . I 'll be there . " In fact , he was there before me . I had gone to my room to compose a letter to my parents . On my next trip to Florence , I must retrieve the incoherent note I left with Angelo . I could n't remember exactly what I had written , but I could remember the state of mind I 'd been in when I wrote it . The letter took longer than I anticipated . There were so many things I could n't mention , such as my " condition , " and so many others that required careful handling , such as Pete 's illness . I had to make Francesca sound like a harmless , lonely old lady who had welcomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to convince the readers that I wasp98well , happy , and in my right mind . It took three attempts to produce something that succeeded , if only partially , in these aims . I folded the delicate , gold-edged paper and put it in the delicate , gold-edged envelope with the Morandini crest . The stationery had appeared overnight in one of the drawers of the desk-secretary  --  another of those little amenities to which Francesca assumed I would quickly become accustomed . When I reached the garden they were both there , sitting on the marble bench . Pete was swinging his legs and talking a blue streak . David leaned forward , arms resting on his knees , listening with intent interest , and nodding occasionally . When I opened the gate Pete jumped up . " Go out for a pass , " he yelled . I had to run forward to catch it . " Not bad , " said David critically . " She has the good hands , " Pete said . " Now throw to me , signora . " " Wait a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " David said . " Boys against girls ? " He grinned wickedly . " You 're a crook , " I said . Pete chuckled . " A crook , a crook . He is . How can there be two against one ? " David said , perfectly deadpan , " She throws the ball , and then runs down and catches it , while we try to tackle her . " Pete broke up . He laughed so hard he had to sit down . David jabbed him in the ribs . " Do n't laugh . We might have conned her into it . " After some more low-class clowning from David we decidedPete would play offense with both of us . He was the quarterback , of course . He was also a running back and all the front linesmen . Once when Pete faked and pulled in the ball to run , David tackled him with such gusto I yelped in protest , but Pete loved it . We did n't stop until we were all red-faced and winded . The score was Pete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David stayed on the ground after the final play , flat on his back , staring up at the sky . Pete sat on his stomach . " Are you o-kay ? Did I hurt you ? " " I could breathe better if you 'd get off my diaphragm , " David said , rolling the boy off him with a sudden heave . Pete sat cross-legged on the grass beside him . We discussed some of the finer points of the game , and David promised to give Pete some pointers on kicking . Pete nobly admitted that kickingwas not one of his best skills . Finally David said , " I 'd better get back to work . Thanks for the exercise , gang ; that was a lot more fun than jogging . " " We will do it tomorrow ? " Pete asked hopefully . " Sure . Same time , same place . " He ambled off without a backward look . I said , " I guess I had better change for lunch . You too , sport . " " Sport . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew he was thinking of his visit to the doctor . I had hoped he would mention it , but he did n't ; so I took a deep breath and prepared to tackle something a lot heavier than my erstwhile opponent . " I have a favor to ask , Pete . " " Of course , signora . " He looked so pleased at the idea ofdoing something for me , I hated to tell him what it was . " Can I go with you to Florence this afternoon ? " His face shut up like a curtained window . " Did she say youshould come ? " " Yes . You see . . . " I wanted to touch him , but he was so far away from me he might as well have been on another planet . " You see , after Bart died , I was sick . I was in a hospital for several months , and I had to see a doctor  --  a psychiatrist  --  everyday . I have n't been to my doctor since I left home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You were sick ? Like  --  " One finger touched his head . He had n't picked that up from Francesca . Probably the tuttofare , or Emilia , or the cook . " Right , " I said . " Sick in thep100head . People can get sick there , just as they can get sick in their stomachs or their legs . " " But they get better , " Pete said slowly . He picked up a stick and began poking holes in the dirt . " Oh , sure they do . It takes a while ; sometimes it seems as if it takes a very long time . I 'm better . But I thought since you were going to see your doctor , maybe I could see him too . Just to make sure  --  you know  --  " He nodded . I was glad he knew . I did n't know what the hell I was talking about . But I had to give him some reason for seeing the doctor alone . I did n't want him to think I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with all the other adults . I knew only too well how that felt . He went on poking holes  --  nice , neat holes that formed symmetrical patterns . I said , " If you do n't want me to come , I wo n't , Pete . " " I want you to come . " " Thank you . " He went on , as if I had not spoken . " I want you to be better . " My breath caught . It was n't easy to speak lightly , but I tried . " We had better get moving , then . All that exercise has made me hungry . I could eat a horse . " " No , you could not ! Could you ? " I held out my hand . " I 'm so weak you 'll have to help me up . " He did , with much grunting and puffing . It gave me an excuse to hold his hand as we walked to the gate . Francesca was n't the only one who was pushing me farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of saying good-bye to Pete . And how ironic that the only person in the house to whom I had told the truth ( if not the whole truth ) was a ten-year-old boy.  |p101IT  WAS too warm to wear my wool suit , so I put on a cotton blouse and skirt . Next to Francesca , cool and slim in palegreenlinen , I looked like the tuttofare . As we were finishing lunch , Emilia produced Pete , like a parcel to be taken to the post office . He did n't look like the same child who had laughed and joked and rolled on the grass . Sullen resentment coated his features like a thin , congealedmask . We went out to the car and Alberto leaped to open the door . His manner toward me was almost as obsequious as it was to Francesca . Her style of living did have an insidious appeal . It would be easy to fall into the habit of treating people like objects , especially when they were people you did n't like . I noticed that Pete kept as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car . It seemed more like distaste than fear , but it annoyed me , and prompted me to commit another impertinence . When we were ensconced , with Pete , stiff and silent as a doll , between me and Francesca , I said , " Does Alberto have sterling qualities I fail to observe , Francesca ? I 'm surprised you keep such an unattractive person on your staff . " Pete gave me a startled look . Francesca smiled , as if she enjoyed sparring with me . Fine , I thought ; I 'll give her plenty of opportunities . " He does have admirable qualities you have not had occasion to observe , Kathleen . Loyalty , for one . Unquestioning obedience , for another . They are more important to me than a handsome face or fine manners . I do n't dine with him , after all . " " He would die for the Morandinis ? " I asked , investing the words with ironic quotation marks.  | " Yes , " she said flatly . " Is n't that rather medieval ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you when you first came to the gate . It wo n't happen again . Naturally , if you have any complaints about him you will tell me . " I wondered if there was anything Francesca did n't know about . Well , yes  --  there were a few things . Pete was still staring at me with shocked admiration . I winked at him . Francesca talked to me and occasionally addressed a remarkto Pete . I talked to both of them . Pete sometimes spoke to me , but never said a word to Francesca . I could only dimly imagine what those drives must be like when the two of them were alone . Pete must dread the trip as much as he dreaded the doctor . Dr. Manetti 's office was in a building that had once been a Renaissance palazzo , but the office itself was as modem as any I had seen . Like his colleagues the world over , the doctor appeared to be making a good living . The waiting room was furnished with lush plants and handsome pseudo- ( or genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the only ones there , and when the door to the inner sanctum opened , it was the nurse , who told Pete to come in . Presumably the previous patient had been spirited out a back door . That 's how Dr. Baldwin had arranged it . Pete went with a little squaring of his shoulders that I found infinitely touching . He did not look back . We waited for the regulation fifty minutes . Francesca looked through the magazines on the table , commenting now and then on an article or a picture . Not until the " hour " was almost up did she say , " I will meet Pietro in the outer office . I have explained to Dr. Manetti why you are here . Take all the time you like , ask whatever you wish . He has been instructed to tell you anything you want to know . "  |p103She  had timed it perfectly . The last word was hardly out of her mouth when the nurse reappeared . " Signora ? " Francesca put her magazine down , smoothed her gloves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke English ; there would not have been much point to my seeing him if he did n't . His greeting was not only fluent , it was flawless , with scarcely a trace of an accent . " It is a pleasure to meet you , Mrs. Morandini . May I express my condolences ? I had not the pleasure of knowing your husband , but the contessa has often spoken of him . " He was much younger than I had expected , and not at all like the conventional stereotype of a psychiatrist  --  unless it was the television-movie stereotype . He wore slacks and a white shirt open at the neck , with an emblem on the pocket . It fit his muscular body like a second skin . His face and throat and arms were a gorgeous golden bronze and his hair was only a few shades darker . He was almost as handsome as Bart . He held a chair for me and then , instead of retreating behind the professional barrier of his desk , sat down on the couch , his pose deliberately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interest in the boy , " he said . " Do I understand that you have worked with emotionally disturbed children ? " I admitted the limitations of my experience and mentioned Francesca 's idee fixe about hereditary mental illness . Manetti laughed good-naturedly . " She is a remarkable woman . Very modern in many ways , and yet these old superstitions lin-ger . " By the end of the hour we were on first-name terms . He was very easy to talk to  --  subtly flattering in his keen attention , quick to agree with my statements  --  and then , discreetly , insinuating reservations , or " redefinitions , " as he called them . When I found myself moving toward the doorp104I realized I had been given a standard fifty-minute hour . No doubt Francesca would have to pay for it . I ca n't say that idea upset me very much . He started to open the door , then paused and said in a sudden change from his professional smoothness , " I wonder . . . Would you perhaps . . . Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening ? I am very proud of my ' home town , ' as you say in America , and I like to show it off to visitors . " I was surprised , but not at all averse to the idea . I said I 'd be delighted . He said I was very kind . I said not at all , he was kind to ask me . He said he would telephone . I decided not to mention the invitation to Francesca . He probably would n't call anyway . When we got down to the street the car was nowhere to be seen . Francesca looked vexed . " I told Alberto to be here at four . " " He 's probably stuck in traffic , " I said . " There 's a cafe  --  why do n't we have some ice cream ? I think we deserve it , do n't you , Pete  --  Pietro ? " Francesca 's expression was that of a woman who has been offered a dish of pickled mice , and it did not change after we took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faded awning . I must admit I was pushing her deliberately , to see how far I could go , and I must also admit she tried to be a good sport . She even ordered coffee . She did n't drink it , though . Pete and I had the biggest sundaes on the menu . They were n't called sundaes ; I forget the names . We selected them from a card , complete with color photographs displayed next to the door of the cafe . The flavors were a little peculiar to American taste buds  --  a touch of black currant , a touch of coconut , and some kind of liqueur . I could n't finish mine , so Pete kindly offered to finish it for me . He also kindly allowed me to mop his chin with a napkin dipped in the glass of waterp105I had requested . A shudder rippled through Francesca 's body , but she did n't say anything . Except for an occasional wary glance at his grandmother , Pete behaved like a normal child while we ate our ice cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , he relapsed into silence . Alberto mumbled apologies for being late ; Francesca cut him off with a brusque gesture . I did most of the talking on the way home . Francesca repliedcourteously to my questions about the places we passed , but did not volunteer any information until we turned into the narrow , upward road , and I commented on the wildness of the area . " It 's part of the estate , " she said . " From the turn to the top of the hill and beyond . " " All that ? It must be hundreds of acres . " " We have not yet been forced to give up all that was ours . Many other families have sold the land ; it is now occupied by cheap little houses and shops . That may happen here one day , but I hope I am not alive to see it . " For once there was genuine emotion in her voice . She cared more about places than about people . SEBASTIANO  --  DR . MANETTI  --  did call , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologized for calling so early . It was a nice touch of flattery , implying that he had awakened at dawn , panting with desire , and had barely managed to control himself until a decent hour . I accepted an invitation to dinner the following evening . " I do n't have any formal clothes with me , " I warned him . He laughed . " It is time you learned something about modernItaly , Kathleen . The only time I wear evening dress iswhen I must attend some boring professional dinner party . "  |p106I  said I would look forward to it ; and I meant what I said . My social life was certainly improving . Football and ragpickingwith David , dinner with the shrink . Francesca was obviously curious about the call , which had come while we were at breakfast , but she was too well-bred to ask outright . Instead she dropped a sly hint . " It would be courteous , Kathleen , if you would tell Emilia when you plan to be absent at mealtime . Ordinarily I would n't ask it of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand . I 'll make a point of doing so . " " Dr. Manetti tells me that you are a good influence on Pietro . " She must have telephoned him as soon as we got home . I smiled modestly ; she went on , " He approves of the games , and the time you spend with the boy . He said he had cautionedyou about certain matters  --  " " I 'll be careful , Francesca . I 'm not as stupid as I look , hon-estly . " " I do n't think you are at all stupid , " she said . After breakfast I went up to the attic to remind David we had a date to tackle each other at eleven . At least that was one of my reasons . There was n't much else to do . My embroiderybored me , I had read most of the books I had bought , and exploring the desolate gardens had only limited appeal . So I offered my services as assistant scrounger . He looked at me doubtfully , scratching his chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as dusty . " If you 're going into this with some expectation of unearthing a box of rubies and diamonds , forget it . There is a method to this apparent madness , and I insist on following proper proce-dures . " " I will obey orders to the letter . " " Okay . That 's what I 'm looking for  --  letters . I found a box of miscellaneous papers that has to be sorted . There 's allp107kinds of stuff here  --  newspaper clippings , patterns for ladies ' bonnets , accounts . I want it sorted , first by category and then by date . If you 're in doubt about anything , put it in the miscellaneousbox . " The miscellaneous box was overflowing when I finished . I apologized for my lack of skill ; David said I 'd get the hang of it  --  which I doubted  --  and we went to find Pete . He was a little late that morning  --  a nasty session with Italian history , I gathered  --  but his glum expression brightened when he saw us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At noon David called a halt . " I 've got to go to Florence to pick up the stuff I told you about , " he explained to Pete , man to man . " See you tomor-row ? " " I can not , " Pete said with a glance at me . I gathered that his appointment had been changed , and that he was to see the doctor in the morning . " The day after , then , " David said . " That 's Saturday . You do n't have lessons on Saturday , do you ? We 'll start early and have a good long practice . " " O-kay ! " After he had gone David said , " I 'm going to do you the honor of changing my clothes . Meet you in fifteen minutes . " " But I thought  --  " " You forgot . Or you changed your mind ? " " Neither . I thought you had forgotten . " " I had planned to leave earlier , but we could n't disappoint the kid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florence and do the shopping later . I know a great trattoria . Cheap . " " O-kay , " I said . " I wonder where Alberto put my car . He 's got the keys , too . " " The car is in the garage . I 'll extract your keys from Alberto and pick you up out in front , like a proper chauffeur . Unless you do n't want to be seen fraternizing with the hired help . " " Do n't be silly . Make it twenty minutes . "  |p108I  met Emilia in the hall and was pleased to inform her I would not be in to lunch . It really was short notice ; if I had been as rude to my mother , Pa would have let me have it , but Emilia murmured a meek " thank you . " It took me a little longer than twenty minutes . David was waiting . He came to a snappy salute when I appeared , but his expression was sour . " What 's the matter ? " I asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chatted with Alberto . " " What did he say ? " " Never mind . " " Something about me ? " " It was n't so much what he said , it was the way he said it . " " Oh . I trust you punched him in the nose for insulting a lady ? " " Are you kidding ? I 'm the original chicken . He may be twenty years older than I am , but he is also forty pounds heavier , with a reach like a gorilla 's . Probably learned commandowarfare under it duce . " " Is he that old ? " " I do n't know or care how old he is . Let 's not talk about him . " I had such a good time that afternoon I never thought what a good time I was having . David knew the back streets of Florence the way I knew the alleys of Wayford , Massachusetts ; and if his casual greetings were any indication , he knew half the inhabitants of Florence , too . Beggars , street cleaners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemnly , " I 'm a charter member of the fraternity of the poor . It 's an international association , confined to people who know what it 's like to be hungry  --  really hungry , not just a little peckish . I can always count on a handout from a fellow member . Generosity is a quality restricted to the impoverished , you know . The rich scatter largesse when they need a taxp109deduction , and then make pious remarks about how superior they are to the lazy , shiftless recipients of their charity . " It was one of the longest speeches he had made on any subject except Margaret Fuller . I said , " I suspect you are a radical socialist . " " Absolutely . " " You 'll have to meet my father . " We had lunch at his favorite trattoria , where the waiter greeted him like a long-lost buddy . We saw some of the standard tourist sights , and some that were not so standard . At the Accademia he lectured me on Florentine sculpture , and when we stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked if I noticed the resemblance . He had n't been boastingwhen he said he knew a little bit about a lot of things , and his enthusiasm was contagious . It was late in the afternoon before we finally got around to his errands . They took us to a dark little shop in a back street where , after a long discussion , David loaded several armfuls of bottles and packagesinto the trunk of the car . " This is really a help , " he said as we drove away . " I manage okay with the bike , but its trunk space is limited . " " Stock up on supplies any time . " " Thanks , I may do that . It 's none of my business , but are you a rich heiress , despite your demure and modest appearance ? I mean , if you want to turn the car in you could save yourself a few bucks , and I 'd be glad to take you into town whenever you are reluctant to make use of Alberto 's ser-vices . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my keeping the car ; it was costing a small fortune , and I did n't really need it . I do n't know why I should have felt a frisson of panic at the idea of giving up a means of escape ... . Escape ? Say rather mobility  --  independence . " I 'll keep the idea in mind , " I said , and was obscurely relieved when he did n't press the point.  |p110I  had told him I needed to pick up something at my former hotel , so we went there after we had finished with the chemist . There was no one on duty at the desk ; after I banged and yelled , a scrubwoman shuffled out of a back room and informedme that Angelo was not there . I had already deduced that . Thanks to David 's superior Italian we learned that Angelowas next door , at the coffee bar , so we went in search of him . Angelo was drinking coffee as if he were being paid to do so . He probably needed gallons of caffeine to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face did n't exactly light up , but it became a shade less pensive . " Ah , " he said . " The friend has come . " I looked at David , who looked back at me with amused curiosity , and decided not to explain . I simply smiled noncommittallyand introduced them . The title it professore did not impress Angelo . After all , his brother was a policeman . I asked about my letter . Angelo pressed his hand to the pocket of his shirt . " It is here , signorina . Always , next to my heart . " " You can give it back to me , Angelo . I 'm very grateful for your help . " " You want it ? You do n't want I should mail it ? " " No . But thank you . " Angelo 's face became , if possible , even blanker . He was thinking . After a while he arrived at some conclusion  --  I did n't ask what it was ; I did n't want to know . He nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He handed me the letter . It was somewhat the worse for wear . Apparently he had not exaggerated when he said he always carried it next to his heart . David suggested another cup of coffee , an offer Angelo was quick to accept . However , he rejected David 's suggestion that we sit down . " There is an extra charge , professore . The coffee is the same if we stand ; why pay more ? "  |p111The  two of them entered into an animated conversation , while I shifted from one foot to the other and tried to catch a few words . I would n't have blamed David for being curious about the byplay with the letter , but the occasional word I did understand suggested that they were discussing something else . We parted with friendly salutes all around and Angelo 's assurance that if I ever again wanted to leave a secret message with him , he would be happy to oblige . On our way back we were fighting through the traffic at the Piazza della Indipendenza when David waved at the whiteuniformedpoliceman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maelstrom of cars and motorbikes . " Was that Angelo 's brother ? " I asked . " What gave you that idea ? " " I caught the word fratello during your conversation . Angelois very proud of his brother . " " And rightly so . He 's no mere traffic cop , but an honestto-Godplainclothes detective . " Perhaps that explained Angelo 's mild obsession with secretsand mysteries . But it did n't explain David 's gesture ; I persisted , " Do you always wave to traffic cops ? " " I happen to know that guy , " David said , grinning . " A slight contretemps concerning the right-of-way in a traffic circle . . . . But I always make friends with cops when I can ; you never know when a friend in the force will come in handy . " When we arrived at the villa we found the gates had been closed . David stopped the car . " What do we do now ? " " What do you usually do ? " " Go in the back door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north side , big enough for the bike . " " Watch . " I leaned on the horn . At first I was afraid my gesture was going to fall flat . Then the shrubs behind the lodge shook violently , as if they had been struck by a miniature , invisible whirlwind . A grotesquep112figure burst out into the open . Capering and crooning in a tuneless , high-pitched monotone , he wove a fantastic pattern of stumbling steps across the gravel . " Good God , " David breathed . " Who the hell is that ? " " Alberto 's assistant . Have n't you seen him before ? " " Never at close range . Do you think he 's going to openthe gate ? " " I think he 's working up to it . " The stooped figure wore clothes that looked like Alberto 's cast-offs . They flapped loosely around his body , and the cap came down to the bridge of his nose . From under the cap long , lank hair tumbled onto his neck and over his face . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gates , and , after another interval of hoppingand singing , dealt with the other . David reached in his pocket ; but when he pulled up a few feet and offered the crumpled bill to the temporary gatekeeper the man let out a screech of terror and fled . " Do n't chase him , " I said , as David started to open the door . " You 'll only frighten him more . " " I guess you 're right . " We drove on in silence . I assumed David 's thoughts ran along the same path as mine  --  wondering how Alberto treated his unfortunate assistant  --  and suspecting the worst . David put the car in the garage , next to the Mercedes , and handed me the keys . I handed them back . " Had n't you better unlock the trunk first ? I 'll help you unload . " " That 's okay , I can manage . " " Thanks for today . I had a marvelous time . " " Me , too . " He unlocked the trunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched , and for a moment we stood without moving or speaking . I hated to have the afternoon end . The Malones are great huggers and kissers ; but somehow I could n't  |p113offered  . We parted formally , thanking one another again in voices that had become strangely reserved . I treated Francesca to another scathing critique of her servantthat evening , describing the condition of the dog 's pen and questioning his fitness to supervise a mentally handicappedperson . She appeared faintly amused by what she would probably call my " qualities of youthful idealism . " " I assure you that the person to whom you refer is not abused by Alberto , " she said . " As for the dog , discipline is necessary for a guard dog . The animal is not a pet . " " Discipline is one thing , cruelty is another . A dog does n't have to be vicious to be a good guard dog . " She promised to speak to Alberto and then deftly turned the conversation to a subject she knew would distract me . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pietro . No doubt I had encountered other disturbed children when I was teaching . She would be happy to listen to any advice I cared to give . There is one form of flattery to which everyone is susceptible : being asked for advice . She let me babble on , interruptingonly to ask questions that proved she was listening with close attention . I was feeling pretty full of myself when I went up to bed . Smug is hardly the word . A few more weeks and I 'd have everybody straightened out ; then I would make a dignified exit , bowing , amid the plaudits of the crowd . The dog would lick my hand , Alberto would apologize and promise reform , Francesca would thank me for showing her the light , Pete ... I would hate to leave Pete . But he would be o-kay . Thanks to me . Even youth is no excuse for that kind of conceit . I had finished Mark Twain . I shuffled through the rest of the books and realized I had read the lot . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No more Gothic romances , though . The heroine of Bride of the Madman was a perfect fool . Sticking grimly to her job in spite of stones that rolled offp114cliffs , narrowly missing her ; in spite of the sinister housekeeper ; in spite of the hero , scarred and brooding , who was n't the type I 'd have cared to spend an afternoon with , much less a lifetime . I tossed the book contemptuously aside . I often thought back on that gesture . As I said , it 's a good thing I 'm not superstitious . THE MATTRESS yielded gently . Bart was sitting beside me . The moonlight streamed in the window , showing every featurein stark detail . The flash of even white teeth as he smiled , the little mole on the sculptured curve of his left cheekbone , the hollow under the bone , the scattering of black hairs across his chest . His fingers brushed my breast and shoulder in a pattern achingly familiar . He had such smooth hands . Not soft , like a woman 's , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughness of normal flesh . Brushing and touching , gently at first , then firmer , with little , knowing pressures here , there . . . . Moving up to my throat and cheek , into my hair . Sometimes I had dreamed of waking into nightmarish reality , and fought to wake again . I had followed his retreating figure down endless shadow streets and wakened weeping with frustration . Now I had found him ; and it was worse . My lips parted , my throat tensed to cry out . His mouth muffledthe cry . For a split second I felt his lips , tasted them . Then all sensation was blotted out . I woke with the echo of a scream in my ears and knew it had been my own . The room was almost dark . The moonlight was dim , the gauzy curtains were closed . The straps of my nightgown were pulled down , baring my body to the waist.  |p115It  took me a good five minutes to find my purse and the little bottle lying at the bottom under a jumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat down in a chair to wait for it to work . I had turned on every light in the room , but I could n't force myself to get back into the bed . A faint scent still seemed to linger around it  --  the scent of the aftershaveBart had used . Why had n't Dr. Baldwin warned me this might happen ? Well , but he had hinted at it when he questioned me about my sexual impulses . At the time I did n't have any . Not surprising , he said soothingly . ( Nothing surprises a psychiatrist . ) I was a young , healthy woman . Someday ... Fine . But I had not expected that when the day came it would be Bart 's ghost that aroused me . As the drug began to take effect , relaxing muscles and dulling horror , I decided I might survive this too . Maybe it was a stage of convalescence . Maybe I had to dream about Bart making love to me before I could dream of someone else . Maybe my dead husband was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I was n't conscious of wanting to go to bed with either of them , but they were both attractive men , in very different ways . A lot of people would tell me that was what I needed  --  a good , satisfying roll in the hay , withoutemotional commitments . And maybe they 'd be right . I went to the window . The moon hung tangled in the cypress tops , a lopsided ellipsoid , a silver football . I could n't see David 's window , but I pictured him scrubbing his nasty little bits of fabric , or sitting up in bed , reading  --  culling new scraps of wisdom from the nineteenth-century poets . Somehowit made me feel better to know he was there . But I spent the rest of the night sitting up in the chair.  |p117SUNLIGHT  MIGHT have improved my state of mind , but there was none the next morning . The skies were a soft pearly gray . Francesca said rain was predicted for that evening . She seemed a little distraught  --  nothing definite I could point to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostess , she did not fail to notice my hollow eyes , though I thought I had hid the signs of sleeplessness rather well . I admitted I had not slept well . I had n't meant to tell her the reason , but her look of concern seemed genuine , and I desperately needed to tell someone  --  not the whole truth , but part of it . I said , " I had a bad dream . A nightmare , actually . About Bart . " The lines in her forehead deepened . " To dream of someone you love  --  is that a nightmare ? "  | " It can be . " " Will it help you to talk about it ? I have not asked about him , or about the accident . . . " " It does n't really help . I 've already . . . " I pushed my chair back and went to the window . " I guess you 're entitled to know , though . You were fond of him . " " Yes . " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . " He had moved in before , actually , but why mention that ? " I had a little house  --  it was the guest house of an estate . Only two rooms and kitchen and bath , but I was delighted to have found it  --  in the country , yet close enough to make commuting feasible . There was even a bus line at the bottom of the hill . Sometimes I took the bus when the weather was bad . The road to my house was a private road , narrow and steep . After a heavy snow it could be dangerous . Bart . . . Bart enjoyed driving it . It was a challenge to him , especially when it was slippery with ice . " " He was an excellent driver , " said the calm voice behind me . " I know . He told me he had driven racing cars . The first time he took me up that road , in a heavy snowstorm , I was scared to death . He was laughing . " " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We had six inches of snow the day before . It was wetsnow , packed down ; cold temperatures during the night frozeit solid . He  --  he 'd been away . He came back that morning , not to stay , just to pick up some things . I was outside shovelingthe walk . When he drove away I stood watching .... " I saw it now , vivid as reality . The sun , blindingly brighton the snowy slopes , the dark band of trees at the foot of thehill . The car , a splash of brilliant crimson in the stark blackand-whitelandscape , appearing and disappearing around thecurves , growing smaller with each appearance . The roadp119shimmering with colorless brilliance , empty of traffic . The final appearance of the tiny , toy vehicle as it swung  --  too fast , out of control  --  into the main road far below . I turned . " We quarreled . I was angry because he had n't come home the night before . He said he 'd tried to call , that the lines were down because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said things .... And he was n't the man to take criticism meekly . The last thing I said to him was  --  was somethinghateful . He always drove too fast when he was furious . I ie was driving too fast that day . I had seen him cope with conditions as bad , or worse . If he had n't been angry  --  if we had n't argued ... " I did not expect absolution from her . There was neither sympathy nor condemnation in her voice when she replied . " I thought as much . I wo n't insult you by pointing out that your feelings of guilt are both normal and unnecessary . Your doctors must have said the same . " " You know about that , too . " " Of course . Are you ashamed of it ? " She gestured . " Sit down and finish your coffee . " I needed the caffeine ; I was still groggy from taking the Valium so late at night . Instead of asking more questions she began to talk about Bart . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or coo about how cute he had been ; but the relationship I had pictured became clearer as she went on . Bart had been several years younger than his cousin Guido , but always in their encounters he came out best . His sayings were wittier , his laughter more engaging ; he ran faster , hit a tennis ball more accurately , swam more strongly . Guido sounded like a singularly dull lad . When I asked , Francesca showed me a photograph of him , taking it from a drawer . The only photo on display was the one of Bart . The cousins stood side by side , not touching . Bart mustp120have been about twelve then ; he was already almost as tall as his cousin . The contrast between the two was painful . Guido had none of the family good looks . His long , mournful face resembled that of an amiable horse . He stood stiff and unsmiling , arms at his sides . Bart 's head was thrown back , laughing . My preconceptions about Guido could n't have been more inaccurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady , dependable , reliable  --  all the boring virtues . Pete did n't resemblehim at all . Nor , except for those startling silver eyes , did Pete look like the Morandinis . Maybe that accounted for Francesca 's indifference to him . Francesca did not invite me to go with them to the doctor that day . However , she did mention the matter of transportation . Alberto was available to take me to Florence whenever I wished ; did I want to return my rental car , or have him do it for me ? I finessed the question , but it bothered me . This was the second time in twenty-four hours someone had worried about that car . It was uncharacteristic of Francesca to do so ; why should she care what it was costing me ? After she had gone I jogged around the drive a while , getting some much-needed exercise . The air had the breathlesshush that often heralds a storm , but I knew the clouds were n't heavy enough for that ; the breathless , restless feeling was not in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something , but I could n't think of anything I really wanted to do . The options were limited : sort junk with David , jog up and down the drive , explore the grounds . Finally I went to my room to review my wardrobe . I did n't want to do that either , but I had to find something to wear to dinner . My clothes were whisked away , laundered and returned , almost as soon as I took them off ; even so , I had very little to choose from . I had not been concerned about clothes when I packed , and I cer/tainly had not given much thought to the season . I might have known it would be cold in Florence in April , part of the time at least . Everything I had was too big or too lightweight or too shabby . I should have gone to Florence with Francesca to buy a decent dress . I should go now . I did n't feel like doing that either . Thoroughly disgusted with myself , I slammed the wardrobedoor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treacherous body still tingled with the memory of my dream . A cold shower is the conventional remedy for what ailed me . I was n't that Spartan , so I decided to try cold air . It was getting on toward the time when David took his morning break . If he was jogging around his exercise yard , I would jog with him . I went out the front door and around the house . David was n't outside . Feeling like a child who has no one to play with , I wandered toward Pete 's so-called play yard . A sudden sharp yelp from the dog made me jump , it sounded so close . I heard Alberto 's voice and the dog 's response  --  a burst of excited barking . I had never heard it bark before , and curiosity drew me toward the sound . When the dog stopped to draw breath Alberto laughed  --  either that or he was scraping a rusty metal bar across a stone . They seemed to be having a jolly time , but there was a quality in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frenzied note of excitement . If Alberto was teasing him , I 'd have a word or two to say ... . Then I heard something that made me break into a headlongrun  --  the high , piercing screams of an animal in pain or desperate terror . The gate was n't locked . I burst through it like a cannonball and skidded to a stop . The dog was loose . Its chain lay coiled on the ground beside it . It was facing away from me , crouched , its haunches quivering with eagerness , but restrained by the stick Alberto held . He stood a few feet beyond the dog , thep122stick in one hand . From the other , raised high above his head , dangled a small ball of bedraggled fur . The ball of fur was screaming . The dog must have already got to it ; blood dripped from its side . The next few seconds were a blur . When I got my wits back , I was standing next to Alberto with the kitten clutched to my chest . All ten of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alberto had n't moved . The stick still hovered , the other arm was still raised . I used to play basketballwith Mike and Jim , but I never made a jump like that one . How long the tableau would have held I do not know . Alberto was paralyzed by surprise ; the dog did n't know what the hell he was supposed to do , if anything ; I was so furious I could n't catch my breath , so furious a red haze clouded my vision . The spell was broken by a bellow of alarm and a flying body . An outthrust arm sent me staggering back . The dog began to bark , the kitten screamed and dug its laws in deeper ; David knocked the stick out of Alberto 's hand , and Alberto pulled back his fist and hit David in the face . David tumbled over backward . The dog leaped for his throat . I was afraid to let go of the kitten , or carry it close to the dog . I kicked Alberto in the leg . " Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronto  --  move it , you  --  you --  " I could n't think of any name bad enough to call him . He gave me a startled look and then reached for the dog 's collar , lifting it as easily as he had lifted the kitten . David lay on his back , knees drawn up , arms crossed over his face and throat . He said , " Is it off me ? " " Yes , it 's off you . Are you all right ? " David scrambled to his feet . He examined his shirt sleeve and said indignantly , " My shirt 's torn . " " Small loss , " I said , eyeing the faded garment . Out of the corner of my eye I saw Alberto quietly backing away , drag/king the dog with him . Suddenly the full enormity of what had happened swept over me like a huge wave , and I had trouble controlling my voice . " Are you really okay ? " I squeaked . " I ca n't believe  --  " " The dog knew me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have been long before auld acquaintance was forgot , but he was confused enough to hold back for a few seconds . What a damned fool thing to do ! " " It certainly was . Alberto was n't threatening me . " David sputtered . " I was n't referring to myself , I was referringto you . I heard what was going on and was rushing to the rescue . The damned gate stuck , and I was trying to open it when you came barreling in . My God , Kathy , you sailed past that dog 's jaws with an inch to spare . You ought to know better than to startle a neurotic animal like that . Not to mention Alberto . He might have  --  " " Well , he did n't . " " Do n't you ever stop and think before you jump ? " " Not often enough . " His face softened . " Oh , what the hell . Let 's see what you 've got there . " He held out his hands . I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , David , I 'm afraid  --  " " It could n't hold on that tight if it were badly hurt , " David said reassuringly . " Come on up to my room . I 've got some first-aid stuff , and some milk left over from breakfast . " David 's voice and touch finally persuaded the little creature to let go . The milk helped too ; it practically fell into the saucer , it was so hungry . The only cute thing about it was its size . Otherwise it was a mess , skinny and dirty , its coat dull and matted and full of burrs . It was so young it did n't know how to drink properly . It kept sneezing and putting its front paws into the milk . David filled the saucer a second time when it had been lickedp124clean . Neither of us spoke . Finally the frantic lapping slowed . The kitten lifted a milky muzzle , and after a moment we heard a faint , uncertain purr . I burst into tears . A short time later David said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over with tears . " I mumbled into his shoulder , " I did n't know Browning was such a male chauvinist . " " Thackeray , not Browning . Nor Brown , for that matter . I merely meant to point out that there 's nothing to cry about now . " I moved away from him . " Sorry , " I said snuffily . " It was just ... " " I know . " One arm still rested on my shoulders . He gave me a quick , brotherly squeeze , and then took his arm away . " Let 's see about some first aid , shall we ? " The kitten was howling again by the time he finished , but its shrieks sounded more indignant than pained . The cut on its side was n't as bad as I had feared . David smeared on antiseptic lotion from his kit and , despite the kitten 's furious struggles , dunked it up to its nose in a basin of warm water . When he took it out , the water was black with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " I asked , as he set about drying and grooming his victim . " Oh , we always had animals around . My sisters and I dragged home all the neighborhood strays . " " Sounds like my family . Is that your comb ? " " It 's the only one I 've got , " David said cheerfully . " Too bad I do n't own a hair drier . I 've never gone in for that sort of elegant grooming . But it 's a warm day ; he wo n't catch cold . He looks better , does n't he ? " He had rolled the kitten in a towel ; all I could see was a pointed face and two big ears . The eyes had a distinctly resentfulexpression . The face was prettily marked , however . The dark M of the tabby markings stood out against a silvery gray background , and the pink nose and spiky whiskers werep125set in a symmetrical frame of white . The eyes blinked and started to close . " He 's pooped , " David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vet now , while he 's too limp to resist . " " You 're nuttier than I am . What are you going to do with it  --  him ? " " Keep him , I guess . What else is there to do ? " " Bring him to me when you get back from the vet . " " But you ca n't  --  " " I 'm going to give him to Pete . " By the time I had fetched the car keys for David and changed my clothes , I was late for lunch . I did n't care . I felt marvelous . There is nothing like a storm of rage to clear away the clouds of depression . I told Francesca what had happened , without mincing any words . " I do n't think it 's the first time . I 've heard about people who train fighting dogs that way , by letting them kill smaller animals . " Her face wore an expression of fastidious disgust . " NaturallyI would never have permitted such a thing had I been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would n't have been aware , or made any effort to find out . I said , " Do you mind if I am present when you speak to Alberto about it ? " " You think I will not be forceful enough ? " " I just want to watch him squirm , " I said . She smiled faintly . " I will tell Emilia to bring him here after we have finished . " It was a delightful interview . I enjoyed every minute of it . I could n't understand what Francesca said , but her voice crackled with anger , and by the time she finished with him Alberto was practically groveling . He had not once looked in my direction . " Are you satisfied ? " Francesca asked . " One more thing , " I said . " Tell him I 'm holding him re/sponsible for the cat . If anything happens to it  --  anything  --  I will assume he 's to blame . " She raised her eyebrows , but did as I asked . Alberto looked at me then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brows . I expected him to show resentment ; I was the one who had got him in trouble , and it really was n't fair to hold him accountable for the animal . It might run away or be injured by some wild creature . But I saw no resentment on his face , only the same fawning humility he gave Francesca . She dismissed him with a curt command and then looked at me . " You are keeping the animal ? " " I 'm sorry . I forgot my manners . I tend to do that when I 'm angry . I 'd like to give him to Pete , if you have no objec-tion . " " So long as he keeps it out of my way . I do not care for cats . But are you sure it is wise ? " " What do you mean ? " " You seem to be fond of animals . Do you think this one will be safe with Pietro ? " " I know it is n't realistic to expect a child that age to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain it to him , and the cook  --  she seems like a kindly person  --  maybe she could help out  --  " " That is not what I meant . I 'm sure you believe that my fears about Pietro 's mental health are unfounded , and that he needs only a few simpleminded panaceas , such as a pet and a pat on the head , to be fully recovered . But what if you are wrong ? Twice he has tried to injure himself . When the next attack comes  --  and it surely will  --  he may injure somethingelse. "  |p127NATURALLY   --  NATURALLY !  --  I paid no attention to this depressing suggestion . I was waiting on the terrace when David drove up . He leaned across and opened the car door , and I climbed in next to the sleeping cat . " Here 's the loot , " he said , indicating a canvas carryall . " Cat food , medicine , the lot . Are you going to take him to Pete now ? " " Why not ? " " Can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laughing . The kitten woke when I picked it up . It was n't a beauty , but it looked a hundred percent better . We went into the house through the kitchen and stopped long enough to introduce the new resident to Rosa . She reacted as I had hoped , tickling it under the chin and giving us a saucer and a glass of milk to take up with us . David translated her comment . " It is a good house that has a cat . Better than mousetraps . " " Mice , " I said . " The place is riddled with them . Are you afraid of mice ? " " No . But I do n't like to find dead ones in front of my door . " " Better brace yourself . It 's a demonstration of affection , I 'm told , and this guy sure owes you . " I ca n't describe Pete 's face when he saw the kitten and realized it was for him . I still get choked up thinking about it . I managed to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not averse to more milk , so Pete fed it , and David explained the proper use of the things he had bought . " Do n't try to put the medicine in its ears by yourself , Pete . It 's a two-man job . Cats hate the stuff . " " O-kay . " Pete stroked the cat 's back . It tried to purr and drink at the same time , sneezed , spat , and rubbed its nosep128irritably . Pete laughed . " Is it a boy or a girl ? How old is it ? What is its name ? " " Boy , " David replied . " About six weeks old . You 're the owner ; what do you want to name him ? " Pete hesitated . Then he said , " Joe . His name is Joe . " " Namath ? " I guessed . " If you 're going to name him after a quarterback , there are other  --  " " Not a quarterback . Joe is what his friends call my father . His name is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call him in America . " " That 's a very good name , " I said , clearing my throat . " It is not bad , to name an animal for your father ? " " I think it 's a great compliment , " David said seriously . " Ihave a pig named after me . He 's a very handsome pig . " " I will call him Joe David , " Pete said . " I have two names , so he can have two names . I can not call him Kathy . He is not a girl . But when I get a girl cat or a girl dog ... " " That 's a promise , " I said . " Do n't forget . " " I picked up a few toys too , " said David , clearing his throat . " Ball , catnip mouse . Here 's some string ; what you do is , you tie something on the end and  --  " " I know . " Pete seized the string eagerly . " I know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I played with them . Like this . " He dangled the string . When we left he was laughing and watching the kitten pounce fiercely on the end of the string . It was the first time I had n't felt wretched about leaving him alone . Aunt Vera . His mother 's sister ? It had not occurred to me that he might have living relatives on that side of his family . The seed of an idea put up a tiny green tendril in my all-toofertilemind . " Hey , " David said . " We forgot something . " " What ? " " Litter box . "  | " Oh , lord , you 're right . Not that I care if the cat poops on the floor . Emilia will have to clean it up . " " I 'll dig up something , " David said . " Literally . " We parted with mutual expressions of esteem and a promise to meet next morning for football . David headed down the back stairs and I went the other way , to the front stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw Emilia ahead of me , about to start down . Where the devil had the woman come from ? She certainly had n't been with Pete , and there was no other reason for her to be on the top floor . I called to her to wait . I felt fairly certain she had been spying on me , or on the child . Some people are natural sneaks , and Emilia probably justified her prying and spying on the grounds that her mistress ought to know what was going on in her own house . It would have been pointless to accuse her , though . Instead I told her I was going out for dinner and asked what time she locked up . " You will be late , signora ? " she asked . " I do n't know when I 'll be back . That 's why I 'm asking . " " Naturalmente , I will not lock the house until the signora has returned . " I thanked her and went on down the stairs . Alberto must have told her about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my interference , but she did ; the sullen hostility in her eyes was now open instead of half-concealed . I wondered if she would put snakes in my bed or forget to clean my room . Probably not ; as long as I was on good terms with Francesca I was safe  --  hated but sacrosanct . All the same , I thought , I 'll look under the covers before I get in bed.  |p130SEBASTIANO  WAS picking me up at seven . I decided to wait for him downstairs . The idea of being summoned by Emilia and perhaps being invited to join Francesca for a drink before we left did n't appeal to me . I was trying to decide between a bare-shouldered sundress , in which I would freeze , and the inevitable brown suit , which made me look ten years older , when there was a knock on the door . " Who is it ? " I called . " Francesca . " " Oh . Come in , please . " I pulled the dress over my head as I spoke . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The zipper stuck as it always does when you 're in a hurry , and when Francesca came in I was squirming around , both hands behindmy back , like Laocoon fighting off unseen snakes . " May I ? " she asked . " Oh ; thank you . I 'm afraid it 's stuck . " It took her about two seconds to free the catch . I thanked her again , and tied the belt . She said nothing more , just stood watching me . I knew what she wanted , but  --  naive me  --  I put it down to curiosity , and her habit of authority . " I hope I gave Emilia enough notice  --  about not being here tonight , " I said after the silence had become embarrassing . " Yes . " She waited . It was against her principles to ask outright , but this time I was not going to make it easy for her . " It may be raining before you return , " she said finally . " Do you wish Alberto to drive you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks . " There was no sense in stalling ; he 'd be at the front door in less than half an hour . " Dr. Manetti is pickingme up . "  | " Manetti ! " I decided to go on the attack . " Is there something I do n't know about him ? Vicious habits , drunk driving , dead wives in the closet , like Bluebeard ? " She was not amused . She began , " Bart is  --  " " Bart is dead , " I said harshly . " Three months dead . I 'm sorry if your notions of propriety are offended , Francesca , but at home we do n't go in for formal periods of mourning and I find such observances hypocritical . You need n't worry , I 'm not going to ... do anything you 'd disapprove of . I only met the man two days ago . We 'll probably spend the evening talking about Pete  --  Pietro , I mean . " " That is your only interest in Dr. Manetti ? " " I 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very naive to believe me . He 's an attractive , interesting man . But I 'm not in the habit of jumping into bed with someone the first time I go out with him  --  or even the second time . " " I see . " Lines of worry scarred her forehead . She said , as if to herself , " There is no hope of dissuading you . I can give no reason ... " " I 'm afraid you ca n't dissuade me , no . I could meet him on the sly , but I 've no intention of behaving like that . " " I see , " she repeated . " Well , then . . . Perhaps it will be acceptable .... " And with that peculiar remark she walked out , closing the door softly behind her . I thought of another old adage : Just because you 're paranoidit does n't mean somebody is n't following you . What a strange interview that had been . It had n't occurred to me that Francesca might disapprove of a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , to be honest , it had occurred to me . I had thought she might not like the idea , but I had not realized it would matter so much . Yet she had seemed more worried than angry . Perhaps Manetti did have a bad reputation . The Florence Strangler ? The Marquis de Sade of Tus/cany ? I felt sure she 'd have told me anything to his discredit . I picked up my purse and my shabby old raincoat , which was all I had , and hurried down the stairs . I caught a glimpse of a black skirt whisking out of sight as I crossed the stairs . Emilia again . Damn the woman , I thought . How does she find time to get her work done ? Or is spying on me her chief job ? It felt good to get out of the house , even though the shadowswere closing in and the air was heavy with pent moisture . I had intended to walk to the gate , but after seeing how dark it was I decided not to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the best of surfaces for walking . He was early . I saw the headlights of his car appear and blossom into brilliance . They caught me full-on , and I put up a hand to shield my eyes . He was out of the car before I got over being dazzled . " What are you doing out here ? " he asked , handing me in . " It is dreary , chilly  --  " " The atmosphere inside was chillier . " I settled back into soft , gray velvet comfort . " Oh ? But I should have known . Was Francesca angry ? " " Not so much angry as upset . It does n't matter . " " She is difficult to understand , " Sebastiano admitted . " So sophisticated , so modern , and yet there are these pockets of traditional belief . I hope you were n't disturbed by her atti-tude . " " Is that a professional question , Doctor ? " He laughed ruefully . " It is a hard profession , mine . When I ask a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused of probing . When I do n't ask , I am thought cold and unsym-pathetic . " " You have a point , " I admitted . The big car  --  it was a Cadillac , brand-spanking-shiny new  --  went so lightly down the steep road that I hardly felt the bumps . A glare of headlights burst out at us , and Sebas/tiano pulled sharply to the right to let the oncoming car pass . He swore in Italian , and then said , " I hope you did n't understand what I said . He was coming too fast for such a narrow road . But you need not worry , I am a careful driver . " " I have a mild phobia about fast driving , " I said . " I do not ask why . " " Good for you . " He laughed ; then I could laugh too . I was much more relaxed with him than I had expected to be . After a moment he said , " If you do n't want to talk , that is fine . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any friend . And I wo n't send you a bill . " It began to rain as we passed through the village , a soft drizzle that barely moistened the windshield . He handled the big car expertly . I do n't remember what we talked about , but I remember that we laughed a lot . But it was not until we reached the restaurant , and we had checked our coats , that I really began to appreciate him . I had felt self-conscious about my off-the-rack cotton dress . Sebastiano was wearing an equally unimpressive suit , and his shirt was open at the neck . The other diners were more formally dressed ; I had to believe that Sebastiano had deliberately dressed down to my level so as not to embarrass me . The headwaiter greeted Sebastiano with the enthusiasm reserved for old and valued customers and we were shown to a table in a shadowy corner . I asked him to order for me . It was all superb  --  the wine , the food , the deft , unobtrusive service , the beautifully appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had with David . Plastic tablecloths instead of snowy linen , coarse white plates instead of fine china , a harsh , biting Chianti instead of  --  whatever this superbvintage might be . But the two men had one thing in common  --  the ability to make me feel relaxed and at ease , the ability to make me laugh . And if Sebastiano 's charm was practiced and professional , I could n't have cared less.  |p134I  refused dessert , though he urged me to have something . " You are too thin , " he said , his fingers tracing a line along the inside of my arm . " I speak medically , you understand . Does n't Francesca feed you ? " " Too well . Rosa is a good cook . " But there was a reason why I had enjoyed this meal more than usual . Every bite I took in that house stuck in my throat . I had not thought about it until that moment , but it was true . Breaking bread with another person has time-honored emotional connotations . Offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sign of trust . " You are thinking thoughts that are not pleasant , " Sebastiano said softly . " I do n't ask what they are . What shall we do to take your mind off them ? Would you like to go dancing ? " " I 'd rather not , if you do n't mind . " " I do n't mind at all . Although I am a good dancer . But not so good as your husband , perhaps . " I looked up from my plate . He clapped his hand to his mouth in mock consternation and then said , " I ca n't help it . Forgive me . " " You 're forgiven , " I said , laughing . " Bart did love to dance , and he was marvelous . He was an actor , you know ; every movement he made was trained , graceful . " " I did n't know . Francesca has spoken of him , but only of his childhood and adolescence . I am something of a movie buff ; I 'm surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He had had a few small parts in television shows , but most of his work was on the stage . " " Ah . New York ? " " Well . . . It was mostly summer stock , dinner theaters , that sort of thing . Luckily he had a private income or he 'd have starved . It takes not only talent , but contacts and luck , to break into the theatrical profession . "  | " True . " He waited a moment and then said tentatively , " If I were to suggest a film , it would not ... " " No , that would be fine . But my Italian is practically non-existent . " " There is a cinema that shows old British and American films . I do n't know what is playing , but we could go there and see . " The movie was an old Marx Brothers film  --  A Night at the Opera . Sebastiano had not martyred himself on my account ; he laughed so hard I thought he 'd choke . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He suggested a drink , or coffee . " I guess I 'd better not , " I said reluctantly . " Emilia will be waiting up for me . I ca n't stand the woman , but it is n't fair to keep her up half the night . " The streets were slippery . He had taken my arm ; now he gave it a squeeze . " You are a very kind person , Kathy . " My laugh had more than a touch of wryness . The gates were closed , but before Sebastiano could sound the horn Alberto came out from the lodge and opened them . The rain had slackened , but he got pretty wet . Sebastiano said , " Is your tender heart concerned for Alberto too ? " " I just wish the rain were boiling oil , " I said . " Dio mio , how vicious you are ! What has he done to deserve that ? " " Lots of things . I do n't understand why Francesca employs a man like that . " " His personal habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties faithfully . I believe he and his wife have been with her for years . It is hard to keep servants , especially when one does n't pay high wages . " He brought the car to a stop in front of the stairs . " Do n't come in , " I said quickly . " I 'm sorry , Sebastianothatsounded awfully rude ; I did n't mean it that way  --  " " It did not sound rude and I know why you said it . But I must see you to the door . "  | " It 's stopped raining . I 'd rather you did n't . Really . " " That bad , eh ? " He sat back , his hands resting on thewheel . " Do you mind if I smoke ? Will you join me ? " " And you a doctor , " I said . " It 's very bad for you . " " It is a bad habit . I try to cut down  --  it is my first of theevening , if you notice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it seemed boorish just to say thank you and leave after such a nice evening . " I have n't smoked since I got here , " I said proudly . " I do n't want to start again ; I was smoking too much for a while . " " How long has it been ? " " Since I quit ? Only a few days , actually . " " You know what I mean . And you know I am not asking as a doctor . " " Sebastiano  --  " " Six months ? A year ? " " Three months . " I choked on the smoke like a teenager with her first cigarette . " I did n't know . " " Francesca did n't tell you ? " " No . And that is not strange , for we do not talk of family matters very often . When she called to ask if I would see you she said only that you were her nephew 's widow . I was taken aback when I saw how young you were . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had no idea .... " " You would n't have asked me to dinner if you had known ? " " Oh yes , I would . " The answer was prompt and heartfelt . I laughed a little . Then I said , " Perhaps after all you share Francesca 's idea about the propriety of someone so recently widowed going out . " " I do n't make rules . All cases are different . In your case , it shows a healthy attitude . One can not mourn forever . " " How true . " I put out my cigarette . " I 'd better go in . " " Yes , the poor servants whom you hate so much will be kept waiting , " he said mockingly.  | " Thank you for a wonderful evening . I really enjoyed it , Sebastiano . " " Then we will do it again . Tomorrow ? " Before I could reply , he clicked his tongue and said irritably , " I forgot . I am going away for the weekend . Monday , Tuesday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to . " " Good . I will telephone . " He went on with scarcely a pause , " If I try to kiss you , will you consider it an affront to your hostess ? " I was laughing when he took me in his arms , and the kiss was more intense and prolonged than I had planned . It was n't at all like Bart 's kisses .... The fact that I could think of that , in the middle of a thoroughly satisfactory and enjoyable embrace , was not a good sign , but I did n't let it keep me from responding . Not until Sebastiano 's hands moved under my loosely belted coat did I pull away . " Right move , wrong place , " I said a little breathlessly . " Emiliais probably looking through the keyhole and Alberto is ticking off the minutes until you drive out . " " Since we will be blamed anyway , why not enjoy it ? " The first fine careless rapture was gone , though . I had a prickly feeling at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden , intense surveillance . Which was ridiculous . The lanternlights flanking the door of the villa were some distance away , and the interior of the car was dark . When I drew away the second time , Sebastiano did n't insist . I refused another cigarette . He lit his ; the flame trembled perceptibly . " Get out , then , " he said lightly . " You wo n't let me come to the door , you wo n't . . . Next time it will not be so easy for you to run away . " Despite the light tone and the smile that accompanied the words , I knew he was annoyed  --  at me , at Francesca , or at both of us . I did n't blame him . He waited until he saw the door open , and then pulled away with a roar of the exhaust.  |p138Emilia  had indeed been waiting for me . She had the door open before I reached the top of the stairs . I felt like an adolescent who has violated a curfew , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I crossed the terrace . The rain had stopped , but the wet stones were slippery . Emilia stood back with exaggerated deference , holding the door . I had barely entered the house when I heard it  --  a scream of tortured metal that seemed to go on forever , and a dull , crunching crash . For a few seconds I was frozen , flung back into a memory of past horror . But when I turned there was no flame , no column of smoke . I started to run . Emilia followed . I heard a voice call out : " What is it ? What has happened ? " The voice was Francesca 's . She had waited up for me too . I did n't pause to reply . The Cadillac was halfway between the house and the gates , where the drive curved . The hood was jammed against a tree trunk . The headlights still shone ; one went off at a drunken angle , shedding a weird theatrical light up into the leaves . I saw a man leaning against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thought it was Alberto , until the gatekeeper came running up , calling out . Sebastiano straightened . He spoke to Alberto , and then started violently as I caught his arm . I stammered out a series of questions , the conventional inquiries , to which he replied that he was unhurt . Francesca was the last to arrive on the scene . She had delayed to put on a coat and  --  with her usual good sense  --  to find a flashlight . She turned it on Sebastiano . He was pale and his hair was disheveled , but his face , at least , was unmarked . He insisted on inspecting the damage to the car before he did anything else . It might have been worse . One of the headlights was out of line and the hood was crinkled , butp139there did not appear to be anything wrong with the engine . I t would cost a pretty penny to repair the body , though . We went back to the villa , leaving Alberto trying to straighten the headlight . When Francesca got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have cracked a rib . You had better stay here tonight . I will call a doctor . " " I am a doctor , " Sebastiano said , with a forced smile . " It is not broken , only bruised . I was thrown against the steering wheel . " He refused her invitation to stay , or to let Alberto drive him back to Florence . Somewhat to my surprise she did n't insist . " But you should n't drive , " I protested . " Even if you are physically able , there may be damage to the brakes or the steering or  --  " He cut me short with uncharacteristic abruptness . " I will drive carefully . There is little traffic at this hour . Good night , Kathy  --  Francesca . I regret having inconvenienced you . " " It is I who should apologize , " she said expressionlessly . " The drive must be in poor condition . I will have Alberto look at it . " I do n't know how she managed in such innocuous words to convey the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be drunk , or drowsy , or distracted . I knew he was none of the above , but I could n't understand how it had happened . The drive was not in first-class condition . There were slippery spots where the gravel had been worn away , but only excessive speed would cause a car to skid out of control . Sebastiano kissed Francesca 's hand , wincing as he bent from the waist , and shook mine with ostentatious formality . His eyes avoided me . He telephoned an hour later , as Francescahad asked him , to let us know he had arrived home safely . Emilia delivered the message . He did n't ask to speak to me.  |p141WOKE  up sneezing . I had not caught cold ; there was a cat sitting on my face . Somebody giggled , and a voice said , " You have a mustache . A black-and-white-striped mus-tache . " I removed the cat 's tail from under my nose and sat up . The kitten slid down my front , rolled over , and attacked my knees . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first and hugged it protectively to his chest . " Joe did not mean to hurt . " " I was thinking about the sheets . " Ruefully I examined theperforated silk . " Your grandmother is n't going to like this . I 'm afraid Joe will have to have his claws clipped . " " Clipped ? " The silver-gray eyes widened in horror . " It wo n't hurt him . A scratching post might not be such ap142bad idea either . " I sank back onto the pillows , yawning . " You little demon , do n't you know that people who wake up their friends by putting cats on their faces are not popular ? " " But you sleep too late . Today we have the football , and also washing of David 's things . He said we could help . What do you call them  --  the things from the storeroom ? " " Darned if I know . " It had been late before I got to sleep , following the accident and its aftermath , but the beaming face that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was reacting to a Saturday off like any child freed from the appalling boredom of studies . " You have a mustache now , " I said . " Okay , buster , scram out of here and let me get dressed . I 'll be with you soonest . Am I allowed to eat breakfast first ? " A knock sounded at the door , and the boy 's face altered so unpleasantly I reached out a hand to him . Emilia came in before I could reply . " You are ready for breakfast ? " she asked . " I have  --  " Then she saw Pete , who had retired behind the bed curtains , and burst into a tirade in Italian . " I asked him to wake me , " I said sharply . " That will be all , Emilia . I 'll be down in fifteen minutes . " " The contessa has eaten an hour ago . I will bring a tray to you . " Pete did n't come out from his shelter until she had closed the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him . " Wait for me if you like . " " No , I will put Joe in my room . Then I will go to David . He is in his room , at the garage . You will come ? " " As soon as I can . " He scuttled out , clutching Joe . He did n't want to encounter Emilia again , even with me there to defend him . When I came out of the bathroom my breakfast tray was on the desk . For all her bulk Emilia could move quietly when she chose . I was n't sure I liked that idea.  |p143The  scientists were hard at work when I arrived . David had put his rags to soak . A row of trays filled with muddy liquid lay on the table . Pete was peering onto one of them with an expectant air that was , in my opinion , hardly justified . All I could see was dirty water . " Just in time , " said David . " The great unveiling is about to take place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He flexed his hand , reached into one of the trays , and came up with a fragment about a foot square . He dunked it in a tray of clear water to rinse it . " Voila . " The colors seemed to leap up off the surface of the water  --  bright crimson , clear green and buff against a background of rich dark blue . Careful stitching outlined a woman 's face and shoulders . Her features had the big-eyed stiffness of a Byzantinepainting , and her hair , of soft auburn , was surmountedby a fillet of twisted gold threads . A border of flowers and leaves framed the portrait . At least David claimed it was a portrait . " Fifth century if it 's a day , " he murmured rapturously . " And in perfect condition . " " What do you mean , perfect ? The stitching 's come undone here  --  " He stepped back with a look of horror as I put out my hand . " Do n't touch it ! " " I was just pointing . Goodness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been called worse . " David deposited his treasure tenderlyon a piece of blotting paper and went on to the next . The fabrics  --  some woven , some embroidered  --  had a certain charm , especially the squares and roundels with running animals  --  cats , hares , greyhounds  --  which , according to David , had been stitched to clothing . I found them mildly interesting , but only mildly , and Pete soon got bored . " Let us play football , " he said.  | " Do n't tell me you are n't having fun , " David said with a grin . " I like that  --  " His finger indicated the embroidered cat . " But to wash clothes , it is a woman 's work . " " Male chauvinist , " I said . " What is that ? " " Well . . . It 's like saying girls ca n't play football because they 're girls . " " But they can not . Except you , " Pete added . " You 'd better quit now while you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be through in a minute , Pete . Ca n't stop in the middle of a job , you know . How about getting rid of the used solution for me ? No , not out the window , you lazy cuss  --  in the sink . " He indicated the door behind him . " You 've got plumbing ? " I said , as Pete lifted the tray , spillingonly a quart or so . " All the comforts of home . This used to be the chauffeur 's quarters . Alberto being a happily married man , and Emilia being vital to the contessa 's comfort , they live in the villa . " I helped Pete empty the trays and rinse them . David refilled them with distilled water and mixed some assorted chemicals . " That 's the lot , " he announced , dunking the next batch of scraps . " Now we can get on to the important business of the day . " Pete had the football with him , of course . He clattered down the stairs ahead of us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Huh ? " " When I said you were an old granny I was being chauvinist . I apologize . You said  --  " " Oh , yeah . Think nothing of it , dearie . My old man had more pejorative comments to make when I took up my profession . He went so far as to impugn my masculinity , if you can believe it . "  | " What did he want you to do ? " " Follow in the paternal footsteps . He manufactures bolts  --  those fifty-cent bolts the Pentagon buys for nine hundred bucks . " " Oh . " Another stereotype gone west . The starving academicwas , or could have been , one of the idle rich . " A matter of principle ? " I inquired . " I do n't like bolts , " David said . Pete decided he wanted to practice kicking that morning . I let David talk me into holding , though I ought to have known better . Pete kicked my hand as often as he did the ball , so after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the honor of being the holder all the time , and David and I changed places . The sun was high in the sky before Pete could be persuaded to stop . I reminded him that Joe would be waiting , and he gave in with reasonably good grace . " To take a nap is not so bad with Joe , " he admitted . " Joe must sleep lots , he is young . " After he had gone I dropped onto the bench . David sat beside me . " Nap ? " he said . " He 's too old for an afternoon nap , is n't he ? " " I would say so . But his grandmother has some idea he 's delicate . " " Delicate , my foot . " We had ended the session with some passing and tackling . David had been tackled . " Is that why he is n't in school ? " " I guess so . " I felt sure David 's question was n't prompted by idle curiosity or love of gossip . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's emotional problems . " This is a lousy setup for a kid , " David muttered . " He 'd be better off in school . Has n't he got anyone to play with ? Not even a pet , until you came up with the kitten . " " I 'm working on it , " I said briefly . David 's wide , Petrouchka smile split his jaws . " I 'll bet you are . Little Miss Fix-It. "  | " I 've been called worse than that . " " By your old man ? " " Especially by him . You 'd like him , " I added after a moment . " Maybe I 'll look him up when I get back . " " When will that be ? " " June , July  --  whenever the money runs out . " " Oh . " " Any chance that you 'll be there ? " " At home with the folks ? That depends on the job situation . If I can teach summer school I will ; I need the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother and father , and sling hash at the local diner . " " Then you wo n't be here ? " " Not on your life . I  --  " His eyes shifted , but not quickly enough . I glowered at him . " Who have you been talking to ? Rosa ? " " I was not prying into your personal affairs , if that 's what you 're thinking . Rosa volunteered the information . She 's all excited about it . " " Damn , " I said . David went on , " She keeps talking about what joy it will bring to the house when the baby is born , and all like that . I got the impression you were going to stay until . . . that you were going to stay . " " No . " " I did n't mean to  --  " " I do n't want to talk about it . " " Okay . " He stood up . " See you . " After he had marched off , visibly offended , I regretted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now public knowledge , and it was n't his fault if Rosa liked to gossip . I could not imagine Francesca chatting with the cook ; presumably Rosa had heard the news from Emilia . I should have known it would happen . It didn'tp147alter the situation , but somehow the fact that David was now one of the deluded majority brought the whole dubious businessinto sharper , uglier perspective . I had been kidding myself when I thought I could prolong the lie for another month . Every day brought the possibility of a painful confrontation that much closer . If Francesca asked me flat out I would have to tell her the truth . When the situation first arose she had been a stranger to me , a stranger I did n't much like . Now she was a person I knew , with feelingsthat could be hurt . I might not sympathize with those feelings ; I could n't even say truthfully that I was fond of her . But when I thought of seeing her face change , her eyes harden with contempt  --  no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soon . I had done all I could for Pete ; Lord knows it was n't much , but there was n't much I could do except talk . And I had done plenty of that . As I showered and changed I rehearsed the speech I meant to make to Francesca : graceful thanks for her hospitality , apologiesfor remaining longer than I had intended . Then she would say something like " Not at all , it was a pleasure . " And I 'd say , " It 's been great getting to know you , but ... " But I have to get back to my job ? But my mother broke her leg and she needs me to take care of her ? But I feel another nervous breakdown coming on ? No . That was my guilty conscience thinking I needed an excuse to leave . What I needed was an excuse for barging in and staying so long . A polite hostess does n't ask a guest when she is planning to go . Maybe my cynical and melodramatic theories about the matriarch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe she would be glad to see the last of me . I revised the dialogue . " Thank you so much for your hospitality , Francesca . " " Not at all . I 've enjoyed having you here . " " I 've enjoyed it too . But I 've trespassed long enough . "  | " I 'm sorry you must go . When are you leaving ? " " The end of next week . " The end of next week . Set yourself a deadline and stick to it . Do n't let an unhappy child or a handsome doctor stop you . The only trouble with pre-planned conversations is that the other guy never says what he 's supposed to say . I went downstairs early , wanting to get it over and done with . Francesca was not in her sitting room . I paced the floor nervously , picking things up and putting them down . Bart 's photograph followed me with smiling eyes . I tried not to look at it . I heard the telephone ring . The instrument was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want such an intrusive , modern vulgarity in her lovely room , where she might have to answer it herself instead of letting Emilia screen the callers . The door opened . " It is a telephone for you , signora , " said Emilia . It had to be Sebastiano . Who else would be calling ? I picked up the telephone and said brightly , " How 's the rib today ? " There was a moment of silence . Then a voice said , " Which one ? I 've got eleven or twelve of the cursed things . They seem to be all there , but I 've better things to do than ask them how they are feeling . " " Pa ! " " So you know me , do you ? But you were n't expecting the old man , oh no . Whose ribs was it you were inquiring about so sweetly , may I ask ? " " Oh , Pa , it 's so good to hear your voice ! How did you find me ? " " With great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even on a Saturday , so do n't be wasting my time in idle chatter . "  | " Who 's wasting whose time ? How are you ? Is everyone all right ? What 's wrong ? " " Nothing is wrong here , " said my father with heavy significance . " It 's yourself that must be wrong , I 'm thinking , to foist yourself on a poor woman who never saw hide nor hair of you till you turned up on her doorstep . What the devil are you up to ? Never mind ; do n't tell me , I do n't dare think about it . When are you coming home ? " " Soon , Pa . Did you get my letter ? " " What letter ? I got a postcard with a dozen words on the back , and thank you for the effort . When I telephoned your hotel I had a very strange conversation with a young man who seemed to know more about your affairs than your own father . When is soon ? " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat broke , is it , without the means to buy a ticket . " " For God 's sake , Pa , I 'm not eighteen years old . I have my return ticket  --  " " Then use it . When ? " " The end of next week . " " You mean it ? " " Yes . Friday or Saturday  --  maybe Sunday . I 'll call as soon as I get a reservation . Honest . " " Humph , " said my father . " Let me talk to Ma for a minute . " " She 's not here . " " I 'll bet she does n't know you called . I 'll bet she said , ' Leave the girl alone and do n't be treating her as if she was a baby . " " Humph . " " I adore you , Pa . I 'll call you in a few days . " " You damn well better , " said my father . I heard the click as he replaced the telephone , more thanp150five thousand miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday . I 'd try to get on a plane Friday . Then I looked up and there was Francesca on the stairs , staring down at me . I said stupidly , " That was my father . " " So I gathered . " She came down the stairs . " I apologize . I could not help overhearing . " She walked right past me toward the door of her room . Emilia materialized in time to open the door . I followed , though my first cowardly impulse had been to flee . We took our seats . Emilia poured wine . I said with forced brightness , " He 's mad because I 've been gone longer than I planned . As you may have heard , he wants me to come home . " " Friday or Saturday , you said . " " If I can get a reservation . I 've trespassed on your hospitalitylong enough . " I was back on track . Unfortunately she failed to pick up her cue . " I had assumed you would stay on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what gave you that impression . I have n't any  --  " " You are Bartolommeo 's wife . This is his home . It is yours , for as long as you like . " A faint frown wrinkled the serenity of her brow . " Perhaps I should have made that plain from the beginning . I assumed you would understand . " Worse and worse . She was talking to me the way she would to a simpleminded child . And the kindness , the openheartedgenerosity ... Do n't be a boob , I told myself . It is n't generosity . It 's the old European assumption that a woman is her husband 's property , to be moved from place to place at his convenience . That his child belongs to his family , not his wife 's . " You are very kind , " I stammered . " But I must go home . My  --  my mother ... "  |p151I  verily believe I would have dragged out that stupid lie if she had not interrupted me . " Ah yes . You want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take her place at such a time . It would be different , of course , if Bartolommeo were here . " " Oh yes , of course . " By that time I did n't know what I was saying . I snatched at the excuse she had offered . " That would be different . But as it is  --  " " Friday ? " " If I can get a reservation . Do you mind if I call this after-noon ? " " Emilia will place the call for you , " she said abstractedly . " The telephone system is difficult . " My appetite was n't very good . Francesca did not raise the subject again , but I expected her to at any moment , and my stomach was a mass of fluttering butterflies . It did not improvematters when Emilia came in with a long white florist 's box , and Francesca held out her hands , and Emilia said dourly , " For the signora . " I had to open it then and there . The flowers were freesias , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow , smelling of springtime . The card said only , " Until Tues-day . " Francesca murmured , " How charming . Give them to Emilia ; she will take them to your room and put them in water . " Emilia took the flowers with a curl of the lip that indicated what she thought of the gift , the giver , and the recipient . No doubt the conventional red roses would have impressed her more ; but these soft , fragrant blossoms were more to my taste . That Sebastiano knew they would be  --  that he was n't annoyed with me  --  improved my mood considerably . I told Francesca I would let her know about the reservation . She only nodded , without speaking . I was on my way out of the room when I thought of something . " Francesca ? " " Yes ? "  | " I 'd appreciate it if you would n't tell Pietro I 'm leaving . I suppose it 's vain of me to think he will care  --  " " He will care . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway , I 'd rather tell him myself , if that 's all right with you . " " Certainly . " She smiled . " I have not given up hope of persuading you to change your mind . " WELCOME BACK , Jane Eyre , I thought . But that was just my neurotic conscience reacting to what had only been a courteous conventionality . Coming from a sinister housekeeper , or a villain twirling his mustache  --  or the scarred , brooding hero of Bride of the Madman  --  it might have sounded like a threat . I decided to go to Florence . It was a beautiful day , a good day for shopping and sightseeing , and a very good day for avoiding the members of the household . There was n't a single person I could face . I had even been rude to David . The flowers were in my room , filling the air with their sweetness . I grabbed my purse and coat and went out . Emilia was in the hall when I got downstairs . The damned woman was everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be in to dinner . I could n't endure another meal like the last . There was no one in the stableyard , no sign of life at David'swindow . No doubt he was in his beloved dusty attic . It felt good to be behind the wheel of a car again . If no other positive feature had resulted from this visit , that phobia at least seemed to be cured . The car represented freedom , independence , mobility , escape .... From my own folly , what else ? When I reached the gates , they were closed . Alberto wasp153nowhere in sight . No reason why he should be on duty ; he had not been told I was going out . I got out of the car . There was a bar on the inside , but after I had hoisted it out of its supports the gates still would n't open . I pushed and tugged without result , and then looked more closely . There was a lock . There was a keyhole . There was no key . Surely Alberto would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd have to go back to the garage and look for him , and I was averse to that idea for more reasons than one . I heard something moving in the shrubs behind the lodge . I called , " Alberto ? " and went around the shrubs to have a look . The man behind the bushes was n't Alberto . He was on his hands and knees , crouched like a beast of prey . Locks of greasy flaxen hair fell over his face ; and as I stood watching he began crooning to himself . I took a grip on my nerves . The poor man could n't help it if he looked like a creature out of a horror film . I did n't know his name . I said slowly , " Pardone , signore . La porta a chiusa. lo desidererei ... " I could n't think of the word for key . He did n't look up . He started crawling back and forth , snuffling like a dog on a scent . It was really a ghastly performance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Scusi  --  " That was as far as I got . The man sprang to his feet , arms flailing wildly , and ran straight at me . I caught a flashing glimpse of a face twisted by some strong emotion  --  fear , perhaps . His eyes were shut , his mouth was an open , gaping hole in his face . He passed within a foot of me and rushed on , limping dreadfully , but moving at surprising speed . A harsh cackle of manic laughter drifted back to me . I finally found the key hanging on a nail inside the lodge door . It was eight inches long , and I had to use both hands to turn it . Then I had to return the key to its place , drive out the gates , get out of the car , close the gates . I could n't lock them . I decided that was just too damned bad . Why all thep154fuss about security , anyway ? Barred gates , a vicious killer dog , a surly brute of a human guarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pawnshop .... The green shadows of the tunnel-like road reminded me that I might be unfair to Francesca . The house was certainly isolated . For all I knew , the quiet countryside might be a hotbed of vice and crime . Perhaps she needed the dog and the gates . As soon as I came out of the trees my spirits improved . Under the spring sun I saw the lovely smiling landscape I knew from photographs and paintings . The hills were flushed with the pale green of new growth ; the dark gray-green shapes of the cypresses looked like an ornamental frieze , too symmetricalto be natural . The small piazza in the village was crowded  --  women shopping , or pushing baby carriages , men filling the tables at the outdoor cafe . I drove at a crawl , responding to the friendly nods and smiles and the curious stares of passersby . What a pity my visit had been spoiled by personal difficulties  --  mostof them , I had to admit , brought on by myself . Someday perhaps I could return . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never forgive me when she learned the truth . I forced Francesca from my mind . This was my afternoon off . I was going to play tourist , shop for souvenirs , see the sights . I had not much time left . Five days , or six . I had forgotten one little detail until the clerk at American Express reminded me of it . Yes , I could get on a flight from Rome on Friday , if I was willing to pay an extra hundredplusdollars . My ticket was an excursion-type , with a minimumnumber of days . If I wanted the lower rate , I would have to wait until Monday . Luxurious living had n't blunted my thriftiness . What was a couple of extra days , after all ? I made a reservation on ap155train to Rome Sunday afternoon , and another on the Rometo-NewYork flight Monday . There were lots of flights from New York to Boston ; I would n't need a reservation for that leg of the trip . That job done , I turned to the important business of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours in the Uffizi or the Pitti Palace . I wanted to go shopping . Many of the shops were closed ; they would reopen later in the afternoon . But the open-air stalls in the Piazza San Lorenzo were doing a thriving business , and I bought presentsfor everybody  --  a real leather purse for Ma , a silk shirt for my father ( he would n't wear it , but he would brag about owning one ) , toys for the baby , souvenirs for brothers and sister-in-law  --  and a dress for me . I intended to dazzle Sebastianoon our next  --  our last  --  date . The dress was peachcoloredsilk with a jacket trimmed with braid of the same fabric . My souvenir of Florence . Later in the afternoon I found myself in my old neighborhood and decided to stop for a cappuccino at the coffee bar near the hotel . I had n't been there long when Angelo came in . I invited him to join me . He glanced doubtfully at the table and the chair and I said expansively , " I 'm buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of my life . " " Signorina ? " " Just a figure of speech , Angelo . " " Ah , " said Angelo . He looked to my right , to my left , and then , for reasons known only to himself , over my head . " The friend is not with you . " " No . " " The friend is gone ? My brother  --  " " I 'm sure your brother is very nice , " I said . " But I wo n't get a chance to meet him this trip . I 'm going home soon . " " He is handsomer than your friend , " said Angelo . " Your friend is nice fellow , but not handsome . You are going home ? " " I have to work for a living too , Angelo. "  | " Ah yes . You have more secret letters for me , signorina ? " I thought of telling Angelo I was not a secret agent or an undercover cop , and decided there was no need to disillusion him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment , Angelo . But I appreciate the offer . " " Prego , signorina . I am always ready . I am always at your service . A secret message , a room , if you wish to be private , no one knowing where you are ... " " I may take you up on that , " I said . He swallowed two cups of espresso in quick succession and then announced he had to get back to work . " Any time , signorina . Remember . You take advantage of me . " It was nice to have a friend , even if he liked me for the wrong reasons  --  as did most of the people I had met recently . Angelo thought I was a spy , Francesca thought I was pregnant , David and Sebastiano ... I had not been completely candid with them either . They might not like me as well if they found out what I was hiding . Thank heaven for Pete . Pete liked me . That thought did n't cheer me up one bit . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left in a public parking lot . I could n't return to the villa yet . I had told Emilia I would not be in to dinner . It was too early to eat , but the shops had reopened . I still needed a gift for my hostess , and I wanted something to read . Perhaps I could find a book for Pete too . Secondhand paperbacks books in English . I had no idea at what level Pete was reading , so I avoided the heavier classics and settled for the Hardy Boys , a book about cats with lots of color photographs , and one real prize  --  a book called Famous Quarterbacks of the NFL . I felt sure he 'd struggle through that text , even if it was too advanced for him . Sometime later I was unconcernedly lost in a maze of nar/row streets behind the Duomo . The narrowest were no wider than sidewalks , and here , for the first time , I began to get the feel of the medieval city . The houses were flush with the pavement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archways . There were a few jarringly modern touches ; through the open windows came , not the gentle tinkling of a lute , but blaring rock ' n ' roll , from radios whose volume switches had been turned up as far as they would go . I wandered along , pressing against the wall when a motorbikeroared past . Then I saw something in a shop window , illumined by a ray of sunlight that had squeezed through a gap between the high buildings opposite . It was a scrap of embroidery that looked as if it had been cut from a larger piece . A spray of silvery-green leaves and pale-pink flowers curved across a background of ivory silk . The flowers were shaded with such skill that the individual stitches blended , like a painting . On a sudden impulse I opened the door of the shop and went in . I had tried my hand at the bargaining I knew was customaryin the smaller shops , without much success ; but I did not have to counterfeit the consternation that seized me when the genteel lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is Lyon silk embroidery , signorina , over two hundred years old . Very rare . " " It 's just a scrap , " I protested . " Not even big enough for an evening bag , or  --  " She looked shocked . " One does not use such rare pieces , signorina . One exhibits them . It is a manufacturer 's sample , not a scrap ! " I got it for a little more than half the price she had originally quoted , only because I did n't really want it and she knew I did n't really want it . I was almost out the door when she made her final offer . As I filled in traveler 's checks I was already regretting my purchase . I must have embroidery onp158the brain ; without David 's lectures and Francesca 's attempts to instruct me , I 'd never have noticed the wickedly expensive trifle . And Francesca would probably consider it a tacky , inappropriategift . IT WAS dark when I got back to the villa , and as I drove into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That surprised me ; I had expected he 'd be out on the town on Saturdaynight . I was unloading my purchases when I heard his door open and the clatter of feet down the stairs . " Hi , " he said tentatively . " Hello . " " Are you still mad at me ? " " No . I was rude , David . Sorry . " " That 's okay . Hey , you really went on a shopping binge , did n't you ? Let me take some of those things . " " I should have bought a shopping bag . They do n't give  --  " The paperbacks I was trying to balance slipped and fell . David bent to collect them . I had left my headlights on ; he examined the books as he gathered them up . One cover was particularly lurid ; I seem to remember it featured a decapitated head with tongue protruding and eyeballs rolled up till only the whites showed . " Tsk , tsk , " David said . " Your taste in literature is deplor-able . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the back door David said , " Pete was looking for you . " " I did n't tell him I would see him this afternoon . " " Why so defensive ? I know you did n't . He 's lonesome , that 's all . He seemed upset . " " Thanks so much for telling me. "  |p159David  opened the last gate and we went into the kitchen garden . " There 's a carnival in Fiesole tomorrow . We could take the kid . " " What an irresistible invitation . " " Are you sure you are n't still mad at me ? " David asked mildly . " Damn it  --  " He cringed in mock terror as I turned on him , and I had to laugh . " Sorry again . I 'm not in a very good mood , I guess . I 'd love to go to a carnival , and I know Pete would get a kick out of it . I 'll check with Francesca to make sure it 's all right . " After a moment I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He opened the kitchen door . The room was dark except for a flickering bluish-white light that came from a small television set on one end of the long kitchen table . Beside it sat Rosa , a bottle and glasses in front of her . She called out a greeting in Italian , then saw me and lumbered to her feet . David flicked on a light switch . " So this is how you spend your evenings , carousing with Rosa , " I said . " Tell her to sit down , for goodness ' sake . And give me those books ; Francesca would have a fit if you took them upstairs . " He handed them to me . " Do n't worry , I know my place . Sure you wo n't join us for a nice lowbrow evening ? You have n't lived till you 've seen ' Dallas ' in Italian . " " Each to his own lowbrow tastes , thank you . I prefer to wallow in crime and in chocolates . Have one ? " He shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had returned to her seat and was watching me somewhat warily . She accepted a piece of candy and crunched it between her teeth with such relish that I put a handful of it into a dish . " I can see you 're a fellow chocolate fiend , Rosa . " David translated , and Rosa 's face broadened into a grin . She nodded vigorously . " Grazie , signora  --  motto grazie . " I patted her on the shoulder . " Enjoy yourselves . Buona notte , Rosa . Good night , David . "  |p160Before  I so much as closed the door they were deeply involved in the drama . The screen blurred and flickered , but it did n't seem to bother them ; Rosa shook with laughter at some quip of J. R. 's and nudged David . I was tempted to stay . They looked so comfortable  --  so happily lowbrow , like me . The house was quiet and deserted . I barely saw Emilia 's apron fluttering around a corner . I had to shift my parcels to turn the doorknob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the bed , reaching it just in time to spill books and parcels onto its surface . Then I jumped back with a gasp . My fingers had touched something wet and slimy . There was a lamp on the bedside table , but I wanted to get as far from the foul thing as I could . And I had thought I was being morbid when I speculated about snakes in my bed ! I found the light switch by the door , and pressed it . It was n't a snake . It was the mutilated remains of my pretty flowers , crushed and torn , oozing sap like blood from their broken stems  |p161MY  ANGER was n't of the speechless variety this time ; I swore at some length , using several expressions of which my father would not have approved . ( " Big as you are , do n't think you can use swear words in my presence , young lady  --  and it 's no lady you are to say such things . " ) Francesca had disapproved of my going out with Sebastiano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulgarity . It was worse than vulgar , it was obscene . The flowers had been so fragile and pretty . They had been not only crushed , but wrenched and ripped by hard , spiteful hands . I was sure the hands had been Emilia 's ; but was it Francesca who had prompted the destruction ? Like Henry the Second and Thomas a Becket  --  " who will free me from this turbulent priest ? " I could n't leave the mess , it was smack in the middle ofp162the velvet spread . I cleared it away , but it left a disfiguring stain , like the stain of memory in my mind that could never be forgotten . The fit of rage on top of an active day and little sleep the night before left me exhausted . I got undressed and climbed into bed with my pile of books and my chocolates and my carafe of water on the table beside me . Eating chocolates always makes me thirsty , and I intended to eat every last one of them . The water had looked stale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I rinsed it out and refilled it . The nice proper English detective story or the decapitated head ? I sorted through the pile , trying to decide , and realized I had acquired an extra book . As soon as I saw the title I knew how it had got there . Collected Poems of Robert Browning . David must have brought it down with him intending to give it to me , and sneaked it into the pile . What a nut he was . I tossed it aside and opted for the detective story . Decapitatedheads were too suggestive of my murdered flowers . But the detective story was dull , and by the time I had eaten my chocolates ( filled with peculiar combinations of liquor , nougat , and marzipan ) I decided I did n't care who had murderedLord Billingsgate . The only Browning I could remember reading was My Last Duchess . It had been a requirement one year in high school . I had hated it . At the time I did n't understand why I hated it ; it takes a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Duke . As I leafed through the book I found other familiar lines that I had n't known were Browning 's . " God 's in his heaven , All 's right with the world . " Says who , Robert Browning ? With a little snort of laughter I recognized the line I had overheard the first day I met David . " My scrofulous French novel , On gray paper with blunt type . . . . " Poor Brother Lawrence , in his Spanish cloister ! I remembered David saying that the Brownings had lived in Florence . I must ask him to show me the house , if itp163was still standing . Although I had never had much use for Robert , I had adored Elizabeth , especially the sloppier , superromanticsonnets . " How do I love thee ? Let me count the ways . " Robert must have had some good qualities to inspire those words . Actually , he was n't such a bad poet himself , I decided after a while . I read " Andrea del Sarto " and " Fra Lippo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florentine painters  --  skippinga lot , because the poems were awfully longwinded . There were some good lines , though . The ending of " Fra Lippo Lippi " rather caught my fancy ; the old rascal is on his way back to the monastery after an unclerical night on the town when he is stopped by the watch . " No lights , no lights , " he begs . " The street 's hushed and I know my own way back . Do n't fear me ! There 's the grey beginning .... " I wished I could be sure I knew my own way back . I had taken the first stumbling steps , but the end of the road was lost in darkness , without any sign of the gray light of dawn . When the sounds woke me it was the dead , silent center of the night . The moon had set ; faint starlight delineated the window . The sounds were coming from inside my room . The hair on the back of my neck lifted as I listened . I sat up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor just inside the door . Both hands clutched the leg of the chair in a grip that whitened his knuckles . His pajamas stuck to every fragile bone ; they were soaking wet , as if he had stood under a shower . The sudden burst of light dilated his pupils to black , hiding the silver-gray . He forced one word out of his distorted mouth . " Help ... " I ran to him and scooped him up bodily . His bones felt like the hollow bones of a bird , and waves of shivering ran through him . " Pete ! For God 's sake , honey , what is it ? What happened ? " " Do n't let them . . . " His teeth were chattering so violentlyp164he could n't get the rest of the word out . His crooked fingers dug into me like the kitten 's claws . " Do n't be afraid . I wo n't let anybody do anything . It 's all right . . . . " I went on crooning meaningless words of reassuranceas I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the blanket . Luckily I was still holding him when it happened . Every muscle in his body went into a spasm , hardening like wood . The hands that had clung now struck out at me . His flattened palm cut a stinging slash across my cheek . At first I thought he was having an epileptic seizure . Then I saw his face , and reeled , almost losing my hold , as his fist smacked into the side of my head . We fell onto the mattress , with me on top . My body pinned his arms to the bed , but he continued to struggle , writhing and kicking with an unnatural strength . I must have outweighedhim by fifty pounds , but I could barely hold him down . That was all I could think to do , and all I could manage  --  holdhim , keep him from hurting me or himself , until the attack passed . But every now and then I could have sworn that something flickered behind the eyes that were narrowed with rage  --  something frightened and bewildered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . The fit passed as suddenly as it had erupted . His eyes closed . I thought he had lost consciousness , and was about to shift my weight when his dark lashes fluttered . He whispered , " Are they gone ? Are they gone ? " " There 's nobody here but me , " I said , fighting to keep my voice calm . " Signora ? " " Yes . It 's all right , honey . " His lashes stuck together in wet points . I rolled over and took him in my arms . " It 's all right . Everything is all right now . " It was n't all right , though . He could n't look at me . He risked one quick glance , and then scuttled on hands andp165knees to the farthest corner of the bed , where he huddled against the headboard with his hands pressed to his eyes . When I tried to touch him he let out a thin mewing scream , like a rabbit cornered by hounds . Sometimes , during that long night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to move . It was still dark outside when at last he ventured to open his eyes . I was sitting as close as I dared , ready to grab him if he went into another convulsion . But it was over  --  whatever it was . His chest rose in a sharp sigh . " Signora . " " It 's me . " His arm lifted , with painful slowness . I took his hand , but that was n't what he wanted . His fingers squirmed free and reached for my face . They traced every feature , as a blind person might . He could see , though . His eyes were focused and aware . " It is you , " he said . " I am very sleepy , signora . " " Me too . Get under the covers . You can stay here the rest of the night . " He rubbed his eyes fretfully . " No . I must be there , in my bed . I must see where Joe is . " My heart gave a painful lurch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck at the kitten as he struck at me . . . " Okay , " I said . " I 'll carry you . " I could n't manage it . He was too heavy and the stairs were too steep . We staggered up them together , leaning on one another . His door was closed but not locked . The kitten was nowhere in sight . Pete went straight to the wardrobe and opened its door , to be greeted by a reproachful yowl . Like a true philosopher Joe had whiled away the hours of his imprisonment by sleeping . He rose in one of those fabulous stretches only felines can achieve , back arched , tail stiff . Pete dropped to the floor . " He is safe , " he murmured . " Joe is o-kay . They did n't . . . " He fell asleep sitting there . I caught him as he swayed andp166lifted him onto his bed . With a businesslike air , Joe headed for the lifter box . I found dean clothes in a drawer and changed Pete 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping child . His lashes lay soft on his cheeks . I had to lift him to get his arms into the pajama top . His eyes opened a slit . A smile curved his lips . " I came to you , " he murmured . " I did it . To you . " I spent what was left of the night lying on the rug by his bed . Joe kept me on the qui wive , walking up and down my body and nibbling my hair . Not until the room grew light did I get stiffly to my feet . The child was deeply , peacefully asleep , the cat curled up against his back . Through the barred window I could see the cypresses taking shape against the gray dawn . " There 's the grey beginning .... " But not here . Not in this room . I DID N'T expect to sleep , but I did , instantly , like someone who has been hit over the head . From the angle of the sunlightstreaming in when I woke I knew it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got out of bed so fast my head swam , and I had to sit down for a minute . Finally I opened my door and looked out . The house was as silent as a tomb , but Emilia must have been waiting for me to show signs of life , for she appeared instantly . " You are awake , signora . You wish breakfast ? " " Please . Where  --  where is everybody ? " " Alla chiesa , signora . " Her expression and her tone implied that I should have been at the chiesa too . I could n't have cared less what she thought of my devotional failures . I said , " And Pete  --  il conteishe at church too ? " " Si , signora . Naturalmente. "  |p167I  closed the door , practically in Emilia 's face , and collapsed into the chair . Naturally it conte was at church . Naturally . Then he was all right . He was functioning normally . No one had noticed anything wrong . I sat staring at my bare feet until Emilia came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my wits . Could I have dreamed the whole ghastly episode ? My aching muscles deniedthat comforting solution . There were bruises on my shins , where he had kicked me , and a tenderness behind my ear . It had not been a dream . But how could a child go through an attack like that and be fully recovered in the morning ? If Francesca was to be believed , there had only been two comparableepisodes , weeks apart . Had there been others she did n't know about ? Other times when he fought it alone , locked in his room , or sought help and comfort from .. . From whom ? " I came to you , " he had said . He had known it was coming . He had shut the cat in the wardrobe , so it would n't be hurt , and struggled down the stairs to my room . I hardly need say that by that point in my meditations the tears were streaming down my cheeks and dripping into my coffee cup . I wiped my face , wincing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand had hit me . I knew I must tell Francesca . I knew it , and I had no intention of doing it . I should be ashamed to admit that , even in the light of what happened later . It was nothing less than criminal negligence . But I could not bring myself to betray the boy . That was the word that stuck in my mind  --  betrayal . He had come to me , with God only knew what effort and courage . What would Francesca do if she knew what had happened ? Lock him in his room , increase the dosage of the drug he was taking  --  the same old remedies , only more of them . I could n't see that her methods were proving particularlyeffective . It was a strange coincidence that his door had not been locked last night . But coincidences happen . Someone hadp168forgotten , that was all . Thank God , thank God , he had thought of me . Thank God he had come to me instead of .. . I was leaving in five days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too salty to drink . I reminded myself that the situation had not changed . He was no worse than he had been before I arrived on the scene . He might even be better . Relapses were only to be expected . It was consummate egotism on my part to think that my half-baked therapy would restore him to perfect health overnight . Things like that happened in movies , not in real life . I would talk to Sebastiano  --  really talk to him , not exchange compliments . That was all I could do , except make the next few days as happy as possible for Pete . And then walk away clean , jeered my conscience . What the hell can I do ? demanded my common sense . I 'd take him home with me in a second if I could . I ca n't . I have no right . My conscience had no answer to that one , but it was n't satisfied . I could feel it rumbling unhappily , like an empty stomach . An empty conscience is much more uncomfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their arrival was heralded by an altercation in the hall  --  Pete 's shrill voice , and Emilia 's growl . I rushed to the door . She had him by the arm , although he was n't doing anything except arguing . He looked like a child model for an expensive catalog  --  shirt and tie , polished shoes , three-piece white linen suit . " What 's going on ? " I asked . " I wanted to see if you were awake , " Pete said . " I told him he must not disturb you , signora . " " You knew I was awake . Let go of him . " " Si , signora . As you desire . " The look she gave me did n't match her submissive reply . She walked away . He looked tired . There were dark stains like bruises underp169his eyes . He looked at me shyly from under his fantastic lashes . " I dreamed of you last night , signora . " " Did you ? What did you dream ? " It was hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me another long , measuring look and then shrugged . " It was a funny dream . I do n't remember . Will we do somethingtoday ? " I threw caution and common sense to the winds . " How would you like to go to a carnival ? " FRANCESCA AGREED to my request that I be allowed to take Pete to the carnival , but expressed some concern that the crowds might be too much for me . She had heard there was a great deal of pushing and shoving at such affairs , coarse language , rude overtures to young women ... . I could almost hear Jim and Michael howling with laughter . After Celtics and Red Sox games , with beer bottles , fists and epithets filling the air , I felt sure I could cope with a carnival crowd . I explained that David was going with us . Francesca nodded approvingly . " Yes , he will do very well . I will see that he is suitably rewarded . " As I withdrew from the presence I told myself I must repeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amused . Not to my surprise I found David hanging around the kitchen . Rosa was baking  --  some variety of crisp little brown cakes that smelled divine  --  and he was eating them almost as fast as they came out of the oven . " You sure took your sweet time , " he said when I walked in . " Is Pete  --  " He broke off , staring . " That bad ? " I said . " You look like the morning after the night before . "  | " Your gallantry is remarkable . I did n't sleep well . " " Hm . " " We 're all set . " I handed him the car keys . " I 'll collect Pete and meet you out in front . " Excitement had made Pete so hyper he did n't notice how tired he was . We ate the most awful , indigestible combination of food  --  " American hot dogs , " which did n't taste like hot dogs , but some variety of sausage  --  slabs of pizza , lemonade , soft drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stalls and rides were typically tawdry affairs , but the carousel was wonderful  --  real old wooden horses , the kind they put in museums in the States , lovingly repainted and gilded . I had forgotten there would probably be a carousel . By yelling and sliding around on my horse and generallymaking a spectacle of myself , I managed to keep from waxing sentimental ; and if Pete was reminded of his mother he kept his feelings under better control than I did . There were n't any giraffes or elephants or lions , just horses . Some white . I went bravely on a couple of the rides , the kinds with little cars that bump into each other or swoop sickeningly around a central pole , and then I copped out . David gave me a meaningful look when I said wanly that I would prefer to sit down for a while , but he did n't say anything . Pete did not want to leave , of course . He whined and complained like any rotten , normal youngster until David said equably , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete grinned . " Would you ? " " Sure , " David said . " O-kay , " Pete said . He was sound asleep before we had gone a mile , curled up beside me with his head on my lap . " Now you can tell everybody back home you saw the sights of Fiesole , " David said . " It 's a popular tourist spot . " " What else is there besides a carnival ? "  | " Nothing much . A famous cathedral , with frescoes by Rosselli , tomb sculptures by Mino da Fiesole  --  boring stuff like that . " " Oh well . Any woman of sense would prefer roller coasters and diseased hot dogs . " " We could go back this evening . Have a quiet dinner someplace , stroll in the piazza under the light of the moon . " " David , I ca n't . I 've been a rotten guest ; tonight is my night for being polite to my hostess . " " Some other time , then . " Within another mile I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first thing my sleepy eyes saw was Alberto opening the gates . It was not the most auspicious welcome . I had been able to conquer my forebodings during the horseplay and activity of the afternoon . Now they came back in full measure , and I had to keep telling myself I was being overly protective . There was no reason to suppose that another attack would follow so close on the last , or even that they inevitably occurred at night . When David stopped to let us out , the front door opened . Emilia was there ; and she was n't the only one . David muttered , " Oh , oh , here it comes , " as Francesca 's slim , erect figure crossed the terrace and descended the stairs . But she was smiling . " Did you enjoy yourself ? " she asked . Pete nodded . He never spoke to her if he could help it . He was certainly no advertisement for the quality of my childcare : crumpled , sleepy and sullen , spotted with various foodstuffs . Francesca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said dryly . " Thank it professore and the signora and go with Emilia . You will sleep well tonight . "  | " I do n't know whether he 'll eat his supper , though , " I said , watching the small , stiff figure ascend the stairs . " I suppose an occasional orgy of self-indulgence is good for all of us , " Francesca said . " I came to thank you personally , Professor , for your kindness . Please join us for cocktails this evening . " I gathered she considered that the suitable reward she had mentioned . It sounded more like an order than an invitation . David said meekly , " Yes , ma'am . Thank you . " " Seven o'clock . " She dismissed him with a gesture only slightly less brusque than she used for Emilia and Alberto , and turned away . David winked at me and rolled his eyes in pretended awe . Francesca waited for me at the door to make sure I did n't linger to chat with the help . I told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll turn my car in at the station , " I explained . " So Alberto wo n't have to drive me . " " Whatever you like . " Her remark about persuading me to stay on had been only a meaningless courtesy after all , and my apprehension had been groundless . " You see ? " whispered the shadow of Sister Ursula . " Honesty is the best policy . Now if you will tell her about the other ... " Shut up , Sister Ursula . When I went to my room I found a surprise waiting for me . The vase had been placed near the window and the setting sun struck full upon the flowers , making them shine like carved garnets . Not rubies ; the roses were deep , deep red . There was no card . If they were an apology , they were n't good enough . If they were a reminder , they were a piece of damned impertinence . I moved them to a dark corner and collapsed on the bed for a nap . Prompt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p173Iwashed  , brushed , and properly clothed . I hoped David would be the same , and I also hoped he would be able to restrain his irreverent sense of humor . He was on time , at least . Francesca and I had exchanged only a few words when he appeared , escorted by Emilia . It would have been hard to say which of them looked grimmer . I studied him in exasperation . He was clean  --  but neat ? That depends on how you define the word . From the remains of the once-gaudy scene plastered across the front of his T-shirt I deduced it was a souvenir from one of our national parks . Much of the color had washed out , but I could see the shape of a mountain . Francesca wasted no time . " How is your work progressing , Professor ? " " Oh , fine . Great . I 'm finding all sorts of things . " " What sorts of things ? " There was a slight edge to her voice . David looked terrified . He had selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he perched uneasily on its edge , knees together , holding his glass of wine as if he were clutching a beer can . The pose and the expression were so exaggeratedlyawkward  --  the country bumpkin in the china shop  --  that I suspected he was putting on an act . " Uh , " he said . " Well , er . ... I 've been working on the Egyptiancollection . So far there 's nothing particularly interesting except the Coptic embroideries . " " Embroideries ? " A spark of interest warmed her face . David expanded . " The Copts were Christian Egyptians . They used embroidery on robes and clothing for the most part , sometimes for cushions and wall hangings . The survivingpieces date mainly from the third to seventh centuries , though some are as old as the first century A.D. The dry climate explains why so much survived .... " He rambled on , sounding as stiff and dry as a textbook , until Francesca cut him short . " I would like to see them . "  | " Oh ? Oh , sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . It 's a slow process , you have to use special chemicals and distilled water and let them dry  --  " " How long will it take ? " I did n't blame her for interrupting , since he appeared prepared to continue talking till someone stopped him ; but I was a little surprised at her peremptory tone . David blinked . " A few more days . There 's another crate I have n't opened , and it might have  --  " " I 'm afraid that whatever you are working on will have to be finished by the end of the week , " Francesca said . " More wine , Professor ? " " Uh  --  thanks . " " I am going away for a while , " Francesca explained . " The house will be closed . " My astonishment was scarcely less than David 's . She had not mentioned her plans to me . A wild and horrid suspicion flashed into my mind . Surely she would n't pursue me and the apocryphal embryo into the wilds of western Massachusetts . Francesca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duration of your stay indefinite . I had no plans at that time , but now the situation has changed . I hope it does not inconvenience you , Professor . " " Yes , yes  --  I mean , no . I mean  --  whatever you say , of course . The end of the week ? " " That will give you time to finish whatever you have begun , " she said complacently . " And you will let me know when the embroideries are ready for display ? " " Oh , sure , " David said bleakly . She let him finish his wine , and then eased him firmly out the door . I knew that if I did n't find out what she was planning I would n't get a wink of sleep that night . My uneasy consciencep175might even drive me into premature flight . Sneaking down the stairs at midnight , shoes in hand ; hitching a ride to Florence ; appealing to Angelo for a room , secret , no one knowing I was there ... . With Machiavellian subtlety I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfering with your plans . If you want to get away earlier , I can easily stay at a hotel for a few days . " " That is not the case at all . The idea did not even occur to me until you told me you were planning to go home . " That was n't reassuring . I abandoned subtlety . " Where are you going ? " She answered readily . " I have n't decided . Switzerland , perhaps . Or Austria . Paris is impossible these days . " I felt so lighthearted with insane relief that I dared make a joke . " Too many American tourists ? " " Too many tourists , " she corrected , unsmiling . " I have no prejudice against Americans , Kathleen . I know several who are very pleasant . " " Some of my best friends . . . " I did n't speak the words aloud ; her sense of humor was n't exactly uproarious . A new worry penetrated my selfish euphoria , and I said , " What about Pete ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daresay I would have put my foot in my mouth and asked what arrangements if she had given me time . She pressed the bell , saying pleasantly , " I hope you did n't overindulge in carnival food . Rosa has prepared one of my favorite dishes tonight . " At home we 'd have called the dish a seafood casserole , but the seasoning and the delicate wine-flavored sauce made that term too commonplace for such a culinary masterpiece . Francescawas in an excellent mood ; she even made a few dry , cynical little jokes . We were finishing dessert , another heavenlyconcoction consisting primarily of raspberries andp176whipped cream , when she said , " It is good of you to take such an interest in Pietro , Kathleen . You have strong maternal instincts . " I wanted to get her off that train of thought . " He 's a very nice kid , " I said . " You would like to see him again , in the future ? " " Yes , very much . " " We must see if that ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursing a pleasant little secret . I excused myself early , saying I was tired , and for once I was telling the truth . It had been a long day and a longer night . Instead of going to my room I went on up the stairs to the top floor . I expected Pete would be asleep by that time , but when I put my ear to the door I heard voices , so I knocked . A voice I did n't recognize  --  a woman 's voice  --  answered in Italian . I assumed she was telling me to come in , so I did . It was the tuttofare . I had forgotten her name . She was sitting on the bed watching Pete toy with the contents of a tray lying across his legs . When she saw me she got quickly to her feet . " Hello , " Pete said , sounding pleased . " I was sick . " " You were . . . Oh . I 'm not surprised . Eating all that junk food , and then the roller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete said , making a graphic gesture . " The pizza , the hot dog , the gelato  --  " " Never mind , I get the picture . Only too clearly . " " So now they say I must eat this . " He scowled at the bowl on the tray . It appeared to contain some pale substance like mush . " I do not want it . " " I do n't blame you . Is it as bad as it looks ? " " Try . " He offered an overflowing spoon . " I will if you will . " The tuttofare giggled as we finished the mush , turn and turn about . It did n't taste bad , or good . It did n't taste at all . When the bowl was half empty I said , " That ought to be enough . Is she waiting for the tray ? "  |p177The  boy 's eyelids lowered . " Always she waits . " No knives , no glasses that could be broken . . . I gestured at the girl . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoketo me . " She asks if you stay here ? " Pete translated . " Yes . Si . " The girl started to speak , then broke off with a nervous laugh . " She wants , " said Pete , " to tell you to be sure to lock the door . " It was n't the girl 's fault . She was just obeying orders . I dismissed her with a nod and a stiff smile . Pete got out of bed and opened the door of the wardrobe . Joe emerged , tail high , whiskers indignant . " She made me put him there so he would not eat the food , " Pete explained . " Get in bed and I 'll tuck you in . I 'll bet you 're tired . " " Yes . It was a good day . " Joe thought the tucking-in process was a game for his benefit . He pounced on my hands and rolled himself up in the blanket . His antics cheered us , but I kept thinking of that damned key , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the bed I said , " I wo n't lock the door if you do n't want me to . " " I want you to . " I could n't see his face , except as a pale oval beyond the limited circle of the lamp . " Are you sure ? " " Yes . And , " he said , " please take the key . "  |p179CALLED  Sebastiano the following morning to thank him for his flowers  --  and for other reasons . The nurse informed me he would not be back until Tuesday . I thanked her and hung up without leaving my name . Just as well , I told myself . I knew  --  how well I knew !  --  that it was difficult to talk with psychiatrists during working hours . I had a lot to talk about . I needed plenty of time and Sebastiano 's undivided attention . We had a date for dinner Tuesday . It was only one more day . One more night . Francesca was working at her desk when I joined her for breakfast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when one is preparing to leave for an extended period . One of the things I would like , Kathleen , is to show you something of the city . What do you say to a thoroughly frivolous view of Florence  --  shopping , hairdressers ? "  |p180I  had never seen her look so young and carefree . She 's probably happy at the prospect of ridding herself of the woman who came to dinner , I thought . " I guess I need a beauty shop at that , " I said , smoothing my flyaway locks . " My hair needs cutting . " " Only trimming and shaping . You must n't cut it short ; it is beautiful hair . " " I 'd love to go to Florence with you , " I said , tactfully avoidingthe question of how to style my hair . " Let me take you to lunch . " " You are my guest . Today ? " " That would be fine . " After breakfast I left Francesca working on her lists and wandered out onto the terrace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flowers jumping up out of the ground . My fingers itched for a trowel . I love gardening , though I have been accused of not being able to tell a weed from a flower , and one of the charms of my little house on the hill had been its minuscule garden . I looked at my hands . They had become white and soft over the past months . A lady 's hands . The sight of Alberto 's unfortunate assistant languidly at work on the front flower beds killed any lingering ambitions at horticulture I might have had . It was n't his fault he was a pitiable creature , but he made me nervous . I had returned the key to the lock of Pete 's door early that morning , just after daybreak . I had not been able to resist a quick look inside . He was sound asleep , curled awkwardly around the cat , who was , in the manner of cats , lying in the precise center of the bed . I decided to go up and extract him for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever he had in mind . He had no doctor 's appointment that day , and it would n't hurt him to miss an hour of such schooling as Francesca provided.  |p181His  face lit up when he saw me , and I concluded I would postpone telling him I was leaving for another day . He was n't studying ; the heavy Italian history book lay significantly crumpled against the wall and he was playing with Joe , pullinga string to which a piece of paper had been tied . " Shall we play football now ? " he greeted me . " You really ought to be studying . Oh , the heck with it . It 's too nice a day to stay indoors . " " Shall we find David ? It is better with three . " " He 's probably in his room washing rags , " I said , rememberingFrancesca 's ultimatum . " We could stop by and see if he has time to play . " Joe would have been happy to accompany us . A wail of frustration arose when we closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not let him go out . I am afraid he will run away . " " You 're a good pet owner , " I said approvingly . " David has told me . When an animal is young it does not have good sense , David says . There are many dangers here . Cars on the road , wild animals in the woods , or even ... " He did n't finish the sentence . I had not told him about Alberto and the dog , for I felt it was too grisly a tale for a child . Either David had hinted at potential danger from the animal , or Pete was perceptive enough to have figured it out for himself . He went on , " And also , David says , it could climb a tree and not know how to come down . Is that true ? If a cat can climb up a tree , why ca n't it climb down a tree ? " I explained the physiological mechanism involved , as I understood it , and added comfortingly that most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not tell him about a feeble-minded feline we had once owned , who really did n't know how to climb down . We 'd once left him up the big sycamore in front of the house for three days , hardening our hearts to his shrieks after all efforts to entice him down had failed . Ma insisted he 'd come down when he got hungry , butp182even she was relieved when Michael finally shinnied up , at extreme risk to life and limb , and retrieved old Bill . Pete and I stood in the stableyard and yelled for David . At last his head appeared at the window . " What a racket ! " he said . " Why did n't you come up ? " " We thought you might be busy , " I said . " Besides , it is more fun to yell , " said Pete . " True . Are n't you guys early today ? " " It is too nice a day to stay inside , " Pete informed him . " True again . I 'll be with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was glad of the interlude because it gave me a chance to ask the boy some questions . I had been puzzling over that enigmatic comment of Francesca 's  --  that she hoped I would have the opportunity to see Pete again  --  and a possible explanationhad occurred to me . I sat down on the bench , and Pete rambled around kicking at the ball . " You said something about your Aunt Vera , " I began . " Yes . She is the sister of my mother . You go over there and I will kick the ball to you . " " In a minute . " I caught his arm and pulled him down beside me . " What 's her name ? " " I told you . Aunt Vera . " " Does n't she have another name ? " " Oh , yes . It is a funny name . It is Hassel-berg . Her husband is Uncle Ben Hassel-berg . " " Where does she live ? " " In America . " Pete began to squirm . He wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I finally pinned him down . Aunt Vera and Uncle Ben lived in or near Philadelphia . " That is where I went to school , " Pete said . " Phila-delphia . I had to remember the number of her house , if I was lost . "  |p183Aunt  Vera sounded like a sensible woman . I wrote down the address and the name . Then I said , " You were living with Aunt Vera when you were going to school in the States ? I thought it was a boarding school . " " You mean where you live in the school . I did live there . But I went to Aunt Vera on holidays and on the week endings . " He was silent for a moment , remembering . His eyes were wistful , his mouth had a sad little droop to it . " I liked it with Aunt Vera and Uncle Ben . My cousins were older , but on the week endings they played with me sometimes . Evan ( he pronounced it with a long e , Ee-van ) was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a basketball star . And when Uncle Don came , in the summer , he was going to teach me baseball . He was a baseball star , when he was in his school . And Aunt Vera let me play with the cats and the dogs , and Bruno was there , and I was going to be a cub . " I assumed they had n't offered him a position on the Chicagoteam , so I suggested , " Cub Scout ? " " Yes . They wear clothes like soldiers . " " The eternal male animal , " I said . " What ? Oh , there is David ! David , hurry , we are ready . " He leaped up to greet his receiver and I sat pondering what he had told me . It was only a hunch , but I thought I understood why Francescahad equivocated when I had asked her about her son 's will . He may or may not have had such a document , but I seriously doubted that he had meant Francesca to be Pete 's legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy in an Italian school , near his grandmother , so he 'd have a relative close by in case of illness . Instead they had picked a school near his mother 's family . After the death of the boy 's parents , Francesca had taken Pete from the Hasselbergs . Had they agreed , or had she simply scooped him up and walked out with him ? Possession is nine tenths of the law , and it would be difficult to extradite a child from a foreign countryp184if the person in charge of him was a close relative , and a distinguished citizen of the country in question . As yet I had no proof of this theory , but it gave me an idea with which to calm my indignant conscience . The minute I got home I would look up the Hasselbergs . If Pete had been taken from them against their wishes , and if they were willing to fight to get him back , I would help them . It might not be necessary . Francesca 's hints could be interpretedas meaning that she intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps she had acted on impulse , not realizing what she was letting herself in for . Finding the boy a burden and a nuisance , she might be willing to let someone else take over . I surpassed myself at receiving that day . Even Pete was impressed . " Someday you may play quarterback , " he promised . " After you have practiced some more . See , you hold the ball like this , with the laces so ... " He had the theory down pat , though his hands were too small to encompass the girth of the ball . He remembered his cousins ' lectures on sports word for word , though he could n't seem to get a grip on his history lessons . Not uncharacteristic of boys of any age or nationality ; some of my worst students could reel off statistics of prehistoric games played long before they were born , including such crucial details as Bronko Nagurski'sheight , weight , and yearly stats . Before we finished the game the skies had clouded over and a cool breeze was chilling my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said David , with the dour satisfaction some people display when announcing bad news . " Darn . I guess you always expect the sun to shine when you 're on vacation . " " The weather has been very unusual , " said David pontifically . " Usually it rains cats and dogs all through April and May . Innocent travelers think of Italy as sunny and semitropical , but the northern parts have the same climate as  --  "  | " It feels like home , " I agreed , shivering . " Come on , Pete , we 'd better get inside . You 're perspiring and I do n't want you to catch cold . " " If you two are bored this afternoon you can come up and help me , " David offered . " I 've got a lot of work to finish before I  --  " I shook my head warningly . The boy scampered ahead , and I said in a low voice , " He does n't know we 're leaving . I do n't want to tell him until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her ladyship has n't deigned to inform you ? " " Not yet . " " That 's strange , is n't it ? " " Not at all . The decision is hers , and she 's not accustomed to discussing her plans with other people . " " Hm , " said David . I read that noncommittal sound correctly . " Look , I 'll find out . If she does n't tell me , I 'll ask . She is n't used to children . She does n't realize they have to be carefully prepared for dramatic changes in their lives . I get the impression she 's planning it to be a surprise  --  a treat  --  so it must be something he 'll like . " " The contessa 's idea of a treat may not coincide with the kid 's , " David said dryly . " I said I 'd find out . " I added pointedly , " Even though it really is n't any of my business . " " Or mine ? " " You 're a nosy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? I 'll talk to Francesca this afternoon . We 're going shoppingin . . . Good heavens , we 're going shopping ! I 'd better hurry and change . " " Wear your raincoat , " was David 's parting shot . It rained , heavily and persistently , all afternoon , but I did n't need my raincoat . Money and status can even protect you from the weather . Alberto drove us from place to place and parked smack in front of the door , in flagrant violation of thep186traffic signs  --  to which nobody in Florence seemed to pay much attention anyway . When we had to cross a foot of open pavement he unfurled a big black umbrella and escorted us through the danger zone . Instead of enjoying this , I wanted to grab the umbrella and close it , lift my face to the cold rain . We lunched exquisitely and leisurely in a small restaurant that made the place Sebastiano had taken me to look like a slum . I think it was a private club ; Francesca was greeted like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise the subject of Pete 's future , for there were always at least two waiters hovering . The next stop was at Francesca 's hairdresser . It looked more like a medical clinic than a beauty shop . A grave middleagedman with the manners of a diplomat inspected me ; he and Francesca engaged in serious , low-voiced debate while I sat feeling like a patient who has delayed treatment too long . " If you had only come to me six weeks ago , madam , I might have been able to save your leg . " I got the impression the two disagreed , though I could not follow the rapid speech . Finally the diplomat threw up his hands . Francesca smiled at me and vanished into the adjoining cubicle . When she had gone I had the nerve to tell the diplomat I wanted my hair cut short . Apparently he did n't understand my vigorous gestures . He left it shoulder-length in back , shaking his head firmly when I pantomimed the use of the scissors . I had to give up . The result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out . She looked exactly the same as she had when we entered , every hair in place . I guess that was the idea . When I reached for my purse her hand closed over mine . " Please allow me to deal with this , Kathleen . " It 's vulgar to argue about money in some circles  --  not mine  --  but this was not my ambience , so I gave in . But atp187the next stop I forgot my manners when I realized what she was up to . The place was a dress shop . I did n't identify this function at first , for the room resembled a beautifully appointed salone , with not a garment in sight . After we had seated ourselves , a series of young women emerged , to posture and stroll , displaying the clothes . I like clothes . I mean , not just as methodsof avoiding cold and damp and getting arrested ; I like pretty clothes . I had never seen anything like this display . Even my uneducated eye observed the genius of line and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were absolutely sensuous  --  wools soft and light as silk , silk shimmering with imprisoned light , pure linen , even a few humble cottons  --  for scrubbing floors , I presumed  --  but they were the sleek , fine cottons I associated with names like Libertyof London . I enjoyed the novelty of it so much that it took me a while to notice that the women were all about my age and my size , and that the garments did not resemble Francesca 's tailored conservative tastes . She consulted me as the parade went on ; I thought she was asking my opinion for herself . Then she said decisively , " The apricot suede suit , I think  --  that is a good shade for you  --  the blue linen , the amber silk , and the velvet coat . " " Francesca , " I said . " Fittings are so tedious , I know . But it must be done today , if the clothes are to be ready by the weekend . " " No . You . . . Your generosity overwhelms me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  " " I am not making you a gift , Kathleen . " She paused just long enough to let a furious blush of embarrassment drench my face , before going on . " As Bartolommeo 's wife you are entitled to whatever your position requires . " Such a thing had never occurred to me . Bart always hadp188enough money for what he wanted , but when my father , acting for me , checked out the assets he had owned at the time of the accident , they consisted solely of a few dollars in a bank account and the small insurance policy that had paid for my trip abroad . I stammered , " You mean his father  --  " " I will explain it later . Please go now and try on the clothes . If there are any others that appeal to you ... " She went into the dressing room with me . So did the fitter and the owner of the establishment . I could n't go on arguing in front of that audience . The process dragged on interminably . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wondered what the devil I was going to do . It was out of the question for me to accept such a munificent gift ; I could only dimly imagine how many million lire the collection would cost . No wonder Francesca had n't invited any of her friends to meet me  --  except the doctor , for obvious reasons . Probably she was ashamed of the way I looked . The suit needed few alterations . Francesca indicated an almost invisible pucker across the shoulders and pointed out that my waistline was half an inch higher than that of the jacket . To me it looked like a perfect fit . I had never tried on an outfit like that , much less owned one . The sight of my image in the mirror sent not one but a few dozen cracks across the surface of my resolve . Maybe there was family money owed Bart . Why should n't I take Francesca 's word for it , especially since she was determined that I should ? I still had n't decided what to do when we left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fatigue and proposed a cup of tea . " I hate fittings , " she confided , girl to girl . " But it is necessary . These will do for you to go on with . " On with until when ? I wondered . Till I visited my favorite couturier in Paris or New York , to pick up my summer wardrobe ? At any rate , the fittings proved that Francesca had abandoned her fantasy about my being pregnant . She couldp189count as well as I could . The clothes she had just ordered would n't have fit for more than a few weeks , if I had been expecting a baby . Nobody , not even a spoiled aristocrat with more wealth than her run-down living quarters had suggested , would blow a small fortune on clothes that would be outgrown in a few weeks and outdated next season . Would she ? It did n't matter . The important thing was that she had accepted my imminent departure without argument or hard feelings . Had she something on her conscience that had prompted the expensive gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense wealth which she had usurped , in her role as Pete 's guardian ; an aristocratic lover waiting impatiently in the wings for the trespasser to go  --  to be bribed , so she would not be tempted to change her mind ? The first was pure fantasy , but the lover was entirely reasonable . Francesca was still relatively young and more than relatively attractive . Perhapsthat was where she was going , to meet it principe or monsieur le comte , or Graf von and zu something , in a Swiss hideaway . Speculations of this sort kept me preoccupied during the drive home . Francesca was silent , apparently wearied by the effort of selecting clothes , and the view was nothing to brag about in the rain and lowering fog . Mist veiled the dripping tree trunks and swirled in ghostly patterns among the brush . It was pleasant to come in from the dull twilight and the damp air to find a fire burning in my fireplace . I looked forward to a quiet evening with my books . When I went down to dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francesca . I was tempted to bury it in my suitcase ; it seemed so paltry an offering , especially now . " It 's not the gift , it 's the thought behind it , " I quoted to myself  --  my mother , not Sister Ursula , though the latter would undoubtedlyhave agreed . At any rate , Francesca appeared pleased . I expected shep190would express her thanks graciously , but her reaction was a little warmer than that . She pointed out some of the technical excellences of the stitching and assured me that examples of that kind of work were increasingly rare . " I must start a collection , " she said , smiling . " With this and the Coptic embroiderythe professor has discovered , I have a good beginning . " She was in such a charming mood I ventured to bring up the subject I had neglected all day . " Have you decided yet what plans you will make for P-Pietro ? " I got the Italian name she preferred out with only a slight stutter . " I have thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for such people . " That had an ominous sound . " Yes , but where ? " I said . She frowned a little at my peremptory tone , and I added , " The reason I ask is that I know of several excellent schools in the States for children with emotional problems . It occurred to me that you might be thinking of sending him back to his aunt  --  " " His aunt ! How did you hear of her ? " " Pete  --  Pietro told me . Of course I do n't know anything about his mother 's sister or her family ; they might not be the proper people to take charge of him , even temporarily . But if you had thought of sending him home  --  to the States , I mean  --  I could take him . That would solve one difficulty for you , would n't it ? " Her forehead smoothed out as I recited this speech . She listened attentively , nodding from time to time . " You would be willing to have him with you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Such arrangements can not be made quickly . " I was tempted to ask why she had n't begun them , then . " I could stay on  --  as long as you like . " The corners of her mouth twitched as if she were trying not to smile . I felt myselfp191flushing . " That sounds as if I 'm looking for an excuse to prolong my stay , does n't it ? Honestly , Francesca  --  " The smile came into the open . Her eyes shone with amusement  --  moreamusement than my blunder warranted , in my opinion , but if she was enjoying herself , who was I to complain ? Actually , I was pleasantly dazed by her reaction to my admittedly high-handed suggestion . I was n't accustomed to having people respond so amiably to my attempts to run their lives for them . She must be really desperate to get rid of the child . " You need not explain , " she said . " The suggestion certainlyhas a number of positive aspects . Suppose you let me think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision ? " I liked the delicate touch of irony with which she invested the word " we . " " Of course , " I said quickly . " It 's your decision . I only wanted  --  " " I understand . I appreciate your concern . " She did n't refer to the subject again , but I hoped I had made an impression . Now the trick was to leave her alone and refrain from nagging . What a marvelous solution that would be  --  not only for me , selfish creature that I was , but for the boy . He could n't be worse off than he was here . He 'd be with a family , with people who cared about him . And I could see him sometimes . When I went up to his room there was no sound within . The door was locked . After only a moment 's hesitation I removed the key and took it with me.  |p192ANOTHER  NIGHT safely passed , I thought , as I crept back to my room in the gray dawn , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the lock . Only a few more nights to go . If Francesca wanted me to stay on I would , but I could n't see why it would take long to arrange for Pete 's return . He must have a valid passport ; it had been used within the past year . Communication with his aunt and uncle was only seconds away , thanks to the telephone . Maybe we could make it by Sunday after all . Four more days . I refused to think about the alternative  --  catching my plane as I had planned , leaving him behind . I was so excessively charming to Francesca at breakfast I 'm surprised she bothered to add sugar to her coffee . I did not protest about the clothes , even when she coolly informed me that I had an appointment for a final fitting on Thursday . I did not mention my date with Sebastiano . I 'd have canceled that  --  anything to make Francesca think better of me  --  except for the fact that I wanted to talk seriously to Sebastiano about Pete . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be responsible for him , even for a few days . I even  --  " The Good Lord curse you for a hypocrite , Kathleen Alice Malone "  --  I even brought my embroidery down and asked Francesca to straighten out the mess I 'd made of it . She removed the faulty stitches and showed me where I had gone wrong . " I 'll never be any good , " I said dismally , watching her deft fingers . " If you do n't care to do it , of course you must not . But perseverance and practice will bring skill , and I assure you it is a restful activity . Good for the nerves , " she added , her head bent over her work . The almost-colloquialism of the comment surprised me , asp193did the sentiment itself . Good for whose nerves ? I wondered . Hers ? She did n't appear to have any . She ordered  --  I suppose I should say asked  --  me to bring the wretched scrap with me that evening , so we could work on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be there that evening . Assuming that eventually she would inspect the product to see what I had accomplished , I put in a tedious hour pricking myself and taking out more stitches than I put in . I knew the theory , but practice was n't having any discernibleeffect on my lack of skill . When I tossed the damned thing aside I saw that it had stopped raining . The skies were still swollen with clouds ready to release their burden , and a stiff breeze was blowing ; the tops of the cypresses bowed and curtsied . I got my coat and went up to extract the prisoner from his cell . It would do both of us good to get out . If I could persuade him to practice kicking instead of tackling , we would n't get quite so wet . I was surprised to find Emilia with the boy , stuffing him into an assortment of outdoor garments that would have been more appropriate for a winter day in Montana . " He must have the fresh air , " she informed me , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knit cap and the scarf covering his mouth Pete 's eyes blazed with rebellion . " Oh , I agree , Emilia . A little wet never hurt anybody . You run along . I 'll finish  --  er  --  dressing him . " She obeyed , shutting the door with a slam . Pete snatched off the scarf and threw it on the floor . " Eevan never wears a scarf . Even in the snow . " " You do n't need it , " I agreed . " Have n't you got a lighter coat ? " The coat followed the scarf onto the floor . " I will not wear a coat ! It does not snow . " I found a light jacket of waterproof material in the wardrobe , and we compromised on that . The cap would have gonep194the way of the scarf and the coat if I had not agreed to wear its mate . It was too small for me , and I had to tie it on with a babushka . My appearance sent Pete into spasms of laughter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Joe emerged from under the bed ; obviously he had been avoiding Emilia , which only went to show what an intelligent animal he was . He dragged the despised scarf into a corner and began chewing it . Pete was all for that , but I explained wool was not good for cats , and took it away . " He 's really getting handsome , " I said , stroking the sleek fur on his neck . " A few more weeks and he 'll be fat as a tub of butter . " " I comb him every day , " Pete said proudly . " And catch the fleas . That is fun , to catch the fleas . They pop when you squeeze them . " We sneaked out the door while Joe was investigating a ball Pete had tossed under the bed . Pete gravely rattled the door to make sure it was latched . He was taking his responsibilities seriously . The kitten had been a godsend . I had hoped it would entertain him  --  I had n't thought of the fascination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those other desirable attributes our school psychologistkept talking about . ( I do n't disagree with the theory , but sometimes I get awfully tired of professional jargon . ) The boots made a satisfying clatter on the stairs . Pete went up and down a couple of times while I contemplated a problemI had overlooked , the problem of Joe . Pete would kick up a fuss if he had to leave the cat behind , wherever he was destined to go . And he 'd be right to fuss . You do n't teach a child responsibility by allowing him to discard a living creatureif it becomes an inconvenience . I had no idea what formalitieswere involved in transporting an animal across the Atlantic . There was no six months ' quarantine in the States , as there was in England , but Joe would probably need shots and a certificate from a vet . The ticket was no problem . I would happily shell out for Joe 's ticket.  |p195You  see , I had already assumed that Pete and I would be leaving together . Optimism is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work . " It 's wet out , " he protested like a little old lady . " A little wet never hurt anybody , " said Pete , who had a memory like an elephant 's for convenient cliches . " Why do n't you come up here and help me ? " " I helped you before . It is boring , " said Pete , dancing up and down with impatience . When David appeared with a shabby windbreaker as his concession to the chill air , I said , " Your work is n't going well ? " " The damned scraps wo n't dry in this weather , " David grumbled . " I promised her ladyship a show tomorrow , and I ca n't use artificial heat , it warps the fabric . " " Too bad , " I said . " Ha , " said David . " Come on , " called Pete . We concentrated on kicking and going out for passes , but we got pretty wet all the same . Once or twice a feeble ray of sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly vanquished . Thanks to the boots and the jacket , Pete did n't get too soaked , but his pants were drenched , since he kept falling down in dramatic , unnecessary lunges for the ball . I called a halt earlier than I would otherwise have done and sent him in . " Ask Rosa for a cup of cocoa , or something hot , " I suggested . " She 's probably baking , " David added encouragingly . " She said she meant to this morning . " Pete ran off , promising to save a few cookies for us . " Come up and have a cup of coffee , " David said . He had a small electric heater . We sat in front of it and steamed gently while we drank our coffee . It was instant , and tasted awful after the espresso I had become accustomed to drinking . But it was hot.  | " Any news ? " he asked , after a while . " What about ? " " Your imminent departure . Are you really leaving this weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What about Pete ? " " I 'm working on it . " " Oh , you are , eh ? You look awfully pleased with yourself . What have you been up to ? " " I ca n't tell you till I know for sure . But I am pleased . I think  --  I hope  --  something nice is going to happen . " " Nice enough to make you forget your recent bereave-ment ? " The abrupt brutality of the question took my breath away . He went on in the same savage voice , " You do n't look like a grieving widow . What was he like , this husband of yours ? Handsome , intelligent , sexy  --  " " All those things . " I slammed my cup down on the table and stood up . " How dare you ! " " Wait . " His fingers wrapped around my arm as I spun toward the door . " I 'm sorry , Kathy . Sit down . " I had very little choice in the matter . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the angry contempt had left his face . " Forget I said that , will you ? You must know why I said it . " " Innate boorishness , I assume . Let me go . " " Not until you 've heard me out . When you showed up that first morning I could n't believe my eyes . I was only half kidding when I said that about rubbing a magic lamp and getting a free wish . After you told me about your husband , I figured I had better take it slow . But it did n't take long for me to realize that , slow or fast , it was all the same ; I was never going to get anywhere . You 're still in love with him . You ca n't get him out of your mind . He was everything I 'm not . "  | " Yes , " I said . " You are n't . . . any of the things he was . " " Then you do understand why I spoke out of turn ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more days , Kathy . I 'll probably never see you again . Can we go back to what we were , for those few days ? " " We ca n't ever go back . But I understand . " " It 's okay , then ? " " Yes . I think I 'd better go now . " " See you tomorrow ? " His face was anxious . " Yes . Sure . " I headed for the kitchen door , so deep in thought I hardly noticed where I was walking . I was in the kitchen garden , treading blindly on baby lettuces and sprouting carrots when the door burst open and Pete came flying out . His face was as gray as his jacket . He flung himself at me . " Joe . Joe is gone . Did you see him ? " " Why , no . He must be in the house somewhere , Pete . I 'll help you look  --  " He was off , pelting down the path , water spraying up from the puddles struck by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could collect my wits . Then I heard him scream . I reached the stableyard before the echoes of his cry had died . The kitten flew across the cobblestones like a ball of animated fur , hardly touching the ground . The dog was close behind , but Pete was closer , moving on an oblique line and running as I have never seen a child that age run . Without pausing he scooped up a stone . He pitched it underhand , wildly ; instead of hitting the dog , it struck the ground several feet away . But the impact and the sound it made caused the animal to break stride , just long enough . Pete got through the gate into the garden and slammed it shut . I did n't stop running , but I was still twenty feet away when the dog crouched to jump . It is difficult to run and yell at thep198same time . I was trying to do both . Where the hell was David ? Pete 's first cry should have brought him down from his room . The dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second attempt succeeded . The gate was a wooden grille , I could see through it . My stiff fingers fumbled with the catch . Pete had pulled himself up into a tree . Joe was nowhere in sight . I kept wrestlingwith the gate , but my racing heart began to slow . They were safe . The cat must have climbed the same tree . My cries had been heard ; there were voices , footsteps running . The dog was snuffling around the trunk of the tree . He jumped again . He missed the boy 's feet by a good yard , but Pete lost his head and tried to climb higher . His hands slipped on the wet bark and he fell , landing across the limb on which he had been standing , his legs dangling down . I could see the drops dripping from the leaves , the quiver of the muscles in the dog 's haunches as it crouched , the white terror on the boy 's face as he struggled to draw himself up . I could even see Joe , half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high in the tree . All my other senses cut out . I could n't feel my hands or my feet , I could n't hear anything except a high , distant ringing . I could n't hear my own voice ; but I must have called to the dog , because it turned to look at me . The gate opened and I walked into the garden , slowly , not running . The dog stared at me . It knew my voice ; but mine was not the voice it had been trained to obey . The words were not the right words of command . I stooped and picked up a fallen branch . With a sudden pop my hearing came back , the way it does when you swallow hard at a high altitude . I heard myself say , " Good dog . Sit . Stay . That 's a good boy .... Pete , just take it easy . You got up there once , you can do it again .... Sit , good boy . Stay . " The dog 's hindquarters sank down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attack . The mind works oddly at moments like that . I felt as if Ip199had all the time in the world to decide what to do . I doubted that I could make it to the gate . Better to stand and face what was coming . One arm over my throat , one shielding my eyes . Try to get the stick in its mouth . The dog was in mid-leap when the shot cracked like a thunderclap . The shock was so great I staggered , feeling as if the bullet had hit me . The dog twisted and spun , and fell in a tangled heap . I stood as if rooted to the ground , too scared even to faint . My ears rang with the echo of the shot  --  or had there been several shots ? Pete had dropped down out of the tree and was running toward me . When his frantic arms went around me my legs gave way and I sank gently to the ground.  |p201OUT  OF the chaos , faces slowly took shape . Alberto , cradling the rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me but at the twisted body of the dog ; Rosa , wringing her hands and invoking a pantheon of saints ; Emilia ; Francesca , her ashen face contrasting bizarrelywith the lacquered perfection of her hair . Having assured himself I was unharmed , Pete stood up . " I am going to be sick , " he announced . I sat there like a broken doll , my legs doubled up under me . It was David who lifted the boy and held him close . " No , you are n't , " he said . " Take deep breaths . You 're okay , I 'm okay , Kathy is okay . So what 's to worry about ? " From the face pressed against his shirt came a muffled voice . " Joe . "  | " Joe ? " " Joe , " I said , in a voice that did n't sound like mine , " is also o-kay . But I doubt that he 'll want to come down out of that tree in the near future . " " I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , Pete , Joe is n't in any danger now . Suppose I carry you up to bed and then I 'll come back and  --  " " No . Joe will run away . " David looked inquiringly at me . I looked dumbly back at him . My brain had gone as limp as my legs . I just wanted to sit . Francesca touched my shoulder . " Kathleen . The dog did not ... " " Never laid a tooth on me . Thanks to Alberto , " I added grudgingly . He had saved me from serious injury , if not worse , but I found it hard to acknowledge his services . Killing the dog had been the kindest thing he had done to it . " How did the dog slip its chain ? " Francesca demanded . " The whole business is unaccountable . I can not believe  --  " A babble of voices interrupted her . Alberto displayed the end of the chain , with its torn link ; Emilia praised his quick thinking and superb marksmanship ; Rosa raised her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother of God . I leaned toward her interpretation . It was nothing short of a miracle that no one had been hurt . Francesca ended the uproar with a sharp command and gave orders all around . Rosa took Pete to her ample bosom . David shinnied up the tree and retrieved Joe , and we all went to the house for first aid and sympathy . David was the only one who needed first aid . Joe had not wanted to come down . I went upstairs to change clothes . My teeth were chattering , not only with cola , and I accepted Francesca 's offer of a warm robe , since mine was lightweight cotton . Hers was velvet . Real velvet , not polyester , in the pale ivory she fa/vored , trimmed with what appeared to be mink . I trailed my mink hem up the stairs and pounded on Pete 's door . Rosa had put him to bed and was trying to coax him to eat . The tray held enough food for three people , every dish steaming  --  soup , spaghetti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pete said irritably . He was at work on Joe , rubbing him with a towel and trying to get the tangles out of his tail . Joe was not cooperating . " That 's good , " I said . " He can finish the job himself now , Pete . I 'll bet he 'd like some of your milk . " " Yes , he would . " Pete snapped an order at Rosa . He sounded just like his grandmother . She grinned and poured milk into a saucer . Steam rose from it . Rosa blew on the milk so vigorously the surface ruffled into white waves . " Eccolo , " she said , putting the saucer on the floor . Joe sailed into it and Rosa chuckled , her fists on her broad hips . Before I left I had the satisfaction of seeing Pete eat his lunch with a hearty appetite , having apparently suffered no ill effects from his adventure . I did n't mind leaving him with Rosa . He seemed to like her , and his autocratic attitudes only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look after him , instead of Emilia . I exchanged Francesca 's gorgeous robe for my suit  --  the only warm garment I had  --  before I went downstairs . Francescaexclaimed in surprise when I walked in . " I was about to send Emilia to you with a tray . You ought to rest . " I had forgotten my condition . " I 'm fine , " I assured her . " You appear to have taken no harm . " She shook her head . " A shocking experience of that nature would have left me completely prostrate . " " I doubt it , " I said , before I thought , and then added , " That was meant as a compliment , Francesca , even if it did n't sound like one . " " Thank you , Kathleen . "  | " I 'm sorry about the dog . I hope you wo n't think I 'm impertinentif I suggest you ought to entrust its successor to someone other than Alberto . " " You do n't like Alberto . Why ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crude . ... I 'm sorry . But the dog would n't have been so dangerous if he had not mishandled it . A guard dog is a potentially explosive weapon ; in my opinion , animals like that should n't be in any house where there are children . Proper training and handling can minimize the danger , but the dog was n't getting it from Alberto . How did it get loose ? " " Apparently there was a weak link in the chain . Seeing the cat , the animal struggled to free itself  --  " " And how did the cat get out ? " I had no right to quiz her , but remembering Pete 's near escape I got queasy all over again . When I feel queasy I yell . " The child forgot to close the door of his room . " " He did n't . I was with him . I watched him test the latch . " " What are you implying ? " " Someone let the cat out . Oh , it may have been an accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuttofare went in to clean . Or someone may have let it out deliberately , hoping it would run away . " " Is it Emilia you are accusing ? " she asked coolly . " I 'm not accusing anyone . The culprit wo n't confess now , when the consequences were so nearly disastrous . I 'm only pointing out that you ought to make certain it wo n't happen again . " " And I might point out that giving Pietro a pet was not a good idea , since it led him into danger . " " You need n't remind me , " I said wretchedly . " Do n't you suppose I thought of that ? But it 's part of living , Francesca  --  at least , that 's how I look at it . You take chances every time you give someone , or something , a piece of your heart . They ,  |p205or  Fate , may smash it . But what 's the alternative ? Not taking risks , not caring  --  not feeling ? " " I did not intend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been argued by others more eloquent than you . " She fell silent , her face remote . I forced a laugh . " This is turning into a morbid discussion . I did n't mean it to . All 's well that end 's well , after all . " " Trite but true . " " I think I will rest this afternoon , " I said . " It 's starting to rain again ; my room is so pleasant , with the fire and every-thing . " We were getting along swimmingly when the damned telephone rang . When I heard the far-off shrilling , I had a premonition . Sure enough , it was for me . Sebastiano apologized for not calling earlier . " I was late getting in last night , and this morning has been busier than usual . Not a free moment ! You have not forgotten our engagementthis evening ? " " Of course not . Look , Sebastiano , I 've been thinking ; why do n't I meet you ? I could drive to Florence  --  " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kathy . " The tinny impersonality of the connection robbed his voice of emotion ; I could n't tell whether he was joking or offended . " I was only thinking of the time , " I explained . " It 's an hour up here and another hour back  --  " " That is not important . " He was offended . I said quickly , " If you do n't mind , then . To be honest , I hate driving in the rain on unfamiliar roads . " " Do you need spectacles that you are too vain to wear ? " he asked teasingly , his good humor restored . " Never mind , vanity is a sign of mental health . I will pick you up at seven . " I thanked him and hung up . When I turned from the phone , there was Emilia at the door of the sitting room with thep206coffee tray . What she knew , Francesca would soon know . I decided I might as well get it over with . " That was Sebastiano , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to have dinner with him tonight . I hope that does n't conflict with your plans . " " You must do as you like . " " It will be the last time I see him , " I explained . " I want to thank him for his kindness and say good-bye . Besides , there are a few questions I want to ask about Pietro . Supposing I should be able to take him back to the States I ought to know the best way of handling the transition . " " Yes , that is reasonable . " Her stiff face relaxed . Yet as I retreated to my room I felt like a naughty schoolgirl escaping from the principal 's office . The strange thing was , I was beginning to like the woman  --  or rather , not dislike her as much as I had . We had nothing in common , we could never be friends . But if we had met under other circumstances , we might have felt at ease with each other . I had to admit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Sebastiano in the hall . It was raining so hard I preferred Emilia 's not-so-thinly-veiled hostile glances as she passed back and forth between the kitchen and the sitting room . I wondered why she disliked me so much  --  or rather , why she let it show . Alberto could n't have any better opinion of me , but he had never been less than obsequious after the first encounter , when he had not known who I was . As soon as I saw the headlights I pulled the hood of the raincoat over my head and went out . Dusk had fallen ; Sebastianodid n't see me till I opened the car door and tumbled in . " Is this the American liberation I am always reading about ? "  |p207he  demanded . " You ca n't allow a man to do something for you ? " " It is n't liberation , it 's common sense . Why should both of us get wet ? " " I have , " said Sebastiano , " an umbrella . " I remained respectfully silent , and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say that ? I sound like an English butler . " " I 'll let you use the umbrella next time , " I promised . He did n't get a chance at the restaurant ; the doorman had his own , a perfect monster of an umbrella , the biggest I had seen off a beach . We did not go into the city , but dined at a new restaurant on the outskirts ; it had been a monastery , and the restoration was charming and whimsical . Favored patrons , of whom Sebastiano appeared to be one , had tables in miniature white-painted cells , with a discrete wooden grille on the open side . Since I never can leave well enough alone , I proceeded to spoil the cheerful atmosphere by asking Sebastiano if his ribs had healed . After all , the last time I had seen him , he had been hobbling with one hand pressed to his side as if he expected the contents to spill out . The question brought a frown to his face , and a curt reply : He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoyance for a display of wounded male ego and would have dropped the subject ; but then he said , still frowning , " I suppose I must tell you . I have been debating as to whether I ought ; but if you are driving yourself , especiallyat night . .. The reason I skidded is because someone ran out in front of the car . " " Good heavens ! Alberto , was it ? " " Not Alberto . This was someone I had never seen before  --  a truly monstrous figure , like a creature from one of the old horror films . He appeared out of nowhere . I had to slam the brakes on and the car went out of control . "  | " I think I know who it was , " I said . " Francesca has a poor mentally handicapped man working as assistant to Alberto . He has physical handicaps as well . " " Ah , I see . It occurred to me that it was a vagrant  --  a tramp . But in that first moment I confess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded of the great Lon Chaney in some of his masterful performances . " " I know how you felt . I had a brief encounter with the man one day in broad daylight , and I was uneasy too . I do n't suppose he realized that he was endangering himself , or you . " " I 'm glad you understand . Most of the unfortunates who suffer from such handicaps are the gentlest of people . You probably frightened him more than he frightened you in the encounter you spoke of . It is a shame the public has such a distorted view of mental illness . " " Thanks in part to those horror movies you 're so fond of . " " People ought to be able to distinguish between fact and fantasy . " He added shrewdly , " Do n't you liberated ladies have daydreams of being overpowered by a handsome pirate or highwayman ? You would n't really want it to happen to you , though . " I did n't resent the touch of malice in his speech . He could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned my attention to the menu . It was decorated with amusing little sketches of plump monks doing various things .... " Good heavens , " I said , blinking . Sebastiano laughed . " They are clever sketches , are n't they ? I hope they do n't offend you . Outsiders are sometimes puzzledby what they consider our cavalier approach to religion . " I assured him I was not offended . The approach of adolescentgirls to religion is not always conventional , either . I told him about a sign one of the girls had tacked up on her locker , until one of the nuns removed it . " Holy Virgin , who conceived without sin , let me sin without conceiving . " Sebastiano chortled over that one , and we exchanged sto/ries until we were toying with salad , which in Italy , as I had discovered , is served after the main course . I was having such a good time I almost hated to bring up the subject of Pete . I knew I was going to be scolded . He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack , but the look he gave me was not exactly admiring . " And you did n't mention it to Francesca ? Kathy , I ca n't believe you could be so careless . " I did n't deny the charge . " I 'd have called you if you had been available . Oh hell , why not admit it ? I do n't approve of the way Francesca is handling the child . " " I assume she is following my instructions . You are a sentimentallittle thing , Kathleen . " I did n't deny that accusation either , though it sparked a tiny flame of resentment . I do n't like being treated like a sweet little dumb female . " Is it your idea that he live at home , without a tutor or governess or teacher ? Without friends his own age ? There is n't one person in that house who shows him affection , except the cook , and he hardly ever sees her . " " I suggested to Francesca that he would be better off at school . There are excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? Why have n't you insisted ? " " Insist ? With Francesca ? " His laugh was tinged with bitterness . " I sometimes think a hereditary nobility is the curse of any country . They have no power ; they are often stupid , uneducated ; yet the aura of superiority still surrounds them . " " Francesca would be charismatic if she had been born in a gutter , " I said . " I understand your dilemma ; she 's in charge of the boy , and you ca n't force her to do anything she does n't want to do . You 'll be glad to hear that she is considering a change . Within the next few days . " " What ? She has said nothing to me . But , " he added sourly , " she would not consider it necessary . She would n't notify her hairdresser or her plumber that she meant to stop his services . "  | " Come on now , " I said . " You 're a big , grown-up psychiatrist . Ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be a psychiatrist , but I am also human . " He shook his head . " This news disturbs me . Vanity aside , I would have expected her to consult me as to where the boy should be sent . The doctor who takes over his treatment ought to know what I have done and what results I have achieved . How soon is this change to take place ? " " Maybe I should n't have said anything . " " I wo n't mention that you told me . But I am entitled to know what you know . " He was all business , brisk and professional . I had to agree with him . So I told him what Francesca had said . " She is closing the villa ? " he exclaimed . " But then you  --  you too are going away . " " You must have known I would , sooner or later . This is n't my home . " " Of course . I do n't know why I had the impression you were staying on indefinitely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see you again . " He took my hand and looked deep into my eyes . His disappointmentpleased me , but it also aroused feelings I could not encourage . " Now who 's being sentimental ? " I said lightly . " I 'll be back one day . At least I hope I will . This has n't exactly been a pleasure trip . " We lingered late over coffee and brandy , talking  --  mostly about Pete , but also about the country Sebastiano loved and his regret that I had seen so little of it . " Surely I will see you another time before you go , " he said . " I had better not plan on it . My schedule is still uncertain . And Francesca does n't like my seeing you . I wo n't sneakbehind her back , and I do n't want to make her angry . " " You are not immune to the aristocratic aura , either . " " It is n't that . " I did n't want to tell him my real reasons forp211wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually said she was sending Pete back to the States with me ; if I told Sebastiano , he might repeat my statement to Francesca , despite his promises , and she might resent my interference . Sebastiano did n't give up easily . He continued to press his point as we drove back . " There is so much to see and do in Italy , so much to experience . It is nothing less than an insult that you are leaving so soon . You need not stay with Francesca . There are other places . " 1 Other bedrooms , other beds . He would n't make the offer openly unless I responded to his hint . There was enough of the traditionalist under his modern manners to make him a little hesitant about propositioning a widow of three months  --  a sharer , however faintly , of that aristocratic aura he had mentioned . If it had n't been for Pete ... well , I 'm not sure how I would have responded . As it was , all I could do was pretend I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear pretty simpleminded . He was still at it when we stopped in front of the villa . " Do n't go in just yet , " he murmured . " It is still early  --  see , there are lights in several windows . " Making out in the front seat of a car is n't my idea of comfort . If Sebastiano had yearned to bid me a prolonged and passionate farewell , there had been a dozen places along the way where he could have pulled off the road . I knew his reason for waiting until we reached the villa , and a damned childish reason it was . He had even checked to make sure the inhabitants were awake and watching before .. . One of the lighted windows was that of my room . The golden rectangle was bisected by a shadow . It was blurred by rain and distance , but I knew what it was doing . Looking down at the car . Emilia , on her nightly errand of turning down the bed andp212tidying the room ? The shadowy shape looked taller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , " I said . He took my hand . " I find it harder to say good-bye than I had thought . There is a conference this fall , in New York .... " I agreed to meet him in New York , to call him before I left Italy , to try to find time to see him again . I may have agreed to move in with him or help him rob a bank ; I do n't know what I said . I did n't linger to make sure he negotiated the drive without incident . The door was unlocked . I closed it and went straight up the stairs . My room was empty . The fire had been built up and the bedclothes had been turned back . Across the bed . . . It looked like the sprawled body of a woman , impossibly slender , long skirts trailing , head concealed by the shadow of the curtains . I found the switch controlling the chandelier and the room sprang into brilliant light . It was n't a body . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chambermaids in old-fashioned , elegant hotels  --  waist pinched , skirts carefully spread out . Not that I had ever stayed in such places , but I had read or heard about the custom . The most interesting thing was that it was not my nightgown . It looked like one of Francesca 's ; silk chiffon , transparent as a drift of cloud , lace-trimmed and embroidered . I touched the folds of the skirt . The garment looked brandnew , but the truth did n't dawn on me until I saw the other things . They lay in piles on the chair next to the bed , neatly folded , just as they had come from the shop . Bras and panties , nightgowns , slips  --  the finest batiste and the most delicate silk , tucked and pleated . When I acted , it was without conscious thought . The emotionthat moved me was n't anger or resentment or pride , it was simple negation  --  a large , silent NO . Carrying the nightgown , I marched down the hall to Francesca'sroom . She was n't asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear them through the heavy door suggested that she was berating Emilia about something . I knocked . Francesca answered : " Who is it ? " She must have known who it was , otherwise she would n't have spoken English . I answered anyway . " It 's me , Kathy . I 'd like to talk to you . " " Just a moment . " It was more than a moment . The seconds ticked by as I stood there . When Francesca finally opened the door I thought I understood the delay . She would n't allow anyone except her maid  --  a nonperson , by her definition  --  to see her au naturel . Her makeup had been so hastily applied it failed to cover the deep lines framing her mouth . She stood back to let me enter . It was the first time I had seen her bedroom . The color scheme was her favorite ivory and off-white ; it gave the room an oddly Spartan , almost monkish appearance . But the sheets on the narrow bed were silk , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aids . The only other modern touch was a small clock radio . There was no one else in the room , so I decided I must have heard the radio . Or else Emilia had gone out through the adjoining room , presumably a bathroom , whose door stood slightly ajar . I held out the nightgown . " I ca n't take this , Francesca . Or the other things . I appreciate the thought , but I ca n't . " Her only visible reaction was a tightening of the muscles at the corners of her mouth . Anger , I assumed . I had not been very gracious . After a moment she said , " Do n't you like the . . . things ? " " They 're beautiful . But  --  no , they are n't what I would have selected , even if I had the money . I have n't time to handwashand iron lingerie . " " Money , " she repeated , with a faint distaste . " As I told you , you have a legitimate claim . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sayp214that if there was something owed me , I 'd rather have the cash . The amount that had been spent on the lacy frivolities would have paid my rent for a year . So the discussion ended , as it had before , with my giving in  --  or appearing to . I could n't afford to alienate her at this stage . I told myself I would leave the clothes in the wardrobe when I left . As I went out I noticed that the door next to Francesca 's was open . So was the door leading into the abandoned wing . Emilia could have gone that way . I had meant to ask her if she had been in my room , but the question was irrelevant now . It must have been Francesca whom I had seen looking down from the window . A breath of cold air brushed my face from the open door . The darkness at the end of the long , empty corridor seemed to shift and curdle , like shadows trying to shape themselves into a solid form . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughter , trembling on the rim of soundlessness . When I got back to my room , breathless and shaking , I saw that the fragile silk of the gown was crushed and wrinkledwhere my hands had squeezed it . I threw it onto the chair and got into bed . Then I got out of bed . Once again the hated , the toofamiliarritual  --  a look at a sleeping child , a turn of a key in the lock . The hallway was chilly with dampness , and some of the bulbs had burned out . I WAS beginning to count the days  --  and the nights . Perhaps the weather had something to do with my growing impatience to be gone . Wednesday was another gloomy , dripping day , which meant I could n't take Pete outdoors . I should have driven to Florence and visited the museums , and thep215other sights that draw tourists from all over the world ; heaven knew when I would be able to afford to visit Europe again . Hopefully I would come back someday ; but at the moment I only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legitimate need to know how Francesca 's plans were developing . I had promised my father I 'd call when I got my reservation . That call had yet to be made . I faced Francesca with the question at breakfast ; and , as usual , her unsmiling regard drove me into incoherent and graceless explanations that probably bored her as much as they disgustedme . " I have to let the folks know when I 'm arriving . It 's a long drive from Wayford to Boston , and my brothers work , and so does my father , part-time anyhow , and my mother hates to drive .... " " I understand . You have not telephoned your father ? " " Not yet . But I told him I would , and he 'll be wondering . " " Would it be inconvenient for you to wait until Saturday ? You see , " she went on smoothly , " I am working on the arrangementswe discussed earlier . I have been assured I will be notified by Friday . It may be late in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Saturday morning you will be able to tell your parents of your plans . " She sounded even more formal and stilted than usual , and the vagueness of her reply irritated me . She must have realizedthis , for she added , in a more conciliatory tone , " I have every reason to suppose that you will be able to leave Florence as you planned , on Sunday , and that the other arrangement will work out as you desire . " " Oh . Oh , that 's wonderful ! I 'm so pleased . " " You are , are n't you ? " She studied me wonderingly . " I too am pleased , of course . To be quite honest , it will be a relief to have someone else take charge of the boy . I know I am not the best of guardians . I really do n't care for children . " " Not even Bart ? " " He was different . " She did n't say how . Perhaps she didn'tp216know herself . Parents try to love all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one child that brings out a stronger response from one parent or the other , or both . I did n't hang around after breakfast . Francesca appeared to be preoccupied . She had asked , with only the faintest tinge of irony , if I wanted to accompany her and Pete to the doctor 's that morning . It would be his last appointment , so they might be late returning ; she had a number of things to discuss with Dr. Manetti . I declined , with thanks , and removed myself . It looked like a long , boring day . The news had cheered me considerably , but had made me even more anxious to shake the dust of the Villa Morandini off my shoes . I had been mistaken when I hoped the trip would help rid me of Bart . The ghosts of the boy he had been and the man he had become haunted every corridor and moved in the shadows of the gardens . I knew that was foolish , of course . The ghosts that haunt us are in our own minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and space . But I would find it easier to exorcise that laughing shadow in some other place than this . For want of anything better to do , I went looking for David . He was n't in his room . The grubby scraps of Coptic embroiderycovered every flat surface . He had placed lamps over some  --  ordinary table lamps , with ordinary bulbs . Most of the scraps still felt soggy . The only other place he could be was the attic , so I went there , using the back stairs . As I approached I heard him muttering to himself in his favorite blend of personal commentaryand poetic quotation . I looked in . " How 's it going ? " David was holding a handful of papers . He flung them into the air and said , " ' Shut , shut the door , good girl ( fatigued I said ) , Tie up the knocker , say I 'm sick , I 'm dead . " " That is n't Browning ! " " Pope . How are you getting on with Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . " I ca n't tie up the knocker , there is n't one , and besides , I do n't know how . Are things that bad ? " " Things are worse , " David said , stooping to retrieve the scattered papers . " This has really left me in a bind , dammit . I 'd counted on six weeks or more . " " I 'm sorry . " " Any chance that she 'll change her mind ? " " I do n't think so . She told me this morning that Sunday would probably be the day . I do n't know when she  --  " " What about the kid ? " He spoke casually , but I could see he was really concerned . " He 's going with me . It 's not absolutely dead certain , so do n't say anything to him , but it 's looking good . " " That 's what you wanted ? " " Well , of course . This is a miserable life for a child . Do n't you agree ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily at me , his long , thin mouth drawn down at the corners , his eyes narrowed . I prayed he was n't going to bring up the subject we had agreed to forget . I had n't forgotten  --  I never could  --  but his manner had been so normal since that one slip that I had been able to behave as usual . " What 's the matter ? " I asked . " Is my face turning green or something ? " " Sorry . I am struggling with the impossibility of my own conclusions . Did you come to offer a helping hand ? " " I 'll be glad to help if I can . " He put me to work . Real work . Whenever I stopped to exclaim over a nineteenth-century ball gown , packed in camphor , or an album of family photographs in a fat velvet cover , he yanked this treasure out of my hands and gave me another pile of papers to sort . If effort is any proof of honesty , he really was looking for manuscripts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francesca had given him his march/ing orders , he was n't bothering about the family " collec-tions . " I tore myself away , without too much effort , when it was time for lunch . My promptness was wasted , however . Francescawas not there . Emilia gave me another of those exquisite notes , in which Francesca said she would also be out for dinner . " Is Pietro with her , or did he come back ? " I asked Emilia . " He is here , signora . In his room . " " As usual , " I muttered . " Signora ? " " Nothing . That 's all , Emilia . You need n't wait ; I prefer to serve myself . " Still she lingered . " Is there any food for which you have a desire , signora ? Any special dish ? " She might have been consulting me about the dinner menu . But she was n't . Her eyes were fixed on my napkin-draped lap , and her smile was sly . I told her no , and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our departure was imminent , I found myself curious about Pete 's academic capabilities . Once a teacher , always a teacher . I had done my practice teaching with fourth graders , so I had a rough  --  very rough  --  idea of what to look for . Pete grumbled when I asked him to answer a few questions , but complied ; we ran through some math problems and discussed dinosaurs and Pilgrims and George Washington , and read from the cat book . He was deficient in math , but up to grade level on most other subjects . He admitted he had liked history . His mother had read to him every night ; he was familiar with most of the children 's classics . And he knew one hell of a lot about football.  |p219The  rain continued to dribble depressingly , so I had to refuse his invitation to practice kicking . I had a whole bagful of tricks for rainy days , culled from pedagogical journals , but in fact none of them worked well for children over the age of five . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sleep , " I said after Joe had refused an invitation to chase the string . " I have an idea . Why do n't we explore ? Maybe we can find someplace where we can play ball or hide-and-seek or something . " He agreed , rather listlessly . There were endless rooms , some locked , some open ; some furnished , some filled with discarded odds and ends . The unfurnished rooms were too small for strenuous games , the furnished rooms had too many breakables . I was looking for something like a ballroom or a grand gallery . Surely houses of this stature had to have a ballroom ? I could n't find it , and Pete said he did n't know . He was bored and had no hesitation in showing it . " Maybe it 's in this part of the house , " I said . We were in the corridor where Francesca 's room was located ; I indicated the door , now closed , that led to the empty wing . Pete shrank back . " No . We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It 's broad daylight ; we can see if there are holes in the floor , or  --  " " I do n't like it there , " Pete whispered . " Please , signora  --  do n't make me go . " I took his hand . " You 're freezing cold , " I said , and then , quickly , " So am I. Let 's run , okay ? I bet I can beat you to the stairs . " So , in the end , we went looking for David . He was at work , mumbling and swearing , but we extracted him for a quick run around the grounds . By that time I had decided I preferredrain to boredom  --  not to mention whatever it was in the empty wing that had so frightened the child . The run took quite a bit of time  --  not the running itself , but the assumption of outdoor garb and the removal of same ,  |p220the  drying of hair and the changing of clothes . Joe was awake and cooperative when we got back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then it was almost time for supper . David left , with self-righteous remarks about people who had to work while others frittered away their time . I had finally come up with an idea ; Pete was sprawled on the hearth rug drawing a picture of Joe . There was no fire , and we could have used one that bleak evening , but even without it the room was cozier than Francesca 's immaculate sitting room , and I did n't feel like dining alone with Emilia eyeing my flat stomach and freezing me with her silent criticism of my table manners . " How about my having supper with you ? " I asked . " Will you ? " He beamed with pleasure . " I 'll go ask Rosa . Be back in a minute . " Rosa and I communicated very well . She had three words of English and I had ten words of Italian , but both of us were great at gestures . She thought it would be fine if I ate with Pete . " Tell Emilia ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it looked like a rude remark from the gesture that accompanied it . I left it at that . The cook was the one who was chiefly inconvenienced by changes in meals . When Rosa brought the food she was accompanied by the tuttofare , both carrying trays . The covered dishes filled the entire surface of the table . There was milk for Pete and a bottle of wine for me . " Let 's have a toast , " I said when we were alone . " Good . I will have wine , " Pete announced , reaching for the bottle . " No , you will not . You 've got to learn to eat American style if you . . . " I stopped just in time . I did n't want to tell him what was in store ; according to Francesca , matters were virtuallysettled , but if the deal fell through , the disappointment would be crushing . " When you 're as old as I am you canp221poison yourself as much as you like , " I went on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " It is not fair , " Pete said . His lower lip went out . " Life is not fair , " I agreed . " Grin and bear it . " " I hate milk . Especially the Italian milk . It is too hot , never cold like American milk . Sometimes when they do n't see me , I throw it away . " " Joe does n't agree with you , " I said as the kitten leaped onto the table , his whiskers twitching . " Grab him , Pete , he 's heading for the chicken . " Pete thought it was funny . He sat there chuckling , and I reached for Joe . Joe eluded me and bore down on Pete 's glass of milk . He did n't get more than a slurp or two before I collared him . " Well , that gets you off the hook with the milk , " I said , trying to sound stern . " Lord knows I 'm not fussy , but that cat probably still has several varieties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away ? " " Yes , you had better . But do n't get any ideas about using Joe as an excuse , at least not while I 'm around . I 'm on to that one now . " Pete came back from the bathroom with a glass of water , so I gathered my lecture on American eating habits had had the proper effect . It was a pretty fiction , but I saw no reason to admit that alcoholism among American teenagers was risinglike a rocket . Who should know better than a teacher ? The only way we could keep Joe off the table was by sneakinghim tidbits . He particularly relished the chicken , which he gobbled up like a glutton . It may have saved his life . We were barely finished with dinner when he let out a low moaning mew and began gagging . Saliva drooled from his open mouth . " Leave him alone , " I said to Pete , who was trying to get out of his chair . " He ate too fast . He 's just ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That wasp222just the beginning . The cat 's back arched in a spasm . He collapsed onto his side , kicking . Pete got to him before I could intervene , and pulled back a hand streaming with blood . Joe jumped high in the air and began racing around the room , ricocheting off the walls , falling and picking himself up again , crashing into the furniture . I grabbed a blanket from the bed and pounced . The warm bundle under my hands writhed and howled ; it felt like a tiger , not a small kitten . I fended Pete off with my elbow . Tears were streaming down his face . " He 'll be all right , Pete . It 's okay . Leave it to me . " I hoped I was n't lying . Fits can be caused by a number of things , from worms to epilepsy . If I had given the child a pet suffering from some fatal disease ... The contorted lump finallywent limp and I cautiously extracted it from the blanket , wrapping it in a fold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't dead . Not yet , anyway . His half-closed eyes were an uncanny white , the extra eyelid that shows when an animal is sick or comatose . The minuscule pulse was beatingwildly and erratically . All I could do was hold him and try to reassure his hysterical owner . By the time we got him to a vet the attack would be over  --  one way or the other . I had almost decided we had better make the attempt , at least , when the heartbeat started to steady . Joe opened one eye . He must not have liked what he saw , because he closed it again ; but a faint purr began to vibrate through his body . A short time later , still glassy-eyed but seemingly recovered , he was curled up in Pete 's arms ready to take a nap . " What was it ? What hurt him ? " Pete 's face was still sticky with tears . " Nothing serious . It happens sometimes . " What the hell could it have been ? I ran over the symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spasms  --  like the ones Pete had had that awful night .. .  |p223And  then I knew . I wondered how I could have been so blind . The kitten was the final clue , but I ought to have known before . I had seen it before  --  in my own classroom , right in the middle of a quiz on the Louisiana Purchase . I remembered how I had paced the floor that night , raging , telling Bart about it , cursing the people who sold the stuff to children . The balance of that evening reminded me , in retrospect , of a home movie some of my kids had produced for extra credit . One of the characters was the ghost of Abigail Adams . It 's an easy special-effects technique and the kids loved doing it . Abigail lay recumbent on her deathbed , while a shadowy similacrum rose from her body and strolled hither and yon , then returned to blend into the original form again . That 's how it was with me . I sat on the floor holding Joe , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chatted with Pete , watched the cat play with the remainder of the food , thanked Rosa when she came to take the trays , tucked Pete into bed ... . It was the shadow me who kissed Pete good night and closed and locked his door ; the shadow who undressed and put on robe and slippers ; who stood by the door until she heard Francesca pass down the corridor and enter her room ; who continued to wait , counting off the minutes , until the house was quiet ; who tiptoed up the stairs and into Pete 's room ; who locked the door  --  on the inside . Not until I lowered myself into a chair did the two parts of me click back together . One of us must have been thinking , because I could see the whole thing now , in all its deadly completeness . Lysergic acid diethylamide . It could have been one of the other hallucinogenic drugs , mescaline , DMT , morning-glory seeds  --  but it was probaby LSD , a small fleck of which can produce all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a speck in that glass of milk . The cat had only absorbed a minute quantity , but its body weight was so small it had been violently if briefly affected . Why had n't I recognized it in the child ? That was easy . For the same reasons Sebastiano had never thought of drug abuse as the explanation for Pete 's illness . By the time he saw the boy , the physical symptoms had passed . He might jeer at Francesca 's melodramatic diagnosis of hereditary madness , but he had only substituted the conventional theories of his own specialty  --  " infantile death wishes , " " transitory manic-depressive state characteristic of mourning , " " breaking through of the unconscious at night . " Pete 's history fit that diagnosis . It did n't fit the pattern of drug abuse . The child had no access to drugs . He was isolated from his peers , from the outside world . Besides , the symptoms of LSD vary widely , depending on a number of factors  --  dosage , individual tolerance , psychologicalstrengths and weaknesses . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by habitual users , is an intensificationof sensory impressions . Colors blaze out , textures are magnified , sounds take on a richer meaning . Often there is a phenomenon called synesthesia , the confusion of one sense with another . Users see music , feel color , hear light . During the course of a single episode , extreme mood swings can occur , from ecstasy to terror . Also suspicion and hostility .. . I had done my homework on drugs ; a teacher who does n't is neglecting part of her job these days . You have to know the facts . The kids can tell when you fake it , and the truth is never quite as bad as the things you imagine . To call LSD a hallucinogen is n't strictly accurate , because the users rarely have genuine hallucinations . They see and feel the real world . They just do n't see it in the usual way . They can even control the effects to some extent , if they are fully aware of what is happening . The so-called bad trips are much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotionally disturbedp225to begin with , or if he does n't know what to expect . Pete had n't known . He was not even aware he had taken a drug . I thought of him waking in the middle of the night with his heart pounding and shudders shaking his body , to see his familiar room transformed into a crazy house  --  the red chair humming in a low baritone , the rain shooting rays of bright light through the barred window , his pajamas rubbing his skin like sandpaper . I had read of one case in which the user looked in a mirror and saw his face sag and run , like melting wax . What had Pete seen in his mirror before he smashed it ? What ghastly transformation had altered my face when he covered his eyes and refused to look at me ? I had to clench my jaws to keep my teeth from chattering . My thin cotton robe was n't much protection against the April chill , but it was not cold that made me shiver . My first impulse , an impulse I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and run . Some remnant of common sense had warned me that might be disastrous . There were too many unknowns , and I was too vulnerable  --  in a foreign country , with no legal right to act for the boy , opposing an adversary who had all the clout and influence I lacked . Many of the options I would have sought if I had been at home were closed to me here . For once in my life I had to stop and think before I acted . Think . Think . Try to figure out their next move . How many more days ? She had talked about the weekend . Would n't she prefer to wait until after I had gone  --  until David was no longer on the premises ? Why commit such a vile act with witnesses present , when she could easily rid herself of them ? I wanted to believe that . It would have given me more time . But every scrap of evidence confirmed the probability that Friday was the day . The ambiguous hints that had perplexedme took on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final decision as to Pete 's future would be made on Friday  --  " late Friday , perhaps . " She had suggested I waitp226until Saturday before calling home . By that time I would be in a position to tell my parents of my plans . Naturally I would want to stay over for the funeral ... . If she had entered the room at that moment I would have gone for her throat . I no longer doubted her intention , even though I did not understand her motive or her reasons for not waiting until I was out of the picture . It would be Friday night . And since she was so certain of the result , the next attempt would n't be like the others . It would be brutal and direct . Do n't imagine it was easy for me to believe that Francesca was planning the murder of her own grandson . I kept turning the bits and pieces of evidence over in my mind , trying to find another explanation . One possibility , that Pete was taking the stuff himself , just did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could obtain illegal drugs was Alberto ; and in addition to the inherent unlikeliness of such an affiance , I felt sure Alberto would n't dare do such a thing without Francesca'sapproval . Nor was it likely that the boy could have brought a supply of drugs with him . She had made him discard his clothes , his books , his toys ; where could he hide the stuff ? I would love to have cast Alberto in the role of chief villain , but that would n't wash either . If he wanted to rid himself of an obstacle , he 'd use a club or a gun . He and Emilia must be involved . It would have taken both of them to carry out the scheme with the kitten , and it was probably Emilia who drugged the boy 's food . But neither was capable of inventing a scheme so diabolically subtle . They were only the tools ; the brain directing them belonged to someone else . Francesca was n't the only candidate , though . There was another possibility . David . I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francesca had been satisfied with his credentials , but shep227was n't omniscient . Surely it was a strange coincidence that he should turn up now , on a job that was , to say the least , rather unusual . David had taken pains to ingratiate himself with the cook . He could n't always arrange to be hanging around the kitchen when the boy 's food was prepared , but the drug had not been used every night . There had not been time for David to fetch the kitten from Pete 's room , but if Joe had escaped by himself and David had spotted him outside , he might have been able to slip in and free the dog . The most damning evidence against David was the drug connection . The night I saw him in the garden and mistook him for Bart he had been smoking pot . The smell was unmistakable . I did n't believe it was David . I did n't want it to be David . I had not even thought of him initially . It was n't until I sat huddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I acted , that the thought occurred to me . Which proved I had been wise not to take Pete and make a run for it . I probably would have run to David. a I had read a lot of books with plots like this . I had often wondered how any heroine could be dumb enough to mistake the villain for the hero . I had often thought contemptuously , Why does n't the stupid wench go to the police ? Now I knew why . I could see myself trying to convince a local cop that a member of one of the most distinguished families in Tuscany was planning to kill her grandson . " And who are you who make this accusation , signorina ? " Oh , just a passerby , a stranger , a foreigner  --  a woman who is fresh out of a mentalinstitution . I 'd be lucky if they did n't lock me up . The night should have dragged on interminably , but it was all too short . The window was a sickly square of cloudshadoweddawn before I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By myself , confiding in no one , because there was no one I was certain I could trust . I was not completely without resources . There were people who would testify to my char/acter . I had no criminal record ; I had been sick , but raging paranoia was n't one of my problems . The boy 's aunt and uncle might help . My father . . . He 'd hop the first plane if he thought I was in trouble . Given time , I could marshal those allies and put up a fight , especially if I held the trump card  --  Pete . The only question remaining was where to hide him . I could n't get him out of the country without a passport . I think I would have risked a charge of kidnapping with hardly a qualm if I had had that essential document ; but after I had considered the pros and cons I realized it would n't work . The flight took too long . By the time the plane landed , they would know Pete and I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of assorted law-enforcementagents . Besides , Francesca probably had his passport , and my chances of finding it were slim to nil , with Emilia watching every move I made . There was only one place I could take him . It had the advantage of being so illogical only an idiot would have thought of it.  |p229STILL  have nightmares occasionally  --  not about Bart , butabout that last , awful day . I 'm carrying the child and tryingIto run through some dark viscous substance that sucks at my feet . Far ahead I can see the gray light of morning , but there is darkness all around me and behind , where the dog is close on our trail . The jingling of its broken chain gets louder and louder . Dim forms lunge at us from the side of the path as we struggle forward  --  Alberto , aiming his rifle , Francesca , reaching out with arms that stretch like rubber and end in taloned hands . I pass them in a desperate burst of speed . I 'm gaining on the dog ; the sounds behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he is there , blocking the way , laughing , lank greasy hair covering his face . Almost all his face . That was the mood of that final day  --  frustrated desper/ation , desperate frustration ; I wanted to act , and I could not . The only thing in my favor was that the weather continued to be cloudy . For once in my life I was praying for rain . We 'd have a better chance of getting away if we waited until nighttime  --  darknessveiling our movements , hours elapsing beforeour absence was discovered . It was the best plan , but it was susceptible to change , depending on the circumstances . I dared not assume Pete was safe until Friday night . I had to be ready to make a break for it if he was threatened , or if an unexpected opportunity presented itself . I dreaded seeing Francesca that morning . I was afraid I would n't be able to hide my knowledge , that she 'd see my feelings written on my face . It was n't easy , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . She was distracted too , and that helped . When we sat down to breakfastshe had a list in her hand , and the first thing she said was , " You have n't forgotten that you have a fitting today ? " I had forgotten . I was trying to think how to get out of it  --  for I had no intention of leaving Pete unwatched for that length of time  --  when Francesca went on , " Unfortunately I will not be able to accompany you . You do n't mind going alone , do you ? " " Maybe I 'll take Pietro with me , " I said . " We could pick up a few things for the trip  --  games , comic books . " " If you like . " The only emotion she displayed was the usual poorly concealed incredulity that I could possibly enjoy the boy 's company . So far so good , I thought . I went on , " We 'll have lunch in Florence . " She nodded , studying her list . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no need for Alberto to drive us . I 'll take my car . " I might have known it would n't be that easy . Francesca looked up , frowning . " That would be foolish , " she said sharply . " It is raining and you do n't know your way . I won'tp231be needing Alberto this afternoon . I have a great deal to do here . " I was afraid to press the point . I felt as if I were balancing on a tightrope ; the wrong word , the wrong look could betray me . She continued to inspect me with a new keenness . " You do n't seem your usual self , Kathleen . Did you sleep well last night ? " I was prepared for that one . " I did n't , as a matter of fact . I was worried about Pietro . It seemed to me he was a little high-strung last night . When I went up to look in on him he was awfully restless . I guess it was just overfatigue , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I fell asleep in the chair and did n't wake till daybreak . " Stop there , I told myself . Do n't explain too much . I had to have some sort of explanation , in case they had discovered I had spent the night in Pete 's room . It would have been wiser to avoid that change in routine  --  the only thing I had going for me was the fact that they believed I was unwitting  --  but I had simply been unable to face the alternative . Francesca appeared to buy my excuse . " I admire your conscientiousness . But you must n't wear yourself out . Your health is important . " I assured her I felt fine , top-notch , in the pink ; but I knew I had better get out of that room . There were limits as to how long I could play the game . So much for the hope of getting him away before nightfall . If I could keep from cracking under the strain , the trip to Florence would give me a chance to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete graciously accepted my invitation . " Will we go to a movie ? " he asked hopefully . " I have not gone to a movie since I came here . I like movies about murderers and rob-bers . " " We 'll see . "  |p232Pete  had a good time , at any rate . I must have put on an adequate performance ; he did n't seem to notice anything odd in my behavior . He was bored at the couturier 's , but I cut that as short as I could by telling the astonished fitter that everything was fine the way it was . I do n't suppose she had ever had such an easy time of it with any customer , especially with Francesca or her kin . I did derive some satisfaction out of running Alberto ragged . I made him drive all over town looking for the things I wanted , and I dismissed him as cavalierly as Francesca would have done while Pete and I ate lunch and sat through a long movie about bank robbers . I would never have permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  when the " hero " was n't shooting guards or massacring witnesses , he was making love to his girlfriend  --  but I decided this was no time to cavil at minor moral issues . The important thing was to stay out of the house as long as possible . In the course of the day I managed to complete all my errands  --  stocking up on games and reading material for Pete , buying a carrier for Joe , and cashing my traveler 's checks . I had a little over seven hundred dollars , and I figured I might need it . I also bought Pete a coat and a cap and had the store wrap them . It was n't much of a disguise , but it was better than nothing . My last move was to take Pete to a trattoria and stuff him with every filling item on the menu . It was getting late by then and Alberto was obviously resentful of the delay , but I did n't think he was suspicious . He was not smart enough to figure out why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pete was big-eyed with delight at the idea of choosing anything he wanted , and I watched benevolently as he finishedoff his meal with ice cream and an assortment of pastries . Twilight was closing in when we returned to the villa , and my spirits began to revive . The interminable day was almost over . I would only have to face Francesca one more time , killp233a few more hours , and then we would be on our way . The nasty encounters that were sure to follow did n't worry me . There was only one thing that did worry me , and once Pete was safe , I could handle abuse , accusations , and anything else . Pete went rushing up to show Joe his carrier . I doubted that Joe would share his enthusiasm , and cautioned him about introducing it gradually and tactfully . If Joe started howling when we carried him out , we were in trouble . I took the parcel containing the coat and cap with me and locked it in my suitcase . My next stop was the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper and cautioned her not to give him anything more to eat or drink . I was ninety-nine percent sure of Rosa , but she could n't help me ; she was too much in awe of Francesca . After I had returned to my room I sat down and went over my plans again . Was there anything I had neglected , anything else I could do , any emergency I had n't anticipated ? The answer to the last question was a resounding , depressing yes . The definition of an emergency is something you have not anticipated . But I 'd done everything I could and I was now at the point where my thoughts ran around in circles like a hamster on a wheel . I walked into the salone without knocking . Francesca was at her desk . My unannounced appearance startled her so that her pen made an ugly jagged line across the page on which she was writing . " I 'm so sorry , " I said . Slowly and deliberately Francesca crumpled the paper and dropped it into a wastebasket . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervousness lessened mine . For in spite of all my logic a doubt lingered in my mind . Was I committing the same error of which I had been accused so often and so justly  --  misinterpreting facts , building fantastic theories onp234inadequate foundations ? I knew myself well enough to know it was possible . The very monstrousness of the plot made it hard to believe . It was not the first time I had faced that possibility , but the answer was simple and incontrovertible . Right or wrong , sane or demented , I had to carry out my plan . I could not take the chance of being . . . right . So I met Francesca 's frown with a bland smile , and when she asked if I had completed my errands , I said glibly , " Yes , we had a great time . I cashed a few traveler 's checks and bought a carrier for the kitten . I almost forgot that . " " The cat ? " Her eyebrows arched . " It can be left with Rosa . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very attached to it . You know when a child is facing a big upheaval in his life it helps him to have some familiar object to cling to . The cat wo n't be any trouble . I thought I would take it to the vet tomorrow and get the necessary papers . " " I see . " She shrugged , dismissing the subject . " Was the fitting satisfactory ? " " Oh yes . They said they 'd have everything ready by Saturdayafternoon . " She nodded . Of course they would have everything ready . Her pen hovered over a fresh sheet of paper , and I said , " I can see you 're busy . Please go on with whatever you were doing . Can I help in any way ? " " Thank you , no . Unless you will be good enough to ring for Emilia . I must just finish this note and then I will join you . " Emilia responded to my touch on the bell , and as she arranged glasses and carafe on the table , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's disposal . A little pressure of a single finger , the contraction of a few small muscles , could produce an industrious bustle of activity . It would be fatally easy to become accustomed to controlling other people 's lives with one push of a button.  |p235When  Francesca sat down beside me she again apologized for her distraction . " There is always so much to do when one travels . " " I 've been trying to get organized too , " I said . " Maybe I should return that rental car tomorrow , instead of waiting till Sunday . Would it be possible for Alberto to drive me back ? " " Of course . " Her smile was warmer . She approved of that idea . ( Do n't ask why , do n't try to find double entendres and hidden meanings  --  you 're far beyond that now . Just stick to your plan . ) She had left the businesswoman at her desk and was now the charming hostess , but there was a change in her manner  --  not so much nervousness as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , I would have supposed she was looking forward to her trip . ( 11 principe , monsieur le comte , waiting in a secluded chalet in the Swiss Alps . ) Her moments of dreamy abstraction and her veiled glances at me  --  glances that seemed to hold a greedy pleasure  --  began to wear on my nerves . I wondered if I could get through the evening after all . Unwittingly , Francesca provided a distraction . " I have asked Professor Brown to join us for dinner . I felt I owed him that , since he will be leaving soon . " I had been careful to avoid David . Guilty or innocent , Francesca'saccomplice or independent villain , he was not a factor in my plans , only an obstacle to be avoided at all costs . I was not happy at the prospect of spending an evening in his company . Francesca saw my reaction and appeared to be amused by it . " I hope you wo n't be too bored , Kathleen . " " He does tend to go on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But one last evening wo n't kill me . " At least I hoped not . David was wearing a proper shirt , for once , with a **29;13076;TOOLONG him . ' Cause I thought if I could just catch his attention maybe it would help . But he was walking so fast , from my left to my right , and I made my eyes go to the left and as he went to the center I made my eyes go straight ahead  --  and he looked at me  --  I thought I was safe . Only he looked away . I wanted to die right then , I knew I was going to die right then , except I kept my eyes on him  --  he was past me now but I made my eyes go to the right and he glanced back and then he stopped and stared and then he moved back toward the center of the pile and I made my eyes go that way and the next thing he was hollering , Get this one here get this one here  --  we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle . " That was when I left the dead pile . They kept me alive and later they moved me back to a real hospital , and they put a plate in my head and after that I went to England for a long time until I was ready for discharge , and that was a lot of pain , those months , but I did n't mind because of one thing : I knew then I was special . I was the only one lifted off the dead pile and that was because I was special . When I went back to work at Finkelstein 's I knew I was special and when I started my company I knew I was special and when it went bad I knew it was only temporary , because I was special , and all these years I knew what I was going through was only a tunnel , and I was going to come out bright and shining on the other end because I was the one that left the dead pile , I was special . " Another bottle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today once and forever . I could n't even find a tailor 's thimble in a dime store . Nothing special about a man like that . " And now , as Chub watched , his father 's body convulsed and the big man was crying . He turned his face into the pillow and Chub went to him . Mike was trying to say something and it took Chub awhile to figure it : " I wanted so bad to be special , Charley . " Over and over . Chub sat beside his father , massaged his neck , rubbed his back , took off the old man 's shoes . " I really need to be alone , Charley . " " Not with those bottles . " " Take ' cm . But Jesus Christ , leave me alone . " Chub grabbed up the full bottles and left him alone . Ile wentp101down to the kitchen , unscrewed the bottles , poured the contents into the sink , dumped the bottles into the garbage can , put the lid on . Then he took the lid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . He put them into a thick plastic garbage bag , put that bag inside another , went to the tool chest and found a hammer . He went outside in the back and knelt by a tree , placing the plastic on a protruding root . And as his father wept upstairs , Chub went through his ritual in the open air , because his anger was out of control and he pounded the hammer against the bag until his arm was hard to raise . There were no lumps left inside the plastic . He had , he hoped , reduced the containers to sand . Sweating  --  it was hot for May  --  he sat against the tree , getting his wind . Then he got up , dumped the remnants of the bottles into the large outside garbage can . It was after five-thirty when he entered his room and probably five-thirty-five before it hit him : His father would never have given up his treasures so easily if he did n't have their equal and more squirreled away someplace . He stood in his room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father down . There is a psychological theory that can be summarized thus : If a vagrant sees an apple tree and his desire for food is sufficient , he will risk climbing the tree for the fruit . If his fear of falling has dominance , he will walk away . But if his fear and his desire are roughly equivalent , he will simply stand at the tree and stare . Chub stayed in his room and stared at the wall . His desire to help his father had been etched on record over the past years . But his fear of what he might find now  --  either the man drinking again or crying helplessly into his pillow  --  was something he could not shake . For a moment he simply stood frozen . Then he walked around in a pointless circle . Then he reached into his desk drawer and got out his old Duncan yo-yo and began to play with it . Finally he put the toy away and got to work on his paper . Joseph Glidden had invented barbed wire in 1874 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead of being forced to let their cattle run free , ranchers now had a way of marking off their territory and keeping their livestock controlled . Giant empires began . Land wars intensified . Rich men were murdered and others hired murderers for protection . The entire western United States began an upheaval that  --   |  --  thatChub looked at his research , looked at what he had written , looked at his watch -- half past six . He stood . The fear that had held him an hour ago was present but weaker . His desire was enough now , so he got up and left his room and walked to the back of the house to look in on his father . From the hall he could not see much of the room , just the dark-blue rug . He crept inside , a step at a time , and even though it was bright outside , his first thought was of a dark-blue sky filled with glisteningstars . The sky had fallen into the spare room and Chub marveled at how incredibly beautiful it was , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , and how long the image held he was n't sure , probably a few seconds only , before he realized the stars were pills and as he was in full view of the room he saw his father sprawled on the floor with the large empty medicine bottle by his body -- Chub knelt  --  Mike was breathing  --  Mike w a s definitely sti I I breathing  --  Chub stood  --  ran for the phone  --  called the hospital  --  the ambulance came  --  he rode inside with Mike to the emergency room  --  they took Mike on a stretcher inside  --  doctors were there  --  they put Mike onto a table  --  the doctors started to work  --  the door was closed  --  Chub waited outside  --  on a bench outside  --  waitedthena friendly nurse  --  she sat beside him  --  " Are you with Mr. Fuller ? "  --  " I 'm his son . "  --  " Then could you help me with a few of these questions ? "  --  she held a form  --  " Address ? " Chub blinked  --  " Address ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , he 's dead . "  --  Chub burst from her  --  into the room with the table  --  his father still there  --  Chub flung himself across his father 's body  --  some doctors tried to intercede  --  Chub grabbed his father 's arm , felt for pulse  --  and it was there , the pulse was still beating  --  he told them  --  It 's heating . '  --  theywould n't feel  --  he told them louder  --  he told them screaming  --  they would n't  --  would n't  --  they gave him something  --  something to calm  --  he called home  --  Gretchen answered  --  " Where are you ? " she asked  --  Chub told her  --  she came  --  they left  --  the mourning  --  the funeral  --  her Moods building  --  the days going by -- and in the days and months to come , Chub would often stop on a street and whirl , because down the way , just turning a corner ,  |p103he  saw his father walking . Sometimes he would even chase the figure until he saw it was only someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same way . Finally Chub made himself try to believe that his father was truly beneath the tombstone . But it was n't the Nembutal that put him there . It was his very own chickenshit fear . For surely , if he had been able to conquer it and not play with his yo-yo and work on his Glidden , the world would have had a different environment ; yes , surely , he had put his father in the ground ... . Until he began trying to deal with this material , Chub had never had all that much trouble writing . The normal panics , the inability to start , all those and more were standard . But once he was under way , once he had a stretch of uninterrupted time , he did n't suffer a whole lot . But this story ( he finally decided , halfway through , to title it " The Tailor 's Thimble " ) made up for all that . The memories he needed to dredge , the guilts that surfaced , racked him . And the material kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Where did you properly climax ? He was dealing , he supposed , with the most incandescent event of his life and the heat kept him at bay . He had two weeks  --  Kitchel would be back by then and he had to have it ready  --  and as he began , he thought that would be more than enough time . But he could n't make it come alive . The first week was a waste  --  sludge , crap , garbage  --  and halfway into the second week he was drinking more than he ever had . His head hurt in the mornings  --  no hangover is worse than a 3.2-beer hangover  --  and that did n't aid his cause . But it was , in his head , somehow that  --  a cause  --  and finally the story began to open . He stayed up the final forty-eight hours before vacation ended . And then he had it  --  the longest piece he 'd ever tried . Fifty pages . And he knew , as he held it at last in his hands , that maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of real writers , but he also knew that it was by far the finest thing he 'd ever done . What Two-Brew might think , though , was up for grabs . In the preceding six months , Stanley Kitchel had become , in his own words , " irreversibly insufferable . " And all because of one Emma I leather Lathery . In June , after Chub deposited Kitchel in his home and had hisp104first encounter with Manhattan , he returned to Oberlin for the summer , did a bunch of jobs around campus , wrote when he could . He had been back less than two months when a thick envelope arrived in the mail . It was a Xerox of a badly typed book entitled The Bluest Eyes in Africa together with a note from Two-Brew saying , in its entirety : " Your immediate reaction is demanded . " Chub read it that night . The chapters were very short and the first one went like this : The man was white , his body tan , his hair the color of sky at evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half feet high , and everything about him was massive where bulk was needed , slim where slenderness the aim . The girl was white , her body pale , her hair the color of wheat at harvest , her eyes like lush grass after a rain . She stood five and a half feet high and everything about her spoke of feminine perfection , curved and rounded and soft , belying the underlying strength of both soul and body . She wore her nurse 's uniform . He wore .. . He wore .. . He started toward her slowly through the lush African veldt . She closed her eyes . She was a nurse , experienced in theways of men , but still she closed her eyes . " Go , " she managed . " If I leave , you will be dead , madam . " She opened her eyes , began to turn . " If you move , you will be dead , madam . BELIEVE ME . " Such was his tone she could do nothing . " There is a spitting cobra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move slowly , and you move not at all , perhaps we shall laugh about this later . " He spoke no more but behind her now , she could hear something . He came closer , closer still , closer till within arms ' grasp of her -- Then his giant body sprang like a champion diver entering a blessed pool -- When she turned , the cobra was dead in his giant hands.  |p105From  then on things really got bad . She was a nurse . She was engaged . He was a scientist . He had amnesia . They kept saving each other in an Africa remarkably less authentic than Burroughs 's . At the end they were in love . But she still had her fiance . His amnesia was cured by a fall , which was good , only among the things he remembered was a wife back home . On that note , the book ended . Chub shot Two-Brew an air mail letter saying , in its entirety : " Would make a great sketch for Carol Burnett and Harvey Korman . " The rest was silence : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to New York a second time and after a couple of good days , he and Two-Brew began the drive back to school . They were barely out of Manhattan and on the Jersey Turnpike when Two-Brew said , " Fuck you with your Carol Burnett and Harvey Korman . " " Just trying to be kind . " Two-Brew turned in his seat , punched Chub on the arm . " That , " he said , " was for not recognizing genius . I was speaking , obviously , of myself . " " Somehow I guessed . " " As you may or may not know , Fuller , publishing houses have slush piles where smartasses fresh from the Ivy League deal with unsolicited manuscripts . I have worked on the slush pile at Sutton for the last two summers . Last year I found nothing . But this year  --  on my second day  --  lo  --  The Bluest Eyes in Africa appeared . Totally dog-eared . God knows how many houses it had been to . And there was an accompanying scrawl from the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was the first of a twelve-book saga she had spent her years completing . I almost put it down after the first pages . Most would have . But that special wisdom that only I seem to possess made me endure . And by the end I thought , I think she actually believes this . ' I phoned her and went to visit  --  she 's this dotty old crippled lady who lives in Nutley , New Jersey . She 's spent her entire existence in Nutley , New Jersey . I asked to read the next few books , and when I did , I asked my father to read just the first . Now , being a publisher , I knew full well my father never reads anything , but he has lackeys and when they gave him their reports , 1 requested a meeting . " " Requested a meeting ? " Chub said . " With your own father ? Could n't you have just talked to him during dinner ? "  | " Fool . Of course I could n't . This had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour just to let me know what a prick he was and then his secretary ushered me into his sanctum sanctorum . Being an intellectual , he began our encounter on the highest of levels : Stanley , ' he said . What is this shit ? " Father , ' I said . When my beloved sister Paige turned twenty-one , you gave her a BMW plus a trip to Brazil for new breasts . I have no plans on tampering with my bosom , and clearly a car will never be of much use to me . Did you plan to give me a present on my twenty-first ? ' He said that he did , though I suspect he 'd forgotten it was coming up . Well , here is what I want  --  I want you to publish this and option the others . Paperback original . Right away . It ca n't cost you much more than what you spent on Paige , and I 'd guess a good deal less . ' " " Did he say yes ? " Chub asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports at me and said , She does n't know squat about Africa . ' I said that did n't matter , because she believed in the love story . And I pointed out that Harlequin was making a fortune on this kind of thing . Then I hit him with the clincher : I 've got the advertising line for the jacket . The geography may not be authentic  --  but the passions are real . ' " " Aw , shit , " Chub said . " What 's wrong ? " " I hate to say what I 'm gon na say  --  but that 's really good . " Two-Brew beamed . " So my father thought . As did the head of our paperback arm . The book is going full speed ahead and will come out in November . I 'm going to be irreversibly insufferable from now on , I fear . The book will be a smash . " ( It was or it was n't , depending on your definition of " smash . " Four hundred thousand copies sold . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to half a million . The third  --  The Coldest Eyes in England  --  was the breakthrough . Triple the second . Six years later , by the time the " Eyes " saga was done  --  all Emma Heather 's books had that word in the title , as all the Travis McGees had a color  --  sales were close to twenty milion copies . In the United States alone . She also did extraordinarily in Canada , England , Australia and , for reasons no one could fathom , Hong Kong . One movie and one television series had also been made . ( Not to mention a fortune for Sutton Press . ( Plus Stanley Kitchcl 's reputation . Ile was the one who discov/ered Emma Heather Lathery . People in publishing never forgot that  --  twenty million copies tends to linger in the memory . ) It was late and starting to snow when Two-Brew returned from vacation . " Young Lochinvar has returned , " he announced , barging into Chub 's room without knocking . " Minnie insisted I bring you sustenance , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minnie , the Kitchels ' maid , had taken a liking to Chub since his first visit when he asked her if he could do anything to help . " That boy will make his mark , " she told anyone in the Kitchel household who would listen . ) " Fudge brownies . " " Trade you , " Chub said , taking the food , handing over " The Tailor 's Thimble . " " More of your juvenile prattling ? Excellent  --  I needed a cure for insomnia . " Very carefully Chub said , " Your immediate reaction is demand-ed . " It came in the middle of that night  --  Chub and Two-Brew had adjoining rooms and Chub was awakened by a pounding on his wall . Two-Brew always whacked at the wall with a crutch whenever he was ready to go to class or dinner or a flick . Chub had a hard time coming to . It was four and outside the snow was turning into a blizzard . Chub got up , went to his door , opened it . His story was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slashed really , three large wordsWRONG ! WRONG ! WRONG ! Chub , stunned , stared at the page . It was the worst criticism he 'd gotten and this was the best writing he 'd ever done . Two-Brew had to be mistaken , only Two-Brew did n't make mistakes  --  not on his stuff anyway . Chub took the story , went back to his bed , lay flat and stared quietly out at the snow . Confidence was never his longest and strongest and he started looking at the pages , flicking through , not reading it at all . He shook his head and wondered . A few minutes later Kitchel entered , wearing plaid pajamas . " I expected you to come roaring in for combat . "  |p108After  a while Chub said , " Tomorrow we 'll talk . " " No sir , we will not talk tomorrow . I 'll get dressed , you do the same , let 's go for a walk , " and he pivoted on his crutches , left . ( Chub knew then that something was up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than rain . And there was ice on the ground before the snow began . Sometimes he fell . More than sometimes . ( The walk was n't all that long  --  less than half an hour . But as the years rolled , it became a fly in amber for Chub . He forgot nothing . ) They met outside their rooms in five minutes and moved silently through the dorm halls . Chub opened the main door of the dorm , Two-Brew took the steps carefully , and then they started toward Tappan Square , through the cold and swirling night . " I have to talk about myself a little bit , " Two-Brew began , and there was none of the brashness about him . " All my freak years in Manhattan , I 've been preparing myself . I did n't go to Harvard/Yale/ Princeton/Brown because every other shit at Dalton went there . I needed to come someplace where no one knew me , and I did . I want to be the best editor and the best publisher and since I did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've read . There 's a story Father told me about a remark that was made at Knopf  --  that 's the best publisher , or it was when this remark was made . The year Camus won the Nobel and one editor said to another , Did you hear ? Al got the nod . ' They were n't hysterical because they have a ton of Nobel writers on their list . No big deal for them . Well , I want that for Sutton , but I want more . I want to publish shit that sells  --  but good shit . And I want to publish quality . I want it all and that nut woman whose book I sent you , she 's one kind of writer . And you 're going to be the other if I have to kill you . " Chub was silent . They were almost at the Square now , and Chub took it slowly as they crossed toward the trees . " Now your story  --  " "  --  I thought it was the best I 'd ever done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wonderful writing , but  --  " And now one crutch hit a patch of ice and Two-Brew tried to brace himself but no way , and he fell sprawling . Chub dropped alongside him , started to lift . " I 'm quite capable myself now get the fuck away . " Chub watched in silence as Kitchel got his crutches , tried to leverage them so he could rise , but they slipped again . ' l'he secondp109time he made it and then he was talking again exactly where he 'd been . "  --  but it 's wrong . All all all dead wrong . " Wonderful writing , Chub thought . That was the best he 'd ever gotten . From anyone , let alone Kitchel . He began to relax . As long as someone thought he was talented , he could deal with anything . " Two things are crucially incorrect  --  first , what you 've done is write about how guilty you feel . What 's that line ?  --  Every suicide kills two people ' ?  --  It 's old news , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going , and you skilled your way along , but alas , not to much avail . Your father did n't die because of you and your goddamn barbed-wire paper . He was already a corpse , it was just a matter of when he decided to finally lie down  --  he would have killed himself anyway . " In the middle of the square now . Two-Brew started to slip again . Chub made no move to assist . Kitchel got his balance back unaided . " Second and the most important thing I 've ever said to you  --  it should n't be a story , Chub , it 's a novel and it should n't be about you but about your father . " Chub stopped . Kitchel turned on him and his voice began to build . " It 's fabulous material  --  and it 's yours and you can write the shit out of it . A guy  --  no schooling  --  gets a job  --  does okay  --  then the Army and that incredible stuff when he 's tossed in with the corpses . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel the belief that he 's special . And he is . And then the wife forces him out on his own . This is America and America 's about success and what kills your father is n't that he failed , it 's that he succeeded  --  and then the alcohol . Do n't you see ? It will make an incredible book . " Two-Brew went on , getting more and more excited , and Chub resisted as long as he could but eventually he began to see that Two-Brew was right . And once he came to admit that , he felt terrified . " I ca n't write a novel  --  I 'm twenty-one , for Chrissakes . " " Vidal did at nineteen but let that pass . This book should be called The Dead Pile and I 'm not saying write it now , stay with the short stuff now , but when we 're done and out of here , that book could make you . Believe me . This material cries out to go where I 'm suggesting . Do you agree ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you frightened ? "  | " Yes . " " Excellent : Anyone can be a writer ; to be a good writer , you have to feel panic . And never lose your sense of revenge . " He paused . " We 're understood then ? " " You may be . " " It 's very simple  --  when we graduate , we will go to New York and you will live in a pit and scribble ; I will luxuriate and shape . " Chub watched as Two-Brew balanced on one crutch , slashed at the storm with the other . " It 's all going to be so goddamn wonderful  --  I'mgoing to be your Maxwell Perkins and you 're going to be my star . " In the eighty weeks between the walk and graduation , Chub kept busy . Socially , he stayed with Patty McLean , who lived off campus and was as obsessed with psychology as he was with writing , so there was no pressure for Commitment ; they liked each other , both as friends and bed partners ; no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He managed to turn out thirty-seven pieces of fiction ( garnering from Two-Brew sixteen " Byuk " s and twenty-one " On to the next " s ) . Two of the stories were printed in the Oberlin lit magazine , of which Kitchel was the editor , Andrew Cheyney the advisor . Cheyney and Chub had a rapprochement , and it was n't long before Cheyney was convinced that he was Chub 's discoverer , because Serendipity published a second story , " Eight Ninety-Five , " and Chub was also printed in Prairie Schooner and the Evergreen , Kenyon and Hudson reviews . He also worked nights at the library and typed endless papers for other students for fifty cents a page . He was , no doubt , busy as hell . But what he did , most of all , was fret about New York . Because the dream  --  double dream , actually , of not just writing but writing there  --  did n't deal much with reality . Chub did some research of his own in the library , figuring what it would cost to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being what he figured it would take to do The Dead Pile . And the answer was approximately fifteen thousand dollars . Fifteen thousand . He had earned , from his published work , three hundred and sixty-two big ones , and that was spent as soon as the checks arrived . Sure , he could go to the city like everybody else and get ap111job waiting tables and write when he was n't  --  except he knew that was disaster . He needed time when he worked . A stretch all his own . Twelve-hour days , fifteen when the going got good . He was never much when he had to snatch two hours here , another three the day after . The answer , the only answer , that seemed satisfactory was a full scholarship to a decent grad school in or near Manhattan . That way he could study toward a doctorate , which he 'd thought about before he ever even came to Oberlin . He 'd get someplace cheap to live in or around campus , he 'd type papers or something to stay ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Between Christmas , spring and summer that was four months plus . School for eight , the rest his own for writing . Writing there . He was a bit dismayed to find only four places that gave Ph.D . ' s in English in the area . Columbia , NYU , City , and St. John 's . He applied to them all early in his senior year , got through his Grad Record Exams breezing . On one remarkable April morning of his senior year , Chub heard from all four . And they all rejected him . Forget the full scholarship , they would n't even take him . Staring at the letters , Chub could feel the center starting not to hold . Because it was n't possible  --  he 'd been published . He 'd included Xerox copies of his stories with his admission applications . It had to be a mistake  --  he locked himself in his dorm room trying to figure it out . It did n't take long . In all he 'd been doing the last year and a half , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  school . His grade curve was fine the first two years  --  " A " s mostly  --  but junior year he 'd managed only one " B-plus " and first semester this year he 'd gotten a preponderance of " C " s . When he was steady , he hurried to the employment office  --  it was late  --  he 'd never conceived somebody would n't accept him . The best the employment office could come up with was a nibble as an instructor at someplace called Central Piedmont , a tiny college outside of Evansville , Indiana . " Do n't take it ! " Two-Brew said . They were having coffee in a corner of the Campus Restaurant with graduation only three weeks away.  | " Teaching is not so terrible . " " Especially at Central Piedmont  --  why , only last year the freshmanclass had an IQ average of close to ninety . " " I 've checked it out a little  --  it 's got a very nice reputation around Evansville . " " Do you hear what you 're saying ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary ? " " Seven thousand . " " And what do you expect to live on ? " " Hundred a week . " " Which comes to a saving of two thousand a year . Only it wo n't ' cause you 'll need wheels . And you need fifteen thousand . You may actually get to New York by the twenty-first century . " " Knock it off , all right ?  --  I do n't need this . " " You do  --  you fucking well do  --  do n't you understand ? If you take the job , you wo n't write . " " Oh , bullshit  --  teachers get a lot of time off . " " Let me outline your future , " Two-Brew said . " You will spend the first year stuffing Mill on the floss down the throats of cretinish freshmen . That 's if you 're lucky  --  instructors always get the shit courses  --  you 'll probably get four sections of English composition  --  thoughthey may not get to that at Central Piedmont till sophomore year . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand . Two-Brew put a crutch on one of Chub 's shoulders , forced him down . " That was the good part I just told you . And you actually may write that first summer . But then you 'll start to get lonely . Lonely is not so terrific , but lonely in Evansville squares that . And you 'll need somebody . And you 'll find her . And she 'll be okay . Sweet . And she 'll think you 're wonderful . And I 'll come to your wedding and you 'll be smiling like a bastard but inside you 'll be dead and I 'm right and you know it . " Chub blew into his coffee . " Go home , why do n't you  --  sponge  --  write there . " Chub just looked at him . " I 'm sorry , " Two-Brew said . " I forgot you do n't have one . " Chub said nothing , sipped the last of his coffee . " Come to the city , for Chrissakes . Give it a shot . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fall flat on myp113ass and leave in a year . When I have the money , I may not make it , but at least I 'll have a leg up . And Central Piedmont will be fine . " " Spelled d-o-o-m , ' " Two-Brew concluded . Whether Kitchel was being overly melodramatic or not turned out to be beside the point . The week before graduation Central Piedmont called to say , with some embarrassment , that they had located another teacher who had a master 's and they hoped Chub understood . Chub was very polite . But how the center was shattering . Graduation came , and while he was going through the paces , Chub knew he was blocking it all . Gretchen could n't come up so he spent most of his time with the Kitchels . After the ceremony , he went to Patty McLean 's and helped her parents load her stuff into their station wagon . It took awhile but he enjoyed the physical labor and then they embraced and she was gone . Two-Brew was gone too . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sentiment does not become us ; we shall meet at Philippi . " Chub packed . The dorms were closing for the summer so he had to get out and there was a small room over Gibson 's bakery that rented by the week so he took it . Then he heard about a summer replacement job at the No-Name and the guy who owned the place always liked Chub because of the beer-drinking contest and when he said yes so did Chub . Working the No-Name did n't pay much , but there was n't much work to do . You sold 3.2 by the glass or pitcher , you sold Coke and ginger ale by the bottle . And since the place survived on college trade , it was mostly empty in summertime . Dr. Wallinsky was there every day , of course , drunk usually when he arrived . Sometimes Wallinsky would reminisce hazily about his Oberlin days , forty years earlier . Before he went off to Yale and got his doctorate in languages . It seemed to Chub that all language had left him  --  his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chub about the great beer-drinking contest and how thrilling it had been , and at least twice a week he would ask , " Where 's that crip ? Have n't seen the crip much lately , " and Chub would explain patientlythat Stanley Kitchel was starting his career now in New York in his father 's publishing firm . Satisfied , Dr. Wallinsky would usually retreat to his favorite table in the corner and watch the bubbles in his beer flatten . And it also seemed to Chub , watching him , that there was a storyp114in there someplace  --  maybe thirty years down the line he would be watching the bubbles flatten  --  only he did n't feel much like writing it . June was dry and steaming , and the No-Name was air-conditionedbut not his room over the bakery . The smells that rose from below were wonderful but sleep was hard to come by . Chub developed a taste for Wild Turkey . He 'd walk out of the town limits to the nearest liquor store and buy a bottle or two . Every night he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , but it helped him to doze off . And it helped him to try and figure things . Because that was what was important  --  his next move and what and where . He had always thought teaching would be good , but now that did n't appeal much . He was sick of school and he could n't afford to go on . Probably there was some graduate faculty somewhere  --  there had to be  --  that would give him at least a partial scholarship but he would be wasting his time and their money . He was twenty-two  --  born with the half century  --  and he had a degree in English and that was n't worth a whole lot . Starting factory work , assuming there were job openings , averaged just under four bucks an hour and that did n't appeal to him much either . But to hell with " appeal , " he had to strike out somewhere , and he could handle the language and in the back of his head there was always the thought of working as a copywriter for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  if he could get a job there he 'd at least have an honorable line of endeavor and he 'd be where he so desperately wanted to be . But what if the New York agencies said no ? He spent three days typing up an acceptable resume and then researched the half dozen leading agencies in Cleveland . If he was wanted there , he might accept , but then again he might not , might just sail with that confidence toward Magic Town . The Cleveland agencies , all six , said no . Chub sat in his room over the bakery , wondering if he 'd somehowfallen like Alice , only this was no wonderland . Three months ago he was on the come , on a roll , moving like a bastard . He would not allow himself to believe the roll was finished , but he sure would n't have objected strongly to a little evidence to the contrary . Then , thank God , came the brick factory.  | " Is this the Elyria Brickworks ? " Chub said into the phone in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , my name is Charles Fuller and I 'm calling from Oberlin . I saw your ad in the Elyria paper this morning . It said you had openings with top pay . ' " " That was my ad , I run the place . I 'm Mulloy . " " I 've got to tell you , Mr. Mulloy , I do n't have any previous experience . " " None required . " " Could you tell me what the top pay ' is ? " " Yessir , seems only fair I do that . Starting out is ten bucks per hour , forty-hour week . Non-union . I wo n't let those fuckers near me . Chub closed his eyes and started figuring . Ten times forty was four hundred times fifty-two -- no , make it fifty , easier to multiplywas  --  wastwenty thousand dollars the first year . He could be in New York by next summer . " Overtime starts at fifteen . Saturdays . Eight hours . We usually need overtime . " How much was that ? Thousands ; it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You 're having it , Mr. Fuller . It 's not the hardest work in the world to learn . You live in Oberlin ? " " I just graduated . " " Very hoity-toity  --  only joking  --  I wo n't hold it against you . Got a car ? " " Nossir . " " Well , you wo n't need one . Just take the Oberlin bus past the center of town here  --  Main  --  get off and walk two blocks south . Can you handle that , did you take geography ?  --  only joking ; I do that a lot . " " Yessir , I can handle it . " " I 'll be here at eight-thirty . Good-bye , Fuller . " Chub was outside the Elyria Brickworks at seven  --  forty-five . Until he actually saw the place he worried that the whole thing was some cosmic put-on applied for his benefit . After the past months , he did n't feel his paranoia was unjustified . At eight-thirty Mr. Mulloy arrived . Leprechaun type . He remindedp116Chub of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was young . They talked a little  --  Mr. Mulloy had a niece who he said was smart as a whip and was thinking of Oberlin and what was Chub 's opinion of the place ? Chub gave it high marks , they had coffee out of plastic containers and then when it was almost nine , Mr. Mulloy gestured for Chub to follow . They entered a small shed where half a dozen middle-aged men were grouped , talking . " This here 's Fuller and he went to college and I want him treated with respect . " " Hi , " Chub said . They kind of grumbled and went back to their conversation . Chub put on his newly purchased work gloves while Mr. Mulloy pointed around . There was a chute in the center of the shed and a number of chairs set alongside . He ushered Chub toward the front chair . " Here 's the drill  --  bricks are made behind that wall there "  --  Chub nodded  --  " and then they come down this chute here and what you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see those boxes alongside ? " Chub nodded again . " Well , when the bricks get to you , you lift ' em , two at a time , and you put ' em in the box . When the box is full , give a holler , I got a kid with a wagon who 'll come take the box away , give you a new empty . Got it ? " " I just reach over into the chute , take two bricks , stack them in the box ? " " College boys , God love ' em  --  just joking . " Then there was a whistle and Chub sat in the lead chair , turned , smiled at the middle-aged guys behind him . They were n't the friendliest but probably he would n't have been either if he 'd been a veteran and a new kid came along . At nine it got noisy and the bricks began coming down the chute . At first , Chub had trouble  --  asshole  --  getting the hang of it right ; the bricks were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd remembered to buy the gloves yesterday . But it was , he soon realized , a rhythm . You reached over with your hands to the right , grabbed the bricks , brought them across your body , put them carefully into the box . He was pleased at how easily they stacked and inside of five minutes , he called out , " New box , please , " and as if on cue , a kid arrived with a wagon , gave Chub an empty . It was n't for a few minutes more till the old guys began needing new boxes and Chub knew he 'd made a mistake working too fast.  |p117He  was going to be practically living with them for the next year , and the last thing they needed was a show-off in their midst . So he began , carefully , to slow his rhythm down . The second box was filled at the same time as several of the others and that was good . " New box , " Chub shouted at nine-twenty-five , his mind set now on the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be a lot more money but six days a week did n't allow for much writing time . The work required no mental strain and he could easily figure out what to write while he worked , maybe take a few notes at lunch break , and do his own work on weekends . It was hot now in the shed and Chub stood quickly after he 'd finished another box and took off his shirt , tossed it close by . There was a lot of dust , too , and he quickly figured not to inhale when he was reaching for the bricks , because that was where the dust was heaviest . You exhaled while picking them up , breathed in while you did your stacking . By ten he was bored but that was fine  --  one hour meant ten bucks and he wondered if Mr. Mulloy paid by the day or the week or what  --  he should have asked but he was too nervous to . Probably by the week . Probably by the four-hundred-dollar week . Would it be in cash or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " meant and cash would have been better but what the hell , four hundred was four hundred and fifty times four hundred was New York and two free years and sonofabitch if that was n't worth all the boredom you could eat and then some --  " Son of a bitch , " Chub said out loud , angry at his goddamn fingers for starting to cramp on him , but he quickly took care of that , stretched them back to normal without missing a brick and "  --  what the hell shit , " Chub said as someone put a knife into his shoulder blades . He gasped with the sudden pain , but then it dulled , there was no knife , it was his shoulders locked into a sudden cramp and as he stood he heard a sound -- behind now , was laughter . Fuck them , Chub thought , and he sat back down and reached out for two more bricks and he had them up off the chute but then as he tried to reach across for the box he dropped them . His shoulderswere worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knelt , managed through his pain to get the bricks into the box , sat , triedp118reaching for two more , got them up , dropped them back down in the chute . And now from behind him came a chant : " Easy money at the brick factory , easy money at the brick factory , " and Chub , in anguishand humiliation , turned and looked at his co-workers and they had their shirts off , too , and he saw that so what if they were older than he was  --  My God , they all had arms like Popeye . " What 's so goddamn funny ? " Chub shouted . " I 'm gon na win  --  " the guy behind him said  --  " we got a pool on how long you 'd last and I picked ten-forty-five . " Chub looked at his watch . Half past ten . " Screw , " he said , and he sat back down and reached out for the bricks . At just before eleven Chub , throbbing , was back in Mr. Mulloy 's office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the shoulders that got you ? It 's usually the shoulders . " Chub was able to make a nod . His neck , at least , still almost worked . " Cramping should be gone by tomorrow , Fuller . Take a nice hot bath , they say that helps . And do n't feel bad  --  the last two kids quit before ten . " Chub , the cramping worse , asked could he have the money he 'd earned . " Ca n't pay you , sorry about that  --  never pay unless there 's a full day 's work , you understand . " Chub stood there , trying to massage his forearms , but his fingers were cramping too badly for anything to be effective . This is funny , he told himself . This is wonderful material . Only he did n't feel much like writing it . Mr. Mulloy walked him to the brickworks entrance . " So long , Fuller  --  if you ever get your arms and shoulders in shape , give a holler  --  I 've always got openings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not home , just back to the room over Gibson 's where he spent the afternoon in the tub , rubbing in Ben-Gay , waiting for his muscles to stop cramping . The bath did n't do much but the Wild Turkey helped , and he and Dr. Wallinsky were both drunk when they entered the No-Name that evening . " It 's the crip ! " Dr. Wallinsky cried the first night in August . The weeks since the brick factory had been bad for Chub ; really thep119worst for Chub , but now he turned and there in the entrance was Two-Brew , dressed in a blue seersucker suit and blue button-down shirt and red tie . " How are things in Glocca Morra ? " Two-Brew said , moving on his crutches toward the bar . There was no one in the bar except the three of them . " Swamped , " Chub said . Kitchel smiled , took a seat , and they shook hands . " You look good , " Chub said . " Not exactly sylphlike , but immacu-late . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you doing here ? " Two-Brew sighed . " My prick father insisted I spend the day in glorious Cleveland . We 've got a hot-shot doctor at Western Reserve who 's doing a diet book for us . Only he 's late . We 're in deep on our advance so Father said I should see him and explain how thrilled we are that the book is coming along so well . But the subtext was : Where is the goddamn thing ? Father believes in scaring writers , especially when he 's paid them money . And I figured , as long as I was in Cleveland  --  may I never see it again please God  --  I 'd say hello . " The clock behind the bar indicated seven-thirty . " I get off at eleven , " Chub said . " Can you spend the night ? " " Ca n't you get off ? I 've got to catch the last plane back and it leaves before eleven . " " Shit , " Chub said . Two-Brew leaned forward on the bar . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've come up with a crazy idea and I want to try it out on you . It could be important . " " I 'll try to pay attention between all my chores . " " Okay  --  it 's crossed my mind that maybe , just maybe  --  " "  --  God , that was a great night , the contest night , " Dr. Wallinsky said , sitting down next to Two-Brew . " I wish we could do it again . " " May all your hopes be granted , " Two-Brew said , turning away from the doctor toward Chub . " What crossed my mind was this  --  " " Nothing 's touched it since , " Dr. Wallinsky said , smiling at them both . " I sec it all plain as yesterday . " " I 'm sorry , Dr. Wallinsky , but we 're trying to talk , " Chub said gently . " I like to talk , " 1 ) r . Wallinsky said . ' Ilien he said , " Oh , you meanp120talk " He asked for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner . " You know all those stories you 've fumbled out over the last couple of years ? All of them about people with different names because of your obsession with Irwin Shaw ? " " I 'm aware of what you 're talking about , " Chub said . " Well , on the plane ride in today  --  maybe I was thinking of our time here , I do n't know  --  but I realized they do n't have to be about different people . The kid who breaks the window with the yo-yo is the same guy really who marries the actress when he should n't . I mean shit , they 're all you . " " I guess maybe . " " Well , what if we took say ten of those stories  --  and did some minor rearranging when necessary  --  and made it all the same people . It 's ripping off Salinger and the Glass family , I know , but if you did what I 'm suggesting , you 'd have the future of a guy growing up , starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's screwing up his life by marrying someone who 's going to slaughter him . I even found you your title . Try this : Under the Weather . " Chub thought a moment . " Good title . " " Put that in your pot and let it stew awhile . " " Why ? " " Because , nerd , publishers hate books of short stories . But if they were connected , there might be more interest . I could bring it up at the next sales meeting . " " That would be fantastic , " Chub said . " Not really . I can go on all night about how it 's not really short stories only they 're dumb but they 're not that dumb . They 'd turn me down . And I , being as is common knowledge , flawless , do n't like being rejected . " Chub poured himself a beer . " But  --  " Two-Brew said then . Chub drank it down. "  --  they might be interested in publishing the book if they knew there was a novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could snooker them , twenty-five hundred would be a reasonable advance on the short stories and maybe fifteen thousand advance on the novel . What I want you to do before I try anything is really ponder do you want the stories changed a little so as to make them more connected . "  | " The answer is yes . There . I 've pondered . " " You fool , " Two-Brew said . Chub looked at him . " You actually believed me . " Chub did n't say anything . " You 're dumber now than when we met and there was n't a lot of room for deprovement . " And now he banged a crutch on the bar and the sound exploded . " I did it , you buffoon ! The sales meeting was today  --  and there is n't any diet doctor in Cleveland  --  the fifth Eyes ' book just hit two million , they could n't turn me down . And even if it had n't they could n't turn me down  --  I was so brilliant , Chubbo  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the corpses and they did n't flicking breathe . " Two-Brew began to cackle now  --  " Look at you  --  your mouth is open  --  Bo-Bo the DogFacedBoy would appear more intelligent . Do n't you understand ? " " Say it slowly . " " Under the Weather will be published in a year . The Dead Pile will follow when finished . " He handed Chub an envelope . " Two checks inside totalling seventeen thousand five . You do n't even have to pay an agent 's fee , you worthless shit . So get ready , Tonto  --  Silver 's hitched outside . " Chub shrieked and leapt over the bar , grabbed one of Kitchel 's crutches and began waltzing with it around the empty room . " What 's up ? " came from the old drunk in the corner . " I 'm going to New York to write a book ! " " I wrote a book once , " Dr. Wallinsky said ... .  |p127Chub  knew he was going to rent the apartment before he ever saw it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West End and Riverside  --  that won him over . Across the way was a Single Room Only hotel , and derelicts lined the sidewalk . Also , it seemed to Chub that an inordinate number of transvestites were in the vicinity . ( This , it turned out , was a permanent part of the area 's ambiance . The block was known as Transvestite Heaven . ) And the tenement was probably not built in this century  --  security seemed nil , the front door opened to anyone who had a shoulder to shove it . The super  --  a heavyset woman named Gonzales  --  sighed when Chub inquired about the " Apt . Avail . " sign in front . " I hope you got strong legs , " she said to him , which made more and more sense to Chub as they began the climb . The empty was on the top-floor rear , ninety-seven steps up from the street . It made the newlyweds ' place in Barefoot in the Park seem like a ground-floor flat . As they paused on the third floor for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's almost got a view of the river . " Chub assumed , correctly , that it did n't have a view at all . Mrs. Gonzales nodded . " If the three buildings over get knocked down , you 'll have a clear shot . But even now , when the wind 's coming in from Jersey , you get the breeze . " Between the fourth and fifth floors , Mrs. Gonzales , perspiring heavily  --  it was late August and the wind was not coming in from Jersey  --  said , " Singer lived here once . " " Which singer ? " Chub asked , trying to keep the conversation going . " The Yid . The Hebrew guy . "  |p128Chub  stopped . " You mean Isaac Singer ? Isaac Bashevis Singer ? The writer ? " " I think . I do n't know for sure . I only been super five years but someone said that once , a long time ago , he did . Maybe . He lives around here now . Should n't be hard to find out if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know , Chub thought . But he knew then thatILI , no matter what lay above him , it was going to be home . Fortunately , what lay above him was n't so bad : two decent-sized rooms overlooking a number of cement courtyards down below . Two large windows in each room . A wall kitchen with little shelf space but who cared , he hated cooking . And a bathroom with both a tub and a shower head and a toilet that almost flushed completely . Chub signed a three-year lease at $285/month , and set out almost immediately for the Salvation Army . Within a week the place was habitable  --  desk , bed , tables , rugs took no time at all . What took him the most time was his wall . He had always wanted a cork wall . Where he could tack notes and anything else that might help jog his memory . He went to a paint store , bought over a hundred squares of brown cork , several large bottles of glue , set to work . He was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the brick factory " ) so it took more time than he thought , but finally he had it done . The entire wall , floor to ceiling , was covered with brown cork . Chub bought a bottle of Wild Turkey , soaked off the label and , when it was dry , tacked it on the wall above his desk . He went to the Strand Bookstore and found an old copy of Oil for the Lamps of China and tacked the jacket beside the liquor label . In an Eighth Avenue pawnshop he found a World War Two Purple Heart and he placed that so that the jacket was tacked between the liquor and the prize . Then he got his notes in order , because he knew he had to have the novel really under way before the reviews came out for his stories . ( He would manage over a hundred pages , protection enough . ) But before he did any of that , the very first thing he tacked up was a small typed note that was eye level as he sat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note read . From The New Yorker : BRIEFLY NOTEDFictionUnder the Weather , by Charles Fuller ( Sutton ; $5.95 ) . A grouping of ten inter-connected stories centered on the growing up of Peter " Pudge " Irwin . Young Mr. Fuller has studied his Salinger and Shaw , to most excellent effect . The book jacket informs that he is at work on a novel ; one can not but await it with interest . From the New York Times Book Review ( reviewed by Joyce Carol Oates , the fourth of four collections of short stories ) : ... It would be logical to expect Mr. Fuller , being the youngest by far of the authors under discussion , to be the most experimental . This is not the case . Any of these stories could have been written in the past forty years . But such is his control of his material that it is impossible to hold that against him . In a relentlessly and unsparinglyugly story , " The Men 's Room at Meroni 's , " the ten-year-old hero waits in a graffiti-scarred hellhole to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so moving is the author 's sure knowledge of shared pain . The final story ( somewhat too cleverly titled " The Girl(s) of My Dreams " ) brings the book full circle and successfully ; the hero is doomed to repeat the mistakes of his parents . One might long for a growing audacity in Mr. Fuller 's future work . But that he has a future is beyond question . Ile already has this considerable achievement behind him  --  at the age of twenty-three . Probably that ought to he enough.  |p130From  the Oberlin Alumni Magazine : Reviewed by Andrew Cheyney : UPDIKE , FULLER AND ROTH ? A presumptuous title ? Without question . Charles Fuller ( ' 72 ) is nearly two decades younger than the others . And I must admit to a certain bias  --  he was a student of mine during his years here , when these stories were written , and I like to think I did not damage his growth . But the growth was inexorable . At similar ages , Updike and Roth had similar accomplishments behind them . And today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . Will Fuller , two decades hence , be among the best we have ? I have neither the space here nor the inclination to detail the stories  --  all Oberlinians should hie to their bookstores and support a fellow alumnus . But it is my hope and firm belief that in time the question mark in my title will be erased . I like to think said title will prove to be precognitive , not presumptuous , after all . Chub read his reviews , both good and bad  --  and there were some bad  --  with great care . The negative notices he went over several times , often taking notes , trying to find a consensus on where he 'd gone wrong . For the raves , his reaction was always the same : " My God , I got away with it . " Considering it was a book of short stories by a total unknown , Under the Weather did well . The first printing of thirty-five hundred copies came close to selling out . ( Eventually , less than three hundredwere returned . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paperback edition , and to celebrate that occasion , Kitchel invited Chub to have lunch . ( The paperback was the shocker . Nothing to compete with Emma Heather Lathery , of course , but it went through five printings , total sales over a hundred thousand . Chub received an offer to lecture for a semester at Iowa , which he politely refused because of his novel . And fifty or so tan letters , all of which he politely answered . ' 11x  --  letters were all from college students and there was a reason fi ) r that . Because , fi ) r one brief month or so , collegians all across the country put down . Sul ( /1w/hap131or Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee and gave Under the Weather a try . ) Chub met Two-Brew in his office at Sutton , and by now he was almost used to Kitchel 's work costume . Blue button-down shirt , grey flannel suit , striped ties from Brooks . Probably the whole works came from there . And Kitchel 's curling hair was normal length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Where 's that pornographic novel you 're working on ?  --  I want your goddamn book . " " It 's coming along , " Chub said . ( It was . He had , that morning , finished page 255 , his father had been planed to England for rehabilitation . What particularly excited Chub was what he had found in his recent research  --  he was totally at ease with the library facilities all over the city by now and it was probably the best in the world . What he had found was a series of marvelous articles in some old medical journals dealing with the salvaging of the woundedduring the war . Not just the delicate operations , but the mental and physical treatments that followed . He had n't quite digested it all yet , but he would soon , and he felt as confident as he ever did that he could write what his father went through and make it work . ) " ' Coming along , ' Fuller , is the writer 's equivalent of the man who owes you money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " " I 'm around two hundred fifty . He 's entering rehabilitation . " Two-Brew groaned . " What are you , a third of the way through ? I do n't want the fucking Forsythe Saga . There go our hospital sales  --  you ca n't push groin-busters to the invalided . They need something they can lift . How dull is it ? " " Oh , it 's very dull , I promise . " " Well , that 's something at least  --  " "  --  May I come in , Stan ? " a female voice asked , and Chub turned to the doorway and was aware , instantly , that Somebody was there . Lydia Katz was wearing a grey tweed skirt and a white buttondownshirt . A red scarf at her neck set off her dark skin and hair . She was tall , five seven , and perhaps inside her was a fat girl trying to get out . But as Chub watched her , the fat girl was losing . She was enormously sensual , but the intelligence was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when she spoke , a slight impedimentwas evident . " Fuller " was never quite " Fuwwer , " though there was no denying that " I " s gave her trouble . Two-Brew started mimicking immediately . " ' May 1 come in ,  |p132Stan  ? May I come in , Stan ? ' Lydia , if you had the least knowledge of spatial relations you would already have deduced that you are in . What you can do is state your business and then go out . " " I do n't even hear it anymore , Stan , " she said , then crossed to Chub , who stood . " We have n't met but I 'm Lydia Katz and I really wanted to meet you . I 'm a real fan and I had to tell you that . " Chub thanked her . She turned then after her smile , went to the door , stopped . " Oh , yes  --  if you ever need a real editor , I 'm just down the hall . " A quick glance toward Kitchel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lydia Katz , for Chrissakes , " Kitchel said when she was gone , his face red with anger . " Have you ever heard a phonier name ? " " How ' bout Paige Kitchel ? " Chub said , mentioning Two-Brew 's sister , whom he had dated after his first reviews came out  --  not for long , though ; she had the habit of always crying after intercourse , which put a permanent damper on things . " We 're entering her in the National Preppy Contest next spring  --  I suspect she sleeps in button-down nighties . " Chub looked at Two-Breeds button-down shirt , said nothing . " Miss Hot Shit  --  the only reason she 's a junior editor is she 's the godchild of one of our vice-presidents . " Chub wondered aloud when Kitchel had turned his back on the glories of nepotism . " I am employed here , shit-for-brains , because of my acumen , sensitivity , and sagaciousness . The fact that Daddums owns the joint is an inconsequential issue . Let 's eat . " Ordinarily , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two-Brew had the pate , anything with a sauce , and either one or more desserts . Now , he explained , he 'd found a new eating experience that surpassed the Frogs . On the street , he took off again on Lydia Katz , on her rudeness and incompetence , her speech  --  " The office Barbara Wah-Wah "  --  and how Yale 's allowing her to graduate two years ago was proof of the fall of the Ivy League. 11 They dined  --  Chub could n't believe it  --  in a vegetarian restaurant . Chub had tuna salad while Two-Brew ordered cottage cheese and carrot strips . As Chub watched his dearest friend down the white curled stuff , he decided that very clearly something was most definitely in the air.  |p133The  situation began to clarify that Saturday when he was studying surgical techniques for head wounds and the phone rang , the caller being Lydia Katz , they had met at Sutton , and could they meet please sometime soon , like , if possible , now . She was standing outside a coffee shop on Ninety-fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September day , and she was wearing jeans , tennis shoes , and a baggy Princeton sweat shirt . " I thought you went to Yale , " Chub said as they sat in a corner and ordered . It was close to eleven in the morning , and the place was empty . " Christ , he ca n't even keep that straight , " Lydia said . Her eyes were red and moist . " Do n't be upset , " Chub said quietly . " I 'm not upset  --  it 's these goddamn contact lenses  --  I switched from my horn-rims a month ago and I 'm in agony and he did n't even notice . " Their coffee came . Chub waited for it to cool . " I do n't suppose I have to identify who he ' is ? " Chub shook his head . " I 'm interested ' in Stanley Kitchel , " Lydia said then . " I was not infatuated at first sight . I almost cried the first time he insulted me and I 'm not a weeper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about revenge . I avoided him at the office wherever possible . My answers , when spoken to , were curt and as cutting as I could make them . But the last couple of months , I do n't know  --  he 's just so flicking weird and I ca n't stop thinking about him . " " If you think he 's bizarre now , you should have seen him in school . " " Okay , here 's why I 'm bugging you  --  you know him better than anybody  --  I think he 's interested in me too . I mean , lately , he 's just been so horrid , that 's got to mean something , do n't you think ? " " With a human being , yes . " Lydia sighed . " You mean he is n't interested ? " " I did n't say that  --  I have seen him with my own eyes eat cottage cheese . He is n't slimming down for the next sales meeting . " " Well Jesus Christ , thank God I 'm not crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup . " What do we do now , Coach ? " Chub shook his head . " It wo n't he easy . " " Did he date at Oberlin ? "  | " I am reliably informed he was sexually active . But he did not socialize to excess . " Lydia nodded . " The goddamn legs . " Then she said , " Do you mind ? " and she turned her head to the wall , took off her contacts , reached into her purse for her horn-rims . " You 're pretty either way , " Chub told her . " I do n't know about that , but I 've never had trouble getting boys before . What the hell can I do , drop my handkerchief ? " " Two-Brew would n't understand that . He 'd just think you were clumsy . " " Look  --  I do n't want his money ; my father owns more stupid McDonald 's franchises than anyone else in New England and he was n't poor going in . And I 'm totally devoid of Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to a basketball player . " Chub looked at her . He had never thought much about Kitchel getting serious with a girl . This one across from him now seemed like a steal . Assuming her skin was thick enough and that no one could predict . " I 'd like to help you get started , " he said . " I just do n't know how . " " What about honesty  --  I could just ask him out , do n't you think ? " " Death . " " Fug , " from Lydia Katz . They sat silently for a few minutes before Chub said it : " Lydia ? " " What ? " " Ask us both out .... " How could you have accepted ? " Two-Brew railed at Chub as they walked through the drizzle on East Eighty-third Street toward the new large , white , boxlike building up ahead . It was Wednesday , several weeks later , and talk of a second printing of the paperback was growing stronger . " Do n't ask that again , huh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the week , you 'll be home early . " " I do not do not do not do not understand ! " " I made a mistake , I 'm sorry  --  when she asked me I thought from what she said you 'd already accepted , so I accepted too . " They entered the building , asked the doorman for Katz , were buzzed on in . At the elevator Chub took off his raincoat . Ile was wearing slacks and a white shirt , open at the throat , and a blazer . When Two-Brew took off his raincoat Chub saw he was wearingp135the kind of jogging suit  --  this one was purple  --  he 'd costumed himself with at school . " Do n't look at me that way , " Two-Brew said . " She said casual '  --  to me this is casual . " Chub just shook his head . They got into the elevator . " The meal will be splendiferous , " Kitchel said . " Our main course will be Eggs McMuffin ; my secretary did some checking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chub watched the numbers above the elevator door . " I 'll tell you something you wo n't believe , Chubbo  --  when she first came to the office , she wore horn-rim glasses ; she was much less unattractive then . " Lydia was waiting in her doorway on the seventeenth floor . She wore dark silk slacks , a white silk shirt , and she ushered them inside . She lived in a large studio apartment . By the kitchen a small table was set up with three place settings , an unlit candle serving as centerpiece . There was n't much view , but the room was not , Chub observed , filled with relics from the Salvation Army . " Really nice , " he said . Two-Brew nodded . " You majored in home economics at Yale ? " " Harvard , Stan . " There was a large couch by the main window , a table in front . There was a bowl of dip surrounded by fresh-cut vegetables . Lydia gestured toward the area . " Why do n't we all sit there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chub and Two-Brew started toward the couch while Lydia darted into the kitchen , returned a moment later with a bottle and glasses . " I thought , in honor of the second printing , we might start with champagne . " " Terrific , " Chub said . " I did n't know Manischewitz made champagne , " Two-Brew said . Chub shot him a look but Two-Brew was already resting his crutches by the back of the couch , dropping heavily down . Lydia got the foil off the champagne but the cork gave her trouble . Chub reached over , took the bottle , began pushing hard with his thumbs . During this , Two-Brew examined the dip . " What is this , calf's-foot jelly made from your own calf ? " " Stan , if you 're going to quote Kaufman and Hart , at least quote Kaufman and I lart . The line is Made from your own foot , I have no doubt . ' "  | " They taught you that at Harvard , I 'm impressed . " " Yale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poured carefully . They lifted their glasses to Under the Weather and drank . " I ca n't wait for your novel , " Lydia said . " You wo n't be able to finish it , my pet ; it 's going to be long and your lips will get tired . " Lydia smiled , looked at Chub . " The terrible thing is , he actually thinks that 's funny . Here 's another new one , Stan : It 's a book , The Yellow River by I. P. Daily . " Chub laughed and started talking quickly . " God , I loved those when I was a kid . The Hole in the Mattress by Mister Completely . The Open Kimono by Seymour Hair . The Russian 's Revenge . . . who wrote that , do either of you guys remember ? " There was n't a lot of interest in pursuing the subject so Chub shut up and drank his champagne . They would have to battle it out themselves . He wondered if Lydia was equal to the task . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the task . Lydia said she 'd just seen Amarcord and Scenes From a Marriage and they were both wonderful . Chub said he totally agreed with her . Two-Brew said he loathed and detested any movies where he had to read . Lydia tried theatre . Equus was in previews and she heard it was wonderful . Chub said he 'd heard the same thing . Two-Brew said he heard it was faggy . " You 'll have to excuse him , " Chub tried then . " He 's had a terrible shock earlier tonight  --  his pet python died . " Two-Brew looked at him contemptuously and bit down loudly on a carrot stick . Eventually , Lydia glanced at her watch and stood . " I 've got to go look in the oven , cross your fingers ; I have n't done much entertainingbefore . " " She still has n't , " Two-Brew said when she was gone . " What was that ? " Lydia called from the kitchen . " He said entertaining was hard , " Chub said quickly . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Kitchel then . " You 've been fabulous so far . " Two-Brew crunched another carrot . Lydia put a glass salad bowl on the table , made another trip for a bottle of red wine . Chub got up to help . Ile stood by the kitchen asp137Lydia emerged carrying a casserole . " This began as beef bourguignon , " she said , putting it on the table . " I 'm not fussy , " Two-Brew said , reaching for his crutches . " Just as long as everything 's dead inside , I sha n't complain . " Chub stood behind Lydia 's chair and pulled it out and she nodded thank you and Kitchel crossed the room toward the table and the candlelight , Chub thought , made Lydia look particularly stunning and even Kitchel had to notice that , so maybe things were on an upward curve now , except they were n't , because as he approached the table one of Two-Brew 's crutches slipped and he screamed out loud and began to fall , grabbing for a chair to support him but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tablecloth and then he was on the floor along with everything else , the salad , the casserole upturned , the emptying bottle of red wine . It took twenty minutes to get it cleaned up , and Two-Brew apologized and Lydia said not to and eventually they ordered in pizza , ate it in silence , and by ten Chub and Kitchel were back in the elevator , heading down . " Prick , " Chub said . Two-Brew said nothing . " Prick , " Chub said again in the foyer . " I apologized plenty , now shut up . " The rain had stopped but it had gotten colder . They started walking away from her building . The street was empty . " What a miserable prick you are . " " And what a glorious vocabulary you have  --  you might consider taking up writing . " " You did it on purpose . " " Did what ? " " Ibis , " Chub cried , and he kicked at Two-Brew 's nearest crutch , watched as Kitchel spun , fell hard to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few feet away . " Admit it . " Two-Brew , stunned , lay where he 'd fallen . " Admit it , prick . " Two-Brew blinked . " You were so chickenshit scared you had to ruin it all . With these . " He lifted the crutches into the air . " Boy , these fucking things make you king of the world , do n't they . " Two-Brew reached for his crutches . Not till you admit it . "  |p138Two-Brew  crawled toward a car , began pulling himself up . Chub poked his hands with the crutches and Two-Brew fell again . " Chickenshit and dumb  --  she 's not interested in you , she 's interested in me . " " Is she ? " " Never shit a shitter . You know goddamn well what she 's interested in  --  it 's your money . " " She has money , " Two-Brew said . " Then there 's only one answer is n't there ?  --  She 's got a thing for freaks . You buy that ? " Two-Brew reached for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please . " Admit it . " Two-Brew sat huddled on the sidewalk for a long time . Then he said , " ... I thought the chair would hold me .... I never meant to pull everything ... everything over like that .... " Chub dropped the crutches alongside Kitchel , started walking away . " Wait . " Chub kept on walking . " Chuuuuub ! " The tone was so whipped Chub pivoted . " What 'll I do ? " " You might go back and apologize . " " I could n't do that . " He forced his crutches into position , got to his feet . " You see that , do n't you ? " " I just see you , and I do n't like it . " " What if she wo n't talk to me ? " " I hope she wo n't . No . I hope she does and takes your fucking head off . " He turned again and walked away until he was out of sight around the corner . Then he looked back . Two-Brew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited . Finally , when Two-Brew went in , Chub went home ... . The following months were almost more than Chub 's stomach could stand  --  Two-Brew was in love before November and he took to calling Chub at all hours and singing , " Ahhhh , sweet mystery of life at last I 've found you , " before hanging up . When the three ofp139them had dinners together , he was forever kissing her hand and attempting Rudolph Valentino flickers with his eyes . When they waited in line to see Lenny , he tried pawing her ; when they sat through The Wiz all he wanted to do was nibble at her shoulder . Lydia fought him off with skill and ardor , but not too much of the latter and he knew when Two-Brew invited him , early in January for drinks at his place and dinner at The Four Seasons after that before the evening was done , gold bands would be in evidence . He felt terrific about it and he felt even better about the novel . ( Page 380 now and counting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate being put into his father 's skull and the agonizing physical suffering before his body would properly obey him , was , Chub thought , probably a section in need of cutting , but maybe the best thing so far . Because none of the nurses gave the veteran much chance at coming all the way back , but the man knew the one great secret : He was special . ) The only thing Chub did n't feel so terrific about was there was little heat in his apartment . He wrote in sweaters and , on very bitter days , his overcoat . He was still cold when he got off the crosstown bus and walked to Kitchel 's . Two-Brew had a two-bedroom place a block from his office . It was a zoo , naturally , but a comfortable one . " My dear dear friend , " Two-Brew began , as Chub walked in . " My own Horatio . " He moved to embrace Chub but Chub gave him the slip , tossed his coat over Kitchel 's arms and instead embraced Lydia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . Two-Brew went to the kitchen , returned with a bottle . " A little champagne to start the festivities ? " " Only if it 's Manischewitz , " Lydia said . Chub smiled . There was no doubt they would hammer and tong each other blissfully for years . Two-Brew poured . " A toast : to our best man , Charles Fuller . " Chub was honored and said so . They touched glasses and as Lydia began to drink Kitchel said : " Hold  --  look at the way her arm moves , Chubbo . Note the grace . Behold her form : the perfect breadth of shoulder , the bosom jut , the waist a wasp would envy . " " Oh , can it , " Lydia said . " I liked him better mean , " Chub said.  | " I think I 'm beginning to agree with you , " she said . " Can it the both of you  --  ? I promise to be demeaning by dinner-time . " It was still before eight and they were n't due at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another bottle of champagne when the first one was empty . Chub begged off . The stuff tasted funny . Or at least he thought it did . He sat down suddenly and Lydia asked was he okay and he said yes , fine , because if there ever was an evening he did n't want to bitch up , this was it . He was just so goddamn cold , though . Lydia suggested a nap and Chub said thanks no , he did n't do that . But she insisted , promising to wake him in a half hour and a half hour later she did . He put some water on his face and went out to the living room where they were watching the tube . " Fix the set , " Chub said . They both looked at him . " The set , " Chub said , pointing . " It 's a double image . " Christ , he was freezing . They still looked at him . " There is n't any double image . The set is working perfectly . " Chub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never would have made it to the couch if Lydia had n't supported him there , and he did n't have a doctor but the Kitchel family did , and by the time Two-Brew had him on the line Lydia had taken his temperature , which was a hundred and three , and when Kitchel relayed that message to Dr. Stein along with the business of the double vision , the doctor suggested they meet at the emergency ward of the hospital he worked through and they did n't go to The Four Seasons that night , they went to Manhattan General instead , where Chub was to stay for a week . Or maybe it was n't a week , his time sense was wobbly . The one thing he was sure of was this : The doctors would n't leave himVI alone . They came by constantly , many of them young hotshots , and they all had the same routine , some early bullshit about how was his fever , the aches and the chills , and then , oh , yes , they began to ask about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Dr. Stein was elderly and austere and when Chub thanked him for all the attention he pooh-poohed it , explaining that ordinarily you could buzz for hours and no one would conk around , butp141when something unusual happened , all the interns and younger men got excited . After a few days his fever was down but the double vision was worse  --  he could see perfectly out of either eye singly , the two just would n't work together , and the night the two hotshots came in for the spinal tap Chub was confused , because Stein had n't mentioned it and his fever was normal and were they sure they had the right guy and they both said yes , the spinal tap was for Fuller , and Chub said he did n't want it , he really did n't , and that could n't they wait for Stein to come later and they said no , and please to lie on his side and Chub , frightened , did that , and they began trying to hook the needle into the base of his spine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , This is going to be material , you 'll write about this someday , it 's great material , it is , it is , ' but then the pain was too much and he was screaming , he could n't help it , he could n't , the pain was that bad and the young guys were having a bitch of a time finding the entry spot with the long needle but they persisted , the pain increasing and Chub wanted to pass out but he could n't , could n't do a thing but lie there embarrassed at the sounds he was making until he heard Stein in the room , and now Stein was the one screaming , vilifying the hotshots for doing an unauthorized procedure , and they said they thought he might want it and Stein said over and over , " I 'm putting this on your records , both of you , I wo n't forget this . " Chub did n't forget it either . The next day , an ancient neurologist came across a similar case in a text . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some reason attacked the nerves of an eye . He would be fine , but it would take a year for the nerve to heal itself , and he would have to wear an eye patch until then . The day after that , eye-patched and feverless , Chub went home . He was terribly weak and Kitchel said to come rest up with him , Lydia seconding , but Chub said no , thank you but no , he wanted to go back to his place . Lydia helped him up the stairs  --  the ninety-seven were too much for Two-Brew . So he waited below while Chub and Lydia made the ascent . Chub had to stop at each floor but they made it finally and he fell in bed . Lydia left , came back with bags of food . By the time she 'd put them all away , Chub was drifting . It was several clays before he felt strong enough to try a walk . He bundled up against the cold , slowly descended the stairs . The eye patch fdt funny , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grip the banister in surprise . He decided what he would do was walk the block and a half to Broadway for the Times and he rested a moment in the foyer of the securityless building . Chub never minded that  --  anyone who wanted to get him was going to have to be a practiced mountaineer and the odds against that were unlikely . He opened the door , moved onto the sidewalk , his body bent forward against the January cold -- and coming toward him  --  the first human he saw  --  was an old guy wearing an eye patch . As they passed , their good eyes moved toward each other , slowly , in wounded recognition . Fantastic , Chub thought . He had to put that in his Journal . They were like two old lizards considering each other on a summertime log . He made it to the newsstand , got his paper , made it back to his place . But the stairs depleted what resources he had left and by the time he flopped back in bed he 'd forgotten what the hell he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw Stein the good doctor examined him , told him all was coming along , asked what Chub was doing with himself . Chub answered , basically watching game shows in the morning , sleeping in the afternoons , watching the evening crap at night . Stein allowed that such activity was certainly good for his mind but it was n't doing much for his body , and if Chub wanted to get his strength back quickly , mild exercise would be beneficial ; walking would be fine , but not till the weather warmed , so he suggested swimming , cautioning Chub ( a ) not to overdo it and ( b ) to be sure to dry off thoroughly before returning home . Chub located a health club not far from his place that was open from two till ten and that accepted monthly memberships , so the next day he was there promptly at two , paid for the ensuing weeks . The pool was big , the staff small . A fat lady working the desk , a college kid playing at lifeguard , an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chub changed , went down to the empty pool . He had n't been near one since the visit to Gretchen  --  was Serendipity still moldering at the bottom ? No . Ridiculous . Probably Gretchen had taken it out once he 'd gone , taken it out with great r care and toweled the pages drY , , malcin sure it was a book again . No . More than likely she 'd gone around and bought a dry copy . It was in a lot of stores , she would n't have any trouble finding it.  |p143Probably  it was in her room , by her bedside table , maybe , or across the room where she could see the cover before she slept . Chub slipped into the shallow end . The water was very warm and felt healing . He 'd been a good swimmer ever since he had first learned ; now he pushed off , doing a slow , well-formed crawl . And was astonished to find he could barely cover the twenty yards to the other end . He rested in the deep water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath back . Then he pushed off , only got halfway . The next day he was the only one in the pool again when he arrived and he hesitated a long time before giving it a shot . This time he made the first length without terrible fatigue and did n't pause , almost making it back to where he 'd started before his strength gave out . The third day the fat lady was in her spot at the desk and the kid lifeguard was reading Playboy but Torn was late . Chub undressed , went down to the water . There was someone already in the pool , a women doing a breaststroke , her black hair piled high . She wore dark sunglasses , which is what first made Chub study her . She was probably mid-sixties , and her head did n't bob much as she swam . Chub thought , as he watched , that he knew her from someplace , Athens maybe , maybe Oberlin . Then he realized he did n't know her , she just looked familiar . She looked like Hedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swam up and back , the entire forty yards without stopping . Pleased , he decided to make it all the way to a hundred before he left for the day . But he was breathing heavily , so he got out of the pool and rested in the chair , his eyes half closed . When the woman who looked like Hedy Lamarr was done , Chub watched her leave . She was thin and tan , but her skin was wrinkled with age . He waited a little longer , tried another forty , almost made it . Then he rested again , did a final twenty without as much effort as he feared . He grabbed his towel , went to the men 's locker room and before he was inside , Tom was on him : " Didja see her ?  --  the one day the flicking subway 's late and I miss her  --  Hedy Lamarr was here , shit . " Chub went to his locker , took off his wet suit , started for the shower . Torn , almost in a frenzy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . She swam on her back and she did n't have a top on . Greatest little tits in all the world and I missed her . " Chub looked at the old guy . Tom must have been close top144seventy . He was in good shape for his age but the way he was going on now could n't have been good for a young man 's heart . " Easy , " Chub told him . " Maybe she 'll come back tomorrow . " He showered and when he was done Tom was standing outside the stall . " Goddamn right she 'll come back tomorrow  --  hell , who goes to a place only once ? This is a good place , you like it , do n't you ? " " Excellent , " Chub said , moving past him to where the hair dryer hung on a hook . " I keep it clean , do n't I ? Goddamn right . You know what I 'm gon na do ? " Chub turned on the hair dryer , shook his head . Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine . " I 'm gon na swat her right on the ass  --  friendly like , nothing crude . Them movie stars , they like a gentleman , everyone 's all the time after them . And then , once we 've struck up a good conversation , I 'm  --  " He shook his head now . " I can see her tits in that water . The best . Do you think I should tell her that ? " Over the dryer Chub said , " Well , probably you 'll have to see how the conversation 's going . " " Right . I 'll get her talking good and once that 's over , I 'll take her out to dinner , someplace not too fancy  --  them movie stars , they get sick of always going someplace fancy , " and when Chub 's hair was dry Tom followed him to his locker , talking about Hedy Lamarr and while Chub dressed , Tom talked on , but Chub was hurrying now , anxious to get home , because the impulse was on him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled some paper into his machine and began to fiddle.  - -  great story idea --  -- the last little while spent talking about where this attendant should take Hedy Lamarr for dinner. suggested Yorkville , she 's German , he went bananas. what if she comes back tomorrow and it turns out she is n't Hedy Lamarr -- p145no , no , what if she is -- and he asks her out andand she wo n't give him the time of day -- no , nomaybe she says yes andand what ? HE STILL THINKS SHE 'S TWENTY . Chub stopped , stared at the scratch paper awhile. so ? so what if he still thinks she 's twenty ? well ? well . He got up , went into the bedroom , lay down , turned on the television . The soaps were on . Chub flicked from station to station . Boring , boring , boring . The next thing he knew it was an hour later . He must have napped . Whipped from the swimming . He got up , went to his desk again , read what he 'd written. odd. looks like sludge. boring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pitched it into his wastebasket  --  two points  --  lay down again . It was n't a great story idea . Besides , Updike did it better in " The Persistence of Desire . " And besides besides , what the hell was he doing messing with a short story when he had a novel working ? The problem was energy . Energy and concentration . He was n't strong enough yet . But if he could n't sit clown and whip off pages , at least he could research , and Chub did . He found a lot of articles on the whys of people starting boozing and two books were helpful and he got a doctor on the phone who specialized in the problem and they talked fir fifteen minutes.  |p146But  best of all was the COA . There were maybe a dozen sitting around the table when Chub slipped in and sat quietly down ; all were children of alcoholics and the sense of shared pasts , shared griefs , was unmistakable . They were of varying ages , some of them drank coffee out of containers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one with an eye patch but he 'd gotten not to mind it anymore . As he glanced out at the early February sun , he realized the eye patch gave him a glamour he 'd never possessed before . He had panache now , like Burt Lancaster in The Crimson Pirate , one of his all-time favorite flicks . He took out a pen and paper ; he had no intention of talking , just wanted to take notes . At three precisely the leader said , " My name is Ross and I 'm the son of an alcoholic . " He was a fine-looking mustachioed man , twinklingeyed , and he gestured toward the person to his left , and they went around the table : " Frank . " " Ruth . " " Judy . " " Ilene . " " Ed . " " Pete . " " Chub . " " Bill . " " Dave . " " Stevie . " A girl raised her hand then and the leader nodded toward her . " My name is Ilene and this is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She was going very rapidly . " All the time you want , " the leader said. "  --  well , my mother was an alcoholic and it was  --  what I wonderedI guess was this : Nobody knew that she drank , it was all kept inside the family and is that unusual or not ? " Half the people at the table burst out laughing . " I think you can tell from the response , " the leader said , " what the answer is . It 's like there 's an elephant sitting in the corner of the living room but nobody will acknowledge that it 's there . " " Elephant in the living room , " Chub scribbled down . Christ , what a phrase . Maybe it was good enough for a chapter title . Damn right it was.  |p147The  next two hours zipped . The only problem was he had n't brought enough paper along , there was that much wonderful stuff . Even better , though , was when the meeting broke at five . It had taken place in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back against the wall . Chub helped him . " The eye patch is new , " the leader said . Chub did n't get it . " Are n't you the author of Under the Weather ? I took the hardcoverout of the library . Your picture was on the back . " Chub nodded . ( Two-Brew had insisted on taking the photo and Chub thought he was barely recognizable but Two-Brew , claiming he could be Kirsh of Ottawa if he so desired , blasted him by saying the only people more ego-drenched than actors and politicians were feebleminded authors . ) " You 're a wonderful writer , " the leader said then . " I read it through twice . " They parted outside and when Chub was alone he looked at his notes , then executed a dazzling thrust and parry  --  Burt Lancaster threw down his sword and begged for mercy . The leader this time was an older woman , very thin ; her name was Ruth and both her parents were alcoholics . She gestured around the table . Chub sat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; no note paper this time . His stomach was tight , tight with anger at himself for coming , for wasting two precious hours . " Ilene . " " Bill . " " Donna . " " Mike . " " Debby . " Pause . Finally the leader said , with a smile , " If you would n't mind . " " Sorry , " Chub said . " Was n't thinking . No . I mean I was thinking , I just was n't thinking about here . Chub . " " Jenny. , , " Brett . " " Susanna . " " Clarence . " Then a woman raised a hand and spoke about the had week shep148was having , she 'd just broken up with her boyfriend and she got all choked up until the leader said the important thing was that she 'd be fine , she was here , one day at a time was what you had to remember and then another woman raised her hand and she 'd had a bad week , too , she 'd lost her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't sure and could she hold out . Chub , listening a little , realized that this Children of Alcoholics meeting was different  --  most of those present were alcoholics themselves . Recovering alcoholics . Trying to stay that way . Chub glanced at his watch . Half past two . Ninety minutes to go . Could he last it ? He did n't have to stay , he knew it was an asshole move before he got there . But it would be rude , just taking off now . He could trip off for ninety minutes . He had no intention of speaking , so he could wander wherever his mind wanted . At five of four he was stunned to see his right hand rise . " Yes ? " the leader said . " I have n't had a bad week or anything , so I guess I should n't be going on like this  --  I 'm not going on actually , am I ?  --  I mean , I 've just started . " " We have time , " the leader said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I guess I just had this question is all . Actually , it 's not a question . " He paused . " Then again , maybe it is . " " Please , " the leader said . " Do n't feel pressured . " " I do n't . " " You do n't have to . " Chub nodded . Everyone was watching him . " Okay , I 'm writing this novel about my father  --  he did n't hit the bottle bad till after the war and I 'm having a little trouble easing into that part  --  no big deal , but I wish it was going a little quicker is all and I wondered if anyone else ever had kind of the same trouble and how they got through it . " " How long have you been having trouble ? " the leader asked . Chub shrugged . " Maybe since the pneumonia . " " I 'm sorry , the what ? " " I had this weird pneumonia two years ago and since around then it 's been slow going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " the leader asked . Chub smiled . " No , nothing like that ; I mean I 've started a couplep149other novels and they 're cooking and just last week I went over a story of mine  --  it 's a nutty idea about how this astronomer discoversHeaven behind Pluto  --  Pluto or Mars , one or the other , it does n't matter  --  the kicker is another astronomer discovers it is n't Heaven out there , it 's Hell . It was always too cute before but now I 've got it right . " " Is this your first writing ? " the leader asked . " Oh , hell no , I had a book of stories published four years back , it was called  --  " Stop , he told himself . If you tell them the title they 'll know who you are . They might . One of them might . One hundred thousand copies . " The reason I asked , " the leader said , " was that I wondered what suggestions your editor has given you . " Chub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want my book to be a surprise to him  --  I just want to drop the whole goddamn thing on his desk some morning out of the blue and watch his face . " " You have n't told him then . " " Right . " " Why do n't you talk it out with him ? I do n't think keeping secrets does anyone much good . " Chub could n't believe it . " Secrets ? Who the hell said anything about secrets ? It 's a surprise , I told you , ca n't you flicking tell the difference between a secret and a surprise ? " They were all staring at him now , and Chub said , " I 'm sorry , I really am , " and then he stood and took off out the door , grabbing the first subway for Queens , where he picked up his taxi . He 'd been driving a cab most nights for the past twenty months now , ever since his money had run out ; Gretchen had died about that time and he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inheritance because they knew how big his advance had been and had to be wondering what he was living on now . Driving a cab was n't bad , it kept the days free for work and as he pulled out of his garage he got a ride from three blue-haired ladies who wanted to go into Manhattan to see Streisandin A Star Is Born . They tried to be friendly but he was n't in the mood  --  traffic was murder coming over the bridge and more than that , how could he have shot off his mouth back in the church ? Well , really he had n't , and if anyone recognized him , he 'd just say it was gathering material , material for his book.  |p150He  dropped the ladies behind Bloomingdale 's and they stiffed him on the tip but you had to expect that when you picked up women with blue hair . Traffic was a bitch all over  --  it was Friday night  --  and he almost got into a fight with some jerk from Jersey who tried pulling a right from the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were heading for Annie , a bigger hit now than even Chorus Line , and at Fifty-second he told them they 'd get there faster if he did n't have to turn in but could just let them off on Eighth , but they did n't trust him , they thought he was pulling something , so they said no , no we want the theatre and Chub cursing to himself turned into Fifty-second . Gridlock . After five minutes they said maybe it would be quicker so they got out , leaving him trapped for twenty minutes on Fifty-second Street , which did n't do a lot for his mood . Maybe because of his mood he picked up the three black guys . Badly dressed , drunk , and they wanted Harlem , a side street off Lenox and a lot of drivers carried baseball bats when they worked nights and Chub wished , as he drove uptown , that he had something to protect himself except it turned out he did n't need anything  --  theypaid when they got to the building they wanted and they tipped him plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meeting when he stopped at eleven in front of the Waldorf , where a bunch of couples were waiting in line for cabs . The first couple got in  --  a young guy , swinger type , with a girl he knew he was going to score with , you could tell that before the door was even closed and Chub was about to pull off when he heard his name called -- and Paige Kitchel , standing with some guy , was knocking at his closed front window . " Hey , Paige , great , " Chub said , rolling down the window , throwingon a smile . " Just be a sec , " he told the swinger in the back . " Old friend . " Paige Kitchel of course was no friend . Her name was n't Paige Kitchel anymore  --  she 'd gotten married awhile back , then gotten divorced . But " old " was valid . The last job she 'd had done on her face had been too tight ; she was thirty , looked forty , and all resemblance to Natalie Wood was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , this , " Chub laughed . " Just gathering material . My titherp151drove a cab awhile after the war , so I wanted to be able to feel it before I wrote about it . " " Um-hmm , " Paige said . Chub raced on . " ' Course , that was in Chicago and this is New York but what the hell , I figured the job 's the same no matter where . " " Um-hmm , " Paige said again . " Can we get a move on ? " the swinger in the back said . " Yes , sir , " Chub said . He looked at Paige . " Got ta scoot . " She laughed a little . Chub started to reach for her then , reach for her and say , " Please do n't tell Two-Brew , " but there was no point . She had n't believed a thing he 'd told her and even if he begged , there was no way she was n't going to call her brother with the glorious news . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day when he heard the answer . Slow sounds on the stairs . Crutch sounds . He went to the door , opened it slightly . He could hear the exertion as Kitchel mounted the ninety-seven stairs . Probably his crutches were digging hard into the soft area under his arms . It seemed that every half floor there was a pause . Chub started to call out , decided against it , decided to leave his door ajar and he did , heading for his desk , slipping a piece of scratch paper into the roller , pausing , taking it out , pitching it toward the wastebasket . Perfect . " The buzzer did n't work , " Two-Brew said , pale and exhausted , leaning in the doorway . " Never does . " " But the door was unlocked . " " Always is . Want some coffee ? " " I did n't come for coffee . Paige called me last night . " " Was that a fantastic coincidence ? My third time driving a cab and I run into someone I know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . Many times over . " Chub shrugged . " Gathering material is all , like I told her . " " What is my genius doing ? " " See , my father drove a cab and I figured  --  " " Can it ! My secretary 's spent the morning on the phone with the Taxi and Limousine Commission . You 've been gathering material ' for over a year and a half . "  | " I got ta eat , right ? " " And the money from your mother ? " " Did n't last . " " Was there any ? " " Not as much as I thought . " Two-Brew came inside , closed the door . " Are you lying ? " " If it makes you happy to think so . " " It does n't make me happy . Chub , what the hell have you been doing ? " " What the hell do you think  --  writing my ass off " " Last month at dinner you told us you were eight hundred pages plus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the best thing you 've ever done . Could I see it ? " Chub shook his head . " Not till it 's reworked and smooth . " Two-Brew held out his hand . " I wo n't read it . I promise . Just let me hold it . " Finally , Chub said , " I 'm not quite there . That was kind of a fib . What I should have said was it 's going to be the best thing I 've ever done . " " Let me see the book . " " No . I 've never let you see anything till it was done and I 'm not going to change things now , not the great way we 've been going . " Two-Brew sat heavily by the desk . " Enough with the games . I 'm not leaving until you show me what you 've done and we both know that so give me the goddamn thing . " " Not in the mood you 're in . " Two-Brew shook his head . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're going to show it to me . " Chub got up suddenly , went to the bathroom to put some water on his face . " It 's in the top drawer , you arrogant son of a bitch . " When he came back , Two-Brew was holding The Dead Pile . " Three hundred eighty-two pages is very impressive , " Kitchel said . " It seems to me that 's where you were on the night of my engagement . What the fuck 's been going on ? " " I 've been writing  --  writing , just like I said  --  I put it aside is all  --  I 've got two other novels and they 're cooking like crazy . " " What are they ? " " They 're not done or anything , but they 're terrific . One 's about this guy who writes obituaries  --  I read about a guy who does obits for the Times and he goes around and visits people who are old andp153sick , just getting the record straight , and he goes to Chicago to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ andhere 's the kicker  --  see , the financier 's family has just poisoned him before he changed his will and they ca n't risk being discovered . " " And the other ? " " It 's even better , Two-Brew  --  I swear  --  see , it 's about this actor who ca n't cut it in New York and he finally decides to leave , there 's this shitty deli owner who 's always been a prick to him , so just as a gesture  --  like a symbolic farewell to the city  --  he breaks the glass front of the store and steals some stuff , nothing valuable , he 's not in it for gain , it 's like I said a symbol and he gets home to his crummy cold-water flat and  --  and here 's the kicker  --  he loves it . So he begins doing other robberies , only what makes it great is he uses all his actor 's skill , voice changes , makeup , and he begins getting written about in the papers  --  he 's a star . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ louder . " Right here , bastard , right here , " and he shoved two folders over . " I 've got thirty pages on the one and almost forty on the other . " " May I read them ? " " I do n't care what you do , " Chub said , and he went into the bedroom and lay down and tried to watch the tube while TwoBrewread in the next room , only his stomach was had , worse than at the COA meeting , so he closed his eyes and wondered which of them Kitchel would like the most , because they were good , not perfect maybe , but he 'd slave at them until he got them right . From the next room , Two-Brew said , " I 'm done . " Chub looked at his watch . Not an hour had gone by . " I do n't like you speed-reading my stuff " " I did n't . They 're very skillful . " " Goddamn right . " " Skillful and slick and shitty and there 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's not true . " " I did n't like saying it . " " Oh , sure you did  --  you like pissing on people , it makes you feel so goddamn smart  --  " And then Two-Brew was standing : " Christ , Chub , it 's me , what 's happened ? "  |p154And  Chub never knew what , the look on Kitchel 's face , the sadness in his tone , but suddenly he knew he had to let it out , let it all pour out , and he said , " I  --  " do n't know , he almost finished . " I  --  " just know that it 's bad , he almost said . " I  --  " need to talk , I really do , I need so goddamn much , and you can help me , so he reached out his hands to Kitchel , stretched them as far as they 'd go . Two-Brew began shouting at him then  --  backing away and shouting : " Listen to you  --  I  --  I  --  I  --  '  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Look at you  --  whining about yourself . What about me ? I brought you here ! It was your goddamn dream and I made it happen ! I got you published ! I did all that and you betray me ! "  --  I did n't  --  I swear  --  " "  --  lies  --  for two years , lies  --  " "  --  I did n't betray you , I only wanted it to be a surprise , I swear  --  " "  --  you succeeded  --  betrayal always comes as a surprise  --  " "  --  do n't say any more  --  please  --  "  --  you have my word on that  --  " He worked his way to the door , threw it open , whirled . " I trusted you and in my world , there is no sin worse than betraying a friend and I promise it will be a long time before we ever speak again . " And it was . And it was . Chub was done with his first bottle of Wild Turkey by suppertimeand that got him through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night and probably it was the day after that when he was drinking his breakfast that the phone rang and it was Andrew Cheyney calling from Oberlin , asking a favor , because he was late on his book of Katka papers and would Chub possibly consider taking over his writing class this semester , just this one semester , the money was n't all that much and he did n't want to interrupt Chub 's novel but Chub had done so well writing at Oberlin before that perhaps he could thrive again and Chub realized , even drunk in the morning , that a life preserver was being pitched his way , because it had gone well at Oberlin and it could n't go worse than here so he managed to interrupt and say , " Yes , " and " Yes , " and " Yes , I 'll come right away , " and he did , locking up his apartment , packing what clothes he had , heading back , back to where it had all begun so beautifully , with perfect B. J. Peacock coming down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon back , Chub was pleasantly stunned to find himself sharing his bed again with Patty McLean . Professor Cheyney had picked him up at the Cleveland Airport , driven him to the college . First Cheyney took him to a large room on the top floor of Westervelt Hall and asked if this would do for an office . It was bright , with a desk and typewriter in one corner , a large round table in the center where the writing class would be held . Cheyney was solicitous ; was this satisfactory ? Chub said more than . Next Cheyney took him to a lovely suite of rooms he 'd engaged tentatively for the semester . It was the ground floor of a large house on the north side of town , on a quiet street , just two houses away from the home that Cheyney shared with Durning , the librarian . Were the rooms all right ? Chub said palatial . Cheyney , still the small dynamo he 'd been when Chub first asked admittance into his class , left him then , adding that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still remembered Chub 's years in the library and referred to him fondly as the first freshman who knew of the existence of Sheehy . Alone , Chub unpacked , went out to the front porch and stood in the February wind and contemplated renting a bicycle . Everyone at Oberlin used them , and Chub had , too , until Kitchel entered his life , but that was then . And while he was on the porch , a familiar-looking figure pedaled by , saw him , shouted , " Chub , " wheeled her way to the steps and then ran up into his arms . Chub held her , embarrassed almost because they had been intimate for over a year and so much of her was gone from his memory . He told her what he was doing there and she explained that she was almost finished with her disserta/tion in psych at Ohio State and that she worked as a shrink here in town for the many college students that needed gentling . He showed her his rooms and she looked at her watch and then her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a woman , could n't imagine that he ever would , what if he 'd misread things , who needed that ? When they were in bed he decided he had n't misread things . The first time he kissed her breasts she almost giggled and he remembered that that was one of Patty 's ways , her breasts were ticklish , so he concentrated on the rest of her and it was a splendid homecoming . Chub caressed her tenderly , running his hands through her curly brown hair , touching his fingertips to her skin , and when she laughed he said , " Sorry , " because he figured he was coming too close to her breasts again . " It was n't you , I was remembering something , my speed-writing book . I taught myself speed-writing the summer after our freshman year and I was home in Columbus and my father 's boss needed a temporary secretary for a week while his regular girl went on holiday . I campaigned for the job  --  I could type and answer the phone and with speed-writing under my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up for me . " His boss was this terrifying authority figure  --  I was scared to death of old Mr. Kron , but when I went to work the first day I hid all that and did great and after lunch he asked me in for dictation and I got up all bright and shiny with my yellow Ticonderoga and pad and I sat across the desk and he said was I ready and I nodded and he started , you know , name , address , all that stuff , and he was n't half a paragraph past the salutation when I realized  --  I could n't do it . I 'd never taken a letter before , I 'd only practiced from the book and I thought should I interrupt him but I did n't have the guts , so I figured after he was done with the letter I 'd go out and try and reconstruct it from memory . Only he did n't stop with one . He dictated nineteen letters , it took an hour and then some and I just sat there nodding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kill myself . Finally he said that that would be all so I thanked him and went outside and kept right on walking . Never went back . I cried for more than a week after , thinking my father was sure to be fired , but he was n't and I lived . " She kissed Chub on the mouth ,  |p159then  lay back . " Second biggest error of my life . " There was a pause before she said , " Even you have to be interested in what the biggest was . " " I am , I definitely am , " Chub said , wondering what the " evenyou " part meant . He liked the anecdote ; it was sweet material . " Never telling you straight out how I felt , " Patty said then . " Felt about what ? " " Same old Chub you , jerk . I just adored you so . " Chub looked at her . " We were comfortable was all . " " That 's what you thought . If you thought . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our time together . You were n't even sure who I was on the bicycle outside . " " Wrong and wrong . I knew who you were the second I saw you and I remember every date we had , damn near . " " Do n't look now , but a lightning bolt is headed in your direction . " He started to sit . She held him , brought him back down . " And the reason it was the greatest error was not because I thought you 'd swoon and propose  --  but because I cared for you so and you were in such trouble and I knew it and I never faced you with it . It would have been good if someone had . You seem so open and look so kind and you 're the bestest good boy in all the world  --  that , I suspect is your ambition , anyway  --  and you never talk to anybody about anything . " " Sure I do . " " Not in this life . " This time Chub did sit on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're this genius shrink and everything and I 'm proud of you , but save it for your patients , all right ? " Patty sat on the other side of the bed . " Okay . But at least I said it now . " She began to dress . " How bad are things ? " " Why do you even ask a question like that ? " " Because it 's so obvious  --  why the hell else would you be back here ? " " Because I 've always wanted to teach , you know that , and the timing was perfect . " " Here comes another lightning bolt . " " I 'm sorry if it pains you to be wrong with your analysis , but things arc going great with me . " " I 'm glad I 'm wrong . " She hooked her bra , smiled at him . " Danp160and I would love to have you for dinner while you 're here . Dan .. . pause for effect ... is my husband . For three years . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes flicked toward the rumpled sheets . " Things are going great for us too , " Patty said . " I ca n't make you writers , " Chub began , looking around at the undergraduates , young people sitting around the large table in his office . " I do n't think anyone can make you writers . All I can do is make you write . " Heads nodded . They were watching him with such intensity and it was difficult for him , because he knew he was their ambition . " When I was in high school I heard an old expression : Want to be a writer ?  --  write a million words . ' Since we only have these few weeks together you will be pleased to learn , I suspect , that you will not reach that goal this semester . " Light laughter now , along with the intensity . " I 've cleared all this with Professor Cheyney and here 's the drill : You will write one page a day . Seven pages a week . And I 'll meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've done . Class time will be spent in discussing the work of major storytellers . Any questions so far ? " A thin girl raised her hand . " I heard that when Professor Cheyney taught this he read our work out loud . " " I 've heard that too , " Chub said . " But this semester we will discuss the masters in public and your own work in private . I hope that 's satisfactory . " It was . " One last important note of business : There will be no grades  --  this is purely a pass/fail course . All you have to do is meet the writing requirement and you survive . I want the pressure off you , 1 want you to feel free to doodle or experiment or tell me the secrets of your heart . There is no way that I can see  --  since this is a course you all elected to take  --  that any of you can not pass . I hope that 's satisfactory too . " It definitely was . " Okay  --  I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can discuss them here  --  I hope none of you are passionate about Melville'sshorter efforts and I also  --  " " Late ! " boomed from the doorway.  |p161Chub  looked around toward the giant figure moving into the room . Six three , six four , probably two hundred solid pounds at least . " You 're all late since I am always early . " He sat across from Chub . " Now that I 'm here , we may commence . " " Cool it , Hungerford , " one of the boys said . Chub , watching as Hungerford gave the guy the finger , knew he was in the presence of someone trying very hard to be a road company Kitchel . " I 'm Peter Hungerford , " the giant said , looking at Chub . " Who the hell are you ? " Chub almost smiled , picked up his train of thought . " Who would you like to discuss in class ? " he said . " Who do you admire ? " Hungerford 's hand shot up . " There 's one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just think it 's the best book of the decade , I think it 's the greatest work of the century . And the name of the masterpiece isUnder the Weather . " Chub sighed . " Hungerford  --  you missed the beginning but this is a course you ca n't fail so there 's no need for brown-nosing . " " Ah , well , then , let me make one slight amendment to what I 've said . I thought Under the Weather sucked , and not only that , I did n't read it . " Chub broke out laughing ; at least life would n't be dull . The letter from Kitchel contained no salutation : Please read this through . My behavior was unconscionable and I do not ask forgiveness . I just want to try and explain . Chub , do you remember when I first sought you out in the library freshman year ? Because you knew the bartender at the No-Name ? That was true  --  you did know him  --  but it was at the same time false  --  I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want your contacts , I wanted you . I 'd watched you those first weeks and the way people responded . People like you , you see ; probably you do n't even know that or want to know that but it was and is gospel . I grew up as this embarrassment  --  do you know why my first name is what it is ? Because my father admired a great fighterp162named Stanley Ketchel . He already had a daughter and now he wanted a son , with all the manliness implied . Well , after my glorious bout with polio , that was out and I was left to live through his disappointment . Once I realized , once grammar school started and I realized I was a thing to be avoided , I decided to attack , to make all the little shits avoid me . And I was immaculately successful . Then , in the Cheyney class when I realized that you were not just someone I coveted but someone with your gift , you became a gift to me . If you had n't come to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to you . The fact that you survived your childhood and still had strength  --  I needed to be near that fire . I 'm twenty-seven years old and you 're the first friend I 've ever had , not counting Lydia and that was in no small part your doing . So why did I behave as I did in your apartment ? Because , you see , I need you . I need to have you to rely on . And when you began to come apart before me  --  when you reached out to me with your needs , it was more pressure than I could bear . You were n't supposed to need anybody . I was the only one allowed that . I 've been writing this letter for ten days , over and over , and the only reason I 'm sending it now is because I realize I 'll never get it right . Christ , you did n't betray anybody , I did it all . When I think of the anguish you must have gone through these last two years  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not even to me -- I simply could not face it . I did not have the strength to be your rock . That was n't our deal  --  you were supposed to be mine . Except , of course , you never knew we had a deal . After I left your apartment , I told Lydia what I 'd done and like the great good wife she is , she listened with perfect attention . Then she said that , knowing you as she does , she was sure you would eventually forgive me . Then she added she was n't so sure that she would.  |p163She  has . One down and one to go . Do n't answer this . But when you get back to the city if you give me a buzz , I promise my secretary wo n't put you on hold . One final note : In case it has escaped your woefully underdevelopedmind , this was sort of kind of meant to be an apology . K.Chub did n't answer the letter , but the week after it came , he was having coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sitting alone , reading some literature about the college . Obviously , a prospective freshman . A professor of history with a very fat wife stopped briefly by the girl and asked if her last name was Henderson . She nodded . The professor said four words : " I knew your mother . " And then the girl was alone again . As Chub eavesdropped , he felt such weight in those words and he knew , or imagined he knew , that the professor had not just known the girl 's mother but had loved her too . And as he watched the professor 's wife waddle toward the exit door , he paid and went to his office and wrote a little sketch , called it " I Knew Your Mother . " The next day , between meetings with students , he remembered Patty 's dictation anecdote so he wrote that , too , six pages , mainly dealing with the mind of the terrified girl as she catalogued possibleways to end her life , beginning small and building to a public execution with the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guillotine . If it was anything , it was hopefully sweet , no more , but he wrote and rewrote it several times , the same with the professor and his lost love , and sent them off to Kitchel . They were n't much , but at least they were his , and Two-Brew would know that things were the way they had been between them . Kitchel 's answer came in a few days , a solid page single-spaced , and it began with this : " I 'm not sure if these are the best things you 've ever done , but I 'm not sure they 're not . There 's a maturity here  --  you 've always understood sadness but I do n't think this deeply ( speaking of the prof and the young girl ) . And the dictation piece is just a wonder  --  1 roared when I read it and I do n't do that a lot , trust ow , and ... "  |p164And  Chub , stunned , read the words , the well-intended lies , but halfway through the page he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking only this : Jesus God , I 've slipped back that far . That very night he decided to seek out Dr. Wallinsky . Except he was n't at the No-Name and the bartender did n't have much clue as to whom Chub was talking about . But Chub kept asking until somebody told him Wallinsky had moved away and somebody else said no , he had n't moved , he 'd died . Chub went to the wall phone in the back and picked up the directory beneath it and there was the name , Felix Wallinsky , on Prospect , and Chub thought about calling , decided the walk would do him good , and when he reached the right number he rang the bell and an old woman opened the door . Chub asked if Dr. Wallinskywas in . " What'cha want him for ? " Chub explained that they 'd known each other in his student days . " Third floor on the right , " she said . " Just follow your nose . " Chub understood what she meant as soon as he reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odor , growing stronger as he approached and knocked softly . " It 's Charles Fuller , " Chub said . There seemed to be a sound from inside so Chub turned the knob ; the door was unlocked . He stepped in . Whether the smell was one of liquor or decay or a mixture of both Chub was never sure . But clearly , the old man on the bed , stomach swollen like a woman soon to birth , was dying . The wall light was on , the bulb weak , but Chub could see the yellow skin . The room  --  with one exception  --  was in chaos . But the exceptionwas so strong Chub went to it . A glass case , with a dozen or so books inside , all preserved in clear plastic covers . Language as an Act of Faith by Felix Wallinsky . Published by Yale University Press . There was one copy of the American edition , one of the English , and the rest were translations into other languages . Chub carefully opened the case , took out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He put the book back , brought a chair to the bed , sat down . " I just was walking by , sir , and I thought I might pay my respects . I worked at the No-Name one summer . " Dr. Wallinsky moved his eyes toward Chub , breathed . " Charles Fuller ? People called me ' ( : hub ' ? "  |p165The  eyes were very dim . " There was a beer-drinking contest when I was a freshman . I was kind of helping . You were there . " Now a flicker : " . . . the best night ... " " It sure was , yessir . I 'm back here teaching this semester and I wondered how things were going with you . " " ... two ... Chub nodded . " That is right , Kitchel quit after two . " Dr. Wallinsky closed his eyes for a time then , concentrating very hard on breathing . Chub sat with him . After a while , Dr. Wallinsky said , " ... two ... " again . Chub waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Chub turned out the wall light , found his way back to the chair and started to talk , first about Dr. Wallinsky 's book and then about Roth , the Call It Sleep guy , and Harper Lee with her evocative To Kill a Mockingbird , and there was nothing wrong with being a onebookwonder , it was really kind of a distinguished tribe , after all , how many people could say even once they 'd given pleasure and Chub had done that , he had the letters from college kids safe back in his apartment in a box somewhere . And in a way he was lucky that the pneumonia had sideswiped him , had taken his energy and impulse away , because if it had n't , everybody would have known what he knew , that he was just a kid on a lucky streak , a fluke and a fraud , and that Two-Brew was the talent , the real talent , Two-Brew was the one who 'd seen how to make a book out of the stories and so , Chub ended up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do was count his blessings. " ... best night ... " Dr. Wallinsky said . Chub agreed , turned the light back on , said good-bye and walked back to his place . He felt , no question , really good about the evening . It was nice to see Wallinsky again but more than that , he had made Patty McLean out to be wrong in what she had said about him : When he really needed to talk to someone , he could do it easily . It was n't a problem at all . If he had a problem it was just getting through the rest of the semester. tic had hoped his return would help him breathe again , renew stirrings . But he was just an outsider , not really accepted byp166the students or the faculty  --  too old for one , too young for the other . Patty dropped by his house the second week of his stay and it was clear what was on her mind , but she was married and " bestest good boys "  --  her phrase for him  --  did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , twice a week , skillfully , but there was n't much mirth in the room . Chub became obsessed with his students . Or he tried very hard , but they were an odd group , sombre , well grounded in the basics , but none possessed flights of fancy . Any number of stories by the boys in his class began with sentences like " After it was over , he rolled up on one elbow and looked at her . " The girls tended to write New Yorke  --  type stuff  --  the kind of story where a couple would have a walk in Venice and then sip a citron presse and not talk and then an insect would crawl across the table and the girl would " understand . " Hungerford wrote about nothing at all . He was obviously a goofoff , in college undoubtedly because of parental pressure . His pages always had incredibly wide margins and they were obviously slapdashfragments , one about butterflies and were n't they pretty  --  that was his best effort . Chub 's hourly meetings with Hungerford rarely took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept calling Chub " pal " and looking at his watch . At last , in typical Oberlin weather  --  steady rain  --  May marched in . School was over before the final week and Chub was packed a week before school was over . He 'd made it . Or almost . Because Hungerfordhad the flu with two weeks to go and handed in nothing and the next week he had " these vicious allergies " and could n't begin to think and Chub , with the last days coming up fast , dropped a note in his mailbox saying that twenty-one pages were needed by that Friday or Hungerford would have a lot to answer for . On the stated morning , Chub arrived in his office for his last day and shoved in the box outside was a twenty-five-page wide-marginedbeautifully typed piece of work entitled " Saturday 's Child . " Gratefully , Chub sat down and began to read . The hero of the story , Chris , was a football hero at Oberlin who had run for eighty yards and a touchdown his sophomore year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris 's girl friend , l.ou , slept with him for the first time that night . She was rich but he was the golden boy until an injury to his knee in practice junior yearp167ended his athletic career but he was still the golden boy . They married after graduation and Chris went to work for Lou 's father 's business , but things did n't go well . Halfway through the story , Chub began to feel sick . Chris and Lou 's marriage held , but as his life began to slip away , hers built . She became a decorator and a successful one and then there were other men after her but she remained faithful . Then , fifteen years after graduation , Chris , a two-bit salesman now , happened to be back at Oberlin and he wandered alone on a spring day to the empty football field and before he knew it , his memories had him , and he stood on the twenty-yard line as an imaginary football came into his arms and then he repeated his magical run , eighty yards alone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only after he had done the act that he noticed a couple of undergraduatesin the stands , staring at him . " Once I played here , " Chris managed to say , and then , sweating , finished forever , he walked away . Alone in his office , Chub wanted to walk away . His plane would leave the next day but his instinct was to change that , just get the hell to Cleveland Airport and stand by for the next plane to New York . He sat back at his desk and studied the story again . It was by far the best writing Hungerford had ever tried ; there were stylish phrases reminiscent of Irwin Shaw . But then , that should n't have been surprising . Because what Chub was reading had been written by Irwin Shaw : " The Eighty-Yard Run . " Hungerford had handed in a piece of plagiarism . If you subscribed to Murphy 's Law , as Chub had come to , if you truly believed that everything that could go wrong would , it did n't make much for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braced you against disaster . Chub was not braced for this . He pushed the story away , rested his head in his hands , trying , trying desperately , to think . The whole reason he had handled the grades of the course the way he had was so that he would never have to fail anybody . But if you 're a soldier , the worst sin is cowardice , and if you believe in the printed word , plagiarism takes precedence . Chub sat without moving , trying to figure what would be best , what action , but then in his mind he saw a mirror and he wasp168remembering a terrible murderer in Chicago who used to scrawl " Stop me before I kill more " on the mirrors of his victims . Chub realized then that it was n't just plagiarism , it was worse than plagiarism , it was a cry for help . Hungerford wanted to get caught . He must have wanted to get caught . If you were going to copy something , well , Chub was reasonably well read  --  so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any issue of Playboy and he never would have known . But do n't crib Irwin Shaw . He loved Shaw , the class all knew that , he 'd told them , he 'd spent two weeks discussing " The Girls in Their Summer Dresses . " Hungerford was obviously a very disturbed young man . Just how fucked up , Chub had no way of knowing , but he knew that he had to find out . He left his office and went to the library , where old Durning was , as ever , at his main post . Durning smiled as Chub approached , saying , " You 've decided to come back and save me , I accept . " Chub kind of smiled , shook his head . " I need a big favor . " Durning said nothing . " Mr. Durning , you know everyone on campus ; there 's not a person in the administration you ca n't get to , am I right ? " " I 'd like to think so . " " Well  --  I 've got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at everything the school has about him . Whatever folders , background , school record , the works . " " They do n't much like to let those go around loose . " " I would n't ask you if I did n't have to . Please . " Durning looked at his watch . " Be in my office at four o'clock . You 'll have to read whatever I can get my hands on there . And I 'll need to return them before the offices close . " Chub thanked him . It was barely noon and he wished he had n't packed so he could pack then . He wandered across Tappan Square and there was joy in abundance  --  the weather , oddly , was bright and dry and classes were done . Kids threw Frisbees . Groups picnicked . Couples necked at the base of the giant elms . He went to the Campus , ordered a BLT on white toast , fiddled with it , left it untouched . Exorcist II : The Heretic was playing at the Apollo and Chub had heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the screen and a little laughter would have been welcome but the Apollo did n't open till six . The No-Name was shut too.  |p169Chub  went to his rooms and lay down ; he closed his eyes and dreamed of sleep , but inside of five minutes he was making a pot of coffee . He drank three cups the next hour , and by the time he was done he had decided several things . He already knew that Hungertordwas just in school for the ride . Sure , he was a senior but probably , if his work for Chub was any indication , he 'd be way short of the hours for graduation . Certainly he must have caused trouble before . If Hungerford was a semester or so short , it would mean that Chub could get him to drop the course , take something else in the fall . That way he would n't have to fail him and he could talk to the kid , explain that the best thing would be to get help . Hell , he was young , he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even get him to go see Patty  --  she was a good shrink , he knew that much . The folders lay on Durning 's desk . " I used up many favors , " he told Chub as he let him into his private room . Chub thanked him . " You have an hour , " Durning said , and he closed his office door , leaving Chub alone . Chub opened the top folder , began to read , feeling almost immediately the center sliding away . Hungerford 's father ( Oberlin , ' 50 ) had gone on to Harvard MedicalSchool , taken advanced study in surgery , was on the staff of New York Hospital , a man of not yet fifty , was already much honored in his field . Hungerford 's mother ( also Oberlin , ' 50  --  they married graduation day ) had also attended Harvard , earned a doctorate and was a psychiatrist and noted writer working in Manhattan . They had obviously been outstanding students . But their son and only child , Peter , put them both in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junior Phi Beta , and in his first three and a half semesters he had managed , as his worst grade , the grand total of one " A-minus . " And he was accepted at Harvard Med School in the fall . And he needed the writing hours to graduate . It was shortly after five when Chub knocked on the door to Hungerford 's room . " It 's me , " he said . " Fuller . " " I ley , pal , door 's open . " Chub walked in . Hungerford , massive and perspiring , was playing an Atari game. ( : hub saki they had to talk . I lungerford said great , but he had to finish the game first.  |p170Chub  said it was important . Hungerford kept battling the video game . He wore a T-shirt and jeans and the power of his body was never more evident . He had taken to affecting a crew cut and his dark hair and Germanic features made him seem almost frightening . The only thing about him that was n't frightening was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Surgeon 's hands . When he could n't take the wait any longer , Chub went to the wall , pulled the plug out , and the machine died . " Ordinarily , that 's an act of war , but since it 's you , pal , all is forgiven . " He smiled , studying Chub . " You do n't look happy . Sit down , tell Petey all your troubles . " Chub closed the door to the room , began talking almost in a whisper . Hungerford interrupted  --  " Hey , is this top-secret stuff , great . " Chub began to speak . " If I fail you , you wo n't graduate ; if I let it be known why I failed you , I ca n't imagine Harvard Med 's going to greet you with such open arms . So do us both a favor and cut the wise-ass shit , all right ? " " Hey , are you serious or something ? " I said cut it ! " " You 've got to drop the shoe , Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion . " " The subject is plagiarism and we both know it . " Hungerford stared at Chub in total disbelief . " It 's up to you now  --  explain yourself . " Hungerford shook his head . " What is this vendetta thing you 've got ? " " Vendetta ? " " Oh , come on , pal , you 've had it in for me from the first day when I was late . I worked my ass off for you and every other kid got a full hour of your time but you always had me out the door in twenty minutes . I do n't know why I rub you wrong  --  I should n't have made that remark about your book , maybe . But Jesus Christ , I never thought you 'd try and ruin me out of malice . " " It is n't malice , believe me , and I do n't want to ruin anybody . You plagiarized The Eighty-Yard Run ' and I want to know why " " What the fuck is " The Eighty-Yard Run ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You 're the one that 's doing something . "  | " I 'm not . I 'm just as confused as you are . I do n't want to fail you . I 've come up with a compromise  --  I 'm supposed to leave tomorrow but I 'll cancel that . I 'll stick around here until you 've written me twenty-one pages . That 's the requirement left . I do n't care how wide your margins are and I do n't care if all you do is type All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy . ' That 's as fair as I can be . I 'll pass you and nothing will go on your record . Is n't that fair ? " Hungerford sat in his chair , the look of disbelief still on . " Plus one more thing  --  you 've got to promise me to see some-body . " " Explain , please ? " " Someone to help you . Someone that 's qualified . " Hungerford smiled then . " Oh , that 's easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she gets a hundred an hour , does she qualify as being qualified ? " And then the smile was gone and Hungerford was out of his chair , slamming Chub against the closet door , and his hands were twisting Chub 's shirt and he was hollering now  --  " There 's nothing wrong with me , pal , if there 's a whacko in this room I 'm looking at him  --  I 'm not writing shit for you  --  I broke my ass for you and I do n't know what you 're after , but I would n't advise you to try getting away with it ! You do and are you gon na suffer " He dropped his hands , jerked the door open , and Chub , suffering , left . It was worse than he had thought  --  Hungerford was crazy . At shortly before seven , Chub rang the bell to Andrew Cheyney 's house . He carried a copy of Mixed Company along with " Saturdays Child . " Durning opened the door , saw who it was and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he needed to talk to Professor Cheyney . " Andrew 's a bit under the weather , " Durning said but then he looked at Chub 's face and said , " I know , I know , it 's important . " He led Chub into the living room , which was large and very contemporary . Chub had expected antiques . " Andrew , " Durning called then and a few minutes later , Cheyney , looking pale , entered . He was wearing slippers and dark socks with garters and a paisley print robe , and Chub started right in , explainingthat he was new , he 'd never taught before and maybe Cheyney had dealt with plagiarism before but would know what to do with the story turned in by Hungerford " Peter I lungerford ? " " Voisin " " Does n't ring the . I taught both his parents , I know them.  |p172They  've been very kind to the college . I 've kept tabs on Peter during his years here  --  he 's been a student leader all the while . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's The Eighty-Yard Run ' and here 's Hungerford 's work . " " What is " The Eighty-Yard Run ' ? " " It 's by Irwin Shaw  --  " Cheyney shook his head . " Fuller and Shaw , locked together for immortality . " " It 's very famous , " Chub said . " Fuller , I 'm a bit waspish this evening , what with a hundreddegreefever and all , but may I say that if it were very famous perhaps I might have heard of it . " He took the written material . " Let me go read . " " Thank you , and I 'm terribly sorry to be barging in but there 's one thing I want you to bear in mind while you 're reading  --  he wanted to be caught . I taught Irwin Shaw in class . " " This story ? " " No , another one , but that 's not the point  --  he knows , just like you do , I 'm a fan , and this is more than just plagiarism  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being . " " Oh , dear God , just what I needed tonight , an invasion from a Freudian . Allowing Sigmund Freud to be translated into English is the greatest mistake America has made since we allowed women the right to vote . " He gestured toward a chair . " Sit . I shall read quickly . " Chub did n't sit , he paced , and Cheyney did n't read all that fast , but when he returned he looked paler than before . Chub watched . Cheyney sat down heavily . " I admit I 'm biased  --  I like the family , I know the boy . And only a fool would fail to see the similarities . " " Then we 're agreed : It 's plagiarism . " " I do n't think so at all . " " What else could it be ? " " Oh , dear God , Fuller , there must be fifty stories about football heroes whose lives go bad . I think perhaps we 're dealing with coincidence  --  there is no reason for as brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hungerford to do a thing like this . " " I told you , he 's sick ! " " If you wish to stay in a civilized house you must behave in a civilized manner . "  | " I 'm sorry . " " And since his mother is one of the leading experts in the field of mental illness , I suspect she might have seen chinks developing , if chinks there were . " He dropped the writing on the sofa beside him . " There is only one thing we must do , and that is speak to Peter himself . " And with that , he reached for the phone . Hungerford , wearing sneakers and chinos and a clean white shirt , arrived after nine . He shook hands readily with both men . " What is this , a meeting of the Nobel Prize committee ? " " I wish there were more wit displayed on campus , but now is not the time , " Cheyney said . He indicated the sofa . " Sit down , Peter . " Hungerford sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-possessed , so goddamn calm . " Professor Fuller has some qualms concerning Saturday 's Child . ' Although I am in theory in charge of him , he is , in this case , in charge of you . I have read both your story and The Eighty-Yard Run . ' " Hungerford raised his right hand : " I swear on anything you want I 've never read that story . " Cheyney gestured for Chub to speak . " Peter  --  Peter , listen  --  the names of the main characters are the same  --  the last line , Once I played here ' is the same  --  the thrust of the narrative is the same  --  and there are eighty-yard football runs in both pieces . Tell me how you explain that . " Hungerford said nothing . " Peter  --  " Cheyney said . " This could be  --  is  --  a matter of some seriousness . You understand that ? " Hungerford nodded . " Then I feel it incumbent upon you to explain . " Hungerford said nothing . " Peter ? " Cheyney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head in his beautiful hands . " I never should have done it , " he said . " Tell us what you did , Peter . " Chub watched . When Hungerford raised his head again there were tears in his eyes . " I saw a TV show once years ago  --  I think Paul Newman was in it , and his wife too . I did n't get the name but I remembered it was an adaptation of something by Irwin Shaw and  --  " Ile looked at ( lull ) now . "  --  and Professor Fuller , I knew hep174loved Shaw and he 's been so fabulous to me this semester , he 's kind of one of us , being young and all  --  " He looked at Cheyney now . " You would have been fabulous , too , sir , I do n't mean any criticism , but I 've just loved the course and the great long talks Professor Fuller and I have had , these intimate kinds of one-to-ones , and I thought ... " A long pause now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he 's done for me , I wanted him to have a going away present . " " Present ? " Cheyney asked . Hungerford dried his eyes . " See , in the TV show , the main character 's name I remembered because my best friend 's name was Chris , and the girl 's name I remembered because I was in love with a girl named Louise then , and the last line I remembered , well , because it 's such a great line , how could anyone forget that ? " Now there were tears again . " The crazy thing is I thought it was a ninetyyardrun in the TV show but I know little about football and a run that long , well , I did n't believe it , so I changed it to eighty to make more sense . " Chub stared , thinking , omigod , he 's the one making sense . He shut his eyes now , opened them again , stared at Hungerford . He looked so sad , wringing his exquisite hands , his voice rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing the mirror with the lipstick message getting brighter . " I decided what I 'd do was write Professor Fuller an Irwin Shaw story . I thought he 'd love it . I could n't just come out and tell him what he 's meant to me , so I thought the story would send the message I wanted so badly to say . It was supposed to be this gift and now it 's a nightmare . " " Then you did n't plagiarize at all , " Cheyney said . " I 'm so confused I do n't know anything anymore , " Hungerford said . " The names , sure , the last line , sure , maybe some of the plot 's the same , you tell me . If you think I plagiarized , I 'll accept your word , Professor Cheyney . But I wish you 'd tell me why in the world I 'd do it . " " I do n't think you did anything wrong , Peter , but I can tell you now I did n't think it when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wait , would you mind ? " Hungerford dried his eyes a final time . " Whatever you say , ProfessorCheyney . " When they were alone , Cheyney said , " Well ? "  |p175Chub  sat silently , staring out at the night . Then Cheyney was on him : " Why do you want to make trouble , Fuller ?  --  what is it in you that thrives on trouble ?  --  I remember our first day in class you began making trouble and obviously you 've never stopped . " I hate trouble , Chub thought , and then Patty 's phrase " the bestest good boy , the bestest good boy " was echoing . " I 'm totally satisfied , Fuller . But you 're the professor in charge . If you want to take this up a step , we 'll visit the dean of men tomorrow . Side by side . And I will let you make your speech and then I will say when you are quite finished that I think you are wrong  --  dead , dead wrong . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble are you interested in stirring ? " Isolated and alone and yes , beaten , Chub thought of the plane taking off in the morning from Cleveland . " No more trouble , " he muttered . " Peter , " Cheyney called out then . " You are summoned . " Hungerford filled the doorway . " I am pleased to inform you that this incident is history . Men of good will can settle anything , I wish our leaders understood that . " And then he turned toward the sideboard . " Nothing puts a period on a disagreement like a glass of port , I insist you both be my guests . " He filled three glasses , made a toast . " To the end of an era of hard feelings . " Hungerford and Chub touched glasses . " Hey , we 're pals , " Hungerfordsaid , and he smiled at Chub and Chub realized , just before he drank , that never before had he seen a face that so desperately wanted to kill him ... .  |p179If  it had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life with her flashing green eyes , her pale red hair , Chub 's ensuing days would have been without color at all . The afternoon he got back from Oberlin he figured he 'd put in a call to Kitchel except he did n't . No deep reason . He just needed the time to readjust to the noises of the city after the quiet of the college town . He unpacked , decided , while the incident was still fresh , to put some Hungerford notes in his Journal , except he did n't do that either . It was a week before Kitchel called him . " Hey , " Chub said excitedly , eyes closed , lying on his bed , " what have you got , detectiveson me ?  --  you have caught me in the act of unpacking . " " Want to call me when you 're done ? " " No , Jeeves is here , taking care of the brute work  --  ironing my shirts and stuff . I 'm just overseeing that he does it properly . They do n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , hear this : There is going to be a magnificent dinner party chez Kitchel come Saturday and you  --  it 's against my wishes but the divine Lydia insists  --  are invited . " " Formal ? " " I shall be resplendent in my purple jogging suit , you may dress accordingly " Chub accepted and arrived , as always punctually , at seven-fortyfive . It turned out that he was the magnificent dinner party . Just the three of them was all . A catching-up time . Two-Brew was trimmer than ever . Lydia , horn-rimmed and smiling , was as dark as before only even more zaftig . They were going to move eventually , but they lived still in Kitchel 's old apartment , near the office . The place was still large , but a zoo no more . Lydia had decorated it . Danish modern , but not so much you couldn'tp180find a place to sit that was comfortable . There was the standard Manischewitz oldie to begin things , then a magnum of Taittinger , icy chilled . The appetizer was smoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lamb from Lobel Brothers . A lot of zinging back and forth , Two-Brew dominating with one overbearing pronouncementfollowing another . It should have been terrfiic but it was n't . By the time the lamb had disappeared , along with two bottles of Gruaud-Larose ' 70 , Chub , finally given the floor , was working his way toward the end of his Oberlin semester , and he told the Hungerford story with great care , because he was buzzed a little and he wanted to make all the story points clear and before he was finished , Two-Brew said , " Incredible material , " followed quickly , too quickly , by Lydia 's " Absolutely fantastic , " and Chub dabbed at his lips with his napkin , trying to forget the eye flick that should n't have passed between them . Over coffee and brandy , the zinging got worse , Lydia leading the way , arguing , nitpicking . Chub , silent now , did his best to concentrate on his brandy . There was no outright warfare , but when Lydia left early to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it was clear she did n't care if they talked or not , just so she did n't have to be around to listen . Chub finished his brandy . Two-Brew refilled his snifter . Chub swirled the liquid . " Lydia 's not herself , " Kitchel said finally . " Ah , well , " Chub replied , hoping that would do . " It is n't her work , " Two-Brew went on . She was proving to be a splendid editor , hardworking and not uncommercial , considering she was cursed with an Ivy League background . Chub said her success certainly did n't surprise him . Eventually , the trouble turned out to be children . Or rather , the ; lack thereof . They had n't really made a scientific attack in their first year of marriage , they did n't need the burden . But these last months their needs had shifted , and they did several months of planned intercourse , the middle of the month , that kind of thing . And they did n't dwell on their failures , Lydia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the sin was his : 1 le had to learn to live with the fact that his third leg had proved faulty . It swelled , it grew hard  --  nop181problem there , thank God . But it was difficult for him to accept the fact that his seed was insufficiently strong . Then , recently , he had screwed his courage and gone for medical testing . He was not the culprit . This past week irrevocable word had come from the doctorsthat Lydia , with wide-curving hips and a shape seemingly made for birthing , was barren . Doctors had made mistakes before , Chub said . " Of course , " Two-Brew agreed . " But for the nonce , you 'll have to forgive her . As I said , she is most definitely not herself these days . " Just how far Lydia had swung from her natural orbit came clear to Chub in July . She called him at home and he could tell the strain before she 'd finished , unnecessarily , introducing herself . " I 've heard of you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing  --  we 've never been much into paperbacknovelizations of movies but there 's a market , it 's there , and it would be foolish of us to keep ignoring it , and we 've got the screenplay for a Charles Bronson movie  --  he 's really a fine actor , do n't you think ?  --  underrated . And very popular in Europe too . And we 've contracted for a novelization and I wondered if you 'd do it , I 'll messenger it over and it 's thirty-five hundred dollars , and we need it in six weeks and I thought of you , you 'd do it so well . " " That 's very sweet , " Chub said , wondering what Two-Brew would say if he ever found out she 'd made this call , how much anger would spill ? " We like the story quite a lot  --  so you 'd just have to flesh out scenes , add description , we do n't want a total reconstruction or anything like that , may I send it over ? " Chub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever seen , and of course he was ignorant as to the ultimate success of the film . But writing quality was not something that interested the scenarist  --  gore was clearly foremost in his mind . It was a bloodbath picture , a bang-bang flick , with violence , it seemed , in at least every other scene . He glanced over it a second time without spotting much improvement , then put it down beside him on his bed . He had fifteen hundred dollars in the bank , he 'd saved that much from his Oberlin semester , so the money was n't absolutely essential . But Lydia was going through a had patch , and he 'd never done anything remotely like it ; technically , it might have some interest.  |p182He  did the first seven pages that night . He awoke the next day early and by noon had gotten up to page eighteen . Before he went to bed , he was closing in on thirty . And he felt sick . As a kid , he 'd always been a reader and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine get the toys over the mountain , would Pooh rescue Piglet with the honey jar . Then , as the battles from surrounding bedrooms began to escalate , his own room became increasingly important ; it was there he first met Poe and O'Neill and so many other Americans , before taking a breath , going across the oceans where Chekhov was waiting for him , and Turgenev and The Don riding with Sancho . He knew that he could never match the masters . But he also knew that what he could at least try to do was bring something into being that had never been put down quite that way before . More than any other single wish , he honored that . And there was no honor in the thirty pages that lay scattered around his typewriter . No human could contemplate the gore and be the better for it . Even the crap he 'd written growing up at least was his crap . On his desk now was nothing but orphan shit . Chub got up , thought of Wild Turkey , forgot about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months and it was n't going to make him feel better now . It was steaming in his bedroom . The building was n't wired for air conditioning though Mrs. Gonzales , the super , kept promising in both Spanish and English that " all that stuff " was " in the works . " Chub walked down the stairs and sat down on the steps of the building . Ninety-eighth Street was pulsing even though it was two in the morning , it usually was on hot nights , and the drunks in the single-room-occupancy buildings were hurling insults at the transvestiteswho managed , even in the worst weather , to parade in finery . Someone threw a bottle and it shattered , and for a moment Chub thought there might be combat , but then the street began to quiet and he looked toward Riverside and saw a black policeman begin walking toward the commotion . ( It was Rory L. Baylor and he was to become more than a good acquaintance in the future , but Chub had no way of knowing that then . ) The cop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Chub 's five nine plus , but he moved with graceful purpose and without fear , nod/ding and naming various drunks as he passed them , doing the same to the men in drag . Then he took a seat a few buildings down from Chub and sat , clearly in no hurry , and he stayed there till the potential combustion abated . ( Chub asked Mrs. Gonzales about him the next day  --  clearly the man had some power and he wondered what it was . The answer from the fat lady came accompanied by hand slashes : karate . The cop had killed with his hands . He had been a champion , had won the world a few years back in Tokyo , Japan . ) Chub sat for an hour , then climbed the stairs , lay on his bed , thinking of Lydia , and how would she feel if he called her up and told her about this great book he 'd just come across on the joys of adoption ? Sure , she was entering a bad patch , but she was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the money cloaked the offer in propriety . But what she was really doing was trying to spread her pain around and you did n't do that . No , you did not . He had never , not once knowingly in his life , demeaned another soul . It was close to five before his eyes began to close . He had several large fans in his bedroom and eventually the heat released him and he slept . He was up before nine , made a pot of coffee , drank enough for his head to clear , because he had to handle the phone call to Lydia with skill . " Hey , do n't hate me , " he began , when her secretary put him through , " but this Bronson thing  --  I ca n't find the handle . " " How so ? " " Well , I 've tried and I 've tried but I ca n't get started and I know you 're in a time bind and it 's really great of you thinking of me and all , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . " " You mean you 're passing ? " Chub sat at his desk , the thirty pages in one hand . " I 'll never get it done in time . I 've taken notes but I have n't written word one . I think it must be seeing a screenplay for the first time that 's got me whipped . " " I thought you 'd be perfect . " Chub laughed . " Well , of course , I am , personally speaking , withoutflaw , everybody knows that , but I do n't think I 'm perfect for this job . I really appreciate the offer , though , Lydia . " ' llxrc was a pause . " I 'll send for the screenplay this afternoon . " Another pause . " Chub , there 's a call waiting , got ta dash , ' bye . "  |p184Chub  hung up . He could tell she was pissed but he did n't think she could read anything in his voice , so that was one for his team . He went to his sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the phone rang and Kitchel 's voice was saying , " What the hell is this with you pissing on the Bronson novelization ? " Oh , Christ , Chub thought ; you knew . " Well ? " You could n't have , you could n't have . " Chub ? " " Dropped my watch , sorry . What were you saying ? " " I was saying that when I thought up the idea I felt pretty goddamn good about the whole thing . " It was n't your idea ; it could n't have been . You were going to be my Maxwell Perkins , do n't you remember ? In the blizzard you said that . And I was going to be your star . " I could n't think of anything better to get you untracked . " " It 's the time element , maybe  --  if I had a month , I could knock out thirty pages , I 'm almost sure I could , but  --  " " It did n't have to be a masterpiece . Graham Greene did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you even thought of me . " " How could you say no ? You could have forced yourself , you know . Writers have been known to do that . Thirty-five hundred is thirty-five hundred . " Agitation . " We 'll talk . " Click . " I 'm not a fucking charity case , " Chub shouted when the phone was dead . He slammed the receiver down then , ripped the thirty pages apart , decided to burn them , decided that was overly dramatic , decided he wanted to be overly dramatic , took his biggest pan , dropped the paper in , lit a kitchen match , stared till there were only ashes . Then the Wild Turkey for company , he lay down in bed , brought the fans close , nursed the bottle along . So what if Kitchel thought he was a figure on the dole ? Fuck Kitchel . Fuck Kitchel and fuck Cheyney and fuck his father and anybody else who wandered along . Sure , thirty-five hundred was thirty-five hundred but there were things you did and things you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass a hat for his funeral . He had talents . What , though ? Chub closed his eyes and listened to the fans , waiting for lightning . He always thought he was good at people , but maybe he was n't . He always hoped he 'd be good at writing , but maybe hep185was n't . And he never thought he 'd be good at taxis , and he certainly was n't . Or brick factories either . But -- and now he capped the bottle , got up , looked out at the blue summer sky -- but no one was better at libraries . EXPERT EXPERIENCED RESEARCHERSpeed matched only by accuracy . No subject too arcane . Low rates . Call 212-555-4001 ; seven days 9-5 . Three Sundays later , Chub stared at his ad in the back of the Book Review section . There were half a dozen competing researcherads , but his was unquestionably the best . He had not been in the Sunday Times since Joyce Carol Oates had called Under the Weathera " considerable achievement " ( some things you just remember ) but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just could n't feel bad about . And the day  --  you could n't bitch about that either . Cool and dry , that first hint of fall . He dressed , went out and celebrated by buying a couple of buttered bagels , along with a container of coffee , from a deli around the corner and spent the next hours watching a tight baseball game in Riverside Park between really good competing teams of Puerto Ricans . Then he took a long walk by the Hudson , stopping at the Seventy-ninth Street boat basin , where a couple of big yachts were anchored . On one of the yachts a party was blasting along , and there was a lot of laughter but , watching the tanned faces , Chub doubted the sounds . He lay down on the grass awhile , getting a start of a tan , and when the afternoon was moving along , headed back up into the Nineties , where his luck held : The Thalia was playing a Bergman double feature , Winter Light and The Seventh Seal , masterpieces both , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better even than he remembered . Getting dark now . He had n't eaten since the bagels and he treated himself to a pig-out at the local Hunan spot that had recently opened . It was after seven when he got back to his place and after eight when the phone rang . Chub answered and a male voice said , " Is this the ' expert experiencedresearcher ' that ran an ad in today 's Times ! "  | " Yessir , it is . " " Well , I have but one question . " Chub grabbed a pad and paper , got ready . " Shoot . " " How in the name of bleeding Jesus am I supposed to reach you between nine and five when there is no one there to answer the fucking phone between nine and five ? " Chub tried not to laugh at himself but sometimes he really was the asshole of the world : Obviously he had intended to be absent  --  who gave a damn about Puerto Rican baseball ?  --  because what if the phone.did n't ring ? Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a job , " he said . " I have waited for you , young man , because you were the only one who had the audacity to use the word arcane '  --  most writers have n't the least idea what it means . " See ? It really was the best ad . " I am Elliott double 1 ' double t ' Carter , " the voice said . Then : " Yes , the Elliott Carter to forestall your question . " Chub did n't know who in hell the guy was , though maybe he should have . ( Carter turned out to be a Donald Westlake type  --  only without Westlake 's talent  --  a factory in himself , who turned out close to a dozen books a year , mainly mysteries , under several pseudonyms . ) " A pleasure , Mr. Carter . " " And what is your name ? " Chub told him . " Well , Fuller , it comes to this : I am very hard on my researchers  --  Ifired my most recent one this very weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Carter . " " You are not the first to claim that . Here is my situation : At my present rate of speed , I expect to deposit my heroine into some quicksand by the end of this week and I find , to my dismay , that my Brittanica is of no use at all . Obviously , I do not intend to let her expire there . " Chub wrote the word " quicksand " at the top of his pad , asked a few pertinent questions : Did it matter where the quicksand was , seacoast or inland ? I ) id the time of year matter ? Was the heroine conscious or otherwise ? When he was done he said so . " I 'll have to read whatever you can come up with , " Elliott Carter said . " So I 'll need it by Wednesday . " " You 'll have it tomorrow , " Chub promised . It was so easy . There were over twelve hundred libraries in thep187greater New York area but a thousand of those were n't much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around in those two hundred though ; it was all at the main branch of the public on Forty-second and Fifth . Chub arrived before the place was open , was one of the first into the card catalog room on the third floor . There were n't whole books on the subject but my God , the periodicals . In the next hours he looked at probably thirty or more articles , scanned them to see if they fitted Elliott Carter 's needs , ended up selecting a dozen : from Scientific American ( June ' 53 ) and Science Digest ( June ' 75 ) and Reader 's Digest ( December ' 64 ) and American Family Physician ( volume 19 , number 2 ) , on and on . Then he went to the Xerox room and waited in line for copies to be made . He bought a large manila envelope , shoved the hundred or so pages inside and set off for the subway . Elliott Carter lived in a brownstone off Macdougal . He was probably close to sixty and could have passed for Nero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he quickly examined the material Chub brought him . Then he beckoned for Chub to follow him into his study . " Now to finances , " he said , taking out a checkbook . Chub handed him a scrawled paper on which he 'd listed his expenses , travel , Xeroxing , etc . " You do n't list your hourly rate . " Chub had n't known remotely what to ask for . " Sometimes I 'm really stupid , leaving off a thing like that . " " I paid my last researcher ten dollars an hour . " " That 's what I always get . " Carter looked at him . " I 'm a liar  --  I paid him twelve per hour . " " I 'm a liar too , " Chub answered . " You 're my first job . " Carter smiled , wrote a check , and Chub found himself on the sidewalk five minutes later , thirty-six dollars richer , not counting expenses . Thirty-six bucks . He taxied home . An unwise gesture , since that thirty-six was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But then Carter called again  --  " Could you kill a man by forcing him to swallow an entire tube of toothpaste ? " That one took awhile . ( Yes . But it would take a pretty dumb cop to let the cause of death go unnoticed . ) Carter wrote a lot and he also talked a lot , fortunately to other writers , and by Christmas , Chub was out so much he bought himself a present : an answering machine so he would n't miss any more calls . When the libraries did n't supply the proper information , Chub'sp188clients had him set up interviews with experts  --  a historian at Columbia who specialized on the slave trade in Zanzibar in the last century ; a wonderful Italian in Queens who explained the intricacies of the workings of a motorcycle dealership . Sometimes Chub did the interviews for his clients , sometimes not . Sometimes the research was tedious ( debutante balls in prewar London ) more often not ( crime  --  a lot of his work dealt with murder ; that was how he first came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . But all of it kept him off the streets , and within a year he had dozens of clients , and his price was up to twenty per , and he was earning four hundred dollars on a good week . And , of course , he was associating with real writers , sometimes every day . Soaked , Chub tossed his raincoat over the shower rod , kicked off his shoes , tossed them near the bathroom radiator to let them dry . He toweled his hair , cursed as another blast of thunder hit the city . It had been raining for three days , more on than off . He went to his desk , saw there were messages on the machine , clicked it on . Thefirst was from an old lady in Maine , a friend of Carter 's , who hated Stephen King because she had been working that side of the street before King was born only she 'd never hit it big . She needed information on lake monsters , not just Nessie in Scotland , but also the one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waited for the next message . A female voice said , " If this is Charles Fuller , and I mean the Charles Fuller , that noted author and literary figure , and if whoever'slistening is his secretary , please be sure that he is told that  --  Now do n't you beep at me , do n't you dare hang up .... " Excited , Chub listened to the next message : " Chub , this is B.J. I just hate machines . If you 're free for dinner , I can unthaw anything , " and then she gave a number . Chub dialed the number quickly and a little girl 's voice answered with " Whoever can this be ? " " B.J. , hi , " Chub said . " Bj. , " the kid said . " I 'm not B.J. " " Sorry , " Chub said . " You must be the maid . Would you tell your mistress that  --  " " I 'm the daughter . I 'm Jesse . You must get things straight . " " Sorry , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very deep voice . Anyway , this is Mr. Fuller returning your mother 's call . "  | " She 's in the potty . " " Fine ; when she gets home , tell her  --  " " She is home . The potty 's here . " Now a pause . " Just you hang on . " After a while , B.J. was on the phone . " I 'm so sorry  --  I was hanging stuff up in a closet and I did n't hear the phone . " In the distance , Chub could hear giggling . Then B.J. 's voice : " Did you tell ? " More giggling . " There are no secrets , " B.J. said back to Chub , and then , before they started to deal with the years , Chub asked was the dinner invitation still operational because he happened to have a break in his busy schedule and she said it was so they agreed to meet at her place at half past seven . That gave him several hours , enough to get some work he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was behind on . What he did instead was this : fuss about his wardrobe . Should he wear a tie or not . Should he wear his suit ? Maybe the summer blazer ? Still undecided , he went into the bathroom and shaved a second time . He 'd never done that before  --  his light-brown beard did n't require it and it did n't require it now but he hacked away , drawing blood at the crappy spot just under the nostrils . Now he got into the tub , soaked a long time , finally stood and showered with much soaping . Done , he studied himself in the mirror over the sink . Except for the little puffiness under the eyes , he looked okay . The same . The same 160 pounds , the same light-brown hair cut short , the same cursed round cheeks . He lay down next , closed his eyes to rest , realized it did n't matter a whole lot how he looked , it was Bj. ' s appearance , that was the thing . What had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably closing in on thirty , no sin , but goddamnitall , it was adolescent on his part , still he hoped she had n't faded . Redheads did that and B.J. 's hair , long and tumbling , was a very pale and very special red . At least special to some people . Some stupid people . The address was on Central Park West in the Seventies and Chub hoped for a cab . As soon as he hit Ninety-eighth Street an empty came by . Chub hailed it . The driver ignored him , roared past . Assuring himself that was not an omen , Chub ran for the bus . Bj. ' s building was old but fancy , and he told the man at the door that his name was hiller , to see the Ililtons , and after a phone check , hep190was directed to the automatic elevator with the instructions that it was the apartment on the right , fifteenth floor . He rode up accompanied mainly by a gnawing stomach . There were two apartments on the fifteenth floor and Chub took his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it awhile . His grey slacks had lost their crease in the rain , so he licked his fingers , went over the area by his ankles , doing what he could at restoration . Finally he rang , waited , and when the door opened he knew B.J. had entered into a pact with the Devil . Her hair was still long , still tumbled across her shoulders . But her green eyes seemed somehow brighter , her face the same face , perhaps younger , her starlet 's body as he remembered . She wore a white gathered skirt , a pale-blue blouse open at the throat . " You dear man , " she said . " Braving the elements for Swanson 's chicken . " She kissed his cheek , ushered him in . Chub followed . His wet loafers squeaked . " Those , " B.J. said , pointing down . " Off with them at once . Comfort is the order of the night . And how dare you wear a necktie in my presence ? " She went to the hall closet , hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she hung that up , too , draping his tie across it . The apartment was large , the living room enormous and dark , filled with overstuffed furniture . " Excuse this place , " B.J said . " It 's a two-year sublet and you ca n't always be as choosy as you 'd like . " " You 're here , then ? " " Ensconced this very week . " " There is no way that can be considered bad news . " " I 'll give you the grand tour but let 's have a drink to accompany us . " She walked ahead of him through some double doors into a library with a bar set up by the window . There was a terrace beyond . Chub watched the way her body moved , wondering if Del ever got annoyed with the world , knowing he had that to return to . She was putting ice in his glass when the phone rang . B.J. answered , said " Hiiiii , " then put her hand over the mouthpiece . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and she gestured for him to continue with his own bartending . Chub did n't feel the need , so he paused momentarily by the terrace doors and Central Park beyond in the storm , and beyond that , on Fifth , was the Kitchel place and he thought of his first trip , the Serendipity trip , and quickly turned away . I lc did n't like eavesdroppingso he pointed hack toward the living room and shep191nodded and smiled and when he was alone by the foyer Chub heard a child 's voice raised in incantation . " Rain , rain , go away , come again some other day , " over and over . He tracked the sound , paused noiselessly in the doorway to the nearest bedroom and saw , for the first time , Jesse kneeling by the window , looking out . She was probably five and he felt from their phone call that there was no world in which she was going to be a dummy . Her father 's brains , at the very least . Also , her father 's features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin and straggly . He must have shifted his weight because she turned sharply and Chub put a smile on fast , fast enough , he hoped , to hide his sad surprise : The entire upper right quarter of her face was on fire , the forehead , the eye , half the nose , the top part of her cheek . Chub had seen bad birthmarks before but never one like this . " I 'm Chub . " She looked at him a moment . " The potty man . " " In person . " " Well , I am Jesse , " she said , and then she held up a large doll that was kneeling beside her by the window . " And this is Big Baby . " She held out Big Baby 's right arm . " Pleasure , " Chub said , crossing toward them , shaking both their hands . As he grew nearer , the birthmark seemed to burn a deeper red . She turned back to the window , adjusting Big Baby into a positionparallel to her own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked then . " Indeed . " He sat on her bed a few feet behind her . " I just hate it , " Jesse said , and she half turned toward him briefly . He smiled , looked away from the birthmark , the sad red eye . " Iloved it , " Chub heard himself saying . " Best time of my life . " " Why ? " " Why , " Chub said . " An excellent question . Because of my adventures , " he said then . " You mean like putting on galoshes and splashing the puddles away ? " " That 's not an adventure , that 's a game " " What 's an adventure ? " ' DANGER . Travel . Excitement . " " When you were five ? " She shook her head.  | " Forget it , " Chub said . " You would n't want to hear about it anyway , you 're a girl . " He got up off the bed . " Girls do n't understand about adventure . They do n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tell me one . " " Okay , here 's the deal : 1 ' 11 start my first real adventure , but the second you do n't believe me , that 's it . " She nodded . Chub thought a moment more , then started talking quickly . " I come from a big family  --  lots of brothers and sisters , only they were older and I was the baby and they never liked to play with me much , and we lived in Chicago and then , when I was five , we moved to this small town called Athens miles away . All the rest were excited  --  my father had gotten this great new job and we took a big house , it was terrific  --  except , see , I was frightened . I did n't know anybody in Athens and I was really blue . And to make things worse , the first week we moved in , all it did was pour . All my big brothers and sisters , they did n't mind , they got to go out but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the truth , I was one miserable kid . Alone , new place , no friends , all that . " Jesse nodded . " Well , what I did was I 'd sit by my window in my room and sometimes I 'd just be quiet but a lot of the time I 'd do just what you were doing , sing Rain , Rain , Go Away ' over and over and that 's what I was up to when suddenly I heard this voice saying , ' Stop  --  that -- song . ' And then , right outside my window , I saw the Rain Man  --  of course , I did n't know his name then , but that 's who it turned out to be . ' I hate that song , it gives inclemency a bad name . ' I did n't know it either then , but he only appeared when it was raining . " ' Why ?  --  " I asked him that later , of course , and he looked at me like I was from Mars or someplace weird , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out at any other time ? ' Anyway , when he told me to stop singing , naturally I stopped and I opened the window so I could hear him better and he asked me what was the matter and I said I did n't know anybody and I was bored and he said , ' Excellent , come along with me , I 'm in the midst of a great adventure , ' and I said I could n't , I 'd get soaked to the skin and then he was talking loud again : No , no , you do n't get wet if you do it my way , ' and I asked what his way was and he said , ' You run between the drops , obviously . ' "  | " No one can do that . " " Forget it , " Chub said , standing . " It was only one of the high points of my life but you would have probably thought the part where I captured the Umbrella Fiend was dull anyway , your mother'sgoing to be off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked toward the door . " That was Big Baby , " Jesse said then . " She does n't understand about things . She told me to say that . " Jesse took the doll , put it in her lap , held it there . Chub hesitated . " It must be hard , though , " Jesse said . " Running that way . " " Do n't you think that 's what I thought ? I told him . He said for me to stick my hand outside . I did . Guess what ?  --  my hand got wet . ' Then he said , The only reason your hand got wet was because you did n't concentrate . Look at me  --  do I look wet ? ' " " Did he ? " " He did n't look so much wet as he looked strange ; he was shaped kind of like a tube , I guess ; you know , the way a raindrop is shaped when it 's falling , and he had a nice round head and then he began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand spin and circle and his fingers danced . " Do that , ' the Rain Man said . I did and guess what ?  --  my hand was still wet . You 're not concentrating , ' he said and this time I really concentrated and when I pulled my hand in it was dry and  --  " " Completely dry ? " Jesse said and before Chub could stand again she said , " Yes , Big Baby , completely dry , did n't you listen , he was concentrating . " And now Chub began to wave his hands again , watching Jesse watch them , and he lowered his voice and said , " Almost completely dry and suddenly he was excited , the Rain Man was really up and he said , You have the gift , I can tell , you can be one of the chosen to race between the drops and have adventures undreamed of by the ordinary , ' and I was getting a little scared now that he was going to ask me to come with him and I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm only five , maybe when I 'm six we can go off together , ' and he said , No ! No ! It has to be now , six-year-olds do n't believe anymore , they stop and they ca n't concentrate and four-year-olds are babies , I ca n't risk what they might do if the going really got tough  --  and believe me , the going gets tough when your job is to capture the Umbrella Fiend , which is where I 'm going now , this is your chance ,  |p194now  , you 're not a baby but you still believe and you have the gift but have you the courage to use it ? Have you the courage ? ' " " Free at last , " B.J. said , staggering into the room , feigning exhaustion . " Unfair , " Jesse cried . BJ. put her fingers between her lips and made a very creditable whistle . She pointed toward the bed . " Scoot . " " But I 'm not tired . " " Jessica . " " Big Baby is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Blood is soon to be spilled . I suggest you remove yourself . " " ' Night , " Chub said . BJ. picked up Big Baby in one hand , tugged at Jesse with the other . Chub waved , left the room . Behind him he could hear Jesse shouting : " Did you have the courage , I simply must know . " Chub called back : " It would n't have been an adventure if I 'd stayed in my room alone . " Five minutes later , B.J. was back in the library , and this time she did n't have to feign exhaustion . " Chub  --  who in the name of Christ is the Umbrella Fiend ? " Chub shook his head . " I 'm not sure Yet  --  I did n't know the Rain Man existed till a few minutes ago . " " My own Dr. Seuss . Will you tell her to please go to sleep , say you 'll tell her the next time . " Chub went back into the child 's dark room . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and kissed her . " I knew you had the courage , " Jesse whispered . " Big Baby said you did n't . She 's just wrong wrong wrong all the time . " " Sleep now , " Chub said . She closed her eyes . He was n't sure if she was tired or faking it but he watched her for a while . Dinner was not totally frozen . The lettuce salad that precededthe Swanson 's chicken was clearly fresh , and the strawberry Jell-O Jesse 's favorite  --  was recently made . There were just the two of them , Del being at work , and the conversation stayed mainly with college . It was n't till close to ten , when they were back in the library ,  |p195finishing  instant coffee , that it began to change . " 1 thought by now you 'd have asked how I succeeded in locating you . " Chub did n't get it . " I thumbed through my college directory  --  you know , the one they issue every five years . And there you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You 're listed ? I never dreamed . I figured there would be ninety Fullers and none of them would be you . " B.J. shook her head . " But you 're so well known . I mean , everybody I know read your book  --  of course , seeing as I was the heroine , that probably accounted for some of it  --  I was the girls of your dreams , that 's so . " " My inspiration , " Chub said , embarrassed but touched . " I thought everybody famous was unlisted . In Washington , page boys are unlisted . Do n't you get pestered ? " Chub shrugged . " You learn to deal with things . " " Is that why you 've got that monstrous machine that goes beep beep beep ' before a person can finish talking ? " " I guess it helps . " He did n't want to lie , he hated it , but as she pressed him it became apparent that she wanted so to believe in his success . Yes , Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copies of the paperback had sold . ( She clasped her hands : " A best-seller , I just knew it ! " ) And the novel , well , it was going great , it just was n't going fast . ( A sympathetic smile : " That 's why you creative artists have such a bum road . I 'm an interpretive artist , so it 's easier ; I would n't be anywhere without Tennessee Williams . " ) The first four hundred pages , they were typed and retyped and ready for publication  --  only they were n't even half the book . The next five hundred , well , they were done , but so rough you wanted to throw up , you could n't show them to anybody , and getting them right , getting them up to the standard of what was ready , well , it was n't corning  --  no , it was coming , but it was taking so goddamn long . ( A nod : " Well , that 's the way some people are  --  this Styron ?  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took him , think of that . " ) So doing research was turning into kind of a salvation  --  because that way , he could pick his own hours , do his rewriting when he was fresh , and the old juices were flowing . And you ? Well , the first year at Yale she 'd played Blanche in , Streetcar andp196that was an experience , because she did n't think she was ready but it turned out she was , they 'd all been knocked sideways , and of course she 'd done Juliet , which was fun . ( Chub remembered her Lady Macbeth and wondered if she remembered that as being fun too . ) And Del had studied and Del had studied , that was all he did , until second year , when he began talking about a baby and she did n't want one , not yet , but then he 'd forced himself on her one night , literally used his strength to bring her down and when she was pregnant she did n't know what to do , so she talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they could n't always bring life into the world and that was what she 'd already decided  --  she was from Texas , she was a good Baptist and when Jesse came , that was a real high point . Except it meant she could n't do her acting so she dropped out and Del studied and Del studied and then when he made Law Review that only meant he had to study harder and when he graduated he was given the chance to clerk in Washington , for a Supreme Court judge , no less , so off they traipsed to Washington and next Del got a job with one of the most influential law firms and he worked and he worked and she became his ornament . She gave parties  --  " catered ; believe me , he did n't want me cooking "  --  and went to parties and everyone thought they were the most delightful young couple until she went last summer to visit her Daddy and they were doing a little production of Streetcar in a little Dallas theatre and he practically forced her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the part , after all , she 'd played the part , and the run was only for a week and the reviews  --  just little ones  --  were all for her and the night the show closed she cried her heart out and her Daddy said , " I raised you to be happy , are you happy ? " and all she was was this ornament and when she told him that , that and how empty it all was , he said , " Child , leave him , " and she said she could n't do a thing like that and she went back to Del but it was the same only worse because the days were getting emptier so she packed up and went back home and yes , when she said before that Del was at work that was true , but he was at work in Washington and their divorce would be final soon and her Daddy sent her packing to the big city , with two years of money and then some , two years to pick up what her life had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . " So I guess you could say you 're looking at a fallrn woman . " Chub looked at her as he had throughout the night , but probably " Many . It 's almost like a harem . " " I 'm serious . " She was ; it was clear from the nervous tone to her emphasis . " I 'm right here , " Chub said . " There are n't a whole lot of places I 'd rather be . " " Then you better know it all , the good and the not so good . " She flicked on the bed light  --  she wore her half-slip as she had before . ' Ibis was the first time there had been brightness in the bedroom . Chub watched . B.J. stood , removed the slip , looked at him . Chub looked back . Her skin was splotched across her neck ; her hair was in disarray . That was about all that was different . " Well ? " " Well what ? " " You see it . " Chub shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she pointed to just below her navel . A scar ran down into her pubic hair . " Jesse was cesarean . Fucking doctor should have gone sideways but he did n't . " Chub did n't get it . It was n't that much of a scar . But she was working her way into something . " The stomach muscles were cut , do n't you understand . I could never lose this . " She gripped the flesh above her pubic hair . " I 'll never be flat again . " " Turn off the light , " Chub said . " And come here . " She did . Chub held her for a moment , then bent down , ran his tongue along the scar . " This is farewell , " he said , and he was about to go on when he could tell tears were approaching , so he held her again until she had control . Weird . That was the only word for it . I Jere was this glory confessing in embarrassment that her stomach would never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headsnappingcreature who made love only in total darkness lest her " disfigurement " be seen . Weird , indeed . But then , for some people , an " A-minus " was the same as an " E " Dinner with the Kitchels ten days later graded out to a " C. " No flaws with the meal  --  they ate at El Parador , the wonderful restauranton East ' Ibirty-fourth Street , which was one of Two-Brew 's favorites , and when it turned out that 13 . J. preferred Mexican to any other fiiod , the destination became obvious. : hub and KJ. were together constantly ( hiring those ten days . 1 lcp204was worried that she wanted time off , but if she did , it did n't show , since she was the one who always set up the next night 's assignation . " It 's not me who wants to see you , Lord knows , it 's Jesse . " For his part , Chub wanted to see them both . The only problem was BJ. ' s insistence on reading Chub 's book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't ready . But when she began to assume he thought she was probably too stupid to understand it , he gave in , at least partially , letting her have the section that dealt with the war and the wounding . She was the first to see it and he asked her not to talk about it , and she said she would n't , except to him . Which she did . Going over it with him , because she was rocked by its power , rocked and moved and how did he do it , how could he just pick words out of the atmosphere and make people , strangers , care ? Two-Brew and Lydia were already at the bar when they arrived . The restaurant did n't take reservations so they had a forty-minute wait until a booth was ready . They drank a couple of margaritas apiece and Lydia emptied a bowl of chips without much help , asked for a second when that was done . They were all a little buzzed when they finally sat down , and that was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning , when B.J. held Two-Brew in her arms for a very long time . Lydia watched from behind her horn-rims . Chub thought she looked fine , a little tired maybe , maybe a little heavier . At the booth they had another round of margaritas and B.J. tried explaining about the great beer-drinking contest at the No-Name . Two-Brew sat quietly , and Chub did his best to help but clearly it was the kind of experience you had to be there for . Menus came and Lydia said , " You all go first , I need time , " so the other three ordered . Lydia still was n't sure . Then she said , " Oh , what the hell , let me start with the guacamole and then the blackbeansoup and the special fried chicken . " The waiter nodded , took the menus back , when Lydia said , " And some nachos . With the peppers on them . " Two-Brew looked at her . " That sounds fine for an appetizer , honey , what 'll you have for a main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's that all about ? " " Why did n't you just order the whole right side of the menu ? " Lydia said , with great precision , " The nachos are for all of us . For the table , all right ? "  |p205Two-Brew  shrugged . Lydia finished half her margarita without talking . B.J. raised her glass then for a toast . Chub thought it was going to he for old times ' sake but instead B.J. said , " To my freedom : I am now officially divorced . " She reached across , took Two-Brew 's hand . " I 'm officially on the prowl . If you know any young bachelors , keep me in mind . " " You ca n't do any worse than Young Lochinvar here , that 's a certainty . " " True . " And now she put her arms around Chub , kissed his ear . " Onwards and upwards . " They all had guacamole and the plate of nachos was put in front of Lydia , who insisted they all share . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chub and Two-Brew excused themselves and headed for the men 's room . " Jesus , " Two-Brew said when they were alone . " You must be in hog heaven . " " The evenings pass pleasantly , I 'll admit that . " " Did you see the way people watched her at the bar . She 's sure something , all things considered . " Stung , Chub asked what the hell that meant : all things considered . " Well , Christ , Chubbo , what is she , thirty with a kid ? " " What are you saying , she 's in the final stages of deterioration ? " " Skip it . " When they got back to the table Lydia said , " B.J. loves Chub 's hook . " " Just the part I 've read  --  he 's very secretive but you know how artists are . " She smiled at Two-Brew . " You love it , too , do n't you ? " Chub broke in : " He never reads anything of mine until it 's complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's how we 've always worked . " Two-Brew nodded but Chub could tell from the way he picked at his enchiladas that he was pissed . He grew more sour as Lydia ate her fried chicken . The others had long finished while Lydia concentrated on getting every last bite from the bones . Finally , they had a quick coffee while Chub took care of the check . Then they took separate cabs home . On the way , Chub realized what " all things considered " meant . Two-Brew was flat-out jealous but that was understandable . Here he 'd arrived with the most sought-after crea/ture either of them had known , while at the same time , Lydia had chosen to balloon . The trip to Texas , in late September , was brief and terrifying . Chub had no intention of going and more than that , felt he had no business being there  --  the reason for the trip was personal on B.J. 's part . Her mother had died on the last day of September and she 'd made a private vow to always be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive to Plano , where the family originated and where all the Peacocks finally came to rest . When she first asked Chub to come along  --  it would just be a quick shoot , she explained , leave Friday afternoon , back the followingMonday  --  he begged off . She came at him again but he told her he did not like feeling the part of the intruder . That night , during her talk with Carlos , she suddenly shoved the phone at Chub and he found himself in stuttering conversation , listening as the voice said he would surely like to reacquaint himself with the famous fella he 'd met at his daughter 's wedding . Chub thanked him profusely but explained that business matters made problems for him , clearinghis schedule and all . He gave the phone back to B . J. and encountered Jesse eavesdroppingfrom the living room . She looked , the kid did , odd . Almost frightened , Chub thought . " I get to go to Texas , " she said . Chub said he 'd heard . " I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he just loves me so . " Chub waited . There was more . He could see her face working . " If only Big Baby was n't so scared . " " I did n't know Big Baby did n't like to fly " " Oh , she loves to fly , she just does n't like getting there . " Then she snapped her fingers , like a bad actress indicating . " Maybe you could come along . " She brought Big Baby up to her ear , whispered awhile . " Big Baby would like it , too , she really really would . " There was something in her tone . Chub scooped them both up into his arms . " Anything for Big Baby , " he said . The flight to Dallas was uneventful ; Chub discovered that he could play drums on his dessert pudding , using the round bottomedspoons for sticks , and Jesse got a kick out of that and if B.J. had n't made a remark , " People are watching " they might have gone at it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Chub found ftJ. ' s father surprisingly old and frail although J. Press would have found his attire impeccable . He stood at the exit gate and B.J. almost flew into his arms . She was five six and probably once he had been taller than that , but now their mouths were level when they kissed . Chub shook hands very firmly and looked the old man straight in the eye . ( His own father had taught him that when he was young and he kept the habit alive , though he never was sure why  --  Stalin was supposed to have had a firm handshake and Dillingerwas noted for always looking people in the eye . ) Then the old man bussed his grandchild and they started to walk , but in that brief touch , Chub saw it all  --  Carlos had carefully chosen the unscarred cheek and the look in his eye as he turned the birthmark away was so unchecked that Chub was suddenly hack in Florida and Gretchen was screaming about his dead older brother : " His eyes were blue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble , he slept through the night when he was a week old . " Chub took Jesse with one hand , lugged Big Baby with the other , following the Peacocks and wondering about people and how could they behave the way they did ? From a hundred yards you could tell that Jesse was special . What the fuck difference did it make that an unjust God had chosen to fire her face ? Then he realized he was as bad as the rest ; if B.J. had been a hundred pounds heavier back at Oberlin , there was no way he 'd be in Texas now . The Peacock mansion was located in Highland Park , the oldmoneypart of Dallas . The walls were filled , not with paintings , but more with large color photographs of the family . B.J. 's mother was prominent ( green-eyed , red-haired ) , and two handsome brothers , both of them living now in California , both in the aerospace business . ( The old man spoke of them without emotion  --  they were both almost forty , they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B.J. ( She had been one of those few who never went through an awkward age . ) And a single photo of Jesse , in profile , in the good profile . Dinner was brought in by servants . " Good old Texas beef " but well done . Afterward , Jesse was sent off to bed and the three sat around , talking , until Chub excused himself  --  it was obvious they wanted to engage in personal conversation , memories of the dead mother predominated , so he left , went up to tuck the kid in . ( Thep208Umbrella Fiend had concocted a monstrous plot to try to capture the Rain Man once and for all , but with luck and guile , they both escaped , and that night at dinner , when Chub told the events of the day , his mother said ( " That child , " Jesse interrupted . " What wo n't he think of next ? " ) Chub stayed with her till she was asleep , joined his host downstairs . The old man was tired now , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I 'm just down the hall , give a holler if you need anything , I can hear pretty good from there . " " He 's old-fashioned , " B.J. said as they finished their nightcap downstairs . " But he likes you . " " Mutual , " Chub lied . The next day was taken up with going around and meeting friends  --  which seemed odd to Chub , since a party had been laid on for that evening and all the friends came to the Peacocks . But he got through it  --  " No , he did n't know James Michener ; no , he did n't know Harold Robbins either . " Jesse stayed out of the way upstairs except for once when B.J. brought her down and led her quickly through the large rooms . Chub watched the other people watch the child . Half the ladies shook their heads in sadness when Jesse passed by . From what he 'd heard , California was the place that put the most premium on physical beauty ; from what he saw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sunday morning after church they started the drive to the cemetery . Jesse had never been before , but B.J. insisted ; she was old enough now . Carlos agreed but insisted the doll not come along . This was not a time for frivolity . Chub steadied the kid , went with her while she tucked Big Baby safely in her bed . Then she just stood there : What oh what if someone decided to steal it . Chub got a piece of paper and wrote a note and read it to Jesse : " This is not Big Baby . " He put the note beside the doll 's head , took Jesse 's hand , led her to the Cadillac and they both got in back . B J. asked her father if he wanted her to drive but he said no , he knew the way best and they began . He drove very slowly , not only in Highland Park but when they were outside of Dallas , aiming for Plano . Chub had no idea how far the place was , but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great spot not to come for your summer vacation . After what seemed like hours and well might have been , the carp209came to a halt by a river . Chub looked around for the cemetery , saw nothing . " Remember ? " Carlos asked . " How could I not ? " B.J. answered . Carlos turned now and pointed down toward the murky water . " Almost lost your mother there , " he said to Jesse . " If I 'd been five minutes later , you would n't be here now . " " You almost drowned ? " Chub asked . " Drowned ? " the old man said . " Heck no  --  that ai n't water , it only looks like water . You know what that is , Jesse ? " Jesse shook her head . " Quicksand , " Carlos said . " Good old Texas quicksand . You know what that does ? " Jesse shook her head . Carlos looked at his granddaughter . " It sucks you to death . " Jesse stared at the water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Hope to tell you I 'm not  --  see , we were visiting here when B.J. was , oh , maybe ten , and we went for a horseback ride and she got ahead of me and the next thing I knew she was screaming . See , she thought it was like a river or stream and then the quicksand had her and thank the Good Lord I had the strength to grab a branch and drag her safe but her horse , it just got sucked to death . " He put a hand on BJ. ' s shoulder . " Almost lost my girl . " Jesse was terrified now . " That 's all pure plain one hundred percent unadulterated bullshit , " Chub heard himself say . Now the old man glared back at him . " I 'm not a liar , son . " " ' Course you 're not , " Chub said . " But 1 know a little bit about quicksand and it does n't suck anybody anywhere . " " It happened , Chub . Daddy saved me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know I 'm grateful that he did . All Pm trying to get across is that he did n't have to . " He looked at the kid now . " Y'see , Jesse , I did some research once on this and quicksand is n't something to fear  --  it 's just a sand without enough foundation to hold you , so what you do is lie down on the top and just roll over and over until you 're on safe , solid ground . " " I saw her horse go down with these two eyes , son . " " I 'm sure you did , Mr. Peacock . And I 'm also sure that the animal probably thrashed and kicked and panicked . And it sank beneath the weight of its own body . "  |p210Jesse  was watching the two men now , her eyes flicking from one to the other , the terror still there . " For a writer , he sure do n't know a lot , " Carlos Peacock said to B J. " Ah , now there you 're right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , stepped outside . " Why do n't we prove how stupid I am . How about if I walk into the quicksand till it 's , say , up past my knees and then what if I lie down on the top and roll back to shore . I promise you I will be gooey "  --  almost a smile from Jesse on that word  --  " and I promise you my shoes will slosh , but I also promise you there is nothing to be afraid of because I will be here , all safe and sound . Does anyone believe me ? " Mr. Peacock said nothing , just gripped the steering wheel . B.J. said , " Get back in the car . " " Does anyone believe me ? " Chub said again , standing his ground . A quick nod from the backseat . Chub got back in the car . The rest of the drive was quiet . The cemetery , when they reached it , was small and might have been pretty had it been on a hillside . But they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father led the way to the grave . Carlos had brought a bouquet of flowers and he rested it beside the impressive stone , by far the largest in the place . Chub held Jesse 's hand , watching from a discreet distance . B.J. knelt when he was done , said a prayer , then beckoned for her child . Reluctantly , she released Chub , joined her mother . She was frightened again  --  who would n't be ; it was ridiculousbringing her along . The first grave Chub remembered belonged to his aunt and he was around Jesse 's age when he was taken there and it scared him then . When Jesse was done she hurried back to him and B J. knelt again and when she was done the old man took a very long time , talking to the flowers and the stone , sometimes directing his speech toward the ground . Finally they all trooped back to the Cadillac and Chub felt enormous relief . No more scares today . He could not have been more wrong . They had been driving no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , " Willya just lookee there , " and he was genuinely excited as he pulled off the road , staring and pointing into the distance . Chub squinted , unable to make anything out at first , but then he saw the dark spiral moving fast across the horizon . " It 's gain ' away from us ,  |p211hut  just lookit the size , " Carlos said . " I 'll bet you do n't get twisters in New York . " Jesse was already inching toward him when Chub said , " Are we ever lucky  --  see ?  --  that 's how Dorothy got to Oz . " Jesse stayed close to him and when the car started at last Chub assumed they were at last soon to be safe at home except the old man , excited , turned off , tracking where the twister had been , and in twenty minutes they reached the destination , a nameless crossing in the road . And the shacks on one side were as they always had been . But across the road , no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailers on their sides , children out of control , and Chub , watching the old man watch with building excitement at God at his most capricious , realized that Fitzgerald had been wrong : It was n't just the rich who were different from the rest of us . Texans were too . Jesse , in his lap now , said , her face against his neck , " This is how Dorothy got to Oz , " whispering it over and over until they at last drove on , and Chub , holding her more and more tightly , knew one thing : This kid in his arms now , this child with the fire on her face , was going to be safe . At least while he was around . He would protect her . From you name it on up and down . Even if it cost him dearly ; pain , suffering , death . The weeks following their return to Manhattan were filled with change . Jesse got a late acceptance at Little Dalton and B.J. lucked into a wonderful Colombian woman named Alicia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook . They arranged for Alicia to work from noon to eight at night , which for B.J. was only heaven . She also found a great acting teacher , " Better than Lee or Stella but low-key , " named Theo . He was Greek and his last name was unpronounceable but he had classes two afternoons a week and taught privately as well , so B.J. signed up for two extra sessions on her own . Not to mention singing lessons with an even-tempered Italian lady who was very old but had an impeccable reputation . Chub , for his part , found Rory L. Baylor . One of his clients who lived in Schenectady ( half of Chub 's people now were from out of town ) had signed for a series of superhero spy novels with a paperback house and he needed some difficult infi ) nation on karate . 1 lc explained to Chub , via letter ,  |p212that  he was ripping off the famous torture scene in the first Bond , Casino Royale , and what he needed to know with accuracy was how badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable his hero to quickly be able to function . There was n't much in the libraries ; not much of use anyway , it all tended to be how-to material . Chub was actually kind of pleased . He had wanted to meet the black cop since the night before he began researching , when Baylor 's very presence had quieted a potential explosion on West Ninety-eighth Street . Chub lucked out , finding Baylor during a shift change at the Twenty-first Precinct house just around the corner on West 100th , and he spent five minutes explaining who he was and what he did and what his needs were and , of course , compensation . Baylor said not a word during this time , just stared Chub up and down . " Fifty bucks an hour to talk about karate ? " Baylor said . " You shitting me ? " Chub , hoping the guy was n't going to blow his stack and decapitatehim with some chop he 'd learned in the Orient , rushed to assure the man that he was in no way shitting him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want . " " Cash . " " Fine . " Baylor looked at his watch . " Tomorrow night do ? " " Yessir . " " You 've got an honest face , Fuller . " " Thank you . " " Do n't thank me  --  I hate people with honest faces . " They met the next night at Chub 's place a little after eight . Chub offered him a beer and Baylor accepted and Chub was no morethan five minutes into the talk before he realized the guy was fantastic . Lighter-skinned than Chub had thought , but more powerfullymuscled in a T-shirt and chinos than in uniform , he spoke with remarkable precision . A little on the street side , but he could handle the language with wit and with color . He carried a typed sheet of paper , which he referred to constantly , on which were listed the proper spellings of various bones in the body . He did n't mind if Chub taped and he understood Chub 's client 's problems perfectly . " If we start with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attack . Do we slash at the inside , the outside , the back or the cap itself ? " Then he ticked offthe answers  --  the damage a karate blow would cause in each place , the bones that might be shattered , pausing to consult his paper so that the name of each bone itself was clearly put down . When he was done with the knee , he was equally thorough on various other body parts : the elbow , the shoulder , the ribs , on and on . If you did this to that , recovery time would be approximately thus and so . ( Baylor was to become a godsend for Chub  --  a remarkable number of clients were into mysteries and ignorant of police procedure . Chub used Baylor constantly . Sometimes getting answers by phone ; sometimes doing the interviewing himself ; on other occasions , if the author lived in town , sending Baylor down himself . ) It was almost ten when the cop was finished and Chub , happy he had gone to the bank that day , handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BS-ing awhile , and finally Chub felt that Baylor would n't be offended it he asked a question of his own : Had Baylor actually been forced to kill people ? With his own hands ? And what did it feel like ? Baylor took a long swig . " You mean karate-style ? " Chub did . " And this money here is mine , no matter what . " " It was a great interview , one of the best ever . " " Well , then , Fuller , I like you , in spite of that honest face you 're cursed with , so I 'll tell you the truth : I do n't know shit about karate . " Chub , stunned , sputtered that the entirety of Ninety-eighth Street knew of his championships . " That was a fucking rumor  --  started by me  --  I 'm scared shitlessof of all that chop-socky stuff  --  I 'm one-quarter Jewish , man , and we debate violence . " Chub broke out laughing . Baylor held up his typed page  --  " Now , my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she decided to learn to protect herself . She typed all this bone crap down for me . We need the money . I 'm starting law school this fall and it 's gon na take six years but when I get my diploma , I am leaving the force posthaste . A man could get killed out there . " lie stood up , put on his Windbreaker . " This is our secret , Fuller , and it 's gon na stay that way because first ,  |p214no  one in the area would believe you . And second , if they start to , I 'll just send my little minute of a lady up here to pay you a visit and she loves violence . " Chub thought , when they shook hands good night , that they both knew it would not be for the last time . He was busy the next evening too . He had to cancel dinner with B.J. because when he was working up in the Bronx at the Museum of the American Indian Library ( an honest biography of Geronimo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch to get his messages and found that Elliott Carter ( the Elliott Carter ) said to call . Chub did , immediately , and found that Carter needed some material dealing with how would you make tarantulas bigger , how would you enlarge a cobra ? ( A mad-scientist epic was clearly in the works . ) Carter asked if Chub was busy and of course , even though the answer was yes , he said no . Carter had been the reason for so much of his business that even though he never told the old man , he always put everything else aside , regardless of the hassles it might cause . So he subwayed to Forty-second and Fifth , and they did n't have much ( who could possibly have much ) , so he took the Lex local number six , got off at 103rd , legged it quickly through the dangerousstreets until he reached the New York Academy of Medicine stronghold , probably as good a medical library as any anywhere . They had material on cobra venom and serum and a lot of unpleasant-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next guy ) with accompanying text , but it was n't until he tried " Growth " that he found much that Carter might find useful . But the material was scattered and also overpoweringly scientific in jargon , and Chub had to ask the librarians more questions than they wanted to hear . He Xeroxed what he could but he realized as he did so that he had a long night ahead  --  he would have to type up much of the material , collate it into coherent groups , put down as many definitions as he knew . It was three in the morning before he slept , then he got up early , handed it to Carter before ten . He was due at B.J. 's that night at six , which gave him time to do a little more Geronimo stuff , take a nap and write a stern letter from the credit manager of Bloomingdale 's complaining for the very last ( underlined ) time that Big Baby had overdrawn her account.  |p215After  Jesse hugged him he handed her the note . " Doorman gave this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , proud of her reading  --  she was a whiz from watching . Sesame Street  --  squinted at the typing , handed it back to Chub . You read and I 'll tell if you 're doing it right . " They went into her room , sat on the bed along with Big Baby , who was propped comfortably , her head resting on the pillows . " Big Baby what ? " Jesse said , when Chub was done . Chub explained awhile : Bloomingdale 's was a store that sold things , accounts were ways of paying without paying , overdrawing ( lid not have anything to do with using real cash . " But she never goes shopping alone , " Jesse said . " That 's not what this indicates , kiddo . I 'll bet she 's been hitting the high spots while you 've been in school . " Chub shook his head . " ' 11us could be trouble . " He reached out his hand . " Give me the other Bloomingdale 's letters . " Jesse just looked at him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part where it 's underlined ? See where it says very last ' time ? Well , that means there must have been earlier letters . Let me have ' em , I 'll try and get to the bottom of it . " " This is the very first one . " Chub studied her . " You 're not just trying to protect certain people ? " " I promise . " Chub heaved a huge sigh of relief . " Well , if you promise , that means it 's so , and if it 's so , everything comes clear  --  it 's those stupid computers at Bloomingdale 's  --  they goofed . They 're famous for that . Mind if I keep this ? " She did n't . He folded the letter , stuck it in his pocket . " I 'm gon na call that credit manager tomorrow and really let him have it . If he does n't send a written apology , he is going to be one sorry cookie . " ( The credit manager was distraught , and from then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accompanying note . One week a training bra , the next a copy of Remembrance of Things Past in the original . I Ic was clearly a man of unpredictable tastes . ) " Ile is going to be one sorry cookie , " Jesse told her mother the night the first letter arrived . ' They all three ate together now , early , because Alicia needed to be done with the dishes and gone byp216eight . Chub delighted in the early meals , because not only was Jesse with them , the food was fresh , warm and always bore a clear resemblance to what it was originally intended to be . B.J. listened to the story of the computer mistake , and she nodded at the right times , always paid attention . But Chub sensed 11very definitely something . Later , after Jesse was asleep and they were alone on the couch he started going on about some of the Looney Tunes jobs he had , how he was up till three typing material for a writer who , a century and a half after Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't want to hear about it , " B J. said . " Sorry . I do n't blame you . " He reached for her hand , and she let illhim hold it , but only for a moment before pulling it back. li " I do n't want any sex tonight . I 'm tired  --  no , I 'm not tired , I 've got a headache . You believe that ? Well , do n't . " Chub waited . " I 'm pregnant . You believe that ? Well , do n't . " " What 's the matter ? " " You do n't get to ask that , that 's my question , What 's the matter ? ' Only I know the answer . " " Well , I wish you 'd share it . " She looked out at the October night . " Oh , come on , " she said finally . " Obviously I 've done something . " You sure have . You have changed , and I know when it happened  --  atthat Mexican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you my divorce came through , which makes me , what 's that terrible word ?  --  oh , yes , available . ' You 've been scared ever since . " " Oh , bullshit . " She looked at him with her green eyes then , and for a moment , Chub thought there might be tears . Then she was up , moving sharply away toward the bar . She started to make herself a drink , but her fingers could n't get the ice out of the bucket . Her back to him she said , " I thought maybe we were into something . I wanted that . " " Same . " " Then why are you all of a sudden going on about your work  --  Del did that  --  I left him before I died of boredom  --  I 've got a life , too , I do n't hear you asking many questions . And why did you pick ap217tight with Daddy ?  --  the place I almost died and you had to make a scene . " " I was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than either of us  --  when was the last time you tried to calm me ? " Chub started up toward her . " You listen ! You sit right there , because maybe you have other women , but I do n't have other men and maybe you think that 's because I ca n't , but believe me , I get hit on . In class the other actors , on the street , the goddamn strangers . Just because I 'm damaged goods in your eyes does n't mean I 'm ready for the ashcan . " And now she started slowly toward him . " Do you hear me ? I need a man . But care has to cut both ways . " Chub reached out for her . She took his hands , stood over him . " All I 've tried to do for months now is make you happy but I want that too . I want to be an equal partner , I want a man beside me . " " I 'm not going anyplace , " Chub said . Chub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first grown-up suit . " A navy-blue pinstripe she 'd helped him select at Paul Stuart . Actually , she did the selecting entirely on her own , and when he went into the dressing room to try it on , she asked the salesman if he minded if she " took a peek , " and when the salesman said , " Not at all , madam , " B.J. went into the dressing room and pulled the cloth curtain shut and chatted with both the salesman just outside and Chub . " Is this the best fabric you have ? " she asked and the salesman assured her it was of the very finest quality and " Do you think it will prove durable ? " she asked and the salesman said he had no doubt that it would and she asked Chub to " turn this way " and " now that way " and all the time she chattered on her hands had unzipped the fly and were massaging his cock , watching it grow and finally B.J. said , " It may be too big but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just the way it is , " and then she zipped his pants , patted the bulge , left him alone to await the return of normalcy . The ceremony was very brief and intentionally small . It took place the week before Thanksgiving in BJ. ' s living room . Carlos flew up from Dallas . ( This was after much scuffling  --  he wanted to give a " shindig " but B.J. said he had given her one of those , withp218half the town in attendance , and the marriage had been miserable . This time she was doing things the other way around . Carlos finally agreed when she said they would honeymoon over the Christmas holidays back home . Ordinarily , when given such news , Chub might have balked , but not much was bothering him these days . ) TwoBrewwas his best man , tit for tat . ( Later , Chub and B.J. roared over the conversations between Kitchel and Carlos  --  they had eyed each other with extraordinary wariness from the beginning , each being convinced the other had descended without warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so did Alicia the Colombianmaid , standing in the farthest corner of the room . Most attentiveof all was the kid , who whispered occasionally to Big Baby . The minister was an oddball nondenominational type Chub had hustled up in the Village . He seemed a trifle buzzed when he arrived , blew the ceremony several times , most noticeably when he forgot the business with the ring . Fortunately , the chief participants rememberedand after everything was legal , Carlos took the bunch to " 21 " for an absolutely ordinary meal . Chub had arranged for a suite at the Navarro on Central Park South , and he insisted on a large terrace in the front . ( He had seen the view once in a movie  --  the park , from up high , looked like a giant Christmas toy from Schwarz 's , the tiny cars obeying the traffic patterns , the lights changing color , the skaters at the Wollman Rink like dolls . ) After they 'd showered and before they made love , B J. put quilts around them both and they went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they gathered together in a single quilt , their naked bodies giving warmth . They touched each other gently and B.J. repeated that now , at last , at thirty , she had had her happiest day . Chub kissed her breasts , his eyes shut tight , knowing at last he was on the come again , because of all the people in all the world , he alone held not B. J. Peacock or B. J. Hilton but B. J. Fuller in his arms . It was early in January when Del Hilton made such a brief but telling reappearance in Chub 's life . When Chub beeped in for his messages at mid-afternoon , there was Del 's voice , asking could they meet , say , at the Palm Court of the Plaza at five . He 'd be there anyway , regardless , and listen , there 's no reason for anyone else to know . Chub recognized him immediately . Del was totally bald now , butp219he still wore the old-fashioned rimless glasses , still possessed the same quiet strength . They shook hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move on so they could talk . Over the familiarViennese music , Del said , " I 'm glad you could come , I wo n't take much of your time . " " Think of me as yours , " Chub said . Del smiled , but behind it , Chub could see the emotion . Then Del did a st. ange thing : He reached across and took Chub 's hand and held it briefly while he said , " I 'm just so goddamn grateful , I had to tell you face-to-face . " " For ? " Jesse . I just came from a visit . I 've never seen her in better shape . She really loves you , Chub , and God bless you for that . " " I figured I was doing okay  --  Big Baby asks to sit in my lap sometimes now . " " I gave her that doll the week she was born  --  new father , what did I know , I went out and bought her this thing ' that was bigger than she was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head . " That was the hardest thing for me , Chub , when I left B J. Leaving Jesse too . " You left B.J. ? Chub thought . Del caught it . " She told you she left me ? That 's fine . Probably now she thinks she did . It is n't so but it 's okay . Why do you think I have such miserable visiting privileges ? When I moved in with Michelle I knew it was n't going to be a creative ' divorce . " " Michelle ? " Del gestured toward a woman sitting by herself at another table . " I 'd like you to meet her when we 're done . Terrific lawyer but a better human being . " Chub glanced at the lone woman and thought how it must have racked B.J. when Del left , and not just the rejection . Michelle was older than Del  --  she looked close to forty  --  and she was very , very plain . " I would have taken off two years sooner than I did except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " I 'm told she 's very strong . " " She is again now , now that you 're around . " " You two were so golden back in school . It 's none of my business , but what happened , Del ? " Del I lilton took off his rimless glasses , got a handkerchief fromp220his back pocket , took his time in cleaning . " I do n't know  --  I suppose I realized I could n't make her happy  --  and I 'm not talking bed  --  and the harder I tried , the more I failed . It 's hard to survive on failure . " He put his glasses back on . " But obviously that 's not your problem  --  I can see that in Jesse 's face . " Chub smiled . " So far , so terrific , " he said . Which was , of course , sort of true , and sort of something else he did n't understand . The week after Thanksgiving they were having breakfast coffee at the round table in the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while B.J. padded around the room in her nightgown . She said , over a second cup , that it seemed to her a little schedule-rearranging might prove beneficial to all . Chub asked how so and she said , well , since Jesse was picked up by the Little Dalton bus at eight , and Alicia did n't come till twelve , and all her lessons and classes were in the P.M. , it seemed to her that four hours alone with the man she loved was something she could deal with and happily . Chub explained that she was right but if you researched in libraries and you got there when they opened , you had the places pretty much to yourself and could get a lot done quickly , whereas if you got there at noon , you were entering a zoo . And it meant that by the time he got up to West Ninety-eighth Street , which he 'd kept as an office , he might have to work later . She listened and nodded and smiled . Then she took off her nightgown and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay , but a quiet card catalog is hard to find . " They compromised . Chub stayed until she began to dress for the day , around eleven or so . They compromised on his night work too . Unless a particular expert was essential and only available in the evenings , Chub found somebody else just as capable , which worked out well , because they could go to so much more theatre , on Broadway and off . They liked The Elephant Man and Whose Life Is It Anyway ? and B.J. was insane over Sweeney Todd because it would be a great part for her when she was as old as Angela Lansbury . But she hated They 're Playing Our Song because Lucie Arnaz was younger than she was and not half as good and probably only got the part because Lucille Ball was her mother . Chub survived the two weeks in Texas well enough , except for Christmas Day . He had known for a month what he was going to give B J. but it took some doing  --  a leather-bound album filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the library and explained what he wanted and cost was really no object and Durning came through for him , and then some , finding pictures not just of the leads she played  --  The Philadelphia Story , Kiss Me Kate , Macbeth  --  but also others from her freshman year , when she was just a figure in the chorus of Oklahoma ' , a secondary part in The Trojan Women . He bought the album at Mark Cross , the highest-quality leather they had , and in a color of green that almost matched her eyes . She loved it , she just loved it , and said so many times " B.J. is just so touched " and Chub was pleased , of course , until that afternoon when he began to remember Gretchen staring at her leather-bound copy of Gone with the Wind . They had their first fight , squabble really , in January , a few weeks after his meeting with Del in the Palm Court . When they were done with coffee she said , taking his hand , that the most wonderful idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she said that it was n't enough to tell him , she had to show him , and with that she led him to the library and gestured around . This , B.J. said , this would make the most wonderful office for you and you would n't have to trek to Ninety-eighth Street anymore . Chub was surprised at the strength of his negative reaction . Because , in truth , he was ashamed of what had once been his home . He was embarrassed by the shabbiness , had never allowed B.J. to visit  --  it would have humiliated him to let her see the way he lived . What was so wonderful about Ninety-eighth Street ? Nothing . But writers have offices to go to . Of course they need offices ; but they do n't have to go to them . " I need it . " " I would most certainly be interested in finding out why . " " I just do . " " A masterly explanation . " What could he say ? That Isaac Singer maybe lived there once ? Ridiculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were married now , everything was theirs , and she was being gracious enough to share . That having it made him feel like a grown-up ? True , but he could n't explain what that meant to himself , not logically , so how could he expect her to understand . " It 's cheap and I 've got a terrific lease . " " Will you at least consider sometime in the future working here ? "  | " Of course . " " We 'll talk about it some other time , then . " Pause . " This lease ? When 's it up ? " " June . " " We 'll talk about it in June , why do n't we ? " End of discussion . They had their first fight  --  not squabble  --  early in March , the day Jesse turned six . A few weeks before , Chub asked her , when he was putting her to bed , if there was anything special a special six-yearoldmight want for her birthday and Jesse said , " Oh , yes , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : an electric wagon with pedals , and the next afternoon he went to Schwarz 's to buy one . No one at Schwarz 's knew what he was talking about . Odd , Chub thought , as he walked up to Rappaport 's at Seventyninthand Third . Rappaport 's was equally ignorant . That night , after they were done defeating the Umbrella Fiend , Chub asked the kid what she wanted for her birthday , because Jesse had a remarkable ability for changing her mind . " I told you , did n't I ? A ' lectric wagon with pedals . " Chub kissed her good night , buried his head in her neck till she was kicking with laughter , left her in the arms of Big Baby . " I am having difficulty finding a goddamn electric wagon with pedals , " he told B.J. after they 'd bathed . " A what ? " " You tell me , but it 's what she wants from me for her birthday . " " Oh , do n't pay attention , she just got gobs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ton more . " " I said I 'd get it for her . " " Well , forget about it . " She was sitting naked at her dressing table , putting lipstick on her nipples . " A girl in acting class told me that this turned her boyfriend on . " She stood , flicked the bathroom light out , the bedroom light too . " Tell me if it turns you on . " It did . But he could n't forget the electric wagon with pedals . He made his money researching , for God 's sake ; that was his job , finding things . And he knew , somehow , he was going to find this . He called the national headquarters of Toys " A " Us . They werecourteous and they gave him all the time he needed . No electric wagon with pedals.  |p223He  got in touch with the people who manufactured Flexible Flyers , on the odd chance they made items other than sleds , such as maybe electric wagons with pedals . He tried the Lionel Train people too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chub tossed in the towel . He had work that needed doing , work that paid , and he 'd tried . Two days before her birthday he was consumed with the notion that he had n't tried hard . And so at last the Great Researcher did what any fool would have done : consulted the Yellow Pages . There were three columns of retail toy stores and he started alphabetically . Naturally , Zeffman 's of Canal Street was Valhalla . " I 'm sorry to bother you , sir , but by any chance , do you have an electric wagon with pedals ? " " A vat ? " Clearly Mr. Zeffman  --  that was who it turned out was on the other end  --  was not born in Darien . " An electric wagon with pedals , sir . " " No . " " I did n't think so . " " A vagon vit pedals I got , but it ai n't a plug-in . " Chub shifted the phone to the other hand , massaged his neck , which was killing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain wagon with pedals would at least prove he 'd made the effort , whatever the hell it was . " If I came down , would you show it to me ? " " It 's in a big box , you got ta put it together yourself . The truth ? It 's a crap item by me . Everything they make is a crap item by me . " " Everything who makes ? " " The goddamn company , the Lecto Company , who vants to assemblenowadays wen you can just shove a goddamn cartridge in a machine and blow up the world ? " " I 'll be right down , " Chub said , and half an hour later he was . Mr. Zeffrnan went into his basement , returned with an enormous box . " This is the Lecto vagon vit pedals but by me you 're a dummy for buying it . " Chub looked at the box . There were no pictures of the contents . " Can you describe what I 'm getting ? So I 'll know what it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " Yell , as I remember , it looks like a vagon . It 's got a long handle . You put a kid in it and you pull the handle and it 's a vagon . But  --  and I 'm yarning you , it 's a dead item , I do n't take no returns  --  the half in front of where the kid sits lifts out  --  and below is pedals . The kid holds the handle vile he 's sitting , he vorks the pedals with his little pudgy legs , he 's on a bicycle . Fifty-nine fifty without tax , and I should n't take your money ? " " Why ? " Chub asked as he paid . " You handy ? " Chub shrugged . " Like the next guy . " " The other two next guys who bought this lox , it took ' em four hours to put it together . " It took Chub eight . He closeted himself in the maid 's room and sweated away . Eight hours , not counting breaks , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the blood blisters that appeared on the fingers of both hands . B.J. , naturally , gave him no sympathy but probably he would n't have given her much , either , if she 'd spent most of two evenings cursing in the maid 's room . But when the magic day arrived , and after all the other gifts had been opened , Chub said , " Oh , there was this thing today that arrived , maybe from the credit guy at Bloomingdale 's , " and when he wheeled it out , red and shining , Jesse screamed , " A ' lectric wagon with pedals , " and hopped in saying , " Pull me , pull me , Daddy , " and when Chub did she said , " Lookit , Mommy , lookit us go , " and Chub wheeled her through the living room to the library and opened the terrace doors and it was cool and grey with a March wind building but neither seemed to care . They struggled briefly with the front part of the seat but when they got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peddled and laughed , zooming around the terrace , circling endlessly , and when B.J. joined them she shouted , " See , Mommy , you thought it was a wagon but it 's got pedals . " " And we 're into the one hundred and ninety-second lap at Indianapolis , " Chub said , " and we may just have a major upset on our hands , ladies and gentlemen , because no electric wagon with pedalshas ever won here in the past but with eight laps to go , Jesse Fuller has the lead . " Jesse made another circle . " Seven , " she cried . " Six , " Chub said into his microphone after the next terrace tour was done . " And the noise here is fantastic , ladies and gentlemen , ap225six-year-old girl with six laps to go may be about to make racing history . " " B.J. loves your birthdays so , " Chub heard then , and he turned , stunned , not knowing what was coming but knowing more than likely that there was soon to be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were always changes when she began referring to herself that way , in the third person . ( Their first night ? " You 're boring him , B.J. " when she caught him looking at his watch . ) Chub was n't certain what brought it on , but it all was in the region of some terrible insecurity . " B.J. remembers those other days so well . " " So do I , Mommy . " " Those other days B.J. 's presents used to fill you with such joy . " " They do , Mommy . I love your presents . " " Of course , B.J. knows you do , she can see all those other presents where you left them , left them all by themselves in the living room . " " And the crowd is giving Jesse Fuller a standing ovation , " Chub said . " A hundred thousand people  --  " The kid began to slow . " Finish the race , " B.J. said . " All those other presents do n't matter when there 's a race to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then at her mother . Then she scrambled to her feet and said , " Oh , this old thing , " and ran . Chub began to clap . She turned to him . " Does B.J. detect a certain sarcasm ? " " Cut the third-person shit . " " Oh , his command of the language is overwhelming . " " That was a shit thing and you know it . " " You want to know what I know , mister ? " and they moved toward each other in the center of the terrace . " Tell me . " " I know what you 're up to and it 's not going to work . " " Let 's hear it . " " You are my husband and I am your wife and that is fine with me , at least on most occasions . But that child is my daughter , I have the scars to prove it , and none of your games with credit managers or stupid stories or goddamn gifts can change that ! " She whirled and was gone. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blindly at the park . Because the insecurities he knew about , and the possessivenesscame as no surprise , and yes , her jealousy came with the territory . But now the extent of it rocked him  --  she was jealous of his relationship with her child , Jesus God , even of that . And he realized as he stood there the depth of his bind . B.J. dazzled him , blinded him , she always had , always would . But he could never lessen his affection for the child . He adored her . Adored her . It was beyond relinquishing , outside his control . And there was no way in this world that he could ever please them both . He tried . That night , he explained  --  not apologized , explained  --  while B.J. listened silently , that sometimes he acted obsessively and this had been one of those times . He probably should n't have gotten involved with the wagon in the first place but the fact that he could n't find the damn thing ate away at him , since his job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those hours , not only drove him almost round the bend but at the same time gave him an almost cuckoo sense of pride , since he stank with his hands . Which was why he had brought it out last , after the other gifts . If he was going to give it to her , it should have just been there at the beginning . And if he was fond of the kid , that was because the kid had been brought along beautifully , and someone in the room with him now was responsible for that . B.J. liked that . The next night at dinner Chub gave Jesse a letter and said she better read it . She looked at the letter awhile , handed it back , suggested Chub do it out loud . It turned out to be a note from the credit manager at Bloomingdale 's , explaining that he had been transferred to a new shop they were opening in a mall outside of Tokyo , Japan . It was a big break for him , but he doubted that he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tokyo took ages to cross the water so good luck to Big Baby and the next time she was outside Tokyo , please drop in and say hello . B J. liked that too . What Jesse liked was that Chub began altering his schedule . There were a couple of afternoons a week when Jesse was home from school while her mother was at class , and ( ; hub turned out top227he there on those afternoons , working . But he did n't mind interruptions . Sometimes they would tell stories then . Other times , if the weather was nice , he would get the wagon out of the back closet and sit in it and let her pull him around the terrace . She was six now , he explained , which was when you had to start to work for a living , at least that 's when he did , so quit griping and pull , and he told her what it was like , being the youngest person to work in the local brick factory . It was three weeks before B.J. felt like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of a Katharine Hepburn picture . Summertime . They watched it on the tube one night and B.J. moved into his arms , talking not about the movie but about where it was located , Venice , and how she had been there twice with her folks and it was the most romantic spot in existence . Or at least the most romantic place she had ever been , because although she had always dreamed of going to an island in Hawaii , Maui , which a girl friend of hers in high school had said really was the best place yet invented , she had somehow failed to get there . The weather warmed , and Chub began taking afternoon walks with Jesse , and the first day the carousel in Central Park was open , they were there . Chub gave her a quarter and told her to have a go but she hesitated , studying the horses as they went around and around , wondering were they all the same or were any of them better to ride than the others and Chub suddenly said , pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastest . " She squinted at him . The fastest ? How could that be when they all go around the same ? And then he was into the story of a girl named Jenny who was very poor , so poor that all she had was one quarter , and she used to come to the carousel every day and pretend to ride  --  she never could really do it because then her quarter would be all gone  --  but she studied and studied all the animals and one day figured out that the black horse was really a whiz and just holding back so the others would n't feel like plodders . Jenny knew that , and her knowledgealmost made her the lifelong slave of the richest boy in all the world . " Who ? , . " You mean his name ? " Chub said . " Ills real name or what people called him ? " You know . "  | " He lives right over there , " Chub said , pointing to an enormous apartment building on Fifth Avenue . " The richest boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partment just across from me ? " " There 's a little difference , kiddo  --  the Flibberty-Smythe 's live in the whole building . Really just the top thirty floors . The rest is for their staff . By the way , the richest kid 's name was Chauncey Van Rensselaer Flibberty-Smythe . I would n't want you associating with him , though . A rotten egg all the way through . " Chub looked down at her beside him on the bench as the carousel music changed tunes . " Well , there simply must be more to it than that , " Jesse said . Chub took off , explaining how that Chauncey Van Rensselaer Flibberty-Smythe was in a horrible mood , because usually when he came to the carousel his social secretary called the Mayor and cleared everybody away so he could have it all to himself but this time she had goofed and Chauncey , being eight , was furious to find other children riding , and he told his three butlers to throw them out but the parents objected and Chauncey , fuming , stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing his bad habits , tried to cheer him up by telling him what a good time he would have on the black horse since it was the one with real speed , and he said she was dumb , they were the same and she said she was right and he said wrong and she held firm and then Chauncey made her a bet  --  she could take the black horse and he 'd take the white one alongside and if they finished dead even , then he was right and if he was right she would have to be his slave forever but if she was right , if the black horse won , then he 'd give her a lifelong supply of quarters and Jenny was afraid , but he taunted her and made mean fun so finally she had to agree and they got on their horses and the carousel started and both horses were neck and neck , dead even , and Chauncey laughed and laughed because she was so dumb and Jenny did n't answer him , just bent forward and whispered " Giddyap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and around , the horses the same , exactly the same , and then the ride was half over and then three quarters over and then it was almost done , you could tell because the carousel began to slow and Chauncey was screaming , " At last , at last , a slave all my own , " and Jenny kept on with her " Giddyap , horsee , please , please , you must gddyap . " Chub stood suddenly , waved toward I3.J. , who had just called out " Hello " and was walking toward them . Chub went to her , kissed her . " Alicia said you might be here . Class broke early . " " Great . Sit , sit , we 're just watching the animals and getting a little sun . " Jesse nudged him and whispered , " Did she win ? " " What was that , darling ? " B.J. asked . " Nothing , " Chub said . " Just goofing around . " " Oh , then I 'm interrupting , I did n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . " We were finished , " Chub called , grabbing Jesse by the hand , giving her a look , hurrying alongside his wife . He took her hand , too , and between his ladies he strolled awhile . After dinner that night Carlos made his normal call and the instant B.J. was seated talking in the library , Jesse scooted out of her room , gestured for Chub and when he was seated on the bed she said , " I 've told Big Baby everything up to what you said so go on . " " Right . " Chub glanced at the door , started talking . " See , there was this rich kid named Chauncey Van Rensselaer Flibberty-Smythe and he lived in a whole building  --  " "  --  the race , the race , Big Baby knows all this . " " The race . " He paused , but only briefly , and when he spoke again his voice was very low . " The carousel was slowing , the horses were even , Chauncey was screaming because he had won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely moving . The horses were just the way they 'd always been . Even . Absolutely even . " Now his voice sounded strange . " And then . Then . " The words came very slowly , a breath between each one . " And then the .. . and then the greatblackhorsebeganto moooooooove . " It reared up on its hind legs and Chauncey began to blubber like a baby he was so scared and Jenny hung tight , and the black horse circled the carousel , faster and faster , and then it gave a cry of freedom because it was n't an ordinary horse , it was a magic horse and years ago an evil sorcerer trapped it in the carousel and no one knew , and it could only get free if someone believed that it was thep230fastest , and then it gave a great jump , right out of the carousel , and it ran a few steps across the grass and then it leaped , leaped right off the ground , because magic horses , they can fly when they want and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse , and on its back rode the richest little girl in all the land . " Chub stood , started tucking her in . " Did they have adventures ? " Jesse asked finally . " Oh , plenty . " Then she was quiet again for a while . " I wonder , " she said when Chub had her all tucked in . " Hmm ? " " I wonder did they ever meet the Rain Man ? " " We 'll find out , kid , wo n't we ? " He grabbed her then , probably too hard , and pressed his lips against her birthmark , against her beautiful special fire . B.J. was finishing up when he joined her in the library . " Chub sends his best , " she said , and then a moment later , " ' Bye . " " How is he ? " Chub asked . B.J. smiled . " Daddy ? Daddy 's clever . But he 's not as clever as some people , is he , now ? " Chub made no reply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the park , trying his best to figure , in the darkness , just where the carousel might be . May turned quiet . No fights , no heated words , but more than enough silence to go around . B.J. went up for a couple of open calls , barely got through the door . Because of her acting teacher , it was his fault , Theo was just a faggot who should have stayed in Greece and she quit him . Jesse got sick a lot , nagging colds , and she did n't seem to mind missing school . Chub , watching them as the days dragged on , realized in his own spectacular way that in trying to win them both he was , in fact , doing the reverse . There had to be a shift , sudden and good , and so he went to his bank , took out all his savings , did some heavy spending , and the next night , at dinner , he clanged his fork against his water glass for attention . " I have news of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said to Jesse , " is about to have her half-year anniversary , so she has cause for celebration . " He turned to B.J. " And your daughter has just finished finally and forever kindergarten and first-graders-to-be also have cause for celebration . " Ile took an envelope out of his pocket.  | " And I , not wanting to be in the way , have decided to take off on my own . " He tapped the envelope . " Inside here is my plane ticket for the island of Maui in Hawaii . I leave on Monday . " Jesse stared at him . " You 're going away ? " Chub flipped her the envelope . " Look inside if you doubt me . " Jesse fumbled with the envelope , spilled the contents onto the table top . " But there 's three things in here . " " Impossible , " Chub said , examining carefully . Then he shook his head . " Dumb travel agent . You 're right . Three tickets . " He gave a deep sigh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think about that ? " It made for a lot of flying . Five hours to L.A. , then a wait . Five more to Oahu , then another wait . A short hop to Maui , a long cab ride to where Chub had booked . No one had trouble sleeping when they got there . The resort strung out along the beach , a series of low cabins shaded by palm trees . They had connecting rooms on the second floor , Chub and B.J. took one , Jesse and Big Baby shared the other , but Chub took great pains showing her that all she had to do was open her door and there they would be , in case Big Baby had any worries . They were punchy the next morning , but awake in time for a late breakfast and to catch up with the counselor who took care of children during the day . Jesse wore an enormous blue sun hat because she had to keep the birthmark protected , and B.J. made her promise to keep it on , which Jesse did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front door and the door to Jesse 's room and made love to Chub with the terrace doors open so they could hear the ocean . When they had come she held him and said " Thank you " and she gestured to the rooms , to the water beyond . " For this . " They swam in the waves after lunch . B.J. had bought several new one-piece suits for the occasion , because she insisted she was five pounds over at the very least , the winter always did that to her . The suits were white , and they set off her bright-green eyes , her tumblingred hair . She looked , as always , stunning . Chub looked like Chub  --  he still weighed the same 160 as always , so he had bought nothing new , made do with what he had . Jesse returned from camp in the late ; diet-noon , fuming . All they did was splash in dopey wading pools and play with dopey clay andp232she hated it because there was only one thing she wanted to do and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sand . She was a city kid , born and bred , D.C. , Dallas , New York , and she had never seen an ocean beach like this before . So the second day she got some cardboard beer cups and they let her alone in the sand , just in front of the cabin , so they could keep an eye on her . Chub went out with her at first , showed her how wet sand was better for building , but not to go into the water above her toes to fill the cups . And that was how she spent the day . Kneeling on the white beach , in her blue suit and giant blue hat , until B.J. went out and put a beach robe on her because the sun was strong . The old folks rested on the terrace in lounge chairs , ordering lunch in when they were hungry . They talked quietly and dozed and read , B.J. ploughing through War and Remembrance , Chub the collected Cheever . When it was five , B.J. suggested ordering cocktails and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonic or what ? " I 'm busy , ca n't anybody tell ? " Jesse called back . B.J. phoned for two very tall rums and sodas and a Shirley Temple , and when the drinks arrived , she told Jesse to leave some beach for tomorrow . " No , no , no , no , no , I 'm not finished . " Chub went out to get her . What she had built amazed him . It was a castle , five feet long at least , and beside it was another building , smaller , but there was a road connecting the two . Chub sat beside her cross-legged and watched her labor . " It 's beautiful , " he said . " Well , it will be , " she told him . " See , this is the Rain Man 's home "  --  she indicated the castle  --  " and this other place is where the magic horse sleeps . Except the stupid side keeps falling down . " " Jessica , " B.J. called . " Give her a sec , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join them . " You 've really done wonderful work . I 'm proud of you . But there 's a Shirley Temple inside with your name on it . " Jesse shook her head . " No . Not not not not yet . " Chub stood . " Let 's us get sloshed . " " Jessica , I told you to come along . "  | " But this is the Rain Man 's house , " Jesse said . " And the magic horse 's house is n't finished . " B.J. grabbed her daughter 's hand . Jesse struggled free . " Jessica , you are ticking me off and do I ever mean that . It does n't matter if you finish it or not  --  the tides are going to take it away , now come along . " " Tides ? " B.J. pointed to the ocean . " The water comes in at night and washes everything away . Then in the morning it goes out and you can play some more . " " Take my castle away ? It ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will , now get up . " " Maybe it wo n't , " Chub said . " These Hawaiian tides are very unpredictable . " B.J. whirled on him . ' just do n't start , all right ? " With that , she was on her way back across the sand . " C'm on , it sounds like Mommy means business . " " But I worked hard . " " I know . Get up now . " Jesse stared and stared at her creation . For a moment Chub thought she was going to burst into tears , but she was a tough one . She reached for his hand and held it . " I think the Rain Man is friends with the tides . " " Ca n't be sure ; they 're both water and all , but  --  " =I 'm sure , " Jesse interrupted . " My castle will be there in the morning . " Chub should n't have done it . He knew it during drinks , he knew it during dinner . He knew it when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could help himself , so he stayed awake and before dawn was more than a wish , he slipped out of the cabin , crept out the door and down to the beach , did the best he could reconstructing the castle and the house . He worked frantically , and probably the job was n't perfect , but then , neither was he . When he was done he tiptoed back into the cabin and fell asleep . " It 's there ! " Jesse cried the next morning , waking them both as she shook their bed . Chub , exhausted , took a long time to wake and when he did , B.J. was already sitting up , rubbing her eyes.  | " You must hurry come see , " Jesse said . " Come see what ? " B.J. said . Jesse started bouncing up and down . " Just you wait . Now I 'm serious , put on your suits , put on your suits , " and B.J. got up slowly , Chub , too , and when they were in their suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " See ? See ? I told you they were friends , " and Chub smiled , watching her , because she was just so goddamn bursting . B.J. smiled too . " B.J. is just so happy , " she began , and then she was on him , screaming , " You cute little miserable son of a bitch  --  " and Chub said for her to shut up because sure they had fought before , gone at it pretty good , but never like this , never in front of the kid . " You and your fucking games ! " she said and then began to kick at the sand castle wildly , and she lost her balance , fell , got up , kicked again and again until she was winded . Then she grabbed Jesse and shook her  --  " He did it , do n't you get that , he did it , and he did it to get me , do n't you get that , do n't you see ? " and now Jesse was crying , in fear , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chrissakes to get control but she was past that , way past it . " Why do you do it ? Why do you have to ruin everything , everything you touch you ruin , you know that ? Prick ! " and B J. was crying now , and she slapped at Chub , slapped hard , and he did n't bother stopping her , just let her go on until she dropped her arms and ran sobbing toward the cabin . Chub sank down on the sand . He bent forward , rested his head on his knees , shut his eyes . He was n't aware for a while that Jesse was sitting beside him , mimicking his position . Chub kissed her hair . " Go inside , baby . " " I like the sand . " " Please . " " It 's so nice and quiet out here . " Chub looked around . He did n't know what time it was but it was still very early  --  the beach was empty . He watched the water . There was a blissful morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves . They rolled in evenly and without conscience , maybe a beckoning foot high . " Mommy has some temper , but it always goes away . " Chub stared at her . Jesus , six years old and she was tending him . He blinked.  | " Are you going to cry too ? " Chub shook his head . He never cried . Not true . He had . In the sweet long ago . Probably when he felt his father 's pulse on the hospital table , probably that was the last time . " No , baby , I 'm not going to cry . " The wind was picking up but the sun was strong enough . A perfect day . A perfect day . " Scoot , baby , I mean it , now . Go on inside . " " With Mommy like that ? " A shake of the head " You are some creature , " Chub said . " Creature ? I 'm a girl . " " Yes , the best girl . " She was . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , was n't he the bestest good boy ? " I 'm going for a walk , " Chub said then . " Me too . " They started along the sand , slowly , Chub on the water side , but after a little he veered away , moving into the calming blue , until he was almost up to his waist . Then he turned , walked through the waves . " I would n't do that , " Jesse called . " Do what ? " " Go in the water like that . " " Why ? " " Why ? Why ? Because of the sharks , that 's why . " Chub smiled . She was six and Jaws was four years old but it was still one of the main conversation cornerstones at Little Dalton . " Do n't worry , " Chub said . She skipped along the water 's edge , peering straight ahead of his path . " I 'm keeping an eye out , " she shouted . " Jesse , you can relax  --  the truth is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within three miles of the shore because they ca n't break their deal with the dolphins . " " What is a dolphins ? " " Did n't I tell you when I was on Maui before  --  why do you think I decided on here if I did n't know about it ?  --  and I ran into the dolphin ? " " Louder . " They were probably forty feet away from each other now and the waves breaking on the beach made it hard for her . " Amway , this dolphin  --  " is this going to Ix  --  a story ? " she shouted.  |p236Chub  shrugged . The sun massaged his shoulders and the water was warm . " Just something that happened is all . " She took a step into the water . " If it 's a story I must hear it from the start . " Chub laughed , moved in , took her by the hand , very gently and gradually led her out , waiting each step until she was n't afraid . When the water was almost to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and each time a wave came , it broke on his body and he lifted her high so that she laughed , and then put her down again . " Well , this dolphin  --  " "  --  what was his name ? " " Jesse , it 's been years since this happened . " " Well , you must "  --  now she giggled again as another wave broke and Chub lifted her over it . " It makes everything better if you know the names , " Jesse said . " Umm , lemmesee , now , he saved my life , you 'd think I 'd remember  --  gotit ! Milton . His name was Milton  --  dolphins are very religiousand they all have names from the Bible . " Another shriek , another wave . Up ahead was a long breakwater and Chub decided to reach it before turning back . Maybe he 'd even let her sit on it awhile and watch as he dove in and swam around . " This Milton saved you ? " " He did indeed . Now , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her past another wave  --  " but I learned to swim underwater . I 've always been great at it , so naturally when Oberlin entered a team in the World Plunging Championship to be held here in Maui , I came along . Plunging means being able to go the farthest underwater . " She nodded . The breakwater was closer now . " Well , I did n't know about this three-mile rule with the sharks and I swam way out to practice plunging where none of the Japs could spy on my secrets , and first thing I run into  --  " "  --  a shark . " " Right . See , I was just past the three-mile limit and this shark  --  I want to tell you I was scared and the next thing I knew  --  it all went so fast , this shark was flying out of the water up in the air and it landed and made this huge splash and then turned tail . See , that 's why sharks are afraid of dolphins  --  dolphins swim faster and they have this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's belly andp237knock them flying and when I was safe Milton  --  he did n't talk so much as squeal , but they 're smart , some people think they 're smarter than we are  --  anyway , Milton indicated I was out too far and I said I 'm sorry , I did n't know , and I was tired and I told him , so he said  --  squeaked , I mean  --  ' Hop on , I 'll give you a free ride . ' " " Did he ? " " It was like flying . " " Tell me , tell me every little thing . " Chub wanted nothing more than that , to tell her every little thing about his ride , and he was about to when suddenly he was spinning down into the water , his face was in the sand and his mouth was open and he fought the water , made it up , realized instantly what had happened , the waves had caromed off the breakwater and blindsided him and he had been so busy talking he had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stared around , shouting , Jesse , Jesse , Jesse , " but she was not to be seen , nothing was to be seen but the waves and the water and standing there , spinning around , shouting his lungs out , Chub knew she was dead . ( She was n't . She 'd just been stunned longer than he had been , and the water was harder for her to fight . Perhaps it took ten seconds before she would reappear , gasping and frightened , eyes so wide , yelling , " Daddy , Daddy , I was scared . " ) But in those ten seconds Chub 's mind flew because he was a murderer now . He had killed the thing he loved , not with a sword or a kiss but with a cursed story . And that would take awhile to forget , ten eternities if God was on his side , only that would never be , God hated bestest good boys when they did bad things , really bad things , and then Chub thought of B J. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I killed her , I killed the baby , " which meant she had been right all along , he had wanted to steal Jesse , only this was the ultimate theft , and before their marriage ended would be the lowering of a tiny coffin into the Texas ground , only she would deny him being there , she would be right , he had done the deed , was n't that enough for any man , and then Chub 's thoughts took a turn for the worse , because he knew he would never have the courage to do unto himself what he had done unto others , he would have to live with the knowledge that what B.J. had just screamed at him was true , he was a prick , a prick who ruined everything , everything he came near , always had , always would andp238surely there was a name for him except it had not been invented yet , no one had needed to make up such a word "  --  Daddy , Daddy , I was scared . " Chub lunged toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen feet away from him and another wave knocked her down but he managed to keep his feet this time , and before the third wave struck his fingers held her fingertips , but only briefly ; it was that third wave that blasted her away.  |p243Chub  met The Bone the night Two-Brew was anointed . Mr. Kitchel had not wanted to give up being head of Sutton Press , had no intention of doing so . He was but sixty-one in 1982 and yes , there was company policy involving mandatory retirement at sixty-five but since it was his publishing house , he did n't foresee any trouble sidestepping that problem . He was , in his own eyes , good for years to come . The problem was that , in the eyes of others , he had not been good in the years just past . When The Thorn Birds came up for paperback auction , Two-Brew had begged , in company meetings , that they grab it , no matter what the cost . Mr. Kitchel scorned him . When James Clavell left Atheneum , Two-Brew pitched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break out on a gigantic international scale . More scorn . The same argument took place when Stephen King left Doubleday . The same scorn . No one at Sutton could accurately compute how many millions of dollars those decisions had lost but everyone knew that the son had become far shrewder than the father . And sooner or later there would of necessity come the changing of the guard . But it would be later  --  common gossip in publishing had it that what kept Mr. Kitchel in power and would keep him there at all costs was his deep supply of scorn : He loathed his son now . The more of a threat Two-Brew became , the more the father drew pleasure from disagreement , overruling , frustrating , winning , no matter what the bottom line might read . Then came the offer . Just as Atheneum had been formed a quarter century earlier by three top publishers leaving their firms and setting out on their own , so in ' 82 three more top men decided to begin their own firm.  |p244There  was a lunch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two-Brew not just to come along , they wanted him to head things . Two-Brew said he would think about it and get back to them . That afternoon , he wrote his resignation and met with his father . Mr. Kitchel read it , read it again , looked at his son and said , " You could n't run shit . " ( This was the most cordial remark of the meeting . Chub heard it all from Two-Brew , via phone . That had become their most common method of communication of late , except for an occasional lunch at a local Hunan when Lydia had n't " felt up " to joining them . ) The ensuing battle was surprisingly brief  --  less than a week was all . Mr. Kitchel discussed the betrayal with his latest mistress ( another friend of his wife 's ) and with Mrs. Kitchel herself . And he was stunned to find they both felt the same : He had worked so hard , too hard really , all his life , and now was the time to begin enjoying his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now triply betrayed , spent a mostly restless night thinking of how he might most viciously rewrite his will . The next day he received two calls from Sutton 's best-selling writers wondering , idly , if the rumors about the new firm were true . Mr. Kitchel explained that there were always rumors and pay no attention . But the meaning beneath both calls was clear : They were thinking of leaving . That afternoon he wandered into his son 's office and asked how long he had to make a decision . Two-Brew said he would give him till Friday . His father stared at him then and said , " After all I 've given to you . " Two-Brew stared right back and said , " After all I 've taken from you . " ( Alone , he immediately called Chub because the battle was , he knew , won . It was simply a matter of surrender terms . " It 's fucking Sophocles , Chubbo  --  only I ai n't marrying Mommy . " ) On Friday , Mr. Kitchel summoned his son and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( True . And the bill of health was clean . ) " The quack said that I should begin taking it slower . I said that I could n't slow down , it was full-out or stop . He said could n't anybody else fill my shoes ? I do n't think you can but you 're my blood , I 'll give you a shot . You can be CEO , I 'll be chairman . " " You can be charwoman for all I care , " Two-Brew replied . " Who has the power ? " The answer to that question became clear when the announcementswere sent out , inviting very special friends of the firm to ap245party in a private room at The Four Seasons honoring Stanley Kitchel and his new position . Each invitation was signed by Mr. Kitchel himself , with the word " proudly " preceding his name . Chub dreaded going , but Two-Brew really wanted him there , so there was n't any choice . There was n't much reason for his dread , either , because , after he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that very few people there knew him . It had been a decade since Two-Brew had rescued him from working at the No-Name . Besides , if you had been a fly on the wall , you would have clocked a lot of funny stuff going on . Example one : At the center of the room five people were greetingguests . Mr. Kitchel , his wife , his wife 's friend Helene , his son and a young girl who was trim and Peck and Peckish , the assistant head of publicity . The eyeplay was glorious . Mr. Kitchel ignored his son and Helene ( his mistress ) . Two-Brew ignored his father and the girl assistant ( his mistress ) . But a really perceptive fly would have soon given up this scene for what was going on at the glorious buffet table , which was long , and had identical platters of delicacies set up on both sides . On one side stood a fortyish grey-bearded skinny guy who might have tipped the scales at a hundred and thirty pounds . His companion , a bloated brunette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty pounds . And across from them was a genuinely startlinglookinggirl : probably six one in heels , extraordinarily thin , with eyes like Paul Newman , chalk-white makeup , which contrasted with jet black hair . And what was going on was this : While the bloated brunette kept a continual motion going , stuffing shrimp into her mouth , the thin girl across was stuffing shrimp at an equal speed , first into her napkin , then into her purse . It would have been , seen from above , a terrific race . Who could make more shrimp disappear faster ? The skinny grey-bearded guy noticed what the thin girl was doing . " Bite your tongue , " the thin girl said sharply . The grey-bearded guy looked away . Soon after , a small commotion began  --  the assistant publicist moved alongside the shrimp stealer , started asking questions . " Do n't bug me , okay ? " the thin girl said , gesturing across the table toward the skinny bearded guy who was watching again . " I 'm with him , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the grey-bearded man , who eventually nodded . The publicist moved away . A smart fly would have moved on then , too , because the race was done as the thin girl , her purse sufficiently full , moved off to the bar . A moment later , Two-Brew approached the buffet table and grabbed the hands of the bloated brunette and said , " Jesus Christ , Lydia , leave some for the guests . " He turned to the grey-bearded man then . " Chub , come on , ca n't you stop her ? " Chub stroked his grey beard and said he was sorry . Lydia said , " Stan , I do n't want to shock you but I am a guest , I 'm sure as shit not a wife . " Chub excused himself quietly , moved alone to a corner of the room , stared at a painting , then at his watch . Nine . He had been there half an hour . Half an hour more and he could leave . He could last half an hour more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chub stared up at the tall girl with the pale-blue eyes . " I do n't make a thing of stealing , but if you got cats , you do n't pass up free shrimp . " She got out a pack of English Ovals , gave Chub some matches . " Light me . " Chub did . " I 'm The Bone , who 're you ? " Chub said his name . " How come you 're here ? " Chub said how come . " Friends with the new head of the firm , huh ? " She spoke quickly , with a heavy Brooklyn accent . In the dark she would have sounded like Streisand . " You can do me some good  --  not now , this is n't a hustle  --  but I 'm into writing this great book and when it 's perfect , you could slip it to him . " She inhaled fiercely , drawing the smoke powerfully into her lungs , making an almost imperceptible " ssssss " as she dragged . " That 's how come I crashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you never know who you might meet , are you a literati ? " Chub gave his job title . " A researcher , no shit , I could use a researcher for this fantastic thing I 'm writing , how much you charge ? " Chub gave his rates . " Twenty-five ? For twenty-five an hour I can get someone to writep247it for me , go to hell with your twenty-five . " She got out another cigarette . He lit it for her , gave her back her matches , excused himself , went to the bar for a double Wild Turkey . At the bar the assistant publicist apologized for the fuss she 'd made about the stolen shrimp . Chub said not to worry . And she was n't , at least not about the shrimp ; it was his relationship with Two-Brew that caused her apology . She was frightened of that relationship because she did n't understand it , but she knew a bad word from Chub would n't do her cause much good . She had been seeing Kitchel for three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of publicity li ) rever . Two-Brew 's mother cornered him then , saying , in her southern accent , that was n't tonight simply wonderful and Chub said yes , absolutely wonderful , perfect and wonderful , and she was in the middle of saying that Stanley was going to be a great success , when she spotted her best friend , Helene , in a corner of the room , talking with her husband , so she turned abruptly , moving toward them , her best smile on , leaving Chub , who went off by himself and sat at a small table , sipping his drink and looking at his watch . Nineseventeen . Thirteen minutes to go . Anyone could survive thirteen minutes . " I get stuff backwards , " he heard behind him then as The Bone stood over him . " Mind if I park it a sec ? I just wan na explain . " Chub gestured toward an empty chair . " See , it 's a big problem , and I ca n't lick it always , the backwards thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to thank you for saying you were with me . Then I should have said you could go to hell with your twenty-five . See ? Backwards . Light me . " Chub did , and then she stood and moved away . At nine-thirty he shook Two-Brew 's hand . They looked at each other for a longer moment than probably either of them anticipated . Two-Brew resembled Itzhak Perlman now , only more trim . And his clothes were made by Huntsman . For a blink Chub was back , standing on a library ladder , when this apparition in a black and red lumberjack shirt and a bulging stomach came noisily through the Oberlin stacks , going , " Where is this Fuller fellow lurking ? Where is young Fuller ? "  | " Joy , " Chub said then , and left the party . " Some might think this a coincidence , " The Bone said , falling into step with him as he descended the staircase toward the cold December night . Chub kept on moving down . So did she . " Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight with ten biggies , five for the taxi uptown , five for the return . I knew this party was a freebee , and I wanted to see Gandhi , you know the new flick ? I was gon na sneak in there , too  --  the Ziegfeld 's easy  --  and I was halfway inside , what with all the crush and all , when this usher flagged me and got very hard-nosed about my method of entrance . So I was in a bind . I could have paid the five for the flick or bagged it and saved it for the taxi home , which would have been sensible . Except it was crucial that I see the goddamn flick  --  the reviews said that there was some great bloody stuff , battles , really good gore , y'know what I mean ? " For a moment Chub was tempted to interrupt and ask the difference between " good gore " and " bad gore " except probably she had an answer that he did n't want to hear so the moment passed . " Anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you can add  --  I mean subtract  --  you get the idea . Someone 's got to take me home and I thought why not give you a shot ? " Chub almost reached into his wallet to give her five , but he did n't . He looked at her . She was pretty enough , startling enough more accurately , to have any number of escorts . Why had she picked him ? This was a strange one , no question . This one had secrets . His curiosity was strong enough for a nod , and a few minutes later , they were sitting in a cab , heading downtown . Her apartment was like nothing else in Chub 's experience . It took up the first floor of what had once been a factory in SoHo , on Prince Street , not far from Dean and DeLuca . Part of the special quality came from the fact that it was , except for a small toilet , all one room , a room perhaps eighty feet long or longer , at least fifty feet wide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tall . There was a large , well-stocked kitchen spread along one wall , a dining area nearby . There was a king-sized bed , a vanity close to it that looked like something Joan Crawford would have used . ' Merep249was a seating area across the way , with an oversized television set , a Rctamax , a stack of movies . ( Hitchcock mostly , or titles that indicatedviolence . ) The Bone gave him a tour , accompanied by three cats that kept getting in the way . And there was such a pride , a fierce pride really , i n her tone . " Bought this with my first bread . Everybody said I was crazy but I plunked down the dough . Eight thou . Then twenty more fixing it up . Last month I was offered two hundred . I told them to stuff it . The only way I leave my home is in a box . " It was a remarkable place . Chub told her so . " Do n't say that , do n't say that , you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She indicated a long couch . Chub sat . The room was faintly lit ; he looked around , wondering what was coming . She moved to a far wall . " Close ' em . " Chub shut his eyes . There was a series of clicking sounds . " Have a look . " Chub stared around the room now , stunned , because on all the walls were giant photographs , six feet tall , some eight . Photos of magazine covers , Vogue and Mademoiselle and Bazaar and dozens more , all with the face of a younger Bone gazing out , each face styled differently . " Narcissus had nothing on me . " They were lovely and so was she ; Chub said that . The Bone smiled . " **41;13107;TOOLONG . ' " She crossed toward the kitchen . " What 're you drinking ? " Whatever she was . " How old are you , Fuller ? Forty ? " Chub gave his age . " Thirty-two ? You 're only a few years older than me . It 's that goddamn grey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She was pouring liquor when she said that , but she stopped . " There I go , backwards again . See , what I should have said first was that you certainly had a distinctive beard . Then I should have said that some men , handsome men especially , did n't need the added maturity a beard sometimes lent them . " She returned with two Scotches , bent down , kissed Chub suddenly , her tongue darting into his mouth . A moment later she stood , handed him his drink , sat on a chair facing him . " I hope you 're better in the sack than you were just then . " ( huh had known sex was coming before she said that , and thep250notion did n't thrill him . He had not touched a woman since the Pacific pounded outside the open terrace doors . Would he be able to perform ? It had not been a problem in the past , but probably it would now . The Bone gestured toward the giant photos on the walls . " Name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You want the me on Cosmo ? The face of Seventeen ? It 's a trick I do  --  whoever you want , I make myself up to look just like I did . I 'm great at makeup . " She shrugged . " ' Course , I ought to be after my years in the business . Evidence of a misspent youth . " She snapped her fingers then , lit another English Oval , inhaled deeply , the " ssssss " sound dominating the room . " Got it , " she said . " I bet behind that beard you 're one of those closet romantics Modern Brides . I even have the clothes . " She pointed to a stunning photograph of the magazine cover , the blue of her eyes never more dazzling , set off by the white wedding dress , the white lace shawl . " I 'll drive you into a frenzy . " She reached forward then to the coffee table and opened a box , held it out to Chub . " You into grass ? " Very . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for bed and I 'll take a joint and get ready for you , it takes awhile . " Chub did n't understand , but in a few minutes , as he lay naked and smoking in bed , he began to see . The Bone sat at her oversized vanity , a copy of the original magazine cover propped by her mirror . She took off all her chalk white makeup with cold cream , studied her face , then the photograph , then her face again , turning her head from side to side . When she finally began to work on her eyes Chub was reminded of a painter ; no , more a forger really , recreating something that once had been . " I was n't allowed makeup when I was growing up , " The Bone said . " My grandparents were some kind of crazy orthodox and they lived with us and convinced my folks it came from the Devil . " Where was this ? " Brooklyn  --  you notice how I sound like Streisand ?  --  we both went to Erasmus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On account of at the start people thought she was weird-looking but she made them see the truth . Well , I was weird-looking too . " Doubtful.  |p251She  looked at Chub a moment , went on with her work as she talked . " Listen , Fuller , when I was thirteen I was five eleven and a half , with the same magnificent lack of chest I have now , and the same habit of getting things backwards  --  my mother would n't let me cut my hair so it hung damn near to my fanny and no boy would come near me . The Wallflower of the Western World . In my room when I 'd stop crying long enough I could hear them downstairson the phone , trying to get someone to take me out . You must meet my granddaughter , **40;13150;TOOLONG . ' See , that was all they could find to brag about . I got so that I thought maybe my real name was **40;13192;TOOLONG . ' What got me through high school was that I knew I was going to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was taller than Wilt Chamberlain . So summer of junior year I worked at the local hospital and guess what : I hated nursing . I did n't realize mostly what you do was futz around all the time with old people . What a crusher . I read up on becoming a nun but that was dumb : I 'm a rotten Jew , how could I be a good Catholic ? So after I graduated I went to secretarial school in Brooklyn , knowing I was going to live the rest of my life upstairs and a spinster with everybody getting sadder and sadder because no man would come near me . And then guess what ? Danieli happened to me . " Who ? " Danieli . Danieli , for Chrissakes . The King . Bigger than Scavullo . " Who ? She had been working on recreating the style of her eyebrows . Now she put her utensils down and stared at Chub . " I thought you were a researcher . Scavullo only happens to take all the Cosmo covers . I never miss reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world  --  how the hell can you call yourself a researcher and not read Cosmo ? " Stoned , Chub smiled , promised to alter the errors of his ways . She shook her head , lit another English Oval , went back to studying her face . When she spoke again , it was quicker than even her usual cadence . Her secretarial school was on Fulton Street and so was Gage &; Milner , which was where Danieli liked to eat , and when he exited she was walking by and he followed her a few steps , caught tip , asked if she had ever considered modeling **27;13234;TOOLONG balding pate was shiny with almond oil . He wore a swathe of bleached linen wrapped around his body , one wide section of fabric drawn between his legs and looped through a girdle of knotted cord . He had no jewelry and brought no personal property , Amergin noticed . Sakkar 's misshapen shoulder was a disturbing disharmony . The broken bone had been allowed to heal in ignorance , rather than properly guided . But there was intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wary spirit peeped out of his eyes . The bard liked him on sight . " I hardly know what to do with you , " Amergin said , addressing Sakkar as if he were a houseguest instead of a possession . " Your AgeNorurged you on me as a shipwright , and though the idea is one to dream about , it is hardly practical for us . " His bardic commitment was to the truth ; must be to the truth , no matter how much his heart might dream otherwise . Amergin knew with certainty that AgeNor'sgift was an attempt at manipulation , for the Tyrian could not hide his nature from a druid 's eyes . Yet the temptation lay there all too fortuitously , burning inside him , challenging his will and his wisdom . Impractical . Not possible . Unforgettable . With a mighty effort he strove to push it aside . To Sakkar , he explained aloud , " You must understand that among my people , slavery is not the custom . Attendants serve the warrior class willingly in return for sharing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freemen , you see . " Sakkar did not see . He made no reply , just stared at the bard . " We occasionally take women captives after battle , of course , " Amergin went on , driven by the druidic necessity to teach , " but their situation is merely that of a loss of family status and we treat them well ; we keep them in our houses and raise their children as part of our tribe . Relationship and service among us are different from what you may have experienced elsewhere , and I do not want you to be uncomfortable . . . " Amergin broke off , aware of the Phoenician 's blank , uncomprehending expression . The man looked like an ox patiently expecting the yoke . Sakkar stood stiffly , with desperate dignity , trying to convince himself this might be better than the torture death awaiting him inevitablyhad he returned to Tyre . A loved woman 's dying moans . . . a dark alley . . . a rich man 's purse . . . escape on a doomed ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your talk , " he said haltingly . " Ai ! Of course , how thoughtless of me to go rattling on like an empty wagon , " Amergin apologized at once . " Words are my life , I will teach you . . . but not so many words as to make you a nuisance , " he added for his own benefit . He glanced around his house . " You 'll need a pallet . Caicher owes me a gift for a praise song I composed for his father 's father ; I 'll suggest that some soft calfskins and a pillow filled with feathers would please me . But what work can we find for you , Sakkar ? " The Phoenician waited . He had nothing else to do . Amergin returned to his composing . The great festival of summer 's dying drew near and he felt a growing urgency to complete his epic as the sun receded and the possibilities of the season diminished . Yet  --  and this was a question he sometimes asked himself in the still of the night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man slept on his new pallet  --  was the poem capable of completion ? Was the history of his tribe a finished saga , or did he have only the prelude to tell ? And sometimes he did not work on the poem at all , but lay in his bedbox dreaming of an island of meadows and forest , lakes and mountains ; a green dream of misty beauty he related only to Clarsah . The nights ran past . Soon the cattle raiders must return with their walking treasure , a fertile new cow or strong young bull for every clanholding . Their arrival would coincide with the lighting of the festival fires on hilltop and headland , marking the turn of the seasons . The warriors would surely come home in time for the dancing . Anticipating the festival dances made every Gaelician heart beat faster . First word of the returning warriors was carried by an excited horse herder who raced into the Mil 's stronghold , yelling , " They 're here , they 're home ! There 's a great cloud of dust coming this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world with him ! " His estimate was a Celtic exaggeration , but the herd was indeed enormous . It blanketed the roadway and overflowed across the fields , knocking down the small stone walls piled up by freemen to keep one man 's field of beans or kale separate from another 's . The herd trampled earth into sunbaked brick and drowned it beneath a sea of tossing horns and bawling voices , of animals briefly mounting onep202another in excitement , of men yelling and horses whinnying and motion , action , life . Wild with delight , the Gaelicians rushed to welcome their heroes home . " Eremon ! " Odba cried as she burst from her house , her sons at her heels . She ran across the compound and through the gate in the wall , shading her eyes with her hands so she could pick Eremon out of the approaching crowd . But she did not see him . Chariot warriors and horse riders flowed around her , calling to their families and trying to offer boasts to somehow exceed the awesomeherd behind them . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locate Eremon anywhere amid the dust and the noise and the seething panorama of livestock . Donn drove up , hollow-eyed and disheveled , his horses sharphippedfrom the journey . " Where is my husband ? " Odba demanded to know . " I thought he would be leading you . " Donn glanced back the way he had come . " I do n't see him right now , " he said vaguely . " But he 'll be along ... Ai , there 's Dil ! Look , wife , come see what I brought you ! " Odba noticed then that the heads of enemies slain in battle hung from the rim of Donn 's chariot ; trophies not usually taken in a mere cattle raid . " Preserve these for me in cedar oil , " Donn ordered Dil . " They will make a display to impressmy sons ' sons , someday . " Having said this , Donn beamed happily down at the female childrenclustering around his chariot , and the whole family swept away together , leaving Odba on the road , husbandless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halted his chariotOdba could see that it was all but filled with the doubled-up form of an injured calf , bedded on Eber 's best cloak . He eased out of the chariot and lifted the little animal with a gentle solicitude no battlefieldopponent would have recognized in the man . Eber carefully straightened the knobbly legs and guided the calf forward until he caught the eye of a healer , whom he hastily summoned . " Take care of this little beast , " he ordered . " It was badly torn iii an accident and has lost much blood , but been very brave . " Ile dropped a stroking hand on the calf 's forehead and the shape of his mouth was sweet and soft as a woman 's . Eremon 's wife , watching , burned with envy of that calf , recipientof the kindness that lay interlocked with courage in Celtic hearts . Eremon is n't coming hack to me , Odba thought . I have finallyp203driven him away and he stayed in the land of the Astures . Or he stopped at the clanholding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't tell me . Those men hold together like twigs in a duck 's nest . Or he 's dead , she thought last , hardly daring allow herself the thought at all . There are limits to pain , and she could not accept the permanent loss of Eremon , for all her temporary anger . Her boys tugged at her . " Where is he , where is our father ? " " We 'll find him , " she promised them , setting her mouth in a grim line . She began shoving her way against the tide of cheering , excited people , the women laughing and crying , the children yelling , the old ones babbling of their own days of adventure . And then she saw Eremon leading his chariot team , both of whom were limping slightly . He was accompanied by a small herd of wavymanedhorses guarded by several foot warriors , and he was alive . He had come home ! " Look , just look ! " cried Moomneh , running past her , not to greet Eremon but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dapple grays and mares like polished onyx , with long rippling manes covering their necks and shoulders in waves of glossy silk . Moomneh , his heart in his eyes , called only the most casual word of greeting to his father before he laid hands on the nearest mare and began crooningto her . Odba experienced an unusual attack of shyness . Eremon looked tired and there were dark circles under his eyes . When he saw her , he nodded but did not come toward her . She forced herself to go to him , step by step , feeling humiliated at having to do it all . They both wondered what she would say . " You look as if you 've been to a war , " she remarked at last . " I have . " Proudly . His voice was very hoarse and roughened , deeper than she remembered . " We charged in our full strength and they met us head to head . We fought from sunrise to sunset , and drank wine with the survivors that night . We claimed their herd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't understand ... " " We fought honorably in the daylight and we won , woman ! Is your skull too thick to understand that ? We won everything . The pride of the Gaclicians is increased by ten tens , and it was my doing , Odha . Mine ! " She fell hack before the flame in his eyes.  |p204Like  a cupbearer , she followed in his wake as he made his way to the stronghold on the headland . Eremon 's sons capered around his chariot , begging for rides . " Let me just stand in it and hold the reins ! " Moomneh pleaded . " Iknow I could drive your horses if I had the reins in my hands . " " My horses lamed themselves on the rocks , " Eremon cautioned . " If I let you drive , you must stay at the walk . " The boy agreed with breathless excitement . Eremon followed him into the chariot and stood behind him as Moomneh triumphantly guided the war cart home . A warrior 's son , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms folded , radiating pride . The night was given to feasting , and the heroes stayed in the hall until dawn . Their women went to empty beds and did not complain ; even Odba did not complain . The next day , the druid measurers accompanied the clan-chiefs on their inspection of the herd . Milesios walked heavily , keeping Eremon beside him , and when no one was looking he leaned on his son 's shoulder . " So many cattle , " the Mil said rather vaguely , gazing at the sea of animals , some of whom were already bawling their discontent . Insteadof lush mountain meadowland they could find only dry saltgrassand yellow furze to eat , and they pawed the earth and looked around in bewilderment . Their captors did not notice ; they were too busy congratulating themselves and arguing over who would get what . " I claim all the white cows ! " Eber Finn cried , ready for an argument . " White cows are beloved of the Mother and you already have enough of her favor , " Etan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubled . " Mine should be the first choosing because this was my victory , " Eremon croaked , trying to make his ruined voice rise above the generalnoise . Colptha the sacrificer stood to one side , listening . He heard the unending rivalry , felt the pull and tug this way and that , sensed the fault lines where a solid mass could be split asunder . Dissension between his brothers gave him pleasure . The more petty their behavior , the more noble he seemed in his own eyes . They could not gang up against him when they were at war with each other . Colptha walked among the warriors , saying softly , " You are right , Eremon , you should have the pick of the herd . "  |p205And  , elsewhere , " Eber , you deserve the choice cattle and the best breeding stock , for there is no doubt you have a gift with animals . " He did not , however , say anything to Ir . Ir was a dry pine log capable of exploding dangerously , and better left alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stand up for yourself and claim what you want , Donn . " " Take the best breeding animals , Eber . " The squabbling provided a morning 's entertainment . Amergin brought Clarsah , safe from dust in her leather satchel , to the new herd . The voices of the cattle could penetrate leather , could sink into the wooden frame and brass strings and come out again at some futuretime when the bard sang the song of this victory , the praise song of its heroes . Standing on the perimeter of the herd , Amergin looked to the east and thought with envy of the sights the warriors must have seen on their journey . Then he looked north , toward the ninth wave , and felt that same irresistible impulse that had once led his ancestors out of the forests and riverlands of Gaul . It is time to move on , a voice whispered to him , surprising him . Perhaps it came from the harp in the pungent darkness of her leather case . Perhaps it came from the wind , blowing across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere , he thought . Eremon and his warriors have made us cattle lords again ; we will be greatly respectedby the other tribes and the celsine will court our favor in returnfor calves and oxen . Even Milesios has forgotten that his son declared a war without his permission , and joins in the praise being lavished upon Eremon . The hard times are over for now . Are they ? whispered the wind from the sea . Amergin went back to his house and his composing . Meanwhile , Eremon was explaining  --  for the seventh or eighth time , and enlarging the tale with each telling  --  how he had won the Asturian cattle . Milesios had wearied and gone to seek the cool shadowsof the Heroes ' Hall , but an admiring crowd still surrounded the warrior , urging him on . " We took most of their best cattle and horses , " Eremon said , " but we left them a few breeding animals . Heroes do not crush honorable opponents . And I gave them something in return : my word in the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack there again . That will give them adequate time to restore their herds and they accepted the arrangement as a fair treaty . We partedp206friends . " He grinned . " We can almost count the Asturians as allies now , in fact , " he added , knowing full well that new tribal alliances were usually credited to the chieftain . But this alliance was Eremon 's alone , an earnest against the day when he would sit on the bronzesheathedbench in the Heroes ' Hall . He wished Taya were there to hear him . Looking around , he saw many female faces among the admiring crowd , but no sign of the dark-haired woman with the level eyebrows . He began asking questions , and he did not like the answers he was given . When Amergin reached his house he found Sakkar lounging on the fasting-bench , letting the sun 's heat comfort his aching shoulder . The bard gave him a long and thoughtful look . " Is it true you can build an entire ship ? " he asked at last . Sakkar 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he explained . " But I could tell how . Ship for ocean-river , go anywhere . " Under Amergin 's tutelage , his Gaelician vocabulary was improving . " You want ship ? Be trader ? " The bard 's lips smiled but his eyes did not . " No . . . I just wondered if it was really possible . " He sat down companionably beside Sakkar and took Clarsah from her case . The Phoenician eyed the harp with interest . It vaguely resembled the portable lyres used in his homeland , but was finer and more skillfullymade than any musical instrument he had ever seen . There were so many strings , gleaming like gold , and so many curves and carvings , giving the harp a form akin to that of a living creature . And though Sakkar did not yet understand many Gaelician words , he understood the harp perfectly . He closed his eyes in contentment he had never expected to feel again and braced his back against the sun-warmed granite wall of the bard 's house . A shadow fell across the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and Clarsah had been together and saw Eremon standing over him , wearing a most truculent expression . " Where is Taya ? " the warrior demanded to know . " She stays in her own clanholding now , " Amergin replied . " I have heard people speak of you and her in one breath ; did you quarrel with her ? Did you drive her away ? " " Of course not , Erernon ! Who could quarrel with Taya ? As soon shake a spear at the rain . " Aiii rgin would not mention Odba . Eremon would find out for himself , and soon enough.  | " I expected her to be here to welcome me when I returned , " Eremon said . " Is she being hidden away from me ? " " Did you think she was for your private use ? " Amergin retorted , trying to hold on to his rising temper . " Scotta has never shared the bed of another man , " Eremon remindedhis brother , " and thus she honors Milesios above all other men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Odba is the only woman you have any claim to . " " Odba ? " Eremon looked as if he had forgotten the name . " She is your one wife . " " I mean to correct that as soon as possible . I have let her get away with her nonsense far too long . A spoiled woman is worse than a spoiled horse ; she wo n't pull her weight at all . I think Lugaid 's daughter will suit me much better . " " Do n't be in such a hurry about it , " Amergin advised him . The warrior 's eyebrows shot up . " Why ? Do you tardily intend to make an offer for her ? I warn you , it wo n't do any good . She was mine before I left , and she is much more mine now . No woman can resist a hero , bard ! " Riding high on the crest of confidence , Eremon turned his back on Amergin and strode away toward the Heroes ' Hall . As he walked , he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way she listened to him , silently and with shining eyes , as if his words were the most important things in the world . Her admiration was so obvious that the need to boast had melted away and he found himself telling her things he had never told anyone before , things about himself even he had not realized until he tried to articulate them for Taya . Old wounds dating back to his early childhoodwere exposed , soothed , and laid to rest . The desperate bravado of his youth was transformed into heroic valor ; the rough camaraderiehe enjoyed with his fellow warriors made Taya smile instead of frown , as Odba did . " How fortunate you are to have so many good friends , " she had said . " My wife resents them . " " She does ? Why ? I think it 's important for a man to have friends  --  I know I hate being alone . I 'm glad you 're the sort of person who needs people , Eremon . " She had smiled at him and he felt like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ' : rennin entered the Heroes ' hall with a full wind in his sails . " Though it hurt his throat to speak loudly , he announced , " I have de/tided to have a second wife , now that our clanhold contains so many fine animals . Where are Itos and Lugaid ? I have gifts to offer them for " His mother 's hand closed tightly on his arm . " No , Eremon , " Scotta said . He looked at her in astonishment . " What do you mean , no ? " " I mean you are not to ask for Taya as a wife . There is bad air betweenher and Odba , and Odba has made a number of threats . Itos keeps Taya in his clanhold now to avoid any more trouble , and I ask you to help me preserve harmony in the tribe by forgetting about her . Perhaps some day next season , when Odba 's head has cooled , you can find someone she will accept ... " " No ! " Eremon jerked away from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in front of the chieftain 's bench . The Mil jerked upright to stare at his son , who was red-faced and obviously angry . " What 's this all about , Milesios ? " Eremon rasped . " You explainit to me ! The Mil blinked and looked toward his wife . " Scotta . . . ? Is there some problem ... ? " She hurried to stand beside him . " I did n't bother you with it because you were busy with so many other matters , " she said in a loud voice for public consumption . " This is a little thing , really ; a quarrel between women . " " It is not a little thing to me ! " Eremon shouted . Eremon 's anger battered Milesios , making him feel very tired . " Explain what this is about , wife , " he said wearily . In a measured voice that allowed itself no partisanship , Scotta told of Odba 's complaints . Eremon neglected her , she had not conceived for seasons , and Eremon had recently shown interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank than her own . If Eremon did not forget Taya and return to her Odba would sue for a huge eric , and if Eremon insisted on bringing Taya into his house anyway , Odba would take her children and her personal property  --  including all those sheep  --  back to the Artabrians . Eremon 's face turned crimson . " She ca n't do that ! " he bellowed , shredding his damaged voice . " Is there a brehon in the hall ? " Scotta inquired . Findbar , senior judge in the order of druids , stepped forward . " My knowledge is yours to command , " he said formally . " Tell my son the Law in this - natter . " Findbar spoke directly to Ereruiim . " If your wife leaves you of herp209own choice , or if you set her aside for any reason other than a failure of mothering , she can take her children with her . None of them is yet trained to bear arms ; they are still mother-age . " " But they belong with me , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what man can be certain he is the sire ? We can be sure of motherhood , however , and for that reason the Law supports the woman in these situations . Her connection to the child was witnessedat birth and is unmistakable . As for the eric , if Odba conceives no more children and can prove to us that you turn from her to Lugaid'sdaughter ... " " Bed Odba at once , and often , " one of the gathering crowd suggestedwith a bawdy laugh . " I want nothing further to do with a woman so mean-spirited she attacks me behind my back like this , running and crying to Scotta ! " " Can you accuse her of being a poor mother ? " Findbar 's calm voice inquired . Eremon hesitated . But his Celtic tongue would not frame an untruth ; dishonor would be even worse than giving Odba the credit she had earned . " No , " he said reluctantly . " She bears healthy children and takes good care of them . But that does not make her a satisfactorywife to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you mean you do n't care if you cost Taya 's clan half those wonderful new cattle they 're all so excited about ? Or our clan the use of a herd of fine sheep ? Or me the sight of my grandsons ? Are your own desires more important to you than the tribe ? " " You women stick together to thwart me , " Eremon complained . " Milesios , have you no say in this ? Will you let your wife do all your talking ? " The Mil 's eyes brightened dangerously . " I will not embrace Odba again and none of you can force me to do it ! " Eremon cried , letting his anger gallop out of control . Milesios got to his feet and glared at his son with a remnant of his famed ferocity . " I am ashamed of your words , " he said . " I forbid you to cost my uncle 's clan an eric , or to drive Odba away . I will not have it said that Milesios can no longer hold his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fists and waved them in the air , seeking something to strike . " But ... ! " " I have told you how it is to be ! " Milesios commanded with all a chieftain 's authority . " Let us hear no more about this ! " 1. : renum shook his head In nil side to side like a baffled bear . For thep210first time in his life , he found himself in a situation with no foreseeablevictory . Coming like a counterpunch after his triumph , frustrationshocked him . " I have promised myself I would have Taya as a wife , " he said in a choking voice , turning his head so Milesios did not hear him . " I will find a way ... "  |p211THE  MIL 'S ELDEST SON was whistling to himself as he supervisedthe construction of a wattle fence for protecting the clan 's new Asturian horses  --  the pick of which was still hotly contested between Eremon and Eber Finn . Donn had no great desire for the animals himself , but he was routinely called upon for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as everyone knew . Now he directed the freemen doing the actual labor with sharp eyes that missed no smallest detail . Donn might have been a fine craftsman if he had not been born into the warrior class . The wattle pens were built in sections the length of a tall man , with axe and billhook used for cutting the upright staves and an iron mallet and spike for setting the holes . Flexible branches , split and shaped with an adze , were woven among the uprights to form a sturdy panel that was then bound to other panels until a wall of the desired length was produced . Some stockmen put their fences togethercarelessly , seduced by the ease of manufacture into thinking the task was an unimportant one , easily redone if the fence did not hold . But that was not Donn 's style . By alternately bullying and cajoling the freemen , he was building a pen smoother than the walls of a noble 's house , so carefully woven that no loose ends stuck out to rip a lock of wavy mane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Donn suspected that life was , in total , unmanageable , but he believed it could be controlled in small segments , if one took everythingstep by step . A neat straight fence was control . Speaking slowly so that others must wait for your words was control . Ile did not really long for the acclaim Erern6n enjoyed as a leader of warriors , though he was jealous of his standing as favorite son of the Mil . I ) onn 's inmost ambitions reached no further than a cheerful ,  |p212tidy  existence with a cheerful , tidy woman and a houseful of children . Some sons at last , if the spirits were willing . Donn did not lust for larger challenges . Colptha found him just then , standing to one side and quietly enjoying the perfection of his pen . " Donn , I have something to tell you right now , " the sacrificer said . Colptha always contrived to sound urgent , as if the rising of the sun depended upon his words . " Wait a moment , will you ? I think I better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will hold up against crowding horses . " " Forget the pen ; your people need you . " Donn stopped short and stared at him . " Me ? " " Eremon behaved very badly just now in the Heroes ' Hall ; he showed Milesios that he may not be longheaded enough to become chieftain one day . There are those of us who have already suspected this ; I feel safe in admitting as much to you , now . In spite of this recentshowy venture of Erembn 's , I tell you the time will come when the tribe looks elsewhere for a leader . I just want you to know that I believe the bronze bench should rightly go to the chieftain 's eldest son , Donn . You have long been denied the respect that should be yours , while louder men claimed all the glory . No chief of a lesser clan should lead the tribe  --  nor Eremon , either . I will support you for that honor when the time comes , my brother . " Donn was staring at him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obviouslytaken aback . " Your Dil would be very pleased , would she not ? And all those daughters of yours  --  think how hotly they would be sought as wives . It is every man 's ambition to marry a chieftain 's daughter . " Donn stood squarely , feet planted on solid earth , and thought his way step by step along the path Colptha was leading him . " I have never dreamed of chiefdom , " he said uncertainly . " Heed my words , Donn , " the sacrificer said . " I was given a great gift that has been neither recognized nor appreciated because the rest of the tribe is as shortsighted as Eremon . You are the only one of my brothers to respect my wisdom ; you are the only one capable of making that wisdom available to all the tribe in the future . We could do so much together , you and I. Allies as well as brothers . Allies ... " Colptha 's head moved rhythmically from side to side ; his words became a deliberate chant . Eremon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked away . But Donn , who did not like to hep213rude , watched . As Conmael had watched , allowing Colptha to perfecthis technique . " If you became chieftain , you will remember that I was your first supporter . Your brother , your friend . Brothers and friends help each other , Donn . I help you , you help me , that is a balance , and the spiritsalways demand balance . " He held Donn 's eyes with an intense , fixed gaze . Donn found himself nodding in agreement . " Yes ... a balance . " " Very good . Remember , I help you and you help me , " the sacrificerrepeated . " You will remember . You will remember . " " I will remember , " Donn murmured . Colptha returned to his house and Conmael , walking with the elastic gait of a man buoyed by his own cleverness . The wheel of the seasons was turning ; Milesios was obviously fadingand must soon die . In time Trial would also undertake his transition , and a new chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respected , admired , listened to without question . Unlike Milesios , Irial would name his own successor ; there would be no election . The spirits always spoke unequivocally through the chief druid . When the Mil was dead , Donn could replace him if the right pressures were skillfully applied . Donn , the most malleable of Colptha 's brothers and the one least capable of resisting him . Irial 's wiry health assured Colptha of enough seasons to win his way back into the chief druid 's good graces before Irial himself made his transition , and when the time was right , Colptha would call in his debt . When Irial felt death approaching and prepared to name his successor , Colptha would send Donn , chief of the tribe , to him . Irial , for all his arrogance , was not above political pressure , Colptha felt sure . He had his weak spots , every man did . There were dark stains on every spirit and rotten places in every heart . Colptha knew . He would find them , and he and Donn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irial 's successor . " For the good of the tribe , " the sacrificer whispered to himself , almostbelieving it. to , The time of festival arrived . Great fires were ignited at sunset all up and down the coast and on the high ground inland , sending a signal from clanhold to clanhold . It was time for the gathering of the clans.  |p214The  lighting of the great fires , which announced festival or attack or the inauguration of a chieftain , was always a thrilling occasion , whatever its cause . The moment when the torch was put to the carefullyconstructed timber pyre was pure magic , and the gasp of the spectators when the next fire down the coast blazed in response was an expression of sheer exultation . Amergin , observing , mused on the power man had acquired over space . By building a signal fire he had brought a faraway point nearer , expanded his own horizon , extended his reach . Looking from blaze to blaze , a man could encompass formidable distances in a seriesof instantaneous visual strides . Space and time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only three signal fires distant . At sunrise the Gaelicians gathered to take part in the ceremonies marking the death and birth of the seasons . And when the more seriousrituals were over , they turned their faces to the sun and danced . The dancing was the affirmation of life , when tall men and lusty women moved together to the primitive surge of their blood , telling with graceful hands and quick feet and flashing eyes the ancient stories of love and war and pastoral life . To the beat of the drums and the wailing of the pipes they celebrated the fertile marriage of earth and sun . The dancing men took the initiative while the women at first kept their eyes lowered , watching their partners ' feet  --  though those demurelyhidden female eyes danced with mirth . The men set the figuresand the women followed , circling among a multiplicity of patterns without breaking the all-important rhythm that controlled life . Every large family had its particular dance demonstrating some favoriteepisode from their history . On festival days a bard might recite the story while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shouted approval of other families , who were waiting their own time as the center of attention . There was the Dance of Wheels and the Dance of Ribbons , the Arch Dance and the magnificent and dangerousDance of Swords , the presentation of the Mil 's own family . Iron swords , honed for the occasion , flashed in the hot sun as muscular bodies pressed against their rounded points and flirted along their sharpened cutting edges . " Olaha ! Olaha ! " the spectators cried in admiration . Dancing was life . And if the famed Celtic moodiness came upon them , if thep215weather was bad or the fisher tribes had small catches , if the meat was maggoted and the grape harvest meager  --  then , too , the peoplecame together and danced . And somehow , by the time the sun sank like a yellow cheese into the western sea to mark the birth of a new day according to tradition , everyone felt better . Sakkar came to watch the dancing . Age-Nor , busy with preparations for departure , did not . The Tyrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just offered a sacrifice of a white bullock in thanksgivingfor the unprecedented success of his recent venture . Colptha had watched with jealous eyes as another sacrificer asked the animal'sacquiescence , then cut its throat and chanted the invocations . Almost immediately the drums signaled the start of the dancing . Dil wore a red sash for the occasion and teased her husband Donn about his serious expression . Eber 's women came in a group , chatteringhappily among themselves , complimenting each other on their appearance . Scotta moved with a powerful , stamping rhythm , tossingher head . Ir ignored the traditional patterns , following music no one else heard . The chief bard stood in a place of honor with Clarsah slung from his shoulder . The women crowded around him . " Join us , Amergin ! " " Come , shape the pattern with me . " " Ai , Amergin , the dance will not be complete without you . " They tugged and pleaded and at last he bowed his dark head and stepped forward . An eager citharadagh held out his hands for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one look from the bard . When Amergin joined the Dance of the Swords the spectators held their breaths to watch him . Long , lean-hipped , graceful as flame , he scorched them with the passion of his dancing . In the heat of the day he had laid his tunic aside , stripping to the brief kilt preferred in summer weather . The warriors boasted their fearlessness against the sharpened edges , but it was the bard who threw himself among the swords most recklessly . His sweat-polished torso bowed over the blades as if he meant to cut himself in two . A sword spun in his grasp and raked along his body ; he flung himself into the air in flawless imitation of a man receiving a fatal slashing and then whipped back to represent the victor , brandishing the weapon triumphantly , stamping his feet in exultation . waiting their turn to dance . Though she avoided any contact with the clan of Milcsios , no onep216expected her to deny herself participation in the festivals and the rituals . To do so would isolate her from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall of her clanspeople , trying to catch a glimpse of Eremon . But when she saw Amergin dancing , she stared like all the others . Who could think of anyone else while Amergin gathered all the passion of his race into his body and flung it back for everyone to see ? When the dance ended , Amergin reclaimed Clarsah and made his way to a trestle table where basins of water for hot faces waited besideeven more welcome wine . Scena Dullsaine threaded her way through the crowd and appeared at the bard 's elbow . " Here , Amergin , let me wipe the sweat from your eyes , " she said , offering him a folded cloth and a dazzling smile . Other women were thronging around him too , their bodies pressing against his , warming themselves with his heat . Scena warned them away with a glare , but these were Gaelician women , not easily intimidated . One stamped her feet ; another favoredScena with a long-lidded look bordering on defiance . " We have been expecting to see you again in our clanhold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stray breeze blew in from the sea to the north , gently blottingthe moisture from his forehead . A scent of green wind curled around him . " Expecting me ? " he said to Scena in a distracted fashion . " What for ? " She drew in her breath sharply . " I do n't remember , " she answered in her frostiest voice . Turning sharply , she stalked through the crowd in search of the first interested eyes , the first available and receptive man . The sun , and the blood of Scena Dullsaine , were hot . Amergin looked after her for a moment in genuine bafflement , then regretted too late the words she had mistaken as insult . The tangle of women seemed oppressive to him . As gracefully as he could he separated himself from them , protesting that he needed to go off someplace and prepare himself to recite later at the bardic competition . As soon as he was out of reach of the women he felt some part of his being yearning back toward them . Yearning for completion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Family , friends , work . . . he took Clarsah from his shoulder and carried her in front of him almost like a shield , holding on to the one thing he had.  |p217A  small stand of wind-warped pines clustered together at the edge of the festival ground . The druid in Amergin headed for trees , as so often before . He was halfway there when he caught sight of Taya drifting in the same direction , glancing back over her shoulder occasionallyas if in wistful hope of seeing one certain face . " Taya ? " " Amergin ! You startled me . " Her cheeks were rosy . " I was hoping ... " " To see Eremon , " he finished for her . She dropped her eyes . " To see Eremon without Odba . I was watching him during the dancing , but then I lost sight of him in the crowd and I do n't know where he 's gone . " " I think he went with Caicher and Brego to limber his muscles for the spear-casting competition . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amergin had to offer what comfort he could . " Come and sit with me in the shade while I tune my harp , " he suggested . " It would be better for both of you if you and Eremon do n't meet here . " The floor of the pine grove was carpeted with needles . The two Gaelicians made comfortable seats for themselves , backs propped against tree trunks . Amergin glanced at Taya out of the corner of his eye . She seemed almost frail compared to the opulence of Scena Dullsaine , and now that her brief blush had faded he saw how very pale she was . Skin normally milk-white was almost bluish , as if too much water had been added . " Are you well ? " he could n't help asking her as he took the harp from its case . Taya shrugged . " Well enough . I eat . I work . I salt meat and bake bread and card wool , I sandscrub cauldrons and help care for other women 's children . And ... how is Eremon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I thought he would try to see me since he got back , but he has n't . " " Do you want him to ? " " Yes . No . I do n't know . All of you are right , it would only make trouble . " With her fingernails , Taya clawed an amber bead of resin from the trunk of the pine tree . The sticky substance formed a ball as she rolled it between her fingers and she frowned down into it , looking for answers . But Taya was not a druid diviner ; the tree had no messages for her . " What am I to do , Amergin ? " she wondered aloud . " I feel like I'inp218just hanging on a peg , waiting , and I 'm not even certain what I 'm waiting for . " The bard barked a short laugh without humor . " I understand exactly what you mean . " Taya dropped her resin ball and gave him a searching look . " It 's possible to be discontented though you have strong walls around you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked him . " And it 's even possible to feel lonely in the heart of a crowd . " Scena Dullsaine would never have made such a perceptive remark , Amergin suddenly realized . She would never come out of herself that far . And the Taya he had seen as a child would not have said such things , either . When had she shapechanged from a tagalong girl into a wise woman ? " It is n't my nature to push myself forward , Amergin , " Taya went on . " I always preferred for someone else to be the center of attention . I am a born audience , I suppose , which is why I always sought you out  --  before the sun rose in my sky and I recognized it as Eremon . " Even in quiet Taya the Celtic gift for poetry bloomed , like violets in deep shade . Amergin felt a rush of tenderness toward her . Her simple revealing of herself was a precious gift of trust . Looking down into her round and wistful face , Amergin found himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman before . Within her undeniably female body he recognized a friend beyond gender or guile , a friend who became from that moment infinitely dear to him . " Eremon is a lucky man , " he said . The sharp eyes of Colptha the sacrificer had seen Taya walk with the bard toward the pine grove . He ran his tongue over his thin lips , sensing another opportunity for demonstrating Eremon 's excessive rashness to the tribe . To all the assembled tribe . He hurried to the site of the spear-casting competition and tugged impatiently at Eremon 's arm , ruining his shot . The warrior spun around with a cocked fist to hit him , only barely restraining himself in time . What living man would strike a druid ? " Get out of here , sacrificer , " he warned through gritted teeth . " You look hot , brother , " Colptha responded as if the warning meant nothing . " You should seek shade  --  in that pine grove over there , for instance ; the one where Amergin has taken Taya . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . " What are you trying to do ? " " Look out for your welfare , nothing more . You appear to be overheated , Eremon . " The warrior was indeed overheated . He crossed the distance to the pine grove in bounding strides , and Colptha watched him go , smiling . Eremon needed to learn how it felt to lose to someone else ; he had won too much too easily . In their youth Colptha had suffered too many humiliating defeats at Eremon 's hands . The warrior burst into the pine grove like a runaway bull . " What are you doing here with Taya ? " he demanded of Amergin . " Tuning my harp , " Amergin replied . " Tuning my woman ! " " She is my friend , " Amergin said , savoring the term . " We were talking together . " " A woman can be your friend when she fights at your side in battle , " Eremon told him , " but on soft pine needles she 's something very different . Get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up slowly , unfolding his lanky length until he could look straight into Eremon 's eyes . " I go where I want , when I want , and on no man 's orders , " he said in a measured voice . " If one of us must leave here , it will have to be you , since I claimed this spot first . And Taya is a free woman , she can stay with whomever she chooses . " Eremon 's eyes sparkled with blue flames . He doubled his huge fists and swelled his chest , but Amergin did not move back by a hair 's thickness . Indeed , he seemed almost to lean forward , ready and able to land a blow that would rock Eremon onto his heels . Taya , staring at them both with the secret thrill of a woman who sees men fighting over her , thought to herself with surprise , The bard is more man than the warrior ! And then her clear , practical woman 's mind told her , And I am enough for Eremon , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put one small hand on the warrior 's brawny chest . " I will go with you wherever you wish , Eremon , " she said contentedly. krenrbn flashed his brother a look of triumph before he took Taya 's hand and guided her away . Colptha in the distance , watching , marked the direction they took and then went looking for Odha . The most deserted part of the clarihuld that latesununer day wasp220the chariot shed , where the war carts of the Mil and his sons were stored beneath the golden gloom of a thatched roof . The painted leather coverings and curving grace of the wickerwork designs glowed through the shadows . There must be beauty to offset the brutalityof the sword : art and style to balance the pain and the screaming . Eremon saw only Taya 's loveliness , however , a charm doubly desirableto him since he thought he had just wrested it from one of his own brothers . Taya could feel jealousy fueling his fires , but womanly wisdom prevented her telling him how unnecessary that jealousy was ; how totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the delight of his desire as he flattered and fondled her , murmuring into her hair , pulling her clothing aside , making her feel more beautifulthan any woman could possibly be .. . An outraged shriek knifed through the heated air . Holding Taya tightly against him , Eremon rolled over and halfroseto face Odba , who advanced upon them white-faced and furious . " I was told you were here together but I did n't want to believe it ! " Odba cried . Taya burrowed into Erembn 's chest . With unusual tenderness , the warrior cupped her head protectively with one big hand as he scowled at his wife , meeting assault with assault . " What are you doing here ? And who are you , to shout at me ? " " I 'm defending my territory ! " Tucked safely in Eremon 's arms , Taya began to feel almost audacious , catching bravado from the hot flesh pressed against her own . " You 're defending this whole row of chariots against big savage me , Odba ? " she laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " the other woman threatened , advancing upon her . But whatever Odba intended was never completed , for the voice of the Mil thundered through the chariot shed . " I thought I had put an end to this ! Why does the problem keep coming back to disturb me like undigested shellfish ? " The trio turned to face him . Milesios stood with Scotta at his side and a crowd at his back , alerted and excited by Colptha 's casual mention of " a terrible fight between Odba and Taya in the chariot shed . " Colptha had given the pot just enough time to come to the simmer ; now it was boiling , and there would be many witnesses . Lugaid shoved through to M ilesios . " Your son hired my ( laughterp221in here , " he claimed . " My family should not have to pay for trouble he causes ! " He did not like bringing such a charge against his good friend and recent leader , but Odba 's threatened eric was very much on his mind . Eremon pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for everything , I tell you . If she is barren , it is because she has such an unpleasantnature I can no longer stand to be with her . Even when I embrace her she buzzes constantly in my ear , complaining , finding fault , telling me how much better she was treated among the Artabrians . Odba herself has driven me away from her to Taya , who is a woman grown and has a right to accept any man she chooses . " Milesios shook his head at his son . " Why all this fuss over a woman , Eremon ? I would have expected it of Eber Finn , perhaps , but not of you . " There was not enough room in the shed for both the chariots and the principals in the argument , much less for all the eager spectators . Somehow the people swirled outside and the crowd grew still larger as old Itos came forward , walking with the caution of a brittleboned whitebeard . He addressed Milesios as the head of one clan to another . " Mindful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep Lugaid 's daughteraway from your son Eremon . We have behaved with honor . Is Eremon now trying to force a situation whereby your clan takes away all our new cattle after supposedly helping us win them ? Such unheard-of treachery is sufficient reason for clan-war , Milesios ! " The summer air frosted . Clan-war . A man did not say those words lightly . The tearing asunder of clan-war could lead to the disintegrationof a whole tribe , weakening it beyond repair and laying it open to conquest by outsiders . Better flood , better famine , than the war of clan against clan . Long after , Eremon would think to ask , " Where did Itos and Lugaidget such terrible ideas about me ? Have I not always been the most honorable of men ? What could possibly have suggested such treachery to them ? " But too much time had passed before he asked that question , and no one could tell him the answer . Scotta , standing at her husband 's shoulder throughout the confrontation , was invoking the spirits in desperate silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , she whispered inwardly . Please ! The Mil lifted his grizzled head and gazed at Itos with the implacabilityof ten generations of warriors in his eyes ; the authority of tenp222generations of nobles in his bearing . " There will be no clan-war , " he said . His voice was granite . " Findbar , step forward and hear me , that my words may be witnessed by a brehon . Odba will have no further cause to threaten the clan of Itos with an eric , because as long as he lives in my clanhold , Eremon will never put his hands on the woman Taya again . I pledge my own honor price on it , the full value of the chieftain of the Gaelicians . " Thank you , Scotta whispered in gratitude to the silent ones who alwaysheard . Eremon was stunned . The full weight of the Law and his own sire 's honor had been invoked against him . Rather than surrender a chieftain'shonor price , which would totally impoverish them , his clan would form a fence of living bodies if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prestige of his entire family was pledged against him . " Scotta ! " Eremon cried out as a man cries his mother 's name when there are no other answers . The wife of the Mil stood straight and tall . " I would cut you down with my own sword if you tried to dishonor the word of Milesios , or to set yourself against the Law that protects us all . How can I teach my children to respect the Law if I do not uphold it myself ? " There was a startled silence . No one present could remember hearing a woman threaten to destroy her own child in such a fashion . Eremon gritted his teeth , swallowing pain . His arms slowly fell away from Taya . His face slowly turned towardOdba . " Come , wife , " Eremon said huskily . " Let us go back to the festival . " Odba had dressed that morning in her very best robes and arrangedher hair in yet another clever style . She had perfumed her skin with the last drops of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made herself as beautiful as possible , but Eremon was looking through her as if she had ceased to exist . A woman in the crowd remarked , " If I were Odba , I would just take my pleasure with another man . The Law allows a woman that if her husband does n't satisfy her . " Dil responded , " Scotta accepts no man but Milesios , and her sons constantly extol her to their wives as a model of female perfection . So we have adopted the custom as well . I suspect Erernon would never forgive Odba if she attempted to do otherwise . " " Look at his face . I do n't think he 'll ever forgive her anyway . " The diversion was over ; t he people drifted away , eager for breadp223and wine and more dancing , anxious to hear the first recital of the bardic competition . There was obviously no more juice to be drained from Eremon 's troubles . Scotta was the last to leave  --  except for Taya . The Mil 's wife lingeredat the doorway of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disordered clothing in private dignity . " I am sorry it has come to this , Taya , " Scotta said . " I have always been fond of you , personally  --  I remember when you used to come to our clanhold as a little girl to listen openmouthed to Amergin 's storytelling . You were always such a pleasant child ; surely more pleasant than Odba has ever been . " " It 's all right , Scotta , " Taya replied . A disheveled woman in a sea of slanting gilded light aswim with dust motes . She lifted her arms slowly , her thoughts elsewhere , and began repinning her tumbled hair . " There must be no clan-war , " Scotta went on , " nor can we afford to damage the alliance with the Artabrians now that we have all those new cattle to protect . Surely you understand ... " Taya favored her with a serene gaze . " Of course , " she replied . Her mouth looked soft and bruised . And triumphant . " I really think you should take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . " Consider some other man ... " " Would you ? " Taya asked . Scotta took a deep breath . " I must get back to the festival , " she said . Eremon stalked beside Odba , feeling the full weight of the Law like a boulder on his shoulders . Since a time recalled only by druids , the Law had protected the hotblooded Celtic tribes from themselves . Composed from the wise pronouncements of respected chieftains and the endless debates of generations of brehons , and guided by the wisdom of the spirits , the Law was sacred . As sacred as the oak , the stones , the harp . The Law . " But there has to be a way , " Eremon promised himself . He had sighted along his spear and seen his quarry waiting , a trophy he now desired above all others . He would never relinquish her . " Dance ! " screamed a voice . " Dance , dance , dance with me ! " A man whirled into the heart of the crowd ; a tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and splendidly jeweled . Oblivious to the tensions of the group he ( lanced right through them and seized  --  cilia 's hands , carrying her away with him. " lr ! " someone breathed in astonishment.  |p224The  tension shattered like glass . There was startled laughter followed by great deep guffaws from the belly as a sudden wildness seized the Gaelicians , one after another , drawing them in Ir 's wake as leaves are drawn after a windswirl . They threw themselves into the pattern of a new and wonderful dance because they could not help themselves ; because dancing was a tremendous release amounting to compulsion . " Dance ! " Ir commanded , and they did . The pipes sang and the drums thudded like happy feet and the people danced . The pattern gripped and held them , color and motion and gaiety snatched from the fiery heart of the sun ; life , life , life ! Odba surrenderedto it thankfully , truly lovely now , her cheeks flushed and her eyes bright . Against his will even Eremon was pulled into the maelstrom , shoved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stamped and turned with his head thrown back and a grin beamingthrough his mustache . Lugaid danced , and Dil ; Scotta and Donn and Scena and Brego , Findbar the brehon and Eber Finn . Eber Finn , weaving his way among the women , his hands reaching for lushness . All this arguing over Taya had stimulated his interest in the woman . His wives were an amiable band , they would not object to an addition to their number . More ways to divide the work , more companionsto share a laugh or a gossip . He was surprised that he had not noticed Taya 's charms before . He watched for her in the pattern of the dance , and when he saw a dark curly head coming toward him Eber prepared his best smile . On the beaten earth of the headland the Gaelicians danced out the newest , oldest dance of all , as the male spirit of fire penetrated the female spirit of earth , and the Mother , in a constant state of labor , brought forth life . And when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and panting and still smiling , enmity at least temporarilyforgotten , the bards gathered for the great competition of oratory . Every clan 's ambition was to have its own bard , but the complex array of gifts necessary for a true bard were seldom bestowed on one man . Still , among the numerous families of the Gaelicians there were enough poets to assure a fine spectacle ; solemn , lofty , intensely meaningful to all present . Bards from areas many nights distant made the long journey just to attend this most prestigious of competitions and try to win honor for their clans . One by one , they now stepped forward to recite the epics and sat/ires and eulogies for which they were famed . Each was rewarded with a gold ring from the arm of a clan-chief or a bullock presented by his retinue , and in the case of an exceptional performance a whole stack of honor gifts was piled at the bard 's feet . Amergin , chief of his profession , was last to recite . He stood on the platform of honor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harp of polished wood and famed power . As the Gaelicians listened , he began to bring to life for them their own history , the saga of their days . The poetic epic he had been so diligently preparing . Clarsah accompanied him , her voice now lyrical , now a thunderingchant , now a soft rain on the tombs of men and women long and never dead . The poetic history flowed like the heartsblood of the people ; wild as Ir , diligent as Donn , celebrating the pastoral life belovedof Eber and the battles that were Eremon 's joy . Strong solid Scotta ; gentle yielding Taya ; Milesios , gruff and wise . Even Colptha 's dark thread wound through the music , an undertone of shadowed mystery . The people , marching and seeking , laughing and weeping and brimming with a zest for life , poets and takers of heads , indomitable in battle but obedient to the Law . Celts . The listening crowd looked at each other with shining eyes , sharingthe joy of an exceptional event . None of them doubted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bard . The sparkle of the harp combined with Amergin 's alliterative phrasing to summon ancient days , touch and sound and emotion spun together to re-createreality and essence .. . Then Amergin 's voice fell silent . The sound of the harp faded to nothingness . The spell was broken , too soon , too abruptly ! The crowd began to murmur with disappointment and confusion . Amergin , stricken , opened his eyes . " It is not finished , " he whispered in a voice so clear it carried like a shout . " The poem is not finished , and I do not know the ending . " With great and terrible dignity , the bard stepped down from the platform of honor . He walked slowly through the crowd and they fell back to let him pass . His head was high , his eyes unseeing . Clarsah rode silently on his shoulder . No one spoke to him , for who would willingly offend a bard ? When he was gone , whispers filled the space he had occupied . His tribespeople crowded together , seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief bard ill ? Is this a bad omen ? " The unexpected end of the competition left everyone anxious andp226baffled . A winner must surely be announced , that was the tradition . But who ? Amergin 's song had promised to be an incomparable triumph , yet he himself had rejected it . The clan-chiefs , the elders , the brehons , everyone who held any degree of authority gathered togetherand argued and reasoned and in the end nothing was decided . The great festival came to a close in the smoldering ashes of its fire and a fresh salt wind blew in from the north , from the sea.  |p227IN  A RAGE of incompletion the bard stalked the headland . Sometimesthe harp rode his shoulder , suspended by her thong ; more often she languished in her gilded satchel while Amergin enduredhis misery alone . Sakkar was distraught . He had come to love the bard 's house as much for its atmosphere as for its comforts . Beneath Amergin 's roof Sakkar had felt both respected and unthreatened for the first time in his life , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tyrian seaman could not have imagined before . He tried to comfort Amergin and restorethe lost harmony . " Master , you must not take this so hard . It is only a poem ... " Amergin groaned . " Only a poem . You do n't understand , Sakkar . What you call a poem was a ... a ship to carry my ancestors , my ambitions , the best part of me . And it is lost in a fog and may never reach shore . I have failed myself and those who entrusted me with the task of composition . " Sometimes , for a few moments only , Amergin allowed himself to wonder if Clarsah had betrayed him . She had only sung an accompaniment , she had not inspired or led him in the epic . Always before she had given him help when he needed it , but at the crucial peak of his career she had taken a secondary role and left the entire burden of creation to him . The betrayal  --  if it was a betrayal  --  was almost more painful than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I unfaithful to you , Clarsah ? " he whispered once in the night . " When did I betray you to cause such cruel retaliation ? " And then he remembered . The sunbathed plain and the chariots circling , the hot high lust for adventure gripping him . . . the agonizedwish to be just one of the warriors , a bard no longer .. .  |p228The  season turned and the first autumnal winds blew , heralds from ice-tinged Marimarusa , sea of the dead . Something vicious gnawed the bard 's groin . The need to create or procreate , he did not know which . They were the same . Tormented , he prowled the cliffs and stared at the sea . The interdiction against Colptha had passed with the change of moons and the sacrificer took part in the rituals once more , but with a new distance between himself and the others . Colptha carried himself with the unmistakable air of a man who has suffered a great injustice . The immense new herd of the Gaelicians was apportioned among the clanholds to gnaw parched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer existed . Miners from neighboring tribes fought to wrest a few last scoops of tin ore from the grudging earth , then set their implements aside and went home to their clans , barring the doors . The wind shrieked and blew . The season threatened to be more bitter than any in bardic memory , grimly cold and grimly dry . There was no fecund moisture left in the land that was once so productive , the Mother who had been so moistly fertile . The repaired Phoenician vessels were at last declared seaworthy , loaded with a cargo of sheep 's wool  --  second grade , as Age-Nor complained to Bomilcar  --  Celtic crafts and salted beef , and prepared to go back the way they had come , racing against the weather . The Mil 's clan lined the headland to view the sailing . The finality of the traders ' departure was not such a tragedy now that countless cows grazed in Gaelician clanholds , but still there were those who felt a tug of sadness as the great galleys hoisted their sails and the shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had accompanied Amergin to see the sight , which he viewed with mixed feelings . Now he was truly cut off from his past , the former shipwright thought  --  but what of his future ? Amergin thought he recognized the figure of Age-Nor in the prow of the foremost galley and lifted his arm in farewell , but instead of returning the gesture , Age-Nor turned away , almost as if he was embarrassed . " That 's strange , " Amergin remarked aloud . " I thought the Tyrian and I had developed a friendly relationship , of sorts . " Sakkar tightened his cloak and began rubbing his shoulder , which ached constantly in the cooling weather . " I do not think the corn/mander was anxious to make friends . He just wanted to get back to Tyre . He was ... what is the word ? . . . disappointed in this voyage , and afraid of Carthage . " " Do n't you miss Tyre , yourself ? " the bard inquired . Sakkar responded with a gap-toothed grimace . Unlike the Gaelicians , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the druids said . " I miss my city , " Sakkar admitted . " Sometimes . I had a woman there . Young . Big with my child . She got sick , legs swelled , urine stank . She cried . I made good enough wages , but the herbalists took it all . Then the priests said I must offer sacrifices or the gods would kill her . I had no coins to buy sacrifices . So I robbed a man . A rich , important man . Someone saw me , and told , for a price . " He related the pitiful tale in the flat voice of fatalism , all emotion long since expunged . " My woman died anyway . The king 's agents were looking for me . To punish me . Ccchhh . " He made a graphic noise and drew his fingeracross his throat . " I escaped with Commander Age-Nor 's fleet . If I went back , they would still kill me . " " That 's unjust , " Amergin protested . " Your wife was sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brehons ? " " We have no brehons . We have a king of the city , and a govern-ment . " " This government you speak of is your tribal council , your eldest and wisest ? " Sakkar laughed hollowly . " Oh , no . Government is men appointed by the king because they will do whatever he says . Rats who eat crumbs from his table . Our law is anything the king desires , and if we object his agents can imprison us , torture us , kill us . " Amergin shook his head . " How can such deeds be used to enforce law ? The spirit can not be imprisoned and never dies ; the body dies anyway , so a threat to kill it means absolutely nothing . Your king is a fool , Sakkar ; especially if he thinks one man can be wise enough to make all the laws for everyone else . " " How is law enforced among your people ? " " We keep it ourselves to avoid dishonor , for a man 's honor is his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its final wealth that can be neither stolen nor bartered away  --  which reminds me : why did n't someone of your clan , your family , help you when your woman was so sick ? One of our clans would he seriously disgraced for neglecting to help a member in trouble . " " I have no family , " Sakkar answered . " I was horn in an alley andp230grew up on the docks , hiding from slavers and snatching food from refuse heaps . If I ever had a mother , she threw me away when I was born . " Amergin had never been so shocked in his life . The Phoenicians described the Mideast as the hub of the earth , compared to which the Celtic tribes lived in brutish outlands . But now Amergin , looking through Sakkar 's eyes , saw the " civilized " world as a composite of savageries where degradation was taken for granted and brutality was an accepted mode of conduct within one 's own family . No wonderthe wise men inveighed against the contamination of cities ! The wool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within anyone 's memory . The women measured it with their finger joints and began hastily weaving additional warm cloaks and blankets against the coming winter . The convocation of brehons met at the next change of the moon , and Eremon appeared before them as was his right to protest his situationand air his grievances . When it was over , he encountered Amergin outside the stronghold gate . " What happened ? " the bard inquired . " I wasted my valuable wind . The brehons found that Odba had fulfilled her obligations as wife under the Law and therefore was within her rights in denying me another wife . The Mil 's order forbiddingme from visiting Taya stands , and as long as I obey Odba has agreed to forget about the eric and about returning to the Artabrians . " Eremon spat out every word as if it had a bad taste in his mouth . " It seems the fairest decision under the circumstances , " Amergin commented . " I was n't seeking a fair decision . I wanted one that would let me have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of himself , Eremon chuckled . " I want it all , you know . " " You always have , " Amergin agreed . " And I still mean to have it . " Eremon pounded one great fist against the open palm of his other hand , like a war drum . " Let it go , Eremon , " Amergin advised his brother . " And let Odba win ? Let her smile in her sleep for the rest of her life , knowing she has thwarted me and somehow gotten my own mother to stand with her ? No ! May the spirits defend me from the terrible power of women ! " The winter grew colder and darker . The hipbones of the cattlep231stood out like the timbers of burned cottages . In addition to the sparse and desiccated grass , they chewed the soil itself in search of nourishment . The Gaelicians slaughtered and salted as much beef as they could , until they ran out of salt and had to begin the laborious process of making more by evaporating seawater . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant tribes as well , but the drought was uniform across the western part of the peninsula and no one had grass for cattle ; no one was seeking larger herds in that bitter season . They had thought themselves wealthy ; now they saw themselves as worse off than before . Milesios was growing weaker every day . Scotta fought a solitary battle to keep anyone from guessing how little remained of the old champion . When he could no longer lead  --  or appear to lead  --  there would be a struggle among the factions eager for his chiefdom , and such a struggle could not come at a worse time . The other clanchiefswere openly eyeing the bronze-sheathed bench in the Heroes ' Hall , and the Mil 's own sons were arguing continually with one anotheras if goaded by some invisible force . The tightly woven fabric of the clan seemed to be fraying , and Scotta was very worried . Eremon took his son Moomneh to the calf pens to select a young bullock for the boy to train . As Milesios had once said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good teachers . You will be a warrior like me , so you will need to develop strength and endurance . You will acquire them from the ox you are going to train . " Each boy , before reaching manhood , must put some brawny headstrong calf into a miniature yoke and train it , leading the animal around until it grew accustomed to the gear . By the time the ox reached maturity the habit of obedience was so firmly establishedthe animal never thought to rebel . The boy who trained it , having matured also in its company , felt a physical bond with the powerful creature , and in addition had had to acquire as much patience and self-discipline as a young Celt could be expected to accept . Eremon watched proudly as Moomneh selected the largest of the newly castrated calves , a bony creature with a broad beige forehead and sprouting horns . " Try him , boy ! " Eremon urged . " Try him now . " Everything he felt about himself he saw , at that moment , in the child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrestled it top232earth to establish an early superiority , then sat on its neck as he was instructed and stroked the animal , crooning to it . " He has my way with animals , " Eber remarked unexpectedly at Eremon 's shoulder . " I sired him ! " Eremon shot back . " Oh , I was n't disputing that . Your Odba has never drawn my eye . I thought your taste in women rather dull , in fact , until I got to know Taya better . " " You leave her alone ! " " Only one woman lives in your house , " Eber Finn said , " and her name is Odba , not Taya . You have no rights where Lugaid 's daughter is concerned . " " I tell you , Taya will be mine somewhere , " Eremon vowed in a voice that rasped and crackled . " If not in my house , then in another one . If not in this world , then in another one . I will have her ! " Winter deepened . The herds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and roiling dust . The starving cattle lowed incessantly , dreaming of vanished green meadows . The weakestdied , and Colptha the sacrificer watched and waited . And then , too late to save the grass , the weather turned . One storm after another roared in off the ocean and the northern bay , smashing against the headland , hurling a spray of white foam back at the gloweringsky . Rain came in torrents . At times it seemed to fall in a solid mass rather than individual drops . The howling wind blew it in horizontallines , driving in through open doorways and seeking out cracks in walls and gaps in thatch . Overgrazed fields , their grass roots destroyed , became glutinous seas of mud . Floods roared along watercourses , catching hapless livestockand sending their bloated bodies swirling downstream , drowned and useless . The world was sodden . The horses ' hooves rotted as they stood , keeping the druids busy preparing poultices for the horseboys to apply . Food left in the pot overnight grew a green fur . Stone walls oozed dampness no hearthfire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind howled . When the drowned land could tolerate no more the ice storms began . Colptha glowed with vindication . " The Earth Mother is furious with us for asking too much of her when she was in a weakened condition . I tried to issue a warning , but 1 was silenced . " Deputations from the various clans and tribes visited the sacredp233groves almost daily , bringing gifts of propitiation to offer to the Mother . And many among them looked at Colptha the sacrificer with new respect . He made certain Irial noticed this , of course . And in private , he commented to Conmael , " The spirits are all on my side , you see ? Everything is being arranged for my ultimate benefit . Now I have a little task for you to do ... " Conmael circulated among the clans , and when he found a receptiveear he said , " Eremon did more harm than good , bringing all those cattle . His judgment is flawed ; he would n't make a good chief of the tribe , would he ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the steadiness and reliability of Donn . " Milesios has always paid more attention to Eremon , I realize , but that 's because Donn is steady and reliable and needs no watching . Donn is oak ; what a fine chieftain he would make . " Eber Finn complained to Jr as the two were checking on their clan 's livestock , " Have you heard this talk about making Donn the Mil 's successor ? Why Donn , answer me that ? He has no ambition and he certainly lacks flair . I 've never seen him lead a battle , though he 's an able enough follower . If some of the people are turning against Eremon , why should n't they turn to me ? I 'm as good as he is in every way , and I was n't responsible for this plague of cattle . " Eber ran an appraising eye over the herd . " But you will notice , Ir , " he could not resist adding , " my share of the clan 's cattle does n't appear as starvelingas the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such thing , had noticed something else . Across the field from the two brothers , young Moomneh appeared with his little ox in tow . To test the calf 's obedience the boy intended to lead it right through the herd , insisting that it follow him without pausing to graze or socialize . But the sight of so many of its own kind excited the calf . It tugged against its lead rope and braced its feet , determined to stay with the herd . Moomneh pulled . The calf pulled back . This was the classic moment when a boy must learn to use his wits instead of his strength , for the animal was already stronger than the human . But Moomneh felt only a stubborn determination to force the issue . He tugged violently and yelled . The calf lowered its head and shook its nubbined horns . Moornneh yelled louder and hit it on the shoulder with the lead rope . A few paces away , Eber Finn 's old black bull raised his head andp234watched . He did not know the boy who stood with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young ox . He only knew he disliked the sight of that flailing rope , and the yelling was heating his sluggish blood . He was hungry and he was in a bad temper . He dropped his head and pawed the earth ; once , slowly , and then once more , cutting deeper into the sticky mud . Moomneh lashed his calf again and it bawled in protest . The bull took a step backward and moved his head from side to side , slicing the air with gleaming horns . " Look out ! " Ir cried , too late . The bull charged . Now Eber saw the boy and bull , but before his mind had time to order a reaction Ir was off and running . He sped over the mud as if it were a hardpacked race course , his golden hair streaming behind him . As he ran he stripped his red cloak from his shoulders and began waving it to draw the bull 's attention . But the animal , with the singlemindednessof its species , saw only Moomneh and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ox calf , running for his life as the hot breath of the bull scorched his neck . The huge animal caught his boyish body between its horns , fortunately not impaling him , and butted him with such force he flew through the air to fall unconscious amid the furze . The bull skidded to a halt and shook its head to clear its rage-reddenedvision . It spotted the form of its enemy lying helpless and still . With a bellow of anger the bull prepared to charge again , to grind the boy into the earth with its horns and trample him beneath its hooves . Ir raced through the herd , spooking them , so the entire mass was soon a chaos of milling , bawling animals , unstable and dangerous . But Ir did not care . He cared only about the boy . He reached the bull just as the animal prepared to charge again . Ir ran in front of it , flapping his cloak in the bull 's face . The bull threw its head up , startled . " Hiya ! " the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , horned one . Chase me ! " He deliberately turned his back on the bull and ran . With a bellow that shook the earth the furious animal came after him , following the red cloak . " You 'll be killed ! " Eber cried to his brother , but it was no use . Tallest of the Mil 's sons , jr of the long legs had always been thep235best runner in the tribe . Now he sped like a swallow before the bull , intoxicated by his own daring . Intoxicated by his flirtation with a painful and ugly death . The danger made him faster ; he felt invincible . He was totally free , he could do anything . The spirits had taken control of him , moving his limbs for him and turning the mud to solid earth beneath his feet . He dodged to one side and swirled his cloak through the air , making a broad red target for the bull . Drawn to the motion , the bull brandished its horns and charged blindly , head lowered and eyes closed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slide over the bull 's shoulders as it passed by him . Eber could not believe his eyes . " Mad , " he commented to no one in particular , shaking his head . And then he screamed , " Do n't hurt my bull , Ir ! " for he saw Jr draw his sword from his belt . " We should never have let Jr wear his sword in the clanholding , " Eber muttered , knowing no warrior would willingly step beyond his house without the symbol of his rank on his hip . When the bull realized its attack had met only empty air it slowed and stopped , turning with eyes open now to relocate its tormentor . Ir grinned and waved the cloak . The bull lowered its head , closed its eyes , and charged . Ir , invincible , waited until the animal was one pace away from him and then stepped back , staying so close that the horns almost grazed his belly . As the bull 's lowered neck passed in front of him he plunged his sword straight down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther , but it was alreadydead . It crumpled slowly to earth , a mountain of flesh emptied of its animating spirit . Ir laughed . He lifted both arms above his head and capered around his fallen enemy , swirling his red cloak in violent patterns and laughing ; laughing . The herd , nearing hysteria by now , wheeled and ran . " By the wind ! " Eber swore desperately , not knowing which way to go . Ir , heedless of everything around him , was dancing his victory dance at the heart of a roiling herd of crazed cattle , while the crumpledform of Moomneh lay in the bushes , waiting for the first running hoof to crush the life from his skull.  |p236A  MERGIN 'S RESTLESS FEET would not submit to standing in a chariot . They insisted on movement , and so , with Clarsah on his shoulder , he paced the clanholding , trying to work out the tangle inside himself and reestablish harmony with his harp . But still he could not force the ending of the epic to take shape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design . The day was cold and raw and he had wandered some distance from the stronghold , paying little attention to the direction his feet chose . Movement caught his attention and he glanced southward in time to see a herd of cattle circling restlessly , a man running through its center  --  and , at the herd 's edge , a boy being struck by a charging bull . Amergin began to run , too . He was too far away to do anything , but he heard Eber 's howl of anger at seeing his best bull mortally wounded , and the bard watched in horror as the cattle took fright and bolted . The fallen boy must be directly in their path , yet Ir seemed obliviousto anything but his otherworldly jubilation . Amergin was fast , but he knew the voice of Clarsah could travel faster . He unslung her from his shoulder and laid his palm against the strings , demanding her magic more urgently than ever before . She sang out in reply . The great harps knew three kinds of enchantments . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts with laughter . There was mourning music , summoning all the sadness of the living into their eyes to be cried away at once , so they could turn away from the tombs and get on with their lives . And there was sleeping music , the soporific capable of making armies yawn , and stretch , and sink to the earth , their swords forgotten at their sides . Amergin held Clarsah and played the sleeping music.  |p237The  sound seemed lost in the rumble of the running herd , but the ears of animals are keener than those of humans , and their spirits are more sensitive to vibrations . Even in their fright the cattle heard the harp and felt invisible hands laid on their heads , soothing them . They circled , slowed , and then walked , milling about rather than stampedingheadlong . Eber reached Moomneh before Amergin could . He hardly knew where to grieve  --  over his fallen nephew or his dead bull . He solved the problem by swearing at Ir . " You weakskulled mooncalf ! " he cried , shaking his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take time to propitiate his spirit first , you just struck him down and set it loose to wander . Perhaps to come back and demand justice from me ! You had no right , it was n't necessary , I could have handled him myself if you were n't so ... " Ir was aware that Eber was mouthing words at him but he did not want to listen . Words would bring him back to earth and lock him in a place and a time , and he wanted to prolong the feeling of floating free , untouchable . The bard came trotting up , panting . " He does n't hear you , " he said to Eber . " Where 's the boy ? " Eber looked at Amergin with growing awe . " You stopped the cattle , " he said incredulously . " You stopped a stampede with your music ! " " Never mind that , help me find the boy . " Abashed , Eber led the way to a slender form crumpled in an icebrittleclump of yellow furze . Moomneh 's pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as the two men bent over him he opened his eyes . In a flash Amergin was cradling him in his arms , feeling his body with the fingers of a druid , sensitive to any disharmony of broken bone or ruptured organ . " He 's all right , I think , " Amergin told Eber . " The wind 's knocked out of him and he 's had a fright , but he 'll go home to Eremon 's house and scrape the leavings from the cooking pot . " Eber , relieved , went over to his bull . " This is a bad omen , " he remarked . " The best of the bulls , the chief bull , is dead . The strength of the herd is cut down . " Moomneh opened his eyes again and smiled up at the bard . " Ai , Amergin , " he said softly . " Did you see me with the bull ? " " I saw you . flow do you feel ? Can you stand up ? "  | " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to his feet and dusted himself off . He glanced once at the ruin of Eber 's bull and quickly looked away . " My ox wandered off , " he said , with a tragic outthrust of his lower lip . " We 'll catch him , " Amergin promised . Moomneh drew a deep breath , savoring the crisp air . The day seemed marvelously beautiful to him , as it does to survivors . " How clean and sparkling everything is ! " he commented . " Enjoy it while you can , " a morose Eber muttered . " As you get older you 'll see the wear and tear . Look , Ir , see what you 've done , " he called to his brother , but Ir was still lost in his own reality . " Ir . Ir ! " Amergin 's voice was sharp , piercing the rosy fog in which Ir floated . " You saved a child 's life , " the bard said . " I 'm proud of you . " He extended his hand and Ir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took hold of Moomneh with his other hand and led the two of them , the bemused adult and the shaken child , in the direction of the stronghold , leaving Eber alone to mourn his bull . After they had gone a few paces Ir roused himself enough to look over his shoulder . The dead bull opened its eye and stared at him . That mean little eye , memorizing his face and form against some futureencounter . There is my enemy , Ir thought suddenly . He shuddered with fear . The bull , the horned one . Now I know his face . A celebration was held that night in the Heroes ' Hall in honor of Ir and Amergin jointly . Scotta , proud mother of heroes , stood behind the Mil 's bench and beamed on everyone . Colptha lounged in his compartment , begrudging Amergin the admiration showered upon him . " Amergin is very quick to take credit , " Colptha said out of the side of his mouth to Conrnael . " Do you really think he stopped a maddenedherd with just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift was that great , actually . And I still do n't . I suspect in the dust and confusion , Eber mistook what he saw . Do n't you agree ? " Conmael had learned among other things the rhetorical nature of the questions the sacrificer put to him , so he contented hirnself with chewing and drinking and did not try to reply . There were times when he thought of himself as a mirror of polished copper ( : olptha held up in which to admire his own cleverness.  |p239Lately  Conmael had made a new friend . A boy fostered into the clan of the ruling chieftain would not normally spend his spare time with a laborer of another race entirely , but Sakkar the Phoenician was not just a laborer . Even Sakkar found it hard to explain his status in the community . " I 'm a gift , " he said when he and Conmael happened to find themselves sheltering from a storm beneath the same roof one morning . " I was a life exchanged for a life . " " But you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a slave . Your bard talks to me the same way he talks to everyone else . He shares his food with me in equal portionsand does not even keep the choice morsels for himself . I do not understand him  --  but I like him . " " My foster father is Colptha the druid , " Conmael volunteered . " He lets me eat from his table , and he talks to me . But I do n't think it 's quite the same . " " What is a foster father ? " " Among Celtic tribes , a child from one clan is often sent to another to be raised . It strengthens ties between the clans and helps hold the tribe together . " " Families are very important to you , " Sakkar remarked . " Is n't your family important to you ? " Conmael asked , puzzled by some hidden sadness in the little man 's voice . " The bard is all the family I have now , " Sakkar replied . Conmael offered Sakkar a freckle-faced , understanding smile . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Colptha kept him apart from everyone else as much as possible , and he had not visited Gosten 's clanholding for several cycles of the moon . There was more than a generation 's difference in age betweenConmael and Sakkar , as well as an inequality of rank and a totalphysical dissimilarity , yet their spirits had a common ground . Sakkar 's dark eyes twinkled in response . Thereafter , whenever Colptha was not watching him Conmael inventederrands to carry him near the bard 's house . Once he had been beneath Amergin 's roof he realized how different the atmosphere was from that of Colptha 's dwelling , where the very air seemed brittlewith ambition and anger . Even when Amergin was not present , echoes of music seemed to cling to his stone walls . The fire on the hearth sang happily to itself : the birds in their boxes clucked in harmony . Conmael discovered as Sakkar had that the bard 's home was a pleasant refuge.  |p240Conmael  also discovered a passion for sea lore , and soon had Sakkarteaching him sailors ' terminology and showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home from a day 's rambles the three sat on the oaken benches with their feet warming at the hearth , and Amergin recited or played Clarsah while the other two listened and drowsed , thoroughly at home . The worst part of Conmael 's day was twilight , when he must scurry back to Colptha with some excuse . Now , in the Heroes ' Hall , Conmael 's mind had wandered off to consider the intricacies of rudders , Sakkar 's most recent lesson . Conmaelwas growing fast now , elongating and becoming gangly , and his jaw had a tendency to sag when he daydreamed . Colptha noticed . He jabbed the boy with a sharp elbow . " Sit up and pay attention , you disgrace me ! Here comes the chief druid , bow to him , show him how my son honors the great Irial . He will speak and you will listen , so sit tall and look attentive . " As Colptha whispered to him , Conmael felt a familiar dark shadow blot out the remembered brightness of the bard 's house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Listen , listen . " The chief druid , his shoulders at last stooping beneath the weight of untold seasons , stepped to the center of the hall . He walked with the deliberate delicacy of a man whose feet hurt . " Heroes bring honor to their people , " Irial proclaimed . " Ir , son of Milesios , enhances the prestige of his clan , and Amergin enhances the order of druids . " It was obvious from the tone of the chief druid 's voice which achievement he found more important . He continued , " Through Amergin we are reminded of the powers of the invisible world , the force of words and music . What we see is only a thin skin and our eyes deceive us ; what we do not see is more potent . Amergin understands . " I am an old man . No , do not shake your heads , good friends , for I am more aware of the seasons than any of you . Ours is the class which counts and measures , and I have counted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the dark . " Something in his words alerted Milesios , who twisted around to look into his face as Irial stood beside him . He saw skin cracked like dry mud , and a fast-fading light . " Soon I will shed this outgrown body , " Irial affirmed . " A new chief druid must be named before then . " Today an old brill died and tonightp241a new young bull stands guard over his cows . Such a sign from the spirits can not be ignored . " It is my obligation to leave the future of the order in good hands , and so this night , even in the darkness that has never been dark to me , I will go to the nemeton . There , alone , I will invoke the spirits and ask their guidance in the naming of my successor , while I still have the strength to be wise . " A hush fell over the hall . Colptha drew a long suck of air through his teeth . " He 's going to choose Amergin , " the sacrificer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says now about consulting the spirits he 's going to name a member of the bardagh to succeed him , instead of a diviner ! " Colptha 's teeth grated together audibly . " Have you had a vision ? " Conmael wondered . " I do n't need any vision to know what will happen now . Did n't you hear how Irial smeared fat on Amergin 's name ? The bard has always been his favorite , only the trees know why , and that business with the cattle today just confirmed him in his intention to place Amergin over us . Idiocy ! I should be chief druid , Conmael . The Mother spoke to me ! " Colptha was experiencing a strange sensation , one that had come to him before , but never so vividly as now . He seemed to be a watcher sitting inside his own skull , peering out through the sacrificer'seyes with sardonic amusement . A wolf stalking through a flock of sheep aware , and singular in his awareness . A flooding certainty of his own gifts and cleverness rose in Colptha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thought , looking at the assembled Gaelicians . ( The silent watcher in his head , watching . ) Trained to recognize the larger pattern , which included these lives but was not limited to them ; a pattern that an aware individual might manipulate to his own advantage . Was a gift such as Colptha 's a mandate , demanding by its very singularityto be used ? Flow sweet it was to think so . Why else would the spirits have been so generous ? He , Colptha the sacrificer , was equipped to shape the pattern of the future according to his own special wisdom for the good of his people . Controlling , them with his skill , his subtle temptations ; enlarging the uses of blood sacrifice .. . his druid training rose up in hirer , silent voices crying out in revul/sion against the vision the watcher painted within Colptha 's vaulted skull . " No ! " Colptha said under his breath . Conmael glanced at him nervously . The balance within Colptha shifted ever so slightly . The symmetry was destroyed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy 's eyes and it was not a healthy strength . " Yes , " he said to himself , a little louder . " Yes . " Conmael wedged himself into a corner of the compartment , wishinghe were a druid so he could melt into the wood and become one with it , beyond Colptha 's reach . Irial left the Heroes ' Hall , pacing with stately tread , bowed with his responsibilities . All eyes followed him . It was as if the great black bull lay dead in the center of the hall , his death the hub of some mighty , unseen wheel , irrevocably turning . When the chief druid had gone the celebration resumed , though with a sense of impending change the more sensitive in the hall could not ignore . Colptha waited until the clamor rose to its usual level and then , with an impatient gesture to Conmael to follow him , he left the hall and went to seek the darkness . Amergin sat on his bench and held Clarsah in his lap to share in his honor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again inspirationhad come from and through the harp , and the man had only been her instrument . He was forgiven , then . He stroked her polished frame , thinking of his poem . Irial had said he understood about the invisible world and the power of words .. . perhaps if he reshaped his epic to make Clarsah the symbol of his people , she would be willing to take part in the creative process again and help him complete his work . He thought , briefly and shockingly , of Age-Nor bartering with his gods , but dismissed the idea from his brain . The harp as symbol for the people .. . Amergin stared into shifting shadows . Symbols . The outward representation of the inner essence . Even human flesh , Amergin saw with druid vision , had little importance save to symbolize something of immortal value contained within it.  |p243All  matter was symbol , then . All that appeared solid was , in truth , ephemeral . How could a man judge one of those fleeting images  --  a tree , a bull , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another ? He stared in astonishment at the perfection of the shared spirit of life in every living thing . Eremon had seen it in Taya , and claimed her , but had been blind to the same quality in Odba , allowing his blindness to make her ugly . Why ? The riddle of existence twisted on and on , and Amergin pursued it down the pathways of his mind . Others , meanwhile , pursued different visions . When Corisios arrived at the sacred grove shortly after dawn he found the chief druid . The diviner was concentrating on the daily tribute to the trees and so at first he did not notice a huddled form beneath one of the oaks . A shaft of sunlight , piercing through the leaves , brought it to his attention . He could not believe he was seeing a man . The object was so insignificant in appearance , a mere heap of discarded .. . " Irial ! " Corisios cried , running forward . He quickly summoned the few other trained samodhii and , though they examined Irial 's body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . Yet the chief druid did not look as serene as a man should after willingly surrendering to old age in this sacred sanctuary . His mouth was twisted , his lips drawn back from his teeth , and his blackened tongue protruded slightly . His fingers were hooked into claws as if he fought something . Yet there was no blood , no wound . He might almost have been smothered by the mound of drifted leaves that pillowed his head. 011ach , the sandy-haired senior samodhi , now that Irial was dead , ran his healer 's fingers over Irial 's body again and again , frowning as he did so . " I feel more than death here , " he said at last . " There is a residue of ... surprise . And anger . I felt it when I first touched his skin ; it almost burned my fingers in spite of the cold . " Druids were arriving like streams of water hurrying to form a pool . The wind carried word of trial 's death beyond the boundaries of Gaelician territory to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creeping into hidden valleys , curling around tombs , sum/moning . The members of the order , whatever their tribe , were informedby a deep unease of spirit and began traveling by foot or chariot or oxcart to the sacred groves . " Irial is dead , " 011ach informed them . " Dead before his appointed night , we think . " " Do you mean ... he was killed ? " Findbar the brehon asked , unable to imagine such a thing but chilled by an almost malignant atmospherelingering in the grove. 011ach bowed his head . " If so , this is the most severe disharmony of my lifetime , for Irial was slain here in the nemeton , and the repercussionswill be beyond our ability to measure . " " Perhaps you are mistaken , " someone said hopefully . " Only the Earth Mother knows for certain , and the trees , who saw . " Amergin spoke . " Corisios , you are of the trees . Throw the staves and furrows of wisdom and read them ; tell us who did this deed and why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw the ogham croabh . But for the second time in recent experience he could not read them clearly ; their meaning was blurred by vibrations still emanating from the place and the deed . He forced himself as he had never forced himself before . For Irial , he thought . Help me , Irial . He threw the sticks again and the message on their carved faces this time was as clear to him as the lines on his palm . " I see a man and . . . a small man ? " he said aloud . " Darkness . Not one , but many dangers .. . the water drags you down ! " he shrieked suddenly . " What does that mean ? " 011ach demanded to know . Colptha stood just behind him , his white face stiff with tension . Corisios fought his way back to the solid world through a dizzying haze . He felt very tired . " Someone was angry ; someone else was ter-rified . " " Ai ! Irial was killed , then ! " " The matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to intervene , " Corisios said , recalling the pattern of the sticks . " The crime , if crime it was , was so terrible no living man is capable of judging it . The retribution , if retribution is needed , must be so terribleno living man is capable of it . Irial himself is many lives past the seeking of vengeance and we must allow him to go on ; his spirit does not wish to be held here because fear and anger are kept alive . Balancewill be restored in the invisible world ; that is what the ogham croabh promises . "  |p245No  search for the killer ; no honor price paid . Acceptance came hard , even for druids , but they bowed to the authority of the invisible world . Yet each man felt an unseen presence at his back . Not that of the benign Irial , but a hideous haunting that defiled the sanctuary . A sickening realization moved through them . Only those who were druids would dare visit the sacred groves at night , so a druid must have raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion . The shame was too great to reveal to any outside the order . If Trial wished the murder unrevenged in this world , it would be so ; by common consent the druids would let it be assumed that Irial had died of an excess of seasons . But in the days to come the members of the order would look at one another with suspicion , feeling its poison permeate their rituals and their holy place . In death , the chief druid commanded even more ritual than he had in life . As a son of the trees , he would not be entombed . His body was to be burned on a funeral pyre constructed of only sacred woods , and his ashes would be entrusted to the keeping of the wind . Milesios was stunned by the occurrence . " I thought I would die first , " he told Scotta , over and over again . " I thought the omen of the bull was meant for me , in fact . And I do n't understand this  --  it was n't like Irial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successor named . " " No , it was n't , " Scotta agreed . She was at least glad to see Milesios taking an interest . " But now you can forget about your own transitionand get on with living , because whatever sacrifice was required has already been made . " Milesios , uncertain , went off by himself to think . He found it an effort to get his rusty mental equipment polished and usable again ; living was obviously harder than dying . But the confusion the tribe felt as a result of the chief druid 's death demanded that at least one strong hand remain to guide them , as Scotta was quick to remind him . Besides , the pains in his belly seemed to have diminisheda trifle . And was it his imagination , or was the ache in his joints also lessened ? He certainly did not seem as nauseated as he had recently . He ate a little broth from the pot and it stayed down . He took a flesh-fork from its hook and ripped a tiny morsel of meat from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly , surprised to find it tasted good.  |p246Perha|ps  not good , but not bad , either . He was able to swallow it and eat more . That night he did not fall at once into exhausted slumber but sat beside the hearth talking about the tribe 's business with Scotta as they had done in so many past seasons . " Irial 's pyre will be lit at the next sunrise , " Milesios said , " and I think we can expect representatives from every tribe in the region . It 's amazing how fast news travels along the druid chain . There will be a big crowd and they will all come through our clanholdings , where they can not help noticing our scrawny cattle . They will perceiveus as impoverished ... and weak . We have a serious problem there , Scotta . I should have done something about it sooner . " Scotta squeezed her hands together in her lap . Irial , she thought . From the next world , Irial has arranged with the spirits to send my husband back to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleached the eastern sky the next morning , the crowd gathered to offer final honor to the most famous of chief druids . Champions and chieftains arrayed in mantles of mourning stood respectfully beside their chariots , their heads lower than that of the body waiting on the funeral pyre . As the dead man was a druid , there would be no funeral gifts . Irial would go forward to his new life , whatever and wherever that might be , enriched not by manmade artifacts but with the immeasurably more valuable wisdom accrued in the life just concluded ; a treasury only druids could transport through the transition called death . " Druids can remember between lives , " was an axiom every mother taught her children . " All others are allowed to forget . " The great bard Amergin stood beside Irial 's funeral pyre and recitedthe genealogy of the deceased , calling upon the spirits of his ancestors to be witness to the respect he had earned in this life . " He was a man of long head and keen eyes , " Amergin sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see clearly even those things that are most painful to see . Irial could look through smoke and see flame ; could look through clouds and see stars . Irial 's special vision extended past the painted surfaces to the inner truth . " When the eulogy was completed Amergin stepped aside so the torchbearers could set the pyre ablaze . Its light carried far out over the sea , a rival for the rising sun . As Milesios returned to his stronghold with the sound of Amergin 's eulogy still ringing in his ears , he seemed to see with freshly openedp247eyes himself , as if the bard 's words had somehow cleared his own vision . He was astonished at the number of people who crowded the area . So many children had been born in the long fat seasons of the Mil 's lifetime ; so many mouths to be fed . His ears seemed to hear with restored vigor , catching snatches of conversations he formerly ignored . " Eremon is to blame , " one clanchiefwas saying to another , " for the destruction of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Are you blind ? " Milesios demanded to know , rounding on the speaker . " The cattle who are destroying your fields are also going into your children 's bellies to keep them from starving to death ! If Eremon and his heroes had not brought back all that livestock from the land of the Astures , what would your clansmen eat ? Food bought from traders with tin we no longer possess ? " The men shrank from their chieftain 's anger . " I never personally blamed Eremon , " the second one protested . " I just know that some are saying ... " " What some ' ? Where do these rumors start ? " the Mil demanded to know . The man waved his hand . " On the wind . " " Then consign them to the wind , do n't pass them on . " Milesios stalked away , glowering . Hearing an attack against any of his sons , the part of himself destined for the future , angered him . There were obviously divisions in the tribe , dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without conscious volition , to retreat to some shadowy area where the world and its problems seemed unreal to him and the unwinnable challenge of aging could be sidestepped by sinking into illness instead . In this marginal area of misdirection he had been occupied and shielded  --  but life had refused to make it so easy for him , for the grizzled warrior . As always , life had continued on its own path and now he found himself awake once more and very far behind . Within a few nights of Irial 's death the Milesian clan was aware that their patriarch was taking a much more active interest in daily business . Amergin was one of the first to notice , and he felt a sense of relief when he thought of the savage , slashing satire he might have composed , bringing down a chieftain before his time . His vision of the strength remaining in Milesios had been accurate then ; true guidancefrom the invisible world . Colptha thought otherwise . Ile told ( ; onniael , " Milesios is a used/up hulk with only one sputtering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they die soon , as he must . He must ! And then the tribe will need a new leader . " " Donn ? " " Of course , Donn ! And the sooner the better . Now that Irial is gone the entire order of druids must choose his successor among themselves , since Trial left him unnamed . They are uncertain and keep putting it off , but they can not delay forever . If I can forestall them until Milesios  --  who would never use his influence in my behalf  --  is gone , I can see to it that Donn is chief of the tribe . And he will support me in turn as new chief druid . " " How can you be sure ? " " Ah , Conmael ; I have my ways . You , of all people , know that I have my ways . I was given gifts necessary to help me achieve power because my tribe needs me in these hard days . " The sacrificer 's eyes blazed with such passionate conviction that Conmael almost believed him ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , in the druid tradition . Colptha 's vision of his own destiny was compelling . But that certainty was not a blanket Conmael could extend to cover and comfort himself . When he was not in Colptha 's company he could see that he was nothing more than a tool , less important to Colptha than his sacrificial knife . The boy had allowed the druid to manipulate him  --  at first only in small ways , too petty to be refused  --  until obedience had become a habit and then a compulsion , forced on him by the sacrificer 's whispered commands and irresistibleeyes . Now Conmael was helpless , knowing he had lost the precious ability to say no . Lost the one word that was the key to freedom . His nights were spent in feverish wakefulness , holding himself rigid to keep from tossing and attracting Colptha 's attention . His days were worse . When he could bear it no longer , he wrapped himself in his warmestcloak and went to see his friend Sakkar , hoping to talk out the poison chewing his belly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amergin 's house . Even in his own misery , Conmael noticed an improvement in the shipwright 's damaged shoulder . The samodhiihad driven probes through the skin , applied poultices and braces , and now Sakkar carried himself almost normally , though one arm was not yet as strong as the other . Sakkar waved at Conmael with his good arm and beckoned thep249boy into the warmth of the bard 's house . " My master is not here , " he said , " but I welcome you in his name . " Sakkar had learned Gaelician formalities and he enjoyed using them . Conmael hesitated . " Sakkar , " he began abruptly , " have you seen men killed ? Have you ever . . . helped kill anyone ? For what you believedat the time was a good reason ? " " Shipwrights are not warriors . " " I do n't mean in a war . " Sakkar had a polite way of averting his eyes to avoid enlarging another person 's embarrassment . " At sea , of course , one sees deaths frequently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at sea . If he had struggled I might have killed him . " Two red spots , like the hectic touch of fever , burned on Conmael 's cheeks . " Would you have regretted it afterward ? " Sakkar considered . " I can not say . At the time , nothing seemed as important as getting that man 's purse . Later ... " " Yes , " Conmael said miserably . " Later . " Turning his back on warmth and shelter , he walked away , heading into the north wind . Milesios called a meeting of the clan-chiefs and the council of elders . There were no female clan-chiefs at the moment , but many of the elders were women and Scotta took a place among them , radiatingsilent pride over her restored husband . When Ferdinon strode into the hall she scarcely glanced at him . His mustache seemed skimpy compared to the great drooping ornament of silver-gilt on the Mil 's lip . Ferdinon 's lisp sounded ineffectual contrasted with the Mil 's deep voice . " I have become aware , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maneuver this or that person closer to the chieftain 's bench , to take my place if I should fail . I hear you muttering but you need not try to deny it . I remind you that I am not yet in my tomb , and I tell you this : I will oppose , even beyond death , any man who tries to elevate himself by discrediting one of my sons ! " Donn squirmed in his compartment . He was uncomfortably aware that factions had formed and pressures were being applied . Only the clay before he had said to Dil , " I 'm really flattered , but I 'm not so certain I want to lead the tribe , wife . Such a complicated undertaking , so many considerations . . . all I ever truly wanted was to ... " " 1'o stand as high in the M il 's affections as E:remon , " Dl finished for hire . " Ai , Donn . " She had sighed and beckoned to him to put his head in her comfortable lap . Now Milesios was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I agree that he is rash and hasty " ( he cast a reproving glance at the ruddy warrior son he had thought most like himself ) , " but our problem is not just one of too many cattle . Our problem is too many people for the land to support . " " There can never be too many people ! " a clan-chief cried out . " People are strength ! " An old woman rose from her seat among the elders . " In cities , where slave labor supports free folk , people are strength , " she agreed , " but we have no desire for cities . We depend on the Earth Mother , and the druid Colptha says we have asked too much of her without repaying her by sufficient sacrifices . He reminds us that maintaining a good relationship with the Mother is the profession of druids . " " Providing for the tribe is the profession of warriors , " Ferdinon proclaimed . " If we have too many people and not enough land the answer is simple . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into their territory . What about the Asturians ? " " I made a treaty with them not to invade for three generations , " Eremon pointed out . Milesios gave his son a cold look . That unauthorized arrangement had increased Eremon 's prestige at the time , but in retrospect it seemed shortsighted . Eremon was too fond of making grand gestures . " What about the land of the Artabrians ? " Eber Finn suggested , unable to resist a dig at Eremon . " We have an alliance there too , " the warrior sighed . " Or the Celtiberians , inland ? " " The drought also destroyed their grasslands . And they are very well armed . " No one had a solution . The discussion disintegrated into a free-forall , one Gaelician after another making a suggestion only to have the flaw in it pointed out by someone else . When this day began with the last sunset no one had worried about overpopulation on exhausted land ; now the problem sat in their center like a squamous toad , pollutingthe very air they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yawned constantly , but nothing was decided . The participants at last went home to worry beside their own hearthfires . " Now I 'm certain I have no desire to be chieftain , " Donn confided to Dil over a late supper . " How can a man think clearly when everyone'syelling at him ? But Milesios seems strong again ; he 's solved problems before and surely he 'll find an answer for this one . "  | " It is n't one problem , but many , " Dil said . " Nothing left to lure the Sea People ; mud and flood and starving cattle ; dissension among both men and women . And now the Mil says the trouble is too many people ... " " The trouble is my dinner , " Donn muttered darkly , poking at his food with distaste . " Boiled beef . Oxbone broth . Calves ' tongues in vinegar . Is n't there a stewed eel around here anywhere ? Or a roasted seabird , anything ? I 'll eat cormorant eggs if you have them . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmly . " The Mother is pained by their starving cries . " " I swear by the moon ! Once Milesios solves this problem for us I will never eat any more beef as long as I live ! " Eremon had become adept at finding ways to avoid his own house . After the meeting broke up in the Heroes ' Hall he wandered to Amergin 's house , peering around the doorpost as if he just happened to be passing by . " Are you doing anything ? " he asked innocently . " Unfortunately , no , " the bard replied . " Is the meeting over ? I left early ; they did n't seem to be getting anywhere , but now I do n't seem to be accomplishing anything either . Come in and sit by the fire if you like . There 's only driftwood on the hearth , but it burns warm and Sakkar and I have some wine you can share . " Eremon needed no more urging . He sprawled onto a bench and wiggled his cold toes closer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There has been some talk against you , " Amergin told him . " I 've heard it , but I paid no attention . There is always talk of one kind or another , most of it no more than blown air . " " It 's more than talk , " Eremon said . " At first I thought Donn was actively trying to discredit me , but now I 'm not so sure . Disloyalty just is n't like him . " " No , it is n't . Who among us is guileful enough to try to turn us against each other ? " He asked as a man does who has already decided on the answer . Understanding dawned slowly in Eremon 's eyes . " Colptha ! " " Yes . " " But why ? I have no great fondness for him ; the only one who will tolerate him is Donn and Donn will put up with anybody . But why would Colptha want to hurt me ? " " I ca n't answer that , but I feel certain he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Colptha never did anything forp252anyone except himself ; you can be certain this ploy to have Donn elected chieftain is not for love of Donn . " The men stared at the fire in silence for a time . Eremon stretched his legs farther and sighed . " I wish I could think of some dazzling answer to our problems . Then I would be back in the Mil 's good favor again ; he 's still angry with me , I can feel it . If I were his certain favoriteagain this move to support Donn would fade away and Colptha would be thwarted in whatever it is he 's trying to do . As I have been thwarted lately , " he added sourly . " We do have problems , " Amergin said , " but it is wrong to wish to solve them just to hurt someone else . When did you start hitting at your brothers in real anger , Eremon ? " When Eremon did not answer , Amergin turned his thoughts to the flames , watching islands of light appear in a crimson sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparks and a brief golden forest bloomed above the coals . Sakkar moved closer to the hearth , stretching out his hands to warm them . Calloused hands . Shipwright 's hands . Amergin heard his own voice speaking as if from very far away , surprising all three of them . " We could build ships and sail to a fertile new land , " the bard said . " We could go to Ierne. "  |p253IERNE  . Amergin said the name aloud and the world as it existed withinhis familiar stone walls shrank ; swelled , spun , spiraled outward in pulsating waves of radiance . Was concentrated in one breathless word symbolizing a universe of dreams . The blood beneath Amergin 's skin prickled and boiled . " Ierne , " he said . And saw with wonder how the pattern had been formed , the great spirit of life catching the seemingly unrelated threads of Itos and Ierne and Age-Nor and Sakkar and Eremon  --  and Amergin 's aching , restless hunger  --  and weaving them all together , forcing this momentwith irresistible purpose . Ierne . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had becomepossible because he said the word . Because he pulled it out of his own heart and gut and held it up for all to see . Ierne . Green island of green wind , really out there , somewhere ; waiting . Waiting for the bard to reach out and grasp it and claim it ; promised to him in a thousand lonely nights and dreaming days . He clamped himself around it with all his strength , willing myth into reality . " We could go to Ierne , " said Amergin . His words went through Eremon like the blade of a dagger . " Ierne ? Where 's that ? " the warrior demanded to know . When Amergin answered , the passion throbbing in his clear voice captivated his listeners . He spoke of Ierne as other men speak of battlevictories and women and strong sons . He spoke as a man speaks of limitless possibilities . " I will tell you the story old Itos told me , " he began , and li.rernon and Sakkar leaned forward like small children , tense with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been given to him , everp254mindful of passing on another man 's truth . And then he bent and shaped words with his bardic gift until he re-created the far homelandof his dreams , bringing to life the rounded hills and fern-shadowedglens , streams roiling with fish , meadows rolling with flowers . He gave them his truth for Ierne as it had built in silence within him long before he heard the name . As it had built in silence within him because it simply had to be there . Erem6n 's fierce blue eyes glazed with pleasure as he listened . Even the most aggressive warrior honors the power of the poet ; it is the Law . Even Sakkar , who had thought himself marvelously content where he was , began longing for the shores of Ierne as the bard 's words constructed them . " How do we get there ? " Eremon asked eagerly . Amergin 's vision , which had been fixed on Ierne , suddenly wheeled within him and he had a vivid flashing memory of Age-Nor 's face , with its guile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Age-Nor told him of Ierne , the bard had also felt a growing , uncomfortable suspicion : the cunningTyrian would do nothing without selfish purpose . The druid had seen deeply into the merchant , and knew him . Still . . . Age-Nor was gone , and whatever he hoped to gain could scarcely be realized now . Ierne , however , was still out there , beyond the ninth wave , waiting . " Sakkar knows how to build the kind of ships that could carry us there , " Amergin said . Eremon 's head swiveled and he fixed Sakkar with a look of commandinginterest . " Is that true ? " " The bard always speaks truth ! " Sakkar replied , surprised to hear him scold a warrior as if they were equals . But this was a night of surprises , and Sakkar 's newfound audacity was not the least of them . " I am a trained shipwright , " he went on to explain . " I know how each plank must be laid and every joint caulked . I can design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " He jumped up and ran to a carved chest Amergin had given him to store his growing assortment of personal possessions , gifts given him by Milesians for whom he had been doing small jobs of woodworking as his shoulder mended . He returned carrying a tightly rolled set of sea charts , wrapped in oilskins . " Commander Age-Nor gave me these as a parting present , " he told the two Gaelicians as he carefully removed the charts from their packaging . " I thought it was most peculiar at the time , for whatp255master gives presents to a bondsman he is disposing of ? But he said he had no further use for them and was most insistent that I take them . These maps show the waters from here to the Pretanic Islands . " Amergin 's suspicion flared again . " Was most insistent ? " Had AgeNorbaited a trap and even left them maps leading to it ? But to what purpose ? And even if that were so , what difference did it make , balanced against the radiant possibility of reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagining time were as fluid as Irial had taught ; imagining he could move backward and unsay the words , keep Ierne for himself alone , glowing in his heart , uninvaded , unsullied , unproven . Then he grabbed the charts from Sakkar 's hands and spread them out on the floor in the firelight . Two dark heads and one golden one bent over them . Ierne . Real , and on maps ! " Look at this , Eremon , " Amergin said . " I have no knowledge of sea charts , but is n't this the shape of our own coast ? It seems to me we could sail right along the edge of the land for most of the way to ... what is this , here , Sakkar ? " The shipwright squinted . " The Pretanic Islands . And yes , there are only two serious stretches of open sea if you follow the route along the rim of this vast bay to the north of us . " " If you follow ? " Eremon laughed . " You mean , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us and going with us , Sakkar ; we have no one else who knows the sea . " Beneath his olive skin , Sakkar 's blood receded from his face . The enormity of the idea began to seep into the marrow of his bones . These men were talking as if he , alone , could take them to Ierne . Would take them to Ierne ! " Master , I . . . you can not mean this seriously . . . " Sakkar held out his hands to Amergin . " The dangers are enormous , particularly for landmen . It takes years to learn to sail ships , you would have to ... " " Nonsense , " snorted Eremon . " We can do anything anyone else has ever been able to do , and probably do it better . You wo n't discourageus that easily . And if you can design the vessels and supervisethe construction , we have plenty of trained craftsmen who can build ships for us . The samodhii seem to be healing your shoulder , I can see that from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor yourself in tune . " He turned toward his brother . " Think of it , Amergin ! Ore and timberland and deep green pastures , you said . " His voice thickened with desire.  |p256Truth  demanded the bard remind his brother , " Age-Nor said something about a small population of natives ... " " Natives ! We do n't have any agreements with them , do we ? No fosterings or intermarriages , no alliances to honor ? So what are the natives of Ierne to us ? We are mighty warriors , they will stand no chance against us . " His enthusiasm was galloping faster and faster , like a runaway horse . " A fertile new land and a fresh start , Amergin . " His eyes gleamed hotly as the most persuasive reason of all occurred to him . " Milesios has sworn me to keep my hands off Taya as long as I live in his clanhold , but if I led the expedition to Ierne I would have a clanhold of my own ! Milesios is too old to make such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my own new house and my own new woman in it ! " Amergin chuckled in spite of himself . Given the seed of an idea Eremon could grow the whole tree instantly and taste the juice from its fruit running down his throat . His headlong recklessness was necessary ; it would propel them northward against all odds . And the bard must go northward . For him as for Eremon , the futurenow existed as reality . " You 're not talking about an expedition , but a colony , " he said aloud . " We 'll colonize Ierne ! " " Yes ! Taking many of our tribe to a fertile new land is the answer to so many of our problems . It 's the answer we 've all been searching for , and we must go to Milesios right away and tell him of it . If I give Ierne to the tribe , who can deny me the chiefdom there ? " Amergin stood up abruptly , a muscle knotting in his jaw . " Ierne is n't yours to offer , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He already saw the ugly shape of the rivalry that would build between himself and the warrior and knew it was the price to be paid for Ierne . Part of the price . " Of course , of course , " Eremon laughed with great good humor . " I 'll give you full credit , do n't worry . But let 's go see Milesios right now . " He too was on his feet , hurrying toward the door . The bard 's long strides caught up with him and carried Amergin out before him. to . Milesios had already fallen asleep . He lay with mouth agape , snoring an old man 's snores . Scotta was reluctant to disturb him but Amergin and Eremon were insistent.  | " Your sons say they must talk with you , now ! " she yelled in her husband 's ear . " They say it is urgent . " Milesios dragged himself back from some sodden swamp , some deep dank pit he had to crawl out of , hand over hand , until at last he opened his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not recognize them . Scotta brought the seven-colored cloak of chiefdom and wrapped it around his shoulders , talking briskly to him all the while until he could fix his attention on her words and understand . Then he looked beyond her to Eremon and Amergin , and nodded a greeting . " This had better be very important , " he warned , yawning . They told him , Eremon rushing in first with a torrent of words . The Mil hitched his cloak around his body and tried to make sense of what Eremon was saying , but at last he silenced the warrior with an impatient gesture . " You tell me , Amergin , " he commanded . " You 're not hoarse and you do n't babble . " Amergin obeyed . Several times Eremon tried to interrupt him but the bard raised his voice to its full thundering power and overrode him . Not this time , brother , he thought . You will not grab what is mine . He described Ierne for Milesios as he had described the island for Eremon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The words forced the dream to fill the room , glowing ; the land he had whispered of only to Clarsah . His land , the bard 's land . Ierne . Milesios heard him through , then said , " I have heard of Ierne before . Traders talked of it still , when I was very young , though I have not heard it mentioned for many seasons now . " You have given me much to think about . When I lay down to sleep a while ago the future was like an enemy who had all the weapons , but it seems more promising now . Go away and let me think on this . " Shortly after midday the citharadagh pipers summoned a second meeting of clan-chiefs , elders , and the sons of the Mil . Before the moon had changed the news was spread throughout Gaelician territory . For the first time in generations the tribe would be on the move again , not in wagons and chariots but in ships , daring the dark sea . An adventure beyond all imagining . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on telling everyone ; already remembering it that way.  | " I did not expect the need to arise within my lifetime , " Milesios told his followers , " but our tribe has become a great river that must fork or wash away all before it . We will therefore send half the tribe to seek out new land on Ierne , a force large enough to assure conquestand colonization of a sparsely peopled island . The remainder of our tribe will stay here , where the Mother has adequate strength to support their reduced number . " The Gaelicians heard this pronouncement with a variety of emotions . " Who will go ? Who will stay ? " was on everyone 's lips . The idea of a sea voyage into the unknown terrified many who did not dare say so aloud because they were more frightened of the ridicule of their fellows . What Celt could admit to cowardice ? " Who will stay ? Who must go ? How long before we have to de-cide ? " Ierne . " Timber and ores , it is said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water no doubt . We can run huge herds on the limitless grass . . . " enthused the eager . " Who says the grass is limitless ? " asked the more prudent . " The bard , " Eremon answered , suddenly remembering Amergin 's involvement in all this , though remembering it as a lesser role than his own . " Get the bard to tell you about Ierne . " They came to Amergin with uncertainty carved into the lines of their faces , and he gathered them in a circle around him while he sang of lush lakelands and silver-reeded rivers . And they left him reassured , already adopting Ierne as a dream of their own . It was too large a dream to realize without help , Amergin understood . The energy , the skills , the courage of many people would be needed if any one of them was to reach Ierne ; it was not a vision he could hug to his breast in solitude any longer . So he looked deep into each man and woman and found the secret longings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to life , embodied in Ierne . And the Gaelicians clamored for the unknown island . " Who will go ? Who must stay ? How soon can we depart ? " " We will choose the clans by lot when the time comes , " Milesiosdecreed . " The druids will tell us when the auspices are best . " " But there is still no chief druid , " the clan-chief Caicher complained . " How can we look to them for guidance ? " " Sakkar says it will take a long time to train craftsmen and assem/hie materials , and longer still to build the ships , " Milesios replied . " By the time we are ready to select the clans , there will undoubtedly be a new chief druid . " Undoubtedly Colptha , the sacrificer promised himself . Someone who knows the true faces of the spirit world ; someone who knows that the stones of sacrifice thirst for blood to drink . " I should be chief of the order right now , " he raged to Conmael . " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in no hurry to name Irial 's successor . They were watching one another out of the corners of their eyes and more than one of them performed certain rituals in secret , petitioning the spirits to divulge the name of Irial 's killer . The answer was no . No informative visions were forthcoming . Human vengeance was not requested . And though the entire order had been made well aware of Colptha 's qualifications ( " I was the only one to be warned of the disaster of the cattle ! " ) , still no one proposed his name as the next chief druid . The sacrificer redoubled his efforts to promote an increasingly reluctantDonn as the Mil 's own successor , until even Milesios lashed out at him , " I am not dead yet , druid ! Keep to the spirits and leave tribal affairs to me . " Tribal affairs had grown both more challenging and more complex , and Milesios was  --  secretly  --  unsure of his own strength to deal with the coming adventure . Eremon must constantly be watched and reined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an unexpected ally , particularly when new waves of hesitation swept over the tribe . " There is no question but that we must follow where the pattern has led us , and send many of our people to Ierne , " the chieftain told Arnergin . " They lean forward like horses awaiting the start of a chariotrace , but then they fall back and leave slack in their breastplates . This is a great thing we are asking of them , a march across the tracklesssea , and as the time grows nearer they may cling more and more resolutely to the Earth Mother . " I have heard the power in your words , bard , and I know that you and only you can unclench the Gaelicians from this land and send them outward . I hid you do it . " This was the closest that Aniergiii would ever come to approval and conunendation iron ' Milesios , and he knew it ; he stood withp260bowed head for a moment , absorbing it , trying to make it be enough . With Clarsah in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing of Ierne , reciting poetry that did not , perhaps , have basis in any reality except his own heart 's truth  --  but it was enough . Where Amergin passed , voices were raised in a continual , swelling roar : Ierne , they cried . Ierne ! A drumbeat across the land . A signal fire from high ground to high ground , diminishing distance . Another voice still sang to Amergin on the wind , in his few private moments , but now he could answer  --  I am coming . But there were nights when the bravery inspired by the bard 's poetrydwindled into bravado , and then faded away altogether , to be replaced by the inevitable uncertainty and fear . Amergin was as susceptible to it as anyone else . More than once he lay in his bed in the darkness and was chilled by reality . No one in all the Gaelician territory had ever sailed to the Pretanic Islands ; even Sakkar had not made the voyage himself , all his information came from others who claimed to have done so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or totally spurious . The act of faith required to believe in such a possibility was almost beyond imagining , itself . Yet they were imagining it . They were preparing to attempt it . In boats that might not be seaworthy  --  how could anyone know , until lives were risked on the water ? Would they be attacked by the Sea People once they ventured off solid earth ? Would the ocean last , or become a waterfall cascading off the rim of the world and plunging them all into some terrible dark gulf from which no one ever re-turned ? Terror quivered in the night , when their stock of courage was lowest . The Gaelicians lay in the darkness and thought these things , or whispered them softly to husband or wife on the pillow . Hearts raced , hands clutched at each other , desperate for reality and certainty . But in the morning , when the soft green wind summoned Amergin again , he got up and slung Clarsah from his shoulder and set out to sing to his people of Ierne , refusing to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rang through the land , their beauty more compelling than the fear a Celt would not admit aloud , in daylight.  |p261It  might all be a trick ; it might all be an illusion . But all life was an illusion and death and rebirth were certain anyway . So one might as well reach out to the dream , and dare . As he had fought his shyness and self-doubt , Amergin now fought back his anxieties and reached hungrily for Ierne . His brothers were also scorched by the mounting fever of excitement . Eber Finn no longer planned to contest with Eremon for the Mil 's bench and belt and Gaelician clanholdings ; the familiar honors of his homeland seemed shabby in comparison to the riches Amergin had furnished to his imagination . While the bard told of Ierne in the Heroes ' Hall , Eber sat in his compartment , but only his body was present . His unfocused eyes gazed through granite walls to a place all his own , the Heroes ' Hall of Eber Finn on the island of Ierne . On Ierne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carved from some massive oak that fed its roots in earth laced with gold . Bright coverings would hang from his walls and his roof pillars would be inlaid with pure copper . Great hounds would lounge at his feet , lifting their heads with negligent grace to lick his fingers . His father 's hounds were old and surly and crawling with vermin , but there would be no vermin on his island ; in his hall . His women would wear gold taken from his own earth and fashionedby craftsmen sworn to him , not perverted by Hellene influences . Scotta would have new jewelry from his hand ; a broad gold lunula to wear around her neck like a polished moon , the gift of her loving son . His cattle would grow sleek on grasslands reputed to stay green even in winter . There would be enough timber to build houses ; warm dwellings not chilled by damp stone walls . Eber leaned back and closed his eyes , smiling . In his adjacent compartment Eremon dreamed similar dreams , their shape subtly changed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw himself as a chieftain in a mighty hall  --  but his hall was less luxurious than Eber 's . It was a gathering place for warriors , with shields hung on its walls , and a dark-haired , submissive woman tended its hearth . Eremon 's children would learn new traditions that he himself would establish . There would be more hospitality offered to one 's friends for the sheer pleasure of it , and no female voice would cornplainwhen the heroes stayed up all night together , drinking wine and celebrating life . Exuberant wars would give every man the op/portunity to measure himself against another and grow stronger  --  with Eremon the strongest among them . " I will be the leap over Milesios , " he promised himself , not realizing he spoke aloud . But Amergin heard him in passing and stopped by his stall . " What did you say ? " Eremon imagined his brother superimposed over a battlefield ringing with the brazen voice of trumpets . " I said Ierne will be sword land , " he replied , with trumpets still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will fret away with boredom there . We will hunt the boar and the stag for days without end , and we will set a new style for courage . My people will be splendid in battle and generous in victory , Amergin ; we will grow stronger sons than ever and our daughters will be as charming as Taya . Everything will be perfect on Ierne . " " Sword land , " the bard said in a cool voice . " Is that all you think about ? " " I am a man ! My purpose is to acquire for my tribe , to protect them and add to their prestige . " " You share the same purpose we all have , Eremon . We exist to praise the great spirit of life and find beauty in all its manifestations . " " That 's druid talk . You find beauty in poetry ; I find it in swords and chariots . And who 's to say your choice is better than mine ? Do n't frown at me like that , Amergin . Hear this : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ierne . Great warriors always need bards to immortalize their victories , and you will have an honored place in my hall . " He spoke easily , giving away nothing that mattered . In his enthusiasm Eremon overlooked the quick angry glitter in Amergin 's eyes . He did not miss seeing Eber Finn , however , who had left his compartmentand was now swaggering around the hall in a new mantle dyed with five colors and bordered with Celtic knotwork . He paraded in front of the women 's balcony , stroking his mustache and exchanging outrageous flattery with a handful of females at once . All seemed to be having a wonderful time . Eremon heard an echo of Colptha 's apparently casual remark the day before : " Eber Finn drives often to the clanhold of Itos . Perhaps he 's thinking of yet another wife . " Eremon turned quickly to Amergin . " There used to be talk about you and Lugaid 's daughter . Do you ever visit her ? " Amergin kept his face carefully closed . " I was n't aware you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am far too busy right now to go hunting women . " " Ai ! " Eremon grinned , relaxing a little . " You , at least , still honor my claim to Taya , then . I 'm glad to know that of you , Amergin . Very glad . " " The honor of a bard is at least as great as that of a warrior , " Amergin said with a sarcasm that flew unnoticed past Eremon , whose mind was already galloping down a new path . He said eagerly , leaning forward to fix Amergin 's attention , " I need you to do something for me . Something a man can ask only of a trusted clansman . You have a polished and persuasive tongue ; I have only a ruin of a voice and the clumsy words men speak to one anotheron a battlefield . Will you go for me to Taya and assure her that I still mean to have her as my wife ? Tell her there is a way for us , I can make it happen , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer in the meantime . " He shot a meaningful glance toward Eber Finn , who had lured one of Etan 's sisters into hanging halfway over the balcony railing and was addressing fulsome compliments to her throat and bosom . The woman 's delighted laughter rang through the hall and Eremon scowled . Amergin hoisted Clarsah onto his shoulder . " I do n't want to get involved with you and your women , " he said . " Please , Amergin , " replied Eremon , who never pleaded with anyone , for anything . " You 're my brother , who else can I ask ? " Only a fool would put himself in such a position , Amergin thought . But we need each other now , if we are to reach lerne . I must not allow a breach to develop between us . " Brother ? " Eremon repeated hopefully . Dawn found Amergin at the cianhold of Itos . Taya met him outside Lugaid 's house and the bard thought he detected a new dignity in her , a measure of inner strength that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amid the bright thunder of the Gaelicians , Taya was a cool and shadowed serenity . And a friend , dearer than a bedmate . He did not want to see her hurt . " Since Krembn is forbidden to see you he has asked me to speak for him , " Amergin explained . " One reason for his great eagerness top264go to Ierne is because he means to take you with him as his wife . He wants to be certain you are aware of this and will wait for him . " A nice , formal little speech , perfectly fulfilling Eremon 's requirements . While he said it , Amergin kept his eyes on the horizon and away from Taya 's face . " I thought the clans for Ierne would be decided by lot , " she said . " How can Eremon be so certain of going ? " " As long as Milesios is head of the tribe , if his sons want to be on the ships to Ierne , I assure you they will be . " Taya drew a deep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric of her blue woolen tunic , a warm winter overgarment coveringthe customary long gown . " Is Ierne cold in the winter ? " she wondered aloud . " We sail north  --  does that mean we will need heavier clothes than these ? " Her words surprised him . " You 'll wait for Eremon ? " " Did you think I would n't ? " " I never thought of you as ... as adventurous , " he said lamely . Taya laughed . " I 'm not . When other girls went to the training ground I hid so they could n't find me , then played house quite happilywith little toys the craftsmen made me . But if Eremon wants me in Ierne , I will go . " The day was raw and bitter . Clouds pregnant with sleet were gatheringover the headland . Amergin felt suddenly desolate , reserving this warm and generous woman for someone who already had a wife to tend his hearthfires and children to remember his name . It was not in him to betray a brother , but neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . Honor allowed both , he thought . Choosinghis words carefully among all the possible disloyalties , he said , " Be certain you know what you 're doing , Taya . Eremon is a hunter by nature and inclination . " " You 're trying to tell me the chase is more important to him than the capture ? I know that already , Amergin . " " Then why . . . " he began , and stopped . She gave him an opaque look . " Even a druid can never know all a woman 's secrets , " she said . " There comes a time when a woman must reach out or start to shrink away . When I reached , Eremon took my hand . It 's as simple as that . " " Nothing is ever that simple , " Amergin replied , looking into himself . Taya studied his face . Deep lines were etched in it like crevices inp265stone , framing a guarded expression the bard never seemed to set aside . " Ai , Amergin , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daring to touch the sacred head of another human because she was now desired and claimed , sure of her place , a person of status . " You worry about me so I will worry about you , " she told the hard . " Who will warm your bed and tend your hearth when we get to Eremon 's island ? " " It is n't Eremon 's island ! " he cried . The sudden passion in his voice made her hand fall from his face as if his skin were on fire . " If Ierne belongs to anyone , " Amergin proclaimed , " she is mine . Bard land , not sword land . Eremon has you , but the harp will claim Ierne ! " Taya was staring at him with shock and sympathy . " Ai , Amergin , you care too much , " she said . " But it is in our blood , I think . " The bard 's blue eyes were very dark behind the coarse hedge of their black lashes . " Yes , " he replied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in our blood . " When he returned to the Mil 's clanhold Eremon came running to meet his chariot . " What did Taya say ? Will she wait for me ? " Amergin busied himself with unharnessing the team , waving away a horseboy who hurried to help . " She 'll wait , " he said in clipped syllables . " Lugaid is hungry for bride gifts , but Taya gave her word she will refuse every man until we are ready to go to Ierne . And as you suggested , she will never mention you in her refusals . " " Why give Odba cause to be suspicious of anything ? " Eremon remarked . " I 'm planning this campaign carefully , Amergin , and I 'm glad I can count on you . I 've always been a remarkably good judge of men . " " I hope you appreciate Taya . " " Of course I do . " " You appreciated Odba until you got used to her , " Amergin remindedhis brother . " That 's different . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression , quite unfamiliar to Eremon 's face , flitted briefly across it , almost as if Colptha peeped for a moment through his eyes . " Tell me , Amergin  --  man to man . Are you certain you did n't allow yourself the pleasure of . . . ah . . . touching Taya , while you were alone with her ? I could hardly blame you ... " " Your trust has become a very fragile thread , " the bard said in a voice as deep and cold as the earth . " One moment you call mep266brother , the next moment you doubt me . We were not raised like that , Eremon . What 's happened to you ? " " I ... I honestly do n't know , " Eremon replied , sounding perplexed . Amergin turned his back on his brother and began reharnessing his team in a silence so heavy it pushed his brother away . The warrior mumbled thanks or farewell or some other trivial comment and went off to find more congenial companions , leaving the bard alone . How easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chariot and drive to Ferdinon 's clanhold . That had been his first intention when he began reharnessing the team . Scena would forgive him his neglect ; he could see her being as firm with him as a mother hound to a wandering puppy , pawing and licking him into the shape she thought proper . She would accept his fever and cool it in her flesh , giving him a brief relief from the forces that drove him . Silencing the voices that called him on the wind . But he would awake , he knew , to inevitable disappointment , with the taste of ashes in his mouth . He could go to her anyway ; he was in the chariot now , the reins in his hands , wheeling the horses toward the gate of the stronghold . He could go to Scena with bride gifts and set out on the sea with a woman of his own at his side , like his warrior brothers . What did it matter if the pattern of her thinking did not fit the pattern of his ? Scena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea voyage and bear strong children on lerne . Perhaps one of them would be a gentle , dreamy boy with the poet 's gift .. . He did not take the road toward Ferdinon 's clanhold as soon as he got out of the gate . Instead , stalling for time in his own mind , Amergindrove out along the headland as he so often did , gazing toward the sea . Imagining a verdant island over the rim of the world , floating in a nimbus of light . His land . His dream . Not that of Itos , nor of Eremon , either ; not a land of sword and spear , but bard land , filled with poetry and music , with time for learning and time for the laughter that surely lurked somewhere inside himself , waiting for release . Bard land , gracious and prosperous . Bard land , where people would bloom like flowers ... the poet 's fancy rambled on , and the horses picked their way along the edge of the cliff unguided . A peculiar sound made them prick their ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reins , listening . It came again  --  ap267moan , perhaps ? A groan of pain ? He could not be sure . He halted the team and listened carefully . A very human sound of anguish floated up to him from the beach below the cliffs . Amergin sprang from his chariot and peered over the edge of the cliff . The day was older than he had realized , already shading into the ice-blue light of a winter evening . He would not have gone to Scena so late in the day anyway , such a long drive .. . And then Scena vanished from his thoughts altogether . He saw a pale figure sprawled on the rocks below , moving with the convulsive jerking motions of an injured animal . But it was no animal . Amergin flung himself over the edge and slithered and slid down the cliff face , not bothering to search out a safe pathway . He reached a narrow strip of beach studded by irregular boulders . A boy lay draped across one of these boulders , his arms awkwardly bent , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then fell back , groaning . Amergin scrambled over the rocks to reach him . " Conmael , is that you ? " He crouched beside the boy and saw that the blood which had run from mouth and nose was crusty , dry . He had been here a long time , then . The increasingly bitter cold of approachingevening had roused him at last , setting him amoan with agony . Amergin swept wet hair back from the youth 's pallid face . The breakers crashing against the shore would soon come high enough to carry his body away altogether . Conmael shuddered and opened his eyes . A wet glisten of fresh blood threaded out the corner of his mouth and down his jaw . " I 'll get you to the stronghold and summon healers , " Amergin promised , but when he tried to lift the boy Conmael shrieked with such anguish the bard almost dropped him . He set Conmael down as carefully as he could and crouched beside him , wondering what to do . The mist of pain cleared briefly and Conmael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if to point upward and tried to say something , but his words were lost in a great choking sob . His eyes closed and his head bobbled loosely on his neck . " No ! " Amergin cried . " This is no way to die , lad ; listen to me ! Open your eyes ! " Then he looked from Conmael to the cliff above , following the boy 's aborted gesture . From the headland a person world have to he hurled far outward to strike the rocks at the edge of the surf . Stich a fall could not be accidental.  | " Were you thrown , Conmael ? " Amergin asked , and thought he detected a faint negative shake of the head . Perhaps . Perhaps not . " Did you jump ? " he asked next . But Conmael was forever beyond answering . Amergin had to carry the uninhabited body far down the beach before he found a way to get back up the cliff with his burden . When he reached the top his chariot was gone . In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already returned to the stronghold , anxious to be unharnessed and fed . The bard had a long and lonely walk through the twilight , carrying ruined youth in his arms.  |p269COLPTHA  MOURNED THE DEATH of his foster son with extravagantceremony , filling the tomb with funeral gifts and bestowingstill more on Gosten 's clan , until he far exceeded the dead boy 's honor price . But then for a time he failed to attend rituals in the nemeton ; he neglected to come to the Heroes ' Hall for feasts . " Is it possible our brother grieves ? " Eber Finn asked Amergin . " I would not have thought him capable of it . " " I suspect we do not know just what Colptha is capable of , " Amergin replied carefully . " But I mean to find out . He is part of us . " Gosten was upset about the loss of his son . " I can not imagine himjust jumping off a cliff ! " he said to anyone who would listen . " Perhaps he was clumsy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon sick , like Ir , and thought he could fly , " saidanother . " Do you believe that , Amergin ? " Gosten wanted to know . " No , " the bard replied . Only Sakkar offered a clue about Conmael 's death , but it was a s-nall one , an obscure signpost buried in the boy 's own character and remarked only by a curious turn of phrase ; a clue found in words by a bard who paid very close attention to words . " Conmael was unhappy , no matter what the sacrificer claims , " Sakkar told Amergin . " Several times he started to talk to me about it and then drew back . Once he said he had brought a dishonor on himself he would not outlive in nine lives . " " What dishonor could a half-grown boy commit ? " Sakkar studied his fingernails . " I do not know . It was his private grief . But he reminded me of a trapped animal , like the ones vendors wll in cages in Tyre to he used as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amergin shuddered . " You knew Conmael , " he said . " Yes , master . "  | " How many times must I remind you that I am not your master ? None of my tribe acknowledges another as master ; we each contain the same share of the great spirit . But to get back to Conmael  --  would he have killed himself for any reason , do you think ? " Sakkar picked up a small wooden ship , a careful replica of a Phoenician forty-oared galley . " I began this to give your carpenters a pattern , " he explained , " because teaching meant for the hands enters most easily through the eyes . Conmael watched me for a time , then begged to be taught how to do it . He proved more skilled than I at putting together all these little pieces and he was so proud of his accomplishment . But it is not yet finished , as you can see . " As a craftsman myself , I know this : Conmael would not have deliberatelyleaped out of life before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . . . " Amergin mused . " Yes . He had no abrasionsfrom rolling down the slope . Only his bones were injured , brokento pieces in the sack of his skin . And I found him lying almost two spear lengths beyond the overhang of the cliff . Yet you are right , he would not have sought transition before this little ship was finished , for I can see for myself the love and care he was putting into it . " When the galley was finished we planned to make a prototype of the smaller boats , which will be much more numerous . Hide-covered boats I am designing myself , somewhat based on a variety of Egyptianvessel . There is much more leather in this territory than timber . Conmael would have worked on those , too , " Sakkar said sadly . " I was counting on him . " " We must all rely on one another if we are to get to Ierne , " Amerginsaid . " A man alone could not make it , I think . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sakkar the shipwright . A whole tribe working together , looking out for each other . And I am . . . almost . . . part of it . A tribe with no masters . Having committed themselves to the course , the Gaelicians laboredunstintingly . While Amergin worked on his epic and puzzled over the death of Conmael , both warriors and freemen were scouring the region for timber and enlarging their tanning pits to treat countlesshides . Soon the stench of curing leather hung on the cold winter air like a nauseating pall . At the Imbolc festival that celebrated the lactating of the ewes Milesios requested the druid n-easr-rers to take a head count of thep271tribe , but put off having the clans draw lots to determine who would go , in spite of constant pressure to do so . He told Scotta , " As long as the outcome is not certain , every man expects to have a place in a boat and therefore works on the boats to his best ability . There are always a few feckless ones who might grow careless if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Everyone will benefit , " Scotta said . " Those who stay behind will have twice as much land and most of the adult livestock , for Eber Finn has pointed out we must take only the youngest , smallest animalsin order to save room . Calves and colts , lambs , weanlings . " " We , Scotta ? " Milesios laughed . " Of course we 're going ! Do you intend to miss this opportunity now that you 're yourself again ? As for me , I must go with my childrenbecause they will never do anything properly if left to them-selves . " She radiated the blazing energy that pulsed through the entire tribe . Excitement was a leaping flame and the Gaelicians were consurnedby it ; hot and hungry . Only Milesios held back , but he did not want the others to see this . As quickly as his vigor returned it had begun to ebb away again , leaving him feeling older and wearier than ever . He had set so much in motion , but now , contemplating it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part . He just wanted to lie down and go to sleep . And then one morning he did not get up at all . Scotta rose as usual in the half-light before dawn to awaken the fire and bring some of yesterday 's bread from the bakehouse for the morning 's meal . She bustled around in the quiet , enjoying a sense of being the only person in a private universe . Milesios lay with his back toward her , not even snoring for a change . Nothing disturbed the silence except the clucks and rustlings of the domestic fowl in their boxes . ' I'oo much silence . Just before the fire found its voice and began to crackle Scotta cocked her head , listening intently . She heard the wind beyond the door and a herder calling to his wife , but nothing else . No sound from Milesios at all . She felt a strange disinclination to approach him . The distance between her hearth and his bedhox was a journey across worlds . Twice she started toward hinr ; twice she stopped . She deliberately struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal clang but her husband neither twitched nor snorted . I am being foolish , she said to herself . I will get back into bed beside him and pull the covers over my head , and after a little more sleep we will awake together as we have for so many seasons . She took her nerve in both hands and got into the bed , willing the future to be as she expected it . She was a brave woman , but never so brave as at this moment . She settled herself in the nest she had left , a nest now chill because the Mil 's body had not kept it warm . She turned her back to his , not touching , and lay there with wide eyes , staring across the room . I am asleep . I will wake up soon . The wind blew harder and she heard a cart go rumbling by , close to her door . The clan was awake and at work . The chief and his wife must be awake , too . She got up very slowly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did not look around at him . His skin felt unfamiliar to her fingers . There was no life in it . Scotta dropped her head and closed her eyes , her hand still on him . " You have gone down your new road without me after all , " she said at last into the terrible silence . She sat and Milesios lay beside her . Her heart beat , her lungs expandedand emptied , and his did not . A large spider emerged from the thatch and made its way down the roof pillar , crawling purposefullytoward some spiderish goal . The motion caught Scotta 's eye and she watched as if there were nothing else in the world to see . Nothingelse in the world to do . She had outlived and helped bury the Mil 's other women ; she had raised children for him and honored him and always considered herselfthe indispensable half of a team . Now there was no team . One horse alone does not pull a chariot . " This is the pit at the bottom of my life , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever be worse than this . " Some part of her brain took comfort from the words . Eber , coming to get his mother to settle some petty dispute between his women , found the Mil and his wife together in their silence . Eber stripped off his cloak and wrapped it and his arms around Scotta , who was trembling . But her eyes were dry . " He must have a splendid tomb , " was all she said . " He was the champion . "  |p273Sleet  drummed on the roof ; beads from a broken string . Winter was death 's season . The tomb of Milesios was indeed fitting for a chieftain and a champion . His untenanted body was placed on a bronze bed made in the form of a high-backed bench , supported by eight metal figures of women balanced acrobatically over functional wheels of iron and bronze . The smiths of the Gaelicians outdid themselves in their final , elegant tribute to a great man . And as the tomb was about to be sealed , Eremon caught one last glimpse of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendid belt of the champion fastened around his waist for all eternity . " Now we will never contest for it , " Eremon said regretfully . Eber Finn frowned at him . " That belt belongs with the Mil ; it was his highest honor . " " Would you not like to have fought me for it ? " Eber considered the question gravely . " No , " he said at last . " That was a mistake , " Colptha said to him under his breath . " You could have defeated Eremon ; you could have had that belt for your-self . " Colptha in his misery longed to see unhappiness on every other face as well . He did indeed grieve for Conmael ; his nightmares were haunted with images of Conmael smashed on the rocks . The bloody rocks . The thirsty Earth Mother , drinking , taking at last the sacrifice she had cried for with her open and gaping mouths . Now he saw the true meaning of that earlier vision . It was not rain the Mother demanded . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had turned their backs on him and refused to listen . Irial had forced him to keep silent . But Irial could not silence him now , now that he truly understood . Now that the Earth Mother had truly revealed herself to him alone by taking Conmael from him in even exchange for the gift of divine wisdom . His people had underestimated him . Very well . What others thought and felt did not rnatter to him anymore , because there was no one left alive who mattered to him . Colptha saw himself as alone in the world and with terrible bravado , he laughed . Coldly , darkly , inside himself , the sacrificer laughed . Ile no longer had ( ; onrnael to send through the tribe , carrying rumors and dropping hints , so he redoubled his own efforts to en/courage the election of Donn as chief of the tribe before the druids finally selected their own leader . And to give himself a little added pleasure he also redoubled his efforts to set his brothers against each other . Just for the satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every man feel alone . Colptha 's partisanship had become open and obvious and Donn resented it . He felt he was being pushed and said so to Eremon . " I do n't want you to think I 'm trying to crowd you out , " he explained . " As oldest , I will be clan-chief after Scotta and that 's all the responsibilityI want . Truly . If any of the Mil 's sons should lead the tribe that man is you ... " " What about me ? " Eber Finn demanded , thrusting himself into the conversation . He had become intensely aware that Eremon 's followingseemed larger and more vociferous than his own . Colptha never failed to point that out to him . " We are cattle lords again , " Eber said , " and I have the most talent with animals . I should be chief of the tribe ! " Donn looked from one to the other . His brothers were almost as alike as two calves born in one sac ; big and brawny and high-colored . A strong rivalry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . It was as if a new element had been added , an underlyingmeanness turning mirror images against each other . Maybe things really will be better on Ierne , Donn thought hopefully . Where there is enough for all . Ierne . The elders and clan representatives met and argued long over the council fires . The brehons arbitrated the inevitable quarrels late into the night . When the sun rose , Eremon , gritty-eyed , returned to his house and fell across his bed . " Is it over ? " Odba asked eagerly . " It 's over . Ferdinon is chief of the Gaelicians . " Odba 's jaw dropped . " How could that happen ? " " My supporters wanted me , Eber 's friends yelled for him , there was a strong vote for Donn and a slightly lesser one for Gosten . No one could agree . In the end we were all so tired we had to make a choice , any choice . Ferdinon is popular with almost everybody and has a clanhold of sons to speak for his virility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hope we 're not all enemies in the morning . " He sank at once into an exhausted sleep , leaving ( ) dba staring at him with her hands on her hips.  |p275Col|ptha  the sacrificer was sick with anger . Ferdinon , of all people ! Ferdinon owed Colptha no debts and was singularly resistant to persuasion . Furthermore , like his predecessor , he had no desire to take part in druid affairs . The sun would forget to rise before Ferdinonwould use his new influence on Colptha 's behalf . Colptha dug his nails into the palms of his hands in impotent fury . But he was not impotent . He was a druid , chosen and favored by the spirits . This was a riddle they were posing him , a test to make him stronger . The other sons of Milesios were experiencing other anxieties . With the Mil dead , they could no longer be assured of places among the colonizers . Now they were just another clan instead of privileged members of the chieftain 's family . " It 's your fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't insisted on arguing so much I would have been chosen at the start and the leadershipwould have remained in our line . " " I had a right to be heard ! " Eber told him . " And I would have made a better leader than you ; ask Colptha . He told me so himself . " He gestured toward the sacrificer , who was just entering the hall . Colptha came to Eber 's beckoning , but he was in a dark mood indeedand would not give anyone else fat meat to eat while he had to suck on bones . " Now that it no longer matters , " he said , " I tell you both that I do n't think either one of you could have taken the Mil 's place . Perhaps you 'd better wait until we get to Ierne and fight over that , since fighting is the only real talent you have . You are smallheaded , both of you . " Donn stepped between them before either Eremon or Eber com -- iiitted the grave offense of striking a druid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donn wanted to know . " Donn the conciliator , " Colptha sneered . He need not court I ) onn 's favor now ; he could show his contempt for such a boring , stolid fellow . " Who would you put on the chieftain 's bench , Donn ? Surely not yourself ; that was obvious from the way you refused to fight for it . Maybe you would have chosen Ir , just to avoid having t rouble with him . You lack the manhood to fight for anything , Donn . That 's why you sire only daughters . " Donn was too astonished to reply . At the next ritual gathering of the druids 011ach said , " Ten nights from the first new moon of ( ) ester , the patterns of earth and sky will be in a powerful conjunction . If each of us with the power of divina/tion goes off alone , away from the unsettling atmosphere still lingeringin the grove , perhaps the spirits will speak to us and guide our choice . " The druids agreed . They were as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the earnest desire to make the right choice burned in every face . No eyes burned more brightly than those of Colptha the sacrificer . Now was his time ; now ! Meanwhile , strange skeletons were being assembled in sheltered coves . Wooden frames propped and braced on the sand resembled huge beached sea-animals , imbued with a half-life of expectation in- stead of the stench of decay . When the weather permitted the boatbuildersto work Amergin came almost daily with Clarsah , to sing the merry music for them and speed their hands . The other Gaelicians crowded to the scene as well , to admire the construction of the few timbered galleys and exclaim over the clevernessof the more numerous hide boats . Ribs and framework for these grew under the boatbuilders ' hands , waiting for the sewn hides that would form the outer shell . The tanned hides were painstakingly stretched and fitted , then all seams were thoroughly greased with fat to serve as waterproofing . Sakkar did much worrying about the masts and sails for the hide boats , finallydeciding on hardwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the voyage will be into the wind and against the tide , " he explained to his crew . " We will need sails that will not tear but are light enough to be taken down easily when they start to work against us . At that time every man in the boat must take to the oars . " The masts were rigged with shrouds and forestays and the hulls were reinforced with a timber stem , keel , and deadwood . Oars were fitted and shaped , then patiently smoothed so they would not tear the hands with splinters . Sakkar took groups of men out , a few at a time , and instructed them in sail management and the techniques of rowing . The Phoenician was enjoying the project . He was beginning to feel like a captain , or perhaps even a commander , with so many aspects of the voyage under his supervision . He started to swagger a bit when he walked . " That Sakkar thinks he 's a Gaelician now , " the women commentedto each other , watching him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He wears a saffron tunic like a freeman these days , and since the samodhii healed his shoulder he has a rather harmonious form . " " He 's an interesting enough man for a woman who does n't want much , " another commented . " He 's little  --  but those dark eyes are most exotic , do n't you agree ? I suppose he might welcome a pleasant chat with a woman from time to time ; he must be rather lonely here . " " You 're just curious to know if Phoenicians are made like other men ! " Sakkar knew they were watching him and assumed some of their giggling was about him , but he did not mind . He did more than copy the Celtic way of walking ; he shaved off his beard and grew as full a mustache as he could , and with Amergin 's permission he had begun wearing bits of jewelry the bard did not care for . As chief bard of the tribe , Amergin received more gifts in return for his services than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of Conmael , or of his dead wife and child , and buried his face in his hands and allowed himself a few tears . He had learned that Celts did not scorn tears as being unmanly . He had also found them to be openhanded and tolerant . Their socialclasses were sharply delineated yet divided without prejudice . Though he was considered a laborer , he had the same rights under Celtic law as a member of the warrior aristocracy . He also had an honor price , a set figure indicating his worth to the community . As Findbar the brehon explained it to him , Sakkar the shipwright was worth six cows , a most respectable sum . " If someone killed you they would have to pay an eric to the Milesianclan of six cows , since I suppose you are to be considered a member of the Mil 's family now , " Findbar said . Sakkar , who had grown up as a wharf rat on the docks of Tyre , had never expected to have a tangible value , a rock of pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmured to himself as he worked , " Six cows . " And smiled beneath his growing mustache . He felt increasingly at home in the Gaelician world now that his lx ) athuilding operation had become a full-scale industry . Familiar noise and bustle shaped his days . Countless shallow pans of seawater sat in the sun , their moisture evaporating to leave a residue of salt for meat preservation . Therep278was much meat to be preserved . The sacrificers were kept busy propitiatingthe spirits of cattle to be slaughtered , explaining to the gaunt animals the need for leather hides to cover the hide boats . The cattle must not be allowed to resent their deaths , but must acquiesce to them as part of the endless circle of survival . As soon as the hides were removed they were rushed to lime pits to soften the hair , which was then scraped off by children Sakkar had trained to use special double-handled scrapers . Next the hides went into the tanning pits , holes dug in the earth and filled with a darkbrown , creamy-foamed mixture of oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in this brew , the sickly sweet smell pervading the atmosphere until no one bothered to comment on it anymore . The strongest men and women hauled the soaked hides from the pits and worked wool grease into them by hand . Now the stench could not be ignored , and the grease-rubbers wrapped cloths around their faces to turn back the worst of it . The druids assembled on the appointed day . The diviners came one by one from their various solitudes , where they had gone to await the guidance of the spirits . Some had new wisdom in their eyes . Some had only the disappointment a man must endure from time to time . One looked desperate . They gathered to chant beneath the great trees and whisper the great names , connecting themselves with the forces of creation and letting the power of life flow through them . They recited in turn whatever experiences had been given them . The stories they told were complex and obscure , yet each man who had received a vision found an arrow in it , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredulously . He had lain in a cold , dank cave , shivering more from passion than chill , and used the considerable strength of his mind to try to force the pattern to fit his desire . He had concentrated so intently on this he would not have heard the true voices of the spirits if they had spoken to him . Others had heard them , however . " It is clear to us that 011ach is best prepared to lead the order , " Corisios said , speaking for his fellows . " The samodhii have seen it in the stars , the dreamers have dreamed it beside the tombs . We have heard one man 's vision of a sun-dappled meadow and 011ach is still dappled with freckles , like a child . Another discovered a mighty river flowing across the heavens and Ollach lives on the banks of a river of the same configuration . A third dreamed of seven trees with seven branches , and ( ) llach is thep279seventh son of a seventh son , a powerful symbol in itself . The pieces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we fit them together as Ollach , the samodhi . " " What about me ? " Colptha protested . " I was given a special warning from the Earth Mother herself , about the cattle ! " " Your vision was clouded , " Corisios told him . " The cattle tore up the land and went hungry , but leaf-spring has come and the grass is returning . And we find we need every cow we have to furnish hides for the boats . Amergin and his Phoenician shipwright have turned a calamity into an opportunity . " Ollach said , " I have often thought that Irial , if he had lived , would have named the bard his successor . Perhaps he would still be the best choice ... " " No ! " Colptha cried . " Anyone but ... I mean , the spirits have made their decision and it is you , 011ach . We accept with grace . " The sacrificer 's mouth flooded with acid as he said those words . To have worked so hard and dared so much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crushing blow . But at least the hands were not those of Amergin. 011ach bowed his head in true humility . " I accept the will of the spirits , " he said . The ritual of ordination must be held in the same place where the former chief druid had left his life ; that is the Law . 011ach would lie prostrate at the foot of the oak and endure the trials of flame and water and earth , giving the spirits every chance to strike him down if he was not their true choice . Colptha had one small comfort . At least he would not have to lie naked and vulnerable where Irial 's body had lain . Meanwhile the work on the boats continued . Teaching a shipwright 's skills to so many landmen was not an easy task , and Sakkar was having to discover depths of patience within himself he had not known he possessed . It was soon obvious the boats would not be ready in time to sail on the next summer tide , which meant they would have to wait another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the north to realize the voyage could be made only in spring or summer . The terrible autumnal storms along the Gaulish coast would turn Phoenician galleys hack ; what chance would hide boats have against such weather ? I le went to the Heroes ' 1 Tall to explain this to Ferdinon . Sakkarp280was dressed in a fresh tunic and a cloak of scarlet wool . His mustache was dark and flat instead of golden and heavy , but at least he had one . Every man in the hall was taller than he but he stood erect and looked Ferdinon straight in the eye , as no Tyrian shipwright would have dared to look at the king of Tyre . He might have been mistaken for a short , dark Gaelician if it had not been for his beaked nose . Ferdinon was distressed over his news . " Next leaf-spring , you say ? The people will be in desperate shape by then , I 'm afraid . They have been unusually patient already , and they want to go now . They need to go now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have enough tall hardwood for the frames and keels of four big galleys , which we will plank with pine , but the work can not be rushed . And there are many hide boats still to be completed if you want vessels for half the tribe . But we can start training crews in the boats we have ; it will make the voyage seem that much closer . " Ferdinon agreed ; he had no choice . But he dreaded having to tell his tribesmen that the season of departure was pushed back , over the horizon and out of sight . The tribe 's good will was worn thin , eroded by bad weather and starving cattle . In her new and permanent seat in the women 's balcony , Scena Dullsaine murmured to Dil , " Now Amergin will have yet another excuse to put off asking for me . He is balkier than a bull calf about choosing a wife to take to Ierne . " " None of us is that certain of going to Ierne anymore , " Dil remindedher . " Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships than anyone else . Uncertainty is a sword over our heads . " " I detest uncertainty , " Scena replied . " I prefer to make my own decisions without waiting on someone else 's whim . I am a Celt , after all . My life is my own . " She tossed her head and let her bold eyes roam over the warriors assembled in the Heroes ' Hall . " Since Ferdinon and his closest clansmen came here to occupy the tribal stronghold and lead the Gaelicians , I have done nothing but stumble over Milesians , " Scena went on . " We are all crowded in here together like too many sheep in a pen . If I were to go to some man 's house as his wife , at least I would have more room . " She saw Caicher 's brother looking at her and looked back , arching her spine a little , making promises with her eyes . " I am tired of waiting for Amergin , " she told Dil frankly . " The bard is wrapped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that thinking , all those ideas . . . they get in the way . He has a world of his own with no place for me in it , and that harp guards the gate to his stronghold . " I like a man who laughs louder than the bard does , and laughs more often . I like a man who takes life as it comes to him instead of expecting something of it . " " So  --  will you marry someone else at the next festival of Bealtaine ? " Dil inquired . Scena shrugged . " I will do as I please , " was all she would say. o+The season of warmth and light had come at last ; the season of birth and growth . Oester wore her brightest face and it seemed that all wives  --  except Odba had prayers for fertility answered . The need for new land had never been more apparent . The chief bard was frequently summoned to the sides of women in labor , to prepare a harmonious atmosphere for the infant 's arrival . Poetry should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law . He stood beside Un 's young wife when she bore her latest child and watched its emerging face . In the baby 's wizened , toothless countenance the bard glimpsed both past and future ; the ancient visagethe spirit had worn at the end of its last life and the equally old face it would show the world on some distant day of transition . For a brief moment , Amergin thought he saw the spirit itself in that enduring , changeless mask of wisdom , wrinkled and bright-eyed , a joyousgnome indifferent to flesh yet lusty for each new stage of existence . As Amergin watched , the intelligence within the infant began to discover once more what it felt like to be new , to be young . The tiny mouth opened and sucked in air to inflate the minuscule lungs . A cry , hardly more than a squeak , emerged , and almost immediately the flesh began to plump out , the wrinkles to soften and fade . Soon the child would resemble every other baby , a little lump of pink clay waiting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of birth and age that the face of the spirit within could sometimes be seen , arrivingfrom or launching out on the voyage between lives . Amergin bowed his head before the recurring miracle and stroked Clarsah , who sang a welcome to the child . Arnergin 's thoughts flickered backward to another child , one who had left this life too early , with the best part of it yet before him . Inp282his memory he found a clear picture of Conmael 's broken body on the beach . When he left Un 's clanholding he drove thoughtfully back to the headland . Everywhere he looked he saw new shoots of heartbreakinglytender green ; grass and bud and leaf , springing into life . Living , growing beings , certain of their place on the wheel of the seasons , sure of their destiny of flowering and fulfillment . Amergin wandered to the far side of the headland , to a spot he had not visited since Conmael 's death . He looked northward , expecting the green wind on such a verdant day , but the air was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shady niche a little way down the cliff face and eased himself down into it , bracing his back comfortablyagainst the vertical earth and gazing out at the sea . Ierne . " Amergin ? Is that you down there ? " He looked up to see Colptha peering down at him from the edge of the cliff . " Finding you here is a sign from the spirits , " the sacrificer said . " They always guide me , you know . Always . " His eyes had a hectic gleam . " Since you and I are both here , and I see you have your harp  --  play a eulogy for my foster son , bard . I will give you a fine gift for it . " " You did not request a eulogy from me during his funeral ritual . " " That was a hard day for me . I ... I do not think I could have borne to listen . But compose one now , will you ? The boy deserves it , Amergin . " The bard looked up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " he agreed . " Conmael surely deserves it . " Easing Clarsah from her case , he closed his eyes and sang . The eulogycame easily , a celebration of Conmael 's youth and energy , his open , trusting nature , his obedience and nimble fingers and oncebrightspirit . The poem was not one of the classic compositions a bard would create to commemorate a deified hero , but there was a sweetness to it like the curve of the dead boy 's mouth . A mournful , tender music , occasionally dappled with merriment like freckles on a Celtic face . When Clarsah hummed the last note and Amergin looked up , he saw that Colptha was crying.  |p283SLINGING  THE HARP over his shoulder by her carrying-thong , Amergin scrambled up to join Colptha . The sacrificer was definitelyweeping . Bitter tears welled up and spilled onto his cheeks . He glared angrily at Amergin , as if ashamed to be seen with his emotion . " You honor Conmael by crying for him , " Amergin assured Colptha . " You did n't think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , I remember your crying . You frequently did it when one of us defeated you in a contest . But you did n't mourn your loss at the Mil 's tomb and I did n't expect to see you grieve over losing Con-mael . " " You have a low opinion of me , do n't you ? " Colptha 's flow of tears dried up but his expression remained angry . " I am constantly revising my opinion of you , " Amergin told him . " If you truly mourn Conmael ... " " Iff " Colptha flung back his head so a strand of lank yellow hair lifted briefly like a cock 's comb . " You ca n't begin to understand how I felt about that boy , Amergin . You ca n't imagine how I suffer when I see his empty stool , or the bowl he drank his wine from . His cloaks still hang on pegs in my house . He admired me . That may be a little thing to the great bard , but it meant a lot to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked late into the night , or he laughed at some little jest of mine . . . " The sacrificer 's tone lost its customary cutting cdge . For a moment his eyes were gentle with memories summoned from deep inside himself by the bardic gift . With words and music Aruergin had reached into Colptha 's inner darkness and plucked out all the beauty that remained there ; wrenching it loose , painfully . Raw . Bleeding .. . The terrible gift of the hard.  |p284Tenderness  dissolved in fury . " You would n't understand ! " Colptha raged at Amergin . " You ca n't love anything but that harp ! " Amergin took the verbal blow without flinching , but the watchful sacrificer saw something flicker in the bard 's eyes and marked it down . That momentary expression revealed a sore point , a weakness to be exploited . A way to cause pain to balance the pain that continuallyate at Colptha . Amergin 's eulogy had released the pain , and with it came pouring all the hatred dammed up behind it . Colptha stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quivered with intensity , seeming to swell like a pustule about to break open and spill its poison on the clean wind . " Do n't look at me like that , as if you 're trying to understand me ! " Colptha shrieked . " You could never understand me , any of you . The sons of the great Champion , strutting around , so sure of yourselves . He bragged about every one of you at some time or the other . About all his sons  --  but me . Eremon and Eber Finn , his sword and spear . That 's what he called them . And the rest of you named me the Swordsman behind my back , and laughed . Did you think I did n't know that ? I knew , all right . Even then I had druid ears , I knew I was ridiculed for my weakness and my lack of grace . As if muscle and bone really mattered ! " And Ir  --  physical perfection . I hated to be seen anywhere near him because he made me look positively deformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only the eldest but could do anything he set his hand to , and do it well . It might take him a while , but when he finished a task it was correctly done and he was respected for it . No one laughed at Donn . " And you , Amergin  --  you most of all . You think you see some kinship between us ? You try with cruel flattery to spread your mantleof honor so it includes me ? The great bard Amergin ! Men fear your curses and offer high prices for your praise songs . How does it feel , Amergin , to have people staring at you with admiration whereveryou go ? " Colptha seemed to envision a personage so unlike Amergin 's own view of himself that the bard could only shake his head . " Would you have me apologize for my talent , Colptha ? Would it make you feel better if I admitted to you that the gift is more the harp 's than mine ? " He paused , stunned by the naked emotion he saw on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . " You actually hate me , do n't you ? " Arnergin whispered.  | " Yes ! " the sacrificer hissed . His hands curved into clawed talons and he half-lifted them as if to strike . To rend , to tear . . . The admissionwas a relief . And it was safe ; Amergin never informed on a clansman , he would never repeat this conversation to his own brother 's discredit . " Yes , I despise you , Amergin ! For the sake of all those more deserving of honors , I despise you . In the name of all those who want to be great but never will , I despise you ! " Amergin was sickened . " Listen to yourself , Colptha ! Have you forgotten the lessons we learned as boys in the sacred groves ? Whatevertalent one person has is not his property alone . All spirits are part of One , you know that . And of each other . So my gift is to your credit as much as it is to mine ; I 'm only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flows through me but it originates in the wellspring of creation that is the source of us all . When you strike out at someone else 's achievement you are attackingyour own share of a great gift . " " There is no gift the equal of mine , " Colptha said in a flat voice . " And you have no share in it . None ! The spirits gave me a vision but you all rejected it , so I have no further obligation to share with any of you . " " What are you talking about ? " The fanatic light in Colptha 's eyes rnade Amergin uneasy . They were standing very near the edge of the cliff where Conmael had died , and the sea was crashing below , beatingagainst the rocks . " I shared what I had with Conmael , " Colptha went on , seemingly unable to halt the flow of his words . " But even he finally rejected me . " He followed the direction of Amergin 's glance ; down , down . There were dried stains on Colptha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Looking at them , Amergin felt the last knot of the puzzle dissolve . " Yes , Conmael rejected you , " the bard said aloud . " But he did n't deliberately kill himself . And you did n't kill him . " The druid 's eye saw , unclouded . Colptha was startled . " Did you think I did ? Do you think that littleof me , Amergin ? " " I thought it was a distinct possibility . You would have killed anyone who threatened to expose your viciousness . " " Expose me ? How ? " " Con mac was carrying a burden too heavy for him , but he was too young to have done anything very terrible  --  unless he helped you in sonic way . And what awful thing could you have clone that wouldp286drive a child to despair ? " Amergin very carefully stepped away from the cliff edge before he went on . " You killed Irial , Colptha . When I realized you were capable of doing that , I thought you could also have killed your little assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , leaped out of life , ' and you are not strong enough to have flung that boy as far out as he fell . " Conmael really did leap out of life , I believe . But not on purpose . He was upset and desperate , but he was also young and resilient and had an incentive to stay in this life . I think Conmael struck the rocks so far out because he ran off this cliff , Colptha . Running in blind panic , as deer sometimes run right into a pack of hounds . I think he finally could not bear his burden any longer and just ran from you heedlessly , as fast as he could . He probably did n't even realize he was at the edge of the cliff until there was no ground beneath him . But he struck the rocks free , no longer enslaved by you . " Conmael died nobly , in full possession of himself as a Celt should be , and I am proud to have sung his eulogy . " Colptha had stared open-mouthed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deny it , not to another druid who could see what lay beneath the surface . He merely said , " Are you prepared to formally accuse me of murdering Irial ? " " I have no proof , and the brehons would insist on proof , even from a fellow druid . Besides , the spirits have taken the matter into the invisibleworld and will redress the balance there . It 's out of our hands . " " Then why make these accusations against me now ? To lord it over me once more , Amergin ? How typical of a son of the Mil ! " " I told you all this to warn you off . There is something terrible eating at you , Colptha , something that deforms not the body but the spirit . " Amergin looked over the sacrificer 's shoulder , facing into the green wind . " I do n't want you going to Ierne to infect a new land with your hatreds . " Colptha 's eyes lit with icy fire . " What makes you think you can stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I should even go as chief druid , if the tribe of 011ach stays here . " " Never ! " " Ai , but you would not raise your hand against a brother to stop me , would you ? You can accuse me of murder , Amergin , but the passionto kill is not in you , so you have no real weapon against me . I think if any of us goes to Ierne , I will . " His thin lips curled with cruel arm isenwnt . " If you want to stopp287someone , why do n't you stop Eremon ? With him out of the way you might at last stand a chance at that ripe little Taya . Ai ! Yes ! You felt that spear , did n't you ? You are vulnerable , bard . " The sacrificer spun on his heel and walked away . Amergin stared after him . Colptha had gone only a few steps before he turned and indulged in one final attack . " All you have is your poetry , bard . No woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one the spirits love and reward , the one who should lead our people on Ierne . I was chosen , Amergin , and you can not stop me now . No one can ! " The green wind moaned around Amergin , playing a mournful note on the harp in his numbed hand . Le , " I have to lead the expedition to Ierne , " Eremon was fuming to his good friend Brego . " With Milesios gone I 'm the obvious choice ; it was my idea in the first place . " Honesty tapped him on the shoulder . " I mean I was one of the first to suggest it , " he amended . " The clan of Milesios may have to stay here , " Brego reminded him . " It all depends on the drawing of lots . " " They should have been drawn yesterday ; then at least we 'd know . I hate this waiting ! " Eremon cried in frustration , downing his fifth bowl of wine that afternoon . Afternoon , evening , morning , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solstices . The remaining cattle sought what nourishment they could from the partially recovered land , but they were still very thin . The spirit of the Gaelicians was wearing thin as well , as they threw all their resources behind the twin efforts of survivaland preparing the ships . Colptha found it increasingly easy  --  and amusing  --  to stir up quarrels between men balanced on the ragged edge of their nerves . A whisper here , a repetitive murmur there , and soon no man would trust another . They would have no one left to trust but the spirits , and Colptha the druid would speak for the spirits . On Ierne . Amergin the bard moved among his people , heartening , encouraging , his active eye seeing their fears and weaknesses and his bardic gift singing them into strengths . He worked like a man obsessed to hold on to the dream ; to keep it from being lost in the daily tatters of their lives . He seemed too busy for women ; too busy for Scena Dullsaine ,  |p288though  there were times when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the songs of the north wind . The second winter set in , more savage than its predecessor . Wind howled . Sleet slashed . Ferdinon heard the tragic story of an outlying clan that had been forced to eat its seed bull and now was without either cattle or future . Food was rushed to them from the stores within the stronghold , but those stores were dwindling . The new chieftain could not possibly feed his entire tribe . " Things will be all right once we set sail for Ierne , " the Gaelicians told one another grimly . Eremon sought to cling to the same consolation . As long as Ierne was on his horizon , however distant , he found he could even view Odba with a certain degree of tolerance . He spent more time in his house , letting her chatter at him . Hostility lessened between them and Odba began humming to herself as she bent over the cooking pots . Amergin could not resist asking about her ; worrying about her . " Odba is n't such an awful woman , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her if she 'd be reasonable about Taya . You 'd think she would welcome having another woman to share the work . " Eremon heaved a great sigh . " It 's a pity , Amergin . I 'm used to Odba , I like the way she makes my clothes , I even like the way her food tastes when she is n't angry with me . These past nights , I have begun to remember how it was when she first came into my house . " " I think your eye is wandering again , " Amergin commented . That night Odba looked up from her chores to see her husband watching her with a pleasant expression on his face , and she offered him half a smile in return . Eremon was suddenly reminded how long it had been since he embraced a woman . He patted his knee . " Come here , " he said . The boys were asleep . The fire burned low on the hearth . After a moment 's hesitation , Odba settled into Eremon 's arms and nestled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he had almost forgotten . His hands wandered over her body and she made a small purring noise in her throat , wriggling to fit more closely against him . When they woke together the next morning , Odba turned her head and gave Eremon a long-lidded , languorous glance , then twisted to stretch voluptuously . Every part of her body felt well used and contented . Everything will be all right now , she thought . I:rc-nom will he a husband to me ; he realizes at last what an excellent wife I am.  |p289Her  cheeks dimpled as she recalled the pleasures of the night . And this would be the first of many such times ; from now on she would be doubly careful to do everything as Eremon wished it , keeping him as pleased as he looked this morning . Her wonderful Eremon . . . all any woman could wish for .. . There was just one fly in the milk . Her enemy , though defeated , was not discredited . It was important that Taya have no strength left . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or perhaps a girl this time , " she murmured to Eremon as she stroked his shoulder . " I only have one small worry . What if Lugaid 's spiteful daughter has put a curse on my womb to keep it barren ? She is mean , Eremon ; I 've alwaysseen it in her , and I ask you to protect me . " Eremon cried a savage oath and flung himself from the bed . When Odba fixed the sunset meal he still had not returned . He had spent a long and bitter day at the harbor , feeling all the old angers against his wife boiling up again . He watched the boatbuilderswork , urging them to greater speed , and even saw old Itos among them , toothless and shaky but so consumed with excitement that he came every day to help . " Ierne is burning the life out of him , " Donn remarked . " No one thinks he could survive the journey even if his clan is chosen , but he thinks of nothing else . " " My wife accuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I think Ierne is the source of sorcery , reaching across the water and drawing us all . " He gazed moodily at the vessels spread along the beach . Eber Finn claimed the boats were as beautiful as seabirds , but Eremon was not looking for beauty . The fine curved sheer and long lifting bows that would enable them to rise and ride over rough seas meant nothing to him . He just wanted to see them launched and himself in one . Waiting in rows on the sand they reminded him of so many braces of coursing hounds , eager to be off and running . In spite of the winter seas , Sakkar began urging all the able-bodied Gaelicians to familiarize themselves with oars and sail , taking advantage of the shelter offered by the headland to protect them from the worst of the storms that annually assailed the vast bay to the north . Though adventure raced the blood when it lay in the future , it becameall too real and immediate when a landman was forced to step into a seagoing vessel for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . More than one brawny warrior kept a tight grip on his sword while hoarding , though none repeated Ir 's now-legendary attack on the waves.  |p290Scotta  presented herself for instruction on the same day as Eber Finn . She strode onto the beach dressed in plain tunic and leggings like a man and headed boldly for the nearest hide boat . Eber had been hiding a certain hesitancy himself , but when Scotta waded into the surf to help launch the boat he could hardly hang back . When the boat met the sea it leaped onto the outgoing tide like a living creature . At Sakkar 's signal , the neophyte crew clambered over the sides gracelessly . Sakkar , who was obviously enjoying himself , got them seated on the cross bracing that served for benches and demonstrated the proper technique for rowing . Eber took a place just behind his mother . " Scotta , " he said in a low voice as he leaned forward , " are you certain you want to do this ? " " And why should n't I ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waves beneath the thin shell of the boat and was eager to match her oar strokes to them , to propel this intriguing new vehicleforward . " I drove a chariot in my youth , " she told her son over her shoulder . " I was very good at it long before I ever thought of you . Eber felt like a child again , sternly reproved . " There 's not much juice left in your paps , " he said with unaccustomed harshness to her , and this is going to be a long journey . I see no need for you to man an oar . " " There 's more juice in my paps right now than there will ever be in yours ! " Scotta snapped at him . " I carried you once and I can carry you again . Look out there , you 've already let your oar come out of the water . " Sakkar was delighted with the hide boats . Under oar or sail they rose with extraordinary liveliness to meet and surmount the waves . Suggestions made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design , and Sakkar was quick to recognize the ingenuity of the Celtic mind . He appreciated these improvements more as time passed . The boats surrendered with docility to strong wind or rough tide , allowing themselves to be carried like leaves on the water until the sea calmed and they could resume their desired course . They were light enough to be easily beached and dragged beyond the tide line so they required no moorings , making them much easier to handle than the cumbersome galleys . They were , in short , a shipwright 's triumph . Sakkar was a happy man . For the first time in his life he gloried in freedom and was exalted by a sense of his own worth . The craftsman was honored among these people , his skills considered a talent likep291those of a bard or a healer , perhaps not so mysterious but equally necessary to the welfare of the tribe . And Sakkar was often greeted with , " Ai , craftsman ! " He began to feel very Gaelician . Ferdinon was impressed by Scotta 's display in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mil 's treasures , the bronze bench and the clanholding now shared by his sons  --  but most of all , Ferdinon had envied Milesios his wife . His widow , who was surely too vital to remain long without a man . She not only had the vigor of a much younger person , but in moments of uncertainty the new chief of the tribe found himself relying on her more and more . Perhaps it would be a bad idea to allow the Milesians to go to Ierne , even though their departure would mean he could take over their clanholdings and add them to his own  --  if he stayed . And he had secretly already determined to stay . Ferdinon had hungered too long for the bronze bench and the granite Heroes ' Hall of Milesios ever to want to leave them . He spoke to his other wives about adding to their number . " What makes you think Scotta would be willing to be the newest wife , bound by custom to the hardest work ? " they asked him . " The loss in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would shame a chieftain 's widow , Ferdinon . " He knew they were right . Still , whenever Ferdinon sat on his bench in the Heroes ' Hall , he found himself looking for Scotta 's bold face and dauntless eyes . The winter deepened and the wind moaned . Boatbuilding dragged to a halt . Erembn stood in the doorway of his house , gazing out at the cruel face of the Mother as she imprisoned him beneath his roof . Punishing him for all those cattle . Frustration burned in him like the burning tumors the samodhii shrank with a decoction of mistletoe . But that healing potion worked on the flesh only ; it could not cure an ailment of the spirit . Ierne had come to represent everything he wanted and was being denied . At first he had expected the boats would be quickly built and they would all he there by now , he and Taya together at last . But a pattern of delay had begun and then expanded itself with willful maliciousness . Now this long winter without progress must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her latest obsession and renewed her threats to go to the hrehons if she did not conceive . In desperation lie bedded her repeatedly , until the act took on ap292juiceless joylessness and he feared she would rob him of his very manhood . But she must be placated to avoid having her bring charges against Taya ; everything must be held together somehow , until the boats were ready . In the Heroes ' Hall , Amergin sympathized with him . " There are times I wish I could dive into the sea and swim to Ierne , " the bard said with a laugh . " If I were a little more like Ir I might try it . " " There are times I want to throttle my wife and send her back to her father on a litter , with her scrawny sheep trailing after her corpse , " Eremon responded , not laughing . " Then we would have a war we can ill afford right now when we need all our strength to get ready for the voyage , " Donn commented , stepping into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " There 's no satisfaction in being sensible , " Eremon complained . He doubled his fist and pounded the wall , skinning knuckles already permanently disfigured from similar assaults on unyielding surfaces . " I want to do something . " When he awoke the following morning Eremon discovered a rash on his hands and the thong broke as he tried to lace up his warm leggingsand there was mold in the bread and his head was stopped up and his accumulating anger made him so careless he cut himself on the jaw with his obsidian razor and for a blinding moment he hoped he would just bleed to death and be done with it . But the spirits would not countenance it . No . That was not the heroes ' way . After transition he would look back and hate himself for being so weak , seeking such a petty escape . He stood in the doorway and bleakly stared at the equally bleak land , trying to wait in stillness in the private recesses of his being , riding above the inactivity and frustration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that poetic history of his to keep him busy . Though Eremon did not understand busy-ness confined to the inside of one 's own head , at least he could see it did not depend on the weather . He must hold himself together , not letting anything destroy his strength of purpose . He must continue to be a caring friend and resoluteleader , building up his support against the time when they sailed for lerne . He would endure , holding it all within and losing nothing , not one precious drop of his fine fire and fury , until leaf-spring . A chariot just leaving the stronghold caught his attention . " Colptha again , " he said aloud to no one because he was hungry forp293the sound of a voice that was not Odba 's . " Almost every day now the sacrificer drives off in the direction of the chief druid 's clanhold . What 's he doing with 011ach ? " Amergin was wondering the same thing . One chill morning shortly after Imbolc he returned from a professional visit to the clan of Caicher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that led only to the chief druid 's small dwelling . It could hardly be called a house . Upon being named head of the order 011ach had moved into a tiny hut no bigger than a bedbox . To balance the opulenceof a tribal chieftain , chief druids traditionally practiced a severeausterity. 011ach had given away his jewelry and his household goods on the day of his inauguration , keeping only one iron cooking pot and a beechwood walking stick generations old . The simplicity of these possessions shouted of the wealth and prestige 011ach now commanded in the invisible world . Amergin noticed that Colptha had removed all ornamentation from his chariot and harness and was wearing a very plain cloak himself . And looking very pleased . " Your shadow continually darkens 011ach 's doorway , " the bard said , not bothering with a greeting . " Why ? " Colptha glanced enviously over his shoulder toward 011ach 's mean little , magnificent little hut . " 011ach has learned to value my opinionsand I have found him ... a receptive audience , " he replied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What are you up to now ? " " Working for the good of the tribe , of course . Assuring that they have the best leadership from the invisible world  --  once we get to Ierne . I have spent considerable time with 011ach lately , demonstrating ... my gifts . He was a little uncertain , a little humbled by the honor that had befallen him . He did not ... resist my support . " Colptha 's thin lips curved into something that would have been a smile on a different man . " 011ach agrees that I am the logical choice for chief druid on Ierne if my clan goes there and his does not . " Colptha was amused by Amergin 's appalled expression . " The honors I have always deserved will come to me at last , " he said complacently . " To replace what I lost . . . in Conmael . Warmth . Life . Do n't you understand , bard ? We made a grave mistake in neglecting our responsibilities to the Mother here , but when I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not repeated . We will win the Mother 's favor with constant sacrifices . Warm and living . " His voicep294sank to a lascivious purr . " The altars will run red on Ierne , " the sacrificer crooned . Shock held Amergin rooted to his chariot . Colptha 's face , transfiguredby naked lust , no longer seemed human to him , but the face of some implacable enemy against which he must struggle to the death ... or surrender Ierne to Colptha 's bloody vision . But what weapons could he fight with ? How could one druid attack another ? While he struggled for answers , Colptha looked beyond him and bared his teeth in a feral grin . " The spirits send an omen to show me they approve , " he said with overweening confidence . " Look over your shoulder , bard , at that orange light in the sky . It is a signal fire on the headland . The ships must be almost ready , for Ferdinon is summoning the clans to draw lots ! "  |p295ER  DIN() N WAITEI through one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to give clan-chiefs from the farthestreaches of Gaelician territory time to reach his stronghold . The druid measurers had reported the entire tribe to contain more than forty hundreds , the clans ranging in size from a handful of people huddled in a remote valley to sprawling communities like that of the Milesians . Such a clan might contain tens of tens itself , and as Milesioshad said , the tribe was growing . Their territory was not . People began arriving . Clan-chiefs in their chariots , bronze bedeckedand haughty , accompanied by warriors on horseback carryingtrophies from battles long since won but never forgotten . Even women in ox-drawn carts , children in their arms , eager to see their future decided . The guest house was filled to overflowing and the Gaelicians camped in the lee of the walls and under wagons , too heated with excitement to feel the lingering chill of the departing winter . A huge copper bowl was set up in front of the Heroes ' Hall . Ferdinon'scraftsmen had spent days painting an assortment of searoundedstones , some in brilliant but solid colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was understood by the painters , and they took great care to give the stones the beauty their importance demanded . The copper bowl , gleaming from an energetic sandscrubbing , stood on a carved wooden platform , and after 011ach delivered the sunrise invocation the clan-chiefs lined up before it . Ferdinon had spread his seven-colored cloak over the bowl with only one edge turned hack so a person might reach beneath it into darkness . Mindfulof the forms of hospitality , Ferdinon invited the clans who had come the longest distance to draw first  --  a ploy that left the final stones for his own family , itos , and the Milesians.  |p296The  first stone drawn from the bowl was dark red with a bright blue interlace painted around its circumference . A cheer went up . The happy clan-chief held his trophy aloft and his wives came running to him , elbowing through the crowd with a parade of children in their wake . They had raised many sons and daughters for this man and every one wanted to congratulate him . They joined in an impromptu dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those still waiting their turn . The sun moved in the sky and the line moved forward . Scotta would draw for her clan , so she was in no hurry to wait in a line ; she preferred to stand to one side , watching the people . Wondering if the Mil , wherever he was , was watching too . " Do you hope to go , or hope to stay ? " a lisping voice inquired behind her . She turned to face Ferdinon . " My sons are eager for Ierne , and my place is with my clan . " The chieftain gave her a searching look . " Suppose I told you I want you to stay here ? As my wife , and more importantly , as my advisor . Yott were invaluable to Milesios , everyone knew that , and you would be invaluable to me ; I would even buy a slave from the Hellenesto do the chores that would otherwise be assigned to you as newest wife in my house . I want you with me , Scotta . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? " " I do . " " And if I say no to your offer ? You are a shrewd man , Ferdinon ; I often said so to my husband . Am I correct in assuming you know what stones lie in the very bottom of the bowl , and you could manipulatethem to keep my whole clan here with you ? Obviously you know how to get a blank one for yourself . " He did not answer her , but his eyes sparkled with delight at her cleverness . The drawing went on . When the head of 011ach 's clan stepped forward , Colptha watched as tensely as the chief druid himself . The man reached into the bowl , winked over his shoulder at his followers , wiggled his fingers among the stones to add to the suspense , and at last drew out a plain blue pebble . He turned it over and over , seeking ornamentation , but there was none . He shuffled away from the bowl and his women wailed in disappointment . When 011ach stepped forward to comfort his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of triumph in his eyes.  |p297Clan  by clan the decision was made . These to the boats , those to stay behind and reclaim the pastures , tend the remaining herds . Those who stayed would be assured of sustenance , if not the level of luxury they had enjoyed in the old days of trade with the Sea People . Those who went could be certain of nothing but adventure and a dream besung by the bard . They were Celts , and that was enough . When only three clans remained , old Itos slid his skinny arm into the bowl . Veins bulged in his forehead . He licked his lips and hesitated , caught between two worlds . Then he gulped and picked out a stone . A stone the color of wild mustard , with an ocher serpentine balancedbetween its two halves . Lugaid and his clansmen shouted for joy . Itos just stood holding the large pebble while a light dawned on his face to rival the sun . He turned his head slowly , looking not for his own sons and grandsons but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lifted the stone above his head and cried , " Ierne ! " Then he crumpled and fell as if a spear had gone through his heart . He was dead by the time anyone could reach him . The Gaelicians gasped . " Ierne killed him , " someone said in a shocked voice . Instinctively the people drew back , unwilling to be too close to the dead man until some druid interpreted this startling omen . Ollach hurried forward and bent over Itos . Looking into the old man 's faded blue eyes , the samodhi watched life recede down a spiralingtunnel . The Gaelicians huddled together in silence , allowing the departing spirit room , and waited . Ollach stood up and faced them . " With his last breath Itos directed us to lerne , " the chief druid said . " This is a most potent sign , for the spirit of a strong man precedes us , easing our way . " He turned toward Ferdinon . " Have them finish the drawing . " " But what of Itos ? " Lugaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Itos is no longer here . Let his spirit 's empty house lie where he left it until the more important task is completed . " They recognized the druid wisdom in his voice , that certainknowledge which comes only from the invisible world ; the awareness of and adherence to a pattern larger than the life of ears and eyes. l'erciincin and Scotia came forward to draw for the last remainingp298clans . Itos lay directly in their path . Scotta crouched down beside him and pressed the back of her hand gently against his withered cheek in a final salute . Then she rose and with straight back and high head she stepped over the body and marched to the bowl . Her hair had turned iron gray since the Mil 's death and she had taken to wearing the short tunic of a warrior all the time , claiming it was less hampering than a long skirt . Her calf muscles flexed as she walked away from Ferdinon . Mother of warriors , he thought . Can I afford to let such a lioness leave me ? Only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which ones . Knew them by their feel , had held and studied them and turned them over and over in his hands , memorizing them . He joined Scotta beside the bowl and turned to face the assembled crowd . " As chief of the tribe , I have chosen for myself and my clan to stay here , " he said . " I will therefore forfeit my turn at the bowl and Scotta , daughter of Faronn , will draw for the Milesian clan . " Leave it to the spirits to decide , he thought . If I am meant to have her , they will see to it ; they have already given me the bronze bench . " No , Ferdinon , " Scotta said . " You draw for me . " They stared at each other . " It is your right , " he insisted , but she shook her head . " You are chief of the tribe now , Ferdinon , which means the responsibility for all of us is yours , " Scotta reminded him . " Draw for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will trust you . " The full weight of chiefdom descended on Ferdinon 's broad shouldersthen , as Scotta knew it would . At the Mil 's side she had learned many lessons , and this was one she must pass on to his successor . Ferdinon looked at her for a long , unblinking time , examining every strong plane of her face and trying to see her spirit . But she let him see only his own obligation , burdening him with her trust . If he failed , he would not be fit to lead the Gaelicians . Ferdinon reached into the bowl and lifted out the first stone his fingers touched without making any effort to feel it surreptitiously . He held up a round green stone with a spiral design covering most of its surface , then gravely extended it to Scotta . There was a flicker of genuine regret on her face as she took it . " You are a man , Ferdinon , " she told him . Erernon and Eher Finn crowded forward , jostling each other . Irp299was close behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward , tense in spite of himself . Colptha licked his thin lips and his hands curved into predatory claws , waiting . And on the edge of the crowd Amergin the bard stood tall and silent , with Clarsah on his shoulder . Scena rose on tiptoe , seeking his eyes . The two of them gazed  --  and it was a yearning gaze , neither could deny it  --  at each other across the heaving sea of excited people . Her people ... his people ... her pattern . . . his pattern .. . Once again , and for the last time , they moved in unison . Simultaneously , Scena Dullsaine and Amergin the bard looked away from each other , toward their different futures . Scotta raised her arm high above her head . " The clan of Milesios goes to Ierne ! " she cried . She glanced once at Ferdinon , letting her eyes run approvingly down his body to pay him a final compliment . " And I go with them , " she added . " What sons have ever outgrown their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the edge of the crowd . " Sing to us of Ierne , Amergin ! " she called . And the bard lifted the harp. o+Eriu of the Tuatha De Danann walked through her kingdom . In her heart the hawthorn was already blooming ; in her heart the newly hatched cygnets already nestled beneath the swan , peeping with bright eyes through her breast feathers . Winter  --  an easy winter this year , wet but gentled by the warm green river that flows through the ocean  --  was fading before the strengthening sun . The season of birth was approaching . And the season of anxiety . " The Fir Bolg are growing older , " Cet had reported just the day before , dividing his worries by sharing them with Greine and Cuill and their queens . " One of the women saw a band of warriors beyond the hazel grove . " " Not my hazel grove ! " Cuill protested , angered at an invasion of his favorite place . " Perhaps they were only following a stag , " Greine suggested . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They were deliberately corning as close as they dared to jab at us and see if we would hit back . They dare the Sword of I , ight. " p 300 " Fighting , quarreling , threatening the land , " sighed Eriu , shaking her head at them . " Perhaps the time has come to consider Unbodyingand put ourselves forever beyond war . Where else do our studies lead us ? " " We are not ready ! " shouted several voices at once , alarmed by her words . Eriu the ardent walked barefoot through the fields of Ierne . Under the high arch of her foot she felt the living land . Living . Great sentientgoddess , capable of adapting the conditions of existence for her many life forms . Goddess with her vital organs at the core , her renewableparts on the surface in a constant state of change , of birth and death and evolution . Sometimes of change forced against the will of one part , for the good of the whole . Eriu came to a pond lying in the lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The surface of the pond was as smooth as a sheet of polished metal . No leaf floated on the motionless water , no insect skimmed over it . The fish that lurked on the bottom lay unmoving in their green gloom so that no ripple betrayed their presence . She knew they were there by feel only , the small vital energy of their minds touching hers with delicate nibbles . Shinann would have felt them more keenly . Eriu sat on the bank , wrapping her arms around her knees like a young girl , and experienced the land . The pond was fringed with willows giving way on the east to a stand of sapling birch trees . A breeze moved across the hills , but the growth sheltering the pool kept its surface undisturbed . Perhaps nothing could disturb it ; perhaps it was frozen forever , the door to the past barred , the window to the future sealed , sky and clouds trapped in their own reflections for all the eons . On Ierne , perhaps nothing changed . Beauty was held captive by serenity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so slow it might not have been movement at all Eriu tipped her head back and looked up at the sky . Clouds sailed there like huge white galleys under invisible power . She watched them until her eyes burned , then she looked down at the water and saw the sky reflected there , the clouds less white , more menacingly piled atop one another . Clouds before a storm . Something moved in , or over , the pond . Some small thing  --  a first raindrop , a windblown seed  --  broke the unbearable tension of the surface and the ripples spread out in concentric circles , shatteringp301the polished image until nothing could be seen but motion and change . Eriu bowed her head on her knees . Time , the druids taught , was as amorphous as fog . Now it shrank overnight from an endless wasteland to become a rapidly closing door . The Gaelicians must scurry through quickly , gathering up their possessions in a desperate rush . Sakkar was adamant about an early departure ; something about storms on northern waters later in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lightest animals selected for the voyage , which meant not only searching the livestock pens in the clanholds but driving in the stock allowed to run wild in the hills and valleys . The similar selection or rejection of property  --  what to take and what to leave behind , and with whom  --  was a worry that consumed the women , making them as tired and irritable as their men . A number of fights were waged for reasons other than the pure joy of combat . Clans disappointed in the outcome of the drawing tried to prove their nobility by being excessively magnanimous , overburdening the colonists with more than they could ever carry . Findmall , son of Ferdinon , insisted on giving Soorgeh his best chariot , enough salted meat for three winters , and ten splendidly carved ox yokes . " We 're only taking calves , " Soorgeh protested . " They wo n't wear heavy yokes for several seasons after we reach Ierne , and those things will take up unnecessary room in the boat . " " They are a gift to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protested , aggrieved . " I will never see you again ; would you reject this last small gesture ? Your wives can sit on the yokes , it is n't much to ask . Or do you already scorn the craftsmanship of your native land ? " " I 'll take them , " Soorgeh said with a sigh . Ten ox yokes in his boat would mean the women would have to leave some of their own boxes and chests behind , and there would surely be trouble over that . While Sakkar was overseeing the last details at the harbor , Amergintook time to say good-bye to his house . A few nights remained before the actual departure , but Amergin thought it best to have his farewells behind him by ' then so he could concentrate on seeing and rentembering every aspect of the adventure.  |p302There  was the climax of his epic , he thought ; the story he could not tell because it had not yet happened . He sat alone beneath his roof and looked at the familiar smoked walls . The birds in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in iron . His bedbox piled with soft calfskins , and the platform of honor beside it for Clarsah . Benches worn to the shape of his buttocks . Why , the bard asked himself in the silence , did I never really appreciatehow beautiful and comfortable this house is until now ? Will I be able to build another as good on Ierne ? Are we making a mistake ? He said it again , aloud , but Clarsah did not answer him . " Some things are hard to know , even for a druid . My instincts were right about Colptha , but when I try to look ahead to the voyage and Ierne they become entangled in seawind and daydreams and I can not be certain . . . Never mind the signs and portents . If we wanted to stay here I suspect we could find plenty of omens telling us we should remainwhere we are . " He cradled the harp in his arms . What would so many days on the open sea do to a fragile being of wood and wire ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her onto the ocean , perhapsdrown her in it with himself , swallowed by dark waves . Singing songs for whatever lives at the bottom of the sea . But he would take her , no matter what lay in store . As Colptha had so rightly pointed out , Arnergin carried no weapon save for the harp . The gift of poetry , pitted against Colptha 's rampant hatred in a green land none of them had yet seen , except in their secret dreams . Amergin held Clarsah against himself and rested his cheek on her wooden frame . Cold , hard , lifeless wood . If Eremon were out of the way , Colptha had said .. . " No ! " the bard cried aloud . " No , sacrificer ! I will fight you with all the strength I have ! " The bard 's voice echoed hollowly in the silence of his house . The birds in their boxes , disturbed , admonished him with clucking reproof . And then , when everyone agreed that no one was ready , the season of departure arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colptha examinedthe entrails of sacrifice , the samodhii consulted the patterns of the stars . Ferdinon and N:renic n consulted with Sakkar about boatsp303and tides and currents , Eber Finn and the herders consulted with their livestock . And 011ach appointed Colptha the sacrificer to be chief druid when the colonists reached Ierne . Amergin stood in rigid silence in the nemeton as Colptha 's name was chanted to the trees and the watching spirits . The bard saw fire leap in the sacrificer 's eyes . There seemed to be a smell of blood on the wind . Four nights later the Moon Sister would show her full face to the Earth Mother and they would lock invisible hands across emptiness , tugging at each other . At this most auspicious time for journeying , the fleet of colonization would set sail . With departure set for the next day , Eremon chose full-moon night for an act of courage even the bravest man might postpone as long as he could . Odba was packing cheese and dried fruit for their journey , and he stood behind her stooped back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Taya , daughter of Lugaid , will sail with us in my ship and she will live in my house when we get to Ierne . " Odba did not move . She did not even straighten up and whirl around to yell at him . The posture of her bent back was eloquent enough . " I am your wife , " she said in a muffled voice . " Your only wife ; the only woman entitled to live in your house . " " You will still be my wife on Ierne . My senior wife . " " Why did n't you tell me about this sooner ? " she asked , straighteningvery slowly , still not turning to face him . " I thought it better to wait for the right time . " " And the last moment is the right time ? When there is no opportunityleft for me to do anything about it ? " Answering questions was a defensive position , and Eremon scorned being on the defensive . " Are you threatening to refuse to come with me if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can hardly petition the brehons now , they will not convene again for . . . but yes . Yes ! I can refuse to go . " In her anger she had swallowed his suggestion . Eremon appeared to consider this for the first time . " I suppose you could . I 'll be leaving a lot of property behind me , of course , everythingthat wo n't fit in the ship . Sheep , cattle , household goods , tools , even some jewelry , I think . And you would have my share of the clanhold land , of course . As long as you occupy it Ferdinon can not claim that parcel . You would be a wealthy woman , ( ) dba. "  | " You mean you would leave your sons wealthy , " she said bitterly , refusing to allow him the smallest credit for generosity . This was the worst moment for Eremon . " I do not leave my sons at all , " he told her . " They 're going on the ship with me . Scotta has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weapon and must be considered a man , independent of his mother . " In the silence he could hear insects move through the thatch of his roof . Odba 's face had convulsed with so many emotions during the seasonsof their marriage he thought he knew them all , but the one she wore now as she slowly looked toward him was unique . She looked dead . " Did you hear me , Odba ? " She nodded , but made no sound . She forced him to fill the silence by defending his position after all , and he resented it . He should have expected a woman like Odba to fight unfairly . " My sons will be needed on Ierne , the place has some natives and we expect to fight for the island . My sons belong with their clan , not left behind and cut off from their chance for glory . " " Glory , " Odba said with a sniff . " What is glory to me ? I never sought it , I only wanted to be your wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I with them , wherever they go . After all , your mother goes with you . " " Scotta understands the need for glory , " Eremon said . " Besides , who could stop her ? " Then he realized he must strike now and decisively , before Odba 's mind was made up ; he must use his knowledge of the woman against her if he was to win . He reminded himself that she had already fought unfairly  --  this was her fault , she forced him to it . He grabbed her more roughly than a man should ever grab a chieftain 's daughter and shook her as he had wanted to shake her so many times before . " If you want to be with my sons you shall , " he told her . " You will come with us and live in my house with Taya and me , and even if you are barren you can help her when her babies start to come . You can guide them into this life , you can ... " " How dare you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You expect me to be a midwife to that . . . to that . . . she 's put a curse on you all right , and on me as well ! I would rather go to my tomb this very night than ever have to see her again , or have to watch my sons share their inheritance with hers ! Go to ( erne. ' fake my children andp305turn them into replicas of yourself . But do n't expect me to submit to any further humiliation at the hands of Lugaid 's daughter . You can both sink to the bottom of the sea while I stay here wealthy and happilyfree of both of you ! " She abandoned her chores from that moment and lay down on the bed , pulling a calfskin robe over her head . The three boys , confused and upset by this particular quarrel , clustered around Eremon demandingan explanation . " Your mother has decided not to undertake the voyage to Ierne , " he told them . " Many women are reluctant , as you know . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you boar hunting when we get there ... and let you drive my chariot . " The boys looked uncertainly toward their mother , but the silent mound beneath the calfskin had withdrawn from all of them . Dawn . A cool , clear dawn , with strands of coral cloud parting like old wool to allow the sun to rise through them . The livestock were penned and hobbled , parcels and chests and sacks were piled on the beaches , long and emotional good-byes had been said and must not be endured a second time . The Gaels were leaving Iberia . With prodigious effort , they had built and readied a fleet for the migration . Four tens of hide boats , holding a maximum of ten oarsmento a side , would carry not only their crewmen but wives and children and penned young animals . The four wooden galleys were reserved for the largest clans , and of these , the Milesians occupied two . The children of the Mil as well as the occupants of his clanhold , nobles and freemen alike , had loaded their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big ships were crammed from how to stern . Eremon , who had campaigned hard to assert his right to be leader of the expedition , had examined the timber vessels beforehand and claimed the choicest for himself . He had chafed at Sakkar 's prohibitionagainst bringing more than one team of grown horses per chariot , and the limitation of only one chariot to a warrior  --  but Eber Finn , who had many fine horses , complained more . Sakkar was amused that they had no concept of a flagship , but hung their shields along the bows and thought that adequate identification . When Donn had been assigned the second galley , Colptha hadp306muttered to Eber Finn , " Eremon and Donn between them will squeeze you out if you let them . " " Scotta is clan-chief ; she made the decision . " " You see ? Already they are trying to separate you from her , now that she has the Mil 's authority . They are jealous of you because you have the closest bond with Scotta , Eber . Watch them , watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began watching his brothers . As luggage piled up along the beach , Dil grew concerned . " Can we get everything in that ship ? " she asked Donn . " I 'm afraid I will be so squeezed I can not breathe . " Donn smiled and patted her arm . " Breathe when we get to Ierne , " he told her . Scotta , clan-chief of the Milesians , had intended to sail in Eremon 's galley , but Eber came to her at the last moment and made such a fuss about having her in Donn 's galley that she relented . " I go with Donn and I want you with us , where we can take care of you , " Eber said urgently . Scotta accepted , but in her head she changed the order of his words around to better define the situation as she saw it . Ir and Amergin would make the journey in Eremon 's ship , and Sakkar as well , with the priceless sea charts . Two tiers of oarsmen were required for each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places as crew . Only the druids were exempt from labor . Amergin was relieved when Scotta told Colptha he must go in Donn 's ship . " Though I would prefer she told him he could not go at all , " the bard whispered to Clarsah. 011ach delivered the sunrise invocation on the morning of departure , though for once even the chief druid had difficulty quieting the huge crowd . Then , as the baggage and livestock were taken aboard , Findbar the brehon began reciting the rights and entitlements of the various classes of the tribe , so that they would remember the Law in their new land and not let it be pulled out of shape . Even the wind hushed to listen as Findbar recited , from perfect memory , the prerequisites for being a cattle lord . " Each of you who sets foot on the new land is to claim land for himself and his livestock in the amount of at least twenty-seven cumals . Build the best house you can , for a man 's dwelling is the exterior skin he fashions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your building ma/terials for strength and beauty , and use only the most skilled craftsmen , rewarding them generously according to their ability . " Each noble must equip his dwelling with one bronze ceremonial cauldron with a spit and handles , a vat in which a measure of grain liquor can be brewed , an iron cauldron for common use , enough iron cups and mugs and kneading troughs that you will never have to borrow , a washing trough and washing ewer , rush-cutting knives , ropes , an adze , an auger , a saw , shears , an axe , a whetstone , and a bill-hook of the best quality , all wrapped in oiled hides , a spear for butchering cattle , three lamps for every circle , a plow for the earth , a bucket for milk and a bucket for grain liquor , three leather sacks for grain , salt , and charcoal , a cloak chest for every member of your household , a washing kettle for guests . " Changing his voice one tone to indicate a change in rank , Findbar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status than cattle lords . " You may own a barn , a shed , a kiln , one share of a mill , a pigsty , a calf-fold , a sheep-fold , twenty cows , six oxen , twenty sheep , two brood sows , one horse with an enameled bridle , four changes of clothes for each member of your household ... " His voice went on and on , specifying property , until even Eremon 's voice was not so hoarse . Meanwhile , other brehons recited the Law as it applied to beekeeping , to fabric dyeing , to every aspect of Celtic life , demanding that the people remember and continue to be guided by the ancient wisdoms . Sakkar observed this seemingly endless recital with amazement . Whatever he had once thought these people were , it was obvious they were something else . Something ancient and complex and irresistiblybeautiful to him , a way of life in which both individuality and responsibility for each other were simultaneously emphasized , and a person 's freedom and dignity considered the natural birthright of men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Celtic tribes was already too far in the past for the average Phoenician mind to grasp . Sakkar was intelligent enough to realize that his own culture was a chasm , separating him from these people and their Law  --  their Law that held them balanced between savage flesh and soaring spirit , at one with themselves and their environment , controlled by the demands of honor and prestige and freed by their awareness of their own immortality . Cities , and ships , and the calculated cruelties the Ilellenes calledp308civilization had , Sakkar thought , deformed man more than a broken shoulder ever could . Perhaps he would never truly be one of them , but Sakkar would go wherever these people led , go by choice and with love , for whatever they were was the kernel of his own small personal dream . And if the Lady of the Sea swallowed them all , at least he would die in good and chosen company . Having lost the services of a wife , Eremon was forced to complete his personal preparations for departure by himself . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons were on the beach long before sunrise on departure day , shivering with anticipation rather than cold . The wind off the sea sang a song of passage . Loading the boats was a tedious process . Eremon led his best team of chariot horses aboard with cloths tied over their eyes to keep them docile . Eber Finn made a big display of loading his team without blindfolds . " My animals are too well trained to think of disobeying , " he yelled across the water so Eremon could hear him . Ir could hardly be lured on board . He splashed wildly in the surf , to his watching wife 's despair , and after he got on he got off again a dozen times , running onto the beach to say farewell to someone or just to admire the spectacle from some new vantage point . No one could manage him until Amergin boarded with Clarsah , but when the bard began to sing Ir settled himself to listen and did not leave the ship again . Some of the others , even stalwart Brego and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of expression usually seen only on the evening before battle , when a man must seek in strange places to find his courage . Once they were on their own vessels they watched the shore , or the horizon  --  anything but the sea . At Eremon 's direction , the clans had been divided among the boats so that even if some were lost , other members of that family might survive . This had been Scotta 's idea , one she suggested to Eremon to enhance his own reputation for wise leadership . But Eremon did not like to think ideas could come from women , even warrior women , so Scotta mentioned it casually as something Milesioshad once suggested , then dropped the subject . When Eremon announced the plan everyone applauded its cleverness . " Children , " Scotta snorted to Dil as they made themselves comfortableon Donn 's ship . " You might tell them six times how to do ap309thing , step by step , expecting the clear reasonableness of it to be sufficientinducement . But one 's children never understand . They never simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and think of something else when a parent speaks , and then , when an idea finallybreaks through the resistant murk of their minds they believe it to be their own discovery and are mightily pleased with themselves for having had a new thought . " Scotta knew how to handle her children . The vessels were loaded ; the captains went ashore one last time to make certain nothing was being left behind . Now Eremon brought his sons to the water 's edge , following him in an obedient row like golden-crested ducklings . Moomneh had grown tall for his age , with a line of masculine jaw jutting through the boyish roundness of his face . Legneh was stocky and deep-chested , possessed of a strength he had not yet fully realized . And bringing up the rear was young Lagneh , the only one who looked back over his shoulder to catch a glimpse of his mother . Lagneh of the chubby cheeks and irrepressibly curly hair ; Lagneh , with his toes turned in . " Come ahead , men ! " Eremon yelled hoarsely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in the ship ! " Odba could not bear to stand with the other spectators . She edged away from the crowd and waited alone , dressed in a new gown and all the jewelry Eremon had left beind . It weighed her down , embracingher flesh with cold metal . She saw Lagneh look back , searching for her face , excitement and apprehension warring in his blue eyes . Eremon 's blue eyes . Eremon striding forward eagerly , fearless and magnificent , lost to her because of her own unbending pride . There was still time . If she called his name , if she ran . . A female figure detached itself from the throng saying farewell to the clan of Itos and hurried toward Eremon . Lugaid yelled in sudden anger but the woman did not turn around and go back to him . She continued forward , struggling under the weight of her belongings . As she neared the timber galleys she called Eremon 's name and he stopped for her , ran to her , helped her collect the things she had dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ship with him , his sons looking at her with surprise and a degree of hostility . In deaf and dumb isolation , Odba watched the fleet set sail withouther.  |p310THERE  MUST BE no hesitation now . Summoning all the courage of their ancestors , the Gaels turned their faces toward Ierne and stepped off the edge of their world . Floating on faith , driven by dreams , the fleet went out with the tide . The sea heaved and swelled and carried them , and the coastline of their birthland shrank and disappeared . The sons of the Mil led the way , riding triumphantly in the big wooden galleys and keeping their eyes fixed on the far horizon . Held in the Celtic thrall of excessive emotion , they laughed and shouted and wept by turns , freely . It was not long , of course , before some of the Gaels turned green and developed a passionate interest in leaning over the side . Even the children were not immune to surging stomachs , but they soon made a contest of their ailment , seeing who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself amidships , where Clarsah was relatively safe from seaspray thanks to a screen of leather erected to shield perishable goods . Amergin was not allowed to man the oars . His contribution was of the mind and spirit and must be kept separate , but he saw how gladly the warriors applied themselves to the new challenge . They urged one another on and laughed as blisters arose on their hands , and in a great rush of release they forgot the enmities that had strangely developed among them during the last few seasons . The great leather sails stood square and clean and the wind leaned into them , so the oarsmen could relax . " It will rarely be this easy , " Sakkar warned Eremon . " If the charts are right , most of the time we will have to forgo the sails and row against the current . The oars are our only true friends in these waters . " Oars might be more necessary , but Amergin preferred the beautyp311of the sails . Artisans had painted them with symbols of meaning for the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sword and , as an acknowledgment of Amergin 's role in the venture , a representation of a harp . At Eber Finn 's insistence Donn had had a stylized Celtic version of a Libyan lion painted on his sail , primarily because he could think of no showy symbol of his own . " I do n't care what design you put on the sail , " Colptha had said . " But paint the background red . The color of life . " Donn could not summon the will to resist , and thereafter those on his galley often found themselves bathed in a peculiar red glow when light was reflectedfrom the crimson sail . Amergin disliked looking across the water and seeing that bloody hue stain his brothers ' ship . Turning his back on it , he held up Clarsahto Eremon 's sail instead so she could hear the wind singing across its surface . That sound must be incorporated into his epic when the time came . The poem was coming to life in him again . It had lain quiescent in a fluid darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between distractions . Amergin had been constantly , painfully aware of it , and sometimes he had feared it would die for lack of nourishmentwhile he spent his energies fretting over Taya and Eremon , Conmael and Colptha .. . But on board ship the sharp wind sang into the sails and the poem began to grow again . Or perhaps ... it was not a poem . It was all of language shaped into a song , words sufficing for music . It was a brand-new thing that had never been before . Amergin had originally intended the history of his race to be contained in the traditional forms , constructed from symbol to symbol to a chanted accompaniment , as was the Celtic custom . But the epic growing within him was its own self , struggling to be free of narrow traditional boundaries . New forms were implicit in its existence ; new concepts for man and his relation to the world around him were constantlybeing suggested to Amergin by the very experience he was undergoing . Gaul and Iberia , ocean and Ierne , all were shaping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form them , shaped by the dreams that men create . The men that dreams ' create . He had not been able to tell the story of his race so long as it ex/isted only in the past , like bones in a tomb . The epic of the Celts must include the new land they were seeking and the new people they were becoming , led by the longing of a bard . A song of possibilities . Perhaps it came from his heart ; perhaps it came from his head . He felt it as a physical presence within his skull , squirming when he tried to get a grip on it and force it into shape . He clamped down with all his concentration , hammering and molding like a smith at his forge . The poem was a living thing and would not be forced . It shifted shape and he pursued it , oblivious to everything else . " I said , Sing us a song of Ierne ' " Eremon was shouting at him . " When you describe our destination the oarsmen seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wind and sang of Ierne as he dreamed her , sweet and fruitful and wise , separated from the struggle for existence and endless warfare of the known world by a band of broad sea . He sang of ruddy-cheeked Gaelic children who would be less obsessed by the sword than by the beauty with which Ierne showered them . He sang of bards and craftsmen and healers , fat golden cattle and thatched cottages and close-knit clans . Beneath the red sail of Donn 's galley Colptha stood listening , catching snatches of Amergin 's words across the water . " The bard is a fool , " he said contemptuously to Donn . " He dismisses the power of the blade because it does not interest him , but I tell you that life everywhere depends on the spilling of blood . Nothing else is as important . Our people suffered greatly because they put their trust in traders and did not placate the Earth Mother with sufficient sacri-fices . " " We observed the druid rituals , " Donn replied , insulted . " Sacrificeis only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Wrong ! Irial taught that , but he was wrong ! The tin failed and the floods came because we did not woo the Mother with enough blood . She is a savage goddess and I alone understand her . " Donn went to the first tier of oarsmen and commented to his brother , Eber , who was taking his turn at the oars , " Since Conmael died all Colptha seems to think about is blood sacrifice . It gives me the itch , listening to him . " " Maybe he 's right . All those years of trade rnade us fat and complacentand we did n't pay as much attention to the rituals as we once did . When we get to Ierne . I for one intend to have a big healthyp313herd , and if that means offering more sacrifices I 'll gladly send for Colptha . " Donn 's wiry eyebrows tangled into a frown . " Does Colptha ever stand behind you and just ... whisper ? In a strange way ? " Eber Finn thought for a moment . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a most insidious voice . He does n't seem to be saying anything much but I ca n't help listening . " " Maybe we should n't , " Donn said thoughtfully . " We should all think for ourselves . " Eber laughed , not unkindly . " If I thought as ponderously and slowly as you do I 'd be dead before I finished . " Donn chuckled with him , accustomed to the teasing of brothers . Loving brothers . The sea was kind , at first . Sometimes the vessels wallowed windless in long slow swells and the oarsmen sweated and grunted , but then a light breeze would spring up and give them a heartening push . And even when the prevailing wind was against them , which was much of the time , Sakkar 's ships and boats proved well-designed and managed to make steady progress . But the journey had begun with deceptiveease that Sakkar , after a lifetime at sea , heartily mistrusted . He said as much to Eremon , who was not interested in gloomy predictions . As they reached the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great gulf to the land of the Fir Morca , the first real trouble began . Eremon was standing in the prow of his ship , enjoying the sensation of being propelled over immeasurable watery distances . World , world , the world , he thought , gazing toward the far horizon . We used to speak of the world as if we knew what it was , yet we rarely went farther than ten nights from home . Out there lies the world , and this endless water is the roadway to it . I did not realize . On the sea we could go anywhere , take whatever we need .. . In the blinking of an eye the sky turned dark and the wind changed ; changed with a vengeance , hitting the boats broadside and pummeling them savagely . The water became as dark as the sky , and Eremon saw white crests curl across the choppy waves , whipped by the lash of the wind like the manes of white horses . Corisios ' voice echoed ' in his mind , magnified by memory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manes of the horses ... " Sakkar was yelling , trying to prepare the crew for the fast-ap/proaching squall and hoping the other captains would remember to watch and copy the tactics of the lead ship . Waves raked the hide boats , an occasional outsize rogue rising to reflect its green light on the pallid faces of the people within . Eremon 's galley rolled into a deep wave-trough and water poured over the side , drenching everything . The bard 's feet slipped out from under him and he fell across the harp . Clarsah cried out with discordantaffront . Amergin 's eyes and mouth filled with salt water as warm as blood , hissing with foam . " Head into the wind ! Head into the wind ! " Sakkar was screaming , but in the excitement he forgot his recent Celtic fluency and issued furious orders in Phoenician . His babble fell on uncomprehending ears . The timber galleys were having difficulties but the hide boats seemed to bob atop the water jauntily , driven before the wind but remaining afloat . Their crews gave up fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When they realized their galleys were floundering , the other captainslooked toward Eremon 's ship for guidance . They saw Sakkar waving his arms and heard him shouting , but though the wind carriedhis words toward them the words themselves were no more than gibberish . The Milesians , grim-faced , the powerful muscles of their shoulders and backs bulging with effort , were bent over their oars , committed to a losing battle . Donn 's galley rolled heavily to one side and one of Eber 's chariot horses , tethered amidships , broke loose and went scrambling and sliding across the deck , his hooves battering the planking . The ship heeled up again , higher than before , and it seemed half the sea came splashing over the side . When it went hissing back the panicked horse went with it . Eber Finn screamed like a man who has lost a leg in battle . Dil crouched in the stern , her youngest daughter clutched to her bosom . Eber 's wives were taking turns at the oars and his stronger sons were helping them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was certain that if she moved one step in any direction the whole ship would turn over . Donn , in spite of the desperation of the moment , looked for his wife and caught her eye . He looked as competent and solid as always , and Dil managed to force her icy lips to send him a brave littlep315smile . Somehow that made them both feel better . Maybe they would all survive this . Maybe . Amergin had gotten to his feet again and wedged Clarsah between two coils of rope , where she should be safe if not dry . He waded a deck awash with seawater to yell in Sakkar 's ear , " You 're giving orders in Phoenician ! No one can understand you ! " Sakkar looked stricken . " I should be sacrificed , " he said , rolling his eyes skyward . " We all will be if you do n't tell us what to do ! " In the Gaelician dialect now , and at the top of his lungs , Sakkar cried , " Into the wind , head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issuing more detailed instructions to the various crewmen . Slowly , Eremon 's ship came around . Donn observed the maneuver and gave his crew similar orders and the other galleys followed their example . By the time the squall began to subside , the ships were under control again . There was no heart for proceeding farther that day . They made for the nearest beach to wait until the hide boats could regain their course and catch up . Only then could casualties be determined . As they went ashore , a sense of jubilation seized the Gaels . They felt they had met the worst the sea had to offer and had survived it . Ir was running his hands through his drenched hair and laughing gleefully . Sakkar hated having to tell them this was just a squall ; the sea was capable of much more violent behavior . The druids counted the boats as they straggled in . It was well into the next morning before the last one appeared , having searched a long way up the coast while its anxious crew feared the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joyful cries upon finding their tribesmen rang back from the wooded shore . They were well into the territory of the Gauls now . Sakkar disliked spending time ashore . He was ever mindful of the storms sure to come later in the season . " If you think that was bad , " he told Eremon , " you should know it was nothing compared to what we will run into if we do n't reach Ierne by summer . " Ir laughed . " We 're not afraid . You build good boats , Phoenician ; they can ride out anything . " " No ship has ever been built that can ride out anything , " Sakkar tried to tell hinn , but Ir was in no mood to listen . Ile had never en/joyed himself so much and was already looking forward eagerly to the next storm . In spite of Sakkar 's urging , Eber argued that they spend a few nights ashore , trading with the Gauls for food and water and , he hoped , a replacement chariot horse . He was distraught over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now mine is ruined , " he complained to Scotta . " I will be ashamed before my brothers . " " Let him get another horse , " Scotta advised Eremon . " I can not listen to that all the way to Ierne . " A trading party made its way inland but soon returned empty handed . Eremon explained , " The Gauls are there , all right ; there 's a big tribe just beyond that forestland . But they were very suspicious of us . They 've seen too many Sea People in these waters , they do n't trust anyone in a ship anymore . " And they have no interest in trade these days . The whole tribe is singing the praises of a mighty chieftain named Brennus who has marched east with an army to attack the city of the Romans . They have taken warriors with them from all over the territory . " " Why are the Gauls attacking the Romans ? " Scotta wondered . " Who are the Romans ? " others asked . Sakkar , who knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to look nervously northward , toward the rising power of the Romans . " I learned very little about them , " Eremon replied . " They are an arrogant people who seem to have intruded themselves in some disputebetween the Etruscans and a Celtic tribe in that region , and they gravely insulted the Celts . Honor must be defended and our distant kinsmen marched to do so . Soon the Celtic tribes along the borders of the land these Romans claim found themselves at war with the Romans . The men of Rome seem to have a warped sense of justice , and even went so far as to insist that their concept of the Law superseded our own . " War has run through Gaulish territory like brushfire , for of course the chieftains could not allow such ideas voice in their own lands . Brennus has drawn enthusiastic followers from many tribes and seems to have attacked , or intends to attack , the city of the Romans itself . " It sounds like a lovely war , " he added wistfully . " We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p317Taya  put her hand on Eremon 's arm and tugged , and at last his thoughts came back to her . " Yes , " he said slowly . " Yes ! We go on to Ierne and the Gauls must settle their own quarrels . They should teach those Romans about brehons . " They put out to sea again , in search of their particular destiny . The encounter with the Gauls made Sakkar fearful of too much land involvement . When the last boat cleared the shore , he suggested to Eremon that the time had come to stop beaching the vessels each night . Too much daylight was being wasted in the maneuver , not to mention the danger of encountering even more hostile tribes along the shore . " There are numerous reasons for sleeping aboard ship , " Sakkar explained . " The timber galleys have anchors and the hide boats can be lashed to one another so they do not drift away . It will be much better ; we will reach Ierne sooner . We have enough supplies now , we really do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls that of the Fir Morca , just before we cross the open sea . " So they slept that night on the bosom of the waves . Amergin lay with his head on his folded cloak as the stars above him wheeled by in their silver chariots . The sea rocked him to her own rhythms . He held Clarsah and let his fingers stroke her as they pleased , his mind disengaged from the process , only peripherally wondering if he would be able to get brass wire for harpstrings on Ierne . The music floated out across the water . Taya , lying curled against Eremon with her head on his shoulder , felt the voice of the harp pluck at the fibers of her spirit . The pain of beauty was almost unbearable  --  the harp , the stars , the sea . " Listen , Eremon ! " she whispered . But the warrior was asleep . She had no one to talk to , and that was the worst of it . Odba woke up in the morning and looked at the carved chests  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cattle beyond the house  --  all hers . And none of it meant anything . Her sons ' belongings were not in those chests ; her husband did not use the bronze utensils . The sheep and cattle truly belonged to the herders who tended them and knew their spirits more intimately than snie ever would . All Odba had was the echoing silence . She could not keep her eyes from straying to Eremon 's leftbehinds , the small arrangenients with which he had once addedp318comfort to his life . A full wineskin suspended by a thong near his bed , because he often awakened at night with a dry throat . A three-legged stool he propped his foot on while massaging a battle-damaged knee . A little alabaster box , forgotten in the final confusion , containing Eremon 's favorite polishing compound . On rainy days he liked to sit by the hearth , burnishing his weapons and jewelry , while the boys clustered around him , begging to be allowed to polish the bronze bosses on his horse harness . Just a little thing , an imported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit here with my hands folded , Odba told herself . I am a daughter of the Artabri , I can go back to my tribe . I can accept another husband . But how would she explain to a new man the loss of her former one ? Who would want a woman another abandoned ? Who would believe she was simply too fearful to make the voyage ? Everyone who knew Odba knew she was not a timid woman . She must get outside , under the sky , and talk to someone other than herself . Anyplace was better than the house that was now hers . All hers . Hers alone . She almost bolted from the house , and the first person she met was Scena Dullsaine . Odba greeted Ferdin  --  n 's favorite daughter as a kindred spirit . Had not Amergin sailed off and left her behind ? But when she said somethingof the sort aloud , Scena rewarded her with an arrogant look and a patronizing voice . " No man leaves me , " she said coolly . " I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat , and drowning in cold water for the sake of a man who had begun to bore me anyway . It was my decision to stay here and live as I like , on familiar ground . " " I live as I like , also , " Odba 's pride forced her to reply . The whine had gone out of her voice when hope had gone . Complaint was a form of pressure , and now she had no one to pressure . Scena put her hands on her ample hips and faced Odba sternly , as she contradicted the woman . " You 're miserable and you know it . Look at you . Your eyes are as red as raw meat . I asssure you you wo n't feel any better until you admit you feel bad . " " What good would it do , Scena ? " Odba said . " What good does anything do ? I would have drunk the muddy water from Eremon 's footprints , yet I drove him away . I can see that now , but it makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Life makes no sense , but we enjoy it anyway , perhaps for that very reason . " " I have nothing left to enjoy . " Odba felt so beaten she could not even savor her misery . " Tell me , Scena , what hurts most  --  regret for something you 've done , or regret for something you did n't do ? " " Those are druid questions . I never think about such things . " " I think about a lot of things I never concerned myself with before . What else have I to do ? I have even wondered if I should have jumped into the water and tried to swim after them . . . perhaps Eremon would have taken pity on me and had me pulled into a boat . " " Why bother to swim at all ? " Scena asked idly . " If you want to be in a boat , take one of those we already have . " " What do you mean ? " " Ferdinon had Sakkar leave two hide boats behind to trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quite seaworthy , I should think . " Odba 's rounded shoulders straightened perceptibly . A light came into her eyes which Scena did not like . " Boats , " she murmured . " Do n't think mad thoughts ! " Scena warned her , too late . " Leave such glorious foolishness to the Milesians . " " Glory , " Odba said in the same faraway tone . " Eremon would be mightily impressed if I followed him all the way to Ierne . Even Scotta never earned such glory as I would have then . " " Even Scotta would never have done such a thing ! " Odba shook her head . " She might have , in her youth . You do n't know her as I do ; you have n't had her virtues and victories endlessly rammed down your throat . " " Such talk is idle chatter and you know it , Odba . You could n't sail to Ierne by yourself , and you have n't a crew . " Odba 's eyes narrowed to slits , seeing visions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves into a new and gallant set , shapechanging like a druid to take on needed qualities . " Many men were disappointed when their clans were n't able to go , " she said thoughtfully . " Surely I could find enough strong arms to man one boat for Ierne , if Ferdinon would give his permission . " Scena felt herself being drawn into the spirit of the adventure . " He just might , " she told the other woman . " I know he was upset when he found one part of the Milesian clanhold was still claimed by a clanrnemher. 1 lc night give you a boat and Wien gladly enough if youp320were willing to abandon your property to him . " Then caution overtookher . " But the dangers , Odba ! You could die out there and no one would know . The sea could swallow you and no one would mourn you . " Odba shrugged . " You threaten me with very small discomforts compared to the misery of sitting in an empty house watching an empty doorway . " The idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without hesitation , knowing she dare not pause to consider . She was a chieftain 's daughter , and as fearless as her husband . Her sons . Little Lagneh , who had looked back at her . " Will you go with me to talk to Ferdinon ? " she asked Scena . " I would n't miss it , " the other woman assured her . Odba felt as if she were walking into a shifting wind . Between one heartbeat and the next everything had changed for her , and no matterwhat happened in the future , she had taken charge of her life again ; she would not be moved about and discarded at the whim of others . When she told Ferdinon of her intention he proved more generous than she had hoped . He offered her all the men who were willing to go , until she had filled one boat , and all the supplies the party would need to take . Glowing with pleasure at his windfall of the last Milesianholdings , Ferdinon even promised , " In honor of you and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's watchtowerfrom which Itos first saw the vision of Ierne . That way we will never forget any of you , " he assured Odba , picturing Scotta in his mind . As they left the Heroes ' Hall , Odba turned almost shyly to Scena Dullsaine . " Will you go with me ? " she invited . " Amergin might be glad to see you . " Scena laughed . " Oh , no . I never chew my meat twice . But you can do something for me , if you will . Should you meet the bard again , will you tell him I had the chance to come and refused ? Tell him I could think of no sufficient inducement . Put it just that way , Odba  --  no sufficient inducement . " Scena 's laugh was deep and throaty , without malice , and she threw her head back to let it ring out merrily . Odba joined in , feeling she had just returned to life.  |p321As  Odba was making her hurried preparations , the fleet of the Gaels continued northward , following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was making them bolder . They sailed farther out from shore in hopes of picking up good winds , and they saw sights their landmen 's eyes had never seen before . When the sails were filled with wind a man could relax from rowing and enjoy the sea . Jr liked those moments best . Separated from past and future , isolated by time and space rather than inward alienation , he felt curiously freed of self as well . Amergin sat comfortably on a coil of rope with the harp on his lap and Ir called out suggestions for music , letting the sound sing through him and merge with the creaking of the sail , the smell of wet wood , the warm sun beating on his naked shoulders . Jr turned to look at his wife and the cluster of his children , two sturdy boys and a comely girl who would bring many bride gifts one day . Children . Odd small creatures . Would one of them turn on him eventually and become his enemy ? One of his boys was pointing and yelling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the grown man 's jaw dropped and he half-rose , staring . " A god , " he whispered in awe . Arnergin had seen it , too , and felt his body 's unconscious worship as the hair lifted on his scalp like a small forest surging toward the sun . He set Clarsah aside without even thinking of her . Who could think of anything but the gigantic being that rose effortlessly from the sea , ascending into sunlight as if it could make its home in any element it chose ? The creature was enormous ; the Gaels had no basis for comparison , for no land animal could rival it . Even Sakkar , who had heard of such things before , could only shake his head and stare . Staring was all any of them could do . Ir 's god erupted from the waves in a great fountain of flesh , slowly , with splendid majesty , describing a curve of pure grace with its immense body . It seemed to hang in the air beside Eremon 's galley . Jr saw its eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence and some dark and secret mirth , looking at him . But he was not frightened as he had been frightened by the gaze of the dead bull . He felt no malice in this being , only a sense of kinship . Here was life larger than life . Within the tabernacle of the god 's body a huge heart thundered.  |p322Then  the great mottled head , gleaming with strange phosphorescence , dove back toward the sea . The body arced , following , and a fluked tail lifted above the water , leaving the watchers with its imprint burned into their minds . " What was it ? " Eremon wondered , unable to believe his eyes . " We have seen a god , " Ir told him with finality . " A whale , " Sakkar said . His mouth was dry and his palms were wet . " A kind of sea monster . I have heard of such creatures beyond the Pillars , but the commander Age-Nor said those were stories to frighten children and we should ignore them . " " That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted . Amergin was inclined to agree with him . The bard recovered Clarsah , regretting belatedly that he had not held her up to share the experience . He found a place for himself and the harp behind a stack of crates , where no one would bother them and he could think . The whale  --  the god  --  was too large and too important to be dismissed from his mind until he had considered all it might symbolize . Considered , with awe , the gradations of existence , the truly infinitenumber of possibilities for rapture or horror represented by the incalculable number of beings nurturing sparks from the great spirit . A god had leaped out of the ocean gulf , confronting Amergin with the unsuspected , and he felt his mind spinning away down limitless vistas . Life , the all-encompassing and most sacred spirit , was a tremendousongoing explosion , its particles filling the void between worlds , animating not only tribes and trees and cattle but Ir 's god and the stars in the sky and creatures monumental and minute whose existenceAmergin had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beautiful oneness that contained both Clarsah and the sea god , he could distill it all into poetry , as the whale had created poetry for his eyes with its vibrant flesh . The flame of the word at the heart of creation . In a world of such transcendent wonder , what might not await them on Ierne ?  |p323THE  BEING TOGETHER of the Tuatha De Danann was heldunder difficult circumstances that season . A flare-up of hostilitywas reported from various parts of the island , one Fir Bolg tribe threatening another as well as skirmishing with Dananns along the fringes of Danann territory . " There will be war soon if we do not discourage them , " Cet of the Plow warned the others . " War again on the sacred island . Our Fir Bolg cousins are an aggressive people who have not yet outgrown their need for conflict ; they snatch things from one another like two babies in a box . They have forgotten that we could shrivel them where they stand and put an end to all their savagery . " Erin scowled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bolg of being savage in one breath , and threaten to turn the Earthkillers against them in the next as if that were not the ultimate savagery ? " " The Fir Bolg take great pleasure in war , " Cet said with condescension . " We do not ; we fight only to defend ourselves . That makes all the difference . " " Beware how you cry for war , no matter what the excuse , " warned Fodla the wise . " When there is keening on the night wind in the camps of the Iverni and the Velabri , there will be wailing likewise in the halls of the Tuatha De Danann . The pain we bring to others we can not escape ourselves . " " We have become too sensitive , perhaps , " Cuill suggested . " That is a weakness . " Fodla contradicted him . " Being able to feel the pain of others is a strength . It gives us incentive to avoid causing pain . " " Rather than endure this increasing hostility , we should intimidate the Mr Bolg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of them once , " said Cet . We can remind them ofp324the days when the red beam of the Sword of Light sliced the tops off mountains and the barking thunder of the Irresistible Spear rained fire on the forests . " " Reminding them would not be enough , " a Danann commented . " They would have to see for themselves . Their bards have failed to keep the past sufficiently alive in their memories . " Eriu insisted , " We must not use the Earthkillers again ! The earth is sacred ! " " If we take up the Sword of Light , can we resist using it ? " wonderedTuan , Keeper of the Legend . " For three generations we have limited ourselves to good stout bronze weapons and fought what battles we had to fight in the style of our ancestors , " brave Banba said . " Clean fighting , eye to eye . When a man can kill at no greater distance than he can hurl a javelin he has to bear the responsibility of his actions , for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget this talk of Earthkillers and continue to trust our bronze . " " Unless we start to lose , " Greine interjected somberly . " Everythingchanges when you start to lose . " " I am sick of this talk of winning and losing , " said Eriu . " Why do we need such words at all ? " " Ask Shinann , " said Fodla with a laugh , breaking the tension . " They may not even be in her vocabulary . " to . Odba sat in the bottom of her boat and watched the ridges of muscle clench and unclench on the sweating backs of her oarsmen . Turning her back on them , she squatted over the communal pot and tried to ignore the cramping of her bowels . The heaving surface of the sea had thrown off all the woman 's natural rhythms , but she refused to surrender to her discomfort . Her body would not tyrannize her ; her will would override it . So Odba thought , in the first hard grip of determination . " Try sitting on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your backside , " one of the oarsmen suggested with a laugh . " I did that , and the shock made everything let go ! " Odba pursed her lips and did not bother to answer . " Do n't tease her ; she 's a brave woman , " a Gael said to the rower who had first spoken . " I thought a laugh would make her feel better . "  | " Getting to Ierne is what will make her feel better . And the rest of us , too . Here , mind your oar , I 'm not going to pull my stroke and yours , too ! " By following the coastline they were assured of taking the same route the fleet was following , and they expected to find someone along the way who would have sighted such a large expedition and could give them further guidance if necessary . Odba had to be within sight of the other boats before they set out across the open sea , and to this end she insisted they row until the last light died and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-rewarded by Ferdinon , they might have resented her pushing them so . Two full days and two brief nights had elapsed before Odba 's momentumbegan to fail her . In the light of the third dawn she looked at the seemingly fragile boat , dwarfed by the immense gulf of water , and cold seeped into the hollow of her bones . Sickening cold compoundedfrom the unknown and anger at her own brashness . There was no mercy to be expected from the sea , who never asked mercy for herself . Ir , meanwhile , dreamed over his oars at the forefront of the fleet . He thought of the great body soaring up from the sea , and the eye , seekinghim out . The god had spoken to him . When it dived back into the water , the creature had sent up a silveryspray , fine as mist , prismatic in the sun . A rainbow trapped in its moist exhalation had marked the god 's return to the deep . The wind had blown the spray in a cloud that bathed Ir from head to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the image of the god enshrined in a rainbowcloud forever burned into his brain . Nothing would be the same for him again . A cloak of serenity envelopedhim , and secure in its peace he was able to look back at himself and realize how frenzied he had been . Envied all his life for his face and form , Ir had struggled from the beginning to live up to that surface splendor . Had tried desperately , knowing deep inside that he could never be as strong , nor as beautiful , nor as heroic as his appearance proclaimed ; fearing that others would discover how short the reality fell of the image . Ile had exhausted himself trying . His only standard of
