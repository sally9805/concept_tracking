In some cases , this dumping is sanctioned by the State Department of Environmental Conservation . In others , it is illegal or simply unregulated . Where it is sanctioned , the agency , because of limited funds and staffing , relies on the industries to monitor their own discharges. // The Hudson is a source of drinking water for many upstate communities - as well as for New York City on occasion - and is used by thousands of people each year for swimming and fishing . State officials , however , have warned against eating many species of fish from sections of the river contaminated by PCB ' s , or polychlorinated biphenyls , which are believed to cause cancer , and has banned all commercial fishing of striped bass. // Some dumping of toxic chemicals , including known carcinogens such as toluene and benzene , is allowed by Federal and state laws as long as it does not prevent the water from being used safely , Conservation Department officials say. // " If in fact we set zero pollution standards , we would not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Barolo , director of the department ' s division of water . <> <> Permits Allow Some Dumping // Permits issued by the state allow scores of industries and municipalities to dump toxic wastes into the river . For example , General Electric ' s silicone division in Waterford , near Albany , may discharge up to 105 pounds of toluene and 8 pounds of benzene daily . A pigment plant of the Ciba-Geigy Corporation , the pharmaceuticals company , in upstate Glens Falls may discharge up to 30 pounds of cyanide and 33 pounds of lead each day. // Over the last few years , the state ' s program to regulate the toxic discharges into New York waters has increasingly come under attack from environmentalists and some legislators . Environmentalists say they are worried not only about frequent violations of state regulations , but also about unregulated toxic chemicals leaking from landfills and pesticide runoff from farm land. // The increasing concern about toxic chemicals in the Hudson comes as environmentalists and state environmental officials agree that so-called conventional pollutants , such as fecal matter , have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financing of sewage treatment . <> <> A Matter of Intense Debate // The impact of toxic waste on the water quality of the river as well as on human health and animal life is a matter of intense debate . State health officials say that dilution of the toxic chemicals in the Hudson makes the water , with rare exceptions , safe to drink. // But the environmentalists say they are concerned that the toxic substances in the river pose an alarming threat . In many cases , they point out , state health standards consider substances dangerous at levels too low to be detected using available technology. // The problems of trying to improve the water quality in the Hudson point up the difficulties in reducing toxic wastes while maintaining a healthy economy and keeping down government expenses. // Environmentalists as well as some state officials are concerned that the state ' s regulations , which rely primarily on monitoring by the industries , do too little to prevent violations . They assert that in many cases , polluters , rather than public safety concerns , determine water quality. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , they ' re everyone ' s , " said State Assemblyman Maurice D. Hinchey , the Kingston Democrat who is head of the Environmental Conservation Committee of the Assembly . " We can still live in an industrial society and have a clean environment . We ' ve just got to commit ourselves to doing it . But the fact is that we have not yet done so . " <> <> Limits Set on Pollutants // State officials say that the state ' s water pollution control program , which sets limits on the amounts of certain toxic chemicals that industries and municipalities can dump into New York waterways , insures that the concentrations of these chemicals in the Hudson remain at safe levels . " The standard-setting process is incredibly conservative , " Mr. Barolo said. // Almost 200 , 000 people in seven communities regularly draw their drinking waterfrom the Hudson . In last year ' s drought , New York City took nearly 100 million gallons a day from the river to supplement city reservoirs . With rare exceptions , health officials say , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw their water from the Hudson say they are worried that in some cases violations go undetected by officials because the water is tested too infrequently . In one such case last year , high levels of an organic solvent were found in the water in Waterford , near Albany , only through chance testing by an independent researcher. // Over the last decade , environmentalists from several of the state ' s most prominent environmental groups , including the Environmental Defense Fund , the Clearwater , Scenic Hudson , the National Resource Defense Council and the Hudson River Fishermen ' s Association , have said they were concerned about the state ' s failure to regulate toxic chemicals in the river . <> <> System Is Criticized // " We ' re saying that the system does not appear to be working , " said John Mylod , executive director of the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater Inc. , an environmental group working to protect the Hudson . " You can ' t say everything is O.K. , when environmental quality analysis shows everything is not O.K. " // In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industries along the river between October 1981 and June 1984 , Clearwater found several dozen serious violations reported . But in only five of these cases did the department issue an order on consent , the department ' s equivalent of a court order. // Mr. Barolo said that in view of the department ' s limited resources , the department had found " informal agreements " with violators generally to be a more effective way to gain compliance than litigation or fines. // Officials in the Conservation Department said they believe that over the last two years , since they issued new water-quality standards and stepped up enforcement , the effectiveness of the state ' s pollution control program had increased . Department figures show that compliance with discharge permits increased to 76 percent in the second quarter of 1985 from 70 percent in the third quarter of 1984 . <> <> Economy vs . Environment // " Some people say , ' How can you let the other 24 percent go ? ' " Mr. Barolo said . " But we ' re making progress. " // Often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debated in terms of the state ' s environment versus its economy , with many politicians and labor leaders worried that more stringent pollution controls could cause major companies to leave the state. // Many industry groups have voiced opposition to the state ' s water pollution regulations , calling them a burden that threatens profitability. // Environmentalists and state officials worry about the cumulative effects of consuming water containing any concentration of toxic chemicals. // " People are not dropping in the streets , " Mr. Mylod said . " But there ' s chronic exposure , and we don ' t know what the effects are going to be. " // Mr. Barolo said that he too was concerned about the possible long-term effects of exposure to toxic chemicals . " Do I believe we ' re doing the best job that we can under the circumstances ? " he asked . " The answer is yes . Am I satisfied with where we ' ve been and what we ' re doing ? Absolutely not. " //            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
