It is a remarkable story of how a few hundred dissidents after decades of underground opposition and persecution under one of the fiercest Stalinist regimes in Eastern Europe came to head a group that has become a major political force in the country and the ' ' voice of the people , ' ' in the words of Vaclav Havel , the Forum ' s leader. // In the process , they have become to share power with their former Communist enemies , Mr. Havel could soon be the next president , and several of its members have entered the new coalition government. // The nucleus of Civic Forum consists of people who for years have fought together against the regime and who have learned to trust each other . The question now is how well they will function in a large , political organization . Much depends on Havel , the 53-year-old playwright who more and more is compared to Poland ' s Lech Walesa as a symbol for the renewal of the nation. // // ' ' It is important to get organized and to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading figure in Civic Forum . ' ' We must become a real political force and gather around us more nondissidents. ' ' // At the founding meeting , the goals of Civic Forum were quite limited and pertained only to the immediate crisis in the aftermath of the student demonstrations . But within a few days the Forum published a political program called ' ' What We Want ' ' in which it demanded wide-ranging political and economic reforms leading to a parliamentary democracy and a free-market economy . In next year ' s elections , it intends to advance its own slate of candidates. // The group was founded in chaos on Sunday , Nov. 19 , at a spur of the moment meeting in Cinoherni Klub , a theater in Prague. // The students at Charles University in Prague were preparing a big strike in protest against the savage beatings by the police two nights earlier during an otherwise peaceful and officially sanctioned demonstration . The atmosphere was intense. // ' ' Some people from Obroda ( reform Communists kicked out of the party after the Soviet-led invasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Jiri Hajek ( former foreign minister ) started to call different groups to come to a meeting that same evening , ' ' says Mr. Urban of the events. // ' ' Around 300 of us came , and I was surprised that we were able to hold the meeting at all , ' ' says Jaroslav Koran , a longtime activist who was present. // Ivan Gabal was also there , but he was quite turned off by what happened . The meeting was chaotic , he says . It was not work , it was show , it was theater , and there was no serious opportunity for discussion . Mr. Gabal is a sociologist and member of the Circle of Independent Intelligentsia , a group of many hundred intellectuals from within the power structure that participated in the forming of Civic Forum. // Other participants give similar accounts of the founding meeting of Civic Forum , and no one left with the impression that something historic had taken place. // The striking students sent only one representative , strike leader Martin Mejstrik , recalls Monika Pajerova @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dissidents , they lived in their world and we in ours , and we were also sort of tired of all dissident groups , she adds. // ' ' When Martin returned , we asked him what had happened , and he answered only that they had signed some kind of document , and then we forgot about the whole thing , ' ' says Ms. Pajerova . ' ' It was not until a couple of days later that we understood the importance of the meeting in Cinoherni Klub. ' ' // When Civic Forum was founded , all Czechoslovak dissident groups - around a dozen - finally succeeded in uniting under a common banner . Two previous attempts this year had failed for various reasons , and in the previous years , each group fought alone its own battle for survival. // ' ' But now it was clear to us that it was either them or us , ' ' explains Urban .

He is the head of the main working group , jokingly called HVP - holka pro vsechno - a jack of all trades . The activity is hectic , people run in and out , everybody is talking , documents and papers overflow desks and floors . Along one wall , there are 55 shoe cartons serving as mailboxes for the leading Forum members . Urban describes the situation with a big smile as ' ' uncontrolled avalanche. ' ' // In the crisis staff , there is a group of advisers that consists of Havel , Sasa Vondra , and Jiri Krizan . They are two of Havel ' s closest friends . Mr. Vondra is a young computer programmer , who earlier this year spent 50 days in jail for his role as spokesman for Charter 77 , the human rights group that published its manifesto in January 1977 .

And no one talks any more of dissolving it . On the contrary , all signs point to the Forum becoming a permanent factor in Czechoslovak society , and maybe even becoming a political party one day . Certainly , it is already the nation ' s most-important political movement. // ' ' All of Czechoslovakia now depends on these dissidents ' ability to learn to become professional politicians , ' ' says Gabal. // But with all success of the group , there are also the first signs of strained relations within Civic Forum , and its unity will be tested even more in the coming months leading up to the elections .
