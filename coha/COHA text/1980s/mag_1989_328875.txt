Just when corporate raider Paul Bilzerian seems to have hit rock bottom , his fall from grace goes even farther . Last month Bilzerian , 39 , was convicted by a Manhattan jury on nine counts of securities fraud , which carry a potential 45-year prison sentence and $2.25 million in fines . Then last week the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil lawsuit accusing him of illegal stock transactions involving seven companies , including his 1988 takeover of Singer . The charges range from lying to the SEC about how he financed his raids to trying to hide the number of shares he owned . In its suit , the SEC asks for repayment of more than $31 million in allegedly illegal profits . While denying the new charges , Bilzerian last week resigned as chairman of Singer , a post he had held for just 18 months . <P> The SEC accuses four of Bilzerian 's associates of helping him conceal his financial dealings . Three of them , including shopping-mall magnate Edward DeBartolo Sr. of Youngstown , Ohio , have already settled without admitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contractor that manufactures weapons- control systems , in poor financial shape . To pay off more than $1 billion he borrowed to acquire the company , Bilzerian sold eight of the company 's twelve divisions . A group of 9,000 retirees has filed a $235 million lawsuit against the company , accusing Bilzerian of plundering Singer 's pension plan . The U.S. Government is suing the company for defense-contract fraud , seeking $231 million in damages . <P> None of that has slowed construction on Bilzerian 's new eleven-bedroom , 21- bath house in an exclusive suburb north of Tampa . Expected to cost as much as $10 million , the 36,866-sq. - ft. home will include a basketball court complete with bleachers and electronic scoreboards.
