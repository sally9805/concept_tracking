The services are as enthusiastic and emotional as they 've always been , and now there are literally hundreds of quality educational opportunities connected to camp meeting . Noted theologians come to lead seminars , and multilingual services are conducted for international delegates , " Gone are the " canvas tabernacles " and the old meeting hall blanketed with straw to muffle the noise of the crowd . Instead , efficient cafeteria facilities , a 7,500-seat domed auditorium and sprawling grounds adjacent to Anderson College await the stream of RVs that converge for a week every June . On any given night during camp meeting the music portion of the service may be led by some of the best-known names in contemporary gospel music . The Church of God , which has always stressed song as a vital part of worship , claims among its ranks the veteran recording artist Doug Oldham and the Grammy winners Sandi Patti and the Bill Gaither Trio . This willingness to share talents to promote the nondenominational message of the Scriptures has been a Church of God tradition since the movement was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniel S. Warner . Preaching with an overpowering sense of mission , Warner called for Christians to denounce bitter sectarian rivalries and dogmatic creedalism . His persuasive message and magnetism quickly attracted thousands of followers . The swelling ranks of believers , who now number 728,000 , were an independent lot who refused to call their movement a denomination and to this day do not practice " church joining " or formal membership procedures . " The beautiful , noncreedal openness of the Church of God gives all of us the freedom to find a scriptural base for our own life , " says Gloria Gaither , the daughter of a Church of God pastor and the recipient of Songwriter of the Year honors from the Gospel Music Association , " The fact that the Church of God does not rely on a formal doctrinal statement allows thinking , creative people to function in a loving , nonrestrictive , nonlegalistic manner . The emphasis is on unity , on embracing all believers . You ca n't put a box around God or wall God 's people off from one another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning in this early photo , the church 's annual camp meeting is still a festive affair that now attracts 30,000 annually . The pretty , white-haired lady in the second row on the aisle raised her hand . " Does n't what you 're saying violate the separation of church and state ? " she asked . Dark , cavernous Bovard Auditorium on the University of Southern California campus was heavy with heat . The wide-open side doors admitted not a trace of breeze as we wrestled with the issues of a religion-related seminar . For a moment I stared at the lectern and let her words echo in my mind . Was she hostile ? Was she " out to get me " following my exhortation to stand for truth  --  Biblical truth  --  in all of society , including government ? I detected no hidden daggers , merely concern . " I wonder if you 're aware that that phrase is not in the Constitution ? " 1 asked . She looked up at me uncertainly . I said it again : " The Constitution does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I could not hear her voice , but her lips plainly asked , " It does n't ? " " No , it really does n't . You see , we 've bought a lie , " I said . I paused for a second . That was pretty strong  --  but I was right . " We 've let the phrase go unchallenged for so long that most people assume it 's in the Constitution . And it is n't , " I continued . This lady was obviously educated and concerned . But , despite the roaring controversy over " religion and politics " last year , she had n't learned that " separation of church and state " Editor 's note : Bob Slosser , a former New York Times editor and the president of CBN University , is a recognized authority on politics and religion . The author of numerous books , he is a lecturer in journalism and writing . is an extraconstitutional expression . And she is by no means alone in her misunderstanding . The section of the Constitution at issue is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendments adopted December 15 , 1791 , as the Bill of Rights . It reads : " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . . . " What was the intention of the Founding Fathers in framing and adopting these words ? The language seems quite clear despite the efforts of some specialists to turn it into mud . The early Americans feared the forced establishment of a national church . Rooted in Reformation history and versed in the practices of the Church of England and of other national churches , they insisted on religious liberty . Thus they wrote : " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion . " But they did n't stop there . The next clause makes it clear they had no intention of outlawing religious expression in public life  --  one of the reasons they wrote that Congress should make no law " prohibiting the free exercise " of religion . The written thought and the utterances of the people who launched this nation on its course show that secularization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was coercion or oppression of religious belief , not the removal of religious expression . They operated from a Biblical world view  --  a Biblical culture  --  and spoke knowingly and consistently of " Providence , " the " Creator , " " nature 's God " and the like . They knew they were including Almighty God in their deliberations about the future of this country . Washington went so far as to declare to the warrior chiefs of the Delaware Indian nation : You do well to wish to learn our arts and ways of life , and above all , the religion of Jesus Christ . These will make you a greater and happier people than you are . Congress will do everything they can to assist you in this wise intention . . . . Washington , acting at the request of the same Congress that passed the Bill of Rights , also proclaimed a " day of public thanksgiving and prayer , to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many and signal favors of Almighty God .

Robin Roberts Panama : Gatun Down to Cruising The Americans who dredged , blasted and hacked their way across the Isthmus of Panama from 1907-1914 did their job so well that a cruise ship on the Panama Canal goes through " the big trench " now the same way the first ship did on August 15 , 1914 . As your cruise ship approaches the canal from either side of the continent , you 'll see what looks like a seagoing tollgate . What you 're really viewing is the first in a series of locks that , along with its various lakes and rivers , comprise this engineering wonder . Still , the analogy to a tollgate is valid : Every ship pays a toll based on tonnage to the Panama Canal Company in return for the privilege of taking the " shortcut " rather than the treacherous trip around Cape Horn on the southernmost tip of South America . Look down from the railing of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the land bordering each side of the locks . On both sets of track are " mules " towing locomotives that pull the ship through the locks . Then the strange part : Two men in rowboats approach from both sides of the bow and throw up lines secured to the deck . They row back to shore and attach the other ends to the mules ; soon , as the water levels in the locks even out , you 're pulled through . The locks , each 1,000 feet long and shaped like giant bathtubs , take up a surprisingly small amount of the canal 's length . Gatun Lake , one of the largest man-made lakes in the world and bordered by lush , tropical jungle , occupies most of the waterway 's 51-mile distance . More than any other part of the Panama Canal , the eight-mile-long Gaillard Cut gives the impression of an enormous , man-made ditch . It was blasted through solid rock ; the subsequent landslides killed many of the workers . A Panama Canal transit , eight to nine hours , is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regardless of the line you 're traveling on , make stops on both sides of the continent . On the Pacific end , the two most popular ports are Acapulco and Cabo San Lucas . However , the stops on the eastern side of the Americas  --  Cartagena , Colombia and the San Bias Islands off the Panamanian coast  --  are far more interesting . Cartagena 's beauty is its contrast between the old and the new . Ancient battlements that protected the place from seagoing pirates surround the exotic , old city 's narrow , cobblestoned streets , easygoing people and shops with pungent smells . Visit the high-rise dwellings and the gem shops , in the newer section of the city , and hold the most exquisite emerald you 've ever seen . If your pocketbook is so inclined , you can also buy one at a very good price . Less than a day 's cruising time from Cartagena are the San Blas Islands , where you 'll meet the Kuna Indians , a pre-Columbian culture whose women still swathe their limbs in complex bracelets of colored beads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung round their necks in elaborate jewelry . The Kunas are hard bargainers , but their native molas ( reverse applique panels of cloth with intricate design ) are a rare prize . ? Fred Rosen The United States : Whistiin ' Dixie and Other Tunes Unregenerate stick-in-the-muds , sufferers from seasickness , provincials , those bored by reggae and voodoo , the tuxedo-less , rabid xenophobes and easy sunburners  --  READ ON ! You do n't have to leave the continental United States to take a full-feature , every-care-provided-for cruise . We 're talking about Maine , the New England islands , the heart of the old Confederacy  --  in short , some of the most historic and scenic spots America can offer . One beauty of cruising is its combination of destinations that would be unfeasible or unthought-of in the average travel itinerary . An outstanding example is American Cruise Lines ' " New England Islands Cruise , " a seven-day jaunt that would otherwise involve too many cab , ferry and plane changes for even the hardiest traveler to contemplate without flinching . No flinching 's involved when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England on the M.S. Savannah , another of the new generation of " minicruisers . " Informality is the keynote , the cabins are considerably more spacious than those of the larger liners and you do n't suffer any culture shock when you step ashore into the eager embrace of " natives " waiting for your cash . Fogs swirl in and out of these islands at a moment 's notice ; sunbathers and photographers are at their mercy , and cruise passengers may find their itinerary temporarily postponed , or even changed  --  but not to worry . The distances between stops on these cruises are so much less vast than the Caribbean 's that your captain will have no difficulty getting all your destinations in . And a colorful sprinkling of Americana they are . To my mind , Newport , Rhode Island , provides one of the widest panoramas of any American community , from its harbor choked with sailboats and framed by the bridge , to its colonial-era ' port                 @ @ @ @
