Music intro . Two Celtic queens cross the Irish Sea on a raft . Other members of their tribe are unconscious and lashed to the raft . This scene should be played suspended over audience in center ring , either on trapeze or a device to give height . Unseen people below can manipulate ropes of the trapeze or flying harness holding the women , or it may also be played stationary but aloft , with the two women held up by actors or stagehands dressed in black . The two have to fight to hold their equilibrium during the stormy crossing . Their voices are fierce and commanding , with extremely harsh " R 's ' in the accents , but also warmth and humor should come through . Storm sounds throughout scene can be produced by wind chimes , rolled cymbal , thunder machine , synthesized wind , etc . MOTHER JONES Did you lash down the males ? BAILEY Yes , Mother . MOTHER JONES Be sure their mouths are cleared . Seaweed can stop their breathing . BAILEY Cut five more loose yesterday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me see them . Sometimes I can bring them back . BAILEY We'd 've capsized if I did n't let go the weak and the dead . We have two suckling boys . The mothers have sewn the boys ' feet to the sides of their own thighs so the babes ca n't wash overboard . O Mother , I 've never faced such a pressured sea . MOTHER JONES The barbarians will stay where it 's easy to steal . They wo n't be following where we 're going  --  it 's too hard to get there . BAILEY Mother , I love you so . Let me stand against the storm and spell you . If you hold my hand I 'll be able to feel the way to steer . MOTHER JONES I ca n't see it but I smell the land . Look there , the kelp . Look there , the small fish BAILEY The storm wants to throw us back . MOTHER JONES No , we 'll make land with at least one male in good condition .

MOTHER JONES Meave , Maya , Mary , hold on to my hair . The sea is high and killing . BAILEY Mother , am I steering in the right direction ? MOTHER JONES Yes , I 'll close my eyes for a while . BAILEY Stay near , in case I get in trouble . MOTHER JONES ( Warmly ) p. 3 @x Circus music , band . A collage of circus sound , old and not so old songs and patriotic tunes . The medley possibilities are : " Old Gray Mare , " " There 'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight , " " Dixie , " " Battle Hymn of the Republic , " " Camptown Races , " " Yankee Doodle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Railroad , " " Union Maid , " " Rings on Her Fingers and Bells on Her Toes . " MOLLIE enters leading the opening extravaganza of the show to " Diamonds from the Stars . " She flashes her large diamonds as she drives her carriage around the ring . She wears an elegant long gown of blue and silver ( it has many breakaway sections for fast costume changes ) . Her black hair shines in the glittering kerosene lights . She beams and lovingly welcomes the crowd with her eyes and mouth , she recognizes people she met last year , and pantomimes their names , as music blares . She nods , and has special waves and winks for children and young people . She salutes the older members of the audience . Her carriage may be pulled by two actors dressed all in white with spangles , moving as horses . MOLLIE drives her carriage to the band stand , stands up in her carriage and addresses the audience , music under .

Kisses it , holds it one more time , and then moves onto the next body . ) Goodbye , my darlings . We 'll meet again . So many of us have died there are crosses and crosses .

My husband was an iron moulder and a staunch member of the Iron Moulders Union . The victims of yellow fever were mainly among the poor and the workers . The rich fled the city . People were not allowed to enter the house of a yellow fever victim without permits . The dead surrounded us . They were buried at night quickly and without ceremony .

My Daddy ca n't read but he tanned my hide to make sure I would . p. 29 MOTHER JONES I have a paper here 'll help educate you , lad  --  " Appeal to Reason "  --  It 's addressed to young men like you who need to know the truth and want to better themselves . What 's your Daddy do for a living ? SOLDIER Hired man , M'am  --  that 's why I joined the militia . No way to get land myself far as I could see . MOTHER JONES Tell you what I 'll do , son . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Appeal to Reason . " You get the truth from this paper  --  the Omaha Morning Herald just prints the lies and handouts of the Robber Baron Railroad Land grabbers and the Capitalist Corporate Robbers . You help me sell more subscriptions among the barrack mates and I 'll see you get 5 for yourself on every sale you make . SOLDIER Yes , M'am ! MOTHER JONES You wo n't have any trouble selling , son  --  because you are getting out the word of truth  --  to every one of your friends . You soldiers are all the sons of working men and you got to have the facts of life close at hand if you 're ever to get your proper share of the wealth of this great country . Shall we have another dram ? Lights fade . Circus training ring : BIRDA , MOLLIE &amp; BIRDA 's horse . BIRDA Mother , I 'm having such a good time today . I 'm allowing myself to say everything that comes into my head . It 's so much fun , it makes me feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice vacation for you , my darling , but do learn which people to do that with . BIRDA With you , Mother , with you and my beautiful horse . BAILEY Yes , my darling Birda , you train yourself right and then you 'll have the power to train your animal . ( Kissing her on forehead ) This is the first animal you get to organize , then you can do it with fourfooted ones . BIRDA , alone with her horse , as the band plays " Shenandoah . " She is trying to teach her horse to dance . The horse is played by one person . She will mount the horse by end of scene and go off stage and out of room at a flying gallop . BIRDA I can walk , and you can walk . I can tie my shoelaces , and I know for certain that I can tell the time my dear , my beautiful beast . How I love my beast . I love you . I love your shining coat , and your eyes melt my heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I only pretended to be able to tell the time . Yes , there 's a beast , oh how beautiful you will be when you know all the steps , yes , there 's my beast . Oh my beast you have a beautiful way of bowing on the beat . I want to fly with you . Just you learn to dance and then we will sneak away just you and I and we 'll go out to the lush green bayous down by the river , and I 'll bathe the sweat off your beautiful strong and perfect backside . Oh you do have a marvelous bottom my beast . I adore your magnificent and monarchly head but I have to tell you how I also adore your behind . Yes , there 's a beast , that 's my beast , my beast is beautiful , my beast is a beauty . Yes , raise your foot again my beauty , just ever so such a shade higher , yes , my beauty . I love you to do it that way . Yes , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying , go back to the beginning my perfection and then , right , right , yes there 's my beauty . How grand you will be in your harness , I 'll make you the most shining and perfect , and you know between you and I , you are the true star of my circus . Yes , there 's my  --  no , no , darling , go back , you 've nearly got it , yes again , again , perfect . ( Hugs horse passionately , throws herself up on horse 's back , throws down her training whip . ) Now we 'll gallop all the way out to the cliffs above the river and we 'll fly right off and up into the sky . We 'll fly , we 'll fly Circus music up. @x MOTHER JONES The circus tent is dark . From a distance we hear MOTHER JONES ' voice singing as she walks to keep herself company . She carries a lantern to light her way , or she is lit by moonlight that follows her like a new moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into view as she sings . She walks across the stage and out and exits , still singing , and then reappears at another exit , walks cross the other side of the stage and disappears through another exit singing . Nothing else happens but night sounds , rushing water sounds , moonlight , or lantern light , and MOTHER JONES singing . The singing trails off in the distance on the exit  --  but it should have feeling of a continuous song rather than one with a " set " ending . She might also be dodging bullets from unseen guns as she goes . MOTHER JONES ( Sings " I Was Born in Revolution " ) I was born in revolutionin revolution will I stay . ( Spoken ) Till I soften the hardened heartsof the Capitalist CorporationsTo the miners ' rightTo an eight hour day.I was born in revolutionSome eighty years ago , In the rainbow greens of Ireland 's Dream ( Pause ) ( Spoken ) To throw the Murderers outAnd set us againon the dancing pathWhere once we 'd beenBefore the British slammedtheir military down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queens and Herosto hide down in the cavesof our swollen hearts .

I was born to be with you in revolution.I was born to serve you in revolutionI was born in revolution Listen to me boysMother is with you And I 'll never leave you. Till we 've seen these troubles through MOTHER JONES ' voice trails off as she hums or whistles . p. 33 END SCENE p. 34 Act 2 , Scene 2 Scene 2 EUGENE , the eldest son of MOLLIE and GUS , brings in the woman he wants to marry . Throughout this scene , other children and circus members can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recede to other areas of focus according to director 's discretion . EUGENE Mother Father Mrs. Bailey and Mr. Bailey MY DEAR PARENTS I want to present to you a creature who has captured my heart and soul . The woman shyly comes forward and bows to MOLLIE and GUS . EUGENE ( Continues ) We met after the last show . She fell in love with my reflection in the light of the sound of my coronet playing , just like you said it would be , Mother . BAILEY Who said that ? GUS You must have told him the story of how you fell in love with me . BAILEY It takes two to Polka . GUS I 'd rather Schottische . BAILEY Hello , little lady , can you dance ? BRIDE I twirl , Madam . BAILEY That 's usually involved in most dances . p. 35 BRIDE Your son is so handsome . BAILEY He 's a loving son . BRIDE He 's a fine musician . BAILEY He 's growing all the time . That 's the great thing about having children  --  seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for a little while GUS Do you play or dance ? The BRIDE displays whatever form of play , tricks , gifts the woman playing the part has within her , i.e. , singing-tumbling-etc . GUS ( Looking at MOLLIE ) She could work out very well . BAILEY I like your skin . I see your eyes are clear and earnest . I love my son , and I want him to be as happy as I am with my husband , but there is one other thing we have to get to if you 're to join our family  --  our work . BRIDE I love Eugene , I 'll cook for him , I 'll keep his clothes , I 'll make him happy , I 'll learn his favorite foods . BAILEY ( Matter-of-fact ) It 's a hard life , but it 's clean . We care for ourselves and we love the folks who support us . We see the same folks every year and we give them a show that 's more than they paid for . p. 36 EUGENE Mother , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're full of love . You were brought up that way . But not everyone has been so fortunate as to have me , your Mother Mollie , and my darling , your Father Gus , and our dear neighbors the audience as a constant teacher . BRIDE I 'm pious , I pray to God . I pray for guidance . And I pray to our ancestors to help me carry on . BAILEY I like the tone of your voice . I love the tilt of your smile , and I adore the color of your skin . It 's sunny even when the clouds are out . But some folks would think this circus is a hard life , and I do n't want to mislead you . BRIDE I 'm a very good girl . I 'm so in love with your son . EUGENE That 's why we must be married . GUS But you 're so young . BAILEY And so were we . GUS Fourteen was old in those days ; most people died by twenty . BAILEY We live longer now , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spines him . Eugene gets carried away and sometimes he could evaporate , no one can play coronet like him . Oh , please , do let them get married , and we 'll have one more instead of one less . p. 37 GUS She 's so lovely , and she 'll make lovely children like you did . BAILEY Flattery will get you everywhere witness nine children ! All the other children come forward and improvise a small trick , stunt , or tiny improvisation with the bride as the others speak . The animals too come to sniff her out . EUGENE Mother , you ran away when you were a child so you could marry father . BAILEY I was born when I was already ten thousand years old . EUGENE I give up ! BAILEY I adore you . EUGENE I love you too , mother , and I want you to love the woman I love . BAILEY I want to , but there 's a lot at stake . EUGENE I thought love was all . BAILEY That 's a saying . A good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road , day after day without diminishing one 's soul , are you sure she 's what you want . She could be a profound intrusion . EUGENE She 'll expand me ! She has a beautiful soul , so clean , so pure , so white . BAILEY ( To audience and all ) Right away I 'm alarmed ! p. 38 EUGENE But those are all perfect qualities . GUS To a tent preacher , but not to us ! BAILEY Your father is right . EUGENE She has a clean soul . BAILEY Then do n't marry her . EUGENE I do n't understand you . BAILEY You can marry her if her soul is as patched as our tent . EUGENE Mother , why are you trying to hurt me when I 'm most in love ? BAILEY Because I do love you . GUS First born , love child . We love you . We want you to have the love we 've had . EUGENE Do you have to say all this in front of her ? BAILEY It 's in front of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GUS Look , son , if we have to watch what we say , we ca n't be who we are . And if you do n't want to be who we are ; then , you 'll have to think about going away . EUGENE But this is my life and I want her for my wife . She has a pure soul . BAILEY Is that the way you think about yourself , too ? p. 39 EUGENE ( A tiny bit smug ) I certainly hope so . MOLLIE looking at GUS and shrugging . They kiss , and holding hands , do a motion polka as the following speech occurs led by MOLLIE . GUS comes in on certain lines , chosen by you , the director , at crucial points , on a different musical note , so that it gives the effect of minor-key harmony without any written music . MOLLIE , the lead speaker , with GUS , and sometimes the children coming in exactly or a little bit late on certain lines , to make speaking music . BAILEY My son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a good life , and fine audiences and our business increases year by year is because we do n't skimp on love . We pull out all the stops for spirit . We enhance our private dramas , sing our pain , and we catapult our pleasure from cannons . Gunpowder is reversed , but at the same time we do not kid ourselves that there is only one dimension to this place . And our entire contract with God is working toward that state of promised grace . Please Eugene ! I love you , but do n't forget , I 'm your mother and I know you . You think I love only the good in you ? You think to sell us your bride , by showing only her pure points . That 's not what circus is all about . Where are the falls ? Falling and almost falling and recovering from falling . That 's our job . p. 40 EUGENE She 's good . BAILEY Stop harping on that . Find out the worst . Most people are so short-sighted they assume that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul and a transmitter between this world and the next , can not be only someone 's , anyone 's , my one 's , your one 's , idea of what is good ; it must also embody bad , bumbling , belligerance , balderdash bereavement , beauty , black and bruised as well as the sunny side of the street . If the soul is a soul that is whole , it must be made up of all aspects , dark and light , of the human/animal possibilities . EUGENE ( Frightened and almost exasperated ) Mother you ask for everything ! BAILEY You bet your bottom boots and why NOT ? ? ? ? A moment as they look at each other . EUGENE Mother and Father , I see she 's too good for us . And I 'm going to marry her , no matter what you say . MOLLIE and GUS smile and kiss each other and then EUGENE and his BRIDE to be , much to their bewilderment . MOLLIE and GUS sing together and do a soft shoe to a shortened verions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GUS ( To the tune of " I Had a Dream Dear " ) In that case , we give  --  Our consent to you  --  We had that dream dear , Our son , it was of you.Come here , our darlings , dance to  --  Bailey 's circus time.Fun is our dream dearWill you give it time MOLLIE at the end of the dance addresses audience . p. 41 BAILEY My friends , I know it is necessary that we all pray for , and love , as well as , respect the dead , but please , do n't forget to play with the young . BLACKOUT MOTHER JONES and three children are walking down the railroad tracks . CHILD There 's our house , up there , Mother Jones . MOTHER JONES You 're sure you have room for me ? BOY We only got one bed . GIRL But there 's enough room for you . CHILD You 'll keep us warm . MOTHER JONES Ah , the floor will do fine . My handbag will be my pillow . CHILD I want to carry it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is round , the stars are round , and you have the darling round face of a dear cherub . CHILD ( Running around MOTHER JONES ) I 'm round . BOY I 'm tall .

CHILD Short do n't keep me from being round . CHILD runs around her sister and brother singing " We 're round , we 're round , we 're all round .

WOMAN Three days . Went back to the mill this morning . The Boss was good and saved my place . MOTHER JONES When did you leave ? WOMAN The boss was good , he let me off early the night the baby was born . MOTHER JONES Where 's your husband ? WOMAN My darling , bless his soul , is in heaven these five months now . p. 43 MOTHER JONES What do you do with the baby while you work ? WOMAN Oh , the boss is good and he lets me have a little box with a pillow in it beside the loom . The baby sleeps there and when he cries , I nurse it . MOTHER JONES ( Reaching for baby and holding it ) Ah darlin ' so you 've listened to the whiz and whir of machinery before you came into the world , and now you 're here , your dear ears hear nothing but the incessant racket of the machines raining down on this wee skull like iron rain  --  and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at six years , bringing ten cents a day home to Mama ? ( To the MOTHER ) How much do you earn ? WOMAN ( Looking down ) Mother , after food and rent is taken out , our wages leaves nothing left over from a whole year 's work . MOTHER JONES I 'm going to get you out of here to a town where you can start over . WOMAN But we ca n't leave . We 're in debt . MOTHER JONES Do you want to see your babies die here in front of your eyes ? WOMAN No , Mother , no . MOTHER JONES I 'll take you to another state ! You can start again  --  free and clear  --  a fighting chance at last p. 44 WOMAN Oh , Mother , I 'm afraid . BOY They 'll shoot us if we try to run away . MOTHER JONES We 're catching the midnight train . WOMAN But I have no cash . MOTHER JONES Neither do I. ( Conspiring and laughing , and giving back the baby and hugging them all ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll take us to another city ; we 'll invent you a new name and get you a fresh start . That 's how we settle debts with slave masters . Hurry darlins ' ; let 's bundle up your things . When it 's pitch black , we 'll sneak down to the tracks and wait for our friends As lights fade down , sound of train approaching in distance . A circus tent , lights up on rehearsal trapeze . The others are working out  --  setting up their acts , etc . MINNIE keeps falling or losing her grip on the trapeze or missing her flips . BIRDA gives her a searching look . MINNIE Birda , Birda , am I love sick or do I have Spring fever ? BIRDA Six of one , half dozen of the other . MINNIE Ca n't work , I 'm off in a dream . This morning I fell off the trapeze . ( She rubs her head ) p. 45 BIRDA ( Feeling MINNIE 's head ) That 's an ostrich egg . Who 's the bird dog ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about it before you crack your skull . MINNIE But he wants me to quit the circus . BIRDA What can he do ? MINNIE He catches more catfish than anyone else in his county . BIRDA What else ? MINNIE He makes me dizzy . BIRDA The fall made you dizzy . MINNIE No , I was thinking of him . I see his body walking everywhere . BIRDA Toward you or away ? MINNIE That 's what frightens me . Every time I think about him , I see him walking away from me  --  and  --  ( She demonstrates ) MINNIE ( Singing ) He has such a manly walk , And one of the foremostOf his many charmsIs the way blond hair growsOn his thick strong arms ; A dimple flashes here near his chinWhen he locks my eyes and grinsHis mind melting grin ; His beauty is such a glorious shockI want to cleave to him nowAs my only rock ; But what really causes my loving heart to knockIs the way his broad shoulders swayWhen my manly man walksHis manly walk . p. 46 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . MINNIE I 'm so love sick , I ca n't move . Ca n't play my horn , I do n't want to eat . I ca n't think . BIRDA And you ca n't talk They laugh together . MINNIE Do you think mother and dad would be upset if I quit ? BIRDA Why ca n't he join us ? MINNIE He feels sorry for us . BIRDA That settles it . MINNIE I should marry him ? BIRDA Forget him . MINNIE But I 'm lovesick ! BIRDA Sounds painful . Go back to work . MINNIE I should have expected you to act this way . You have a young man in every other town . I fear you 'll never settle down and be faithful . BIRDA Settle down ! I see myself more settled than any of you , except mother . Settle down ! I love work . I love our animals and I am faithful , I have the greatest feeling of fidelity to our audiences . I 've never had an accident in public . Knock on wood ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The people know us . They 're our friends and they trust us to lift up their spirits . Once a year they can get out of the mud and see some color , some light wholesome fun and fine music , and some mighty excellent performing . We 're getting better every year . p. 47 MINNIE You equate love of your work with love of a man ? BIRDA What could be the difference ? MINNIE We 're created in God 's image . BIRDA When man gets as much sense as animals , I 'll take another look at him . MINNIE Birda , you do n't like anything unless it has fur or feathers . BIRDA You 're right . ( Sings " His Horsey Walk " ) He has such a majestic walk ; And one of the foremost of his many charmsIs the way white hair growsOn his thick forelockA dimple flashes here near his noseWhen he locks my eyes and snortsI vault to his back leaping only from my toesHis beauty is such a glorious shockI love him from his big brown eyesTo his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart to knockIs the way his broad rump swaysWhen my majestic horse walksHis horsey walk .

( She laughs and pets MINNIE 's face ) You are growing up . Your beautiful skull is beginning to show . These cheekbones are especially fine p. 48 MINNIE Do you think you 'll ever fall in love ? BIRDA You little monkey ! I 've been in love ever since I was placed alive on mother 's breast . Who else has trained canaries to sing like Metropolitan Opera stars ? Who else has taught a wild horse to dance like Pavlova who else ( Her voice fades as they walk into next scene ) Reprise : " His Manly Walk/His Horsey Walk " A man confronts MOTHER JONES as she leads a parade of striking Mine Workers ' children .

I was a grubbing miner too MOTHER JONES You 're a working man no more , Jack Buck  --  You 're an Empire ! MINE OWNER I built all the mines in this hollow with my own two hands . MOTHER JONES If you did that with those hands alone , you 'd be B.S.ing with God by now and not with me . You 've stolen this land and I watched you do it . p. 49 MINE OWNER You know , you 're the only woman I ever cared a snap about  --  I still want to marry you  --  We 've been as close as bugs in a rug in the past . MOTHER JONES Past is past . I look at you now and I see " Boss "  --  " King "  --  " Boss " ! You 've crossed over the line and stolen from your own class , you low down dirty son-of-a-bitch , we 'll whip you yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mary , how can you treat me like this when you 've shared my bed ? MOTHER JONES That 's a wishful , dirty , willful lie ! MINE OWNER I 'll tell the miners how you slept with me and cried my name thirteen times before the dawn . Mary , you made me so proud I marked the tally on the wall . You 're a mighty woman , Mary Harris Jones and I want you back in my bed . MOTHER JONES Mule Shit means more to me than you do  --  You turncoat robber bastard of British spawn ! MINE OWNER I 'm as Irish as you , Mary Harris . MOTHER JONES That 's another lie . I see nothing but British Buckingham written all over your two faces . MINE OWNER Mary , dear , Ah I love the flash in your eyes  --  go away now and leave my men alone . You know me , you know my company will take care of them . p. 50 MOTHER JONES Leave them under the care of your company , hey ? ( She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in your little package , my darlin ' ? GIRL ( shyly ) Apples from the company store , Mother . MOTHER JONES ( Opening bag and then with fire in her eyes , she tells MINE OWNER ) See ! ( Shows to all around ) Here is a pound of dried apples . Rotten . Look at these rotten apples crawling with worms . Worms ! You make your workers sweat 14 hours a day and you have the gall to sell them worms . Death alone will make me give the care of these poor souls to you . For shame Jack Buck . You 're a thief and a traitor . A traitor to your own class . MINE OWNER You wo n't be here long , there 's a $1000 price on your head . MOTHER JONES That 's another lie you stingy bastard . The price on my head is $5,000 . BLACKOUT Spotlight up on MOLLIE . She addresses the audience . BAILEY Ladies and Gentlemen : We will show you how to work . Some people have put forward the notion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to make decisions , do n't understand logic , nor can they even tell a story with a beginning and a middle and an end . I confess , to the last accusation , because the way I see it the story has no beginning and it not only has n't ended for me , it 's always starting all over again . In fact , ladies , gentlemen are n't interested in this sort of knowledge . What I want to tell the ladies is , that the way to stay young , to have eternal life and long eyelashes and beautiful skin , is not to paste yourselves up with creams and poltices , but to start over . Take a risk on yourself ; Mother Mary Harris Jones is one first class risk taker  --  that 's why I want our dear friends  --  our audience , to experience her . She has a different way of living in this world than do I and a different philosophy of life  --  she gave away her money as she made it while I bought a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to make sure no one could keep me from playing if I wanted to . They ca n't run you off your own land . Sometimes to minimize danger you have to take risks , change your address , let it all go , move on  --  the essence of staying young is to start all over again . That goes for heavenly and human bodies . I think we can all agree  --  IT 'S ABOUT TIME ! p. 51 LIGHTS DIM TIME SHIFT One of the first phones rings in the dark . MOTHER JONES Hello ! HAGGERTY ( On line ) Oh , Mother , come over quick and help us . The boys are that despondent . They 're going back Monday MOTHER JONES I 'll be there . I 'm holding a meeting here tonight , but I 'll leave at daybreak . Lights come up . MOTHER JONES walking into light carrying a lantern . MAN ( Rigid with fright ) You Mother Jones ? MOTHER JONES Yes , I 'm Mother Jones . MAN The superintendent told me that if you came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he did n't want to see you ' round these parts . MOTHER JONES Tell that superintendent  --  I 'm not come to see him . I 'm coming to see the miners . ANOTHER MAN ( Runs up to MOTHER JONES  --  he is skin and bones ) Do you see these cars over there , Mother ? ( Pointing ) On the siding ? We made a contract with the coal company to fill those cars for so much , and after we had made the contract , they put lower bottoms in the cars , so they 'd hold yet another ton . I 've worked for this company all my life and all I have now is this worn-out frame . p. 52 MOTHER JONES Lead me to the hall , I 'm holding a meeting . MAN Wo n't let us use the hall . Company owns it . MOTHER JONES The church ? ANOTHER MAN They own the ground it 's built on and said they 'd take it back . MOTHER JONES Spread the word ! We 'll meet at the four corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on box and addresses the audience as if they were the miners . Actors straggle in like those late to a meeting as MOTHER JONES speaks . MOTHER JONES Boys , I know how hard it 's been . This strike has been goin ' on five months now , and you 've stood your ground and shown you 're men . More than seven thousand of your brothers have died in the mines here in the last twenty years , and what have you got to show for it ? There 's no law to protect your life nor limb , and none to protect your job . You know coal company recruiters are in Europe at this very minute living in palace hotels , and drinking 50 year old brandy while they solicit more cheap immigrant labor . Bill Phipps , you 're working fourteen hours a day now and ca n't get ahead . The company owns everything , but this public corner we 're standing on . Where I come from we would n't ask the pigs to live in the shacks the company gives you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for human conditions for human beings . Are you company dogs boys , or are you human beings ? Crowd responds . p. 53 MOTHER JONES Then do n't go back to work , boys . The Negro slave possessed advantages that the white laboring man has not . When the slave was ill his master cured him ; the company makes you dig two tons of coal to pay the company doctor ; when the slave was hungry he was fed ; the company charges you nine tons of coal to eat ; when the slave was naked he was clothed . Nobody is doing this for you . You pity yourselves but do n't pity your brothers , or you would stand together to help one another . You 've got to take the pledge . Rise and pledge to stick to your brothers and the Union till the strike 's won ! Men shuffle their feet and stay seated . Women rise , some with babies in their arms , others with children hanging onto their skirts . WOMEN ( Divide the lines among the actors ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother ! No one from our house is goin ' to work tomorrow , Mother ! The strike is still on ! We 're not slaves , Mother ! My man ai n't goin ' ! I give you my solemn pledge , to see no one goes to work in that mine ! WOMAN Listen to me , neighbors . We kept Mother Jones all night in our house , and you know  --  all of you know what the coal company did . They sent the Sheriff at the crack of dawn to throw this Angel , sent to us by God , out into the road . And then the company directed the Sheriff to evict my family and me from that miserable shack they called our home . In this small wagon is what was in our house ; a picture of the Blessed Virgin , a picture of her son , Jesus , a few pots and dishes , a bedstead , a table and two chairs . Our earthly possessions from working fifteen years for fat masters . Because we were good Samaritans last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company has thrown us out , robbed us of bed and shelter . They 're afraid of a grandmother !  --  and you men are afraid of the company ? We 're on the edge of the world now  --  There 's no more room to be afraid ! Stand up with us and take the pledge . p. 54 MEN ( Again divide the lines ) The bastards ! There 's no way ! I 'm with you , Mother ! We pledge ! I wo n't go back to work till we get what we want ! You 're right , Mother ! We wo n't work ! Help us , Mother , what can we do about the scabs ? We do n't want to go back to work till we win our demands , but , Mother , the company has brought in scabs to take our jobs . We got nothin ' but a roof and black coffee , but the company will take even that.What do we do about the scabs ? MOTHER JONES You men go on home and mind the children . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on now . Do as I ask . I have a sure fire plan to drive the scabs away and to drive the company bosses right up the mountain and back down their own mine shafts . We 'll win this strike and when we do , I 'll buy drinks for every one of you boys . Go home now . The men take the children and start to drift off . MOTHER JONES motions the women to come closer to her . MOTHER JONES I want each and every one of you to meet me back here with mops and brooms . We 're going to sweep the dirty scabs right out of the mine and off the mountain .
