A small empty stage . One six-foot table , some chairs . A light bulb on a stand fades up slowly , its light revealing a poster on a billboard . It displays borders of ice and snow , with an older woman 's sad face at its center . Lettering reads : HARDT PRODUCTIONS IBSEN 'S MASTERPIECE GHOSTS Enter Philip French . He blows on his hands , stamps his feet . He stares at the poster . He takes off his coat and sits , staring bleakly at nothing . He sighs . He sighs again . He sits very still a long time , then sighs once more and sits there , motionless . Enter Willy Hardt , with a big carton containing coffee and rolls . He goes to a switchboard , turns off the bulb on the stand , turns on some stage lights . PHILIP Hi . WILLY AH ! ! ( Pause . ) Jeez , you scared me to death . PHILIP Sorry . WILLY I just did n't see you . PHILIP I 'm Philip French . Street door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm Willy Hardt , Philip . Glad to meet you . ( They shake hands . ) I got some coffee here , and Danish . Want some ? PHILIP Coffee , yeah . ( Willy takes out the coffee and rolls. ) p. 3 WILLY Just sitting in the dark , were you ? PHILIP Thinking . Interesting theatre . WILLY It 's a great building . One of the oldest iron foundries in SoHo . PHILIP Great place for a theatre . WILLY D'Agostino 's . PHILIP What ? WILLY That 's what 's coming in . My lease is up end of the month , unless I 'm in production , then I got it til the end of the show . That 's why I got to get this play on now . I saw your Romeo . Wonderful what you did with Juliet . PHILIP Thanks . WILLY Terrific tragedy . Fun production . You deserved those reviews . PHILIP I was happy with it . WILLY Everybody says you are marvelous with actresses . " Good Woman of Setzuan , " you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " even . No matter what , you get women to do these great things onstage . PHILIP Yeah , well . Yeah . WILLY So , yesterday Romeo , tomorrow Ghosts . Your agent said you were free . Right ? PHILIP That 's why I 'm here . p. 4 WILLY OK . Off-Broadway contract , SSD and C minimum . Open here , and with luck , I want to move it . PHILIP All right . WILLY You get approval on casting , so do I. PHILIP Fine . WILLY And we start now . I mean , today . PHILIP OK . WILLY You know the play ? PHILIP Sure . WILLY Any idea how you 'd want to do it ? PHILIP Straight . WILLY Oh . PHILIP No concept , no gimmicks . No set in North Dakota with costumes made out of ice . A Norway living room , couch , window , fiord outside , and good actors . Straight . WILLY I see what you mean . But , Philip , I tell you , maybe that word 's a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it . How about " as written , " instead . OK ? PHILIP OK . As written . WILLY Ideas about casting ? PHILIP I know three actresses available right now who can do Mrs. Alving . All solid , none sensational , and I 'd like it that way . I do n't want anybody too big . p. 5 WILLY What about Jane Zane ? PHILIP Jane Zane ? WILLY Yeah . What do you think ? PHILIP Well . It 's been awhile since that awful Lady Macbeth . WILLY She needed a director , Philip . PHILIP And a voice . Not much happened to her in California , either , did it ? WILLY She 's back now . PHILIP She is a good actress . Be happy to consider her . WILLY Consider wo n't do . You got ta take her . PHILIP Oh . WILLY One , she 's signed , and two , we 're living together . PHILIP Oh . WILLY I 'll tell you the truth , Philip . Benny Green was going to direct this play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get along . I had to choose between them . It was Jane . PHILIP Why , said Ellery Queen , did n't the star and the director get along ? WILLY Jane has this uh , concept about Mrs. Alving . Benny did n't like it . Tell you the truth , I 'm not nuts about it either , but she 's the right actress , we 're living together , what could I say ? p. 6 PHILIP Bye bye Benny . WILLY Yeah . PHILIP And then you said , " Who 's good handling tough women ? " People said me , and you called my agent . WILLY Well , no , not exactly , but sort of , yeah . So , we still in business ? PHILIP What is this concept of hers ? WILLY I 'll let her tell you that . She 'll be here , eleven fifteen sharp . PHILIP She 's young for the part . WILLY Right , ca n't argue with that . PHILIP With a production concept that sent Benny Green over the hill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How about it , Philip , yes or no ? PHILIP I want to do " Ghosts . " She 'd be good . OK . WILLY Let 's do it ? PHILIP Let 's do it . As long as I can level with her . Be absolutely frank with her . WILLY Absolutely . We got a deal . ( He holds out his hand . They shake again . ) More coffee ? PHILIP No , thanks . WILLY I 'll have some while we wait . She may be a minute or two late . You know . p. 7 PHILIP Yep . ( Philip turns away , immediately sad again . He sits in a chair and stares . Willy watches him . ) WILLY Do you mind if I ask you a personal question ? PHILIP No . WILLY You were just sitting here , in the dark , when I came in . You do that often ? PHILIP Sometimes . WILLY Hamlet . That 's what people call you . PHILIP I know they do . And yes , I cut my wrists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you read about in the papers . WILLY Yeah . Then you jumped out of a hospital window . PHILIP ( Smiling , nodding . ) You saw the photograph . WILLY ( Nodding . ) That awning . PHILIP ( Nodding . ) Saved me . Right . WILLY Problems at Harvard ? PHILIP Well  --  I was a freshman . WILLY Come on . PHILIP I got shrunk , once a day for five years . I function . p. 8 WILLY Choate , Harvard , Austin Riggs , Yale Drama School . And now New York . But you look so sad all the time . Like right now , sitting in that chair . You do look like Hamlet . Or some guy whose best friend ran off with his dog . But you 're hot stuff , and your shows are all happy . They crackle . They pop . Great energy , all that . You 're wonderful with women , and everybody wonders what you 're all about , Philip . PHILIP That 's the way it is . WILLY You 're not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mob or dope or bad S&amp;M or anything like that ? PHILIP Nothing like that . I 'll do my job . WILLY OK , that 's enough for me . Get along with Jane , look like Hamlet , look like Lear . ( He starts out . ) I 'm gon na check the stage door , and wait for her . ( He comes back . ) You decide about that poster . I just had somebody throw it together . ( Starts out , comes back . ) And oh yeah , when you 're talking with Jane , say " as written " instead of " straight , " OK ? ( Exit Willy . Philip gets up , looks again at the poster . He sighs , sad again . He puts his hands to his head and utters a single sob . He sits , and stares at nothing Pause . Enter Willy with Jane Zane , who is a beautiful and talented actress in her late thirties . She carries a huge tape recorder . ) Here she is . Just walked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip , Jane Zane. p. 9 PHILIP Hello , Jane . JANE Philip French ! I did n't see your superb Romeo and Juliet , but I heard about it . You are a very talented young man . ( They shake and hold hands . ) PHILIP Your Lady Macbeth was wonderful . JANE Thank you . WILLY Yeah , well , I thought we 'd just , you know , kind of sort of meet , you know , and talk things over , sort of , easy easy , right ? JANE Is that coffee , Willy ? WILLY And a big cheese and cherry Danish , just for you . JANE How nice . ( She puts her tape recorder down , sweeps off her coat , and smiles at Philip . ) Shall we put our cards on the table , Philip ? PHILIP Sure . JANE Benny Green was going to direct this play . PHILIP That 's what I heard . JANE We had a problem . I made a simple , constructive suggestion . Benny hated it . Did Willy tell you what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from you . WILLY Coffee , Janie , and a danish . p. 10 JANE Thank you , darling . ( To Philip . ) I hope you have an open mind . PHILIP Shoot . JANE Ibsen 's Ghosts . Mrs. Alving . I know I 'm young for the part . To play a mother with a grown son , I mean . PHILIP Willing to dye your hair ? Makeup ? Age ? JANE She can be forty-five , married at eighteen . I can do that . PHILIP OK . JANE Mrs. Alving , then . Innocent , proper woman . She married a man who gave her syphilis . He died . She watched her only son , Oswald , grow up , knowing he could inherit the disease . Now she realizes all this happened because she was too bourgeois to leave a dissolute husband . She was bound , you see , Philip , by convention . PHILIP Yes , I see that . JANE But how do we pull that off today ? Benny Green did n't want anything new . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to do it straight , " he says . " Straight ? " I say . " Straight ? We ca n't do it straight , syphilis is curable now , Benny , for God 's sake , never mind the Women 's Movement , all that . Something NEW , Benny , has got to emerge from this play , and I know what it is ! " I tell him , and he says , " Over my dead body , " and that was what happened to Benny Green . p. 11 PHILIP Jane . What ? JANE This . ( She holds up a cassette , pops it into the tape machine . ) Ibsen 's Ghosts ends with Mrs. Alving facing a dreadful choice . Her son Oswald had syphilis . Afraid he will go mad , become a vegetable , he gives his mother a vial of deadly poison , for HER to give to HIM , when his brain goes and he falls apart . " That day will never come ! " says Mrs. Alving , and they settle down . Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Until Oswald says to her , " Mother , give me the sun . " The sun he wants , just like that , and she knows he 's crazy , it 's syphilis , paresis , he 's gone . What is she going to do ? She looks at the deadly poison , in the little vial . She looks at Oswald , her son . Back and forth . Back and forth . Curtain ! ( Pause . ) Right ? PHILIP That 's what Ibsen indicates , yes . JANE Same old thing ! But suppose we do n't DO the same old thing ! Suppose she makes Oswald 's life as a paralytic syphylitic blah-blah-blah- NOT worse than death ! Instead of all that , Jesus , Scandanavian depression , Mrs. Alving not only does NOT give Oswald poison , she does NOT leave him jelly , asking for the sun . No , she will try , try something ! Even if doomed , she is a mother ! PHILIP All right , try what ? p. 12 JANE To SAVE HIS LIFE ! PHILIP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her tape recorder . A contralto begins " My Heart At Thy Sweet Voice , " from Saint-Saens opera Sampson and Delilah . ) DELILAH ( Singing . ) Mon coeur s'ouvre a ta voix commes'ouvre les fleurs  --  Auxbaisers de l'aurore ! JANE We hear THIS heavenly music ! We see divine light ! Mrs. Alving , the modern modern woman , throws away the deadly poison ! Her mother 's instinct erupts ! DELILAH ( Singing . ) Mais , o bien-aime , pour mieux sechermes pleurs , Que ta voix parle encore ! JANE She tears open her blouse , exposing her breast ! Oswald ! He sees it . Mother ! DELILAH ( Singing . ) Dis-moi qu'a Dalila tu reviens pourjamais ! JANE Dimly , he stares at her . He moves toward her ! She toward him ! He holds out his arms ! DELILAH ( Singing . ) Redis a ma tendress  --  p. 13 JANE Son ! Mother ! Curtain ! DELILAH ( Singing . ) Redis a ma tendress  --  JANE There . Tragedy , and grace . Dignity in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  JANE Passion in her victory ! DELILAH ( Singing . ) Ces serments que j'amais ! JANE Today ! ( Philip and Willy look at each other . Philip punches off the tape recorder . ) PHILIP Jane , Oswald wants light , not milk . ( Deadly pause . ) JANE Is that important ? PHILIP Yes . JANE That kind of logic appeals to you ? PHILIP Yes . JANE You do n't like my idea ? PHILIP It 's dumb . JANE What ? WILLY Now , Janie  --  JANE WHAT did you say ? p. 14 PHILIP Dumb , I said . It 's anti-female . JANE ANTI-FEMALE ? PHILIP That means against women , right . JANE ME ? AGAINST WOMEN ? ? ? PHILIP You . WILLY Now , Philip , wait a minute . JANE I 'll kill him ! WILLY Janie , have some coffee . The danish . JANE I 'll break his neck ! WILLY Janie , now listen . Philip let you talk . Now you let him talk . You eat , you drink . Philip , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coffee . ) SO TALK ! PHILIP One . Baring your breast onstage . Colette did it at the end of the 19th century . Zoe Caldwell did it in 1970 playing Colette . It just ai n't modern . Two . Oswald has syphilis , not rickets , milk is n't going to help him . Three . Your divine music is Delilah singing " My Heart At Thy Sweet Voice " to Sampson in French , just before she cuts off his hair and his balls , while we are in Norway , speaking English , and that is all just too confusing . Four . You will look like you are playing Mrs. Alving to show off your boobs , which will be anti-female , any which way anybody can look at it , and five , Henrik Ibsen wrote Ghosts , not Jane Zane. p. 15 WILLY Philip , please ! JANE &amp; PHILIP Shut up ! JANE You blockhead . You pompous child . You ca n't talk to me like that . Mr. Hamlet Social Register , went to Harvard and cut his wrists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weird , weird , weird , does n't have girls , does n't have boys , and Who the Hell Cares ! WE are NOT going to get along ! Willy , get somebody else ! WILLY Now , Janie  --  JANE WILLY ! WILLY I do n't think I CAN get anybody else , not now ! So Philip was a little harsh about women , Janie . I got a show to get produced here , and Janie , honey , if you want to be in it , you two GET ALONG ! ( Pause . ) JANE You do n't like my idea either . WILLY Well  --  JANE Say it . WILLY A grown man 's mother would n't do that , Janie . JANE Both of you hate my contribution to death . Right ? WILLY &amp; PHILIP A grown man 's mother just would n't do that . WILLY Janie . ( Pause . Jane nods . She stares at the wall . She shifts her weight , stares at the floor . She looks out into the house , staring , thinking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . WILLY What ? JANE In the house . ( All three peer into the darkness . ) PHILIP I see him . WILLY Where ? PHILIP In the back . There . WILLY Bums . They get in the stage door and sleep here . ( Willy goes to the apron . ) Hey ! You ! We see you ! ( No answer . ) Who are you ? ( No answer . ) Nobody 's allowed in the theatre . You ca n't stay here . ( A figure moves into one aisle . ) That 's right , pal . Come on . We 'll show you out . ( The figure hesitates . ) Come on . Buddy . You got to go now . JANE It 's not a man . It 's a woman . ( The figure comes to the edge of the stage . ) ESTHER Hello , Philip . PHILIP Hello , Mother . ( Esther French is a well-dressed , plainfaced woman . She carries a large piece of coarse paper , rolled up . ) WILLY His mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I called this morning , but you were gone . Your agent said you 'd be here . p. 17 PHILIP It 's all right , Mother . ( He helps Ester onto the stage . ) Willy Hardt , Jane Zane . My mother , Esther French . WILLY Hi . JANE Hi . ESTHER Good morning . I really must speak to my son . It 's very important . WILLY Right now ? JANE His mother ? Really ? ( Esther points to a chair . ) ESTHER Philip , please . ( Philip sits , obediently . He and his mother face each other , while above them , Willy and Jane watch them . Esther takes from her purse a computer print-out sheet . ) I have sold everything . The house on East 68th Street . The estate in Ammagansett . The Rock Garden Museum . All the bonds . Everything your stepfather left me . This is what I got for them . ( She hands the sheet to Willy . ) He wo n't believe me . Would you be a witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) WILLY God . ESTHER That is an appropriate response . WILLY That 's a lot of money . Here , Philip . PHILIP No . I believe her . ( Esther takes it back. ) p. 18 ESTHER Do you know what it means ? It means money is silly now . What was on paper , I could worry about , but not what 's cold cash in banks . I can do anything I want . Fly to the moon . Interrupt a rehearsal . Do anything , and go anywhere . PHILIP That 's fine , Mother . ESTHER But where do I want to go , Philip ? PHILIP I do n't know , Mother . ESTHER Philip , I want to go - to Hawaii . PHILIP Good , Mother . You 'll enjoy it . ESTHER A cold winter in Hawaii , son ! PHILIP I heard you , Mother . ESTHER No , you did n't . ( To Willy and Jane . ) He does n't even remember . JANE Well , Hawaii 's nice , Mrs. French . WILLY Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? WILLY I think . With that kind of money , you can get to Hawaii somehow . ESTHER So why do n't I just go ? Of course . What 's the problem ? Old lady out to lunch , lost all her marbles . PHILIP Mother , I 'll take you home . p. 19 ESTHER I 've sold my home , my darling . I walked out of it with one suitcase . I 'm at the Sherry Netherland now , for a week only . And where are you , my boy ? In that sterile condominium I bought you , living like a monk ? No girls , no boys , no one . Only your razor blades , to kill yourself with . ( To Willy and Jane . ) Twice , you know . Wrists once , ankles once . His throat will be next . Or another open window . ( Philip gets up . ) PHILIP Mother , this is too painful . We must go . ESTHER Sit down , please . ( Philip does . ) When you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet remarried , and we had to live together in that attic in Detroit , I strung a wire across it , and hung curtains there , for your privacy and mine . Over your bed , below a photograph of me in my wedding dress , you pasted picture after picture of the Hawaiian Islands . Sunsets and waterfalls , flowers and beaches , with my face smiling above them . PHILIP Mother , I was nine years old . ESTHER And you knew what you wanted . Do you know that much now ? Do you remember this ? ( Esther unrolls the coarse paper . It is a home-made poster . It says HAWAII . On it is pasted a childish collage of a Hawaiian sunset , the sea , palm trees and flowers , with the face of a Hawaiian woman smiling about it . ) You made this when you were nine . I kept it . Philip , look at it ! ( She holds it out , clumsily . Jane takes it from her. ) p. 20 JANE Let me help you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She and Willy lay it smoothly over the Ghosts poster , and stick it there with pushpins . Esther sits at the opposite end of the table from Philip . Jane and Willy stand between them . ) ESTHER Whose face was that , Philip , really , above the island you dreamed about at night ? It was mine . You know it was mine . ( Jane looks at Willy and smiles a wicked smile . ) You knew who you were when you made that poster . You do n't now . You 're lost . I waited in the dark , listening to you haggle over some old play no one cares about anymore . You are lost , in the theatre , this oh really , tawdry land of illusion and dirt , where second rate substitutes masquerade for everything that 's real . Why pretend ? What you want from life is me , and what I want is you ! Let me give you what you really want ! JANE ( To Willy . ) Grown man 's mother would n't do that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ESTHER When your father died and we lived together , we knew . Everything since has been chaos . Your step-father 's money , our separations and quarrels , my agonies , your razor blades , dear God in heaven , you never got over what 's on that poster ; neither did I ! We 've tried to live apart and look ! Come back to me , Philip , now ! ( Jane looks at Willy , points to Esther , and punches on the tape . Music : the climax of " My Heart At Thy Sweet Voice " plays. ) p. 21 DELILAH ( Sings . ) Ah ! Reponds , reponds a ma tendresse ! Verse-moi , verse-moi l'ivresse ! ESTHER Oahu , Maui , Kaui , Molokai , all the Hawaiian Islands and your picture of me , together , up and down the wall of your childhood you pasted them , your mother in that Pacific paradise , my face and my body against sea and sun and foam ! ( Willy and Jane stare at them , aghast . ) DELILAH ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ma tendresse ! Verse-moi , verse-moi I'ivresse ! ESTHER I 'm yours , my boy . Take the only thing you will ever in all your life really want ! I am waiting for you , in a paradise of wind , sea , flowers , and your mother in the sun ! I can give you the sun ! ! ! ( The music on the tape runs out . Silence . ) JANE Oh , dear , too much . I 'm sorry , Philip . PHILIP It 's all right . ( Philip speaks to his mother slowly but very firmly . ) It is n't , Mother , that I do n't still dream of those islands , rising out of the sea . I do . But the Hawaiian Islands have changed . On Oahu now , you ca n't find Diamond Head for the hotels and condos . Maui is choked with MacDonalds , Beautiful natives are tour guide clowns . And you are old and I am sad . My childhood ? Millions ca n't buy it back , even if we dream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse . p. 22 ESTHER But why ? PHILIP To live . ESTHER With razor blades and windows ? PHILIP I 'll survive ! In this tawdry land of illusion and dirt . In the theatre , Mother , where you live within me , as Mrs. Alving , as Lady Macbeth , and as Juliet . ( Philip gently detaches himself from Esther . ) Keep the money , go to Hawaii . ESTHER Alone ? PHILIP Take your bankbook . You 'll meet somebody . ( They stare at each other , facing the inevitable . ) ESTHER When will I come back to you ? PHILIP We both know the answer to that . ESTHER Never ? PHILIP Never . ESTHER But will you live ? PHILIP I will . ESTHER Throw away the razor blades ? PHILIP Yes . ESTHER Promise ? PHILIP I promise . ESTHER Use something electric ? PHILIP All right . p. 23 ESTHER Stay away from open windows ? PHILIP Always . ESTHER Do we say goodbye  --  now ? PHILIP As good a time as any . ESTHER I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in paradise . ( Pause . ) ESTHER ( To Willy and Jane . ) I am sorry I disturbed your rehearsal . ( She goes to the door . ) Goodbye , son . PHILIP Goodbye , Mother . ( Exit Esther . ) JANE Are you all right ? PHILIP I think so . WILLY She forgot the poster . JANE I 'll take it to her ! PHILIP No . ( Philip looks at his poster of Hawaii and the smiling face of the Hawaiian woman . Philip goes to the poster . He takes it down quickly , revealing behind it the bitter face of Mrs. Alving . ) PHILIP About Mrs. Alving . JANE Whatever you say . PHILIP No , let 's talk . p. 24 JANE Lunch ? PHILIP Fine . WILLY OK ! ( Philip drops the poster into a waste can , and exits with Jane . Willy follows , turning off the stage lights and the light bulb on the stand back on . It illuminates , as before , harshly , the poster for Ghosts : ice , snow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly. )
