The Israelis have tried tear gas , rubber bullets and real ones , mass arrests , imprisonment and deportations . All of those strategies have failed to stop the wave of unrest that has engulfed Israel 's occupied territories during the past seven weeks . So last week Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin shifted tactics one more time . From now on , he said , his soldiers would not fire on stone-tossing protesters  --  they would beat them up . <P> In a speech before Labor Party officials in the Knesset , Rabin defended the policy by pointing out that " no demonstrators have died from being thwacked on the head . " Israeli troops armed with wooden truncheons were dispatched to potential trouble spots in the Gaza Strip and West Bank . By week 's end United Nations relief officials reported that soldiers had used clubs and fists to beat hundreds of Palestinians , including some women who were caught violating the around-the-clock curfew that has confined tens of thousands to their homes . At least ten of those beaten required hospitalization . Government leaders conceded that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the world . Said a senior official : " Our image has been bad , and I 'm afraid it will remain so with this new policy . " <P> The curfew , which affected refugee camps in Gaza and the West Bank , was extended Friday evening to a neighborhood in Arab East Jerusaleum , the first time such a measure had been used there since Israel seized the sector in 1967 . The restriction imposed an uneasy tranquillity in the territories , but even Rabin called it a " forced calm " likely to be shattered as soon as the Arab population was allowed back on the streets . Some curfew restrictions were lifted after complaints of food shortages . Israeli officials insisted that any shortages were self-imposed , the result of a commercial strike that has shuttered most Arab shops in Gaza , East Jerusalem and the West Bank for more than two weeks . <P> According to Israeli security sources , an underground Palestinian steering committee has now been set up to organize and encourage future disturbances . It is made up of six to eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest with ties to the Palestine Liberation Organization . The P.L.O. , initially caught off guard by the spontaneous uprisings , said its main arm , Fatah , was responsible for an attempted raid into northern Israel by three Palestinians . The trio entered the country by cutting a large hole in the security fence along the Lebanese border and apparently intended to attack a nearby kibbutz . The raiders were hunted down by an Israeli border patrol and killed in a firefight . <P> The assault gave Israeli officials one more reason to reject the possibility of pursuing peace talks with the P.L.O . ' s Yasser Arafat . But beyond the policy of beatings , Israeli officials offered no new ideas for dealing with Palestinian unrest . Shimon Peres , the Labor Party leader and Foreign Minister in the national unity government , suggested that the elections scheduled for November be moved up in hopes of producing a government better able to deal with the crisis . Predictably , Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir , head of the right-wing Likud bloc , rejected the idea , saying it " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
