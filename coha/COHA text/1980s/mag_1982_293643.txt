Reagan offers aid and arms to struggling Southern neighbors <P> On one level , it was a generous and good-neighborly offer to promote prosperity among the almost two dozen diverse countries of the Caribbean Basin . On a more strategic plane , it was designed as a political instrument to deter domestic turmoil in a region ripe for left-wing revolutions . And on its most basic level , Ronald Reagan 's Caribbean Basin Initiative , announced amid much fanfare to the Organization of American States last week , is the logical outgrowth of an agonizing yearlong struggle to support the beleaguered current government of El Salvador and draw the line against further expansion of Soviet and Cuban influence . There was a grim urgency in the President 's plea : " If we do not act promptly and decisively in defense of freedom , new Cubas will arise from the ruins of today 's conflicts .

His speech did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marxist-Leninist dictatorships , " but it did not stress the projection of military might .

Mindful that it will be years before the impact is felt , Reagan asked for $350 million in additional direct economic aid to the region this year . Explained Trade Representative William Brock : " We need one hard shot now because a lot of these countries are simply out of cash . " El Salvador will get about $100 million more , as will economically ailing Costa Rica . The rest will be split among Jamaica , Honduras and the Dominican Republic . The package will raise economic aid to the region to $824 million , up 96% from last year . <P> Some of Reagan 's aides wanted him to focus his speech solely on the economic development plan , talking of plowshares rather than swords . Their aim was to tone down his hawkish image , especially concerning Cuba and Nicaragua , and to keep him personally insulated from the trying situation in El Salvador . Secretary of State Alexander Haig , however , argued that the President must include firm warnings about Communist expansion .
