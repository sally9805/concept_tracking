The U.S. dollar held steady for the second consecutive session yesterday as Tuesday ' s intervention by European central banks continued to exert a stabilizing influence on currency markets . " I don ' t think the market is through selling dollars , but that round of intervention has given it a temporary base , " said Christiane Mandell , an economist at Barclays Bank International , New York . The new base for the dollar lies at about 1. 9850 West German marks , traders and analysts said . That was the dollar ' s level against the bellwether European currency when several European central banks , led by West Germany ' s Bundesbank , bought an estimated $500 million to $800 million to support the U.S. unit on Tuesday . Since then , the dollar hasn ' t strayed from a tight range between 1. 9932 and 2. 0070 marks . " The central banks have virtually created a Bretton Woods for themselves , " said John W. Baker , chief trader at Bank Julius Baer &; Co . , New York , referring to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baker said fear of renewed intervention has speculators too frightened to sell dollars much below 2. 00 marks .

But it ' s only a matter of time before the dollar sinks to new lows , traders predicted .

Sapiro , vice president and chief dealer at Continental Illinois National Bank &; Trust Co . , Chicago . He added that without cooperation from the Federal Reserve , the European central banks can ' t hold the dollar indefinitely at current levels . " And on our side of the water , we know the Fed isn ' t going to help support the dollar , " Mr. Sapiro said .
