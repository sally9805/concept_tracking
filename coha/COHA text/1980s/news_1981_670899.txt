The program , called " New Careers for Women , " is not directly affiliated with a university , although Yale has provided space for the administrative offices and classrooms . Nor will the course offer Mrs. Bonthron an accredited degree or a guarantee of a job. // Yet she is paying $1 , 800 for the program , now in its fifth year , because she believes it will lead to a well-paying position with a good future. // In addition to extensive career counseling and training in business skills , the program includes a five-month managerial internship - without pay - with a local business or service agency , which provides the student a job reference based on ability shown . And Mrs. Bonthron believes this is more crucial than another academic degree. // // References and Experience // She already has a bachelor of science degree from Cornell University . " I know too many women of my age with advanced degrees who can ' t find work because they don ' t have the experience or the reference employers are looking for , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a 31-year-old mother with a bachelor ' s degree in English , who has been out of the job market since 1974 , is taking a similar course . This one , called " Management Development for Women , " is run by Fairfield University . Mrs. Niemiec is paying $750 for the nine-month course of business studies . Neither does this program offer a guarantee of a managerial job nor does it give an accredited diploma. // Similar programs exist throughout the country . Some , like the one at Fairfield University , are affiliated with a college and initiated with a seed grant from the Federal Government . Others , such as the course in New Haven formed by a group of Yale faculty wives , are independent of the academic or formal business community. // In New York , such courses range from the 10-week workshop offered at $180 by Janice LaRouche Associates , a private career counseling organization , to the eight-month , $650 career internship program offered at the Columbia University School of General Studies. // According to Catalyst , a national organization working to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of women have taken such courses in the last 10 years. // However , since these are nontraditional courses , there is a certain uneasiness about them among members of some women ' s organizations. // " I can see spending three weeks or a month on something like that , " said Felice Schwartz , president of Catalyst . " But after a whole year you should have a credential or something to show for your time and money. " // Dr. Bernice Sandler , who is directing the Project on the Status and Education of Women at the Washington office of the Association of American Colleges , believes that more information about these courses should be made available . " We need to develop regional or local guides that tell a woman exactly what choices she has , so she knows what she is getting and can compare. " // Mrs. Schwartz said that without accreditation , " there is no measure of whether the program will be well put together or taken seriously in the marketplace . " She also said she believed that the generally highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curriculum because of students ' varying backgrounds . At the National Commission on Working Women - where these sort of programs are known as " job cooperatives " - the idea is considered superlative in concept but members have reservations about quality control of the programs. // The directors of the two Connecticut programs concede that there is room for wide variation in quality among such courses for women . However , they see themselves as charting new patterns that will bring together the academic community with the business world to assist college-educated women without marketable skills . They believe that innovation is just what is needed right now . They also defend these programs as being for a special sort of woman , one who has neither a clear idea of exactly what she wants to do nor the money or time to spend on a specialized advanced degree. // " The woman who definitely knows she wants a law degree or an M.B.A. is not going to need us , " said Judith Baldwin , director of New Careers for Women . " But there is a real need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who doesn ' t have the luxury of starting graduate school. " // Successful placement at New Careers is running at about 90 percent , according to Gabriel Cash , a former administrator of the New Haven program . At Fairfield University , which started its program only last year , the current figures are 14 placements out of a graduating class last June of 27 . Jobs for graduates have included market research analyst for a national marketing consulting concern , director of alumni affairs at a college , department manager at a bank and director of fund raising at a private school. // At Columbia , where the program is in its second year , an official said 19 of the 20 graduates had found jobs . Vilma Allen , director of special programs at Fairfield University , said that care should be taken to insure that the program is not simply being used as a way to fill empty spaces at colleges hard pressed for students and cash. // She said the Fairfield program had been set up with an advisory board of representatives of major corporations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kinds of skills they felt would be most appropriate for the mature woman with life experiences and at least a bachelor ' s degree . " <> <> Need for Employer Contacts // Sandra Porter , senior associate at the Commission on Working Women , said that a good program should include an administration that was in constant touch with employers and employment possibilities in the area as well as instruction that was sympathetic to the special dilemmas of the midlife woman and was gender-free in its approach to employing women in higher managerial positions. // Jean Clarkson , director of Catalyst ' s national research network that screens many re-entry programs , said that many women might rush into a course without first deciding what it was they really wanted to do , " so the guidance component is absolutely essential. " // Two employers who have worked with the Fairfield University program , the Perkin-Elmer Corporation in Norwalk and the People ' s Savings Bank in Bridgeport , suggested that the status of the college was crucial . A course taken at a high-ranking college can carry more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns said. // IT DIDN ' T WORK FOR ONE. . . // " Maybe it was a lack in the course or a lack in myself but I felt I needed credentials , " said Barbara Granger , 54 years old , who lives in New Haven . Now divorced , Mrs. Granger ' s marriage to a Yale professor was floundering at the time she decided in 1976 to look into the " New Careers for Women " program in New Haven. // " I wanted to get a sense of myself after having spent 28 years as a full-time wife . " However , upon completion of the course in 1978 , she said , she found that the only jobs she was offered were " lowpaying sorts of entry positions. " // Having obtained an undergraduate degree in sociology before her marriage , she found she was eligible to enroll in the two-year master ' s degree program at the Yale School of Public Health . That fit her interests and resulted in her obtaining credentials to become the director of the advocacy project for the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York that helps communities set up home-care services. // Without returning to school and obtaining more traditional education , Mrs. Granger said , she would not have been considered for the job. // . . . BUT ANOTHER MADE A HAPPY TRANSITION // " I had always been attracted to the business world , " explained Rita Kotch , 38 years old . Mrs. Kotch , who is married to a physician and who lives in Redding , Conn. , was a teacher before marriage and the raising of her three children , who are now teen-agers . She felt , however , that continuing in teaching would not have offered her the opportunities for advancement and challenge she sought. // She enrolled in the " Management Development for Women " work reentry course of Fairfield University in the fall of 1979 instead of obtaining another degree , " because it seemed to offer me immediate tools to go out into the work place and I was afraid to devote too many more years to schooling at my age .
