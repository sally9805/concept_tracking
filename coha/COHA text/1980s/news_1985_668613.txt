And now a question to test your knowledge of regional demographics , music marketing and the interactions between religion and rock ' n ' roll : In which parts of the country is a Christian rock band  --  a band that plays rock ' n ' roll with religious content  --  likely to receive a favorable reception : ( a ) the Chicago area , ( b ) the Northeast , ( c ) California , ( d ) the Bible Belt . If you picked any of the first three categories , you ' re correct , at least in the case of DeGarmo &; Key , a Christian group fronted by Ed DeGarmo and Dana Key that plays medium-hard rock and has done well in each of those areas . The region around Chicago , in fact , has been " very good , if not our best area , " according to Key , and the band will be making another foray into friendly territory Thursday when it appears at the Holiday Star Theater in Merrillville , Ind. , on a bill with Farrell &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belt  --  is another matter . " We sell lots of records in the Chicago area and the Midwest , " says Key . " We do good in the Northeast . We do wonderful in California . And we do absolutely terrible in the South . " The slowest area for us , and it ' s just starting to turn around , has traditionally been the Bible Belt . You might think that the Bible Belt would be our best area , but they ' re a little conservative there , and we ' re a little more radical than they really want . " But that ' s changing . We just played in Dallas , Houston and Birmingham ; we have a concert scheduled in Baton Rouge ; and we played several times in our home state of Tennessee this year , which is unusual for us . " It ' s really a change . A few years ago , we played very few concert dates in the South , " says Key , who lives in Memphis . " As far as record sales , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to sell records in the conservative South . But the concerts and the record sales have all turned around in the last couple of years . " I think one thing we ' re starting to see in the South is Christian radio that plays rock music . Record sales seem to follow the amount of airplay on Christian radio . There are some stations in the Chicago area that play our music and have for a long time , and that ' s one reason our concerts are successful there and our records sell well there . If you don ' t have radio , no one knows you exist . " Another explanation for the band ' s changing fortunes in the Bible Belt , says Key , might be that the hierarchies of the churches are changing . Younger people who have grown up with rock ' n ' roll are taking the place of older , more fundamentalist church officials , Key says . " There was a big Jesus movement in the late ' 60s and early ' 70s that consisted of radical kids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that particular time period . That ' s when we gave our lives to Christ and started playing Christian rock . Well , those people from the Jesus movement are old enough now that they ' re in positions of authority in churches . They are youth pastors and youth directors and choir leaders and in some cases even pastors . They ' re in their 30s now , and I think that ' s making a difference for us . " There are a lot more contemporary records being sold today than any other form of gospel . When we first got into this , back in the early ' 70s , the only records that really sold were James Cleveland albums , the Blackwood Brothers and Southern gospel . But the Christian groups playing contemporary or rock now outsell them 10 to 1 , and that ' s all happened in the last five years . " Another new development in Christian music  --  as well as secular music  --  is music video , and Key thinks this additional marketing tool has helped the band . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Our latest album is ' Communication , ' and we did a video for a song on that album called ' 666 . ' In the last few months , ' 666 ' has become our biggest song in concert  --  people cheer when we say we ' re going to play it  --  and since we haven ' t released a single of it , the only way they recognize it is they ' ve seen the video on television . " Another way videos are helping us is that Christian bookstores , which are the largest sellers of our records , use the videos in-store . They play them all day long . We ' re trying to get ' 666 ' played on MTV and secular video shows . MTV has told us they intend to play it , though they haven ' t started . " Key notes that 15-to-18-year-olds , who were not much in evidence before at DeGarmo &; Key concerts , have begun turning up at venues around the country . Although Key isn ' t sure exactly why that age group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied somehow to a change of mood in the country . " There ' s definitely a conservative revival in America , " says Key . " That ' s certainly not hurting our ministry or our music . In fact , it ' s made things easier . We ' re not viewed in the same way we were 5 or 10 years ago . We ' re more reflective of the mood of the country now . " The thing we heard over and over was that Christian rock would be gone in five years . That ' s exactly the thing they said about secular rock ' n ' roll in its early days . But it ' s obvious Christian rock is going to be here for a long time . " When we first started out , we had to play for free . Many times we had to just set up a flat-bed trailer in a parking lot and play real loud to attract an audience . Now we ' re booked up a year in advance . " If there are parallels between Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We get very little secular radio attention or secular press attention , " says Key . " I think , for one thing , people are afraid . There are a lot of religious zealots in the world who are willing to load up their cars with TNT and crash into embassies . And like it or not , if we play rock music and we talk about God , we ' re considered fanatics . In some people ' s minds , we ' re placed with the fanatics who do weird things around the world . " Usually you can get a commitment from a radio station to play your music until they realize that you ' re basically a gospel act . When they figure that out , they begin to back-pedal . What the elements are of their fear , I don ' t know . " Maybe they ' re afraid they ' ll be accused of supporting this particular religion over another . I really don ' t know what it is , but we encounter that kind of thing very regularly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a concert hall even with that kind of attitude . In the last two years , record sales have been incredible for us . We had just assumed that a Christian rock album could sell maybe 50 , 000 units at the most . But in the last two years , we ' ve sold 150 , 000 units a year . We sit around hour after hour and discuss why that might be , but your guess is as good as mine or Ed ' s . We don ' t really know . " While the acceptance is certainly welcome , it has to be viewed in the right light , says Key . " We used to go around feeling like persecuted prophets in the old days , " he says , " because we couldn ' t find anyplace to play and it was hard to sell records . Now people treat us like celebrities , and that brings a whole new set of problems . The challenge now is to remember why we got into this , why we ' re doing what we ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being persecuted to remember we were doing this for Jesus , and this is our lot in life , and we have our cross to bear . Now it ' s very easy to sign autographs and forget why you came . " We try to take time out every day to pray and have Bible study . We have a lot of mature Christians within our band , and we remind ourselves why we ' re here . Occasionally , one of us will get the big head , but there are always guys around to remind him of who we are . " But , yes , there ' s a purity that comes with struggling that goes away when success starts to flow .
