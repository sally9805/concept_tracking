 | It was a Friday night in South Central I Los Angeles . Bernard Stevenson , 22 , stood at his customary spot in front of a liquor store selling dime bags of crack . Stevenson was taking more of a risk than usual for a man in his business : the store had already been the scene of three " drive-by " shootings that week , and Stevenson was wearing some blue in a neighborhood controlled by the Bloods , whose color is red . But Stevenson did n't care about the danger . " S -- - , if one gang do n't get me , another will , " he said . An hour later a gun barrel blazed from the window of a passing car and Stevenson was dead . Fifteen minutes from the manicured lawns of Beverly Hills , in the gangland slums of South Central L.A. , kids as young as 15 years old roam the streets in customized BMW 's and Mercedeses . Some tote Uzi submachine guns and Sovietmade AK-47 assault rifles . The fancy cars are for show . The guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gangrelated violent crimes in the city and county of Los Angeles , including 328 homicides . The authorities blame most of the trouble on black youth gangs that make millions of dollars a year selling crack . Black gangs have been a part of the L.A. landscape since the ' 50s . Back then their activities were largely confined to petty crimes and small-scale marijuana and PCP dealing . But the arrival of the cocaine derivative crack five years ago has created a billiondollar underground economy , changing both the neighborhood and the gangs who work it . " Los Angeles is now the clearing point , the center of a distribution network for the entire western United States , " says Sgt. Bob Sobel of the Los Angeles Sheriff 's Department . " And it all goes through South Central . " The volume of coke is so great that gang members who once were the musclemen for big dealers are now dealing themselves . The numbers are staggering . Police say there are about 74 gangs affiliated with the Bloods , totaling about 5,000 members . The rival Crips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almost all of the gangs are involved in the crack trade . " A typical gang might have 200 kids from 13 to 26 years of age , " says Steven Strong , the Los Angeles Police Department 's detective in charge of gang intelligence . " Each gang moves anywhere between 25 and 40 kilos of coke per month . " Dress codes : The quantity of cocaine passing through Los Angeles has set off an old-fashioned price war . The wholesale price of a kilo of unprocessed coke has dropped from the $65,000-to-$80,000 range three years ago to $16,000 today . Competition between the Crips and Bloods subgangs is intense , and the streets of South Central have taken on the appearance of a battlefield complete with " soldiers " in " uniform . " The gangs have their own dress codes , colors and even languages . Those affiliated with the Crips wear blue sneakers , blue laces , blue windbreakers . The Bloods prefer red . But the rival groups have plenty in common : members of both pick up their cocaine from big dealers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car-detailing shops ; and both run " cook houses " that turn the cocaine into crack . The Crips and the Bloods used to fight over turf " West Side Story " style , with switchblades and chains . Now they battle for market share with handguns ; the big-time dealers who supply the gangs favor those Uzis and AK-47s . The animosity between the two gangs runs so deep that the Bloods eliminate the letter " c " from their graffiti , replacing it with " k . " The Crips go even further , disdaining the letter " b " even in speech , as in " I 'll c back " for " I 'll be back . " But the violence is not restricted to the Crips versus the Bloods . Two weeks ago 30-year-old postal worker David Thompson and his wife , Namora , stopped at a gas station in South Central on their way home from a latenight church meeting . Three armed teenagers rushed the couple , robbed them and then casually shot Thompson in the head . The gang members pushed the dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drove away . In South Central , the crack  | hustle starts young . Police report that kids as young as nine years old stand on corners selling nickel and dime bags ; they can make up to $400 a day . " Delivery boys " carry beepers connecting them to dealers ; there are so many of them that many schools in the area have banned the telephone pagers . " The kids were getting beeped in class to go deliver dope , " says LASD Sgt. Wes McBride . Youngsters model themselves on people like " Five Fingers " Charlie , who at 15 is already a veteran of the crackgang wars . Charlie joined one of the Blood gangs when he was 11 : " I saw the older guys drivin ' aroun ' in those nice cars and I thought I could get some , too , " he says . By 14 Charlie owned three cars ; he was pulling in $300,000 a year selling crack . He had also been busted and spent 14 months in a correctional facility . Now Charlie 's back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and easy money hard to resist . " I want to be a lawyer some day , " he says . " But once you have been with a gang , it 's hard to get out . " The size , violence and financial resources of the crack gangs have stymied police efforts to stop them from taking over South Central . " We 're seeing 15- to 20-the West Coast , " says Strong . " It may not be as sophisticated as the Italian Mafia , but it 's organized . " year-old millionaires from rock cocaine , " says Sobel . " They 've got electronic policedetection systems , sophisticated weapons ? better equipment than we have . " The crack gangs are not limiting their operations to Los Angeles . " All it takes is two guys to move out to another city and recruit the locals , " says McBride . " Then the cocaine link to L.A. is made . " Police in Denver , Phoenix , Las Vegas , San Diego and Portland have already reported L.A. gang members in their cities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so good that some law-enforcement officials are switching sides . " It 's no secret ? there are a lot of cops on the gang payroll , " says a wellplaced officer in the LAPD . " We 've fired lots of them for tipping dealers off before a raid , for using coke , for actually selling it themselves . " Regular patrol units in South Central have been known to shake down street dealers , seizing their money and dope and driving off . A more sinister tactic is to pick up a gang troublemaker and drop him off in the rival gang 's turf ? a stunt that under some circumstances is tantamount to murder . For the cops who remain straight , the new gang godfathers are growing more brazen than the Corleones . " Some guy recently called a station house and said he would kill a detective if he did n't stop harassing him , " says Strong . " It was n't an anonymous call , either . They knew who he was . That sounds to me like we lost the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
