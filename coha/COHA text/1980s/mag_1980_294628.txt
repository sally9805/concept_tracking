Thatcher buys American <P> President Carter was delighted with the decision . So was West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt . Basking in the approval of major NATO allies , Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 's government last week announced that it would buy the submarine-launched U.S. Trident missile system to replace an aging Polaris force and thereby upgrade Britain 's nuclear deterrent . It was a ringing reaffirmation of the long-standing special relationship between Washington and London . The costly decision was also evidence of Thatcher 's determination to keep Britain a nuclear power to be reckoned with . <P> In announcing the Trident deal to the House of Commons , Defense Secretary Francis Pym explained the government 's politico-military rationale . " We need to convince Soviet leaders , " he said , " that even if they thought at some critical point , as a conflict developed , that the U.S. would hold back , the British force could still inflict a blow so destructive that the penalty for aggression would have proved too high . " Britain will be nearly tripling its nuclear striking power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the U.S. 17 years ago , to 512 independently targetable warheads on 64 Tridents with a range of 4,350 miles . Britain has also consented to deploy 160 nuclear-tipped U.S. cruise mis siles , beginning in 1983 . <P> Pym assured the Commons that the Trident system was the " most cost-effective " successor to Polaris . The total program is estimated at $11.8 billion over 15 years-82.5 billion for the U.S. missiles , the remainder for four or possibly five new submarines and the warheads , all to be built in Britain . The U.S. , it is understood , is offering special terms : part of the Tridents ' expense will be offset by a U.S. purchase of British Rapier surface-to-air missiles at a cost of $370 million to guard American airbases in Britain . <P> Pym , however , was unable to win over Trident critics who fear that buying the system will weaken Britain 's conventional forces . The Labor Party 's shadow Defense Secretary , William Rodgers , told the Commons that " we simply can not afford " Trident . But some Labor M.P.s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipyard and electronics industries in their constituencies will benefit from the 200,000 new jobs that the Trident agreement is expected to create . ?
