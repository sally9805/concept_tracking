RENO , Nevada  --  A surge in the trading of Sierra Pacific Resources stock Monday baffled officials at this utility holding company . But the 100-fold increase in trading that day was caused by an increasingly common tax ploy used by brokerage houses and investors called a dividend play . More than 1. 6 million Sierra Pacific shares , or about 8% of the company ' s 19 million shares outstanding , were traded Monday . Yet , the company ' s stock closed unchanged at $18 a share , suggesting that there wasn ' t any takeover battle in the works . " It was purely a dividend play , " said John Havens , a block trader for Kidder Peabody &; Co. , which was involved in the action . He wouldn ' t elaborate on the details , but added that although dividend plays have been around for several years , " there ' s a much greater number of them now . There ' s a tremendous number of dividend trades these days . " Dividend plays are complex tax strategies that involve purchasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock . Mr. Havens said stocks with high dividend payments , such as utilities , insurance companies and banks , are typical targets . Yesterday ' s most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange was Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co . Total volume was about 3. 3 million shares , which included two block trades of 1. 6 million shares , and analysts said they were the result of dividend plays . The issued closed at $23 , down 12. 5 cents . Analysts said even AT &; in recent weeks traded heavily as a result of a dividend play . The unusual surges usually come on the last day buyers can qualify for dividends , and are often unrelated to the companies ' activities . Judy Holt , a trader with Johnson , Lane , Space , Smith &; Co. , a Georgia-based firm that does dividend trades , said " everybody does it in different ways , for different reasons . Every tax situation is different . " In Sierra Pacific ' s case , three large blocks changed hands , all at prices below the $18 opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares was traded at $17. 875 a share , a block of 544 , 000 at $17. 50 a share , and a block of 256 , 000 at $17. 375 a share . Monday was the last day to qualify for the company ' s 41. 5-cent-a-share dividend . John Pedersen , Sierra Pacific ' s corporate secretary , said his best assumption is that the transaction went this way : 800 , 000 shares were purchased by one party , and then sold in two blocks without the dividend at a lower price . Mr. Pedersen speculated that the same party was on both the buy and sell sides of the trade . The party selling the 800 , 000 shares at the lower price realized a loss of $322 , 000 . That ' s the same amount as the dividend payment on 800 , 000 shares . Mr. Pedersen said the seller got to recognize a $322 , 000 loss before taxes , or a net loss of $179 , 280 based on the corporate tax rate of 46% . Meanwhile , the seller got the $322 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on gains on dividends , so the dividend amounted to $309 , 092 after taxes . That gain minus the net loss on the sale of the stock resulted in a profit for the seller on the two transactions of $129 , 812 . " Somebody with a sharp pencil , " was responsible for the zoom in trades , Mr. Pedersen said . " All that trading was unrelated to anything we ' re doing .
