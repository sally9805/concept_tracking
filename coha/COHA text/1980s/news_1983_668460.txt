After Charles Abdella , a Democratic Issues Convention delegate , told a newspaper reporter that he might support former Vice President Walter F. Mondale at the convention ' s presidential straw poll , he received a telephone call from Washington . " Charlie ? This is Walter , " said the caller , who also happened to be the former vice president of the United States . The telephone call helped convince Abdella , a lawyer from Worcester , to cast his vote for Mondale last Saturday in Springfield . The choice was complicated for Abdella , despite the telephone call and a face-to-face visit at Mondale ' s campaign trailer at the Springfield Civic Center on Saturday morning , because prominent Democrats from his hometown were involved in several campaigns . Worcester ' s Daniel J. Foley , state Senate majority leader , backed US Sen. John Glenn , US Rep. Joseph D. Early supported Mondale and state Sen. Gerard D ' Amico endorsed US Sen. Gary Hart . " I was uncommitted until he made his speech , " said Abdella . The Globe tracked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Saturday ' s Springfield convention through a series of time-to-time interviews with the same group of delegates . When first interviewed in late February , and again in late March , most were undecided . Many , interviews yesterday showed , actually made their choices minutes before the balloting on Saturday . Many factors contributed to delegate decisions . The tally sheets show a clear pattern of influence by elected public officials . For example , state Sen. President William M. Bulger of South Boston brought in 65 percent of his senate district for his favorite , Ohio Sen. Glenn , although Glenn received only 15.3 percent of the vote overall . Mondale won the straw poll with 29.3 percent followed by " jobs " , organized labor ' s symbolic candidate , with 25.6 percent . California Sen. Alan Cranston received 16.9 ; Colorado Sen. Hart , 10.4 ; and So . Carolina Sen. Ernest Hollings and former Florida Gov . Reubin Askew received less than one percent . What follows are the choices of some of these delegates sampled by theGlobe . Roger Smith , a retired US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards Mondale , his former neighbor in Washington , but had Hart " in my hip pocket " . He voted for Hart because " I think he is solid and I want him to stay in the race . He doesn ' t have a lot of name recognition and if he does badly here I ' m afraid he may not survive . I think he is going to look a lot like JFK . If he can stay in the race a lot of young people will go for him . " Judith Lech , a junior high school teacher from Hampden , who expressed an interest in Mondale ' s candidacy during the first interview , voted for Mondale despite some reservations . Just hours before the voting , Lech still thought she would vote " no preference " as recommended by the Massachusetts Teachers Assn . After the candidates spoke , " I decided I would much rather take a positive action , " she said . Joseph Mello , of Lowell , a vice president of the Massachusetts State Labor Council ( AFL-CIO ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supported the labor strategy from the start and helped pull off the strong showing at the end . " It ' s much too early in the presidential campaign to take a hard and fast positionn on a candidate because it could change drastically in the next six months , " he said . Mark Fitzgerald , a 25-year-old law school student from Sudbury , cast his " purely pragmatic " vote for Glenn . " I don ' t know if he can win but I think he has as good a chance as any to beat a Republican , " he said . " I don ' t agree with him on all the issues but a large portion of the party left the party three years ago . If we don ' t give them some reason to come back they won ' t . " Charles Yancey , a management consultant and black community leader from Boston , at first considered sitting it out until after all the presidential candidates responded to a 73-page issues questionnaire from the ad hoc caucus of minority convention delegates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excellent job by coming out early and endorsing Harold Washington , " the black mayoral candidate in Chicago . Richard Bell , a writer from Cambridge who went to the convention as a part of the group advocating legal abortions , initially resented the straw poll . He found himself caught up in the excitement of the campaigning and voted for Cranston after hearing him speak twice . " I decided I was more interested in giving his campaign a boost at this time so that he could continue running a strong campaign for the next couple of months . He is such a clear voice on the weapons issue that I would like to see him stay in the race and keep that issue as sharp and pointed as possible , " he said . Katharine Deneen , a housewife and mother of four who lives in Winthrop , went with Cranston . " I ' m still really impressed by him and I ' m not impressed by the others . He can beat Reagan . He has outpolled Reagan in California . That sort of popularity made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suzanne Gill , a 35-year old mother of two and a Delta Airlines employeefrom Lynn , decided to back Hart after hearing him speak at the Holiday Inn in Peabody last Thursday night . " I think he ' s going to be terrific . When we want someone to beat Reagan , I think he is going to be it . We have to give people a real choice . He is an intelligent young Democrat who is really going to go places . " What swayed her was his answer to her question on airline deregulation . " He answered me truthfully . It wasn ' t what I wanted to hear but that didn ' t matter , he didn ' t give me a lot of bull , " she said . Louis Russo , 64 , a lifelong employee at General Electric in Pittsfield . " We all got together and decided Glenn was our boy " in Pittsfield , he said . Former Pittsfield Mayor and US Chief of Protocol Evan S. Dobelle and current Pittsfield Mayor Ray DelGallo worked the Pittsfield area delegates hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He didn ' t seem like phony baloney , " said Russo who added , " I suppose if you ' re a Democrat they all look good . " Pauline Travis , a machine operator at a small manufacturing plant in Fall River and vice president of the local chapter of Massachusetts Fair Share , voted for " jobs " . " It ' s an issues convention and I want to address the issues , " she said . She said she resented the fact that the straw poll overshadowed the issues portion of the convention . Lois Pines , the former state representative and bottle bill advocate from Newton , voted for " jobs " because she didn ' t feel quite ready to choose a candidate . " I have limited my choice to a few candidates and been meeting with the candidates and I would hope to play a significant role in the campaign of one of them . I don ' t feel I was prepared as of today to choose . I need a little more time . My commitment is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vote will be a commitment for the duration . "
