A standout is his 1916 portrait of Umberto Boccioni , the painter , sculptor and Futurist theoretician - a masklike face of wonderfully serious mien hovering in space , with two- thirds of a triangle for a nose . But by this time , Carr a was already ditching Futurism for the dreamlike " metaphysical " style of de Chirico . In Chiricoesque paintings , he returned to Renaissance perspective , juxtaposing such incongruous motifs as deserted streets , dress dummies , ancient ruins , biscuits , fragments of sculpture and other oddities , to convey the angst and mystery behind surface reality. // Among the drawings of this period are " The Black Cat " ( 1919 ) , a delightfully jokey rendition of a black cat seen from the rear , scrutinizing a Cubist painting , and " Standing Man " ( 1920 ) , a simplified half-human , half- mannequin figure that fleetingly recalls one of Picasso ' s blue-period acrobats , leaning against what might be a bar rail. // For all his shifts in style , Carr a , who was also an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like his followers today ) in Italian art of the past . Even before his Futurist involvement , he had closely studied the paintings of Giotto and Paolo Uccello . In the early 1920 ' s , he began trying to tie his work in more closely with that of classical tradition . Studying Cezanne , he developed an interest in landscape painting and worked to produce a style of his own . The interesting thing is that the style he evolved - as was the case with de Chirico after his metaphysical period - was insipid and decorative : devoted to classical landscapes and seascapes carrying boats with wind- filled sails . Never was his art more derivative than when it stopped being part of a movement . But it ' s the " late " Carr a that seems to attract the young Italian artists. // The drawings from the early part of the later period , however , are by no means uninteresting . There ' s a lovely humor in " Interior " ( 1922 ) , a faux- na " if work , in which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended by a small dog and some furniture props . " Twilight , " of the same year , is a simple farmscape , whose animals - unexpectedly - are stylized with great sophistication . " Mother and Daughter , " from 1922 , with thematic echoes of " Interior , " is a cartoon far gone in grossness ; " Female Figure " ( 1933 ) is a charmingly airy treatment of the nude . After the early 1930 ' s , good drawings by Carr a are hard to find . But this show has some beauties and confers a bonus in the perspective it lends to the new Italian art. // // Also of interest this week : <> <> Gustav Klimt ( Galerie St. Etienne , 24 West 57th Street ) : There ' s not much in the way of major paintings by Gustav Klimt ( 1862-1918 ) to see outside his native Vienna , since their fragility precludes travel . We usually have to make do in this country with shows of his drawings - no hardship , since this modern Viennese master is among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women ( his almost exclusive preoccupation ) with a nervous line that has the animating force of electricity . Among the 50 drawings in this exhibition - which also includes a small selection of paintings - are a number of studies for portraits , and a group of nudes , a few in erotic circumstances and others waiting to be transferred to canvas and smothered by the artist in the compulsive overload of ornament for which he was noted. // Looking at these drawings , we feel that no one can convey the alluring languorousness of sleeping bodies in quite the way that Klimt could , or chronicle so precisely the way limbs relate to the torso . If he had a feeling for naked flesh , he also had a sharp eye for the costumes that cover it , and he could detail with the most minimal of strokes the exact way clothes hang on the body . His observations rarely extended to males , but one strange drawing here - considering that Klimt never married - is a presumed self-portrait that shows a man in a short , Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms. // The chronologically arranged show , beginning with the stilted academic work of Klimt ' s early years , also includes some interesting paintings : among them " Island in the Attersee " ( circa 1901 ) , a gorgeous , almost Pointillist rendition of water built of blue and pink and yellow flecks ; and another Attersee view , done 16 years later , of a wooded river bank , arresting in its detailed chromatic transition from neat ranks of houses and pines along the river to a teeming mob of trees on the bank . And there ' s a very odd Symbolist work of 1898 , " Moving Water , " which shows a tumult of women ' s bodies floating in a stream , observed from underneath in wide-eyed wonder by a primeval ( male ) creature. // This is by no means a major show - in fact , some of the drawings in it are really only of marginal exhibition quality . But any Klimt display is to be reckoned with . ( Through next Saturday. ) // <> <> Michael Lekakis ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) : This small but very lively show touches on five decades of watercolors and drawings by Michael Lekakis , who is first and foremost a sculptor . The earliest pieces , from the late 1930 ' s , are blocky , Cubistic figure studies that appeal through warm color and immediately reveal his sculptural sensibility , a sensibility that pervades the rest of the show . After the early watercolors , the palette is almost exclusively black and white , and by the 1940 ' s , his forms became more organic , as seen in " Lion , " a bold black beast composed of biomorphic parts , which also reads like a reclining human figure . Two works from the same period - white on black - reflect , through abstracted figures , what seem like Japanese dance movements . They relate , in their frenzied evocation of motion , to a 1964 piece , " Tops , " in which a wildly spinning top seems to take on the form of a dancer. // An interesting departure from the prevailing organic forms of the 1940 ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , a structure of white squares and rectangles set against a ground of hatched black and white polygons . It ' s unmistakably a human figure , however , as totemically assertive as " Isometrist , " 1951 , a stark , iconic male-female form built up of rounded body segments . Minimalism invades the Lekakis work in the 1960 ' s and 70 ' s but , while these diamonds and squares and rectangles make effective figure-ground relationships , they lack the joyous conviction of the earlier work . Several sculptures from the 1940 ' s , of carved wood , are beautifully made but give a feeling of Brancusi revisited . ( Through next Saturday. ) // This show is the first in a series the gallery plans to devote to the work of Greek-American artists . It ' s off to a good start. // <> <> Marina Cappelletto ( Pam Adler Gallery , 37 West 57th Street ) : What ' s striking at first sight of these oils on plywood by Marina Cappelletto is their luscious paint quality and the sharp brilliance of their colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains that sometimes become other structures and water that might be land . And sometimes these water-landscapes are haunted by a strange phantom , as for instance in " Pinned Spirit , " in which four simplified sugar loaf peaks overlook a flat mesa . On it , lies the shadow of a Thothlike figure , pinned to the ground by four blue stakes. // The surreality of these paintings , in which the artist explores contradictory memories of childhood , is arresting , achieved as it is by cool handling of very personal themes . ( Through Nov. 12. ) //
