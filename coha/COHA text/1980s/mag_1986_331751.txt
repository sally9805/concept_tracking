Betty Friedan has dubbed it a " deceptive , backlash book . " Erica Jong has called it the kind of work that " could start a revolution " and " serve as blueprint for a new era of feminist activism . " Those heated reactions were only a small part of a new controversy slowly beginning to churn in U.S. feminist circles . Its focus : a newly published 461-page study that examines why , despite the furor of the feminist revolution in the ' 60s and ' 70s , women in the U.S. labor force remain substantially poorer than their West European counterparts . The book 's most startling claim : the feminist movement itself may be responsible for some of that discrepancy . <P> Author Sylvia Ann Hewlett , 40 , pursues that analysis with a wealth of fact , interviews and occasional personal reflections , in A Lesser Life : The Myth of Women 's Liberation in America ( Morrow ; $17.95 ) . The book is the product of three years of research by the author , an economist and director of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was increasingly struck by the income disparity between European and American women , a plight she illustrates with cold statistics . As of August 1985 , Census Bureau figures show that women in the U.S. earn 64 cents for each dollar earned by males , up only 1 cents since 1939 . European women , by contrast , have been gaining on men much more rapidly . In Sweden , for example , women now average 81% of male annual earnings , up from 71% in 1970 . In France , women 's wages are 78% of men 's , and in Italy , the figure is 86% . <P> America 's divorce rate , one of the highest in the world , holds down female earning power , says Hewlett , and so does discrimination against women workers . But she thinks the major factor holding women back is their continuing burden in the home , particularly the responsibility of child rearing . Hewlett writes : " Ninety percent of women have children , and . . . it is precisely during the childbearing years that women fail to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking in the U.S. , she says , is the absence of social legislation and universal social support for working mothers . No fewer than 117 nations guarantee maternity leave , and the U.S. is the only advanced democracy not on the list . Though women employed by major American corporations are mostly protected , she observes , more than 60% of U.S. working mothers have no right to take maternity time off . " American superwomen are meant to have children on the side , on their own time , and the less said about it the better , " says Hewlett . " In this country there is little appreciation of the fact that having children is a societal imperative as well as a private choice , that children are a nation 's collective future . " <P> The British-born Hewlett , mother of four children , gained some of her knowledge about that problem the hard way . Part of the inspiration for Lesser Life grew out of her own agonies in juggling career and motherhood while teaching economics at Barnard College in the 1970s . Barnard granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her inability to get time off during a difficult pregnancy contributed to her miscarriage of twins . Hewlett also relates that her department chairman warned that she might not gain tenure if she got pregnant again . Eventually she was refused tenure .
