The stove made me feel stupid , and so did the salesman . I do n't know what 's wrong with me . The T. V. ads make me think I can understand anything . But that stove scared me .

" All the KIDS , except DAVEY , rush across whole stage area to help DAD . They hold brightly painted boards in a constantly changing slow motion arrangement for DAD to work on .

With this encouragement DAVEY runs to talk to DAD . p. 38 DAVEY KRAAZ ( Spoken rapidly ) Dad , hey Dad , do you think it 's possible that I could get this bike . It has wheels like this , and it 's a Huffy bike , and has blue stripes here . And Jimmy Erickson has a red one sort of like it , but it 's last year 's and when you ride it you can ride it so that it 's like a dirt bike , a motorcycle , get it , but it 's still a bike that it 's o.k. and safe for a kid to ride . And I want one so much and I do n't know when it was that I wanted anything like this and if you buy it for me , I 'll never ask you for anything again . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean my room and make Mom happy and I 'll even do the laundry , my socks and stuff , I mean . And I 'll be quiet at Sunday school and not embarrass you by being asked to go out and wait in the car . And I 'll watch any TV program you say without whining . ( a new tactic  --  leaps front , clutching heart ) And I want this bike like it 's hurting my heart I want it so much . ( convulsing with feeling ) I know you 'd want me to have it if you knew how much feeling I have in my body . ( It seems DAD is n't responding , so DAVEY begins to take away the pieces DAD is hammering or sanding , one at a time . ) It 's just killing me not to have this bike . It 's called a Huffy bike , and it has wheels with , like , teeth on them . They can grab the dirt so you do n't slide and fall over , and I wont get skinned knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can already ride Jimmy 's when he lets me , but he wo n't let me ride it too often ' cause he 's always riding it himself . And if I had this bike I could get a paper route and help with buying my school clothes , and you probably would n't have to even give me much of an allowance if I had this paper route , and . . .

Have you tried making a definite appointment to talk with him ? GREGG KRAAZ I do n't think so . DEBBY KRAAZ ( Sits ) It 's a bit of a shock for Dad to have such a brilliant son . Your Dad and his Dad are two peas in a pod . Your mind developed so rapidly this last year . Maybe he is n't used to it . p. 45 GREGG KRAAZ I 'm not either . Answers come to me like lightning .

DEBBY KRAAZ He says he ca n't talk to you because it 's like talking to God , and he does n't know how to talk to God . PHILLIP KRAAZ That 's ridiculous . He 's a walking computer .

JENNIFER KRAAZ Well , it was just because of your doing that with your leg , and it is n't even in rhythm . KEVIN KRAAZ Do you like to do that with your leg ? GREGG KRAAZ I never thought about whether I liked it . KEVIN KRAAZ Does it give you Charley 's Horse in your leg ? DAVEY KRAAZ What 's that ? DIANE KRAAZ A knot inside your leg that tangles up the tendons or muscles , and then you have to massage it out , or run it out . JENNIFER AND GREGG Yeah , it does that .
