Shortly after he received an artificial heart in 1984 , William Schroeder was euphoric . " I feel like I 've got ten years left right now , " he exulted . But that was not to be . Last week at Humana Hospital Audubon in Louisville , the former Government quality-control inspector , who was 54 , suffered a massive stroke . Tuesday morning he was discovered unconscious with labored breathing ; 30 hours later his breathing had stopped for good . With Schroeder 's family gathered round , doctors pronounced him dead , but there remained a last grim task : to turn off the pneumatically driven device that had kept him alive for 20 months . Surgeon William DeVries put his hand on the chrome key in the front of the refrigerator-size air console ; then Schroeder 's wife Margaret and their six children , one by one , laid theirs atop his . Together they twisted the key counterclockwise , and the artificial heart beat no more . <P> Schroeder 's death marked the end of a valiant struggle for life , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent implants of the Jarvik-7 heart . Though Schroeder lived a record 620 days  --  almost a third longer than Artificial Heart Recipient Murray Haydon , who died in June  --  it was a seesaw survival that mixed moments of triumph with stretches of pain and anguish for both him and his family . " It 's incredible how many times he had medical complications that would have finished a normal person , " says DeVries . <P> Within days of the implant , Schroeder was up , cracking jokes and drinking beer . But in less than three weeks , he suffered multiple strokes , a complication that has plagued three of the five permanent Jarvik-7 heart recipients . The seizures left him partly paralyzed , with impaired speech and memory . He recovered enough to move across the street from the hospital into a specially equipped apartment , where he lived with his wife and was attended by nurses and technicians . That idyll lasted barely a month before a second stroke . Again he fought back and eventually he was able to make a trip to his hometown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand marshal . He went fishing with his sons and Artificial Heart Developer Robert Jarvik and celebrated his 33rd wedding anniversary at a Louisville restaurant . <P> But last November Schroeder suffered another stroke that left him bedridden , semiconscious and unable to speak . By Christmas his condition had so deteriorated that his family and doctors decided not to connect him to a respirator should his lungs fail . Schroeder lingered in a twilight state for seven months , until last week . Family members , summoned to his bedside , initially balked at the doctors ' request for a CAT scan but finally agreed . The test confirmed that a massive stroke had destroyed most of Schroeder 's brain , and last rites were given . <P> Schroeder 's troubled history , and that of other permanent Jarvik-7 patients , has led critics to call for a temporary halt in the program . Examination of some of the implanted hearts has revealed accumulations of platelets , which can contribute to blood clots in the brain , in the devices ' crevices and along the path blood travels . Says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jarvik-7 implant operation on Barney Clark and is now head of the artificial-heart program at the Minneapolis Heart Institute : " It is time to wait for new modifications of the Jarvik-7.
