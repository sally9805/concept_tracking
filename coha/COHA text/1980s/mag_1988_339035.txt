HELP WANTED ! PUH-LEEZE ! I 'm an actress with great refs , awards galore , star quality . Can play comedy or drama , aristocrat or working girl , sweet or sexy , any or all of the above . Critics love me , and moviegoers too . But my career 's in neutral . Chewy female roles are hard to come by if your name is n't Meryl Streep . Still , I have lots to offer . What can Hollywood offer me ? <P> Starlight is capricious . Its beam falls on the worthy and the fortunate , then moves restlessly on . In the era of the omnipotent film studios , performers were cushioned by long-term contracts and paternalistic moguls . A career was built through steady work in look-alike roles . But in these free-for-all days , actors  --  and especially actresses  --  are on their own . They are defined more as artists than as stars ; they market their craft , not their luminous personalities . They may win star parts or , on a lark , show up in cameo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the theater or have a baby . The easy momentum of the golden age has vanished in an industry where most of the box- office breadwinners are men , and an actress 's career rides on an audience 's whim . The combustible element used to be star meets star ; now it is star finds perfect role . But what if too many good actresses are scrambling for too few good scripts ? <P> Debra Winger , Amy Irving , Rosanna Arquette : moviemakers should be begging to ! snare these actresses for fat and sassy leading roles . No such luck . Irving has for a dozen years commuted easily between stage ( Amadeus , The Road to Mecca ) and screen ( Carrie , Yentl ) , but movies have rarely caught her witchy allure . Arquette seemed a cinch for stardom after Desperately Seeking Susan , but her elfin sensuality has proved too weird for mainstream fare . As for the wondrous Winger , she anchored three big hits of the early ' 80s . But after Urban Cowboy , An Officer and a Gentleman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike 's Murder ; nobody needed to see Legal Eagles . She was outglammed by Theresa Russell in Black Widow and nearly unrecognizable as a hobo angel in Made in Heaven . <P> What 's a gal to do ? Take what she can get , work hard and hope . The three new , earnest , off-Hollywood movies from this star-worthy trio  --  Irving 's Crossing Delancey , Arquette 's The Big Blue and Winger 's Betrayed  --  suggest that when a project has doom scrawled across it , even an incandescent actress ca n't save the day . If her luck breaks even , maybe she can save herself . <P> There is no salvation for Irving in Director Joan Micklin Silver 's Crossing Delancey . The star , playing a Manhattan bookstore manager named Isabelle Grossman , is made to look tired and behave with moral myopia . Ca n't Isabelle see that the European author ( Jeroen Krabbe ) who courts her is just one more serpent-eyed wordsmith who would flatter a pretty woman 's intellect to soften her resolve ? Ca n't she tell that sweet-souled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the old neighborhood , is the guy for her ? Isabelle 's Yiddishe grandma ( Reizl Bozyk ) can tell , in cliches that fall from her lips like ripe plums .
