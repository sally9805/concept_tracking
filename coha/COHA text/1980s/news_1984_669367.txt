Its legislature has enacted a bill to let bank holding companies from within a defined 10-state Southern region buy or merge with their Georgia counterparts . But the regional interstate banking party won ' t start until another Southern legislature passes a reciprocal law , allowing Georgia institutions into its territory. // But wait a minute , you say , don ' t we already have interstate banking ? There are out-of-state banks , foreign banks even , right downtown in my city . What about all those letters I ' ve been getting from South Dakota , offering pre-approved credit cards ? And didn ' t that nice woman at the bank say my automatic teller card could get me cash at zillions of locations all over the country ? // It ' s just this sort of confusion that has Southern bankers eager to proceed with de jure , rather than just de facto , interstate banking .

Joe Frank Harris , ' ' will allow the influx of additional capital to the state of Georgia , ' ' Senator Lester says .

' ' // But part of the rationale for regional interstate banking , an idea recommended last summer by the Southern Growth Policies Board in Raleigh , N.C. , has been to create a breathing space for Southern banks , to allow them to become real regional powers before the whole country opens up to national banking across state lines - a development seen as inevitable. // Says Georgia Banking Commissioner Jack Dunn , ' ' Our part of the country needs to strengthen and enlarge its large banks. ' ' // ' ' This region does not have major nationally competitive banks , ' ' says Joe Martin , senior vice-president of NCNB Corporation in Charlotte , the biggest bank holding company in North Carolina and the only Southeastern bank to squeak onto last year ' s list of the top 25 US bank holding companies - albeit in last place .

' ' The new bill ' ' will allow First Atlanta to grow and compete with money center banks . It will be a real opportunity for business , especially for the larger companies , because the Southeastern institutions will be big enough to meet their needs , instead of their having to go to New York or Chicago.
