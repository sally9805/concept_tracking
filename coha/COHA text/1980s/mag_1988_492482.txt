September ' 88 HOW SAFE IS OUR BLOOD SUPPLY ? by John Pekkanen Elk or 21/2 years the Centers for Dis-ease Control ( CDC ) in Atlanta gathered the unsettling evidence . First , two Colorado men who had received blood from the same donor tested positive for the AIDS virus . Then , following a car accident , a 66-yearold woman contracted AIDS from a transfusion and died a year later . Next a 55-year-old man developed classic symptoms of AIDS 20 months after receiving plasma during coronary bypass surgery . In all , the CDC found 13 of these cases that occurred after mandatory testing of the nation 's blood supply for human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) began in 1985 . Every year about 3.5 million Americans receive one or more units of blood in a transfusion . What are the chances of getting AIDS or hepatitis  --  the two biggest concerns  --  from it ? And how can you minimize your Tisk ? Ross D. Eckert , an economics professor at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont , Calif. , has written widely on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing began , government officials and blood bankers suggested the public 's concern about the blood supply was unwarranted hysteria . In my view it was completely rational  --  and still is . " According to CDC estimates , more than 10,000 Americans are infected with the AIDS virus , because of transfusions , and an additional 10,000 people with hemophilia are also HIV positive . Many do n't even know they . have the disease , and can infect others . As yet , there has been no systematic national effort to trace all these people . This makes James Shannon , a 52-year-old Washington , D.C. , businessman , very angry . ( Names of victims in this special report have been changed to protect privacy . ) In late 1982 Shannon underwent coronary bypass surgery that required 20 units of red blood cells . ( A unit is the amount taken from a pint of blood . ) Shannon recovered quickly , but later felt too ill to function well . " The idea that I could have AIDS never crossed my mind , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that said people who had received transfusions between 1978 and 1985 were at risk . He was tested , and his worst fears were confirmed . " What angers me , " Shannon says , " is that neither the hospital where I was operated on nor the Red Cross that supplied the blood ever contacted me about AIDS . If I had been sexually promiscuous , there 's no telling how many people 1 could have infected . " He says he 'd be much angrier if his wife had gotten AIDS . Thus far , all her tests have been negative . What also angers a number of experts is that the blood industry and the federal government failed to do all they could to safeguard the supply when AIDS began spreading in the early 1980s . Many blood bankers and federal officials deny this . But industry critics contend there were ways to reduce the risk of transfusion AIDS nearly two years before the present test went into effect . They say blood bankers , to protect their own interests , ignored these methods . Guilt by Association Blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . It collects almost 13 million pints of blood a year from volunteer donors and sells nearly 30 million units of blood products . The American Red Cross , the biggest player , collects about half the donated blood . Independent banks collect some 40 percent , and hospitals take in the rest . ( Apart from the nonprofit blood industry , there are commercial plasma centers that collect mostly plasma from paid donors ; this is then manufactured into a variety of blood products . ) Annual sales of nonprofit blood amount to $1 billion . In 1986 Money magazine concluded that if Red Cross Blood Services were a for-profit corporation , its fiscal 1985 revenues would place it number 473 among the Fortune 500 , and its hypothetical 8.8-percent earnings would tie for 50th place . " Blood banks are portrayed as heroic , altruistic organizations , " says economist Eckert . " But in fact in most communities they have been either monopolies or cartels . Tighter screening forces them to discard more product , which means lost revenues , and to solicit even more donors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AIDS threat . " Eckert is not the only one who feels blood banks took too much time to respond . Dr. Edgar Engleman , medical director of the Stanford University Blood Bank in Palo Alto , Calif. , concluded by early 1983 that it was " patently obvious " AIDS was transmitted by blood and probably constituted a much bigger problem than generally acknowledged . Engleman 's concern led him to adopt a blood screening test for AIDS . His was the first known blood bank in the nation to do so . While his test would not find AIDS directly , it identified abnormal white-cell ratios associated with AIDS patients and people in high-risk groups , such as homosexuals and intravenous drug abusers . Such " surrogate tests " determine guilt by association . The Stanford blood bank started screening in July 1983 , nearly two years before mandatory AIDS testing . To pay for the test , the bank added $6 to the cost of each transfusion . " No patients complained , " Engle-man says . Donor 's Confession The following spring , a frantic call came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An AIDS patient had just told him that he had donated blood at Stanford and other banks in our area , " Engleman recalls . " Our records showed his blood had tested abnormal and was thrown out . Unfortunately , the other banks gave his blood to as many as 1I recipients . " With the advent of the present AIDS test ( called ELISA , for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ) in March 1985 , Engleman went back to see how well his surrogate test had worked . Seven and a half percent of the " high-risk " blood he had discarded was infected . But for each 1000 specimens from blood that had tested safe and been transfused , one tested positive for the AIDS virus . So Engle-man 's test , while not perfect , had undoubtedly reduced transfusion AIDS at Stanford . If his test had any chance of succeeding , why did n't other blood bankers rush to use it ? " I do n't contend the blood bankers should have used our test , " says Engleman . " But they could easily have started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a surrogate AIDS test . This would have been a good test to help prevent transfusion AIDS , and they were well set up to do it . " This second procedure detects antibodies at the core of the hepatitis B virus . According to a 1983 CDCstudy of AIDS patients , these antibodies were present in all intravenous drug users and in 88 percent of male homosexuals . By identifying this high-risk blood , the surrogate test could have prevented some cases of transfusion AIDS . Blood banks in San Francisco , along with a few other areas , where fear of transfusion AIDS ran highest , instituted just such a test in the spring of 1984 . ( Some commercial plasma centers had also been using the test . ) But all the other blood banks refused . They continued to assure the public that all that should be done was being done . Dr. James P. AuBuchon , medical officer at the American Red Cross national headquarters in Washington , D.C. , replies that the surrogate testing Engleman used was impractical . " It 's an expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough instruments in the country to perform it . It would have been logistically impossible to do 13 million tests a year . And the hepatitis B core antibody test is not reliable for AIDS . " However , clear evidence that the hepatitis test would have curbed AIDS comes from Dr. Herbert Perkins , director of the Irwin Memorial Blood Bank in San Francisco . Irwinbegan using the hepatitis antibody test in May 1984 ? nearly a year before the ELISA test was available . " Looking back , we now know that 40 percent of donors who test positive for AIDS also test positive for the hepatitis B antibody . So our testing did prevent a certain percentage of AIDS cases . " Closing the " Window " Given the past foot-dragging , how well is the blood supply protected now ? The first line of defense is that donors are asked not to give blood if they have been exposed to infectious diseases , such as malaria , hepatitis or AIDS , or if they are in a high-risk group for AIDS . Unfortunately , the 13 recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense . To find out why , the CDC located and interviewed six of them . " Most were homosexual or bisexual men , " reports Dr. Scott Holmberg , a medical epidemiologist with the AIDS program at CDC . " One was a woman who had sexual contact with a former 1 . V. drug abuser . In one disturbing case , a gay man admitted donating blood to get a free AIDS test . " The blood of these people also eluded the second line of defense  --  laboratory testing . The ELISA test does not reveal the AIDS virus itself , but the antibodies that form in response to it . The problem is that the immune system usually takes three months to produce detectable numbers of these antibodies . The blood of an infected person can slip through this " window . " How much is slipping through ? No one knows . But the CDC estimates that a patient 's chance of getting infected with the AIDS virus from a unit of transfused blood is about one in 100,000 . By contrast , the average person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year is about one in 5000 . However , the CDC points out , it is n't presently known whether all or just some of the people infected with the virus will eventually develop AIDS . Researchers are looking for better ways to screen blood . " Experimental tests are picking up the AIDS virus only a week after infection , " says Dr. Frank Young , commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , the federal agency that regulates the nation 's blood supply . " But a version for routine use is probablytwo years away . " Until then , the final word on the risk of transfusion AIDS comes from the authors of the CDC study . They call the risk " remote but real . " Big Chill Even if a foolproof AIDS test for HIV is developed , it 's likely that new risks  --  new viruses  --  will emerge to imperil the blood supply . Last December , doctors at the University of Medicine and Dentistry in Newark , N.J. , examined a woman who had been losing weight for three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found brain lesions typical of AIDS  --  but she tested negative for the disease . The woman had recently migrated to the United States from West Africa , where a virus called HIV-2 is prevalent . She became the first HIV-2 victim in the United States , and her case symbolizes a new menace to the nation 's blood supply . HIV-2 and another virus called HTLV-1 ( human T-cell lymphotropic virus ) , along with AIDS , are in the same family of retroviruses . ( A retrovirus is a type of virus that processes its genetic information differently from other viruses. ) 1-11V-2 causes an AIDS-like disease . HTLV-I causes a devastating form of adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia , and a nerve disorder called tropical spastic paraparesis , which resembles multiple sclerosis . Both viruses are believed to be transmitted the same way as AIDS  --  by sexual contact , needle sharing and blood , and from mother to unborn child . Heavy pockets of HTLV-1 have long existed in southern Japan and the Caribbean , and to a lesser extent in central Africa . More recently , the virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in many large U.S. cities . HIV-2 has been found in West Africa and two European countries . Early last year , the Red Cross , using experimental tests , randomly checked 39,898 units of donor blood for antibodies to HTLV-I . The tests turned up ten units of HTLV-I positive blood , or 21/2 units per 10,000 . This makes the risk of getting HTLV-I through a transfusion higher than the risk of getting AIDS . A survey of 8503 blood samples by the CDC and FDA found no HIV-2 . " Approving a test for HTLV-I is one of our highest priorities now , " says FDA Commissioner Young . " We hope to approve one any mo- ment . And the HIV-2 test will be right behind it . " Meanwhile , a researcher in Italy may have found yet another retrovirus he calls HTLV-V , which causes another type of lymphoma . Are even more viruses coming ? " We do n't know , " says CDC 's Holmberg . " It 's possible that AIDS may be just one piece in a larger puzzle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be chilled . " Hepatitis Risk Just one week after his discharge from cardiac surgery , Paul Griffith , in his early 60s , began feeling weak . " I 'd walk ten minutes and sleep four hours , " he says . Tests revealed he was suffering from hepatitis , a serious infectious disease of the liver . Because pre-admission tests showed he did n't have hepatitis , Griffith knew he 'd contracted it from transfusions . His type of hepatitis is called Non-A , Non-B ( NANB ) . Griffith 's fatigue persisted . Soon he was forced to retire from his law practice . Two years later , a biopsy revealed that Griffith , a teetotaler , had cirrhosis , a harmful inflammation of the liver caused by the hepatitis . For the past six years , because there is no effective treatment for NANB hepatitis , Griffith has suffered recurrent fevers , chills , hemorrhaging and abdominal pains . He is dogged by fatigue and poor appetite . He has lost 70 pounds . " I ca n't fault anyone , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not until the AIDS crisis focused attention on the blood supply did the risk of hepatitis come to full public view . Before blood banks started new NANB hepatitis screening tests in 1986 , the chances of getting this disease from a transfusion were about one in ten . That made hepatitis by far the greatest transfusion risk , with 300,000 to 400,000 transmissions each year . Now , with new tests , some experts feel the risk has been cut to one in 20 . Ninety percent of transfusion hepatitis is NANB . Most of the rest is hepatitis B , a form that can persist and , in some cases , kill . A third kind , hepatitis A , poses little transfusion risk because it is an acute illness with no chronic carriers . In the 1970s , blood banks took steps to protect against hepatitis B , which was then thought to be the most prevalent form . They began using a test that detects the virus . They also stopped paying donors . Studies proved that paid donors  --  many from skid row  --  had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NANB hepatitis , however , continues to threaten transfusion recipients because there is no test to detect the virus or its antibodies . Most people with NANB hepatitis do n't realize they have it . Many of them unknowingly donate blood . In late 1986 blood banks finally began using two surrogate tests for NANB . One is the hepatitis B core antibody test  --  the same test Engleman advocated as a surrogate screening for AIDS . Studies find that people who test positive for hepatitis B antibodies are also at risk of NANB . The second test is called alanine aminotransferase , which measures liver enzymes whose blood levels are raised by many things , including alcohol consumption and NANB hepatitis . Experiments suggest that virtually everyone given NANB-tainted blood becomes infected . Sooner or later , half of those infected get chronic hepatitis , and ten percent go on to develop liver cirrhosis . Even with the NANB surrogate tests , a patient 's chance of developing cirrhosis from blood transfusions is one in 200 . Though testing has made the blood supply considerably safer , the risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has announced it has identified the NANB virus . " Preliminary results are very encouraging , " says Dr. Harvey J. Alter , chief of immunology at the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) department of transfusion medicine . " If the discovery is confirmed , it will represent a major advance in the prevention of NANB hepatitis . A specific NANB test within two years is now an attainable goal . " Beating the Odds " There 's always going to be a new virus or a permutation of an existing virus , and we 're always playing catchup , " says Dr. Harvey Klein , chief of transfusion medicine at NIH . " Ideally , we 'd like to have something to eliminate all viruses from the blood . " Klein 's idea is not science fiction . Two methods of deactivating viruses ? called " blood cleansing " ? are now under study . One uses laser beams , the other chemicals . " For massive blood screening , both of these techniques are still a way off , " says the FDA 's Young . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term is misleading , because the real focus of research is the development of chemically modified hemoglobin , the oxygen-carrying protein in blood . In animal experiments , this chemical solution delivers oxygen as well as and possibly better than natural blood . Gene-splicing techniques may be used to mass-produce it . We could see limited use of this " artificial blood " in patients as soon as a year from now . The substance would most benefit patients who lose massive amounts of blood in surgery or trauma . Blood salvage . This method collects blood a patient loses during surgery and pumps it into a machine that separates out the red cells , washes them and reinfuses them into the patient . Blood salvage can sometimes eliminate or minimize the need for transfusions  --  but it requires a $35,000 machine and a technician to run it . ( A few major hospitals around the country now offer this service . ) Self-donation . Storing your own blood is the surest way to eliminate risk . Because you can donate up to apint of blood a week under optimal conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can store about five units before some surgeries . Consult your physician first , however . Commercial firms now offer blood-freezing for up to ten years . The annual cost is about $150 per unit . But frozen blood requires time to thaw , and would not be available in some emergencies . " Creating your own blood bank not only protects you against infections , but also protects you against certain adverse reactions that occur in five percent of donor transfusions , " says Dr. Joseph Feldschuh , president of Idant Laboratories in New York City . While self-donation laboratories are regulated by the FDA , quality control is not uniform . Ask for recommendations from your area blood bank and your physician . Designated donation . This involves simply asking friends and relatives to donate . Most blood banks allow this , but discourage it because there is no evidence that such blood is safer . " If you know the donors very well and are sure they are not in a high-risk group , designated donation may protect you against transfusion AIDS , " says the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think it 's any help at all . " One sure way to reduce transfusion risk is to cut the number done . " I ca n't prove it , " Young says , " but I think many transfusions are unnecessary . We have to educate our physicians better in this regard , and develop clearer guidelines . " Until that happens , given the tests available , the blood supply is as safe as can reasonably be expected . Says Dr. Thomas S. Asher , chairman of HemaCare , a commercial blood-technology firm in Sherman Oaks , Calif. : " Over the years , the nonprofit blood industry grew big and arrogant and began to lose sight of its goal of service . But in the past year or so the blood bankers have truly seen the light and are more responsive . It 's called consumerism , and the public will be better served because of it . " This new commitment , coupled with technology , may someday make the blood supply completely safe . For the present , though , it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a risky form of medical therapy  --  but it can also save your life .
