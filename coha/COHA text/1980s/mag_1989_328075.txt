THE HEIDI CHRONICLES <P> By Wendy Wasserstein <P> Where else would a baby boomer 's memoir play begin but at a high school sock hop ? The smartest girl in class sits alone , of course , equally terrified that no one will ask her to dance or that someone may . Where would the action predictably jump to next but a combined college mixer and " Clean for Gene " McCarthy rally ? What way stations are then more obligatory than a protest , a consciousness-rais ing session , a TV talk show and a mistrustfully viewed " ladies ' lunch " ? <P> As a portrait of a generation , Wendy Wasserstein 's new play is more documentary than drama , evoking fictionally all the right times and places but rarely attaining much thorny particularity about the people who inhabit them . The plot , such as it is , often seems like an unconscious cartoon of feminist dialectic . Two men stay close to the title character through the years : a pediatrician who is handsome , earnest , dedicated , kind , politically correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heterosexual who is grasping , impatient , domineering , shallow , as undependable as quicksilver and , for Heidi , sexually irresistible . This is the there-are-no-men lament reduced to a greeting card . The saving grace is Joan Allen in the title role . Winner of a Tony Award last year in Burn This , Allen becomes a strong contender to repeat with a performance that displays much the same virtues : an inviting vulnerability , an approach to romance simultaneously fragile and fearless , a wit at once acerbic and diffident . While Wasserstein ( Is n't It Romantic ? ) has written mostly whiny and self-congratulatory cliches for the surrounding characters , she has given Heidi  --  or Allen has found  --  a complex , self-aware and poignant life .
