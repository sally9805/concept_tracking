What is inflation ? What causes a budget deficit ? Many adults know the answers all too well , but most high school students have no idea . So says a survey released last week by the New York-based Joint Council on Economic Education , which found that only one out of three high school students in its 41-state poll could define such basic concepts as profit and the law of supply and demand . The 8,205 eleventh- and twelfth-graders who took the 40-minute multiple-choice test correctly answered less than 40% of the 46 questions . Declared William Walstad , a co-author of the study : " Our schools are producing a nation of economic illiterates . " <P> Though some of the questions dealt with difficult concepts or called for subjective judgments , the results showed that many high schools are failing to get even the basics across . Only 16 states insist that all students take an economics course to graduate .
