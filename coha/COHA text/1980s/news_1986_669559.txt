There ' s hardly a trace of the hippie culture that flowered in psychedelic bloom in the summer of 1967 , when young people from all across America trekked here in the name of peace , free love , and hallucinogenic drugs. // Today , this once run-down Victorian neighborhood is a model of gentrified chic - lined with restored gingerbread houses , arty cafes , and funky boutiques. // But there is one place on a quiet residential block just off Haight Street that has endured through it all : the Haight Ashbury Free Medical Clinic . Whether it was ' ' talking down ' ' kids on bad LSD trips 20 years ago or counseling cocaine abusers today , the clinic ' s drug-treatment program has run on an unchanging philosophy : Help whoever shows up at the door , even if a person can not pay one dime toward covering the treatment. // // It ' s a concept that set the clinic apart when it first opened , and it ' s one that continues to hold special relevance , especially today as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , is coming into focus as the nation wages its war on drugs. // ' ' One of the things that ' s become real clear is that this has become a class issue , so that those who have , get the ultimate ( in treatment ) , and those who don ' t have , don ' t get , ' ' says Dr. Margaret Gregory , medical director of the clinic ' s Drug Detoxification , Rehabilitation , and Aftercare Project. // ' ' Very often the person who ' s in the late stage of the disease is in the most need of . . . the intensive things , ' ' she continues . ' ' And because they ' re in the late stage , they have lost their jobs , they have lost their support systems , they have lost their money . Therefore they don ' t qualify for those kinds of treatments that are available to the employed , monied person. ' ' // The Haight Ashbury clinic is one of 5 , 900 programs across the United States that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and help provide services for people who can ' t afford private treatment , according to the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors. // The challenge for these programs , explains Nancy Record , the association ' s director of public policy , is that ' ' they ' re filled and they ' re putting people on waiting lists. ' ' // At the Haight Ashbury clinic alone , for example , some 600 people a month are treated by staff doctors and counselors . But every month 400 more people are placed on waiting lists because there is no room for them. // On the other hand , Ms. Record notes , ' ' if you have the ability to pay , there ' s always going to be some ( private program ) that ' ll take you . ' ' In fact , in the past decade there ' s been a boom in private , for-profit alcohol and drug-addiction treatment programs. // That growth is due in part to a need for treatment facilities , but also in large measure to the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance groups to define addiction as a disease , and therefore to include treatment costs as part of major health-care-benefit packages. // Generally , however , only costs for inpatient hospital programs are completely covered ; costs for nonhospital residential programs or outpatient treatment , such as visits to a private psychotherapist , are covered only in part , if at all. // Although numbers are hard to pin down ( private programs do not have to report to government agencies ) , the National Institute on Drug Abuse says there are more than 4 , 000 private programs in operation across the country . Costs can run as high as $5 , 000 or more per person for one week in such a program , and insurance companies often pick up the tab. // Some treatment professionals agree that some people find help in these high-priced hospital programs . But critics contend that the private , for-profit operations are all too often interested in making money . Many ex-addicts or their families have stories to tell about programs where patients were dropped after their insurance money ran out , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country club ' ' atmosphere , where patients are well fed and well cared for , but may be released without really being free from drugs. // ' ' You have to ask yourself , ' What ' s the commitment of a culture that is willing to pay all this money for people to go and essentially be entertained ? ' ' ' says Elaine Resnick , a clinical social worker and an expert on drug abuse. // Other critics even argue about how effective treatment programs really are . Craig Reinarman , a professor of sociology at Northeastern University and an expert on the history of drug abuse , says that although some people are helped through treatment , many users quit on their own . In fact , he says , ' ' there are probably more people who quit without treatment ' ' than those who quit as a result of treatment. // The whole treatment dilemma - who gets what treatment , who pays for it , what is effective - grows out of the fact that the addiction treatment field is still a relatively new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been somewhat ignored in recent years , especially under the Reagan administration , which , before announcing its war on drugs in September , had actually cut funds for drug and alcohol treatment research during the first six years of the President ' s tenure. // But Dr. Gregory of the Haight Ashbury clinic says she thinks her field is finally beginning to gain some legitimacy . ' ' At least I can get on the phone and talk to other people who are capable of recognizing an alcoholic , ' ' she says . ' ' There is more than one person out there . I can talk addiction disease and use the term and not get challenged. // ' ' I no longer get questioned as often as to why I like to work with these people , ' ' she says . ' ' I no longer have to feel apologetic for wanting to work in this field. ' ' // Just as it has for the past 20 years , the clinic runs on a policy of offering its services not only for free ( although donations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patients are not forced to give their names and are not lectured on their life styles. // ' ' The very first thing you have to do is establish yourself as a safe person that they can be with , ' ' says Carol Chapman , a substance-abuse counselor and director of internships and volunteers . ' ' Through the process of listening to them , they will begin to believe they can trust you and that you ' re OK , and that they feel good about coming into treatment. // ' ' Remember , we ' re on an outpatient basis where people come in voluntarily , ' ' she adds . ' ' After you have some basic trust things set up , then you can start helping with some decisionmaking skills and you can start setting some ground rules. ' ' // Although the clinic has seen a rise in cocaine abusers recently , Ms. Chapman describes the nature of drug abuse over the years by simply drawing a circle in the air with her finger. // ' ' It ' s just circular , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Right now it ' s fairly fashionable to talk about the stimulant abuse epidemic that ' s happening across the country . But it hasn ' t been too long since it was a downer epidemic of heroin. // ' ' The people sound the same , although maybe they look a little different , ' ' she continues . ' ' When a person comes in with a drug abuse problem you can sense the despair in their lives , you can sense the confusion , and you can sense the tragedy . Those are the things that you work with. . . // ' ' You really address the tragedy of what ' s happening in that person ' s life right now and how to help them make something different of their own lives . That crosses race , it crosses sex , it crosses economics . And it ' s the same.

' ' I think we ' re still underaddressing the severity of the two main legal drugs that we have . . . . I think we need to address addiction to everything. ' ' // For example , she adds , ' ' more and more states are legalizing lotteries . A facet of the mentality of today ' s society is that we don ' t have a clear , long-range look at what a lottery does . I ' m not going to say that lotteries are bad , or that everything pleasurable is addicting. // ' ' But , ' ' she insists , ' ' we don ' t look at the long-range impact of what we are doing in terms of creating a society that is addicted to a number of things.
