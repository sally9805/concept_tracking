Washington used to get a good chuckle from a gag about life in the White House with Dick and Pat Nixon . On a typical evening in the mansion , the phone rings and the caller asks the President what he is doing . Answers Nixon : " I 'm just sitting here reading the Constitution , and Pat is knitting an American flag . " <P> It is doubtful that Pat Nixon ever knit the flag , but the pervasive involvement of every modern President in interpreting the powers granted by the U.S. Constitution is now a hard and often bruising fact of life . If a President does not actually curl up by the fire at night to ponder his copy of the Constitution , in all likelihood he has read some of its phrases during the day and confronted its words in the rush of events . <P> Presidential leadership has always required the use of a good deal of energy in defining actual separation of powers and contending for rights at the boundaries of authority . When the nation was developing in abundance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great progressive surges of the people . Now , with society more crowded and complex , contention over the authority to act often cramps creative leadership . <P> " It is said that powers are separated to preserve liberties . But separation can also destroy liberties , " writes Louis Fisher , a specialist in American national government in the Library of Congress . " The framers of the American Constitution did not want a political system so fragmented in structure , so divided in authority , that Government could not function . " <P> The major arguments have always taken place between Congress and the White House , but now special interests also use the courts to nibble at Executive power . Environmentalists filed suit in 1971 to prevent Nixon from conducting an underground nuclear test on Alaska 's Amchitka Island . The Supreme Court ruled 4 to 3 in the President 's favor , but the battle left a bitter residue . Patrick Buchanan , then a White House aide , recalls asking Nixon what he would have done had the court gone against him . The President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it anyway . " That , perhaps , was a signal of troubles to come in Watergate , of Nixon 's dark impulses to force the system to bend to his will . <P> The media add another dimension to the struggle . Their questions about presidential actions , particularly in intelligence areas , frequently trigger a constitutional debate about power . No matter what the truth of the accusations , the man in the Oval Office must always take time out to answer them . The imperatives of media politics have required Chief Executives to yield more ground than they considered wise or necessary . <P> The size of today 's Government has become a problem in itself . There are 20,000 people now serving the Congress , virtually a separate government , which simply by political weight intrudes more and more into Executive matters . The White House , responding to that gauntlet , has 1,600 people on its roster . The thing they all do best these days is accuse one another and then argue .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
