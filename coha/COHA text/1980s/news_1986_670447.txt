Since the opening last Thursday night of the annual 10-day Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration , record numbers of people have filled the pennant-draped stadium at the center of town to cheer magnificent black stallions lifting their front legs as high as the railing while they move powerfully around the track. // But the big lick gait has also caused the Tennessee Walking Horse to become an equine pariah . Investigators with the American Horse Protection Association in Washington assert that the big lick gait can not be produced without using training methods that injure horses , including the use of caustic chemicals and heavy chains. // Major horse shows in California and other states bar walking horses from competition . And the American Horse Shows Association in New York has refused to recognize the breed . The critics , moreover , charge that owners and trainers are violating the Horse Protection Act of 1970 , a Federal law that was written specifically to outlaw certain training techniques . <> <> ' Big Lick Is a Corruption ' // " I ' ve been in the barns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horses ' ankles to make their feet sore , " said Maxie Decker , a former riding champion from nearby Franklin whose father helped establish the Tenessee Walking Horse as a registered breed in 1935 . " The big lick is a corruption . They ' re making these horses so sore , they can ' t put their front legs on the ground. " // In interviews , the industry ' s leading representatives acknowledged that some trainers still abused their animals to reduce the time needed to teach a horse the big lick . These officials , however , insist that the soring practice is not widespread . " I ' m not saying we don ' t have cheating , " said Benny Johnson , director of the industry ' s regulatory program . " But I don ' t think we ' re given enough credit for what we ' ve done to clean this industry up . And I don ' t think you should destroy an entire industry over the abuses of a few. " // Like other quintessentially American sports , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago became a very big business . The National Celebration was started in 1939 and it has made Shelbyville the center of Tennessee ' s $300 million to $400 million walking horse industry . In the last 10 days of August each summer the celebration attracts over 120 , 000 visitors , jamming motel rooms nearly all the way to Nashville 60 miles to the north and earning the area from $12 million to $18 million annually. // The celebration ends next Saturday night with the naming of the 1986 World Grand Champion stallion , a title that instantly raises a horse ' s value as a breeding stud. // Yet for years the celebration has been dogged by complaints of cruelty . Many owners and trainers think the criticism is unfair . And almost everybody else in town take the charges of mistreatment very personally . " The celebration is the biggest thing that happens in Bedford County , " said Max Peebles , a lawyer from the neighboring town of Pulaski .

Owners sought to add luster to the breed in the Depression by establishing an association for registry purposes and by organizing regional shows. // Still , when it was compared with other show horses , the stocky , broad-backed , gentle walking horse lacked a certain stylish presence . " We used to have shows with the Kentucky Saddle Horse , " said Dr. Bob Womack , author of " The Echo of Hoofbeats , " a history of the walking horse . " Next to them ours looked like plow horses . " Then came Merry Go Boy , a sleek , and stunning stallion with a high-prancing gait that captivated the judges , excited the crowds and earned the horse World Grand Champion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most horses walk by placing 65 percent of their weight on the front legs and rest on the rear legs . Merry Go Boy ' s trainer reversed the proportions by teaching the horse to lift his knees to the height of a man ' s chest and then to reach out with his hooves . To support the gait , Merry Go Boy gathered his hind legs beneath his belly , almost as though he was sitting like a dog . At a fast walk , the effect was startling . The big lick was born. // Not long after , trainers discovered they could produce the same championship gait in far less time by soring the front ankles and hooves of their horses with mustard oil , kerosene , acid , chains , nails and spiked objects . Horses limped onto the show tracks . Industry officials are determined to prove that walking horses are no longer being trained with soring techniques .

Last year , on the first night alone , one of five horses inspected was disqualified. // " Every year it gets a little better , " said Dr. James H. Duke , one of five Government veterinarians working at the celebration. ' // But critics say that many horses are still being mistreated . They say that trainers have adopted more advanced techniques for disguising sore legs. // " At one point , I thought they were really trying to do clean up their act , " said Susan West , director of investigations for the American Horse Protection Association . " But we saw horses stumbling around in the warm-up ring the other night . There ' s absolutely no reason for that unless they are sore. " //
