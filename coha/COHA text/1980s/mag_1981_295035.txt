America 's mass transit is a shambles , and no help is in sight <P> Nearly 30 million people ride subways , buses , trolleys or commuter trains every weekday in the U.S. Yet everywhere mass transit is either stalling or rumbling inexorably toward ruin . Items : <P> &gt; In Philadelphia last week , a bumper-to-bumper procession of cars , sometimes ten miles long , inched into the city while subways , buses and trolleys stood idle , sidelined by a strike of 5,000 transit workers , the fourth such in six years . Thousands of commuters from the city 's outskirts tried to get downtown via Conrail , but that overtaxed railroad line had to leave hundreds stranded on platforms . Some of the 400,000 Philadelphians who rely on public transit took to bicycles to get to work . The strike , sparked by union protests over the hiring of part-time help and a decision to require maintenance workers to pass proficiency tests , is costing the city $3 million a day in business and keeping 15% of schoolchildren at home . <P> <P> &gt; In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than three weeks because of insufficient funding . Some 30,000 riders have been affected , and the school system has signed a contract with the Yellow Cab Co. to provide transportation until the end of the school year . The only proposed solution to the shutdown : nearly halving the 43 routes to 22 and operating only from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. , weekdays , a 65% cutback in daily service . <P> &gt; In Chicago , the nation 's second largest transit system ( 1 million subway , el and bus passengers a day ) is going flat broke while the state legislature bickers over funding . Businesses and commuters are already reserving hotel rooms , forming car pools and making other contingency plans for a shutdown that could come as early as this week . <P> &gt; Boston , which closed down its entire transit system for 26 hours last December , has just enough money to operate its subways and buses ( 300,000 riders ) through the fall . City officials have already been forced to lay off 100 of its 6,700 transit workers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layoffs of an additional 220 employees . <P> &gt; In New York , whose transit system is the nation 's largest ( 5 million daily users ) and may also be its worst , already beleaguered straphangers were horrified to read headlines predicting a $1.55 fare by the summer of 1983 ( vs. 600 today and 300 in 1970 ) in return for steadily deteriorating service in graffiti-sprayed cars . <P> How did the U.S. transport itself into this mess ? Three groups contributed mightily : pusillanimous politicians who refused to risk their constituents ' wrath by asking for fare increases when they were unquestionably essential ; inept managers who , despite in many cases handsome salaries and generous expense accounts , proved incapable of managing ; and inflexible unions that pushed labor costs sky-high ( they account for 77% of Chicago 's operating expenses ) .
