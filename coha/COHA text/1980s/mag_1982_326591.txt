After Oklahoma and Georgia , it seems out for the count <P> <P> The matter before the Oklahoma senate last Tuesday afternoon : a motion to reconsider its earlier decision not to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution . As the roll call was taken , women in the packed galleries sat quietly . Then came the tally : 27 to 21 against . In the balcony a small group of ERA supporters chanted slogans and unfurled a yellow banner picturing a pioneer woman and carrying the words EQUALITY DENIED 1982 . Barely a day later , a similar scene unfolded in the Georgia house . The gallery was hushed as a red or green light flashed next to lawmakers ' names on the voting board . The final vote : 116 to 57 against . ERA backers stood and silently filed out . With those defeats in Oklahoma and Georgia , the proposed 27th Amendment to the Constitution may have lost its last hope for ratification . <P> It is unclear whether any other state will vote on , much less pass , the amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed 38 states have approved it so far , and five of these have tried to rescind their votes . ERA activists continue the fight , most strongly in Florida , Missouri and Illinois . In the latter state , supporters hope to force a rules change that would require only a simple majority rather than a three-fifths vote of the state legislature to approve a constitutional amendment . Pro-ERA forces waged a vigorous campaign in Oklahoma , where the amendment was thought to have the strongest chance for passage . Governor George Nigh and the leadership of both houses of the state legislature supported the measure . Pro-ERA groups ran radio , television and newspaper ads , took polls and organized door-to-door canvassing . The requisite celebrities ( Valerie Harper , Marlo Thomas , Phil Donahue , Alan Alda ) and politicians ( former Vice President Walter Mondale ) made appeals in person . Senators were bombarded with letters and phone calls , and streams of visitors turned up at their offices . <P> A major task was simply familiarizing the public with the amendment itself . The Daily Oklahoman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ERA by a slim margin . In the same poll , residents were asked their opinion of this unidentified passage : " Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex . " Eighty percent approved , many not knowing that they were endorsing the wording of the ERA . <P> Opponents rallied hard as well , deluging legislators with warnings that the ERA disturbed the " divine order " and had objectionable " consequences " : unisex toilets , abolition of the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts , homosexual marriages , a military draft for women . Their arguments evidently got a sympathetic hearing . Said Senator Norman Lamb : " I hope and pray that women , ladies and girls will not be dragged down to the level of men by the passage of the 27th Amendment . " The ERA 's broad constitutional language worked against it in the end . Said Darlene Ramming of Hinton , Okla. : " It does n't say enough . It 's like a blank check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
