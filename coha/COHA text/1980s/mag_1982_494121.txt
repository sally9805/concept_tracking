ENIGMAS OF POWER BY IRVING HOWE It is a common experience to fear that the admirations of one 's youth will wear thin , and precisely because 1984 had so enormous an impact on me when it first came out more than thirty years ago , I hesitated for a long time before returning to it . I can still remember the turbulent feelings ? the bottomless dismay , the sense of being undone ? with which many people first read Orwell 's book . My fear now was that it would seem a passing sensation of its moment or even , as some leftist critics have charged , a mere reflex of the cold war . But these fears were groundless . Having reread 1984 , I am convinced , more than ever , that it is a classic of our age . Whether it is also a classic for the ages is another question . What people of the future will think about Orwell 's book we can not know , nor can we say what it might mean to those who will remember so little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gloss if they chance upon a copy . But for us , children of this century , the relation to 1984 must he intimate , troubled , nerve-wracking . In 1938 or 1939 the idea of a world divided among a few totalitarian superpowers , which Orwell made into the premise of This essay will appear in " 1984 " Revisited , edited by Irving Howe , which will be published in August by Harper &; Row . Mr. Howe 's A Margin of Hope : An intellectual Autobiography , was recently published by Harcourt , Brace , Jovanovich. his book , had not seemed at all farfetched . I remember hushed conversations about the possible shape of a world dominated by Hitler and Stalin , with perhaps a shrinking enclave of democracy in North America . Such nightmare visions seemed entirely real during the years just before the war , and with sufficient reason . When Orwell published his book a decade later , in 1949 , one felt that , despite his obvious wish to unnerve us with an extreme version of the total state , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar , though in a somewhat different sense , was the body of detail about daily life in Oceania that Orwell built up . Many of the descriptive passages in 1984 were simply taken over , with a degree of stretching here and there , from Orwell 's earlier hooks or from his lifelong caustic observations of twentieth-century England . In a review for the London Times Literary Supplement Julian Symons keenly remarked that In some ways life in the Oceania of 1984 does not differ very much from the life we live now . The pannikin of pinkish-grey stew , the hunk of bread and cube of cheese , the mug of milkless Victory coffee with its saccharine tablet ? that is the kind of meal we may very well remember ; and the pleasures of recognition are roused , too , by the description of Victory gin ( reserved for the privileged ? the ' proles ' drink beer ) , which has ' a sickly oily smell , as of Chinese rice-spirit , ' and gives to those who drink it the sensation of being hit on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can generally view projections of the future with detachment because they seem to refer to people altogether unlike ourselves . By creating a world in which the ' proles ' still have their sentimental songs and their beer , and the privileged consume their Victory gin , Orwell involves us most skilfully and uncomfortably in his story .... Symons might have added that in Or-well 's earlier writing he had already focused almost obsessively on the gritty discomforts of urban life , the bad smells , the sour tastes , the grimy streets , the filthy rooms , the sweat-stained bodies . As it turned out , the un future of Oceania had some pretty keen resemblances to the immediate past of England . Resemblances , also , to the years of Stalinist terror in Russia . The grilling of Winston Smith by the Oceania authorities , the alternation between physical beatings and sympathetic conversations , the final terrifying appearance of O'Brien , master of power ? all these recall or parallel Arthur Koestler 's account in Darkness at Noon of how the N.K.V.D interrogated its victims . Koestler 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since learned about the methods of the Soviet secret police . It was to Orwell 's credit that he understood how the imagination flourishes when it is grounded in common reality . He knew , as well , that to make credible the part of his book that would spiral into the extraordinary , he had first to provide it with a strong foundation of the ordinary . Or to put it another way , he knew that his main problem was to make plausible ? which , one might remember , is not the same as probable ? his vision of how certain destructive tendencies of modern society could drive insanely forward , unbraked by sentiments of humaneness or prudence . Yet while rereading 1984 I have come to recognize still another way in which it all seems decidedly familiar ? hut this familiarity causes shock . T HE VERY IDEA of a totally con- trolled society in which a self-perpetuating elite rules through terror and ideology no longer strikes us as either a dim horror or a projection of the paranoid mind . In the few decades since Orwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of the total state , indeed , to the point where it now seems just one among a number of options concerning the way men live . The thought that totalitarianism is a constant , even commonplace possibility in the history of our time ? this may prove to be as terrifying as the prospect that we might sooner or later be living under an Orwellian regime . No sensible person could have taken 1984 as an actual prediction ; even those who read the book with malice or loathing knew it had to be taken as a warning , no doubt a fearful warning . That in its fundamental conception it should now seem so familiar , so plausible , is ? when you come to think of it a deeply unnerving fact about the time in which we live . But a fact it is . To ask what kind of book 1984 is may seem a strange , even pedantic question . After all , you might say , millions of people have read the book and appreciated it well enough without troubling their heads about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange nor pedantic , since in my experience there remains among Orwell 's readers a good portion of uncertainty and confusion about what he was trying to do . People will often say , " Look , we 're getting close to the year 1984 and we are n't living in the kind of society Orwell summoned ? does n't that mean he was exaggerating or even perhaps that he was morbid ? " To this kind of complaint there is a simple enough answer ; it 's in the very nature of anti-utopian fiction to project a degree of exaggeration , since without exaggeration the work would be no more than still another realistic portrait of totalitarian society . Other complaints , being more sophisticated , take on a " literary " edge . One of them , still often heard , is that the book contains no " real characters , " or that there is n't enough of a credible social setting , or that the psychological vision of the story is somewhat rudimentary . Such complaints have really to do with genres or misunderstandings of genres ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orwell was writing and what could legitimately be expected from it . When a critic like Raymond Williams says that 1984 lacks " a substantial society and correspondingly substantial persons , " he is ( almost willfully , one suspects ) missing the point . For the very premise of anti-utopian fiction is that it sketch an " inconceivable " world in such a way as to force us , provisionally , to credit its conceivability ; that it project a world in which categories like " substantial society . substantial persons " have largely been suppressed or rendered obsolete . In actuality a society like that of Oceania may be impossible to realize , but that is not at issue here . A writer may , in the kind of fiction Orwell was composing , draw the shadows of " the impossible " as if they were real possibilities ? if only in order to persuade us that finally these are not possible . As it happens , we have come close enough during the last half-century to a society like Oceania for the prospect of its realization to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a writer of fiction needs . There are kinds of fictions that should not really be called novels at all : think of Voltaire 's Candide , Swift 's Gulliver 's Travels , Peacock 's Crotchet Castle . Northrop Frye , hoping , probably in vain , to check the modern tendency to lump all fictions as novels , describes a kind of fiction he calls Menippean satire , " allegedly invented by a Greek cynic named Menippus . " This fiction " deals less with people as such than with mental attitudes ... and differs from the novel in its characterization , which is stylized rather than naturalistic .... " A quarter of a century ago , when first writing about 1984 , I thought this a satisfactory description of the kind of book Orwell had composed ; but now I would like to modify that opinion . Almost everyone has recognized how brilliant Orwell was in finding symbolic vehicles and dramatic instances through which to render the " mental attitudes " about which Frye speaks . Think only of Newspeak and Big Brother , Hate Week and Memory Hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as vividfigures . ( A few years ago I visited a Canadian university where the wicked students had baptized a new campus building ? vast , windowless , cement-ugly ? as the Ministry of Love ; and so , I am certain , it will be called for decades to come . ) There remains , then , good reason to see 1984 as an instance of " Menippean satire " ? but only in part . For in going hack to the hook I have learned to appreciate parts that now strike me as novelistic in the usual sense . Especially those parts in which Winston Smith and Julia try to find for themselves a patch , a corner where they can be alone and make love . Here bits of individuality begin to make themselves felt : Julia 's boldness , for instance , in arranging their escapade to the country , where they can be free of the hated telescreen , or her charming indifference to all ideologies , as when she falls asleep during Winston 's excited reading from the forbidden book , Emanuel Goldstein 's Theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1984 ought to be read as a mixture of genres , mostly Menippean satire and conventional novel , but also bits of tract and a few touches of transposed romance . Such a description may be helpful , though not because anyone is foolish enough to want exact categories ; it may train us , at the least , to avoid false expectations when we read . A l ANTI-UTOPIAN fiction must have a touch or two of excess . There has to be a story that takes the familiar conventions of the once-fashionable utopian novel and stands them on their heads . Elsewhere I 've described that touch of excess as the dramatic strategy and narrative psychology of ' one more step " ... one step beyond our known reality ? not so much a picture of modern totalitarianism as an extension , by lust one and no more than one step , of the essential pattern of the total state . But this excess can of course consist of more than one step , it might be two or three ? yet not many more than two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader might be broken by a piling-on of improbabilities . What has especially struck me in rereading 1984 is that , yes , it 's true that in an anti-utopian fiction the writer can afford at most a few steps beyond our known reality , but he is likely to achieve his strongest effects precisely at the moment when the balance teeters between minimal credence and plummeting disbelief . For at such a moment , we ask ourselves , can things really go this far ? , and it is then that our deepest anxieties are aroused . Is it conceivable that the total state could he so " total , " could break and transform human beings so far beyond what " human nature " may be expected to endure ? We think and hope not , but we can not he certain . We know that the total state has already done things earlier generations would have supposed to be impossible . One such moment occurs in 1984 when Orwell turns to sexuality in Oceania . Members of the Outer Party ? we remain in the dark about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimize and deny the sexual instinct , certainly to separate the act of intercourse from sensual pleasure or imaginative play . There can be no " free space " in the lives of the Outer Party faithful , nothing that remains beyond the command of the state . Sexual energy is to be transformed into political violence and personal hysteria . The proles are permitted to drift into promiscuity , their very sloth and sleaziness a seeming guarantee against rebellion , but members of the Outer Party caught in promiscuous relations with one another face the most stringent penalties . About all this Orwell is very careful : " The aim of the Party was not merely to prevent men and women from forming loyalties which it might not he able to control . Its real , undeclared purpose was to remove all pleasure from the sexual act . Not love so much as eroticism was the enemy , inside marriage as well as outside .... Sexual intercourse was to he looked upon as a slightly disgusting minor operation .... The Party was trying to kill the sex instinct or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dirty it .... " It remains a fascinating question whether Orwell had captured here anessential part of the totalitarian outlook or had gone too far beyond " one more step . " We know that in the years of Stalinism the Soviet Union favored , at least publicly , a prudish , sometimes a repressive antisexuality . But there is no evidence that during those years ? and this is the period upon which Orwell drew for his book ? Communist Party members were forced to suffer greater sexual repressiveness than the rest of the population . If the evidence is skimpy , Orwell was nonetheless touching on something very important ; he was taking an imaginative leap from totalitarian " first principles " concerning , not so much sex , certainly not sex in its own right but the threat of " free space , " that margin of personal autonomy that even in the worst moments of Stalinism and Hitlerism some people still wanted to protect . And it was this margin that Orwell took to be the single great " flaw " of all previous efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total " totalitarianism is possible , or possible for any length of time , is not , I want to repeat , the question . All that matters , for our purposes , is that it be plausible enough to allow a fictional representation . Winston Smith 's journey from rebellion to breakdown is a doomed effort to recover the idea , perhaps even more than the experience , of a personal self ; to regain the possibility of individual psychology and the memory of free introspection . And this occurs in 1984-1 think it is one of Orwell 's greatest strokes ! ? not so much through ratiocination as through an encounter between two bodies . When Winston Smith and Julia make their first escapade out of London , carefully finding a patch in the woods where they can make love , they are not " in love , " at least not yet . What happens between them is onlyonly ! ? the meeting of two eager bodies , animal-like if you must , but wonderfully urgent , alive , and good . They are free from the grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this and a few other sections Orwell writes with a kind of grieving , muted lyricism , a hoarse lyricism that is about as much as , under the circumstances , he can allow himself . I have found myself moved , far more than when I first read the hook , by these brief and abashed celebrations of the body . A little freer in our language than in 1949 , we would now say that Julia is a woman who likes to fuck , and it seems important to put it exactly that way , since in the wretched precincts of Oceania just about the best that anyone can do is fucking . Bolder still than Orwell 's strategy of " one more step " in treating sexuality is his treatment of power . He tends to see the lust for power as a root experience , something that need not or can not be explained in terms other than itself , and here too , I think , the passage of time has largely confirmed his intuitions . Let me draw upon your patience for a minute as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon after 1984 came out . Philip Rahv , in a fine essay-review of the book , said that in one respect Orwell may have surpassed even Dostoevsky in grasping " the dialectic of power . " The Brothers Karantazov shows the Grand Inquisitor as a tyrant ruling from benevolent intent : he believes man to he a weak creature who needs the lash for his own good and can he happy only when the burden of freedom is lifted from his hack . During the interrogation conducted by O'Brien , Winston Smith , hoping to appease his tormentor , repeats the Grand Inquisitor 's rationale for the holding of power : That the Party did not seek power for its own ends , but only for the good of the majority . That it sought power because men in the mass were frail , cowardly creatures who could not endure liberty or face the truth .... That the choice for mankind lay between freedom and happiness , and that , for the great hulk of mankind , happiness was better . That the Party was the eternal guardian of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , sacrificing its own happiness to that of others . All of this strikes O'Brien as mere cant , he scorns it as " stupid . " Turning up the dial of the machine that regulates Winston Smith 's pain , he chastizes him in these memorable words : The Party seeks power for its own sake . We are not interested in the good of others ; we are interested solely in power .... One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution ; one makes a revolution in order to establish a dictatorship . The object of persecution is persecution . The object of torture is torture . The object of power is power .... Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation . Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing . This exchange forms a key passage in 1984 , perhaps in the entirety of modern political discourse . Commenting on it , Philip Rahv offered a criticism in 1949 that seemed to me at the time both shrewd and valid : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Dostoevsky 's insight strikes me as being more viable than Or well 's strict realism . It seems to me that Orwell fails to distinguish , in the behavior of O'Brien , between psychological and objective truth . Undoubtedly it is O'Brien , rather than Dostoevsky 's Grand Inquisitor , who reveals the real nature of total power ; yet that does not settle the question of O'Brien 's personal psychology , that is , of his ability to live with this naked truth as his sole support ; nor is it conceivable that the party elite to which he belongs could live with this truth for very long . Evil , far more than good , is in need of the pseudo-religious justifications so readily provided by the ideologies of world-salvation and compulsory happiness .... Power is its own end , to he sure . but even the Grand Inquisitors are compelled ... to believe in the fiction that their power is a means to some other end , gratifyingly noble and supernal . Several decades have passed since Rahv wrote these trenchant lines and most of what has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely correct . Orwell was writing at a time when Stalin was alive and Hitler only recently dead : totalitarianism seemed an overpowering force , perhaps on the verge of taking Europe . The ideological fanaticism that a few years later would strike Hannah Arendt as one of the two underpinnings of the total state , was still strong . For while it is true that Hitler and Stalin ruled through terror , it is also true that there were millions of people who took the Nazi and Communist ideologies , myths , and slogans with the utmost seriousness , yielding to them a devotion far more intense than traditional religions have been able to elicit in this century . Power may indeed he the beginning and the end of Party rule in Oceania , but at least in 1949 and for some years afterward it seemed hard to believe that an O'Brien would or could speak as openly as Orwell had him do , even to a victim he was soon to break . C AN WE NOW he so certain that Orwell was wrong in giving O'Brien that speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived to witness a remarkable development of the Communist state : its ideology has decayed , far fewer people give credence to its claims than in the past , yet its power remains virtually unchecked . True , there is a less open use of terror , but the power of the state ? a sort of terror-in-reserve re-mains a total power . As lethargy and sloth overtake the Communist societies , it begins to seem that ideology will become among them a kind of fossilized body of tiresome and half-forgotten slogans . Not many educated Russians , including those highly placed within the Party , can be supposed still to " believe " they are building the Communist society first expounded by Marx and Lenin . But the Party remains . What then do the apparatchiks believe in ? They believe in their apparatus . They believe in the Party . They believe in the power these enable . That a high Soviet bureaucrat might now talk to an imprisoned dissident in the bluntly cynical style that O'Brien employs in talking to Winston Smith does not therefore seem inconceivable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially if he is intelligent and has some pretensions to being sophisticated , might like to show his victim that he knows perfectly well that the totalitarian ethos has begun to decay , indeed , has entered a phase of transparency in which its cloak of the ideal has been stripped away . Now , this bureaucrat might not he as lucid as O'Brien , but he could easily speak to his victim as if to say , Look here , my good fellow , I do n't want to make a fool of myself with all that big talk about the ' classless society , ' I simply want you to recognize , for your own good , who has the power and who intends to keep it . I take it as a sign of Orwell 's intuitive gifts that he should have foreseen this historical moment when belief in the total state is crumbling yet its power survives . Whether such a condition signifies an explosive crisis or a period of low-keyed stability , we do not yet know . But there is now at least some ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rulers of the total state no longer need trouble to delude themselves , perhaps because they no longer can , about their motives and claims . The grim possibility is that they now have a realistic view of themselves as creatures holding power simply for the sake of power , and that they find this quite sufficient . HE MOST PROBLEMATIC , but also interesting , aspect of 1984 is Orwell 's treatment of the proles . They were governed by private loyalties which they did not question . What mattered were individual relationships , and a completely helpless gesture , an embrace , a tear , a word spoken to a dying man , could have value in itself . The proles , it suddenly occurred to Winston Smith were not loyal to a party or a country or an idea , they were loyal to one another . With its echo of E. M. Forster , this is very touching , and it becomes more than touching when Winston Smith looks for some agency or lever of rebellion that might threaten the power of the Party . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notebook , " it lies in the proles .... " If ... and then the paradox that even in the half-forgotten era of capitalism used to bedevil socialists : " Until the proles become conscious they will never rebel , and until after they have rebelled they can not become conscious . " Orwell knew of course that traditionally Marxists had offered a " dialectical " resolution of this dilemma : the imperatives of action stir people into consciousness , and the stimulants of consciousness enable further action . A powerful formula , and millions of people have repeated it ; but like other left-wing intellectuals of his day , he had come to feel dubious about its accuracy or usefulness . In writing 1984 , however , Orwell was wise enough to leave slightly open the question of whether the proles could exert a decisive power in modern society . Here , if anywhere , Orwell made his one major error . The proles are allowed more privacy than Party members , the telescreen does not bawl instructions at them , and the secret police seldom trouble them , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What this must mean is that the Inner Party judges the proles to be completely crushed and tamed , no threat to its power either now or in the future , quite demoralized as individuals and helpless as a social class . UT THE EVIDENCE of history ? BU ought , after all , to be crucial for a writer of an anti-utopian fiction ? comes down strongly against Orwell 's vision of the future . Europe this past half-century has been convulsed by repeated , if unsuccessful , rebellions in which the workers ( or proles ) have played a major role , from East Berlin in 1956 to France in 1968 , from the Hungarian Revolution to the rise of Solidarity in Poland . But let us agree , for the sake of the argument , to move past the historical actuality or probability , since , after all , it 's always possible to read the evidence in conflicting ways . Suppose , instead , we focus only on the criterion of imaginative plausibility in forming a judgment about Orwell 's treatment of the proles . Even then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strained excessively . Let me take the liberty of quoting a few sentences I wrote soon after 1984 came out , because I think they are still pertinent : Orwell 's treatment of the proles can be questioned on ... fundamental grounds . The totalitarian state can afford no luxury , allow no exception ; it can not tolerate the existence of any group beyond the perimeter of its control ; it can never become so secure as to lapse into indifference . Scouring every corner of society for rebels it knows do not exist ! yet they might , they could ! l , the totalitarian state can not come to rest for any prolonged period of time . To do so would he to risk disintegration . It must always tend toward a condition of self-agitation , shaking and reshaking its members .... And since , as Winston Smith concludes , the proles remain one of the few possible sources of revolt , it can hardly seem plausible that Oceania would permit them even the relative freedom Orwell describes . If the " ruling circles " of Poland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they would tell him that , lucid as he may be on the subject of power , he may well he making a mistake in his view of the proles . N AURA OF GLOOM hangs over 1984 : the book ends with a broken Winston Smith drinking Victory Gin and blubbering his drunken love for Big Brother . He has made his " adjustment . " " If there is any hope , it lies with the proles , " Winston Smith had said ; but is there any hope ? That is not a question Orwell is obliged to answer ; he need only ask it , with sufficient honesty and the despair that shows him to be a man of his century . The gloom that hovers over the book has been " explained " by some critics as a symptom of the grave illness Orwell was suffering at the end of his life , at the very time he wrote his book . Perhaps there is a small measure of truth in this , but basically it seems to me a rather stupid idea . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surging inventiveness that shapes 1984 ? and , in any case , where have these critics kept themselves this past half-century ? Have n't they heard the had news ? No , the gloom of 1984 is real and justified ; but it is an energizing and passionate gloom . If the extremism of Orwell 's vision derives from a close responsiveness to the idea of a world in which human life is shorn of dynamic possibilities , it also reflects his growing distaste for politics itself , at least a politics that leaves no margin for anything but itself . And this may also account for the streak of conservatism in Orwell 's outlook ? a conservatism less of politics than of sensibility : that is , an appreciation for the way people actually live , the strengths of received ties and feelings . One of the most affecting bits in 1984 is Winston Smith 's recurrent effort to recall fragments of the past , the days before the Party took power . He tries to remember how his mother caressed him as a child , simply because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a destroyed church ; he tries to put together an old rhyme , trivial in itself but rich with associations : Oranges and lemons , say the bells of St. Clements , You owe me three farthings , say the bells of St. Martin 's . When will you pay me ? say the bells of Old Bailey . When I grow rich , say the bells of Shore-ditch . This conservatism of feeling , already present in Orwell 's earlier books , is taken by some readers to conflict with his democratic socialist convictions . That would be true only if socialism were seen ? so indeed both authoritarian left and reactionary right see it ? as a total expurgation of the past , an attempt by a bureaucratic elite to impose " utopia " through terror . Orwell understood , however , that democratic socialism is an effort to extend what is valid in the past , to enlarge our freedoms and deepen our culture . The conservative sentiments Orwell reveals in 1984 not only are n't in conflict with his socialist opinions , they can be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hopes . W HILE WRITING this essay I have been asked several times by an editor of an American magazine eager for a quick word : " if Orwell were still alive , would he have remained a socialist ? " The question is absurd , on the face of it , since no one can possibly know . But this much can be said : within his generation of left-wing writers and intellectuals , some have turned to the right , some have tried to refine their socialist values toward a greater stress on democracy , and others have abandoned their interest in politics entirely . Which of these directions Orwell might have taken it would be foolish to say , except that it 's hard to imagine him dropping his interest in politics entirely . We do know that Orwell publicly repudiated efforts to use 1984 as a piece of anti-socialist propaganda . A letter he wrote to an American correspondent puts his opinion with characteristic bluntness and lucidity : My recent novel 19841 is NOT intended as an attack on socialism or on the British Labour Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a show-up of the perversions to which a centralized economy is liable and which have already been realized in Cornmonism and fascism . I do not beiles.e that the kind of society I describe necessarily will arrive . but I believe ( allowing of course for the fact that the book is a satire ) that something resembling it could arrive .... This is simply Orwell 's opinion , and we know that writers often do n't grasp the full implications of their work . It is quite possible , therefore , for some readers to say that while Orwell did not intend his book to be an attack on the socialist idea , it can he read that way . And so it can . The vision of things Orwell presents need not necessarily lead to any one political conclusion , except a stress upon the urgency of democratic norms . Liberals , conservatives , and socialists can all argue from Orwell 's text in behalf of their views , though the more sophisticated among them will recognize that a political position must be justified in its own terms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a profound tendency within modern society toward economic collectivism ; that this tendency can take on a wide range of political colorations , from authoritarian to democratic ; and that it can be deflected or modulated but probably can not simply be annulled . The interpenetration of state and society , government and economy is simply a fact of modern life , quite as industrialization and urbanization have been . in 1940 Orwell wrote , " There is little question of avoiding collectivism . The only question is whether it is to be founded on willing cooperation or on the machine gun " ? that is , whether it will be democratic or authoritarian . This puts the matter with admirable precision . 1984 shows us what might happen if " the machine gun " triumphs , but the other choice remains to us.
