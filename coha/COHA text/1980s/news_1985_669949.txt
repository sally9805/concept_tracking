Women who have never given birth and who are using an intrauterine birth-control device face an increased risk of infertility , new research concludes . The research , in two studies , was especially critical of the Dalkon Shield , a plastic device that A.H. Robins Co. withdrew from the U.S. market in 1974 . The studies , both funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in the latest issue of the New England Journal of Medicine , found that the Dalkon Shield posed a three to 11 times greater risk of infertility . The studies are expected to provide additional ammunition for those who have sued A.H. Robins , the Richmond , Va. , pharmaceutical company that sold the Dalkon Shield for about three years . The company has been sued by about 12 , 000 women who claim that the product caused pelvic infections , involuntary abortions and infertility . The researchers found that users of plastic IUD devices , and in particular the Dalkon Shield , faced a greater risk of infertility . However , the two studies concluded that , for women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copper , the risk of being unable to conceive a child increases only slightly . For women who have borne at least one child , IUD use didn ' t pose any infertility risk at all , according to the studies . The new studies are the first to directly link IUD use to infertility . Earlier research has found that IUD use increases the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease , or infections that may damage the Fallopian tubes and cause infertility . One study , by the federal Centers for Disease Control , found the chances of such infections were highest among Dalkon Shield users . Sidney L. Mathew , a lawyer with a Tallahassee , Fla. , firm representing many Dalkon Shield plaintiffs , said the new research is likely to have " a significant impact " on pending suits against Robins , and to prompt more suits . Robins has settled about 8 , 300 cases at a cost of $314. 6 million and recently established a $615 million reserve to cover future claims . But Robins lawyers have claimed that the Dalkon Shield wasn ' t any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of currently available IUDs is lower than for the Dalkon Shield , the researchers said . One study found that use of the copper IUDs marketed by G.D. Searle &; Co. increased the risk of infertility 60% . The other study said the Searle IUDs caused " a statistically insignificant " increase . But the Lippes Loop and Saf-T-Coil , plastic devices that are less commonly used than copper , made the risk of infertility three times greater , both studies said . The Lippes Loop is sold by Johnson &; Johnson ' s Ortho unit . The Saf-T-Coil was sold by Schmid Laboratories Inc. , a closely held company based in Little Falls , N.J. Schmid stopped selling its device two years ago . All the manufacturers declined to comment on the new research results . IUDs are various-shaped pieces of plastic or copper that , when implanted in the uterus , prevent a fertilized egg from attaching itself to the uterine wall . Infections seem to result from bacteria that travel up the IUDs ' stringlike tails that are used for removal . Some researchers suggest that the Dalkon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , increasing the chance of bacteria traveling into the reproductive tract . One of the studies suggested that as many as 88 , 000 of the estimated 2. 75 million infertile couples may be infertile because of IUD use . Some surveys indicate that about 2. 2 million women , or 7% of those who use some form of contraception , rely on an IUD . IUD use has been sharply declining in recent years , and it currently ranks fourth in use  --  behind sterilization , birth-control pills and condoms  --  as a method of contraception . " The new studies shouldn ' t frighten women because they don ' t mean that all IUD users will become infertile , " said Daniel Cramer , a fertility specialist at Boston ' s Brigham and Women ' s Hospital who led 11 research teams in one of the studies . " It means that women who haven ' t had children and want them probably should use other methods of contraception , and that some of the products pose less of a risk than others . " One study was led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a University of Washington researcher . Both compared prior IUD use of women who had tried and failed to have children with that of new mothers . The Cramer study found that 89 women , or 31. 4% of the infertile women surveyed , used some type of IUD , while only 16. 7% , or 640 , of the fertile women used IUDs . The study found that 14 , or 5% , of the infertile women used the Dalkon Shield , while 53 , or 1. 4% , of the fertile women used the device . The Daling study found that 56 , or 35. 2% of the infertile women it surveyed , had used an IUD , compared with 22 , or 13. 8% , of the fertile women . Dalkon Shield users represented 14. 5% of all cases of infertility , while they represented only 2. 5% of fertile women . The two research projects , which cost the federal government about $2 million , also will study the relation of infertility and other forms of contraception .
