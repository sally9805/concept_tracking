From fire-breathing Huey Long to high-living Edwin Edwards , Louisiana 's populist Governors have almost always pushed at the boundaries of executive power . The latest to occupy the mansion , Democrat Charles ( " Buddy " ) Roemer , has quickly stretched those boundaries to all but a breaking point . Since he took over from Edwards in March , the scrawny Harvard-educated chief executive has extracted from the legislature budgetary and political power rivaling that $ once held by the dictatorial Kingfish . " I 'm the most powerful Governor in America , " exults the pragmatic populist as he flashes a baby-faced smile . <P> Unlike his predecessors , Roemer is using his new clout to dismantle the pattern of extravagant patronage and spending programs that made Louisiana seem as profligate as a Cajun on an old-time oil-patch payday . The Roemer Revolution is a drastic effort to restore solvency to a state that is , in Treasurer Mary Landrieu 's words , " flat broke . " In fact , it is worse than broke : it faces a deficit of $1.3 billion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil and energy revenues . Already , the tax-shy legislature has earmarked a 1 cents sales-tax increase , and may consider changing the sacred " homestead exemption , " which keeps property taxes low . <P> Although he is a diabetic who gives himself a shot of insulin twice a day , Roemer has been working 14-hour days seven days a week . He is trying to abolish 100 of the state 's 415 boards and commissions while cutting 16,000 people from the state 's 75,000-person payroll over four years . He is pressing for tighter environmental laws and increased spending for education , including a 5% pay raise for teachers . <P> Besides better fiscal management , Roemer is offering something else that Louisiana is not used to : relentless honesty in government . He has created his own muckraking department , hiring veteran Times-Picayune Investigative Reporter Bill Lynch to serve as Louisiana 's first inspector general . Lynch received enough reports of improprieties to prompt the Governor to replace all members of both the racing and the real estate commissions . Says Lynch , who is expanding his staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a reporter what I learned my first three days here , I could have won five Pulitzer Prizes . " Louisiana residents are encouraged to use a complaint hot line to phone in tips about waste or fraud in government  --  and so far , hundreds have called in . <P> Roemer has hardly escaped criticism . Labor and education leaders alike call him unapproachable . He has irritated teachers by suggesting that they face periodic competency reviews and surrender their system of lifelong tenure . Proposed cuts of $50 million in the state 's much admired charity hospital system have caused anxiety and protest in some localities . <P> Roemer has had his own moments of embarrassment  --  as when he was caught appointing the son of a key state senator custodian of notarial records in New Orleans , a part-time sinecure that paid its last beneficiary $105,000 . Well , said the Governor when asked about this venture in old-fashioned patronage , he would move to do away with that cushy job . Ed Hardin , president of Louisiana 's Common Cause , feels Roemer is much too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hardin : " He 's assembled power that makes Huey Long look like a piker. "
