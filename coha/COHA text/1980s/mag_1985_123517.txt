BAYLOR ( 3-1 ) //  --  // *On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as Louisiana Negro Normal and Industrial Institute in 1941 when 22-year-old Eddie Robinson accepted the job as its head coach for $63.75 a month . Now it 's called Grambling State University , and Robinson , the son of a sharecropper , has given it a national reputation . On Saturday , after Grambling had defeated Oregon State 23-6 , most of the 13,396 fans at Independence Stadium in Shreveport , La. roared onto the field as the team held its mentor aloft . " If you win a ball game , you win a ball game , " Robinson has said . " Do n't judge me as a black coach or a I-AA coach , but as an American football coach . " By that standard , Robinson had just won his 323rd game to tie the record Bear Bryant had set for career victories . Robinson will almost certainly break the mark this week , when his 3-0 Tigers take on Prairie View ( 1-4 ) in Dallas . // Tailback Lynn Williams and linebacker Dane Griffin , ruled academically ineligible by Kansas , went to court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got an injunction forcing the school to let them suit up against Florida State . " I 'm ready to play , but I feel like John DeLorean with all the legal pads and pencils and everything , " said Griffin , who was held out of the 24-20 loss to the Seminoles . Williams , though , rushed for 68 yards on 11 carries . Florida State , trailing 20-10 entering the fourth quarter , rallied behind third-string quarterback Chip Ferguson , who hooked up with fellow freshman Phillip Bryant on a 68-yard scoring bomb . Ferguson then moved the Seminoles 62 yards on four plays for the winning TD . // EAST For the first time in four games , Penn State scored more than three points in the second half . The Nittany Lions got 10 and needed them dearly in a 17-10 defeat of Rutgers . With his unbeaten Lions leading just 7-3 at halftime , coach Joe Paterno switched to a two-tight end power formation and inserted three ailing starters into the offensive line . The breakthrough came around left end with 3:15 to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TD . Penn State 's defense , which has given up just 63 points this season , was again impressive , particularly in holding Rutgers to a field goal after the Knights had first-and-goal on the five just before the half . " We thought we could jump on some people and make them think a little , " said Lion safety Ray Isom . " I think we knocked them around .... I know we knocked them around . " // SOUTHWEST // Inflammatory banners were few , fights were nil and an air of polite apology hung over Amon Carter Stadium as two neighboring Southwest Conference schools  --  SMU and TCU  --  battled for the edge in next year 's recruiting wars . Of course , it was recruiting that had sedated the normally charged , 70-year-old rivalry : Paying for players had put SMU on probation and forced TCU to suspend seven Horned Frogs . About the only thing bent out of shape was the sign in the booster parking lot marking space No. 121 . That belongs to Richard Lowe , one of the bagmen who admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 56-21 win , the Mustangs piled up a school-record 636 yards . The Pony Express backfield of Reggie Dupard and Jeff Atkins accounted for 321 of them , along with five TDs . The Frogs were forced to play 14 freshmen on defense . " The sun is going to come up tomorrow , " said TCU coach Jim Wacker . " Nobody died or anything like that . " // MIDWEST // Gerry Faust has a new condo in South Bend . Soon he may need to retain a real estate agent to unload it . Purdue toppled the Irish 35-17 , handing them their second loss in three starts . Boilermaker quarterback Jim Everett riddled the nation 's second-ranked secondary for 368 yards and three TDs on 27 of 49 passing . Notre Dame 's Steve Beuerlein could only muster 88 yards in the air , and Irish tailback Allen Pinkett gained a mere 45 yards on the ground . " We thought we could run against them , " said Faust , who may want to consult Virginia coach George Welsh about what color carpet Welsh might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work cut out for it . Following a disappointing 6-6 finish in 1984 , the Wolverines opened the season with three games against Top 20 teams . " I felt if we could win two of three it would have been a good start , " said coach Bo Schembechler . But powered by a defense that has yet to yield a touchdown , Michigan is 3-0 and playing perhaps the most solid football in the country . In a 20-0 victory over No. 10 Maryland , quarterback Jim Harbaugh completed 16 of 20 throws for 196 yards . // Big , bad Oklahoma  --  that 's 0-OU  --  finally debuted . At Minnesota , the Sooner offense controlled the ball for 41 minutes , racked up 254 yards rushing and  --  get this  --  did n't turn the ball over once in beating the Gophers 13-7 . Before the game , Sooner coach Barry Switzer and Minnesota coach Lou Holtz tried to keep each other in the dark by not exchanging game films . Holtz had figured he would get film of the Oklahoma-SMU game , which had been scheduled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please the powers at ABC . Holtz called Switzer 's office for a substitute but never got his film . Meanwhile Switzer tried to get a look at the Gophers ' Sept. 21 game against Montana , with Holtz trying to block that move by hoarding his footage . The yellow handkerchief , please . Offsetting personal fouls : holding clippings. // WEST // Arizona appeared to be making a move toward its first Pac-10 title , but a 14-13 nonconference loss to Colorado has left the Wildcats up a tree . The Buffaloes threw just four times but picked up 301 yards running , 100 of them by 4.3 speedster Ron Brown . Sure , wishbone teams like Colorado can be befuddling. but Arizona 's sluggish O , which gained just 228 yards , is harder to explain . // Arizona State , on the other hand , heightened its conference chances with a stunning 24-0 win over USC . With two shutouts in a row , the Sun Devils have surrendered an average of only 4.0 points a game , the lowest in the nation . A pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fulcher 's fumble recovery on the Sun Devil goal line with the score 7-0 in the second quarter set up a game-breaking 95-yard TD reception by Aaron Cox three plays later .
