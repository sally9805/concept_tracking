At about 10 o'clock on a moonless night , the grungy 2,215-ton ferry Dona Paz coursed through the choppy waters of the Tablas Strait , some 110 miles south of Manila . The people who crammed the decks on makeshift cots and slept three or four to a bed were scheduled to be in the capital by morning , and the air was filled with anticipation . Young women from the impoverished island of Samar talked excitedly about finding jobs as maids in Manila homes . Mothers and fathers tucked their children into bed and chatted about the relatives and the sights they would soon see . <P> Suddenly , without warning , the Victor , a Philippine tanker carrying 8,800 bbl. of petroleum products , collided with the Dona Paz . Immediately , the tanker 's cargo ignited , setting the sea aflame . As the inferno engulfed both ships , dozens of passengers leaped , diving deep to avoid the burning waters . Swimming beyond the fiery oil , Eugenio Orot , 27 , surfaced hundreds of feet away from the ferry . As the anguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and " Tatay ! " ( father ) echoed around him , he searched desperately for his two children and wife , but to no avail . Within four hours , the Dona Paz and the Victor were gone . <P> Ships in the area rescued 26 people from the shark-infested waters , but no more . It was the worst peacetime maritime disaster of the century , exceeding the record of the Titanic , which went down in 1912 with some 1,500 on board . The worst shipping calamity occurred during World War II , when a Soviet submarine torpedoed the Nazi transport Wilhelm Gustloff , killing an estimated 7,700 . While more than 1,600 people , including eleven crewmen from the Victor , were presumed dead in last week 's accident , the actual count was almost certainly higher . The names of as many as 1,000 children may not have been included on the ferry 's manifest . Passengers who purchased tickets after boarding also may not have been listed in the roster .

Less than 40 miles from where the Dona Paz went down , the ferry Don Juan collided with an oil tanker in 1980 . More than 100 drowned . Last week 's disaster may have been caused by navigational errors  --  or negligence . One survivor alleged that at the time of the collision the Dona Paz 's captain was watching a video in his bunk and the first and third mates were drinking beer , leaving an inexperienced apprentice in charge of the bridge . The catastrophe was all the more painful because of the approaching holidays . Calling the accident a " national tragedy of harrowing proportions , " President Corazon Aquino * ordered a full investigation and declared " strict sanctions must be imposed on all parties at fault . " Unless Aquino pushes for a stricter law , the punishment promises to be mild : the government 's Board of Marine Inquiry can levy fines of no more than $200.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
