ACT says the commercial creates " a misleading impression that there is a substantial amount of fruit present in or used in making the cereal. " // Craig Shulstad , a spokesman for General Mills , said ACT ' s charges are " completely without foundation . " " The commercial , in three separate instances , refers to the product as being fruit-flavored , " Mr. Shulstad said , " and the cereal , in fact , contains natural lemon and orange flavors. " // There is no real fruit in Trix . The Trix jingle says " there ' s lemon , there ' s orange in every bite . " The video portion of the commerical shows an orange and a lemon , and the peels of the fruits form the words " lemon " and " orange " as they dissolve into a bowl of Trix cereal. // The complaint says , in part , that the cereal commercial is deceptive and misleading because it is geared to children who have " limited perceptual and cognitive capabilities . " The children are told to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on nutritional information provided by the manufacturer , 35. 9 percent of the cereal is actually sugar . <> <> Italian Treats // Another day , another cheese . It doesn ' t seem possible that anyone could come up with one more that you really want to try . But Balducci ' s Taleggio a la crema , a mixture of their homemade mascarpone and Taleggio , is a sinfully rich , creamy delight that is perfect with fruit and wonderful with crackers and a drink if you are determined to ruin your appetite for dinner . Eating mascarpone is almost like spooning triple rich heavy cream . Combining it with Taleggio gives it a slight bite and character it does not have alone . A quarter-pound is $2. 75. // If you visit Balducci ' s , ask whether Grace Doria , one of the Balducci daughters , has made fettucine a la salmone , the artichoke pasta spaghettini with sun-dried tomatoes and smoked salmon. // The pasta is perfectly cooked - al dente . The flavor of the smoked salmon is there at exactly the right intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or canned . Just reheat it for dinner . The cost : $7. 98 a pound . <> Tempting Sweets // A few blocks west of Balducci ' s in Greenwich Village is the new Patisserie Lanciani . You can sit at a table in the bakery ' s new location - next-door to the old location - admire the Italian modern-Art Deco decor and sip an espresso with one ( or more ) of their irresistible sweets. // A few of the treats : chocolate mousse in chocolate cups ( $1. 75 each ) , the Paris-Brest ( $1 each ) , the kiwi tarts ( $1 each ) , and the Gateau Saranno , a cake filled with custard , laced with amaretto and generously studded with chopped pistachio nuts ( $10 for a six-inch cake ) . Some of the cookies , at $8 a pound , are just as tempting : the tuiles , langues de chat , almond spice , lace and nut. // Patisserie Lanciani is at 275 West Fourth Street . It ' s open every day but Monday ; hours are 8 A.M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 P.M. on Sunday . <> Tubercular Pork // The National Pork Producers Council recently asked the United States Department of Agriculture to permit the use of pork from pigs with tuberculosis in such products as hot dogs and bologna . Under current regulations such pork can be used only for canned products that must be cooked for 30 minutes at 170 degrees. // Despite the fact that the U.S.D.A. says the use of tubercular carcasses is safe , it is understood that the Agriculture Department has decided to withdraw the proposed changes in the regulation. // According to one Agriculture Department official , the Office of Managment and Budget was concerned about adverse public reaction . The unused meat is valued at between $3 million and $4 million a year , but the O.M.B. apparently believed the pork industry might lose even more money if people refused to buy bologna and hot dogs made with such pork . <> Mutiny From the Bounty // Even the old-time waiters at the reception were impressed when they surveyed the 7 , 000 shrimp in fish boats carved of ice , 4 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pickled herring in wine sauce , countless blintzes and mounds of chopped chicken liver. // " The food is very , very elaborate , " admitted one waiter , " the most elaborate I ' ve ever seen . " The National Fisheries Institute celebrated the opening of its 37th annual convention at the New York Hilton one night last week with its traditional president ' s reception . Each of the 1 , 900 guests had to pay $125 to get through the door. // For that price , they could choose from overflowing buffets of dim sum made by the Hee Seung Fung restaurant , known as H.S.F. , and a sushi bar manned by Take-Zushi . Or sample the food provided by the hotel : Lower East Side deli , Greenwich Village salads and Monte Cristo sandwiches and a seafood bar. // Unlike most reception guests who make a beeline for the bars , these conventioneers headed straight for the seafood display set out on a papier-mache wharf . They piled their plates high with oysters , clams , crab claws and shrimp and studied the mussels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The shrimp , on the other hand , tasted of iodine . Even the powerful seafood industry can not control that problem. // In the midst of all this splendor sat two pushcarts , peddling authentic pushcart hot dogs - steamed . Ten minutes into the reception , one " vendor " had served 50 or 60 hot dogs . " You mean with all this food around , people actually want hot dogs ? " asked one guest . The waiter behind the pushcart could not resist offering his opinion : " I think they ' re crazy . " But one hot-dog eater had another explanation . " I don ' t want to stand in line , " he said . " I hate crowds. " //
