calumny that because we address the political problems proper to our continent , we are therefore " Eurocentric " and concerned only with saving our own white skins . This overlooks , among other matters , the fact that quite a lot of European skins today are black and the fact ( which last year 's bombing of Libya reinforced ) that weapons systems , nuclear or conventional , deployed in Europe may as easily be unleashed toward Asia or Africa as against the purported foe . Now more than ever the East/West cold war crisis is an unnecessary and obsolete crisis , and the sooner we can overcome it , the sooner resources will be released to address problems of greater urgency . The European and North American peace movements can realize their objectives only as partners within a global shift to nonalignment in which the abnormal bipolar division of power gives way to poly-centric or plural diplomacies . For the rest , we would  --  and we do  --  emphasize even more strongly what was already expressed in our 1980 appeal : that our objective goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this weaponry  --  the cold war . As we stated in the appeal : " We offer no advantage to either NATO or the Warsaw alliance . Our objectives must be to free Europe from confrontation , to enforce d  --  tente between the United States and the Soviet Union , and , ultimately , to dissolve both great power alliances . " It is now even more evident than it was then that questions of what politicians euphemistically call " defense " can not usefully be addressed as if they are distinct from the political conditions of our existence . Indeed , as some actual progress in arms control becomes possible , so the political confrontation that underscores the weaponry becomes more visible , more intolerable and abnormal , and more accessible to our challenge . The cold war has engendered its own inertia and its own interests . But it has , increasingly , become an ideological psychodrama whose crises arise independently of any objective clash of interests between the blocs , and sometimes even of the internal domestic needs of the antagonists . In the past seven years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height of the Euromissile crisis , from 1981 to 1983 , we witnessed a reversion to the worst McCarthyite and Stalinist hostilities of the cold war . Once again rival ideologues tried to prescribe that one might be for either peace or freedom ; one could not be for both . Elements in the Communist apparatus sought to interfere in the affairs of the Western peace movements , while some Western politicians sought to turn " dissidents " in Communist countries into their fellow travelers . In fact , all this cold war psychodrama had an ulterior objective , which had very little to do with the supposed enemy . This was to discipline and control domestic opposition . It was successfully done  --  although not without great difficulty  --  and was registered in the West in a series of electoral victories in West Germany , Italy , Britain and the United States , and in the Spanish referendum on NATO . The psychodrama then entered a different phase . The antagonists relaxed ; new speechwriters were hired . To our considerable surprise , they broke into the peace movement 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of them as if they were their own . Of course we were not given any credit . We did not even get a percentage on the Grand Reykjavik Production , which plagiarized European Nuclear Disarmament 's appeal and the platform of the U.S. freeze movement but went further than us both , announcing the imminent abolition of all nuclear weapons from planet Earth . And we will not be given any credit this week , either . Very good , very fine . We do not mind if we are overlooked in the credits . We are not in this work for any kind of recognition or reward . We shall be very happy if the powers can get rid of all nuclear weapons without our help . We have other things on which we would like to spend our time . But until this week nothing has actually been done . To be fair , one thing was done : The Soviet Union , over a long period , sustained a unilateral moratorium on nuclear weapons testing , for which it deserves our congratulations . Just as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their total lack of response . But otherwise , until this week , nothing . The superpowers and their allies and clients have achieved less in any true peace process than has the tiny Pacific island of Palau and nuclear-free New Zealand . In this past year , the psychodrama has changed to a new and bewildering form . It sometimes seems as if the cold war has walked through a mirror . Antagonists change places or swap each other 's lines ; images are reversed . Communist economic reformers ( we are told ) admire the rigor of Western monetarists , while Margaret Thatcher  --  the Iron Lady and the inheritor of Churchill 's mantle  --  prepared for her general election by rushing over to the Soviet Union for a series of photo opportunities with Mikhail and Raisa Gorbachev . Mr. Gorbachev is awaited with an expectant hush in Central Europe as the agent of possible liberation from regimes once put in place by ? Soviet tanks ! President Reagan wanders inconsistently between one script and another , sometimes shouting insults across the Berlin Wall , sometimes , hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This script jumping and these dizzy reversals disclose that the cold war , as ideology , is now utterly exhausted of all realistic content . It is an inherited rhetoric that has persisted long after its historical moment has passed . It does not conform to people 's daily experience ; it is at odds with economic and cultural realities ; it has no meaning for the young . This signals that we are entering a time when the structures established after the end of World War II are beginning to crumble . The abnormal bipolar division of the world is now held in place by the unwieldy armories and the alliances laid down in the later 1940s  --  by these and by an exhausted ideological script written forty years ago . There is no possible human future in which one side or the other " wins " the cold war . We have come to the end of the cold war epoch , and the executors of the cold war will either destroy civilization in the attempt to cling to their own power and their ideological habits or they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapids of history , full of eddies and cross-currents , in which not one prescribed future but choices among different futures must be made . This is the world we entered , when the cold war went through the mirror . It is extraordinarily complex , extraordinarily challenging . The transition from one script to another  --  from global , bipolar confrontation through polycentric diplomacies to cooperation  --  will entail moments of heightened tension and impulses to collapse back into the old texts . There is going to be work enough for peace movements to do . The discourse of minds across national frontiers  --  and most of all across the security and ideological divide between the blocs  --  will be critical to any choices among possible futures . And this discourse can never happen if the minds are suspected of acting as servants of armed states . Our energies are already engaged in this , and we are heartened by the new flexibility and the new spaces for dialogue that appear to be opening in the Soviet Union . If there is to be a healing process or historical compromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest of historical transitions , far wider than anything even as widely based as the organized peace movement . We have to serve and facilitate a discourse that is larger than ourselves and in which trade and sport and music and art and a hundred activities all have their part . We must have the humility to acknowledge that a transition of this order can not be packaged in a single program , nor can it be organized according to correct doctrines . Finally , I have spoken about a possible future , after the end of the cold war . I must correct myself . For in the minds of living generations , and especially the young , the cold war has already passed . To be sure , the stereotypes formed in the Zhdanovite and McCarthyite zenith still throw their ghastly dusk upon the living mind and obscure the present view . But anyone alert to how young minds are moving within the Soviet Union or among its allies knows that they are not moving to that worn-out script any more than their counterparts are moving to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on both sides , beneath the thawing cold war snows . So , what we are working for is not some unprecedented change in human nature , some impractical utopian future . The world that we seek to realize is already here . It needs only the courage to throw off the shadows of the past , to show itself , to believe in its own existence . The ideologues offer to us a present that is already dead and that is dragging out a posthumous existence on the life-support system of militarism . Hui ' n consciousness has changed and we have helped to change it . This has redrawn and enlarged the limits of the politically possible . Everywhere , and on both sides . people know that a profound change is about to come . It if . cur business to disclose the present as it really is . E.P .
