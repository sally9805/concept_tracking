First of all , the marimba is not a dance , like the mambo . Nor is it a folk band , like a mariachi . Nor should it be confused with maracas , those hollow gourds filled with dry seeds that shake , rattle and roll south of the border . Most audiences could not pick it out of a percussion lineup , and concert managers flee at the very mention of its name . For Leigh Howard Stevens , to be the world 's greatest classical marimbist must sometimes seem a dubious achievement . <P> That , however , does not keep him from rhapsodizing about an instrument he describes as an overgrown version of the xylophone , nor from doggedly pursuing his lonely calling . The New Jersey-born Stevens , 34 , was first enchanted as a teenager by the distinctive sound of the marimba , the glowing , burnished , unpercussive tone that wafts from the four-plus-octave wooden instrument when it is struck with mallets . " I had never heard such a full and beautiful tone , " recalls Stevens , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do all the rhythm things , and I also had melody . " <P> Asian or African in origin , the marimba generally is played with one or two mallets in each hand , which are raised and then brought down sharply on the keys , called bars . Stevens has revolutionized the playing of the instrument , pioneering a complex four-mallet technique with a finger grip that allows him to execute broken chords , four-note harmonies and even separate melody and accompaniment by means of something he calls the " one-handed roll " : one hand plays two notes tremolo while the other picks out a tune . In his hands , the marimba has gone from being a useful but limited foot soldier in the percussion battery to a beguiling melodic instrument fully equal to the contrapuntal subtleties of Bach 's Two-Part Inventions . <P> On Stevens ' new Musicmasters album Bach on Marimba , a selection of the Inventions ( originally written for a keyboard instrument ) leap and dance crisply , while the chorale Christ lag in Todesbanden shimmers and glows . " With the xylophone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the marimba you hear the air column , a mellow , captivating sound that is rich in bass , like an organ . " <P> In the hermetic world of percussionists , Stevens has won renown for his innovation , which extends to the manufacture of mallets and the design of a new marimba . He is also struggling to create a repertory , which previously had consisted largely of transcriptions and arrangements . Stevens has performed more than 25 new works and commissioned an unaccompanied solo piece from John Corigliano . Slowly , the musical world is getting the message . In recent seasons , Stevens , a graduate of the Eastman School of Music who lives in Asbury Park , N.J. , has been booked for as many as 50 performances , and audience reception has been enthusiastic . Says Stevens : " I 'm doing everything I can to legitimize the marimba , get it respected and heard as a classical instrument . " Everything , that is , except the mambo.                @ @ @ @ @
