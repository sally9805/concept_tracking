The label of wunderkind can be a fearsome burden for any mere mortal . When Peter Sellars , 27 , was named director of the new American National Theater at Washington 's Kennedy Center last June , his appointment was greeted with both shock and greedy anticipation . This was , after all , the Harvard prodigy who had made his name with audacious updatings of Shakespeare , transplanted Handel 's opera Orlando to Cape Canaveral and spiced up Maxim Gorky 's 1904 play Summerfolk with songs by George Gershwin . Yet his first offering at Kennedy Center , a production of Shakespeare 's Henry IV , Part I directed by Timothy Mayer , was shocking only in its conventionality . So acute was the disappointment of critics and audiences that Sellars closed the play three weeks early . <P> But even wunderkinder can make false starts . For his second effort at Kennedy Center  --  and his first as director  --  Sellars has fashioned a dazzlingly original production of The Count of Monte Cristo . Exhuming this melodramatic war-horse , a stage version of Alexandre Dumas 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and toured in for 30 years , was just the first of Sellars ' bold choices . In program notes , he proclaims that " the evening contains at least five different plays , each with its own method and tone " ; cites influences as diverse as Bertolt Brecht and D.W. Griffith ; and even warns patrons that " there is no seat in the house from which the entire production can be seen . After all , this is n't television . " <P> No mistake there . Sellars has let his theatrical imagination run wild . The stage of the Eisenhower Theater , stripped to the pipes and rafters , is a cavernous expanse of catwalks , stairways , trapdoors and art deco modules that glide across the stage unloading and gobbling up performers . A string quartet provides onstage musical accompaniment , while the actors ( their faces often decorated with red or green war paint ) are showered with a hodgepodge of spotlight effects meant to simulate movie close-ups . Most of the 3 1/2 hours is played at fever-pitch intensity ; yet the climactic dueling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tones barely above a whisper . <P> Sellars ' furious improvisations are sometimes arbitrary and pretentious , and more than a little of the text sinks in the mire of expressionistic excess . But his reworking is so full of passion , inventiveness and sheer theatrical verve that one can not help cheering . Dumas 's tale of Edmond Dantes , a young - seaman in Napoleonic- era France who is unjustly imprisoned for 18 years and then escapes to seek revenge on those who wronged him , could have been a routine exercise in nostalgia or camp . But Sellars obviously sees grandeur in the play and is determined to make the audience see it too . If that means flinging in poetry from Byron , music from Beethoven or borrowings from the past 20 years of avant-garde theater , so be it . His stage effects are frequently apt and memorable . When Dantes is thrown into a dungeon , he and a grizzled fellow prisoner ( David Warrilow ) wail about their plight as their bodies sink beneath the stage . Soon only their heads are visible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image of existential despair .
