txt For most readers , Wednesday 's news story about the accidental shooting of 18-month-old Marcella Baker by her 12-year-old sister was a cause for sadness , anger , and frUstration . For those who happen to be devotees of guns , there was another reason for regret : . They knew that this utterly pointless death of a child would result in more boring talk about the need for handgun control . They also know , as do we , that no amount of talk ? or of similar deaths ? will change their views in the slightest . For them guns are the important thing , and having to put up with lectures about them now and then is a , price that gun-lovers willingly pay . Accidental shootings like Marcella 's happen every day . Her death happened to include all the classic elements . Her father , Melvin Baker , kept two guns in his South Side home for " proteetion . " Wednesday afternoon one of his five daughters got hold of her father 's .38 caliber revolver . Thinking she had emptied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trigger ; the bullet entered above the baby 's left eye and passed through her head . The father has been charged with possession of a stolen gun ; he says he bought it at the Maxwell street market and did n't know it had been stolen . This may be a tragedy , but it is not a novelty . Eleven days before , a 11/2-year-old Chicago girl , Limari Castro , was killed by a .357 magnum bought by a neighbor ; he was manipulating it when it went off . It happens all the time and will go on happening . Statistically , ' a given number ofhandguns will produce a predictable number of deaths ; the more readily accessible:guns are , the more they will be . Used , accidentally or intention- any , to snuff out lives . This fact is not exactly disputed by the gun fanatics . It is just not regarded as very important . What is regarded as important is " freedom , " : the ability of any citizen to own as many guns as he happens to want , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who dies because of this right is dying in a cause : their freedom to own , admire , caress , and shoot guns . In itself this hobby may be no more discreditable than a yen to collect , say , classic automobiles or bottle caps . But there is one big difference : No other collector requires that the law favor his hobby over other people 's lives . What the handgun hobbyist collects has the primary purpose of killing-human beings ; he must argue not just that his craving is respectable and somehow beneficial , but that it is government 's ? duty to protect it rather than protect people . Incredibly , the , argument keeps winning . Congressmen and legislators ? and Presidents ? i cave in to this insane argument as readily as spaghetti yields to a fork . By repeated decisions of our lawmakers , the right to shoot outweighs the right to live . Can anything be done ? That is not certain . But for people who think Marcella Baker 's life was more important than her father 's freedom to own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to get mad and stay mad until the law is changed in favor of lives over guns .
