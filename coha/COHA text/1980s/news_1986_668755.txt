Don ' t be put off by the bland title . " Entrepreneurs of the Old West " takes an intriguing new look at the westward expansion of the United States by examining in detail the roles played by businessmen , profit-seekers and speculators in that 19th Century national movement . This is a story about a silent army of capitalists , about their chase after the Almighty Dollar , and about how , through that chase , they faced and conquered ( or , more often , were conquered by ) the unforgiving West . " The heritage of the silent army , " writes David Dary , " appears today in the American notion that wealth and material possessions are essential for happiness , in the intense competition of Americans in business and other endeavors , in the mobility of Americans forever seeking better opportunities elsewhere , and in the conviction that money is indispensable to the enjoyment of the comforts of culture and , in turn , elevated social status . " But turning a profit in the West was no easy matter , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographs make evident . Take the far-from-unusual story of James Brown . In 1849 , he won a contract to freight merchandise from Missouri to Santa Fe . His train of 20 wagons got through after being stranded for five months by an early winter storm . A year later , under a contract to deliver 300 tons of government supplies to Santa Fe , Brown ' s wagons were again stalled by a snow storm , this time within 45 miles of his destination . Brown went ahead for help , but , in Santa Fe , he contracted an infectious skin disease and typhoid fever , and died . Some aspects of business apparently never change , however , such as the constant search for an edge . Most Western store owners eschewed advertising , but not Sanger Brothers in Dallas . In an attempt to gain an edge , the firm published handbills , and one from 1873 is , in a way , a McDonald ' s commercial of its time : " A WOMAN ' S DREAM " SHE SAT ALONE " In the moonlight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white and dimpled . You could tell as you looked at her that her thoughts were far away and that she was thinking of something beautiful . " Her eyes were wistful , the dimples in her cheeks had died out , and only the dimple in her chin remained , that little rosy cleft , the impress of Love ' s finger . She was less glowing at times , but nonetheless lovely . " I thought to myself as I looked at her that she was nearer to heaven than we coarser mortals , and I longed to know whither her pure heart turned itself . " I approached her ; she did not see me . I spoke ; she did not answer . I touched her softly on the arm ; she looked up and smiled a far-away smile , such as an angel might have given . " ' You are thinking very intently , ' I said . " She answered , ' Yes , I am thinking of SANGER BROS. who , owing to the Removal of their Stock and the LACK OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to reduce their stock at great sacrifice .
