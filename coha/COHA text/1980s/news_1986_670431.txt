Running for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate and a chance to challenge the Republican incumbent , Alfonse M. D ' Amato , Mr. Green uses language as one of his main weapons against his primary opponent , John S. Dyson , against the Reagan Administration and against the Senator. // On policies for the poor : " The Administration ' s and the Senator ' s heart couldn ' t pass through airport metal detectors without setting off alarms. " // On Mr. Dyson ' s insistence that they do not differ on the issues : " We ' re as much alike as a horse chestnut and a chestnut horse. " // On Mr. D ' Amato ' s budget votes : " You know how he claims to fill the potholes ? What he doesn ' t tell you is that he ' s the bomber who that morning created them by supporting cuts in Federal funds . " <> <> Author and Debater // Such language comes easily to the 41-year-old Mr. Green , who has made his living as an author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He hopes words will continue to serve him well in this campaign , making up for his relative lack of dollars. // Mr. Dyson , a 43-year-old businessman from Millbrook , in Dutchess County , has said he is prepared to spend as much as $6 million of his $30 million fortune in the primary and the general election against Mr. D ' Amato , who has an $8 million campaign fund. // Mr. Green has raised about $500 , 000 of the $750 , 000 he expects to spend in the primary campaign . He admits that raising money has been " like slogging through sand " and has been dogged at every turn by the view of some pragmatic party leaders , including the officially neutral Governor Cuomo , that a large campaign chest and deep pockets are necessary to win in November. // Undaunted , Mr. Green has made Mr. Dyson ' s wealth an issue , saying that his opponent runs an " elitist " campaign of expensive television advertising while he is out there conducting a " shoe-leather campaign " among the people and demanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dyson ' s " flirtations " with the Conservative Party over the years . Now , Mr. Green asserted , Mr. Dyson is trying to buy Democratic legitimacy . <> <> ' Cognitive Dissonance ' // " Some Democratic Party leaders in the state have cognitive dissonance on this point , " Mr. Green said in an interview , his boyish face framed by gray-brown hair . " They wake up in the morning supporting John Dyson because , although he doesn ' t excite them , he has the bucks . Then in the evening they go to bed bemoaning an Abe Hirschfeld whose money is giving them all sorts of problems and they just don ' t understand it. " // He said he fears a " wealth test " of sorts that would inadvertently make the Democratic Party " the party of the Hirschfelds , the Dysons and the Lew Lehrmans instead of the party of the Cuomos . " Mr. Hirschfeld is a wealthy developer who has been seeking the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor and Mr. Lehrman , whose fortune came from the Rite-Aid drugstore chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mario M. Cuomo in 1982. // It is Mr. Green ' s support from a number of the party ' s " major constituent groups , " including the National Women ' s Political Caucus , environmental groups such as the Sierra Club , unions such as District Council 37 and others - which Mr. Green believes " win primaries " for Democrats . And those same groups , he says , will turn out in the general election for a candidate who excites them and stresses their issues. // Mr. Green said Mr. Dyson , with a background mostly in state government , does not have the experience that he has with national policy debates and Democratic views on matters ranging from disarmament to campaign financing . <> <> ' A Whole New Script ' // " He has to learn a whole new script , " Mr. Green said of Mr. Dyson . " He sometimes knows the words , but he doesn ' t know the music. " // Mr. Green ' s combative style has dismayed party officials who at the start of the campaign pleaded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to focus their attacks on Senator D ' Amato . But he and his campaign advisers have not let up and they maintain that there have been tactical dividends. // For example , said Randy Daniels , an adviser , when Mr. Green attacked Mr. Dyson for having stock in companies doing business in South Africa , the Green advisers believe that he held at bay some party officials around the state who privately favored Mr. Dyson and were wanted to end their public neutrality to aid his candidacy. // Nevertheless , Mr. Green has vowed to support Mr. Dyson should he win the nomination because it is " preferable to have even a nominal Democrat " in the new Senate . But he is quick to point out that he can not say as much for his opponent , who has the Liberal Party line and has vowed a vigorous campaign that could split the opposition to Mr. D ' Amato . <> <> Helped Shape Legislation // Mr. Green ' s claim to having a national record rests primarily on his work as an aide to Mr. Nader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of the Nader-created consumer lobbying group , Congress Watch , which helps to shape legislation . He has also written or co-written a dozen books , including " Who Runs Congress ? " // A graduate of Cornell University and Harvard Law School , Mr. Green ran unsuccessfully for a Congressional seat from Manhattan in 1980 . He was born in Brooklyn and lives in Manhattan with his wife , Deni Frand , and their two children. // At times , he said , he worries about being pigeonholed as an old-fashioned liberal , but he added that he was " trying hard to blend my positions with fresh , new solutions , " approaches that are both " tough-minded and kindhearted. " // In addition to the attacks on Mr. Dyson , he has been circulating his " 50 New Solutions " as he campaigns . But only some are new and others are culled from small pilot programs that have worked or from the agendas of environmental groups and labor unions and the ideas of liberal Democratic lawmakers . <> <> ' Good for Starters ' // His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who do not know him know the name Nader and therefore warm to him . In Far Rockaway , Queens , last weekend , Mr. Green came upon Ann Keosayian from Brooklyn , who was lounging on the beach with friends. // " You ' re a consumer advocate and that ' s good for starters , " she said as she turned to tell her friends enthusiastically about a speech she had heard Mr. Green make once at a Brooklyn Democratic club . " Plus , I love the way you speak. " // But a few feet away , Birdie Race of Sunnyside , Queens , raised the specter that has hung over Mr. Green and other Democrats. // She said she felt " more comfortable " with Mr. Green than Mr. Dyson and would probably support him in the primary because of " the mood of the moment. " // " But , " she added , " I ' m more of a hawk than a dove and I like Reagan and Al D ' Amato. " //         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
