Cambridge voters , who go to the polls Tuesday to decide if the city should be allowed to soften the effects of Proposition 2 1/2 , were thrown a curve last week when some new numbers were added to the equation by the state . The ballot Tuesday will contain only two questions : - Will the city bypass the $10.2 million cut in next year ' s budget called for by Proposition 2 1/2 . - Will the citymake half that cut , lowering its budget by $5.1 million ? For the last two months a coalition of parents and concerned citizens has been lobbying heavily for passage of the questions , claiming that without approval of the override cuts in school programs and services would be devastating . But last week the King administration released its proposed fiscal 1983 local aid figures . Under that formula Cambridge would receive two-thirds of the projected cutbacks under 2 1/2 , or $6.8 million in increased state aid . The announcement caused consternation among the pro-referendum forces , and some spokesmen claimed that Gov . Edward J. King timed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer point to the city plans to lay off 91 teachers and more than 50 each in Police and Fire Departments if the questions did not pass . And while the referendum is seen as a sure short-term cure - it applies only to fiscal 1983 starting July 1 - the promise of increased state aid is still far off . " Both the House and the Senate still have to pass the bill , " said City Manager Robert W. Healy who noted that there appears to be significant politcal opposition to it . And to confuse the issue further , officials point out that the state aid formula is based on a city ' s losses in tax revenue brought about by Proposition 2 1/2 . Therefore , if voters pass the referendum it could mean a reduction or a total loss of the additional state aid . Healy pointed out that if the second question on the referendum passes , the city ' s tax revenue losses would be zero - in effect , level funding . This would mean no increase in state aid . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue loss would be $5.1 million and state aid would increase $3.3 million . Thus , Healy said , there appear to be no simple answers . If the referendum fails , the city would still have to cut more than $6 million from its budget , taking into account increased state aid and higher fixed costs of running the city . If the first question on the referendum passes ( cutting $5.1 million from the budget ) , the city would still have to cut $4.6 million from next year ' s operating expenses , Healy said . If the second question passes , which would mean level funding , the city would have to cut only about $2.8 million next year , he said . The second questions requires a two-thirds vote for passage . City workers , police , firefighters and teachers are all looking forward to Tuesday anxiously . Many of them have been working on their own time lobbying for passage of both questions . Rena Leib , director of Coalition for Cambridge , a group coordinating most of the lobbying for the referendum , feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people have been calling , sounding confused about the state aid figures . We ' ve been emphasizing that Cambridge needs one year to buy time until we can get more equitable distribution and statewide tax reform , " she said .
