The self-construction of the Nevelson persona has as much to do with words as with Paisley scarves or triple-layered eyelashes . In memoirs , lectures and interviews , the artist has built up a sort of collage of comments-often repeated , but often to good effect-on art , life , love and other themes . A sampling : <P> On Indirection . Life is n't one straight line . Never . Most of us have to be transplanted , like a tree , before we blossom . <P> On Early Training . I do n't like cold weather , and I found the schools cold , so I selected art . I liked that room because it was so warm . Of course , I loved my teacher too . But it was only years later that I accepted the fact that I generated heat because I was so happy in that room . <P> On Love and Marriage . I think romance is great , and I think love affairs are marvelous , and I certainly think sex is here to stay , and I love it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as lovers , that 's fine . But the minute you get that $2 paper , a marriage license , that becomes a business-it 's a partnership . And not only that , it gives the mates the privilege of all barriers down , and for God 's sakes who can handle that ! It 's a lot of work and it 's not that interesting . I would n't marry God if he asked me . <P> On the Appeal of Black . It is the most beautiful color . It really is . You take , for instance , any material , and when you convert it into black-I do n't even mean wood or a sculpture , I mean anything , for instance , a house-it 's so distinguished . <P> On Advising Younger Artists . I only know this-you ca n't give advice to an artist . Could I tell Caruso that he 's got to sing or that he 's got to take lessons ? Caruso was born with a voice . Then of course he cultivated it . Without equipment you can give advice until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that feel-and they have a right to fulfill that-that they want to give their life to what they are doing , I say , sure , go to work , just work , and the work will invite you to move . <P> On Having Children . I think people should think a million times before they give birth . The guilts of motherhood were the worst guilts in the world for me . They were really insurmountable . You see , you are depriving another human being of so many things , and the other party also knows it . <P> On Independence . It 's a hell of a thing to be born , and if you 're born , you 're at least entitled to yourself . <P> On Reality . It 's through the looking glass , dear . Always through the looking glass . Because I do not give the so-called material world its concept of reality . It 's through the looking glass that is the reality . <P> On Anger . Anger has given me great strength . I have a fantasy about Picasso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd delivered to him , hours before , a thousand glasses , and he 'd take a wall and smash them before he 'd ever start working . <P> On Moral Obligation . If you do n't live up to your greatest potential , then you are cheating God .
