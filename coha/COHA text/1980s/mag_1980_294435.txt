The Kemeny commission that investigated Three Mile Island for President Carter put only small blame on the operators in the control room on the day of the near disaster . Instead , the commission took aim at what it called the " shallow , " " deficient " and " inadequate " operator training system created by industry and Government . In the year since the accident , industry executives and Government regulators have made a number of changes . Says Loring Mills , a spokesman for the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations : " Before T.M.I. , the industry was training people to run plants as if they always ran correctly . Now we throw trainees situations they did n't anticipate and expect them to respond . " <P> Among the safety moves : <P> Creating Supernukes . Under new Nuclear Regulatory Commission rules , utilities are permanently assigning an additional expert to each shift to serve as technical adviser or supernuke , in operator lingo . The adviser is supposed to be kept free of all routine duties so that he can monitor safety indicators and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nuclear training supervisor for Commonwealth Edison in Illinois : " The objective is for the adviser to be so well rounded he ca n't be snowed by anybody in the plant . " <P> Rehearsing Snafus . Before T.M.I. , operators practiced handling emergencies on computer-driven simulators , but the training concentrated on one mishap at a time . At T.M.I. , problems occurred in rapid succession : pumps quit , a valve <P> PIERCE stuck open , and some steam generators boiled dry within minutes . Today , operators drill to handle multiple failures , and all 2,500 licensed reactor operators in the U.S. have gone through the sequence that occurred at T.M.I. In Soddy-Daisy , Term. , an annual two-week refresher course covering multiple breakdowns is offered by the Tennessee Valley Authority . <P> Emphasizing Theory . The Kemeny commission found that training did not pay enough attention to the theory of how the system worked . One mistake of the T.M.I , operators , for example , was their failure to realize that hot water in the reactor core boiled into steam because of the loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're planning to add much more study of the basic theory of heat transfer , fluid flow , water and steam theory-all the stuff the operators flew right by before and which normal operating conditions do n't require . " <P> Improving Warnings . Says former Kemeny Commissioner Thomas Pigford : <P> " The thing that bothered us more than anything else was that there were advance indications that this accident could happen , and they were ignored . " Indeed a similar event began in 1977 in Toledo Edison 's Davis-Besse 1 plant , and operators mistakenly cut off the operation of automatic emergency cooling pumps , just as they did at T.M.I. But at Davis-Besse the mistake was detected in time , and the reactor was quickly brought back to normal .
