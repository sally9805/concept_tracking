The general feeling was that winning in the House on Wednesday will not immediately change much , but that losing would have . After the House vote , the prospects for Senate approval of the aid appeared good . <> <> What a Loss Would Mean // A loss in the House might well have crippled Mr. Reagan ' s anti-Sandinista cause and seriously damaged his power in Washington. // " Had we lost , it would have been not only a defeat for the President , but as a practical matter it would have doomed the contras and put the Central American democracies in a terrible position , " said Representative Robert J. Lagomarsino of California , the senior Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs. // " Passage doesn ' t guarantee anything , it just provides a chance for the problems to be solved , " he added . <> <> Setbacks Are Avoided // Such were the stakes when the House approved , 221 to 209 , the Administration ' s request for $70 million in military aid and $30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate agreed to a similar package in March . The House had previously voted the measure down. // With much to risk , Mr. Reagan was seen as having staved off serious setbacks , and possibly even come out ahead , on four counts. // First , officials said , losing would have virtually condemned the contras to further decline . Winning keeps them afloat . But even Administration officials do not say it will turn the tide . To them , the war in Nicaragua is a long-term enterprise. // Second , a defeat would have undercut the Administration ' s bargaining position in the Central American negotiations . Winning is likely to stiffen the resolve of countries such as Guatemala , Honduras and Costa Rica against giving much away to the Sandinista Government in Nicaragua. // Third , a loss would have cast serious doubt on Mr. Reagan ' s dominance in the making of foreign policy . The victory showed that if he made an all-out effort , he could still get Congress to go his way . Winning also dampens talk about his being a lame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical number of House Democrats were no longer prepared to back the President on a crucial foreign policy question . Winning demonstrated that Mr. Reagan could still count on a sizable number of Democrats to bail him out in the Democratic-controlled House . <> <> Strong in the South // In particular , the vote showed that Mr. Reagan ' s position was still strong among Southern Democrats . Of the 51 Democrats who crossed the line to vote with him , 37 were from seven southern states . A solid majority of Democrats in Alabama , Forida , Georgia , Louisiana , Mississippi , Oklahoma and Texas backed him. // The contras have not received American military aid in about three years , although they have received arms from other sources . In the view of Administration experts , that is the main reason why the rebels have lost ground to the Sandinistas in the last year. // " At a minimum , the contras have not been nearly as active and aggressive this year compared to 1985 , " an Administration official said. // The feeling in the Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a profound , perhaps irreversible , effect on contra morale . Now the feeling is that the aid will , at most , allow the contras to make up some of their lost ground. // " The vote was a relatively inexpensive way , only $100 million , to prevent the contras from losing , not a vote to provide the resources and impetus to allow them to win , " Norman J. Ornstein , a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and Congressional expert , observed . <> <> Bolstering the Allies // But of equal concern to legislators and the Administration was the potential effect of a negative vote on Central American allies of the United States . " The feeling on the part of the Costa Rican , Hondurans and Guatemalans was that they were out on the edge taking the risks , uncertain of American support , and that the Sandinistas would make them pay for it , " Robert S. Leiken , senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , said. // " With the House vote for the contras , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicaragua in the negotiating process , " he continued , reflecting the general opinion of Administration officials as well. // Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin , chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and one of the few northern Democrats to vote with the President , said the negotiations were uppermost in his mind . " That ' s what the money was needed for , " he said . Many of Mr. Aspin ' s Democratic colleagues do not share his feeling that the Administation is seriously interested in the negotiations. // Reagan Administration officials said they felt that a no vote would probably have led to an unraveling of Honduran support for the contras and a much greater disposition in Central America to go along with the Sandinistas . " Now we feel that as a result of this vote the countries down there might see some stability in our policy and be less panicky about the negotiations , " one said. // But the vote also came at a time when Congress was generally challenging Mr. Reagan ' s authority to conduct foreign policy. // " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be saying that the President was in deep trouble on the Hill on foreign policy , " Mr. Aspin said . " Just look at the uproar here over his decision to abandon the SALT II Treaty , his South African policy , his arms sale to Saudi Arabia , and military spending requests. " // These were references to Congressional efforts to enact a law that would stop him from exceeding the numerical limits of the 1979 arms treaty , signed but unratified ; to legislate economic sanctions against South Africa ; to trim back on arms the Administration had proposed to sell to the Saudis , and to cut by about $25 million his requests for Pentagon spending. // With the exception of the Saudi sale , which has now gone through , Mr. Reagan still has to run the gantlet on these issues . But the feeling of Mr. Aspin , Mr. Lagomarsino and others is that he is now in a somewhat better position to do so. //                   @ @
