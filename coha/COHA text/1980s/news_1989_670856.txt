The taped conversations revealed that one board member and his campaign manager sought to control all hiring in the district . On other tapes , board members complained that too many blacks and Jews were being hired. // For years , bitterness has existed in District 27 , which encompasses 35 schools in an area including Ozone Park , Howard Beach , Breezy Point , Woodhaven and the Rockaways . More than half of the students in the district are black , but blacks said they have long had problems getting jobs and promotions in District 27 .

" Mr. Genn has 100 percent backing from the parents here. " // Susan Amlung , a spokeswoman for the the United Federation of Teachers , said the biggest concern for district teachers is that Mr. Genn will become so frustrated that he will leave . Before he took office , she said , teachers had " lots of grievances , morale was low , and there was little chance for their input. " // John Falco , principal of J.H.S. 210 , said the only consensus in his school is " the courage of the superintendent. " // " I just have a lot of concerns about decentralization , " he said . " I believe in decentralization , but there doesn ' t seem to be a good system of checks and balances. // " Are we saying that we can ' t find a way to elect officials so we can have a say in how we run our schools ?

Granirer and Salvatore Stazzone , tried to force Mr. Genn out to control hiring. // Some board members have charged that Mr. Genn himself is guilty of cronyism .

" And in the end , that ' s the real shame. " //
