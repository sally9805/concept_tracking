The New England governors yesterday voted to maintain a small regional organization with money from the states , to replace the $5.3 million New England Regional Commission , an organization slated for elimination by the Reagan Administration . The governors agreed to fund a central office in Boston to coordinate state staff activity in such areas as tourism , transportation , hazardous waste disposal , international trade and trade adjustment assistance , according to Gov . Hugh J. Gallen of New Hampshire . The six states will each continue to contribute the $60,000 that previously went to the commission . The commission , which has a staff of 60 , has been criticized in the past as a federal patronage boondoggle . But in recent years , the organization says , it has developed some of its own policy analysis rather than serving almost exclusively as a funding conduit for consultants . Since the November election , however , many staff members have resigned . J. Joseph Grandmaison , the federal co-chairman of the commission and a Carter Administration appointee , resigned his position on March 5 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision has been made on the size or makeup of the central staff . Gallen said two longtime members of the regional commission staff , Charles Tretter , the commission counsel , and William Gilday , the acting executive director , will go to Washington next week to get more information on the funding status of the organization . Goelz saidneither he nor Gallen would speculate on whether present regional commission staffers might be retained by the new regional body . Gallen , who was chairman of the private morning meeting of the New England Governor ' s Conference at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston , said the governors adopted a resolution that called for a regional organization " necessary to make possible continued social and economic growth in New England . " They further pledged " to continue to work in concert to address the development objectives and processes of New England through a regional organization . . . " Reagan ' s Office of Management and Budget recommended no funding next year for the several regional commissions around the country next year , and urged a cutback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress approves the reduction , the programs would go out of business almost immediately instead of Sept. 30 , the last day of the federal fiscal year . While the US House Budget Committee voted to restore the $21 million earlier this week , some of the governors said the New England RegionalCommission ' s demise is inevitable . " We realize we may not be funded , but we are interested in continuing some programs , " said Gov . Joseph E. Brennan of Maine . " Regionalism makes more sense now than ever before , particularly with the drift to the Sunbelt . " " We understand the necessity of regionalism , " said Gov . Edward J. King of Massachusetts after the meeting . " We are willing to support regionalism as individual states . " The governors said that the small staff in Boston will coordinate the efforts of existing personnel in each of the New England states and continue to seek federal grants for regional programs . " We have the technical expertise in our own states , " explained Brennan . " We may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big group here in Boston . "
