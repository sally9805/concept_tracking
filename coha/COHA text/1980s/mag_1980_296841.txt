Carter and China 's Hua talk informally in Tokyo <P> Squalid politics , " fumed Republican Senator John Tower of Texas . G.O.P. National Chairman Bill Brock sniffed that Jimmy Carter " has a lot of nerve even showing up in this city . " But there he was smack-dab and unrepentant in Detroit , the capital of an auto industry that has been forced to lay off one-third of its workers . While the Republicans were getting ready to throw their big bash and coronation , Carter swept through town en route to Japan and illustrated the power of a President to steal headlines from his opponents by acting on problems they can only denounce . <P> Carter had been warned by a White House memo that " if we can not get auto and steel problems reasonably resolved , these issues alone will cost us Pennsylvania , Michigan , Ohio , Indiana and Missouri . " During a 40-minute meeting with auto executives that began at 7:05 a.m. , the President announced an aid program that could add up to $1 billion for the auto industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew on to Tokyo , a 14,740-mile , two-day trip that was primarily a symbolic gesture of amity toward an ally , Japan , and a new friend , the People 's Republic of China . The occasion was a memorial service for Japanese Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira , who had died June 12 , shortly before his Liberal Democratic Party swept to a resounding election victory . Among the dignitaries attending was Chinese Premier Hua Guofeng , whom Carter was eager to meet . <P> The President had no business to discuss with his Japanese hosts . It was hardly the occasion on which to bring up the problem of Japan 's booming auto exports to the U.S. ( 22% of total U.S. auto sales last month ) . Besides , as an aide to Transportation Secretary Neil Goldschmidt noted , at the moment " there is no Japanese government to negotiate with . " <P> To honor Ohira , Carter sat through a two-hour service in the Budokan , a martial-arts hall redecorated for the occasion . Premier Hua , dressed in a gray Mao jacket , was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not meet , they looked firmly at each other , as though each was taking the other 's measure . <P> At the close of the memorial service , all 243 foreign dignitaries filed past an urn containing Ohira 's ashes . Each made a low , formal bow , the traditional Japanese gesture of respect , except Carter , who barely nodded his head . But the Japanese , not expecting a newcomer to follow protocol , were not upset by Carter 's performance . Later , however , Carter clearly startled Ohira 's widow with a display of American informality while paying a call on her . He greeted her with a kiss , then slipped his arm around her waist when leading her into the Ohira family home . <P> Before meeting with Hua , Carter gave an interview on Japanese television designed to ease increasing Soviet worries that the U.S. and China were about to gang up on the Soviet Union . Said the President of the U.S.-China moves : " We believe that this relationship should not be used by either country against the Soviet Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we should combine our efforts to maintain peace .
