As the economy nosedives , Reagan 's men have their work cut out for them <P> It was not exactly a halcyon time for Cabinet making , as the Soviet shadow grew longer over Poland and the U.S. economy once again lurched out of control . But Washington can be a parochial town where people and power are concerned , and week after week the anticipation had been building . Rsums flowed into the drab transition headquarters . FBI agents conducted background checks . There was feverish speculation in the corridors of the bureaucracy , as well as in the daily accounts of newspapers and TV news broadcasts . But when the moment came for Ronald Reagan to announce his first eight selections for Cabinet-level jobs , it was an understated affair . The President-elect , true to his low-key posture since Election Day , stayed holed up in Blair House , the capital 's elegant residence for VIP guests . It was left to transition Press Spokesman James Brady to introduce the nominees to the 350 reporters gathered in the Mayflower Hotel ballroom . <P> Brady read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conductor calling out station stops , as a line of men , all in blue or gray suits , stepped before the TV cameras . For half an hour , they took turns answering questions or , more accurately , politely not answering them , explaining that they would have to become more familiar with their new jobs before they could say anything specific about their own views or the new Administration 's policies . Said Secretary of Commerce-designate Malcolm Baldrige , in the only semblance of lively comment : " I have n't even found the front door to the Department of Commerce yet . " <P> Still , the very lack of color-in the ceremony and in the group-said something important about the Administration that Reagan is putting together against a background of threatened economic and international crisis . Only one of the eight , Michigan Congressman David Stockman , stands out-for youth ( he is 34 ) and for passionately held views . He is a self-described fanatic in his devotion to minimal Government and supply-side economics ( which basically means stimulating the economy by cutting personal income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Office of Management and Budget , he should put some ginger into Cabinet debates . In a memo to Reagan that became public just before his selection for OMB was announced , Stockman and a close friend , New York Congressman Jack Kemp , urged the President-elect to declare a " national economic emergency " immediately after Inauguration . <P> The other seven are moderate conservatives , most of whom are better known as skilled managers than as innovative thinkers . Five can be considered members of the Eastern Republican Establishment . They are Pennsylvania Senator Richard Schweiker , who will be Secretary of Health and Human Services , and four businessmen : Baldrige ; Treasury Secretary-designate Donald Regan ; William Casey , who will head the CIA ; and Transportation Secretary-designate Drew Lewis . Two longtime California friends of Reagan 's fill out the group : Caspar Weinberger , chosen as Secretary of Defense , and William French Smith , Attorney General-designate . Even they are not typical Sunbelt hardliners ; in fact , their selections reinforce a surprisingly strong Ivy League cast in Reagan 's official family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
