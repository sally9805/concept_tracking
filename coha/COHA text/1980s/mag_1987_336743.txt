These are dire times for the United Nations . It is near bankruptcy , and unilateralism by the Great Powers is still very much the order of the day . Rarely has the world organization seemed less apt to fulfill its initial aspiration , to " save succeeding generations from the scourge of war . " <P> Thus there is something quixotic and timely about this memoir of a distinguished career spent under the blue-and-white U.N . flag . Its author does not redeem the battered organization in Turtle Bay but asserts elegantly that there is still nobility in the effort to give peace a chance . <P> Few public servants are better suited to making that case than Sir Brian Urquhart , a 40-year U.N . veteran who retired in 1986 after twelve years as Under Secretary-General for Special Political Affairs , the U.N . ' s premier troubleshooter . Urquhart traded compliments and barbs with most of the world 's statesmen and zealots  --  some of them interchangeable  --  who created the U.N . and then forced it to referee conflicts in the Sinai , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peacekeeping duties with sardonic wit . Of a 1984 visit to Israel , he observes , " Private friendliness and public denunciation of the U.N . indicated that a national election was in progress . " He reviews his triumphs , notably the Congo in the ' 60s , and disappointments , chiefly Lebanon in the ' 80s . <P> Urquhart served with every U.N . Secretary-General and has strong views on all of them . The first , the Norwegian Trygve Lie , he describes as an " unsophisticated man who relied . . . on peasant shrewdness " rather than brains or hard work . Dag Hammarskjold , killed in a 1961 plane crash in the Congo , was " shy but demanding , modest but arrogant , quiet but with a formidable capacity for anger and indignation , " says Urquhart , who has also written a biography of the man . <P> Urquhart is scathing about two-term Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim . The current President of Austria , he says , was an " energetic , ambitious mediocrity " who " demonstrated determination and even , on occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , integrity , inspiration , and leadership that the United Nations so desperately needs . " Urquhart says it was " mortifying " to discover that the man had lied with such energy about his Nazi past . <P> As a peacekeeper , Urquhart seems proudest of the U.N . ' s long efforts in Africa . He was kidnaped , beaten up and almost killed by rebellious Katangese troops , an adventure he shrugged off with the epigram " better beaten than eaten . " While he was willing enough to risk his neck for the U.N. , Urquhart has no illusions about its bureaucratism and pettifogging ways . Why , then , should its fumbling efforts continue ? Because , says Urquhart , " if you hold on to your belief in reason and compassion despite all political maneuvering , your efforts may in the end produce results . " In the meantime , reason and compassion have produced a fine book .
