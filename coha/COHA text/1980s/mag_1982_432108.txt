 | Chances are growing that it will take most regions of the country at least until midsummer to pick up the pieces from a deep recession and get business rolling again . Experts fear the slump that started in autos and housing will spread rapidly through other industries in the opening months of the new year . In the Midwest , farmers will be hurt by sagging prices for their goods . The East will suffer from government cutbacks and ailing heavy industry . In the Far West , lagging airliner and lumber production will be the culprits , while the Southeast will be damaged by weakness in the construction industry . " A lot of pain and agony will have to be suffered before there is a strong comeback , starting in the second half of the year , " says economist Tom Graves of Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles . Still , by midyear , the foundation will be in place for a long and vibrant business recovery that will create millions of jobs , many forecasters say . Behind that expected upturn : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax cuts and a hefty boost in military spending . Those predictions come out of talks by U. S. News &; World Report correspondents with economists , business owners , farmers and government officials . Following is their size-up of business prospects for each of the nation 's regions in the year ahead . NEW ENGLAND : Defense Money Businesses in the Northeast are counting on technology and defense industries to keep the region from suffering as much as the rest of the country . Military contracts will mean some 65 billion dollars and 165,000 new jobs over the next five years for Connecticut and Massachusetts , according to James Howell , vice president of the First National Bank of Boston . These states , with just 4 percent of the U.S. population , will get about 13 percent of defense-hardware contracts , he says . Adds economist Hans Wentrup of the New Hampshire Public Service Company : " Firms are waiting to see what kind of defense contracts are negotiated , and they are trying to hold on to their skilled help . " The shortage of quality workers is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months looking for just one computer operator . Defense contracts wo n't help right away , however . General Electric expects its Pittsfield , Mass. , facility to win contracts for the ordnance system of the Trident 2 submarines ? but the craft wo n't be finished until the late 1980s . " Looking to late 1982 and 1983 , defense spending will be quite a plus , but now it is just a cushion , " says Lynn Browne , economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston . In anticipation of contracts for the overhaul of Navy and commercial vessels , Bath Iron Works is working with city and state officials to upgrade facilities in Portland , Me . High-technology projects are keeping the Vermont unemployment rate below 5 percent . Mitel Corporation in South Burlington , a maker of telephone switchboards , plans to enlarge its 110-person work force to 300 in 1982 and to 500 by the end of 1983 . In New Hampshire , it is tourism that is expected to keep the economy going . Skiers this winter will bring 1 million dollars a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders say . Throughout the region , some weak spots wo n't go away . Residential construction is at a standstill ; the city of Boston is hit by budget cutbacks , and foreign competition is hurting Rhode Island 's jewelry industry . Many firms also balk at investing in new projects , says Kenneth Decko , president of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association . Most companies will not take full advantage of the government 's tax cuts until interest rates decline further , he explains . ATLANTIC : Spreading Trouble States from New York to Virginia may find their diversified economies slumping more than usual during this recession . " We do n't have as much momentum as before , " says economist Thomas Spitznas of Chemical Bank in New York . " The retail-sales boom is over , manufacturing is slipping badly ; the apparel industry is in a depression and total jobs have been declining quarter by quarter . " Hotel vacancies are up in New York ,  | and the city is facing a potential budget gap of 1 billion dollars in the fiscal year ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executives surveyed last summer by the First Pennsylvania Bank said business conditions would worsen . But in a recent poll , 31 percent felt that way . Store owners are especially wary . At Market East Gallery in Philadelphia , Rick Dunston , assistant manager of the mall , says that " we 've had more turnover of shops in the last six months than we ever had . The marginal merchants just have not been able to stand the strain of recession . " Even Washington , D.C. , once hailed as recessionproof , anticipates some jolt as the year wears on . Notes Robert R. Nathan , chairman of a consulting firm : " The District may feel this recession more than ever , because it coincides with the substantial reduction in staff and expenditures at the federal level .

The high-technology AAI Corporation in Baltimore expects to double its staff of 2,500 workers over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit-card operations to Wilmington , in response to a Delaware law removing most interest-rate ceilings . Foreign demand for coal is helping the outlook in the mining state of West Virginia . At Hampton Roads , Va. , coal shipments are expected to increase from 50 million tons in 1981 to 55 million in 1982 , creating some 5,000 new jobs . Consolidation Coal Company , a major operator in the region , plans to mine about 6 percent more coal in 1982 . Pay increases for the military are cheered by merchants in southeastern Virginia , where 40 percent of the employment is related to defense . Three major ship-repair facilities in the Norfolk area have expansions in the works , meaning at least 1,000 new jobs . Military-consulting firms may bring back jobs to the Washington area .

" SOUTHEAST : Uphill Road It will be a long , hard pull out of recession for textile , furniture , steel and other manufacturing industries . Employment in South Carolina textile firms will decline from 143,000 in 1979 to 129,000 in 1982 and may keep on falling , says economist Richard Ellson of the University of South Carolina . " If conditions do n't improve rapidly , we 'll see more plant closings , " he says . Drops in sales of jeans , carpets and other home furnishings ? plus competition from abroad ? are to blame . The furniture industry in the Carolinas has been hurt by the housing slump and a feeling among consumers that they can put off buying in tough times . Doug Brackett , executive vice president of the Southern Furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he sees a slight upturn in the second half of the year .

GREAT LAKES : Auto Worries Unless the automobile industry can make a comeback from a disastrous 1981 , much of this area will continue to languish . Yet auto makers fear conditions wo n't improve for some six months . " Clearly , the 1982 picture is not too rosy , " says Ford President Donald Peterson . Further fogging the outlook are worries about labor unrest as companies try to extract wage concessions from auto workers whose contracts are up for negotiation in 1982 . " I see the makings of a real confrontation this time around , possibly even strikes , " says Detroit auto-industry analyst Arvid Jouppi . Prospects are n't much better for the steel industry . As 1981 came to a close . new orders and shipments were falling . " We would expect that markets for most steel products would be soft as we continue into 1982 , " says David Roderick , chairman of U.S. Steel . Such conditions could in turn mean another hard year for the region 's retailers . Many foresee a gradual improvement in the summer as another tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be enough .

About 75,000 jobs have been lost in construction and heavy-manufacturing industries , says Wisconsin Revenue Secretary Mark Musolf . In Chicago , the housing market is almost at rock bottom . New construction dropped from 49,000 starts in 1979 to 10,500 in 1981 , says Edmund Sorenson , president of the Homebuilders Association of Greater Chicago . " If interest rates do come down , we could see a good housing market because of pentup demand , " he predicts . However , commercial building remains strong , with some 9 million square feet of office space under construction in the downtown section . Midwest farmers are in trouble because of a surplus of crops nationwide and too much rain in some areas . " Indiana farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in a market where Far West Troubles in film , aviation , lumber industries worry business leaders , but an upturn is predicted by summer , when hefty increases in defense spending and new tax cuts take hold . prices will be down , " says Earl Park , chief of the Indiana Crop and Livestock Reporting Service . CENTRAL , MOUNTAIN : Farm Woe Businesses other than farming will have to carry the load for states in the nation 's midsection . Prices for corn , soybeans and grain sorghum are down about 25 percent from a year ago and cattle prices are down 10 percent , says Donald Hovendick , president of the Federal Intermediate Credit Bank of Omaha .

Business is strong , too , at Honeywell , Control Data and 3M in Minneapolis .

In Wyoming , the booming oil-and-gas industry " will keep us out of trouble for years , " says John Logan , state **30;431;TOOLONG specialist . Montana , too , is counting on energy exploration , but the state is worried about job losses in its copper-mining , railroad and timber industries . SOUTHWEST : Race for Energy Energy exploration promises to protect Texas and its neighbors from the recession . " This part of the country will be one of the strongest economically because of oil and gas , " says Kenneth Sager , financial director of the ENSERCH Corporation in Dallas . Robert L. Parker , Jr. , president of Parker Drilling Company of Tulsa , sees spending for oil and gas exploration rising in 1982 by 15 to 20 percent ? slower than 1981 's " phenomenal " rate but still a healthy pace . Typical of cities gaining due to the oil boom is Corpus Christi .

" Firms building higher-priced , singlefamily housing will continue to do well , predicts Ed Lee , president of Woodlands Group of Mitchell Energy &; Development in Houston .

Companies such as Motorola in Phoenix are expanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobless rates in Phoenix and Tucson are only about 5 percent .

Black , Texas A &M; University agricultural specialist , describes as " dismal . " Things could change in the second half of 1982 if demand from overseas consumers is strong . Says Black : " If Russia will buy ? and we will sell to them ? and if other countries such as Japan and India are in the market on a large scale , we can turn this around . " FAR WEST : Tight Budgets The Pacific Coast , shielded from the 1980 recession , will take its lumps , too . " We 're going through the worst times now , " says economist Joseph Wahed of Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco , " but there 's still bad news to come .

Lockheed-California is phasing out production of its L-1011 TriStar , eliminating 9,000 jobs .

In the San Francisco area , officials are concerned about scattered layoffs in the " Silicon Valley " semiconductor industry and furloughs at General Motors and Ford auto-assembly plants in Fremont and Milpitas . Yet the area is looking forward to defense contracts and to benefits from pay increases at its numerous military installations .

Sohio and Arco plan to put 9.5 billion dollars into development of North Slope oil fields over five years . Anchorage is undergoing a downtown construction boom , and even housing construction is strong due to a statefunded program that enables Alaskans to borrow for new-home purchases at interest rates below 13 percent .
