As Pretoria continues a crackdown , Reagan denounces apartheid <P> According to Ronald Reagan , it was a matter of conscience . Administration critics suspected that he had political considerations in mind . Whatever the reason , the President last week felt a need to retreat , at least briefly , from one of his Administration 's most staunchly held foreign strategies . In an International Human Rights Day address , Reagan paused in a litany of familiar themes ( the Soviets ' " barbaric war " in Afghanistan , Iran 's persecution of the Baha'i religious minority ) to broach a surprise topic . " The U.S. has said on many occasions that we view racism with repugnance , " he asserted . He then confessed " our grief over the human and spiritual cost of apartheid in South Africa . " <P> Specifically , Reagan called for an end to two South African policies : 1 ) the forced relocation of several million of the country 's 23 million blacks , most of them to remote , impoverished " homelands , " and 2 ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the President , " can comfort only those whose vision of South Africa 's future is one of polarization , violence and the final extinction of any hope for a peaceful democratic government . " Reagan asked the government in Pretoria to broaden " the constructive changes of recent years ... to address the aspirations of all South Africans . " <P> The President 's unusual public utterance was his first lengthy and specific statement on the subject of apartheid , South Africa 's policy of racial separation , since he took office . The move was seen by many of Reagan 's critics and supporters alike as a sharp change within the Administration 's longstanding policy of " constructive engagement , " in which open criticism of South Africa is deliberately suppressed in favor of behind-the-scenes encouragement of improvements in race relations . U.S. officials , however , quickly denied that anything had changed . The President 's remarks , said State Department Spokesman Alan Romberg , were " fully consistent with what we have been saying , and will continue to say , both publicly and privately to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy at all . " <P> In fact , there was widespread suspicion in Washington that Reagan was bowing to a wave of anti-apartheid protest that continued to grow last week in the capital and at least 13 other U.S. cities . Two miles from the Old Executive Office Building , where the President spoke , a steady trickle of luminaries continued to join the picket line that sprang up in front of the South African embassy three weeks ago . In all , more than 50 people , including 13 members of Congress , have been arrested in the protest . Among those charged with trespassing or crossing a police line last week were Democratic Representatives Louis Stokes of Ohio and Mickey Leland of Texas , along with various civil rights leaders .
