The audience leaped to embrace the speaker while sitting still . They ate him up . His words were devoured the way seals snap at fish . You could see the words settle in the crowd 's bellies ; 25,000 satisfied customers packing New York City 's Madison Square Garden last Monday night to hear Minister Louis Farrakhan , head of the Nation of Islam , bring his dual message of self-help and hate . The message of hate predominated . How the crowd hungered for that meal . At the words of defiance they stood and roared . At the in-jokes they laughed joyfully . At the derisive words they smiled and sneered . The converted attended the preacher . <P> Why has n't the press observed that he reminds them of Jesus , demanded Farrakhan to cheers , applause . " Jesus was hated by the Jews . Farrakhan is hated by the Jews " ( more cheers , knowing laughter ) . " Who were the enemies of Jesus ? " ( cries of " Jews ! " ) . " The Jewish lobby has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes ! , " " Tell ' em , Brother ! " ) . " I am your last chance , Jews . " It will be too late " when God puts you in the oven " ( ovation , delight ) . <P> And yet : " They call me racist , they call me bigoted , they call me anti- Semitic . " No ! You , Brother Farrakhan ? What could those reporters be thinking of ? <P> Still , it was n't Farrakhan who got you down Monday night , or the gang of preliminary speakers railing against the Jewish domination of Hollywood and the international Jewish conspiracy . It was n't the savage courtesies of the people who checked the audience for weapons ; all 25,000 were frisked individually . It was n't the uniforms of the Fruit of Islam guards , men in deep blue caps and suits , looking like parodies of club-car porters , or the female guards surrounding Farrakhan as he spoke , wearing white kepis and robes that looked like doormen 's coats . Nothing that occurred on stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subway cursing the " niggers " or the " spics . " <P> It was the audience that froze the night , the mostly young , carefully dressed crowd of black men , women and children who had clearly come home to Brother Farrakhan . Discount some of their zeal as a **25;8322;TOOLONG exercise . Discount some as exuberance or hysteria in numbers . Still , the Garden heaved with hatred . If you closed your eyes you could picture all the hate mobs ever  --  Khomeini 's mob , Kahane 's mob . Their hatred was palpable , enormous . It changed reality . Suddenly the crowd was in the millions , encompassing the living and the dead .
