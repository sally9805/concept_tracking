The constitution is coming <P> In the 13 years since Pierre Elliott Trudeau was first elected Prime Minister , he has had one ambition above all others : to give his vast , fragmented land a constitution that would ensure its survival as a unified state . Last week after he made several important compromises , all but one of the eight provincial premiers who have stonewalled Trudeau 's plans for 14 months dropped their opposition . After 114 years , declared the ebullient Prime Minister , " Canada will become , in a technical and legal sense , an independent country . " Still , Trudeau faced one important challenge to his dream . The lone holdout against his plan among the ten premiers was Ren Lvesque , leader of predominantly French-speaking Quebec , who warned , " Never will we accept that our traditional and fundamental powers be removed without our consent . " <P> Since 1867 the basis of Canada 's loose federal system has been the British North America ( B.N.A. ) Act . Over the decades , Britain has retained possession of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to agree on how to amend the statute . Six weeks ago , the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that the government had the right to ask Britain to relinquish the B.N.A. Act , with changes requested by Trudeau . It stressed , however , that Canada 's unwritten tradition required " at least a substantial measure of provincial consent . " <P> There was the rub . Trudeau wanted the British to write into the constitution a charter of rights that the premiers feared would impinge upon their present autonomy , which allows them , for instance , to limit the hiring of people who move into their provinces from other areas . Trudeau also wanted the British to add a provision to the act that would limit the rights of the provinces to block constitutional amendments . <P> Trudeau persuaded nine premiers to accept a charter of rights . But to get an agreement he had to surrender on several points , including the process for amending the constitution . Under the formula , any amendment would have to be approved by at least seven provinces with 50% of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment could simply refuse to observe the change . <P> Levesque rejected Trudeau 's compromise because of his bitter opposition to a point in the charter of rights that Trudeau considers basic : the right of English-and French-speaking minorities in provinces dominated by the other language to be educated in their mother tongue . Lvesque 's government has been passing legislation restricting the use of English in commerce as well as education . <P> Quebec 's opposition will not stop the Canadian Parliament from calling upon the British Parliament to transfer the B. N. A. Act , complete with the new amending formula and charter of rights , to Ottawa . No real trouble is expected in London now that Trudeau has satisfied the concerns of the Canadian Supreme Court . Still , the compromise left Lvesque , whose Parti Quebecois favors independence for the French-speaking province , disquietingly isolated and the course of his future actions in doubt . " Quebec finds itself alone , " he declared . " It will be up to the Quebec people to draw their conclusions . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
