NASA and the Soviets reach for a permanent foothold in space <P> " The next logical step " : that is what NASA planners are calling their dream of a permanent manned station in orbit . Such a development , they argue , would help bring about the era of cheap and easily accessible exploitation of space for science , technology development and commerce . Yet while NASA is still trying to garner support for its vision , the Soviets are already pushing ahead to build their own permanent space station . <P> Unlike the Americans , the Soviets have been single-minded and persistent in pursuit of this goal . Their most recent and notable achievements have been the coupling in March of the Salyut 7 orbital station with an unmanned Cosmos satellite and then in June with the manned Soyuz T-9 capsule to form a single orbiting complex . The linking of the Cosmos with Salyut 7 has doubled the amount of working space available to cosmonauts aboard the space station . In addition , the latest Cosmos has thruster jets that enable it to change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a " space tugboat . " It also has a bell-shaped descent module , a detachable section that can ferry materials and experiments back to earth-something that the Soviets previously could not do with the cramped Soyuz . <P> The new capabilities of the Salyut-Cosmos-Soyuz complex are currently being tested by the cosmonaut team of Vladimir Lyakhov and Alexander Alexandrov , who joined Salyut on June 28 . ( A previous docking attempt by three other cosmonauts in April was aborted , because of a faulty guidance system . ) As usual , the Soviets have been vague in defining the nature of experiments conducted by the pair , other than to admit that it includes orbital photography . <P> Western experts believe that the Soviets ' eventual goal is to have a continuous manned presence in orbit , with rotating shifts of cosmonauts at a permanent space base . NASA Administrator James Beggs earlier this month warned that the U.S. was in danger of losing its pre-eminence in space unless it pressed forward with a program to build its own space station . <P> Such a plan is currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not settled on any one design for a station , preferring to think through the idea further before submitting it to the Administration . An official on the Space Station Task Force has said , however , that NASA is contemplating a " modest but useful " station with room for six-to-eight crew members . Such a station , which would probably consist of several modules for manufacturing , conducting scientific experiments and other uses , could be in operation by 1991 . Possible price tag : $8 billion to $9 billion . <P> For both the Soviets and the Americans , a permanent space station could provide innumerable benefits . Everything from zero-g manufacturing of near perfect crystals for electronics to routine expeditions to the moon and the other planets could move from the realm of expensive experiment into everyday reality .
