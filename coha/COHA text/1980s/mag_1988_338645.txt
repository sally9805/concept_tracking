It 's the middle of the night . While most of Miami is sleeping , Casanovas , the area 's most electric disco , has just received its wake-up call . Attractive young women teeter across the dance floor in vertiginous high heels , their hourglass figures accentuated by off-the-shoulder Lycra tops and tight leather micromini-skirts . Handsome , heavily cologned men in open-neck shirts keep the ladies under close observation , hoping to spot the sideways glance and quick nod that signify a turn on the floor . <P> Visual signals are everything : hard-pounding loudspeakers woof and tweet to the strains of Tito Puente , Hansel y Raul and Willie Colon . The songs are mostly rhythmically irresistible salsa songs that combine the heady call-and- response of African music with the electronic surge of rock ' n ' roll and the glitzy brass of a Big Band . The dancers move to the beat like a snake to the charmer 's call : the hotter the tune , the cooler the step as the men expertly guide the women through the twists and curves of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumba . <P> On this evening , though , the crowd has come for something special . Like middle-class Italian kids flocking to see Sinatra at Carnegie Hall , the young Cuban Americans have gathered to see the reigning Reina de la Salsa , Celia Cruz , who was entertaining their parents and their parents ' parents in the smoky dens and fancy nightclubs of pre-Castro Cuba long before they were born . <P> With 70 albums and 40 years in the business behind her , Cruz , seventyish , handsome , dark-skinned and wearing a snug , sequined fuchsia gown , gyrates for 90 minutes to the insistent beat of her razor-sharp backup band . At the refrain of her old favorite Canto a la Habana ( Song to Havana )  --  " Cuba que lindos son tus paisajes " ( Cuba , what beautiful vistas you have )  --  the bilingual crowd goes wild , even though most of those present have never seen Cuba and have little prospect of ever doing so . " We 've never had to attract these kids . They come by themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them , but they still want to know about their roots . The Cuban rhythms are so contagious that they end up making room for both kinds of music in their lives . " <P> Weaned on Anglophonic rock ' n ' roll , Americans have long been resistant to foreign pop-musical imports whose accents are other than English . ABBA , the Europop megagroup of the ' 70s , sang in English , not Swedish ; Japan 's Pink Lady was a bomb in any language . But the Latin sound could be different . <P> The Miami Sound Machine and its spitfire lead singer , Gloria Estefan , sold 1.25 million albums containing their saucy 1985 hit , Conga , which combined American pop with salsa rhythms and established the hybrid " Miami Sound . " ( " **36;9546;TOOLONG nga , I-know-you- **33;9584;TOOLONG . " ) The song hit the Latin , black , pop and dance charts and made a crossover star of the Cuban-born , Miami-raised Estefan , 30 .
