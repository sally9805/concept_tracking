With India 's voters set to go to the polls next week , the country 's attention was focused less on politics than on a religious dispute over the future of a 16th century mosque in the North Indian town of Ayodhya . Militant Hindu groups claim that India 's Mogul conquerors built the mosque after destroying a temple marking the birthplace of the Hindu god Rama . The militants demand that a temple to Rama be built on the spot . India 's Muslim minority fiercely objects to the plan . As tension has mounted in recent weeks , at least 400 people , most of them Muslims , have been killed in communal rioting . <P> With Hindus accounting for 83% of India 's 833 million people , Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi permitted the militants to lay the foundation stone for the new temple last week . The Hindu extremists are the vanguard of a growing movement led by the Bharatiya Janata Party . Its aim : to establish a Hindu Rashtra  --  Hindu Nation .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
