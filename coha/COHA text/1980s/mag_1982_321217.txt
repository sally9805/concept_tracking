" The energy crisis has not yet overwhelmed us , but it will if we do not act quickly .. . Our decision about energy will test the character of the American people and the ability of the President and the Congress to govern this nation . This difficult effort will be the ' moral equivalent of war , ' except that we will be uniting our efforts to build and not to destroy . " <P> <P> - Address to the nation , April 18,1977 <P> Then I declared the energy effort to be the moral equivalent of war , a phrase coined by William James and suggested to me by Admiral Hyman Rickover , it was impossible for me to imagine the bloody legislative battles ahead . Throughout my entire term , Congress and I struggled with energy legislation . Despite my frustration , there was never a moment when I did not consider the creation of a national energy policy equal in importance to any other goal . <P> There was no doubt in my mind that our national security was at stake . In 1973 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were importing about 35% of our oil . When I took office , our dependence on uncertain foreign oil supplies had grown to almost 50%-about 9 million bbl. a day . We were the only developed nation without an energy policy , and our total energy consumption was at a record high . The program put into effect during my term has now reversed the movement toward disaster . In some ways the bitter four-year struggle that proved necessary made the final victory even sweeter . <P> Our problems in 1977 were twofold . In the long run , available supplies of oil and natural gas would not be able to meet growing demand . We owed it to future generations to stop wasting so much energy and find other sources for fuel . The immediate problems were serious enough . Our excessive purchases on the world oil market were helping to force prices ever upward , and spasmodic shortages were damaging to the American economy . We were afflicted with both inflation and unemployment , and there was special suffering among the aged and poor . <P> The international dangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ susceptible to potential political blackmail from the oil-producing nations . Consumer nations that had little or no energy of their own were especially vulnerable and were inclined to modify their foreign policies accordingly . <P> Ignoring these unpleasant facts would have had grave consequences . Some of our more militant leaders were already talking about plans to seize foreign oilfields by force if our supplies were cut off again . Many others deeply resented that the greatest nation on earth was being jerked around by a few desert states . <P> We realized that in order to stimulate American production and encourage conservation , our domestic prices would have to rise , but in a predictable and orderly fashion , so that consumers of petroleum products would be protected from unreasonable fuel bills issued by an uncontrolled semimonopoly . Also , the unearned profits from higher prices needed to be shared with the consuming public .
