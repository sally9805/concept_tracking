As always , Jesse Jackson was late-three hours behind schedule this time-as his motorcade sped through down town Baltimore on a chilly , misty afternoon last week . The procession of cars , vans and buses wove in and out of rush-hour traffic , red and blue lights flashing and police sirens wailing . Clots of office workers gathered outside the trendy shops and restaurants of Harborplace to watch . The caravan zipped by them and into East Baltimore , an area of sagging row houses , many disfigured by broken or boarded-up windows . <P> The streets initially were empty , but when the motorcade turned into North Bond , a crowd of 400 people came into view several blocks ahead . Many who had made the mistake of thinking Jackson would keep his schedule had turned out early and been waiting four or even seven hours to greet their hero , but their spirits had not been dimmed . When a navy blue Chrysler New Yorker pulled to a halt and the candidate leaped out , the crowd surged over wooden police barricades chanting , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadly , strode into the throng , surrounded by apprehensive Secret Service agents who formed a circle around him ; one kept a tight grip on the back of Jackson 's raincoat so that he could yank the candidate down immediately if any danger arose . None did ; Jackson 's admirers obviously wanted only to touch and be touched . A young man dressed in a dirty sweatshirt and blue jeans held his open right . hand in front of him and exclaimed in wonder , " I shook his hand ! I shook the man 's hand ! " <P> Jackson worked his way through the crowd and into a campaign headquarters ( " outreach center , " in his terminology ) , and campaign workers arranged the scene for his speech . An aide pointed to the spot where the candidate would stand and shouted , " Rainbow , rainbow ! " It was a signal to another assistant to plunge into the predominantly black throng and look for whites who could be brought up front to stand near Jackson , so that photographs would show the preacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing artificial about the response when Jackson emerged to speak . His talks are not connected discourses but collections of applause lines that bring shouts of " All right ! . . . Talk it up , Jesse ! . . . Yessir ! " building steadily . He begins slowly , his voice strong but not strident , his phrases short . He gathers speed and volume , often breaking into a cadence that scans well as impromptu free verse : <P> Yesterday was a day <P> Of mixed emotions for me . <P> Jesus was crucified on Friday , <P> Resurrected on Sunday . <P> That 's great joy <P> Because the stone was rolled away . <P> But for the poor of Baltimore , <P> For the malnourished of our nation , <P> For the poor mothers <P> Who can not get prenatal care , <P> For children who can not get <P> A breakfast program or lunch programs , <P> For the youth who ca n't get a skill , <P> They were crucified on Friday , <P> Crucified on Saturday , <P> Crucified on Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still bleeding , <P> The thorns are still on their heads . <P> I say it 's time for the poor <P> To realize resurrection , <P> To stop the hammers , stop the nails , <P> Wheel the stone away .
