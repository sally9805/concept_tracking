Burlington Northern Inc. said it will take a $1. 9 billion pre-tax charge against earnings , reflecting accounting changes and write-down trends sweeping through the oil , gas and railroad industries . Seattle-based Burlington , which has interests in railroads , forest products , natural gas pipelines and minerals , did not disclose many details of the huge one-time charge . The company said it will provide more information when it releases its second-quarter earnings during the week of July 21 . It wasn ' t clear how much of the charge will be taken against second-quarter earnings , but the company said it would be taken " primarily " in the second period  --  making it one of the largest charges ever for a single quarter . In the 1985 second quarter , Burlington earned $158. 4 million , or $1. 92 a share , on revenue of $2. 1 billion . In New York , Moody ' s Investors Service Inc. reacted to Burlington ' s announcement by placing the company ' s preferred stock , bonds and commercial paper under review for possible downgrading . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " plan , but added that the move wasn ' t in response to any particular takeover threat . During the past year , Burlington ' s stock has fallen from a high of $82. 375 a share . In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Burlington closed at $62. 875 a share , down $1. 125 . The relatively slight fall in the stock ' s value yesterday indicated that the charge , while huge , didn ' t alarm or surprise investors . Indeed , Burlington joins a number of oil and gas companies and railroad concerns in writing down the value of assets . Companies using the full-cost method of accounting for oil and gas have had to write down the value of their reserves because of the sharp decline in energy prices since January . Moreover , railroad companies last year started to write down the value of obsolete equipment and other property that aren ' t generating much income . The company ' s move " didn ' t surprise anybody on the street , " said Craig W. Hart , an analyst at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge will be a big dent in Burlington ' s net worth , reported at $4. 83 billion as of March 31 , " I ' d be very surprised " if the lowered balance-sheet ratios impede Burlington ' s access to capital markets , said analyst James M. Voytko of Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins . In taking the write-down , Burlington joins several other oil and gas companies  --  including Tenneco Inc . , Petro-Lewis Corp. and Pennzoil Co.  --  which have been forced by the collapse of energy prices to report big quarterly losses . Several railroad holding companies  --  including Union Pacific Corp . , New York , and CSX Corp , Richmond , Va.  --  have reported big write-downs of unproductive track and equipment . In June , for instance , Union Pacific announced a $1. 7 billion pre-tax charge related to an extensive restructuring of the company . Burlington also said it is continuing to reduce its work force , but the company didn ' t specify the size or timing of future layoffs . The railroad alone has dropped its staffing level to 35 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company ' s natural gas pipeline subsidiary has reduced its work force 30% in the last three years . Severance settlements for these staff reductions have amounted to about $250 million , the company said , all of which was charged against earnings at the time of payment . At the end of 1985 , the company had a total of 45 , 000 employees . Without giving exact numbers , the company outlined four principal sources of the $1. 9 billion charge . These include a change in the company ' s oil and gas accounting methods from the full-cost approach to the " successful efforts " technique ; a write-down of oil and gas properties precipitated by the fall of energy prices ; a write-down of railroad assets reflecting a new depreciation method ; and a write-off of surplus railroad assets . Burlington ' s first-quarter net income fell 31% to $106. 9 million , or $1. 30 a share , from a year earlier . Revenue fell 19% to $1. 9 billion . The company ' s 1985 net rose 8. 3% to $658. 3 million , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s second-quarter write-down of its oil and gas reserves comes after the Securities and Exchange Commission shocked the oil and gas industry in May by denying a proposal to allow companies to postpone write-downs until the end of their accounting years . SEC staff members had advised the commissioners to grant the temporary reprieve , arguing that companies should be allowed to wait and see if energy prices climb before adjusting their books to recent declines . Burlington ' s switch to successful-efforts accounting , a method by which companies charge the costs of their unsuccessful wells against current earnings and capitalize only successful exploration projects , probably will necessitate restating prior years ' earnings . But the accounting method improves future profitability by eliminating deferred costs . Concerning its anti-takeover plan , Burlington later this month will issue stock-purchase rights to shareholders entitling them to buy common shares at half price under certain circumstances . The rights aren ' t triggered until a person or group buys or makes an offer to buy 20% or more of the company ' s common without board approval . Once triggered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at half price , in the event of a merger or takeover . Burlington management can buy back the rights for five cents each until the 20% threshold is reached . Additionally , if an individual or group acquires 25% or more of the company ' s common without making a tender offer for all the company ' s shares outstanding , the rights of all other holders become immediately exercisable . A spokesman said the dilutive effect of such a provision is designed to foil two-tier takeover attempts , in which shareholders who don ' t initially tender their shares subsequently receive lower compensation for their holdings . Burlington said the rights , which aren ' t taxable and will trade automatically when shares are sold , won ' t physically be sent to shareholders . The distribution of one right for each share held will take place July 24 . Burlington also announced that it will redeem for $317 million the approximately 6. 6 million of its no-par adjustable-rate preferred shares outstanding for $48 each . The company said the the move will complete a $565 million redemption program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-cost preferred issues from its capital structure .
