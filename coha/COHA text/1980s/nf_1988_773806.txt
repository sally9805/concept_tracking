txt // or something like this , then he will suffer a loss . Or when the wheat turns out well , it forms a twist in the field . Then people say , " The Lord gave him abundant blessings this year . " And soon you see him suffering a loss ? his child dies , or his cow , or one of his sheep . To prevent this , the blood of an animal is sacrificed . I do n't know how this works and I myself do n't believe much in these things . 5 The Old Teacher : Idealistic Humanism Now in his fifties , he is the oldest teacher in the village . His life story is the story of the beginnings of education and the end of the tribal chiefs ' oppression . A peasant 's son himself , he obtained a four-grade elementary school education in the 1930 's from the first secular teacher in the village , an urbanite sent by Reza Shah 's government . In 1938 he himself was appointed as one of the first native teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his activity was cut short . With the collapse of Iran 's governmental power in 1941 , the supreme tribal chief , the Khan , returned from his exile in Tehran and re-established his reign in the region . He forced the Old Teacher to stop teaching because he did not want people to become educated and because he suspected the teacher of instigating the people against him . Two years later the Khan even imprisoned him , kept him chained for ten days , and forced him to sign a declaration that he would not accept any government appointment without the Khan 's consent . For the next five years the Old Teacher could not do much more than tend his fields , but in 1948 a military garrison was established in the area and in 1949 he was allowed to resume teaching in his native village . There he had to master an educational onrush : up to ninety-five students , spread over four grades , crowded his classroom . After urgent pleas for help , the school administration eventually appointed a second teacher , also from a local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction was introduced . But the Khan still wielded considerable influence even if his physical exercise of power had become restricted . He intrigued against the unwelcome teacher by depicting him as a communist who agitated against the Landlord and the paying of tributes until the Old Teacher was recalled from his post and sent to the village of a staunch henchman of the Khan . Warned that the Khan planned an attempt on his life , the Old Teacher wrote to the 61 // school administration , saying that he was aware of the danger awaiting him at his new post , but that he would accept it if the administration insisted , and that a copy of his letter was being sent to Tehran . The letter produced the desired effect and the assignment was changed to another village . After a year , with the help of a doctor 's certificate and a month 's salary worth of bribe , he succeeded in persuading the superintendent to re-assign him to his home village . From then onward , without further disturbance , he could attend to his great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the Khan 's insurrection of 1963 , which shook the region for half a year , interrupted his teaching activity . In 1958 sixth-grade instruction was introduced , and in the same year the Teacher Training Institute in Shiraz admitted the first two students from the village , who returned as teachers the following year . More new local teachers were appointed during the next ten years , and classes were split along grade and gender lines . By 1970 , fifteen teachers , including five women , were employed in the village and its landlord suburb . Now the Old Teacher is a veteran who expects to retire soon . But his educational zeal and fervor , which so markedly structure his attitude and personality , are as strong as ever . One afternoon I met him in one of his gardens studying a text on higher mathematics " in order to keep up with it ; " as he said . Even stronger is his concern for the education of children . One latefall evening , walking back to the village from work in a garden , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut off a tree . Tenderly putting his hand on the boy 's shoulder , the Old Teacher asked him why he had stopped coming to school . The boy lowered his head shyly . Only after some affectionate insistence by the Teacher he revealed that his father had hired him out as a shepherd . The Old Teacher was upset . As he walked away , he asked desperately , " How can a father , for the sake of a few toman , deprive a child of such a thing as education ? " The Old Teacher is considered to be one of the richest villagers . Not only has he earned a salary over a longer period than anybody else , but he also owns more land than many peasants who have to subsist on it . Most of this land he has transformed into some of the finest vineyards and orchards of the area in years of relentless effort and intensive care . " Zarathustra has taught us to hold trees in high esteem , and this spirit is in our family too . My grandfather considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . In the afternoons , after school , he invariably can be seen busy in one of his gardens . Only recently he planted new fruit trees provided by the Development Corps. // This untiring industry is matched by a frugal life style . Only two old carpets cover the floor of his living room . In winter he moves into a smaller room to save on the expenses for firewood . He even keeps some sheep and goats to be as self-sufficient as possible , like any peasant . The family 's store of raisins , walnuts , and almonds is treated like a treasure , consumed sparingly and with a sense of preciousness . It should last well into the next year in case of a crop failure . By the same token , tea-drinking is rare in his house . This is quite unique in view of the general addiction to tea among this people . It stems from the rational insight that tea and sugar account for at least 1000 toman , that is about half the total annual cash budget of a family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the reputation of a somewhat tightfisted miser . His only legitimate reason for spending money freely appears to be education , and nothing seems to be too costly when it comes to that . Last year he transferred his oldest son from a high school in the small town where most of the village boys are sent ? if they are sent at all ? to one in the much more expensive city of Shiraz because he believes that education is better there . He sends food to the boy with villagers who travel to Shiraz . This reflects his permanent concern for his children 's well-being as well as his attempts to reduce costs . His second son passed the final elementary examinations as best student of the village and subsequently made it also through the highly competitive entrance examination into the prestigious tribal secondary school in Shiraz . The Old Teacher definitely expects him to go on to university and has similar expectations for his other five sons . He regrets being barred by moral tradition from sending his two daughters , who completed six years of elementary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For some time he even considered moving there himself to better care for his children and to give his daughters a chance to attend high school , too , but he feels he can not afford this . ( 1971 ) . How did you come to think the way you do about the chiefs and the people ? When the chiefs were still in power , the people were downtrodden , intimidated , exploited , tortured , mutilated , killed . I felt desperate , until by chance a professor from the University of Shiraz came up here : a very noble and learned man . He inspired hope and confidence in me . He told me he // was sure that the oppression would end soon , that the chiefs would lose their power , that the peasants would be freed , and no longer subjugated to injustice , violence , and extortion . He wanted to find a way to prevent the exploitation of the people by the money-lenders of the towns . Although he came from a princely family himself , he behaved entirely differently from our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , considerate . His visit was like a revelation for me . I saw the light . Later , he sent me a book , Crime and Punishment , by Dostoevski . When I read it , I understood that he wanted to show me that people like us existed elsewhere , too , and that there is hope for change . In a way I felt like Raskolnikov , the hero of the book , myself . While the chiefs stood for raiding and oppression , I stood for security , peace , respect for life , the Shah , development , the ending of oppression . To the children in school I talked this way , too . I told them what the state , the nation , and the law is and that the chiefs had no right to do what they did . Of course , people informed the chiefs about it and they tried to silence me . One of them sent his men and had me carried off to his village . Hands and feet in chains ? like in the Khan 's castle some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine days , until several influential men persuaded the chief to set me free . How do you see life in the village now ? Now it is much better . There is education , security , agriculture , a water pipeline has been built . People work much harder now that they feel safe . Formerly , I did n't work as much as I do now . You never were sure what the chiefs would do to your garden , to your crop . Still , the dispute between the people and the landlords has not yet been settled . But there is no doubt that the right is with the people . They cleared the fields , they planted the crops . The landlords came afterwards and claimed the land by sheer force . Also , the people are still exploited by the money-lenders and traders of the towns . The tribes have been ruined by the urban traders . A loan corporation would be needed to end that . Maybe four or five years from now one will be established . Also , many of the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suggestions from us villagers are consistently ignored . For example , small factories should be established locally for meat freezing , hide processing , dairy products , carpet weaving , fruit canning , and brick manufacture . But enormous sums are spent instead on some project or the other we do n't see the need for , and after some time it turns out that it has been a mistake . Ever since our water pipeline and the public faucets were built almost two years ago , I wanted to pipe water into my house . I am ready to bring a // professional plumber from the town and pay for everything , and , as you see , I have already done most of the digging . But the Development-Corps man and his agency still have n't approved it . They say that first twenty or thirty people must be ready to pay fifty percent of the costs of their private lines , then the government would contribute the other fifty percent , and then the pipes would be installed . It 's all words . It 's a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , dismissed my class recently because I was busy with the wedding at my neighbor 's . I had a pretext for a play with power , so I used it , and the students liked it , too . Similarly , a lot of politics is involved in the employment of teachers . Recently , a teacher for adult education was appointed who is illiterate ! At the anniversary celebrations of the White Revolution ( 6 Bahman ) you announced that you would donate ten suits to poor children . Do you give them away in the way of God or in the way of the Shah ? The Shah is the means of God . God works through the Shah , as He works through any shah . Without a shah there would be nothing in Iran . Sure , other countries have different forms of government and it is all right for them , but in Iran there probably would be anarchy without a shah . In the same way as God gives us this Shah , and in the same way as the Shah gives to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give a very tiny bit . I bought ten boy-scout uniforms and sent them to boys of poor families , but in such a way that they did not know the suits were coming from me . Good deeds are better if the recipient does not know the donor . Otherwise , a relationship of gratitude and dependence may be created , or the donor may derive a reputation from something that was not meant to serve that purpose . Is n't it a great burden for the peasants to send their children to school ? Very much so . Many of them have n't even gotten their daily bread and yet pay for a boy in high school . Some are sending one boy to school while employing another as a shepherd . That 's unjust . A father must give the same chance to every child and he ought not look at his own interest . If he can at all afford it and the son has the ability , he must pay for his education . Otherwise the boy becomes his enemy later on . The father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiring his son out as a shepherd for a piece of bread and so destroying the future of the child . I eat only simple food , and the trouble I take in tending the gardens and keeping the animals I take only for the children . They are the goal . To pay for their education is the weight on my chest . For my son in the tribal secondary school I was ready to pay a fee of 2200 toman ? or anything ? if only he got accepted . But money did not decide , only performance . After // he had passed the exam , they told me I need only pay 1100 toman . I offered to pay 1000 toman more so that they could admit a student whose family does not have the money . They declined , but I heard them talking about it in the hall , and one of them asked me where I was from . When I told him , he was greatly amazed since , he said , about the tribes he had known only that they were thieves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return here after his studies ? If he wo n't it will be a mistake and my education was a failure . He ought to make his skills available to the people here . If there wo n't be a position for him to use his abilities , he must create one . After all , I did the same when I became a teacher . And he must work with the people ? not like these officials who never leave the administrative center . They could equally well sit in Tehran . The veterinarian , for example , ought to travel around and inspect our animals regularly . By the time we see that they are sick and call him in and he eventually arrives , it is too late . You talk about evolution in class . Is n't it in conflict with what the religion says ? To me it appears more likely to be true . What is said in the Hadithor wherever it is ? namely , that they gathered a handful of earth from all over the world and built a human body out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? it does not make sense . Now that we know better , we must say that this was said only on the basis of a certain wisdom . The writer had some insight ? not that he knew as we know , though ? but he could not bring forth the evidence for it the way it is possible now . He said it in this form so that people would believe . For example , in the Hadith is the rule of the Prophet that defecating into water is sinful . He knew that there is some thing , some active force in dirty water which causes people to get sick . But he did not have the means ? like the microscope , for example ? to make this evident . What does this mean for the mullahs ? Well , the descendants of those mullahs of the past must turn around now . Their beliefs must change . For example , my father , whom I did not know because he died when I was two or three years old , he may have held certain beliefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as superstitions . If , let 's assume , the mullahs in his time said that the world rests on the horn of a bull , he believed it . But I can not agree with this . I rather see it as a superstition . There is clear evidence . Books are written about it . Astronomy , geography , mathematics tell us how it is . I have more faith in these books than in the accounts of the mullahs. // The children who go to school learn a better religion now . The religion is better now ? at least in certain regards ? than in former times because it is purer : the superstition has been taken out of it . In the past , for example , the mullahs said that it was forbidden ( haram ) to build foreign factories in Iran . This would remove the people from the religion , they said , yet they declared it permissible to buy finished goods from abroad . Another superstition is the belief that one can remove one 's sins with a special prayer , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " But what one has done , he has done . The only thing that counts is his behavior from now onwards . There were also ? and still are ? people who had their corpse taken to Karbala because they believed that in this way their sins would be forgiven . It is also a superstition if one , for example , falls from the roof and believes that this was the decree of God , that it has been written on his forehead . After all , one has eyes , and one should think . Some of these superstitions ? like the one regarding the factories ? have been spread by mullahs who were brainwashed in England , Iraq , America , to spread them here so that the foreign countries could sell their expensive goods to us and Iran would not start producing them . It was a strategy of foreign countries to make Iran weak . Superstition is everything that damages or impairs the economy of the country . The veiling of women , for example , is a detriment because if a woman has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . Also , superstition is everything that weakens the faith in the Shah . Like all the spokes of an umbrella converge onto the " pillar " in the center , and without a pillar there would be no umbrella , so Iran could not exist without a shah . How , do you think , did evolution work ? I think that the radiation of the sun was involved . The light which emanates from the sun in the form of rays consists of particles which are life-creating . These particles of sunlight fused with the decaying preceding existences to create higher forms of existence . In this way life developed in the sea , moved onto the land , forests emerged and decayed , and so on , until finally an animal called Man emerged . I do n't know how this happened in detail , but because we know that we need the light of the sun to live , it is evident that some portion of these particles of sunlight become part of my body , and this plant , and that animal . What again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ? this I do not know . Will you know it after death ? I do n't know . Certainly I believe in hell and heaven : " Heaven " stands for a world of peace and pleasure ; " hell " for a world of misery ? here or // there , what difference does it make ? A number of people say that paradise is where there is well-being . Life after death , this is just a word . My belief is that , for instance , the soul . . . the soul . . . so to speak ? that 's the way we say it , I do n't know ? the soul . . . exists . It is something that urges you to do something . Now , how this is , and where it is , and where it goes , and where it comes from ? this we do n't know . What happens after death , we just do n't know . But in hell and heaven I do believe . Be that now for keeping order in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for whatever , I believe in it . We have a game here , a trick we play on a road companion . When we pass a big rock , we say to him , " This rock is muffling all sound . However loudly I shout you wo n't hear me behind it . " If the other is simple-minded , he will believe it . He will go behind the rock and while I walk away , he will think that I am yelling and yelling and that the rock stops him from hearing it . And when he finally comes around , he sees nobody . This is the way our minds are tied up . We do n't know what really is there . They say paradise is a pleasant place with flowers and gardens and houris ? that 's laughable ? a place of pleasure . Pleasure ! Whatever pleasure we find right here ? that is paradise . Whatever trouble and distress we experience here , that is the World of Hell for us . Yes , it is right here in this world : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good here , it is heaven . If it is bad for us , it is our hell . And then ? By God , I do n't know . Man is weak , he ca n't know . Neither can the mullahs . We can not see into these things . I think about them , but I am not getting anywhere . So I say with everybody else , " paradise ? ' However it may be , the notion of hell invokes fear . Since most people act morally out of fear , it disciplines them . But if a wronged person forgives his offender , just as a judge is satisfied , I think , God , too , would have no business anymore . All these ideas are my own . I do n't want to interfere with the beliefs of others , but there are many things I just ca n't see , such as that the breastbeating and weeping in Muharram should be of any use . I think this way : If I greet you , it has a meaning . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured that in everything ? words , thoughts , and deeds ? I am safe for you ! " If then I did something evil to you nevertheless , it would be inconsistent . Thus , to exclaim " Ali " ought to mean that you should be like Ali , that you should acquire Ali 's qualities . To love Ali and Husayn means to be brave and valorous like them ? but not to weep . This is of no use . Do you think that God punishes in this world ? Yes , I believe that punishment comes in this world . But for us it is a // problem why my child should be miserable because I did some evil . I think it is like this : the evil deeds of a person accumulate like water poured into a glass . As water overflows a full glass , so the misdeeds of a person spill over into the next generation . Also , it has to do with inheritance . My son is innocent , but just as he is the heir of my possessions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my deeds , too . There are many such cases in the village . That 's the way I think ? not that I have proof for it , though . What is the meaning of religion ? Religion means to do good . It means what Zarathustra said : " Think good , speak good , do good . " Faith is the very belief in good actions , such as not to harm anybody . All religions of the world say this . But beyond that , our knowledge , our information is deficient . We ca n't see why it is so , why it is good . It is as if we had a veil in front of our eyes . We do n't know . The regulations of the religion mean the same . Is n't the meaning of the prayers that we ought to do good , that we should obtain our bread by our own work and not by violating the rights of others ? There are some who make the ablutions , say the prayers , and so on ? all very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their prayers are worthless . What matters are the deeds . How do you explain such behavior ? Above all , our early education is rotten . If I am not good , for sure my child wo n't be either . Moreover , we do n't understand the prayers because we say them in a language we do n't understand . We say only the external form , so to speak . Yet we are told we must say the prayers . The Mullah even said on the pulpit that even the thief must say them . He did not say , for example , that the meaning of the prayers is that one should n't steal . He even said that if you kill seventy people , and say a certain prayer seventy times , then all your own sins and those of seven generations back on your father 's side and of seven generations back on your mother 's side will be forgiven . All this is instilled in childhood , from then onwards it exists . Certainly they say you shall not steal , but when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't steal it so that I can steal it myself . " The grapes for these raisins were not quite ripe , but since there is no discipline in the village , you have to harvest when all others harvest around you . Otherwise your crop will be destroyed , for example , by animals grazing unguarded . For some time in summer my oldest son has to sleep out in the orchard to watch it . The only way to remedy this lack of discipline is to see that a child , as he grows up , learns to do good on his own , not only on command . // What about the other regulations , such as fasting or vows ? Fasting has the same purposes . One is that the tongue , the ears , and the eyes abstain , so to speak , from evil speaking , evil hearing , and evil looking . Another aim is the cleansing of the body for our health . Last year I observed it fora while , but the eating at night did n't do me good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to do some good for another person , but otherwise . . . . Once I told a rich man in a neighboring village who was about to leave for Mecca , " Every year five or six children die in your village from the filthy drinking water . If you spent your money for building a water pipeline , it would be worth more than making the pilgrimage , even if every year only one child would be saved ? ' But others told him , " This teacher says a blasphemy ? ' So he travelled to Mecca . Vows have the same intention . If , by means of this belief , a hungry man gets bread , it 's good . Otherwise , it 's nothing . The aim of all these rules is to encourage human beings to realize humanity . The Young Teacher : Rationalism and Orthodoxy The Young Teacher is a well-respected young man in his late twenties who has been teaching elementary school for about ten years . He did not grow up with his father and got neither land nor support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides . His mother was divorced early , and in a quite unusual arrangement he grew up with her . Influenced by his very pious and religiously knowledgeable mother , the modern rational ideas he picked up as a student in the Teacher Training College became firmly embedded in the conservative moral values of traditional religion . Combined with his belief in the intrinsic good of education , these values create a paternalistic attitude towards his wife , mother , and three children , and give him the reputation of a circumspect and no-nonsense master of his house . With an as yet small family to support , his salary seems to provide him with a better than average living standard . This impression is intensified by the unusually tidy and well-kept appearance of his house . ( 1971/ 76 ) . Do the schools have an influence on the character of the people ? Potentially they could have a very great effect , but up until now I ca n't see very much of it . The reason for this is that the teachers are only transmitting knowledge ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglect to teach the children good behavior , concern for others , truthfulness , honesty , respect for elders , willingness to carry out orders ? in short , fail to give 71 // them a true education . They can not give it because they have no true education themselves , and also because the word of us teachers does n't count much in our community . This is a great shortcoming of the schools here . If it could be corrected , the character and morals of the people would gradually improve . The people here say that if a child has a bad character , it is because his parents ate unlawful food ( luqmah haram ) , that is , food obtained by stealing , oppression , and so on . But this is not true . It 's not the food that causes a bad character , but the education the child receives . Also , one 's character is not , as they say , written on one 's forehead , that is , predestined . If a child is educated well , he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will become bad , and he will have troubles later on , for a person without true education is disliked and has enemies . He may be literate and knowledgeable and even be a government official who more or less fulfills his duties , but if he lacks a true education and is , for example , abusing people , these will eventually become dissatisfied with him and refuse to follow his orders . So , a person 's fortune is influenced by his conduct ? Yes , definitely . The people here say that every person has two agents assigned to him in heaven , two angels . One of them is writing down what the person does , the other pleads for him at the court of God . This heavenly angel is called the good fortune of a person . People say that when somebody has good fortune ? many new lambs and kids , let 's say ? his agent pleaded well for him with God . When a person has ill fortune , when , as they say , his good fortune is asleep , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten his duties . I think this is nonsense . Our religion tells us that God will set things right for anyone who is doing good but that He will send evil upon a person who is doing wrong . Thus , if I do not encroach on the property of my neighbor , do not look at his wife and daughter , do not walk through his field and squash the crop , if I wish from God that he may prosper , and if I am really pleased when I see that God provides well for others ? if I have this kind of attitude , and work hard , God will undoubtedly provide well for me , too . But if I am violating the rights and property of others , if I am displeased when I see the health , happiness and prosperity of others , then God wo n't give me a good life , He wo n't give me His blessings . No matter how hard I will work , nothing will come of it and my possessions will vanish . I have seen this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Teacher Training Institute , I had a classmate who was well off . He had a father , fields , sheep and goats , a good house , everything . Then , when we came back and he took up his job he started an affair with a married woman and // took to gambling . I urged him not to do these things , but to no avail . Now he is in debt , his possessions have vanished , his life is unpleasant , his reputation is bad . Not that he simply lost his wealth in gambling ? he just has no blessing . But I had nothing , absolutely nothing . My mother provided for me by doing needlework and by weaving for others . We had one small room and , for sleeping , a small rug and one quilt under which we slept together before I went to the Teacher Training Institute . But the night I came back , I no longer could sleep beside my mother . I stayed awake all night and in the morning travelled to the town where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedding and other small things we needed . We also had debts from earlier years and then we ran up more debts because I married soon . My marriage was n't based on love . My mother was sick and lonesome , and I thought of having children soon because we did n't have anybody by way of family . Ever since things have been going well with us . As you know , I have bought land , animals , a car , and our house is well-furnished . As another example take my three uncles . When they divided up the family possessions , the two older brothers took the larger land shares , and the best from everything else , and fought with each other . But the youngest was content with whatever he got . Now God has given him a better life than the others . This I have seen myself . Fortune has nothing to do with why somebody is poor . In my view there are two possible reasons for poverty : either the person does n't understand what he has to do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things the lawful way . In this case the Lord does not give him anything because He is displeased with his attitude or because He knows that if He were to give him riches he would use them to do evil . One can not see the moral inside of a person . I may refrain from stealing only because I am afraid to do it . Since God knows that I am , in fact , a bad man ? that I am a thief at heart ? He is not providing for me , no matter what troubles I may be taking . But the people do n't know what kind of person I really am . They say , " He is a good man , but he has no good fortune . " This is not so . The poor are either lazy , or their character is bad , or their moral inside is not good . This means that people are punished for their evil deeds in this world ? For every deed , every single act a person does he will in the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next . There is no doubt about this . But in my opinion punishment is being exacted mainly in this world . Certainly , there is also the next world , but the point is that in this world we actually see it happening . Indeed , the fact that we can witness the punish74 Islam in Practice ment of evil-doers in this world is one of the evidences for the existence of the other world . But I do not believe that God punishes somebody for the sins of his father , which is what people mean when they say , " The father sows , the son reaps . " There is one thing though : children will pick up the evil habits of their parents and so become themselves liable to do wrong and get punished for it . This is the true meaning of this saying . Nor do I believe that a person can get his sins forgiven by doing repentance . Every evil he commits he has to pay back . Or should he be able to do all kinds of things and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh God , I repent " ? No . But these mullahs were a bad kind of people , liars , thieves , adulterers ? everything . Such a character would go to a person and say , " You have done all these evil deeds ... you must repent them ... in the Qur'an it is written .... I will put the words of repentance into your mouth . " He would say something in Arabic for the person to repeat , words the latter would n't understand ? in fact , he would n't even know what Arabic is ? and then say , " This was your repentance . Now go , God will forgive you . " And he would receive a fee . The whole thing was a trick they played on the people to get money . What about the requital in the next world ? After a person has died , it is said , he will first be questioned in the grave , in the same way as when the gendarmerie is making an inquiry . If , for example , two people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , put everything on record , and send the file to the court . In the meantime , the one who has been beaten up and is innocent will be told to go home and take it easy till things are ready for court proceedings . But the guilty person will be locked up in a bad place , maybe even beaten , until he is sent to court . In the grave it is the same way . First they come and do the questioning . Then , if he has been a good man , they will give him a comfortable place and tell him to stay there in peace and happiness until he would receive the reward for his deeds . If he has been an evil-doer , they will ... I do n't know ... it is said they will put him up with snakes and dogs in a tight , bad place till the day that is said to last for 50,000 years will come and he will receive his punishment . The mullahs are saying this wrong . They say that this day will come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has existed for millions of years . Rather , that day itself from morning till sunset will last as long as 50,000 years . On that day all the dead of the world will be summoned to be judged . All the good and bad deeds will be weighed . If the former weigh more , the person will go to heaven ; if the latter weigh more , he will go to hell . // So sins can be redeemed by a proportionate amount of good deeds ? No , no , there is no such thing . Evil deeds can not be redeemed ; they have to be atoned for . For his sins a person will be punished and for his good deeds he will be rewarded ; good and evil deeds will be requited separately . It is also said that on the Day of judgment the sins of the people will be forgiven for the sake of the blood of the Imam Husayn . This is a lie . Should the Imam have sacrificed himself for the profit of evil-doers ? If this were so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time have become Muslims to have their sins redeemed in an easy way . What do you then consider part of the true religion ? Not to lie , not to steal , not to slander , to give help when you see someone in misery ? this is what I understand as religion , and what I want to teach my children . I believe that a person who is abiding by this wo n't fare badly on the Day of Judgment . As to saying the prayers , that 's nothing special , that 's something we do every day as a matter of course just as eating . The fasting is good , too . Its purpose is said to be , for one thing , that by going hungry , one experiences the sufferings of the hungry , feels pity , and is moved to help the poor , and , for another , that it betters one 's health . I agree to this ; it is true . But I get ill when I am fasting . I fasted in earlier years , but quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muharram celebration , when you put your hand on your chest , call the feat of the Imam Husayn to your mind and for what sake he did it , and your heart is filled with compassion for the Imam , that 's the right meaning of the mourning for Husayn , and that is what I am telling my children . I do not want them to go to the mosque and stay awake all night beating their chests . The chest beating has no good reason , it is not in the Qur'an . Once in the mosque a gendarme wanted me to take off my shirt and join in the breast beating . I refused and he became angry and a fight arose . I left and never went there again . Shall I go there and watch things , like in a show ? Some of it is outrightly absurd , such as the women who go there to see the bodies of men , and young men who bare their chests and beat themselves madly because they want to make an impression on the women and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original religion , but not to what the mullahs say , not to the kind of religion that consists in going to the mosque and sitting there , with prayer beads in hand , to see what the mullah has to say , while at home one 's wife and children are in need of food and clothing ; or saying twenty units of prayer instead of the regular four and doing additional fastings but robbing one 's neighbor should the opportunity arise . I do n't like this kind of religion . In fact , most of the people I have seen // perform rituals in overly devout ways did so to cover up some evil , in the same way as I would use a thousand devious words to hoodwink a person I robbed without his knowledge . What about vows and written prayers ? I do no longer believe in vows . Five years ago I still promised onefourth of the offspring of my mare to the Imam Husayn if she foaled all right . But now I would rather say that helping a brother or cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a kind of vow , and I do n't believe any is better . Nevertheless , I did make the pilgrimage to Mashhad recently , but more so because I had to take my mother there who , when I was a child , had made a vow to make the pilgrimage when I would be grown-up . People even used to make vows like saying , " Oh Imamzadah so-andso , one hand of this child shall be dedicated to you , so that he may grow up hale and well , " and then , every year , bring one-fourth of the boy 's estimated earnings , that is , the equivalent of one hand , to that Imamzadah . Worse yet , they would even give a daughter as an offering to an Imamzadah , that is , give her in marriage to one of his descendants without asking for a bride price . This is , of course , very wrong . She is a human being and has a right to her own life and future . But people did these things because they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their landlords , afflicted with innumerable diseases , had no doctor . So they took recourse to these things . As to the written prayers , I think they are effective only if one believes very strongly in them . For someone who has doubts , like myself , they are useless . I do , however , approve of the damband against a wolf . Just recently I had one made for one of my cows that got lost . Of course , I could make it myself , too , but we believe that God approves of it more if it is made by the descendant of an Imam . What about the other things people believe here ? The people here do not have much education or reason or wisdom . When suffering some harm or distress , they do not say that it was brought about by nature . Instead , they resort to all kinds of explanations . When , for example , a child dies , they do n't say that he had not been taken care of in a proper , hygienic way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a curse on him , or because the harvest of a wheat field was navaruzi , that is , beyond the limits of the ordinary . These things have not been proven . They are just said . Or when a rash appears on the skin of a child , people will take him to somebody who , they believe , has received the gift from the jinn to heal this // disease by spreading his saliva over it . This is , of course , also nonsense . It may be possible though that this kind of rash can be soothed by saliva . I do , however , believe in the custom to wait a while before going someplace if someone just sneezed . Not that this were written anywhere or that it were really true that sneezing portends evil . Rather , I think , the effect is due to the strong belief that has been attached to this . As to good and bad dreams , in earlier years I believed in them and gave alms to the poor to ward off the evil when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do no longer think it 's true . Neither do I believe ? in fact I never did ? in auspicious and inauspicious days . Every day is as good as any other to accomplish some work . Such beliefs have nothing to do with religion : they are propagated by the mullahs . The mullahs can write whatever they want ? there is nobody to prevent them ? and call it risalah , a treatise , a book of religious rules . Then a mullah goes to a peasant here , an uneducated , plain , simple , upright man who has worked hard all his life and tells him , " I have seen it written in the risalah that you will die or God will send His wrath on your children if you do not give me a goat . " And the peasant gives him a goat . It is all superstition and lies . Take our Mullah . He wears this Arab cloak , talks much about religion , preaches to the people , and so on . Why is he doing this ? To draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit vendor : the more he advertises his goods and the more excited he gets about them , the more customers he will have to profit from . If the Mullah were hired today by a government office , he would dress up with a neat shirt and a crease in his trousers and talk no longer about the religion at all . Do you approve of artificial birth control ? Someone who believes in the religion and in God will say that killing a child , a sperm a night old in the womb of the mother ? which is what the pill is doing ? is the same thing as killing a grown-up person ; it is murder . If the Lord wants to give children to somebody , He will give . If He does n't want to give , He wo n't give . If He wants to give few , He will give few . If He wants to give many , He will give many . Birth control means to interfere with the order of God . Therefore , I think it is not good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The natural way is better . Yes , they say that bearing many children is n't good for a woman . But again , I believe that if God wants to keep a woman well and healthy , He can do so no matter how many children she is bearing . But if He does n't want to , she will become ill even if she does n't bear any children at all . There are now many women in this village who were perfectly healthy , but have become ill since taking the pill . It is obviously not good . The Craftsman : Modernist Purism The Craftsman , who is from a large , well-respected local peasant family , is in his late fifties now . As a young man in the 1930 's he had stayed in Tehran for several years , where he acquired some skills in carpentry . These now make him the most professional carpenter in the village . Although he does own some land , he considers himself a craftsman rather than a peasant . For this reason and also because he has hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and from his brothers he is separated by discord ? he devotes most of his time to his craft while his agricultural activity is rather low-keyed . He does not make use of all his land , little as it is , and he does not operate a herding outpost , partly because he does not have enough animals to make this necessary or even feasible , but mainly because he thinks it would be wrong to involve his children in herding and thereby to deprive them of schooling . Although he had no chance to go to school , he taught himself to read and write . His literacy , the experiences in Tehran and a lifelong lively interest in intellectual matters and the world at large make him a knowledgeable and highly individualistic man , and a kind of non-conformist who likes to keep to himself . Most days he can be seen working in his simple workshop , fashioning with relentless diligence window sashes , doors , baking boards , baby cribs , and agricultural tools with his partially self-made hand tools . Rarely is he seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting places , nor does he socialize much at other occasions . Despite his diligence , however , his living standard is low . He does manage to support his oldest son in secondary school in town , but only with great difficulty , and what remains for himself , his wife , and his other five children is bare survival . Especially his non-involvement in village affairs makes him politically weak and vulnerable to transgressions by more dynamic villagers . I le // claims that his brothers usurped part of his inheritance , an accusation they refute by saying that he had been loafing around for years , totally neglecting his land , and that therefore the fields he now owns must be considered a gift they gave him . ( 1971 ) . What is the meaning of life ? The meaning of life is to recognize God 's power and His greatness . Man was made to admire the works of God , such as the change of the seasons or that a tree branch planted in the ground begins to sprout . God has established all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have made this plane once and since then it works for me as a plane . Religion for me is the knowledge of God , the knowledge that God is the being which has greater power than all other beings ; that He is the power which can make something out of nothing and nothing out of something ; that He has created us and He will kill us again , and that therefore we must behave in a way that pleases Him so that He may be merciful to us and ease our life in this world and in the other world may forgive us so that we may fare well ; and that we must not do evil , so as not to incur His wrath . If I stole something , for example , or said a lie , then for sure God would become angry and send down misfortune on me . This , to me , is religion . But what they say about wine and the veiling and the chest beating is without substance , for it is not written in any book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor in the Book of Abraham , nor in the Psalms , nor in the Qur'an . Religion means that man worships God , not that man worships man . Therefore , I wo n't worship anything manmade . Only God , who is the power , the force that created us , is worthy of worship . A Pakistani , Muhammad Ali Igbal , in his White Book , said : I did not see a dog before a dog to bow its head . It is from blindness man did render slave himself to man . That means , everybody must think for himself to find the truth , like Jesus , or Muhammad , or Abraham , or Moses , or all the other prophets . They found it , so you will find it , too . Why should you need those mullahs ? Only a blind man has to follow others . Open your eyes yourself , and see the good , and see the evil , and do n't do the evil , but do good ? so that you , too , become Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // For what reasons do you do good to others ? I know God to be the One who causes dry grains to become green wheat , to grow to a certain height , and to yield ten man for every man of seed . God does not need us to kill a chicken , His own creature , for him to be pleased . Rather , we make offerings out of kindness by way of charity , in the way of God . If someone has and another has not , then the one who has must give to the other . Especially if somebody has much he should share it . For example , if one has a rich harvest , he should slaughter an animal and distribute the meat among his neighbors , so that they wo n't become envious , but become his friends . This is the old Iranian religion . But I do n't approve of offerings to be made as vows , for example , by saying , " Oh God , give me this or that , then I will give something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief that a person will be carried to paradise if he makes such offerings or will be damned if he does not . I do believe that God gives blessings . He gives blessings to your possessions if you share them with others . He does not give them in return for the animal you killed . Rather , God is pleased by my sharing and so He may give me a good harvest , good health , and keep away misfortune . And this is what I wish from God : well-being and lawful possessions . Whenever I sow a field I say , " God , you are powerful , and I am powerless , give blessings to this seed , so that I wo n't become a thief . " If God does not give His blessings , one 's possessions will decrease . Why are people doing evil things ? It is said that the devil deceives and misleads people , but this is not true . People do evil things for two reasons . First , for lack of a livelihood : if somebody is hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire and greed : if somebody has nothing , he wants a donkey , if he has a donkey , he wants a mule , then a horse , then a truck . And he desires status and power to dominate others . So when people lie , it is either because they are poor or because of politics . But it is not true that Iranians lie more than other peoples , as some say . By and large , the people of this village are bad . There are so many quarrels between brothers . If people want to increase their crops they should clear their own fields of stones rather than plow into the field of their neighbor . Take this man who came here yesterday to persuade me of his rights in the dispute he has with some others . He lied . He lied by the Hazrat-i Abbas so that his lies might pass as the truth . Of course , there are always two views in a dispute ? as in the case of Genghis Khan . When they told him that future generations will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I have purified the world with blood . " But people must tell a man that his perception of a case is mistaken ? to do so has merit and to // neglect doing it is sinful . This man knows he is in the wrong . There are witnesses . But the people can not persuade him to acknowledge it and make peace . Maybe you will be here still when God sends him a misfortune . My own brother who has stolen part of my land even goes to the mosque so that people may say he is innocent . The devil comes in disguise , and therefore one should not shake hands with everybody . For what reasons do n't you do evil things yourself ? It is for fear of God . I fear God . I fear that God would send me misfortune if I did something evil as , for example , eat the property of others , or be untrustworthy , that is , not return something I was entrusted with . For example , whenever I find something , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the owner may come and get it . I would be ashamed of evil deeds on the Day of Judgment . Also , I could not walk around freely and raise my head among the people . I would have to be ashamed and hide myself . Believers are those who do n't lie and do n't steal , those who fear that God may send a misfortune : disease , or pain , or death ; those who wo n't go into a garden to steal , fearing that God may make a snake bite them from a bush if they did so . The religion exists for the purpose that people have fear . If there was no religion , everything would fall to pieces . I call God the Great Judge who has everything in his hands : to give life and to take life , to give possessions and to take possessions , to send disease and to take away disease ? it is all in the hands of the Great Judge . A wicked life He will punish . Evil and ill-fortune in this world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who really knows that a sick person has no sins ? If , however , a truly innocent person suffers some illfate , like poverty , then it is his own fault . He should do something about it , like work in a city where he earns more . On the other hand , well-being may be seen as a reward from God . God is like the master of a good and bad servant . He will be pleased with the good one and praise him and reward him , but punish the bad one . About an evil-doer we say , " Eventually God will send him misfortune . " It really has happened . There are many here who were robbers and now are very poor . Our Former Landlord did a lot of evil , and now look at him , in what misery he lives . But then his innocent son will go hungry , too . Is n't this unjust of God ? We say , " The father sows , the son reaps ; ' that is , every poor son is poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not unjust . The father 's semen was unlawful ( haram ) because of his misdeeds , and therefore the son must suffer ; so that I am aware that if I act like this man my son will become like his son , and that I must act better . // What about punishment in hell , what about paradise ? I 'll tell you after I have been there . . . . I do n't harm anybody and so I need not be afraid of anybody , not even of God . Those will go to hell who have to be afraid already in this world because they did harm to others . But none of this will be really known until that time . In the meantime , as I have said , the punishment takes place already here . One villager was the greatest robber around here . Now his sons do n't want to support him any longer and recently one of his grandsons threw a stone at him that blinded one eye . This man is in hell right now . And our Former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remission of sins ? All this is a lie : that sins will be forgiven by special prayers , or a pilgrimage , or fasting , or repentance , or by the blood of Husayn . If this were true one could steal a lot and then make a pilgrimage and it would be forgiven . Or , for example , when people steal from a garden and say , " We will fast to get rid of this sin " ? is this possible ? The mullahs tell them this . They tell them to do anything they want and then say , " Repentance ! " to be forgiven . Take the case of another villager . He brought home three or four huge cooking pots and other stuff from a raid and gave something to our little Mullah who made it all lawful ! Nevertheless , this man is burdened with the debt now , and on the Day of Judgment the rightful owner will get his property back from him , we say . But it is the mullahs ' fault if the people 's faith gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mullahs and so he will steal again . This is wrong . The Prophet said , " Cut off every hand that has stolen ! " But our Mullah says , " Come , I will make it lawful for you . " They say that the Imam Husayn drank the Cup of Suffering and for this has received the privilege of interceding for the sinners . This is nonsense . He was a man , a good one though , in his attempt to fight for the rights of the people . But if he could not defend himself , how can he help me ? If it were true , the Westerners , who can go to the moon , already would have come a long time ago and carried away all of Karbala for their own profits . Even if they should hold a knife to my throat , I wo n't say that Husayn will hasten to my help after death . He ca n't do it . He was a man like all others . To shed tears over him avails him and us as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his blood , which was shed on the plain of Karbala , will wash away the sins of the believers . But this is a lie ; it is neither in the Qur'an nor in the Hadith . He was killed in a family dispute , a fight over land and water , that 's all . To weep about this is meaningless . Besides , according to the Law itself , Husayn 's death was justified because it was the Imams who started the war . The story is told that once , in a battle , Ali // killed one thousand men ! Because of these killings the Imams were liable to be killed , too . The Qur'an says , " A head for a head , a nose for a nose . " So their death conforms to the Qur'an , the Law , nothing else . So , the mullahs are corrupting the religion ? They impose upon the people . They want to swindle them of money . Take our Mullah , for example . How many times a day does he cut off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for five or ten toman ? They tell us , " Take this road to go to heaven ; " but they themselves are n't taking it . The Mullah takes ten toman on every ten toman he lends , but he keeps telling us that it is unlawful to take interest ! And then this Mullah tells me , " Make your possessions lawful and pay the khums ! " So I am to saw this tree-trunk into boards and with pains earn one toman ? only to pay him a fifth of it ? All their possessions are unlawful ! If the religion of Muhammad ever was good , then those surely have corrupted it , those mullahs ! The people followed them because they were afraid of them . The mullahs were allies of the landlords ? our Landlord even forced us to fast ? and so they had power . They also could be bribed . They would take bribes from both sides and then use their influence in favor of the one who gave more . I do n't agree with what they say . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and there is also a picture of it ? that the Imam Ali struck his sword at a certain Khaybari with such force that it split him and his horse in two . When God saw that even the earth would be split into halves , He sent Gabriel to hold his wing under the sword , but the sword cut through his wing , too , and through seven layers of the earth . And this should be true ? It 's impossible ! The mullahs say this , not the religion ! But when I say so they call me an unbeliever . And those dervishes and Sayyids ! Did you see these two dervishes with their painted screen depicting scenes of Karbala today ? They are imposters . They recite the events of Karbala and handle a snake to show how blessed they are ? which is ridiculous . In the city they could n't do this , but here they collect money for it . People gave them money so that the Imams would intercede for them on the Day of Judgment . It is stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and need no Imams . And I do n't approve of those begging Sayyids , either , who imagine themselves higher and better than the villagers . Their religion is of no value whatsoever . They should work . Once I was working in another village and such a Sayyid came . He was invited into the house , but when he was offered the waterpipe he declined and asked for cigarettes instead . The people told him they did n't have any . So the son of this Sayyid went outside and // after a while started to shout , " Oh , Oh , the Imam sent us cigarettes ! " With this trick they wanted to impress the people and cheat them out of their property . I took a stick and chased them away . I can tell you many stories of this sort . One day a Sayyid came along begging for bread and a place to stay . So I invited him . At night he got up and left , taking my shoes along with him . Such are the descendants of our Prophet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is now called the House of God , the Kaaba , an idol temple ? It was we who were worshipping God ! It was we who had the places of worship . We had temples in which God and Jesus and others were perpetually venerated . Also , the moral rules , the knowledge , the science was ours . History says that when the Arabs conquered Iran , they fired the bathhouses of Arabestan with the books from our libraries for seventy years ! Then they brought us the Qur'an . Now , when I say I have a headache , the mullahs , instead of telling me to go to the doctor and get a medicine say , " We will write a prayer , tie it to your head , and you will get well . " Is this possible ? Of course it is not . We had to accept it because they were our conquerors . At first the Iranians defeated them . Shapur , one of our kings , killed and killed and killed the Arabs until he was persuaded to stop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that they could not strike a sword any longer . But then the Arabs subjugated us and brought this over us . By the Messiah , by God , I am welldisposed towards all Europeans and ill-disposed towards the Arabs because the Europeans did n't harm us , but the Arabs did . The Twelve Imams too ? About the Twelve Imams I say if they were good men , God may have mercy on them . But it 's not so that they can do me any good or that I can do them any good . They were men and they are dust now , and they just ca n't make , for example , a sick person well again . And if I beat my chest , shall this be good for them ? So I am saying , " God have mercy on them . " Likewise , to those who say , " Umar be damned ! " I say , " Do n't say that so that they wo n't say Ali be damned ' either ! " I have nothing against the Sunni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other religions too ? Certainly , I do n't say that Islam is more true or better than other religions . It 's not until the Day of Judgment ? if it exists ? that we will know . Then I will say to whoever will be the superior , " You are the king . " Do we know who will be king ? No . So what 's the use of us beating each other up over this now ? Besides , it is known that part of the Qur'an is from the Gospel . How can one approve of the Qur'an then , but not of the GosThe // pel ? When I say such things , our Mullah calls me an unbeliever . But I accept everything in the Qur'an that 's from God . Only what is not from Him , the man-made stories , I do not accept , like the one that God made man out of dust . This was n't so . It was just as a chicken comes from an egg : a natural process by the order of God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It serves to show submission to God , and to remember Him , the Creator , the force which brought us into existence . It 's also healthy . But one can not base a claim on it , as many people do . They believe that if they say the prayers , castles will be built for them , that on the Day of Judgment they can claim something by saying , " We said the prayers , we have beaten our chests for Husayn ! " I know that there is absolutely nothing to this claim . Why ? Because nobody came back from there who could have testified . It 's only the words of the mullahs , words they say to gain an income . Likewise , it is absolutely meaningless to say the prayers if one 's behavior is evil , if one has , for example , eaten someone else 's property or been untrustworthy , which I consider the gravest offences . But the prayers are good . I say them every day . I disapprove of the fact , though , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks as if he was equal to God . Are you observing the Fasting ? No . Formerly I did , but now I ca n't anymore . And anyway , its real meaning is to fast with the eyes and the tongue , and to do so always . The eyes should be blind , that is , one should not look at another 's wife ; and the tongue should be dumb , that is , one should not talk badly about other people . If this is n't done , abstaining from food is of no value . God does not approve of such fasting . Fasting is also a matter of health , and also a matter of something Shah Salah al-Din of Iran ? or was it Shah Hushang ? ? has said . In his time there was a drought , and he said , " Whoever eats three meals a day eat only two and give one to those who have none ! " Now we do this , too . At the end of the Month of Fasting we give a special alms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have less than we do ? but not to the Sayyids . Even if one is not fasting , he must give it . But most people , deceived by the mullahs , are perverting it . They are fasting without giving anything to the poor . They believe that one who dies while fasting will go straight to paradise . I believed it , too , when I was young . Once I was bitten by a snake in the Month of Fasting . My foot swelled up horribly and people wanted me to drink milk that would draw the poison out from my blood . But I refused , believing I would go directly to paradise if I died ! Such nonsense ! // What about the Muharram celebrations ? They are nonsense , too , at least the mourning , the chest beating , weeping , the sitting around smoking cigarettes , chatting , and gossiping . I do not participate in that . As I have said , it 's of no use ? neither to the Imam , nor to us . Rather , we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The day of Ashura , when they killed the Imam Husayn , was about 1300 years ago . But these mourning celebrations did not exist until about 700 years ago . Then a certain Amir who was on good terms with the group of Arabs who followed the Imams propagated them in Iran to show his allegiance to this group . He wanted to do something to attain a place in paradise . The mullahs fabricated these things for their own profit . Our mullah here got 170 toman every day during the past Muharram celebrations for going from one congregation to another and cutting off the head of the Imam Husayn . Does it earn merit to make a pilgrimage ? No , it does n't . Instead , one should give the money to the poor . A story tells that once 600,000 people made the pilgrimage to Mecca , but God approved no one 's . He did , however , approve of the pilgrimage of a man who never made it . This man had given all the money he had set aside for the pilgrimage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sitting beside the road , in her misery roasting a piece of a dead donkey . Similarly , to travel to Mashhad is not a sign of true believing . Most travel there only for the honor of being called " Mashhadi " afterwards . These people have debts and should pay them off first . Besides , they possibly do some evil afterwards and then will swear " by the road I went " that they did n't do it . Sa'di said that even a camel that went to Mecca is a Hajji . It earns merit , however , to help in the building of a bathhouse , for example , because this is a charitable work . It is for the benefit of the public . Did you attend the fatihah khvani ( prayer for the dead ) for the boy who was killed yesterday ? No . But here at home I said it for him . Why should I go there ? Does he perhaps come personally to receive the fatihah ? If the fatihah reaches anything at all , then it will reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exists ? from any place I say it . What does it do for the dead ? Will sins be forgiven ? No . If this was so , one could do any bad thing . It 's only to console the living , his father and mother . People come to their house and say , " Let 's say // a fatihah so that his soul will be happy . " It 's like this : After you have left this village , we 'll say whenever we speak of you , " Blessed be his memory ! " Will this be of any use to you over there in your country ? " Blessed be his memory " we say regarding a living person ; " God have mercy " we say for a dead one . But his relatives do n't know you said the fatihah here alone ; so why did you say it ? Well , it 's a custom ? like , when we pass by a graveyard we say , " Oh , people of yonder , the Judgment is near ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter telling us that the Day of Judgment will come soon ? It is a custom , a local custom . What do you think of the other prescriptions ? The wine they forbade because it was something we Iranians had and we had given the Arabs a lot of troubles earlier . But wine is good . I drank it , too ? yet I did n't lie and I did n't harm people . Eating the meat of boars , snakes , bears , and so on has been made unlawful because it is too dangerous to hunt these animals . The washing of the dead is , of course , for hygienic reasons . The veiling of women is not based on the religion : the mullahs say that . Aisha , Zaynab , and Shahrbanu fought battles , riding on horseback . Could they have been veiled ? Also , that girls should n't go to school , as the mullahs say , is wrong . What is the correct behavior for girls and women ? A woman should stay around the house , do her work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diligent , not sit with strangers so that these wo n't seduce her ? as it has happened recently , as you know . She must not associate with just anybody , only with her own people , for her own safety . She must not be out alone after dark because it may happen . . . . There are all sorts of men ! But all this does n't mean that a woman is lower than a man . A woman likes to have a husband who provides a livelihood for her because she is weak . But to tell the women to wear a veil , to sit in the back of the mosque , to walk at the end of the procession ? that 's wrong , that 's a lie . The religion does not say that . What about the evil eye ? If a very beautiful thing gets damaged , people say , " It 's the evil eye , go to the mullah to have a prayer written ? ' Or these beads around the neck of my young son : this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a lie . Is n't everything that happens the wish of God ? By coincidence though , certain things do happen . Once , in Tehran , a motorcyclist harassed us . A person said , " Let 's give him the evil eye ! By // God , look how fast he is going ! " The moment he said it , the cyclist was lifted up as if by an invisible hand and was thrown onto the road . People say that a certain villager , who died recently , had the evil eye . Once he even said to his own cow , " Look , how fat the cow has become ! " and it dropped dead . They say , it 's in his family , it 's in their nature . But it is not true that it happens inevitably , as people say . Otherwise one would need no hammer to smash rocks in the fields . One only had to say something by way of the evil eye and the rock would shatter . It is possible to talk about coincidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such does not exist . Do written prayers ( du'a ' ) have any effect ? No , the prayer-writing is a fraud . As I have said , the Arabs burned our books and then brought us these prayers instead . God gives and takes life and health according to His wish , and these prayers have absolutely no bearing on it . It may happen , for example , that one gets a prayer for rain and another one gets a prayer for no rain at the same time . When they speak a du'a ' over a sick person and he gets worse and starts shaking , they will say , " The force of the du'a ' is shaking him ; he is recovering . " Once , when I was in a certain village , a woman came to me , all desperate , and said , " My daughter is dying , please write a prayer for her ! " I refused , but she implored me , and so I wrote one . The next day I received a big basket of fruits as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , had recovered immediately . Is n't this ridiculous ? It was n't because of the du'a ' . It was either the force of God , or nature , or of whatever governs the course of this world , but certainly not that paper . I say that if du'a ' ever had any effect at all , they had it through the word of prophets like Jesus and Muhammad , who spoke with the Creator ? be this now true or not ? but the prayers that are written now by people who live by thievery have no effect because those people themselves are unlawful . I know they are thieves . They have all been attached to the khan and kadkhudas , and from eating the stolen food they got from them their whole bodies have become unlawful . Besides , if you take that tiny piece of paper , write a line on it , and then ask for a hundred toman : Is n't this stealing ? Is n't this cheating ? Is n't this unlawful ? The damband against the wolf seems to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His jaws were slack , he could n't bite . Then the man took a jack-knife and , not thinking that it was the knife upon which the spell had been spoken , opened it to kill the wolf . At this moment the wolf charged and got three animals . But not the gurazband against boars ! One year wild boars were destroying the crops in this little valley over there . A villager got a gurazband // from one of the Sayyids in a nearby village who claim that their dua ' are very effective , and buried it in his field . When he came back the next day , he found that a boar had dug it up and shit on it ! It 's laughable , is n't it ? It 's a lie . People who believe in it are stupid . How does one become a good man ? By fearing God . Someone who wants to better himself must repent the evil he has done , and resolve not to do it again , and say to God , " If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fear of this he wo n't do it again . But only a livelihood enables him to avoid evil . If he has taken pains , and made a life for himself , and if he also keeps in mind that God gave it to him ? God says , " From you the effort , from me the blessings ; ' ? then there is no need to do evil . If I did not have this occupation , with which I earned about thirty toman today , I would be forced to steal to provide a dinner for this child . I was still young when I realized that a man must know a trade . I had read books ? literacy I had picked up myself , I never went to the maktaband I was a believer . I wanted to eat a lawful ( halal ) bit of bread and not to steal ? at that time people here were raiding and plundering up to Isfahan ? and therefore I wanted to learn a trade . So when in 1930 the government was taking the tribal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to learn this craft . With it I can earn a lawful living . If I did not have it , I would be forced to do what these people do : one plows into my land , another one plows into someone else 's land . Was it in Tehran that your ideas changed ? Yes , my beliefs changed there . I saw Reza Shah bringing factories and machines to develop the country , despite the mullahs ' complaints . About a flour mill , for example , they said , " The water from the heavens is Godgiven . What evil have we done that this man , having turned away from the religion , went to Europe , and brought a motor mill which deprives people of their rest at night ? " When I was young they told us that hell was made for the Christians and that paradise was made for us . In Tehran , I understood that this was a lie . If paradise was made at all , it was rather made for the Christians . Their faith is stronger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American College with the Former Landlord 's uncle , who learned English there , and we also went to their church . From what the ministers said and did to us , our beliefs changed . We realized that the true road was n't the one our mullahs had shown us . Of course , the Christians , too , have to believe whatever their priests and ministers tell them , but these do n't tell them lies as ours do . The ministers in the College gave things to us rather than taking things away // from us . They offered us tea , gave us bread , taught us . And are n't you a Christian , giving us your medicines when one of us is sick ? But our Imams and mullahs neither gave us anything , nor will they give us anything . Do you think that the religion will disappear ? No , because everybody , whoever he may be , will at least agree that a creator exists , a creator who causes trees to sprout , rain to fall , and so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will disappear . Only the obsolete is now being dropped . The religion is being purified of the things that were not part of it , that are not found in our books , the things that the mullahs introduced for their own profit . It is purified by those who have travelled to Europe and America and now make us aware . Our own people ruined the religion and our own people are restoring it again . There are many villagers whose beliefs are still the same as those of the Mullah ? although even the Mullah himself ca n't say any longer what he said thirty years ago ; nobody would believe it . These people call me " modernist ; " and " Europe lover ; " that is , one whose views are like those of the Europeans . I only say , " Be that so ! " ? better anyway than be like the mullahs who approve of stealing and an unlawfully earned livelihood . And , by now , there are many who think the same way as I do . 8 The Representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall , impressive man in his late fifties , is a peasant by birth and vocation , and one of the most literate , articulate , and outspoken villagers . With few animals and not much land , his living conditions are rather modest , especially because he also supports a son in the university and another one in high school . Only his wife and the youngest of his seven children still live with him . His fields are taken care of mostly by his sonsin-law and other villagers , leaving him relatively free to pursue his political missions . Above all , the Representative has been the dynamic and highly charismatic spokesman for the villagers for many years . Indeed , his personal history is the history of the political and economic development of the village . As a young man , he became one of the Former Landlord 's retainers over the bitter objections of his parents . His father , a dervish and follower of Shah Ni'matu'llah , already had fought the landlords ' rule himself , supported by his wife . During a traumatic illness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's service and to take up the just cause of the people . Appalled by the coercion , oppression , injustice , and personal misconduct of the chiefs , he started to complain at various government offices all the way to Tehran with such resounding vehemence , that the local landlords and their ally , the paramount chief ( Khan ) , alternately tried to bribe and to frighten him into silence . They had him imprisoned on trumped-up charges , exiled him , denounced him , threatened his life , and had him beaten up ? he lost vision of an eye on one such occasion ? but he did not yield . After the Khan was killed in 1963 and the land reform started , his fight shifted to convincing the land-reform officials that the Landlord 's 91 // claim was unfounded . By that time the Landlord 's power had waned , but he had still enough clout with government officials to bring it about that in 1971 the Representative was sentenced to another prison term and then , on legalistic grounds , removed from his position as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had held since 1966 . Nevertheless , the Representative continued to act as an astute speaker for his people , and dealt with the bureaucracy in such effective ways that the land issue was never settled in the Landlord 's favor . All the while , the Representative strove also to improve economic conditions . He cajoled his fellow villagers into cleaning up and modernizing the village and relentlessly pressed government agencies to provide schools , roads , a clinic , and a bathhouse . With the help of a government loan he built and is now running a gypsum factory in which he employs local men on a quasi profit-sharing basis and produces all the plaster necessary for the booming local building activity . Thus , he became one of the first entrepreneurs of the village . Although from a relatively small peasant family and not wealthy by any standards , he is one of the most influential and most highly regarded men in the village . ( 1971/76 ) . Why have you been fighting oppression ? The religion tells me that the landlords2 have no rights to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is its owner . We have done this here , therefore the land is not their property . When they claim the land , they are robbing the people . It is a violation of the laws of the religion . Therefore the religion says , " Fight it ! Do n't submit to oppression ! " No religion whatsoever permits it that one should be the servant of the other . Or has God perhaps created you to become my servant ? Once , when the Amir al-Mu'minin arrived someplace and one of his men wanted to take his horse to look after it , he did n't permit it . He said , " You look after your own horse , and I look after mine . People must be free and equal . Nobody must be higher than another . " So you do it for religious reasons ? There are two possibilities . Either I am doing it to say , " Look what a great man I am . " If I am doing this , I am committing a sin ? the sin of haughtiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hell . Or else I am doing it because of the religion : if , between myself and God , I do it for the satisfaction of God , and to help the people , then there is nothing better ; it 's better than all worship . // And you are doing it for this latter reason ? I ca n't say . Everybody says about everything he does that he is doing it for God . God Himself knows . It has to be between myself and Him . What is the purpose of this life ? What was God 's aim in creating us ? God created us so that we may reach That Place . Everything is there , not here . As to here , we are told that there is first one world in the father 's loins , then another world in the mother 's womb , and then you come into this world . In this world you remain for a while , but then you have to go ? just as we 'll go home from where we are sitting now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created to make divine , Not to give an eternal soul and then to annihilate . I did not create for my own benefit , But to do some good to my servants . ' And this good , He says , is not here . Here we are tested ? as you are testing your students ? and God tells us to live so as to pass that test . The good is there . This life is hard work , want , grief , tears , fear , and death . But there , there is no death , there is plenty , pleasure , peace , and ease . This world is fleeting . Or is there anything permanent ? How many thousands of people have lived in Shiraz since Sadi and Hafiz ? Where are they now ? Even their graves have vanished . This you have to realize : all this here will come to an end . If these houses were not built of mud but of plaster , not of plaster but of cement , not of cement but of steel ? they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Men are born to die . And when we die , everything here has to remain behind . So what is the meaning of all this ? What are we here for ? Just to eat and shit and go again ? And the universe should have been created just for that ? No , there is something behind all this . All these stars and planets and men and things of the creation ? these are n't just a joke . Or are we here to pile up things , to amass riches ? Even if you had the riches of the whole world , what would they do for you there ? You ca n't take them along . Or are we here that God be worshipped ? If He were a God who needed me and you , what good would He be ? Or are we here to sit in a corner and , muttering a zikr , pass prayer beads through our fingers while people are being oppressed ? No , no , all this is nothing . If it were n't for doing something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what has meaning . If Hazrat-i Isa , the Prophet , the Imam Husayn , had not served the people , what good would they have been ? This is what we have come here for : to work for the good of other people and in the love of God . To serve // the people , which is to serve God , is in essence the meaning of all religious rules . This is what makes a person 's faith right and true . And such deeds are the only riches that remain with him when he dies , the only thing he can take along . For these deeds God will give him a place there . Those who invented the car , made better medicines , built factories , have all been serving the people . If I am doing anything around here , it 's service to the people . But all service to the people has to be done in the love of God and in the knowledge of God . These three are one ; none is right without the others . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know : Who has made all this ? What is God ? What is the soul ? What is man ? For what has he been created ? What is his duty ? Where does he come from ? Where does he go to ? What is true faith ? What are the true riches ? And so on . If one does n't know God , he may even lead a faultless life and it would amount to nothing . Whoever has knowledge ( ma'rifat ) 4 wo n't do any evil . He will do good and God will give him a high place there . Once Hazrat-i Isa asked his disciples , " Do you want riches ? " They said yes , and he left them . He came to the house of an old woman and her son , a poor brushwood collector . The son looked grieved , and when Jesus asked him why , he confessed to be in love with the daughter of the king , but given his position , he stood , of course , no chance of ever marrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ask for her hand . Hesitantly the youth went to the palace , was ? as a joke ? admitted to the king and stated his request . The king laughed at him and said , " Bring me first a tray full of jewels ? ' The young man went back home and told Jesus . Jesus produced a tray of jewels and gave it to him to take to the king . When the king saw the jewels , he became wary , looked at the man , and said , " Bring me three more of these trays . " Again Jesus provided the young man with what was requested . This time the king ordered seven more trays , and the young man brought these , too . At the sight of the seven trays of jewels , the king said , " Who is in your house ? Bring him here ! " Jesus came . The king recognized him , was filled with great joy , and agreed to the marriage . After that he died . Jesus made the young man king . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him where he was going and why he did not make all this for himself . Jesus answered , " There is a greater kingdom where there is no death , and its king is the highest of all . It is he whom I want . " At this the youth said , " Take me along , I want to go there , too . " Jesus said , " Can you ? Then you must leave all this behind . " The youth got up , took off his crown and robes , left the throne , his wife , and his kingdom , and followed Jesus . Jesus returned with him to his disciples and said , // " This is a man who knows the true riches . He has knowledge of the divine ( ma'rifat ) . " Some people have reached very high levels of knowledge . Take Rumi , for instance . What wonder of knowledge is his Mathnavi ! When you read it , and understand it ? I must say I understand only a third of it ? you sense the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ulama ' touched it only with fire tongs , saying it was haram , and sinful to read . That shows you how they were suppressing true knowledge . But no matter what knowledge we attain , we never shall come even close to understanding God , His greatness , His power , His wisdom . It is written that once , when Moses became haughty and thought nobody was like him , God ordered him to go to a certain place . Moses did , and there , on the shore of the sea , he met Hazrat-i Khizr . They started to talk about knowledge ( ilm ) 5 , each giving an account of what he knew . As they talked , an eagle came and scooped up a beakful of water from the sea . Khizr said , " Oh Moses , you should know that your knowledge is like this beakful of water , while mine , in comparison , is like this ocean . But after you others will come , and compared to their knowledge , my own is only like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have got only a beakful of the knowledge of God . And you presume to know everything ? " In a sense , we are like the fishes who once asked their chief in the assembly , " What is water ? " Living in it , they did n't know what it was . In the same way God is everywhere , but we do n't recognize Him . We see certain appearances , but we do n't know what their essence is . Take the story of the devil . He was originally an angel by the name of Azazil . Of all the angels in heaven he was the one nearest to God and had been worshipping God for thousands of years . Then , it is written , the Lord created Adam and ordered all angels to bow before him . All said , " We hear you and obey you ; " and bowed down except this Azazil . Haughtily he said , " I am made of light and this one of earth ; ' and refused to bow . At that , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorway , and ordered Azazil to go in , expecting him to bend his head in the doorway . This He would have accepted as a bow and so forgiven him . But as the angel was about to enter the hall , he saw Adam sitting inside , stopped , and turned back . After that he was damned . The Lord asked him , " Do you want the reward for your worship in this world or the next ? " The devil , wanting to have companions in hell , said , " I want it in this world . I want to have access to all the veins and nerves in the bodies of the offspring of this Adam . Then , on the Last Day , do with me whatever You like . " Now the devil has this access to us , he can seduce us and lead us astray . // Well , what 's now the wisdom ( hikmat ) of this ? We ca n't say . Why has God given the devil this power ? If there were no devil tempting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be less evil in this world , less oppression , violence , adultery , stealing , and so on . So , why ? We do n't know . Does science give us knowledge of God ? Science lets us understand better God 's power . For example , in the past , people said the religion tells a lie when it insists that we say the prayers : wherever God is , He is too far away to hear us . Now we see that the religion was right . Someone may talk in Tehran and at the same time we can hear him here in the radio . If man can do this , how much more can God who created us ! Or when the moon turned black , we used to say a dragon wants to devour her , and we made a lot of noise with cans and bells and by shooting guns to scare it away . Now we know what an eclipse is and have recognized God 's power a little better . After all , science itself comes from the Qur'an . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Qur'an . For some reason that I do not know we here have failed to do this . We only took from the Qur'an the knowledge about the Prophet , the Imams , the prayers , and so on . However , science as such is blind . How much science do the Americans have ? they can even go to the moon ? and yet there is so much unbelief and injustice in their country and they are the oppressors in Vietnam . And besides knowledge , you said , there has to be love ? Yes . Some are acting out of fear , others out of love . Acting out of love is better , much better . Mind you , there are two types of love , untrue love ( ishq-i majazi ) and true love ( ' ishq-i hagigi ) . The former is the love of passion , like being in love with a girl ; the other is love of God , the Prophet , the Amir al-Mu'minin , and so on . Untrue , profane love fades away after a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day by day until it becomes one spark of light . This true love ca n't be given to you . You have to want it , to will it , to find it inside your own self ? that 's the Sufi way . Look at Rumi : he became drunk with love toward God , but so can also quite simple people . Once Moses heard a shepherd crying , " Where are you , oh God , that I may brush the dust off your feet , that I may kiss your feet , comb your hair , give you food ? " Moses said to him , " Do n't say such things ; that 's blasphemy . " But the shepherd , drunk with God , continued , " Where are you , oh God , that I may sweep your room and put your head in my lap ? " At that , Moses chased the shepherd away . Then God said to Moses , " This shepherd has true love . His love is greater than yours . " Moses went after the shepherd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room filled with light and the shepThe // herd , enraptured , thrust back his head and die . And he heard a voice saying , " This evening he will be my guest . " 6 When Hafiz talks about being drunk , he means being drunk with God . In this state of love all the things here lose their importance ; one 's heart is detached from the world . But it is out of this love that comes the will to do good . Never does it mean to submit to oppression . It means to fight it . This is what the Imam Husayn has done ? Exactly . But to understand what he did , you have to know God 's design behind it . The religion tells us that in the Miniature World ( ' alam-i zarr ) , after the creation of Adam , all men who were to come into this world issued from Adam 's side in miniature form , like small ants ? in the same way as from one fly masses of other flies come forth ( now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can indeed do this and so understand Him even better ) . Then God said , " A prophet will come , the Prophet of the Last Times , and the people of this prophet will commit sins . Is there anybody ready to buy up these sins with his suffering ? " All the prophets came forward , but to accept all sins proved to be beyond their strength . Each could take up only a tiny bit and the afflictions he suffered later in his life were in proportion to this . Finally Husayn , the son of Ali , got up and said , " Oh God , I want to buy up all the sins of my grandfather 's people . " God said , " But do you know the stipulations ? Do you agree that you yourself shall be killed , that your sons shall be killed , that your brother shall be killed , that your sister and daughters shall be carried into captivity ? " Husayn agreed . After that , all the miniature creatures returned into the body of Adam . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all creatures came into existence , 124,000 prophets came and went again . Then the Last Prophet came , and Husayn , the son of Ali , was born . When Husayn was seven years old , Gabriel appeared to the Prophet and said , " God sends His peace and says He made an agreement with your Husayn in the Miniature World . Ask him whether he is still ready , and if he is , write it down . " Again , Husayn declared himself ready . The document was written , sealed by the Prophet , Husayn 's grandfather , the Amir al-Mu'minin , his father , and Fatima , his mother , and given to Gabriel , who took it to heaven . The Prophet kissed Husayn 's throat , saying , " They will cut through this neck " We are told that in Karbala , on the morning of Ashura , while the Imam Husayn was saying the prayers , Gabriel descended from heaven and again offered to him to withdraw from the agreement . And again Husayn , the son of Ali , declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do not fully understand ; we say it , we read it , we hear it , but we do not grasp its inner meaning . // In the battle , all of the Imam 's men were martyred . Two of the Imam 's sons were shot dead in their father 's arms . It is written , however , that as long as the Imam himself kept fighting , Yazid 's army could not harm him . It was only when he stopped fighting and sheathed his sword , that they could move in . Then they attacked him till , covered with innumerable wounds , he fell . They all , however , were afraid ? or maybe ashamed ? to cut off his head . They knew he was the grandson of the Prophet . Right then , a Christian happened to come by . Yazid promised him rich rewards here and in the hereafter if he would cut off Husayn 's head . The Christian agreed , but when he stood in front of the Hazrat , . the Hazrat said , " Christian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At that , the Christian remembered that the night before in a dream Hazrat-i Isa had said to him , " Tomorrow , do n't disgrace me in the eyes of the Prophet ! " Then , it is said , the Hazrat lifted the veil from the Christian 's eyes so that he could see all the prophets . Hazrat-i Isa came forward and said to him again , " Do n't disgrace me ! " The Christian became a believer , drew his sword , and fought Yazid 's army till he was martyred . Now his grave is in Karbala and the Shiites make the pilgrimage to him , too . Finally , Shimr went to cut Husayn 's head . But no matter what he did , his sword would not cut through the Imam 's throat . This was because the Prophet had kissed him there . At last , the Imam said , " You have to cut off my head from behind . " Thus , Shimr cut the Imam 's head from behind . After the Imam 's death , his sister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken as prisoners to Damascus . His wife Shahrbanu was ordered to flee to Iran where she escaped her pursuers near Rey by riding into a mountain which closed up behind her . For the sake of this suffering , the Imam Husayn has the privilege to intercede for the people of Muhammad on the Last Day . This Last Day , it is said , will last for 50,000 years . The earth will tremble , the sun will turn into fire , and children will become old from fear . When fear will be beyond bounds , the Prophet will call Hazrat-i Fatima . She will take the Imam Husayn 's blood-stained shirt to the throne of God and say , " Oh God , you have given me and my son a promise . For the sake of his sacrifice , have mercy upon the people of the Last Prophet ! " Then , for the sake of Husayn , the son of Ali , God will forgive them , there will be peace , and the fire of hell will turn into a rose garden . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he agreed to his martyrdom to be able to intercede for the people on the Last Day . But also , if Husayn had not done this , where would be Islam , the pulpits , the mullahs ? This religion would have been extinguished . Husayn established it , he drove it in like a nail . // But , as I said , here again is something which we do not fully understand . Why did Husayn go to Karbala ? Did he know he would be killed there or did n't he ? If he did n't know , then why are we beating our chests for him ? But if he knew , he should not have gone there . Reason does n't allow one to endanger one 's life . Reason tells you that fire burns and , if in spite of this , you hold your hand into the fire , it is not a merit , but a sin . Thus , if Husayn knew he would be killed , reason forbade him to go there . Why did he act against reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew what would happen to him , but he did it out of love toward God . As one gets drunk with wine and then is carried away by his passions , so there is another drunkenness , the drunkenness with God , the love of God . If it had n't been for that love , the love which is higher than reason , Husayn , the son of Ali , would have done wrong in Karbala . But when I say that love is higher than reason , we are getting into another problem . For the Prophet is considered supreme reason and Ali supreme love , and when I say that love is higher than reason , this could be taken to mean that Ali was greater than the Prophet , which , of course , is not true . Some consider it a blasphemy to say that . But I say , the two together are one . Sure , Muhammad was supreme reason and Ali was supreme love , but that reason was also love and that love was also reason . Only those on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jesus was greater or Muhammad . Those with greater knowledge know that both are of one light . It is only you and I , or rather , the priests and the mullahs , who corrupt this truth and fight over it . Tomorrow , on the Last Day , both of us ? I who said Muhammad is greater , and you who said Jesus is greater ? will be told , " You both lied ; you did n't understand ? ' Thus , Husayn sacrificed himself for us for the love of God . But , mind you , whatever we say about his deed , we are only speaking about its outer form ; we do n't know its mystery . You said if Husayn had n't done this , the religion would not exist . Why should there be a religion ? If there were no religion , everybody would run after every woman and everybody would steal and rob . There would be sheer chaos . Life would be impossible . If the prophets and Imams had not come and told us God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be nothing . We would know nothing . How would we know God ? We would be savages . This does n't mean , however , that everybody abides by the religious rules perfectly . In fact , only very few people are doing so .
