txt Senator Percy rushed off to Moscow in advance of his own accession as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to tell the bosses of the Kremlin he favors the establishment of a Palestinian state with Yasser Arafat , the terrorist , as head of it . This kind of makes you wonder what Mr. Percy said on other subjects : Did he urge the Soviet Union to crack down on Poland ? Or beef up ifs brigades in Cuba ? Or light a fire under the Sandinistas ? Probably not . The best way to make sure would be for the State Department to release the rest of the cables it 's holding on the Percy junket . But the Senator would probably object to that , since he 's already complained that leaks of his comments on the Palestinian situation is " of grave concern to me and other Senators . . . . " It Pays to Advertise You let the lawyers advertise and what happens ? They start encouraging people to file for bankruptcy . Partly as a result of this , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bankruptcy business is booming and creditors are complaining , the Associated Press reports . TheAP says it 's hard to compare recent statistical trends , because one change in the bankruptcy law allows a hus- , band and wife to file a joint petition instead of two separate ones . But some estimates figure 60% more people are represented by bankruptcy petitions in 1980 than in 1979 . Where 'd all the money go ? Clearly a good bit of it is going to lawyers fees . Revolutionary Troubles Shades of the 19605 in the U.S.A. Here the Nicaraguan revolution is rumbling along quite nicely under the : aegis of Fidel Castro when suddenly we read that the Sandinistas are be ' ginning to founder on that age-old rock in the path of social progress , the women 's movement . The revolution decreed sexual equality , of course , but one woman working for the new regime reported that her husband " could n't stand it . He made me choose between him and the women 's association . When I chose the organization , he walked out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " no to machismo , but in practice things are more difficult . " One woman , however , found an answer for her husband : " I persuaded him to get Involved in the revolution . Now he 's the best organizer in the barrio and there are no more problems at home . " It takes more than a revolution to keep old-fashioned manipulation down . Learning the Ropes Academic jobs are not all that easy to come by in anthropology today . So at the just-completed annual meeting of the American Anthropological Association , the Members were wondering how they could get more anthropologists hired by the federal government . They can be immensely useful to the bureaucracy , some of them said , in mediating between the culture of the public official and the culture of the citizen. : . " We are not afraid of differentes , " one of them described the profession 's strength . But they now realize that they have lost out on Jabs so far because they have failed to ' put ' their knowledge to work in doping out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run like a big family , " an anthropologist at the meeting finally enlightened his colleages . " The ins have power and the outs are trying to take it ; away . Anthropologists always made the mistake of identifying with the outs ; therefore , they could never break in . " Really makes you want to hire an anthropologist for your government program , does n't it ?
