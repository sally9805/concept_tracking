Throughout Malacanang Palace there was a festive air . In the hall below the President 's office , a large Christmas tree stood festooned with white ribbons and ornaments . The weeks of coup rumors were over now , and the presidential staff was visibly relaxed . The 60-day cease-fire with the Communist insurgents was under way , despite some violations , bringing the promise of the first peaceful Christmas in the Philippines in 17 years . Dressed in a navy blue dress with red piping , President Aquino was in a holiday mood as she greeted Hong Kong Bureau Chief William Stewart and Manila Reporter Nelly Sindayen . At the end of the hour-long conversation , however , there was a moment of great poignancy . As she spoke about her memories of her husband and her obligations to her country , the President 's eyes filled with tears . It was , by all accounts , the first time she has cried in public since becoming Chief Executive . Excerpts from the talk : <P> Q. How do you feel after ten months as President ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ten months of experience is definitely very helpful . It 's helped my self-confidence . It 's still not an enjoyable task . I do n't think it ever will be , but certainly it is most fulfilling . I think that 's the rewarding aspect of the job . <P> Q. Why do you think that you have become such a worldwide phenomenon ? <P> A. Well , I do n't know . Maybe it 's because , first of all , I 'm a woman , a widow , and maybe also because I have had some unique experiences . Before , I thought my life was nothing unusual . But I guess that starting with my husband 's incarceration , I did experience some unusual situations and events . Also , my husband 's assassination received such worldwide attention . If my husband had not been Ninoy Aquino , people would not have bothered with me . <P> Q. What have been your most important achievements so far ? <P> A. Well , first and foremost is the fact that people believe in their government , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . My husband used to say that the sad part of the imposition of martial law was that the Filipino people no longer believed in traditional institutions . How can you do anything if the people do not believe in each other or their officials ? I do n't want to say that this is my achievement . It is the Filipino people together who were able to believe in themselves because of what they were able to do in the election and then in the revolution . Because of this belief in each other , they were now also able to look up to their leaders and follow their leaders . While we have not achieved total unity , I am confident we are working toward that end with the coming plebiscite on the constitution . <P> Q. Six years from now , if it is clear you are still needed and the people want you , will you run again ? <P> A. ( laughing ) I think I was needed just for the transition , when people had to find somebody they could believe in , someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the people 's perception , I fit that particular role . But I am sure that six years from now , there will be many qualified people , and I will have earned a well-deserved rest . <P> Q. As you look back at your life , what people or events influenced you most ?
