One of the few men to have seen such things is Robert Duane Ballard , a geologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution , internationally known for his deep-sea explorations . He is credited with having observed more of the creatures , mountains and minerals of the ocean bottom and spent more time on the sea floor or close to it than anyone else in the world . As the guiding light for expeditions in deep-diving research submarines , Dr. Ballard has participated in more than 100 dives to the ocean floor. // But what would provoke a man to squeeze his 6-foot-2-inch frame into the cramped , clammy quarters of a tiny submarine and set off on hazardous expeditions several miles beneath the surface of the ocean ? // " I ' m a romanticist , " Dr. Ballard says , fixing an office visitor with a stare to be sure what he is saying will be understood . " It ' s the excitement of diving several miles deep , seeing something no one had ever seen before . When I was a kid , Osa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1930 ' s , and to me the oceans were another form of exploration. // " And when I was in grade school in southern California , I got a taste of the ocean and loved it , " Dr. Ballard continued . " So when I was in high school in San Diego , fishing and bodysurfing , I wrote a letter to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography that said simply : ' I love the ocean - what can I do ? ' " That letter resulted in an invitation for him to enroll in a summer program at Scripps. // The sea kept him in its thrall as he climbed the educational ladder on the rungs of marine chemistry , porpoise training , oceanography , geophysics , deep submersible engineering and a doctorate in geology . Eventually arriving at Woods Hole in 1970 , the young marine researcher became acquainted with Alvin , the deep-sea research submarine. // " My interest in geology and submarines came together at Woods Hole , " he said . The opportunity to use Alvin gave him a chance to investigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tectonics , the study of the motion of the earth ' s crustal plates and the forces that move them. // Although at the time oceanographers saw little value in the use of submarines for undersea research , Dr. Ballard succeeded in leading Project Famous , the French-American Mid-Ocean Undersea Study , a series of dives that explored parts of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge . His engineering experience enabled him to design Angus , an acoustically navigated survey sled with a camera attached , whose pictures pinpointed areas that observers in Alvin could later explore. // Using this procedure , Dr. Ballard and his co-workers made the most exciting oceanographic discovery of recent years - the existence of tiny colonies of previously unknown life forms that lived in the blackness of the ocean floor by obtaining nutrients from hot plumes of mineral-rich water spouting like smoke from volcanic rifts in the earth ' s crust. // The discovery showed scientists an ecosystem whose energy seems to be ultimately derived not from photosynthesis in green plants but from the heat and chemicals that spew from the earth ' s interior . It yielded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth ' s crust and the chemistry of the oceans . Some scientists , for example , now think that over a period of millions of years all of the oceans ' 328 million cubic miles of water may percolate down through cracks into the earth ' s interior , then be heated and recirculated back into the oceans , laden with chemicals and minerals. // But Dr. Ballard was more excited by the discovery itself than its possible scientific significance . " It was an incredible emotional roller-coaster ride , " he said . " And it made me realize that my honest motivation is as much the excitement of exploration as the science of it. " // In the world of research specialists , the extroverted 40-year-old Kansas-born marine geologist is not the archetype of the professional laboratory scientist . Part engineer , part explorer , part oceanographer , part geologist and part administrator , he is also a public speaker , author and articulate popularizer of science on television and in the National Geographic , activities that sometimes cause his peers to regard him with suspicion. // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of amorphous organism , " he said . " So you never get a consensus on ideas , especially in the earth sciences , and you have to have multiple hypotheses . So when you talk to the public you can get into trouble because other scientists may not agree with you. " // " I know that some scientists think of Carl Sagan and Jacques Cousteau as publicity hounds because of their TV shows and all that , " Dr. Ballard said . " Those two have probably sometimes lost some of the regard of their fellow scientists . But look at the good they ' ve done by making science exciting and making people aware of it ! And don ' t forget that my science is paid for by some poor coal miner whose taxes go to support me while I ' m having fun , so I feel it ' s responsible to go to him and the public and tell them what I ' m doing. " // Seeing new panoramas in the undersea darkness can be almost a transcendental experience , Dr. Ballard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alvin ' s searchlight through a six-inch-thick plastic window. // " In traveling over new ground the most exciting transition is going from a flat ocean desert to the high mountains , " he related . " It ' s like climbing a mountain at night on your hands and knees with a flashlight . Then , suddenly , you come to an abyss , and in a submarine it ' s a unique sensation to drive over a deep fissure . This one was 28 feet wide and it was the first time I or any other human had ever seen one . It was an awesome sight and I just wanted to hang around there instead of going on . It was a time when your sense of discovery overcomes your sense of science . We were all as excited as little boys ! " he said. // Now Dr. Ballard has set his sights on the mapping of the Mid-Ocean Ridge , the 40 , 000-mile submerged mountain range that girdles the globe like the seam on a baseball , bigger than the Himalayas , Rockies and Andes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that covered nearly all of one long wall of his office at Woods Hole . " We ' ve spent about four months a year for the last decade examining it but we ' ve still seen only one-tenth of one percent of it , " he told his visitor. // To " see " and map the rest of it , a project that will take decades , Dr. Ballard has devised a system that he likens to the way Star Trek ' s Commander Kirk views outer space around him in the command room of the spaceship Enterprise. // The system involves an unmanned submersible system with dual vehicles , called Argo and Jason , that will be towed by the 240-foot-long support ship Atlantis II . The names of the two still-to-be-built submersibles are taken from the Greek myth in which Jason sails the ship Argo in search of the Golden Fleece. // Argo ' s array of television and sonar equipment will give scientists on the support ship a wide view of the sea floor , Dr. Ballard said . When it detects an interesting area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deployed to obtain more information . Both Argo and Jason , with new ultrasensitive cameras , will transmit high-quality pictures to the surface ship , which will be able to relay the images via satellite to any point in the world. // Dr. Ballard said that much of the the $30 million the project will cost is being provided by the United States Navy and other Federal sources . All three vehicles are expected to be ready in 1985. // " We hope to get even clearer pictures of the sea floor and what goes on down there , " Dr. Ballard said . " And maybe the pictures will help man to better understand how life began on earth. " //
