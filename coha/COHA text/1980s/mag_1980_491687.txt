the mocking could she run away when around her was nothing but water-250,000 square miles of it , known in the world 's atlases as the South China Sea . Most of all , Tran wanted to cover her nakedness . But this was no more possible than was escape . The pirates had taken her clothes when they forced the 17 prettiest women and girls on the refugee boat to strip . Tran 's slim body began to shake even though the tropical sun burned her flesh . Help would come . Somehow  --  some way  --  she must be spared what her mind revolted at contemplating . She prayed , but no deliverer came . Some of the women resisted . Those who did were beaten and threatened . The sharp point of a knife held against the throat of a defenseless woman can be an effective peacemaker . One young man whose fianc  --  e was among the 17 selected by the pirates struggled to save his beloved . He was left on the deck , unconscious and bleeding . There was no more resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little boat , broken only by the squeals of the attackers , the soft sobs of the women and the lap of the waves against the hull . As the pirates began their brutal attacks , the rest of the refugees turned away . They would spare Tran and the other tragic victims the ultimate indignity of anaudience to witness their shame . " This is not the way it was supposed to end , " Tran remembers thinking . Before leaving Vietnam they talked about the reports they had heard of attacks on other refugee boats . What is the powerful motivation that could still send a woman like Tran  --  and tens of thousands of others like her  --  on a perilous voyage to the edge of hell ? To understand it , you must go back to 1975 . When the communists stood at the gates of Saigon that year , panic swept through the population . Hundreds of thousands who had fought the Viet Cong , served the govern  --  ment of Nguyen Van Thieu , worked with the Americans or simply hated communism , sought ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airport was a flurry of frantic activity as for  --  eigners and Vietnamese alike fought for priority space on flights that were leaving around the clock . What was supposed to have been an orderly departure , with pri  --  orities predetermined , turned into a rout . Of the more than one-half million Vietnamese who qualified for evacuation , only 135,000 got out in the first wave . Families were split . Sometimes it was agreed that one would go and the others would come later if they could escape . Decisions affecting a lifetime had to be made in split seconds . I know of one case in which a Vietnamese staff member of an American private organization had to leave behind his two youngest children with relatives because families were limited to six members on U.S. government evacuation flights . When the last helicopter lifted senior government personnel from the roof of the American embassy , peo  --  ple were left grasping for the rope ladder which swung beneath the carriage . An era was ended . And the door to the country slammed shut . The communists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had unified through violence and treachery and over which they now held uncontest  --  ed control . When the new masters came marching from the jungle and riding in their tanks into Saigon , there was no victory celebration . A quiet fear gripped the city . Ng Ngoc Thong was sure something terrible would be done to the people who had , with the help of the Americans and other allies , withstood the Viet Cong for so long . Thong was a 34-year-old bachelor lawyer , but during his country 's struggles he had given up law for soldiering . Now with all the other residents of Saigon , he waited for the hammer and sickle to fall . " But we were surprised , " he recalled at a refugee camp in Indonesia . " For the first month things went smoothly and we thought these kinsmen from the North might not be as bad as we had been led to believe . At first things did n't seem that much different from the old days except that the soldiers walking around town wore different uniforms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the guns had stopped . " Welcome as that was , some nervousness prevailed after 15 days , when the first subtle signs began to ap  --  pear indicating that things might not remain the same . The new regime announced that all enlisted personnel of ARVN ( Army of the Republic of Vietnam , the de  --  feated soldiers of President Thieu ) would be required to attend a three-day reeducation camp . Thong dutifully signed up to go even though he ex  --  pected the men would not be allowed to return home . Again he was wrong . The three-day course consisted of lectures on social  --  ism and the sayings of Ho Chi Minh , the revered founder and long-time leader of the Vietnamese com  --  munist movement . There was no mistreatment of the ex-ARVN soldiers . Not even any threats . Thong began to relax when he got back home ? which , he now says , was exactly what the North Vietnamese wanted him to do . " It was all a ruse , " he says , " part of their strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because a few weeks later , when the new masters called all former officers and high government officials to a ten-day reeducation camp , everyone went willingly , thinking they would come home after their political indoctrina  --  tion . " This time they were wrong . At the end of ten days none came home . Most did n't return for months , and their families had no word from them . Some , according to Thong , have never come back and it is assumed they are either dead or viewed by the communists as " polit  --  ically incorrigible . " Thong is sure the whole exercise was meant to determine who was capable of experi  --  encing a political conversion and who would likely always be politically unreliable . The former went home after appropriate reeducation ; the latter disappeared . So , having successfully moved against all former military personnel , the communists turned their atten  --  tion to what they considered their next most serious threat to reshaping the society  --  the " rich capitalists . " The term was very loosely applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were un  --  doubtedly some unscrupulous profiteers among them , but most of those targeted were nothing more than reasonably prosperous businessmen who had managed to acquire some wealth and property through honest business transactions . Such a man was Phan Van Tinh . He and his family were Christians , having been brought up in the Tinh Lanh ( Evangelical ) Church . His father had taken him into the family jewelry business when he was 23 . Like most Vietnamese young men , however , he did his turn in the army , four years , be  --  tween 1962 and 1966 . After his military service , he returned to the family business in Bien-hoa and lived quietly . He married a Christian girl , Sarah , and they were blessed with six beautiful children . The business prospered and Tinh bought some houses as investment property . Then he bought a drugstore and a piece of farm land . He ex  --  pected he would have enough to get his children started in life and then see himself and his wife through their old age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days after the fall of Saigon , the communists struck the first blow at the despised " capitalists . " It was announced that as of that moment , all precious stones , all precious metals and all foreign currency were the property of the new government . Nothing in those categories could be bought , sold or traded . For a man in the jewelry business , that was quite a blow . So the communist officials came to Tinh 's shop and put him out of business . Oh , it was all done legally enough . The entire stock of jewelry was inventoried , Continued on page 127 He Arose continued from page 121 And since Christ arose , we have a High Priest at the right hand of God who ever lives to intercede for God 's children . We are not left alone in a Godless , Christless world , for we have a living Savior . He ever lives to make intercession for us according to the will of God . Jesus did n't stay dead ! Not only at Easter but every day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liv  --  ing Savior . A Books continued from page 101 by Bob Hope ( who opined that Don Freeman was safe in asking him to write the preface because , if he refused , Freeman would refer to him in a later column as " the plump , balding , sel  --  dom-funny comedian " ) , Freeman talks with personalities from Barbara Wal  --  ters to Helen Gurley Brown , Gary Cooper to Johnny Carson , and makes no excuse for liking programs from " M*A*S*H " to " Masterpiece The  --  atre . " In fact , he makes no excuses for anything or anyone , not even the " in  --  tellectuals " who snub television and therefore have never taken their places in a medium that by its own admission could use more brainpower . The book is filled with anecdotes , making it a trivia collector 's treasure . Somehow Freeman manages to cover subjects as diverse as travel , women , cats and dogs and politics , and link them all to the television experience . " Television is all of us , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fears and dreams , the best and worst in the human character , with all the shad  --  ings in between . " Makes TV sound something like a candidate for the Lit  --  erary Guild , does n't he ? A Asian Exodus continued from page 77 and when it was taken away to the bank for " safekeeping , " he was given a receipt for every item ! At his home in California , Tinh looks at the long list and smiles wryly . Although he was out of the jewelry business by government expropri  --  ation , Tinh still had his drugstore  --  but only for seven more months . In January 1976 , the government decided it wanted a monopoly on medicines , so Tinh had to close his pharmacy as well . Tinh knows of a number of busi  --  nessmen who resisted these measures and were shot . And still they were not through with the " capitalists . " In the same manner that the commu  --  nists had announced new regulations regarding businesses , houses came in for some strange edicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meters ( about 1,850 square feet ) would be confiscated by the government . In addition , size of houses should be de  --  termined by the number of people liv  --  ing in them , not by the ability of the owner to pay for or maintain it . Con  --  sequently , each person was allowed on  --  ly 78 square feet of living space . Tinh lost on both counts . His home at Bien-hoa had over 3,000 square feet , so it was immediately confiscated . Score one more for the communists . Next he got notice that his house in Saigon was also due for confiscation . ( It was 59 square feet over the " legal " limit . ) However , Tinh managed to keep it until his escape because of the number of people living in it . Because none of the family members had government-approved work posi  --  tions , they were unable to get rice ra  --  tion cards . ( Jobs , incidentally , were not handed out on the basis of talent , skill or training , but rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bers . ) Even a ration card , however , would not have guaranteed rice to Tinh 's family . It would have meant only that when rice was available , they could get it at the official rate . For the favored ones who possessed the trea  --  sured card , it was not an inconsequen  --  tial benefit , since rice on the black mar  --  ket cost up to ten times over the offi  --  cial rate . But it was from the black market ( also called the " running market " because the vendors would set up their stalls on different streets at random times and literally run away when the communist cadres learned of it ) that Tinh had to support his family from 1976 to 1978 . They managed , although somewhat precariously , because he had managed to keep back some of the gold and precious stones from his jewelry store before the communists " liberated " the stock from its capitalist owner . The poor people who had neither ra tion cards nor resources went hungry . Thong remembers that while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were very shrewd in things that mattered . For example , even the officers of the North Vietnamese army who took over all government posts in the South did n't Continued on following page know how to use a flush toilet . He says they would put towels in the toilet for washing and then blame the Ameri  --  cans for " swallowing " their towels when they were flushed away . They also tried to clean their fish in the toilets with the same disastrous results . When they finally found out what the toilets were for , they still squatted down beside the fixture and then dumped the deposit in the water , triumphantly flushing it away ! However , Thong says , it would be a mistake to write these people off as loutish . He scores them high marks as fighters ( " They follow orders to the let  --  ter and can be relied on to advance toward an objective without second thoughts " ) and as con trollers of people . The communists altered family relationships , the ex-lawyer reports . Children were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " where they were encouraged to report their parents if the adults were not following the party line . Traditional family customs changed drastical  --  ly . Because the father might no longer be the chief breadwinner , his authority in the family structure was undermined . Gradually , the grip was tightening . The pressures rapidly intensified . People had to get permits from the local officials in the town where they lived before they could stay elsewhere over  --  night . The permits had to be renewed each month . Tinh tells of the two Montagnard pastors who came to Saigon in 1978 from their home in Da Lat , a city in the highlands . They had the appropriate documents for travel , and as night ap  --  proached , their host , who was a local pastor , went to the local government office to register them . A low-ranking officer gave them permission to sleep in the church but did not bother to tell them that the request had to be ap  --  proved at a higher level . It would n't have mattered anyhow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office was closed . Security police came during the night and arrested the pastor of the church , the assistant pastor , the presi  --  dent of the congregation and the two visiting tribesmen . The senior pastor , who was over 70 years old , was re  --  leased a few days later , but the ex  --  perience caused him to have a heart at  --  tack . The other four were sent to a concen  --  tration camp in central Vietnam . Tinh 's informants tell him they are still there . Tinh makes a point to differen  --  tiate between reeducation camps and concentration camps : " A reeducation camp is where you are brainwashed with communist ideology and where you are made to work hard . You are told that the reason for this is because you made others work before , so now you must be made to understand what hard work really is . Even the work is supposed to be part of the reeducation process . " A concentration camp , " he says , " is like a prison . You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  lowed to work . You are sent there as a punishment for some crime . " So four religious leaders are in a con  --  centration camp for the " crime " of sleeping in a church without the necessary permission ! Under the communists , all religions came in for difficulties . Lawyer Thong says that while the new regime did not forbid worship , they put Ho Chi Minh 's picture above all the others in the churches and strictly regulated congregational meetings . Tinh says , " The communists hate all religion , but especially Christianity , because  --  they say  --  it opened a way for foreigners to enter the country . " As is true in most communist coun  --  tries , the practice of religion is not totally prohibited . The regime just makes it exceedingly difficult , if not impossible , for the church to function normally . For example , the church in Vietnam has lost virtually all its young people . They are not forbidden to at  --  tend the services  --  the government just makes sure that other activities are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these activities are in the form of work projects . Sunday is street-cleaning day or rice-planting day or land-cultivation day , and the young people are formed into work brigades . Sometimes they are sent outside the town for a whole weekend , especially if they have jobs with the government  --  and there are n't many other jobs available in Vietnam today . In fact , Tinh says bitter  --  ly that there are no more weekends in Vietnam . " Sunday is just another day , " he observes . His own children were assigned on Sundays to trim the trees in their town of Bien-hoa . Preoccupation with the border war with China in 1979 led to a relaxation of some restrictions , and the churches were once again crowded , indicating that faith among Christians still runs deep . A recent letter received by a refugee from a relative in Vietnam said : " A lot of people go to church now and their faith is getting stronger because it is too sad outside . Life is so desperate that we have to go to church to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no census of the numbers of refugees who have left Vietnam since 1975 . All that the rest of the world knows is how many of the " boat peo  --  ple " have managed to make it to land ; this number , as of October 1 , 1979 , was nearly 400,000 . However , it is gener  --  ally agreed by many authorities that those who made it represent perhaps only half of those who tried . Every generation needs to be re  --  minded of its own holocaust , and this one is still in the making . There are thousands of stories from the survi  --  vors . But we do not know the terrible experiences of those who did n't make it  --  for , as in murder mysteries , dead men tell no tales . X
