Golf generally works as an allegory for life , with all its trials of whimsy and honor , although too much can be made of golf 's solitary responsibilities and life 's essential loneliness . Done well , neither living nor golfing is negotiated completely alone , as a master at both demonstrated last week on a particularly sunny day in Augusta , Ga . <P> For a bear , Jack Nicklaus is surprisingly short , maybe 5 ft. 10 in . From a low of 170 lbs . last summer , too light to make the cut in either the U.S. or British Open , he has reaccumulated a paunch appropriate to a 46-year-old , while remaining considerably trimmer than the burr-headed and bulging Ohio youth who won three Masters during four mid- ' 60s years . Handsomely , Nicklaus won two others , along with just about everything else , in the ' 70s . <P> Until last week , Helen Nicklaus , 78 , had not revisited Augusta National since her son 's first Masters as a Walker Cup amateur in 1959 . That year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Ohio State to fetch Jack 's girlfriend Barbara . Among many privileges the pharmacist accorded his son was access to a storied golf course , the local Scioto Country Club , where Bobby Jones won a U.S. Open in 1926 . Jack developed his sense of history there , and his mother must have some sense of it too , because this year she suddenly decided to return to the Masters . <P> Charlie Nicklaus has been dead for 16 years , but Charlie 's stamp on Jack is visible yet . If Scioto Pro Jack Grout taught Nicklaus how to play , and Nicklaus taught himself how to win , Charlie taught Jack how to lose . Since his unexpected fourth U.S. Open and fifth P.G.A . victories at the age of 40 , Nicklaus has spent six mostly twilit years displaying an unerring grace ( everywhere but on the greens ) that brought him to the last round of his 28th Masters four strokes and eight players behind . <P> Caddying for him was his oldest son Jackie , 24 , himself a golfer of promise , winner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack have a daughter and four sons . Increasingly , the children egg their father into joining them at golf , feigning selfish interests but not fooling him . " They want the old man to practice , " he says . Corporate setbacks have recently conspired with creaking muscles to limit his time on the courses he builds . It would be an exaggeration to say Jackie had to lead the old man around the National like a blind ward , but just a slight one . Color-blind to begin with ( Hart Schaffner and Barbara have dressed him for years ) , Nicklaus has lost the horizon . He mourns , " I 'm missing the pleasure of watching my golf ball finish  --  I ca n't see that far anymore . " Throughout the tournament , he was forever asking Jackie , " Did it stay on the green ? " Sunday , they conferred over putts like sailors gauging breakers . " Looks like the left edge , " Jackie would say . His father would laugh . " How about an inch out on the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for a three at the par-four ninth . Nicklaus faced a 25-footer for another birdie at ten . " Oddly enough I felt comfortable over it and made it . " At eleven , a 20-footer rolled in " as pretty as can be . " Rather than stall him , a bogey at twelve actually gave him steam . He birdied 13 , eagled 15 ( a three at the par five ) and nearly made a hole in one at 16 . The noise rippling across the course was unmistakable .
