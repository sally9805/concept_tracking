Meanwhile , some political figures and leaders of Jewish organizations suggested that the incident had brought into the open the question of whether Mr. Jackson has benefited from a " double standard " under which his opponents have been reluctant to criticize him because he is the only black among the major candidates . And there were signs that the bad feeling between the candidate and Jewish leaders was not ended by his statements Sunday night. // Walter F. Mondale , calling the " Hymie " characterization " derisive , " said today that " it should not have been used . " Ernest F. Hollings said he did not think the civil rights leader was anti-Semitic but that he made a mistake in his choice of words . George McGovern refused to criticize Mr. Jackson at all , saying he did not want " to be passing judgment on the other candidates. " // Nathan Perlmutter , director of the Anti-Defamation League of B ' nai B ' rith , and State Senator Julian Bond of Atlanta , a black politician supporting Mr. Mondale , were among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his white opponents and by journalists who were wary that vigorous criticism of Mr. Jackson might make them appear to be racist . <> <> Some Assailed More Strongly // // Mr. Perlmutter said that remarks suggesting prejudice by conservative white political figures , like former Interior Secretary James G. Watt and former Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz , had drawn much stronger condemnations than those heard today in the wake of Mr. Jackson ' s acknowledgement that he had used language many regard as offensive. // " Hymie " is a shortened form of Hyman , a name once relatively common among Jews ; using the nickname to refer to Jews in general might be likened to referring to an Irish person as " Mick. " // Mr. Jackson acknowledged his use of the characterization , which was overheard by a reporter , in an appearance Sunday night before an audience of 400 at a Manchester synagogue. // The admission marked a reversal for Mr. Jackson , who for two weeks had insisted that he had " no recollection " of ever using such language . Politically , the speech also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had changed Mr. Jackson ' s campaign for the nation ' s first primary Tuesday from an exuberant crusade into an exercise in damage control. // " Even as I affirm to you that that term was used in private conversation , " Mr. Jackson told the audience , " I categorically deny that I am anti-Semitic . " <> <> No ' Spirit of Meanness ' // // " At first I was shocked by the press interest in private conversations apparently overheard by a reporter , " he said . Mr. Jackson ' s remarks were reported several days ago by Milton Coleman , a writer for The Washington Post . In Washington today , The Post said Mr. Coleman would have no further comment on the article. // Mr. Jackson , a Baptist clergyman , said the language was not used " in the spirit of meanness. " // " However innocent and unintended , " he added , " it was wrong. " // Mr. Jackson alluded to the strains that arose between him and Jewish leaders following a visit to the Middle East five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yasir Arafat , the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization . Since then , he said , " there has been so much pain , anxiety and hositility , I have not felt welcome " among Jews. // Noting the alliance between blacks and Jews during the civil rights struggle of the 1960 ' s , Mr. Jackson said he now " offered my campaign as a vehicle of reconciliation " for all minorities , including Jews. // " I affirm to you that the term was used in a private conversation " in which " we sometimes let our guard down , " Mr. Jackson said . He added , " An off-color remark has no bearing on religion or politics. " // Mr. Jackson said today that his delay in acknowledging the remark was based on two considerations . " On the one hand , I had a desire to keep open the doors that were open ; on the other hand , I did not want to lie and be absolute , " he said , indicating that his previous statements that he did not remember using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , were very firm . " It simply is not true , and I think that the accuser ought to come forth , " Mr. Jackson said Feb. 19 on the CBS News program " Face the Nation. " // Today , most of Mr. Jackson ' s rivals chose to praise him for apologizing instead of questioning the way he dealt with the issue . " It was appropriate for him to apologize , " Gary Hart said . " I ' m sure Reverend Jackson has no derogatory feelings in his soul at all. " // Hart aides said Mr. Hart had avoided criticizing Mr. Jackson earlier because it was unclear if he had actually made the remarks and also because the Colorado Senator did not want to antagonize black voters . <> <> Loose Use of Language // // Senator Hollings of South Carolina , the state where Mr. Jackson was born , struck a note of conciliation . " I ' ve heard myself and white politicians use language loosely , " he said at a news conference . " I ' ve heard journalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reporters in Portsmouth , praised Mr. Jackson ' s courage for admitting " his mistake . " " The people there accepted that last night , " the Ohio Senator said . " I think it will be dropped or should be. " // Alan Cranston called the affair " unfortunate , " saying , " We don ' t need issues like this " creating division between blacks and Jews. // Mr. McGovern , whose criticisms of Israel have sometimes stirred political opposition for him among American Jews , said his refusal to criticize Mr. Jackson was based on the fact that he had " argued for less criticism " among candidates. // He said that until last night it was unclear what Mr. Jackson had said . " But since at the first opportunity he apologized to the Jewish community for what he said , I ' m not going to say any more about it . " <> <> Apology Called ' Belated ' // // Hyman Bookbinder , Washington representative of the American Jewish Committee , said today that a " double standard " had consistently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press , and by Jews themselves . He said this arose from an understandable desire that criticisms of Mr. Jackson not be misinterpreted as attacks on blacks in general. // Mr. Perlmutter said Mr. Jackson ' s apology " albeit belated , is nonetheless welcome . " But he chided the other candidates for the soft tone of their responses , which he called " walking on eggshells. " // " I would guess that if Butts or Watt or some other person in high office had made some of the statements Jesse Jackson has made , my guess is that there would have been quicker and more resonant reaction , " he said. // He said there was wide awareness among Jews that the Democrats " have not clearly and categoricaly separated themselves from statements attributed to Jesse Jackson. " // Howard I. Friedman , president of the American Jewish Committtee , said he welcomed " Mr. Jackson ' s call for renewing the dialogue among blacks and Jews . " But he said it was time for Mr. Jackson to " re-examine other statements he has made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holocaust , about so-called Jewish power , about Arafat and the P.L.O. " // This touched on the apparently strong bad feeling that lingered on both sides today . In an interview , Mr. Jackson complained about a 19-page critique of his record on Jewish issues compiled by the Anti-Defamation League . He said such work by major Jewish organizations encouraged more militant groups. // " When the established people are silent or circulate information against me like the A.D.L. , they lay the predicate for elements who are considered irresponsible to act , " he said. // He also said he would not comply with Mr. Perlmutter ' s request that he repudiate the endorsement of Louis Farrakhan , leader of a faction of the Black Muslims. // Mr. Farrahkhan , in an appearance Saturday with Mr. Jackson , warned Jewish organizations that there would be retaliation " if you harm this brother. " // Mr. Jackson today defended the remarks , saying it reflected black anger at the assassination of leadership figures . " Jews went to the chambers silently , " Mr. Jackson said .
