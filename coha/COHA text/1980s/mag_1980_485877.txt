WHO shall inherit the power ? That is the central question today in Pittsburgh and Youngstown and Gary . This nation-wide steel strike is no mere squabble over wages and hours and collective bargaining and the open shop . These are the shibboleths , the battle-cries ; but the real question is , Who shall control our steel industry , our mines of coal and iron , our roaring furnaces , our giant rolling mills that swallow down white-hot ingots only to belch them forth again as finished rails and beams and girders ? Who shall direct the busy life in mine and mill , in stokehole and locomotive cab , in company town and industrial city ? That is the question , and because of it we have civil war in Buffalo and Cleveland and McKeesport and Clairton and Farrell . It is this question that Mr. Morgan really has in mind when he cables Judge Gary : " Heartiest congratulations on your stand for the open shop , with which I am , as you know , absolutely in accord . I believe American principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm . " It is this question that Mr. William Z. Foster , secretary of the strike committee , faced when he wrote , some years since , in - his pamphlet on syndicalism : " The Syndicalism movement is a labor union movement which , in addition to fighting the everyday battles of the working class , intends to overthrow capitalism and reorganize society in such a manner that exploitation of man by man through the wages system shall cease . " It is of this question that The Sun ( New York ) is thinking when it makes extended quotations from Mr. Foster 's " damnable doctrines and precepts , " only to wind up : " And it is to this exotic beast of prey that Judge Gary refuses to extend the olive branch ! " Here is a real issue , and in face of it there is no use in scolding the steel workers or lecturing Judge Gary . It would be far better for us all to think soberly and quietly and humbly . Who shall inherit the power ? The power in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mines , the railroads , the mills , the factories ; these have been able to direct our industries , and in great part to control our political life . The labor movement opposed to them , until the war came , only a feeble , withal a growing resistance . That movement has had two branches . One , led by Mr. Gompers , has accepted the existing arrangement in its fundamentals , trying to exact higher wages and shorter hours from the men who owned and ran the system . The other division of the labor army has lately ventured to challenge the entire existing scheme of control . Its members demand higher wages and shorter hours , of-course ; but they are thinking of the actual direction of the productive machine itself . Led by such men as Sidney Hillman in the East and James Duncan in the West , they have been making enormous strides during the past year , and they have now definitely shaken the grip of the old leaders on the unions themselves . But this is a movement not essentially of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders frankly can not control it . It has dominated a half-dozen important labor conventions during the past six months . It has forced the hand of Mr. Gompers on the Plumb plan . It underlies the steel strike . Thanks to the war , we stand today in the presence of a revolutionary force which our captains of industry have now determined definitely to challenge  --  they would have had to challenge it some day . That , as we believe , is the meaning of this great steel strike . In such a view , the immediate issues of the struggle ( and we regard this one as only typical of hundreds of others ) sink into relative unimportance , however large the.questions of fairness and justice they may raise , and however seriously they may affect the fortunes of individuals . The real question for intelligent men to consider is , Can this mass movement be resisted ? Many thoughtful men among our business leaders regard mere unbending opposition as neither practicable nor desirable . We believe that they are right . The world has seen political power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ill , we appear to be witnessing a similar transfer of power in the industrial world . The question accordingly is not , Shall the power pass , but , How shall the power pass ? Shall it be with violence and bloodshed and hatred , or shall it be with goodwill and consideration and mutual assistance ? That the transfer of power will mean profound changes in the existing system of private property is evident enough , even though we can not forecast the exact details . We yield to none in our estimate of the role of private property in the civilized order . For that reason we would not see the whole fortress imperilled by unthinking attempts to defend outlying and indefensible bastions , even though certain possessors under our existing arrangements are bound to suffer when the old positions are abandoned . Both Great Britain and our own country are faced by a demand from powerful bodies of workers for the nationalization of railroads and mines  --  and the end clearly is not yet . The truest friend of private property today is not he who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he who insists on examining critically what is and what is not properly to be included within the category of property ; for that is the method of reason , and it is to reason , not violence , that we must look for the direction and control of this new force whose manifestations we are beginning to witness on every hand. - As we see the great scroll unroll before our eyes , then , we feel that it is no time for panic terror or for violent denunciation of either side . We desire for the on-coming Y millions patience and self-restraint and readiness to think ; and on the side of those whose privilege and power are undergoing radical change the clear eye and the quiet mind and the ability to judge what is and what is not possible . ii Forcible repression throughout all history has ultimately ? bred extreme and violent reprisal . Communist Russia today is the child of generations of ruthless political tyranny . Looking at our own situation , can we not all realize that the brains , the organizing ability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idealism of the American business man are too precious to be wasted in class war ? Let not the worker thoughtlessly crowd such a possible ally to the wall , or drive him into open armed conflict ; and let not the business man by indirection or lack of frankness or stubborn insistence on the unchanging maintenance of what the war has made an untenable status goad the worker to violent revolt . For the old dominance based solely on ownership is passing before our eyes : " but whosoever will be great among you , let him be your minister ; and whosoever ? will be chief among you , let him be your servant . " Mr. Wilson Rants T ERY well then , if we must stand apart and be the hostile V rival of the rest of the world , then we must do something else , we must be physically ready for anything that comes . We must have a great standing army . We must see to it that every man in America is trained to arms . We must see to it that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means a mobilized nation . . . . We may say what we please of the German Government that has been destroyed , my fellow citizens , but it was the only sort of government that could handle an armed nation . You ca n't handle an armed nation by vote . You ca n't handle an armed nation if it is democratic , because democracies do n't go to war that way . You have got to have a concentrated , militaristic organization of government to run a nation of that sort . Thus , Woodrow Wilson on Friday , September 5 , 1919 . Was there ever so pitiful an appeal ? We have just finished a war against a government which has been portrayed to us innocent Americans as the lowest type of government to which any modern nation has ever sunk . The world , Mr. Wilson assured us , did not have room for two systems of government  --  the German and that of the rest of the world . As long as the " Potsdam gang " existed there could be safety for neither democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain the kind of league he wants the President turns around and deliberately tells us that if we do not get it , there is no other possibility before us than to go ahead and reorganize ourselves precisely on the lines of the German government we have destroyed . It is the only possible form of government , he declares , when all the world is against one . But were not the German people made by their base leaders to believe that all the world was against them ; that England was jealous of their industrial and sea power ; that Russia and France were formally allied against them ? What will they say now when they read in cold type the news of Mr. Wilson 's latest utterance , his statement that if the League of Nations fails we must make over our precious American democracy on the Prussian autocratic model , and must become a militaristic nation in arms , with our Bernhardi , our Ludendorff , our Hindenburg , our ? Tirpitz ? We are to store up arms within the nation , Mr. Wilson says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to date so that they may be used tomorrow . " We shall not only , he declares , have to pay enormous additional taxes ; we shall have to make over our country into the only kind of organization that can handle armies of that sort . What could be more misleading or more misjudged ? If the militaristic government of Germany was what this country believed it to be , there can be no excuse on earth for imitating it . For a century , in accordance with the advice of George Washington , the United States stood alone , free from entanglements . It never found it necessary during that time to build up great armaments . To insinuate in the face of such a history that if the League of Nations fails we must out-German Germany , is enough to make the very dead in Flanders rise . What abominable disloyalty to the Americans who lie in France to admit that under certain circumstances  --  which might come about by the collapse of the League even if the treaty were adopted by the Senate  --  it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What disloyalty this to the fathers of this Republic ! That Mr. Wilson should stoop to such an argument proves , like his harping upon the epithet pro-German , that he has come to despair of success . That he should thinkfor one moment that Americans ought to lower themselves to the level of the Hohenzollern conception of government ! Every American , with or without his country 's ancient ideals at heart , knows that we must not follow the example of our recent enemy , not only because she so greatly harmed the rest of the world by her war-making , but because in the end it was she that was most harmed by it . Of course Mr. Wilson can not himself realize what he has said , especially if he is at all conscious of what is going on in the world . It is merely that he senses defeat and is resorting to the last trick of the orator , in the hope of frightening the Senators to do his will . We do not believe that many Americans will be misled by such fustian . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America of the future does not have to choose between becoming a party to that colossal humbug , the proposed League of Nations , or becoming a second Germany . They know perfectly well that it is not necessary to choose either of these evils ; that the United States can go on with its national life calmly awaiting the day of a sound international order and an honest league of nations without having to be armed to the teeth . The thoughtful among them have come to understand that it is not only war which bankrupts nations and increases social disorder and unrest , but preparation for war as well . They know that if we could stand up under the frightful costs of organizing as a nation in arms , no one else is now , or will be for decades to come , in a position to do so ; that more than one European nation faces bankruptcy , and that two at least would go down if American financial aid were suddenly withdrawn . They have learned from Germany what it means to the spiritual , intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation in arms . Where universal ? military service and large armaments have existed , there unrest has spread like wildfire  --  and most Americans are not desiring a rapid increase of social unrest in America just at this moment . They know what it has meant to the workers of Europe to carry each a soldier on his back , and they have no intention whatever of permitting America to be reorganized on any such lines even if the treaty is rejected . But , after all , the saddest thing about it all is that the author of the Fourteen Points should have sunk to this depth for the sake of the League . In the same speech from which we have taken the above quotation Mr. Wilson boldly told the truth that this was a commercial and economic war and not a political one . Had he been a private citizen and said this during the war he would probably have gone to jail like Eugene Debs ; for to say that the war was " economic and commercial " is but another way of declaring that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed by Mr. Burleson to say . What are we to think when Mr. Wilson assures us that the kind of government that Germany had was " the only sort of government that could handle an armed nation " ? Does it mean that the veil of lying and falsehood which has obscured what has happened during the last four years is now to be torn away by some of those who are most responsible for it ? Let us hope so . But whatever happens we have no such low and ugly opinion of the American people as Mr. Wilson . We are too sure and too proud of their idealism and the essential soundness of their moral and intellectual fibre to believe that they would ever consider for a moment a course which could only be accepted as a justification of the Kaiser and all his works . TThe Poets and the Peace HE poets are turning away from the peace . Most of them sounded to battle and still more of them acclaimed the armistice , but now we get from them notes of disappointment , disillusion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' soldiers ask , that we fought those battles ; was it for this negation of our vision , ask the poets , that we took wings out of our dreaveto lead the hearts of youth thrOugh filth and death for sake of that vision ? What the soldiers and the poets seek for is , of course , not a settlement whiCh shall reward therri for their ardors and endurances but one which shall make it clear that they did not burn and endure in a cause which was wrong or foolish , or , worse , in a cause which did not exist at all . They can forgive us , those who still lth and those who died , if we forget them now , but they can never for0v , e , if they discover . that they were all the time only the ' tips of an ' Order of affair 's which they thought had passe This is a good occasion'to remember the career of Wordsworth . In September , 1790 , he had been stirred by the jOy and benevolence which he fotind everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Blois in 1792 , under the instruction of Captain Beaupuy , he became thoroughly converted to the new ideals of lihertY , and took back with him to England a passiOnate sympathy with the French . ? What , then , were my emotions , when in arms Britain put forth her freebo4n strength in'league , Oh , pity and shame ! with those confederate Powers ! Not in my single self alone I found , But in the minds of all ingenuous youth , Change and subversion from that hour . . . . Oh ! much have they to account for , who could tear By violence , at one decisive rent , From the best youth in England their dear pride , Their joy , in England . With what grief , Wordsworth says , he heard prayers in church for victory , and with what a shock to his moral nature did he find himself positively exulting over the defeats which the British at first sustained . He saw the most violent party in France strengthened by a foreign invasion , and growing daily more violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deserted sometimes , he felt , by his own soul . But a little before , it had been blisSful to be alive , heavenly to be young , at what seemed the great dawn . But now , for the first time in his life thrown outside the " pale of love " in which his spirit had heretofore moved , he found his moods embittered and unhinged . The French themselves , advancing from-self-defence to-conquest , struck another prop away . Hip . O'ld confidence that virtue and reason must prevail almost wholly faded , and he went down to the last depths of contempt and doubt , from which he was rescued only by his escape , under the guidance of his sister , out of the storm into the calmer weather of his native hills . That Wordsworth 's greatest work was done after his secession from the world no one can deny ; nor can one prove that had he remained he could better have served the interests of humanity than by doing in quiet what he was perhaps best fitted to do . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced such anti.cnom : reason and love retired in the mountains , preju'di d hatred active on the plains . For the uses Of poetry are infinite . In " The Birds of Killingwor the slaughter in some stout of all the birds , with the consequ who had killed them for the sake of the grain theymight eat , saw a thousand times as much devoured by the insects , which the birds would certainly have eaten . But there are worse ways of banning the poets than shooting them  --  they may be stifled by extracting from the air they breathe the freedom and the love and the ' hope'without which they can not with all his power against the daily horrors of the trenches . In America read what Witter Bynner and Edgar Lee Masters are saying . Everywhere authentic voices sounding revolt ; everywhere pure spirits alienated by the obtuseness and confusion and malice of the times . Just before the war there was beginning in this country a poetical movement more widespread , more intense , more concerned with actual life than any we had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Will it be reserved for the peace to end it or to force it once more away to some Alp or Eden of the fancy ? The CoOperative I ? ewspaper T HAT the newspaper world would escape the prevailing unrest was not , of course , to be expected . But it had not been believed that writers for the press would be as rapidly organized as has been the case . Boston seems to have led off , and the successful strike for higher pay there gave a marked impetus to the movement for collective bargaining . In Montreal , the Newswriters ' Union marched in the Labor Day parade ; in Philadelphia the union has 165 members ; while in Rochester more than three-fourths of the reporters and editors have organized and affiliated with the International Typographical Union , demanding a minimum wage of $50 a week for experienced reporters . In New Haven , as everywhere else , the proprietors have opposed the unions , which action resulted in a strike that temporarily crippled the city 's dailies and has led to the interesting result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has now made its appearance for several days , is reported to have the backing ' of certain capitalists to the extent of $150,000 . It is an interesting experiment , not only because it is a novel venture in the East , but because it is along the lines of the new policy that the workers should control the industry in which they work . We have had many suggestions for the betterment of the press  --  the press which has never failed America as sadly as in the last few years  --  but the discussion has usually revolved about projects for endowed newspapers or official publications . No one has yet succeeded in convincing students of the problem that the endowed newspaper would be any better off than our trustee-controlled colleges have been ; and as for the official paper , the mischief done by inspired governmental propaganda in this country during the war ought forever to banish that idea from everybody 's head . A government press could have no other purpose than to color the news and . interpret all happenings for the benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in office and desired to continue their benevolent rule . Even in - Russia and Bavaria , where we have had " proletariaia " governments in control of the press , the result has been the same  --  a refusal to let the other side state its case , or enjoy real freedom of the press . Hence , all efforts to find a way out become of enormous importance . If the New Haven reporters can prove that they can produce an honest , able , and impartial newspaper and make a success Of it they will have rendered a service to encourage everybody . If they write from any point of view except the , printing of the whole truth they will merely disappoint . The propagandist newspaper like The New York Call undoubtedly has its place , particularly when it is as honestly and ably condUcted as that paper ; butafter all it writes as - much frOrn one point of view as does its antithesis The New York ? Times , If the strugiling New Haven paper desires to serve special interests or to serve only the cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But here we have a perplexing difficulty . If a newspaper merely prints the naked truth and espouses no cause , if it is not written with a passion for righteousness , for some reform or some policy , it can not make a deep impress . The problem is to make the news columns absolutely fair and unbiased and really informatory while giving free hand to the editorial writers who furnish the paper with its individuality and its warmth . It is no easy task , yet the elder Bowles and the younger , too , shoWed that it can be done in America . In the West various interesting experiments are under way . Thus the Nonpartisan League is founding several newspapers whose capital has been or is to be subscribed in small amounts by a large number of sympathizers . To some extent these are cooperative enterprises . But perhaps the most interesting experiment anywhere is The Union Record ( Seattle ) , the labor daily which , on the President 's arrival in that city , dared , to the horror of the correspondents accompanying him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he dared not answer . The naive astonishment of Mr. David Lawrence , for instance , in discovering this daily with its growing circulation of 60,000 and , what is more important , with its opinions that are different from the conventional and with its refusal to bow down before the President , afforded the public one of the most delightful bits of unconscious humor that has appeared in the press of late . The remarkable thing about this newspaper is that it has made money ever since the beginning of its third month and that it is dependent upon no one for a subsidy . In this respect it is in marked contrast with the new London labor daily , The Herald , which is financed by several rich men . The Union Record rejoices in several pages of advertising , but , as a headline states , the paper is " published for principle and not for profit . " Its chief reliance is upon small classified advertising , and it declares that if it can obtain two or three pages a day it will be independent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United Press . In style and type it imitates the make-up of its capitalist rivals . But apparently its editors can pride themselves upon having shown the possibility of making a success of a paper without the aid of the capitalist . That unfortunate person , who is now receiving mercy at nobody 's hands , has begun , perhaps , to see the handwriting on the wall ; at least we note that the new owner of The RefrubliCan-Herald ( BinghamtOn ) , the oldest newspaper in its section of New York State , has announced that whatever profits it makes will be equally , divided between the workers and the proprietor . Autumn 's Epidemic BOUT this time of year , when the air becomes bracing and the World 's Series falls due , the spirit of specula-tion seems to revive , and its channela of communication between man and nian seem to multiply miraculously . One can place a bet , on almost anything with almOst anyone . We have done Pretty well with the Unearned increment this summer , in our humble way , already ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and kelley pool has assayed above the average , day in and day out . Under these circumstances , we are moved by the afflatus of the changing season to take a real sporting chance . Jake , the office-boy , who ( we hear with misgivings ) is becoMing prominent in the Brownsville socialist junior lockl , has just been in the sanctum , taunting us with our well-known reactionary tendencies , ? alas ; duaintiest ista hominuin glaria , how vain such a distinction nowadays ! ? and offering , in hiS sinful slangy way , to chance a couple of dollars that the first thing done by the President 's labor conference next month will be to deMand quick action on the treaty . He says that the conference is primarily minatory ; that its real purpose is to coerce the United States Senate , or " to sandbag them old geezers " ( we regretfully reproduce his exact language ) into ratifying the treaty , by threat of throwing on them the onus of withstanding a settlement of the industrial situation . We mention merely by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our office discipline , that Jake 's reflections on the men chosen by the President to represent the general public at this conference , amounted to sheer scurrility . We can not fire Jake ; an office-boy , in these days , can not be replaced . So we are at his mercy and obliged at times to bear in silence with a most disrespectful and shocking irruption of his improper opinions . Just now , for example , we heard with acute distress his animadversions on these fine exemplars of the democratic tradition . Who , we asked him , more nearly represents the-composite genius . of our people , more truly communicates that imponderable and undefinable quality known as the American spirit , than Mr. Bernard M. Baruch or Mr. John D. Rockefeller , Jr. ? If the President had asked a plebiscite , would not a first and unanimous choice of the plain people have fallen upon that sterling democrat , that genial and conciliating upholder of the public interests , Judge Gary ? Is not Mr. Brookings a trustee of the Carnegie Institute and the Carnegie Peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International Harvester Company , and Mr. Meredith a graduate of the Board of Excess Profit Advisers ? We asked further , what more the President could have done to placate the radical element , how he could make more manifest the spotless impartiality and catholicity of his intentions , than by appointing those two apostles of sound radical doctrine whose names are in the hagiology of every socialist household of faith , Messrs . John Spargo and Charles Edward RUssell . But at the mention of these two names , Jake became almost abusive , muttering some incoherent words which we did not care to hear too distinctly , but the terms which forced themselves oil mfr ears seemed to indicate there must be a serious split in the Brownsville junior local . We took Jake 's bet , par* to get rid of him and partly influenced by the seasonal COnditions ; but we are afraid we may loSe and are lbOlcin ardiind fora chance to hedg.e , for two dollars means much in Grub Street .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
