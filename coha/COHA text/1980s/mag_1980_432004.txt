Museum of Modern Art Museum of Modern F. Balla 's Street Light , ' Severini 's Bal Tabarin ' : Putting the spectator in the center of the picture ' ART The Art of Future Shock W e intend to exalt aggressive action , a feverish insomnia , the racer 's stride , the mortal leap , the punch and the slap . " Thus did the Italian poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti announce in 1909 the birth of futurism , the first of the twentieth century 's noisy avant-garde movements and one that proved to be a model for all the others , from Dada and surrealist performances through beat-generation poetry readings and happenings to punk-rock concerts . Though the quantity of strictly futurist work produced was small and its quality frequently uneven , the concept of futurism altered the course of art for decades to come . The last big show of futurism was at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1961 , and it was limited to Italian artists . Now the Philadelphia Museum of Art has staged another , of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all to the good . An all-Italian show might be as hard to digest as the goodies described in Marinetti 's cookbook , " La Cucina Futuristica , " such as mortadella with nougat , or an aphrodisiac made from pineapple juice , eggs , cocoa , caviar , almond paste , red pepper , cloves and Strega ? a cocktail that evokes one of the wackier pictures in this show , Gino Severini 's " Dynamic Hieroglyphic of the Bal Tabarin . " " Futurism and the International AvantGarde " examines not only the Italian movement but also parallel developments in France , Russia , Germany , England and America . Unfortunately , it wo n't be traveling anywhere after it closes in Philadelphia on Jan. 4 . Put together on rather short notice when works from the Museum of Modern Art and the famous private collection of Dr. and Mrs. Barnett Malbin of New York suddenly became available , it makes do without loans from Italy and therefore lacks a number of key pictures , such as Carlo Carra 's portrait of Marinetti and Giacomo Balla 's " Girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ futurism 's first masterpiece , Umberto Boccioni 's " The City Rises , " which was reported damaged in the Museum of Modern Art fire of 1958 and does not usually travel . Stress Signals : Still , a number of major Italian works are on view , including Balla 's vibrating dachshund called " Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash , " which has become almost a logo of the futurist movement . Also present is Boccioni 's series of three pictures called " States of Mind , " a welter of splintered railway imagery and emotive stress signals , and altogether one of the most cohesive and persuasive futurist statements in paint . There is Carra 's " Funeral of the Anarchist Galli , " an assuredly futurist work by this artist who often seems tempted by the relative stability of cubism . There are strong pictures ( " Dynamism of an Automobile " ) as well as weak ones by the uneven Luigi Russolo , who was also a composer fond of inflicting cruel and unusual punishment on concert audiences with his " noise intoners . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting " Daily Domestic Arguments " ( inspired by Richard Strauss 's " Sinfonia Domestica " ) is almost abstract except for some discs apparently meant to represent Hying crockery . Before there was futurism there was a manifesto , the brainchild of Marinetti , a dapper , wealthy , Egyptian-born poet with a Barnum-like gift for self-promotion . His first objective was to dethrone the reigning showman of Italian letters , Gabriele d'Annunzio , whose work Marinetti called " the Monte Carlo of all literatures . " His weapon for doing so was the first futurist manifesto ( the first in a long series , as it turned out ) , which he managed to get printed on the front page of the conservative French newspaper Le Figaro . A few months later another manifesto , called " Let 's Kill the Moonlight , " listed the painters Boccioni , Carra , Russolo , Balla 118 NEWSWEEK/NOVEMBER 10 , 1980 and Severini as futurists . As yet , however , there was no futurist art , only Marinetti 's violent prescriptions for it . Among these were the deification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace ' " ) ; rhetorical sword rattling ( " war ? the world 's only hygiene " ) , which foreshadowed Fascism , and exhortations to destroy the culture of the past by flooding museums and burning libraries . It was up to the painters to build an art on this tabula rasa , and they hastily set about doing so , with visually diverse results . Their declared aims were " to put the spectator in the center of the picture , " " to show the living object in its dynamic growth " and to make art " the synthesis of what one remembers and what one sees . " This meant characterizing an object by its movement or potential for it , using overlapping planes and " lines of force " to ? represent it enmeshed in its surroundings , as in Russolo 's " Memories of a Night , " where a horse in the distance seems to cast its shadow on a female profile in the foreground . Finding Parallels : The show was organized by curator Anne d'Harnoncourt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period piece to a still-vital anthology of international vanguard art of the time , much of it only remotely influenced by futurist art but all of it somehow indebted to futurist theories . Her knack for finding parallels among widely divergent works of art ( such as Boccioni 's portraits of his mother and Picasso 's " weeping women " of the ' 20s ) and for unearthing little-known but relevant examples keeps the exhibition consistently lively . For instance , the American section has a work by the only American artist known to have exhibited in Italy with the futurists , a certain Frances Stevens Simpson , about whom little is known except that she also had a New York show in 1916 . The picture , her only surviving one , is called " Dynamic Velocity of Interborough Rapid Transit Boccioni 's Unique Forms* : Masterpiece Power Station , " and it 's exciting in the vein of the futurist architect Sant'Elia 's visionary renderings ? though the mere fact that an artist could draw inspiration from a New York subway is indicative of how far in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in the United States : John Marin 's etching of the Brooklyn Bridge , Max Weber 's " A Comprehension of the Grand Central Terminal , " James R. Daugherty 's " Three Base Hit ( Opening Game ) " and Joseph Stella 's " Battle of Lights , Coney Island , " whose fractured Ferris wheels and seething chromatics are closest in spirit to the Italian models . In fact , it is finally the peripheral works ? especially those by Matisse , Picasso , Gris , Malevich , Duchamp and Duchamp-Villon ? that tend to upstage the work of the futurists themselves . One leaves with the impression that the futurists ' strenuous cultivation of modernity yielded its true fruits elsewhere . Great Artifacts : Yet if Carra and Severini , despite flashes of brilliance , appear to be no more than gifted second-rate artists and Russolo seldom even that , if Balla is more commanding in his pre-futurist phase ( in works like the eerie , divisionist " Street Light ( Electric Light ) " and " The Stairway of Farewells " ) , there remains the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ styles and mediums , he could at times be maddeningly perverse . The bust of his mother , called " Anti-Graceful , " with its expression that shifts with the spectator 's viewpoint and its details like the fragment of window frame seemingly imbedded in her scalp , remains a laborious conceit , beautifully executed . Yet the striding figure called " Unique Forms of Continuity in Space , " which looks clad in flames , and a no-less-magnificent bronze still life called " Development of a Bottle in Space " are among the greatest artifacts the century has to offer . So are the " States of Mind " pictures and " Dynamism of a Soccer Player , " Boccioni 's last large painting , in which an athlete 's figure in motion is dissolved to the point of abstraction . So too are many of his drawings from a group that forms a separate show within a show at Philadelphia . These alone would excuse the excesses of his other work and of the futurist adventure as a whole . Seeing Boccioni anthologized makes one realize what a loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how ironic it was that this eulogist of speed and machinery should die from a fall off a horse that had been frightened by a locomotive .
