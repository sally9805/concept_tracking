 | Asked once to what he owed his longevity , John Huston quipped : " Surgery . " It was a typically unsentimental Hustonian answer , its bluntness masking reticence . But it did n't begin to account for the vast reserves of will , guile , luck and sheer Rabelaisian lust for life that kept the octogenarian moviemaker alive and kicking long after other , less tenacious men would have retired . Last week Huston 's Irish luck finally ran out . Long plagued by emphysema , recently recovered from pneumonia , he died in his sleep in Newport , R.I. , where he was acting as executive producer on his son Danny 's movie " Mr. North . " He was 81 . A gambler , sportsman , art collector , womanizer , actor , screenwriter and world-class film director , Huston had by the end divested himself of most of his worldly possessions , including his beloved estate St. Clerans in Ireland . All that remained was his book collection . But he left behind a cinematic legacy and a personal legend that wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adaptation of a short story he had long cherished , James Joyce 's " The Dead , " directed from a wheelchair , written by his son Tony , starring his daughter Anjelica . Perhaps this final film will take its place among the unforgettable Huston movies of the past ? " The Maltese Falcon , " The Treasure of the Sierra Madre , " " The Asphalt Jungle , " " The African Queen , " " Beat the Devil , " " Fat City , " " The Man Who Would Be King , " " Prizzi 's Honor . " No hiding place : Both by temperament and geography , John Huston stood at arm 's length from Hollywood , preferring to spend many years in exile in Ireland and Mexico . His movies subverted Hollywood 's most cherished romantic myths . Not for him the tender love story and the happy fade-out . His was a skeptical , modernist sensibility nurtured on Joyce and Hemingway and Picasso . You can read his filmography as a long salute to doomed outcasts . In his masculine world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or godhood or victory in the boxing ring ? and found dusty defeat at the end of the trail . A thin line separated his heroes from his villains , and love offered no hiding place : in the Huston world , women , from Mary Astor in " The Maltese Falcon " to Kathleen Turner in " Prizzi 's Honor , " were more likely to betray their men than to nurture them . Ironically , his most popular movie , " The African Queen , " is his least typical : a love story with good guys , evil villains and a happy ending to boot . The son of actor Walter Huston ? who won an Oscar for " Sierra Madre " ? and journalist Rhea Gore , Huston had an unusually nomadic childhood . His parents separated when Huston was three , and he shuttled back and forth between the then poverty-stricken world of his father and the luxurious life of his mother , a woman who loved gambling and travel and horses . " She taught me that money 's for spending and to hell with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sickly child , he was sent to a sanitarium and told he had to be cautious for the rest of his life . He challenged his fear by sneaking out night after night to ride the steep waterfall of a nearby stream . When the doctors discovered his adventures , they declared him well . It was a turning point . Three years later he quit high school and became an amateur boxer . He continued to burn his candle at both ends , through five marriages ? one , to the actress Evelyn Keyes , little more than a drunken , impetuous lark ? spending money as fast as he could make it . Lanky , tough and elegant , an existential figure before the term became fashionable , he lived by his instincts , joining the Mexican cavalry as a young man , spontaneously adopting a Mexican orphan while making " Sierra Madre , " openly criticizing the Hollywood blacklist . Orson Welles described him as " playing Mephistopheles to his own Faust . " The point is , he played both roles with relish . Bouncing back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood 's greats , his reputation waned during the ' 50s and ' 60s . There were too many indifferent films such as " The Barbarian and the Geisha " and " Sinful Davy , " and overreaches like " Freud . " But Huston kept bouncing back , first with the gritty boxing saga , " Fat City , " then with his great Kipling tale " The Man Who Would Be King " and the daring , offbeat adaptation of Flannery O'Connor 's " Wise Blood . " The jewel in the crown for Huston must have been the acclaim ? and the Oscar for his daughter Anjelica ? occasioned by the dark comic brilliance of " Prizzi 's Honor . " Perhaps the archetypal Huston movie moment ? and one that has been imitated by his descendants from Stanley Kubrick to Sam Peckinpah to Robert Altman ? is the scorching peal of laughter that ends " The Treasure of the Sierra Madre , " as the gold so desperately sought blows away in the wind . But if John Huston 's art took a cool , sardonic survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risky life proved just the opposite : that with enough guts , talent and style , living could be a movable feast . The last laugh , a deep Hustonian chortle , was his . @#
