When Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping visited Houston last year , Rancher John Joyce gave him a Texas-size souvenir : a 1,000-lb. champion brahma bull worth $10,000 . Joyce also handed Deng a letter offering to sell more bulls , if China was shopping . <P> Since then Joyce has called the Texas and U.S. Departments of Agriculture and written to the Chinese consulate in Houston for instructions about what to do with the bull , but has received no replies . Last week an official of the Chinese embassy in Washington said that the " matter is still under consideration " and that he is still waiting for orders from Peking . Meanwhile , Joyce said , he is " tired of feeding the bull , " which since Deng 's visit has gained 400 lbs . on a $2.50-a-day diet of corn , cottonseed hulls , molasses , oats and a protein supplement .
