At first there were varying explanations for the small scab on the right side of the President 's nose . It was described by White House Spokesman Larry Speakes as the result of " skin irritation , a gathering of skin , a piling up of skin , " possibly aggravated by " an allergic reaction " to adhesive tape that had held a naso-gastric tube in place following Reagan 's surgery last month for colon cancer . Actually , it was a bit more than that , as the President himself finally admitted . " I had , well , I guess for want of a better word , a pimple , " he explained last week . " I was informed that it has been examined by biopsy and it was indeed a basal-cell carcinoma , the most common and least dangerous kind of cancer . " <P> So common , in fact , that Reagan was not the only American leader reported last week to be afflicted with it . Former President Richard Nixon , it was revealed , underwent treatment two weeks ago to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , approximately 500,000 Americans a year develop skin cancer , and the overwhelming majority of these are basal-cell carcinomas , usually small , pearly nodules that sometimes become red , crusty lesions and appear most often on the face . " The sun is responsible for almost all of them , " says Dr. Perry Robins , a New York University dermatologist and president of the Skin Cancer Foundation . <P> Because of their age , their ancestry and their many years in the California sunshine , both Reagan , 74 , and Nixon , 72 , are typical victims . The risk of developing skin cancer increases with age and years of exposure to the sun 's ultraviolet rays . In the U.S. , one Caucasian in seven will be stricken during his lifetime . Skin cancer is hundreds of times more common among whites than blacks and is especially common in those of Northern European extraction , with Irish Americans like Reagan at particularly high risk . <P> Promptly removed , basal-cell carcinomas rarely pose a danger . There are several methods for getting rid of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth on Nancy Reagan 's upper lip in 1982 , were excised by a procedure called curettage and electrodesiccation ( see diagram ) that usually takes five minutes . In this method , the dermatologist applies a local anesthetic and then scrapes away the soft , mushy tumor cells with a curette , an instrument with a sharp circular blade . Afterward , an electrified needle is applied to the area to destroy any remnants of malignancy . In the case of Nixon 's l-in. - sq. tumor , a method called microscopically controlled surgery was used . The process calls for the removal of successive slices of tissue , each of which is examined under a microscope until cancerous cells are no longer observed . <P> Other types of skin cancer can pose a greater threat . Squamous-cell carcinomas generally appear as raised , pinkish scaly patches . If not promptly treated , 5% of them metastasize to other tissues and organs . Most deadly of all is malignant melanoma , which typically begins as a dark , unevenly pigmented spot with irregular edges and can quickly spread to invade internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5,500 . Though heredity and a medical history of unusual moles play a part in it , evidence suggests that serious , blistering sunburns , suffered during the first two decades of life , may also increase susceptibility.
