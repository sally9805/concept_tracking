He was the Caliban of the concrete wilderness , a tough-minded , quick-fisted , devilishly engaging city sprite , the first such in movie history and still , a half-century later , the best . One minute he would be walking the dark side of the mean streets , personifying the gangster as a tragically overreaching hero ( The Public Enemy ) ; the next he was to be found quickstepping on his jaunty dancer 's pins along the sunny side , tapping out a dandy Yankee Doodle up tune . But it made no difference where he traded slick jabs and smart-mouthed gibes , for he always made it clear that though he could be touched , he could not be trifled with or , at his core , changed . <P> Later , when the world changed , he permitted his tough guy to give off the rancid odors of psychopathy , notably in White Heat . But his actor 's integrity remained unsullied . He would make us understand his characters , but he would never seek pity for them . <P> Now 82 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film , after a 21-year absence , James Cagney is unchanged at heart . <P> Though slowed by diabetes , he is a cherubic figure , a twinkly-eyed grandfatherly sort , full of benign anecdotes about his past ( and a convenient lack of memory for past frictions ) . The old attack is still there . Indeed , the cunning professional is more than ever capable of playing games with the audience , using his softened image for deceptive purposes . Until he whispers his last devastating line in Ragtime , the audience is likely to think of Police Commissioner Rheinlander Waldo as an agreeable authority figure , when he is actually the picture 's symbol of evil genius . <P> Not that Cagney would ever admit to doing anything all that complicated or rationally thought out . His strongest admiration is for people who make things look easy . Packey McFarland , a prizefighter from his youth , comes to mind : <P> " He was my idol , because he did it all and never got a black eye . " Of his own acting , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I was generally the hoodlum , and I understood that type perfectly well . No strain . " <P> No strain . It is a phrase that has been recurring to Cagney for as long as people have been trying to inquire into the nature of his gift . " Just a job " is another one , used to describe almost any role anyone asks about . Says Ragtime Director Milos Forman : " At first I was suspicious , but no , it is absolutely genuine . His humility toward work-that is just him . I know the word is abused , but I really think James is some kind of genius . His instincts are phenomenal . As a director , I do n't have to tell him a thing . Could stay home . " <P> Despite Ragtime ( made at his doctor 's suggestion and Forman 's urging ) , Cagney , too , could stay home . He has never enjoyed self-promotion , preferring the quiet of his 800-acre farm near Amenia , N.Y . The comfortable stone house is as simple and solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , Billie , occasionally entertain friends like Mikhail Baryshnikov but venture forth only rarely . They journeyed to the White House when Ragtime was screened for the President , and this week at the New York Press Club , Cagney will memorialize his old friend Robert Montgomery , who died in September . He is also considering another movie role , as an aging Bat Masterson.
