Eastern Airlines ' tortuous path has taken it through multimillion-dollar losses into a crippling strike and the refuge of bankruptcy court . Now its fate rests with a powerful judge known for biting sarcasm , a penchant for popcorn and a determination to get the airline flying again . In the nearly two months since Burton R. Lifland has been overseeing Eastern ' s reorganization , his actions have chafed the carrier and its lawyers . Even representatives of Eastern ' s unions , who applaud many of Lifland ' s decisions , privately call him " a loose cannon . " Lifland , 60 , has a style that some lawyers and acquaintances privately say borders on the eccentric . In one tense , closed-door negotiation , he made bowls of popcorn for everybody . His courtroom utterances are liberally sprinkled with humor and jibes . He can reduce high-powered , haughty attorneys to the level of red-faced , stammering schoolboys standing nervously before him . Besides the rows of law books lining the walls , a huge poster of Rumpole of the Bailey , the fictional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal bankruptcy courthouse . The high-ceilinged rooms in the turn-of-the-century Customs House Building in lower Manhattan command a splendid view of the Hudson River . Lifland rarely talks to reporters and declined to be interviewed . As the chief U.S. bankruptcy judge for the Southern District of New York , Lifland has presided over some of the biggest and most complex cases in history . They include former asbestos maker Manville Corp. , steelmaker LTV Corp. and farm machinery maker Allis-Chalmers Corp . He ' s a graduate of Syracuse University and Fordham University Law School , and frequently lectures at law schools and legal conferences . Lifland ' s primary concern for the last two months has been Eastern , since parent Texas Air Corp. put it into Chapter 11 protection from creditors March 9 , five days after a crippling strike . In the Eastern case , as in others , Lifland has departed from the historically neutral role many bankruptcy judges take , in the view of some lawyers . " He has been interventionist at the far end of the spectrum , " said Karen Gross , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the National Bankruptcy Institute . Early in the case , Lifland ordered the appointment of a bankruptcy examiner for Eastern with extraordinary powers . He later ordered all parties to explain why he shouldn ' t put the airline up for auction . He continually has said it ' s in the public interest to get Eastern back to a full schedule quickly . " What I ' m hearing is a reflection of parochial interests ; what I ' m not hearing is the public interest here , " Lifland scolded attorneys for Eastern and the unions at one hearing . " The public is a main player here , " he said , citing the consumers who " have scrimped and saved " to buy Eastern tickets and can ' t use them . Statements like that have riled a number of bankruptcy attorneys who are not involved in the Eastern case but say they are worried about precedents that may be set by Lifland . Some believe the judge has lost his impartiality , has sided with Eastern ' s unions and is pushing the airline into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s public interest argument , asserting that a bankruptcy court is charged only with protecting the interests of creditors and shareholders . The public , they say , can find seats on other airlines if needed . " He ' s grandstanding and that ' s counterproductive , " said a bankruptcy attorney unconnected with the Eastern case who requested anonymity . Even union representatives , who have liked many of Lifland ' s moves , complain privately that he has raised their expectations too high and has subsequently backed down on several occasions . " He really has painted himself into a corner ; there doesn ' t seem to be any easy way out of it , " said a union team member who asked not to be identified . " Bankruptcy judges do not do heroic things very often . " In mid-April , sources say , Lifland was persuaded under pressure to back down when he came close to appointing a powerful temporary trustee to run Eastern , which in effect would have invalidated management ' s authority . The trustee issue was at the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s $464 million deal to buy Eastern from Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo . Eastern ' s three unions , which had agreed to accept a reported $210 million in labor concessions in exchange for a 30 percent share in the airline , insisted on a trustee to replace Lorenzo before Ueberroth took over . Lorenzo refused to accept the appointment of a trustee , which is rarely done in bankruptcy cases and usually implies fraud or mismanagement by a company ' s bosses . Sources say Eastern ' s lead bankruptcy attorney , Harvey Miller , mobilized other lawyers to warn Lifland against naming a trustee and the signal that would send . Miller , widely considered one of the most prominent bankruptcy lawyers in the country , declined to comment on the matter . " I think he ( Lifland ) saw he was going to have a battle " if he opted for a trustee , said a source close to the situation . Lifland does have defenders in the legal community , however . " I know him to be a dedicated , sincere judge . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a former bankruptcy judge who is now an attorney in Miami . Lifland is trying to find a timely solution to revive Eastern , he said . The judge ' s razor-sharp humor is relentless . In one hearing , after making a lengthy speech , Miller somberly presented a towering stack of documents to Lifland . He waved them away , telling the attorney , " I had planned to devour a Robert Ludlum novel tonight . " On another occasion , Lifland expressed disappointment that " no members of the female gender graced " the lawyers ' bench at that particular hearing . At a hearing on Eastern in late April , pilots union attorney Bruce Simon said he was so angered by Miller ' s remarks that " I am moved to stand . " " Would you be less moved if you sat down ? " Lifland shot back . CAPTION : PHOTO : AP Laserphoto . Judge Burton R. Lifland is overseeing Eastern Airline ' s bankruptcy reorganization . Illustration PHOTO <>              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
