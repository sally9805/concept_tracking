Less than a year ago , enraged aldermen barged into the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and snatched from a wall a portrait of the late Mayor Harold Washington in lacy lingerie . Last week the institute was defending another inflammatory exhibit , a work by Scott Tyler , self-proclaimed " supporter of the Revolutionary Communist Party U.S.A. , " titled What Is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag ? Its key component : an American flag stretched out on the floor . The institute claimed that Old Glory was positioned so viewers would not be forced to walk on it . But Joseph Morris , a lawyer for several veterans ' groups , said the exhibit constitutes an " invitation to step on the flag . " The vets , however , failed to persuade Cook County Circuit Judge Kenneth Gillis to close the show , so it reopened to the public Friday , after several days of being viewable only to students , faculty and staff . Security guards allowed only a limited number into the gallery at any one time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag off the floor and holding it up while making speeches . Said James McManus , chairman of the school 's liberal-arts department : " We are trying to defend the notion that all art , provocative art , can be displayed . " That is certainly true at the Art Institute .
