James Wines brings his " de-architecture " to academe <P> A leading architectural historian calls his work " frivolous in the highest degree . " A design educator says he " has the energy and enthusiasm to make the dust fly . " To architecture students , he is both an idol and an idol smasher . James Wines , 51 , seems to be America 's only truly avant-garde architectural designer at a time when the established avant-garde-or the avant-garde establishment-has lost its way . Many eyebrows were raised , therefore , when Wines was appointed to take over this fall as chairman of the environmental and interior design department at the Parsons School of Design in New York City . Critic Ralph Caplan may be understating the case when he says , " Wines ' appointment will bring some excitement to Parsons . " <P> Excitement is needed . In the 1960s design students tended to get too high on social " relevance , " as they called it , to learn much . Now social irrelevance is fashionable ; schools tend to condone a lazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think and create on their own . Parsons , one of the best and largest schools of fashion , graphic , interior and product design , with a New York enrollment of 6,700 and branches in Los Angeles and Paris , is no exception . <P> Wines brings to his new assignment a flair that disturbs some , amuses others and fascinates nearly everyone . He never received formal architectural training but studied art and art history at Syracuse University and thereafter embarked on a successful career as an abstract sculptor . In 1968 , while casting bronze sculpture at a foundry in Long Island City , N.Y. , he met Alison Sky , an experimental sculptor and poet . Two years later , with Photographer-Writer Michelle Stone , they launched a design firm called SITE , an acronym for " sculpture in the environment . " <P> " We agreed that art and architecture had lost contact with people , " said Wines in SITE 's New York office shortly after his appointment to Parsons . Said Sky : " We wanted to create art that relates to its surroundings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Added Wines : " We looked at old buildings in Italy and found that they tell us something-about life , mystery , religion . Modern buildings have lost all meaning . We have to bring art back into architecture , not as decoration . . . " Sky finished the thought with their byword : " . . . but as sculpture in the environment . " <P> SITE at first made paper waves . It flooded art and architecture schools with publications expounding the Wines-Sky message and with exhibits showing unbuilt projects , mostly of buildings blending , melting , seemingly dissolving into their surroundings . The word " de-architecture " was often used . Dadaist Marcel Duchamp 's name was frequently cited as an inspiration . <P> SITE 's first real commission was the renovation of a Best Products Co. showroom in Richmond in 1971 . Best Products is the largest U.S. catalogue showroom merchandiser , with a network of sales outlets that are essentially windowless brick boxes . In Richmond , SITE added a new faade that incongruously and dramatically seemed to be peeling off the box . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
