PEER GYNT <P> by Henrik Ibsen <P> When he wrote Peer Gyntin 1867 , Ibsen did not dream that his epic poem would ever be performed onstage . Uncut , it contains five acts and 38 scenes . Its panoramic sweep embraces four continents : Europe , Africa , North America and Asia . The action unfolds on mountain crests and sun-bleached deserts , within limpid fjords and amid howling sea storms . These requirements have proved daunting to most productions , except that in recent decades stage technology has become much more sophisticated . So has the audience , schooled by the movies ' crosscutting and swift evolution of scenes . <P> Even so , a presentation of Peer Gynt is a rarity . Only 16 full-scale productions are listed for the U.S since 1906 . The two-part , five-hour production now enlivening the stage of Minneapolis ' Guthrie Theater becomes a 17th of considerable distinction . The scenic effects are accomplished with stunning finesse ( heightened by Santo Loquasto 's virtuoso set design of mirrored panels ) . Rumanian Director Liviu Ciulei ( pronounced Leave-you Chew-lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intellectual , philosophical and refreshingly comical ramifications of the play . This Peer Gynt only fitfully moves the heart , however , and that may be because Ciulei chooses to keep a tight Brechtian leash on emotion . <P> On one level , Peer Gynt is a series of picaresque adventures , a kind of Rapscallion 's Progress as opposed to a Pilgrim 's Progress . Yet the rich ambiguity of the play lies in the fact that Peer is some sort of pilgrim . In his most squalid escapades , he knows that he is sinning and fumblingly seeks redemptive grace and the meaning of existence . But since , like Scarlett O'Hara , he puts off thinking about the hard questions until tomorrow , he always loses his way . He traces an allegory of man 's brief bewildering journey from his mother 's womb to Mother Earth . <P> Throughout the play , Peer dichotomizes women . Those of maternal purity , he fears to touch . The accessible slut , he invariably beds . The young Peer of Part I ( rather monotonously played by Greg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his old flames ( Jana Schneider ) . There he meets Solveig ( Jossie de Guzman ) , a girl of 15 or 16 who captivates him but is skittish at his brusque advances . To the end of the play , she will be his undimmed light of love and will incredibly play the combined role of wife and mother figure without the literal consolations of either . <P> The key encounter in Part I is at the Troll King 's lair . As half the floor of the Guthrie opens upward like the hold of a cargo ship , white fumes belch forth as from an anteroom to hell . The trolls are quite droll . They are dressed in inky black frock coats and robes , their heads are chalk-white and they sport Miss Piggy snouts . The Troll King ( Frederick Neumann ) immediately recognizes Peer as a closet troll and lays down the primal law of trolldom , which is the leitmotiv of the entire play . As rendered in Rolf Fjelde 's lyrical English versification , it goes : <P> Among men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to yourself be <P> true ! " <P> While here , under our mountain <P> roof , <P> We say : " Troll , to yourself be - <P> enough ! "
