Mr. Sizer , a former dean of Harvard ' s Graduate School of Education and headmaster of Phillips Academy in Andover , Mass. , is now heading a major study of the high schools. // No serious change for the better will take place unless the structure of the schools is revamped , he warns in the June issue of Kappan , an education monthly. // A veteran principal of an urban high school recently responded to a speech by Mr. Sizer . " Let me tell you about my school , " the principal said . " They sent me two kids this morning who read at the fourth-grade level . I ' ve got to help them . We have 50 Cambodians who can ' t speak a word of English . My people have to help them . However , my staff is shrinking faster than my student body . I have almost no math or science teachers left who really know their subjects . The Mayor makes promises to us but always reneges . No one seems to care any more - parents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ideas are very nice , but they don ' t help me very much . I wish they did. " // The episode shows the gap between reformers and frustrated practitioners under fire in the front lines . Understanding that gap is crucial at a time when , as at present , the schools are analyzed and criticized , when educational commissions and politicians decry low standards and demand tougher ones . The deficiencies are real , and often serious . Critics , says Mr. Sizer , have been hammering away at them for decades. // Then why have there been so few dramatic changes ? And what is to insure that a new round of reforms will fare better ? // Mr. Sizer blames the schools ' basic structure , built in the late 19th century and hardly changed since . He understands the frustrations of that high school principal ; but he also knows that those frustrations stem from the fact that the embattled administrator is urged to make his school better without first making any basic changes . And that is an impossible task , despite all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ought to be treated as individuals , are herded into high schools with more than a thousand others , often 2 , 000 or more in big cities . There , they " cover " a succession of topics each day , without any apparent pattern or cohesion. // To work at all , such schools must control their courses and their traffic tightly . Under such conditions , says Mr. Sizer , significant changes in procedure are vetoed on practical grounds ; it disturbs too many things. // Yet the existing system is seriously flawed . Students are " delivered a service , " instead of being expected to educate themselves . Reformers may call for " four years of English for all students , " but who knows what four years of English entails ? // " The torrent of facts poured over students is overwelming , " Mr. Sizer observes , " and the only way teachers can keep up the flow is to lecture - and to feed students knowledge rather than expect them to forage on their own. " // Change costs money ; leaving routines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan , he adds , is applauded when he announces " an initiative " for science and mathematics intended to affect almost 50 million children , even though the expenditure " would barely buy two F-18 jets. " // Convinced that all the currently discussed reforms will fail unless fundamental changes are made , Mr. Sizer suggests some concrete action : // High schools must set themselves shorter , simpler , better defined goals , and get rid of others . For example , driver education may have to give way to English . Chemistry may have to be dropped so that biology and physics can be taught better. // Students entering high school with deficiencies in reading , writing and figuring would have to concentrate exclusively on those subjects until they mastered them. // Skills of reasoning , imagining , analyzing and synthesizing must be made the core of high school work ; but they can only be learned through confrontation and dialogue . This calls for different formats of teaching and fewer students per teacher. // The central goal of schooling ought to be for students to teach themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frenetic quality " of many high schools cuts the day into snippets of time . It calls for large blocks of time and less standardized instruction. // Such changes , Mr. Sizer admits , are " a bureaucratic nightmare " because they mean loosening the structure and paying attention to what students learn , or could learn , outside school. // If the schools are to respond properly to the different ways students learn , teachers must have control over schedules and programs - another bureaucratic nightmare. // Good teachers , he adds , value their autonomy . If it is taken away from them , they do mediocre work , or get out of teaching altogether . The administrative argument is that , because teachers are weak , they must be tightly controlled ; but when they are tightly controlled , strong people quit. // Under current standardization , every teacher , once licensed , is considered equal to every other teacher , an interchangeable part in a machine . This simplifies administration , but stands in the way of educational change and reform. // Mr. Sizer says , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naught if the politicians persuade the public that all that is needed is to tighten the screws a little . The success of today ' s reform movement depends on a rebuilding of the system to make it serve the needs of adolescents , to harness the capacities of good teachers and to respond to the demands of the 1980 ' s. //
