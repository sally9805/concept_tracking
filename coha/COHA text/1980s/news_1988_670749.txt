In the first half of this year , CD ' s in all categories of music outsold LP ' s for the first time , according to the Record Industry Association of America . The current Schwann record catalogue lists more than 20 , 000 CD titles of all kinds , and retailers around the country are clearing out their LP bins to accommodate the explosion of CD ' s. // But there are some in the record industry who fear that CD ' s have proliferated too quickly : that after five years of a CD drought , when consumers had few titles to choose from , the market is becoming flooded . What makes the record industry particularly nervous is that according to the Electronics Industry Association , only 15 to 20 percent of American households have CD players , and after five years of steady growth , player sales seem to have hit a plateau. // // Smaller Selections // Record companies say the vigor with which they have been issuing both new titles and back catalogue on CD should attract those consumers who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of CD ' s - $9 to the retailer , $15 to the consumer for a full-price recording - the quick expansion of the catalogue has led many retailers to be more selective in their ordering . As a result , even the largest chains are no longer able to offer consumers the kind of full-line service they offered at the height of the LP era . And even selective ordering has not kept slower-selling CD ' s from cluttering the bins. // A " CD glut , " as many industry executives openly call it , has already hit the classical-music market , where current recordings of standard-repertory works are now forced to compete for consumers ' attention with dozens of earlier versions , including legendary performances reissued on budget-priced CD ' s. // In pop , which accounts for the great majority of sales , the problem for the industry is not the repetition of a limited number of works but the fact that , as pop companies come closer to exhausting the back catalogues of their superstars , they are starting to issue disks on CD that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pop , there is still consumer resistance to CD prices , despite the decline from their introductory high , which was as much as $30 , to around $15 for a top-line recording - about $6 more than an LP cost before CD ' s came along . And although record labels are resisting the move , many industry executives feel that further reductions in price will be necessary soon if the format is to make greater inroads in the market . <> <> Factories in Competition // One reason cited for the oversupply of CD ' s is a change in the supply-and-demand equation over the last 18 months . On the supply side , the number of CD manufacturing plants has grown from only 2 in 1983 to more than 50 . Competition among the plants for business from record labels has brought down the cost of a raw CD ( unpackaged and not accounting for recording costs and royalties ) to less than $1 from about $3 in 1984 . Most labels are expanding their CD catalogues by a few dozen titles a month . But as the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to pile up. // Signs of a glut are particularly apparent in classical music , which accounts for only 4 percent of the American record market , according to the Record Industry Association of America . But an East Coast regional manager for the Tower Records national retail chain - which has long prided itself on carrying full lines in all genres - says that 25 percent of the chain ' s sales are of classical music . And industry observers point out that CD sales trends have emerged in classics a year or two before other kinds of music. // " What often happens in any industry , " said Joseph F. Dash , vice president and general manager of CBS Masterworks , " is that when you have an undercapacity , people overreact without thinking about the big picture . So we all began issuing on CD some of the wonderful performances we had in our back catalogues . And suddenly , what was a dearth has become an overabundance. " // Alison Ames , vice president in charge of Deutsche Grammophon ' s American operations , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when labels that had been slow to enter the CD market came streaming in. // " There was a time when we and the other Polygram labels , London and Philips , each had catalogues of 300 to 400 CD ' s and Angel had 20 , " Ms. Ames said . ' " Then , in a single month , Angel issued 60 disks . To me , that was the beginning of the CD glut . It meant that the classical dealer had a choice of putting all his eggs in one basket that month or spreading his budget around more thinly . " <> <> The Business Came ' Unglued ' // Brown Meggs , Angel ' s president , acknowledged that his company had straggled into the CD world , but he does not feel that Angel ' s quick catch-up was a bad thing. // " All we ' re doing is making the blades to fit the razors , " he said . " Before 1984 , our normal business was making 90 to 100 new recordings a year . But then someone unglued the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So what do we do ? We are catering to a smaller consumer base . But to make up for that , we have to offer the catalogue in the new format . So above and beyond our 90 new recordings a year , we have transferred to CD as much of the back catalogue as we could. " // Angel ' s CD catalogue includes about 1 , 600 titles , and according to Mr. Meggs , virtually the entire list of Angel recordings will have been transferred to CD by the end of 1990 . CBS and RCA have been nearly as prolific ; and the three Polygram labels have also increased their output significantly over the last year. // " The record companies are throwing a tremendous number of things at us , at all price points , " said Paul Tai , classical manager of Tower ' s Greenwich Village store . " We used to try to keep at least one copy of everything in stock . Now we can ' t do that . We are only ordering what we think we can sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copies of each title . " <> <> Lobbying for Favorites // Indeed , the move to CD has posed difficult marketing decisions for the record companies . Early on , many critics expressed the fear that the format change would drive many legendary performances out of print , and consumers began to lobby for CD reissues of their favorite performers ' work . In response , the companies dug into their vaults , not only transferring favorite LP ' s to CD but reviving recordings that had not been available for many years. // In doing so , they have re-created a situation they considered unhealthy in 1979 , when the LP business suffered a slump that was attributed , in part , to the fact that there were too many recordings of too few works in the repertory . The current Schwann , for example , lists more than 40 CD versions of the Beethoven Fifth Symphony , a dozen of Puccini ' s " Boheme " and 48 of Vivaldi ' s " Four Seasons. " // Ms. Ames says the problem has been enlarged by the recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - sometimes as low as $5 a disk . In many cases , these CD ' s offer repertory warhorses played by unknown performers , sometimes under pseudonyms that sound close to the names of real performers . Two names cited by Ms. Ames on recent disks are Martha Bergerich and Ivo Rogelic , which sound remarkably similar to Martha Argerich and Ivo Pogorelich , both popular pianists who record for DG. // The major labels have responded to these budget companies by issuing similarly priced budget lines of their own . RCA ' s Victrola , CBS ' s Odyssey , Angel ' s Laser , DG ' s Musikfest and MCA ' s Royal Blue are examples , all priced between $5 and $7 and offering popular classics by artists like Leopold Stokowski , Karl Richter , Pierre Monteux , Neville Marriner , Daniel Barenboim and other names familiar to even neophyte classics buyers . Each label also has one or more mid-price CD line , featuring old but highly regarded recordings at about $10 . <> <> Increase in Recording Costs // Record-industry executives cite several reasons for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note that recording costs have continued to increase , nearly doubling in the last decade . Recording sessions for an opera now run about $300 , 000 , and a symphonic recording by a major orchestra and a star conductor can cost more than $100 , 000 . Budgets for rock recordings vary but can fall into the same range. // In addition , artist royalties now account for a greater share of a CD ' s retail cost than when the disks were introduced . When manufacturing costs were high , performers were persuaded to accept royalties based on LP rather than CD list prices to help establish the format . Now that costs have dropped , artists have insisted on a royalty commensurate with disk prices . Royalties vary typically from 8 to 12 percent ( $1. 20 to $1. 80 on a $15 CD ) . // Finally , packaging - the " jewel box " container with accompanying notes about the music , and oversize wrap to discourage shoplifting - can account for $1. 50 on a single CD and more for a multi-disk recording. // So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to downward pressure on top-line CD prices . In fact , many of the older recordings that now make up the mid-price and budget lines were first issued at full price . But company executives are disinclined to predict further reductions in top-line prices. // " We have no intention of lowering the prices in the forseeable future , " Mr. Meggs of Angel said . " In classics , you ' re fighting for margin at all times , and as far as I can see , most of our costs are going up . That said , if someone who represents meaningful competition drops the top-line prices , we would have to be competitive . " <> <> Changes in Pop Market , Too // The pop market may be immune to certain of the classical market ' s problems , since recordings of jazz musicians and rock bands tend to be regarded as one-of-a-kind creations rather than new interpretations of familiar repertory . Still , the pop market , too , has changed as more older titles have been transferred to CD. // " I don ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , editor of International CD Exchange ( ICE ) , a newsletter that keeps tabs primarily on rock CD releases . " It strikes me that some of the pop labels have patterned their releases slowly and judiciously to avoid a glut . On the other hand , it ' s no longer the seller ' s market it used to be. " // Classics executives , however , are searching for solutions for the glut that has already hit . " There are no facile answers , " Mr. Dash of CBS said . " We have to think very carefully about what we release now. " // Mr. Meggs of Angel sees catalogue deletions and possibly cut-rate remaindering on the horizon . " I would like to see our catalogue steady out at around 1 , 000 titles , " he said . " Which means that anything selling fewer than 500 or 750 copies a year will be deleted , with the exception of certain historically important recordings. " // Michael Emmerson , president of BMG Classics , which owns RCA , said : " I don ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that we have not done enough to persuade the other 80 to 85 percent of the American public that the CD is accessible , reasonably priced and here to stay.
