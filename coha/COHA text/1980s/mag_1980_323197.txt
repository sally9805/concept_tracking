I wish gasoline rationing and the ban on private driving remain in force forever . " Retorted his passenger , an elderly man pressing an attach case against his breast : " It is a good thing God does not grant taxi drivers ' wishes . " The shortage of fuel has made life uncomfortable for Tehran 's 7 million people , but in the fervor of the war between " Islam and paganism , " there are few complaints .

The reason is not so much the fear of air strikes as the noisy urging of young people and children who act as self-appointed civil defense wardens .
