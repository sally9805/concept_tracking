Two recent buildings on very different campuses make this point splendidly . Neither looks like anything around it , yet both take their cues , in very nonliteral ways , from the existing buildings and landscapes around them . And both succeed in making a place - in joining with what is around them to create a whole that is larger than any single building. // The first is the Lewis Thomas Laboratory at Princeton University , a molecular biology facility designed by Payette Associates and Venturi , Rauch &; Scott Brown . This is not a building that would seem , at first glance , to have anything to do with the ideas of harmonious place-making . Its facade has elaborate sections of ornamental brick in three decorative patterns , one of which is a vast checkerboard , and the roofline is broken by six smokestacks and five greenhouses . The $29 million structure is not only striking but almost strident , and it is not surprising that it was at first considered by some to be more of an unwelcome intruder than a benign presence on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the facade ( the firm of Payette Associates , while officially the main architect for the project , concentrated its efforts on the internal design of the laboratories ) , and Mr. Venturi demonstrated with a vengeance here the same tendency toward mannered , even idiosyncratic , design gestures that marks his other work , including his earlier effort at Princeton , Gordon Wu Hall . But the remarkable thing about all of Mr. Venturi ' s best buildings - and this is one of them - is that what upon first startled sighting may appear willfully eccentric , even arbitrary , turns out upon more extended acquaintance to be altogether reasonable , even sensible. // This is a quirky building , but it is an immensely friendly one . Mr. Venturi ' s quest was twofold : to make the long , long structure required by the laboratory layouts visually convincing in its own right , and then to tie this structure to the larger context of Princeton ' s campus . Unlike many so-called high-design architects , Mr. Venturi did not challenge the proposed laboratory designs , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he accepted them as a given , and defined his mission as that of wrapping a convincing structure around them without compromising their workability . The result is a building that gives every indication of functioning more smoothly than most laboratories that bear the signatures of celebrated architects. // Princeton ' s campus is an odd mix of buildings that are genteel , almost dull , and buildings that are energetic , and in some cases even bombastic . It is these that are the Lewis Thomas Laboratory ' s real peers , and its real inspirations . The building owes some debt to the great brick factories of 19th-century New England , some more to the sumptuous Elizabethan manor houses and a bit to the 19th-century Gothic Revival. // But it looks like nothing from any of these periods . The facade consists of alternating bands of cast stone and ornamental brick . The bands of stone contain windows that are divided into small panes , one of many details that loosely tie the building to Princeton ' s older architecture ; the brick is arranged in patterns that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stencilwork more than brickwork . Yet they create a rich sense of texture that , like the window mullions , allows this building to communicate with Princeton ' s eclectic , though largely Gothic , existing architecture. // The only detail that could even remotely be called literal is the bit of Gothic tracery over the main entrance . But even this , in true Venturi fashion , is slightly perverse - it is only a portion of a Gothic entry portico , sliced off to give its soft lines a crisp modern abbreviation . There is just enough here to enhance the main entrance but not so much as to let anyone think Mr. Venturi was interested in imitating this building ' s Gothic neighbors. // The building - which was named , in a pleasing break from the custom of naming college buildings for their donors , to honor the distinguished scientist and author who is also a Princeton graduate - sits at one edge of the campus , facing a large playing field . Its main facade , however , is turned toward the rest of the campus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walk , a main pedestrian route across the campus . Its placement thus helps create a new space , not quite a quadrangle but a strong outdoor space nonetheless. // The enclosure of outdoor space - in effect the making of an outdoor room - is one of the accomplishments of another significant new campus building , the Franklin W. Olin Humanities Building at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson , N.Y. The architect here was Cathy Simon of the San Francisco firm of Simon Martin-Vegue Winkelstein Moris , in association with Wank Adams Slavin of New York . This building is smaller than the Lewis Thomas Laboratory , as Bard is smaller than Princeton , but it represents an even more conspicuous commitment to the ability of a work of architecture to serve as a civilizing gesture on a campus. // Bard is an uneven campus architecturally - it lacks Princeton ' s sumptuous inventory of older buildings , but it has some splendid surprises , as well as an expansive , even lush , setting on the Hudson River . Like Princeton it is still reeling from the effects of a plague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and also like Princeton it has embarked on a major effort to right the architectural wrongs of the last generation . ( There are two projects under construction by James Stewart Polshek , for example . ) Bard ' s finest buildings are a row of stone dormitories built in the 19th century , which set an order on this exquisite campus that most later architects ignored. // Ms. Simon ' s first priority was clearly to restore some sense of coherence to this campus - which , like Mr. Venturi , she did not by imitating her building ' s neighbors literally but by setting up the parameters for a more subtle level of architectural conversation . The Olin Building does not look like anything else at Bard , but it seems at home at Bard , created for its particular site on this campus and nowhere else. // The building faces an eclectic group of older structures that did not , until now , seem placed in more than random arrangement . Together with a newly completed addition to a nearby science building that was also designed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small segment of the campus and turns it into a nearly private quadrangle . A broad , paved terrace with wide steps gives this space a hint of the feeling of a tiny public square , not so much to make it feel urban , but just enough to make it a comfortable counterpoint to the wide open landscape that fills most of the campus. // The building itself is squat , its main section containing classrooms in an ample shed of brick with a small central gable . Behind this structure is another large shedlike wing containing a gracious 380-seat concert hall , windowed to bring a view of the landscape indoors during afternoon concerts . The concert-hall wing is set at a roughly 60-degree angle to the main wing ; a handsome glass lobby forms a connector between the two sections . Within the lobby comes one of the building ' s most joyful architectural moments , a circular interior colonnade that makes the transition from one building ' s axis to the other as neatly as the rounded form of John Nash ' s All Souls Langham Place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Place in London. // The Olin Building is houselike in its imagery , although hardly to the point of being cute about it ; what is particularly pleasing about this structure is that it is still very much an institutional building . It might best be described as gracefully mixing the image of a large brick house with allusions to the old New England mills and factories that are now justifiably so much respected by architects. // As at the Lewis Thomas Laboratory , patterned brick provides the ornamentation on the facade , along with cast stone and some tile in a checkerboard arrangement . The building is somewhat plain , though it is hardly simple , but it does have a splendidly un-self-conscious quality to it . Cathy Simon ' s Olin Building exemplifies the gentle and knowing allusions to ordinary architecture that Robert Venturi celebrates in his writings , rather than the rich , almost Baroque play on ordinary architecture of Mr. Venturi ' s actual buildings. //
