More than $1. 1 billion in cash would change hands if the deals go through , most of it probably lent by banks . These acquisition proposals , though not of the Gargantuan size of some mergers of the past two years , draw attention to the longrunning debate about mergers , particularly the issue of whether their financing absorbs money that would be better used elsewhere . The late-summer corporate brawl involving the Bendix Corporation and three other companies raised this question , and the new Congress will doubtless consider whether some kind of restriction should be placed on deals to combine very large companies . <> <> The Background // Americans have a long tradition of worrying about concentrations of power . Since the modern corporation is often very large , some people worry that combinations of such companies put increasing amounts of power into fewer hands. // The Sherman and Clayton antitrust acts are intended to discourage anticompetitive behavior , such as price-fixing and the sharing of markets . But in recent years there have been many attempts , most of them unsuccessful , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , would have put a dollar limit on conglomerate marriages of companies in unrelated businesses . Another would have put a temporary ban on mergers between the largest oil companies and those in the second rank. // There are now informal proposals in Congress to restrict mergers by denying them the huge amounts of financing they often need . The Bendix-Martin Marietta fight , said Representative Henry S. Reuss , the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the Joint Economic Committee , tied up $5. 6 billion in bank credit throughout September . This was a time of severe recession when many businesses failed because they could not pay high interest rates. // Some critics say that legislative restrictions on takeover financing are now needed . Informal restrictions have occasionally been imposed by the Federal Reserve , most recently in 1980 . <> <> For Restrictions // Those in favor of credit restrictions tend to regard mergers as generally unproductive . In this view , big corporate acquisitions result mainly in a reshuffling of the ownership of corporate wealth without creating usable goods or services. // According to this argument , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management attention they cause make mergers a generally wasteful exercise . Society , it is said , is the loser when billions of dollars of credit - some $46 billion at one time last year - are earmarked for takeovers , thereby denying funds to other borrowers that may be more " worthy . " Moreover , the scramble for credit by large corporations , which have the muscle to push lesser borrowers aside , raises the price of credit for everyone , according to the argument. // " Millions of ordinary Americans , " Representative Reuss said in referring to the Bendix tussle with the Martin Marietta Corporation , " are not amused by this spectacular misuse of their savings by the corporate world and the banking system. " // The Federal Reserve has lent some support to the idea that the freewheeling use of merger credit has its dangers . The Fed ' s concerns relate mainly to its role as a supervisor of banks ' soundness. // Paul A. Volcker , chairman of the Fed , told a House subcommittee last year , " I am concerned whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been pulled together has , in fact , permitted adequate analysis either of the individual credit or the implications for the bank ' s commitment , liquidity and capital positions , including its ability to service other established lines of business. " // There is , he added , " the possibility of a kind of infectious competitive fervor about takeovers distorting banking judgments or the credit markets . " <> <> Against Restrictions // The latest spurt of mergers is not unhealthy , say those who oppose curbs . They say that such combinations often result in economies of scale that raise productivity and that the existence of takeover threats spurs managers to perform well . Opponents of curbs also suggest that mergers are caused more by low stock market values than by any other factor. // Moreover , they argue , there has been no significant increase in the concentration of American industry . According to the Federal Trade Commission , the top 200 nonfinancial companies saw their share of nonfinancial assets fall to 38. 3 percent in 1977 from 40 percent in 1958 . More recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top 200 companies rose slightly , to 59. 9 percent in 1980 from 56. 7 percent in 1974. // The idea that earmarking billions of dollars for mergers raises interest rates throughout the economy has never been proved , opponents of restrictions say . In addition , the earmarking of the money appears to have little effect on the amount of credit available to others , they say. // For one thing , far more credit is lined up for takeover fights than is actually used - while there may be several bidders , there is only one winner . And even when a credit line is drawn down to pay for an acquisition , the recipients tend promptly to reinvest their proceeds. // " Even when the money is borrowed , it comes back into the system , " said Philip M. Hampton , executive vice president of the Bankers Trust Company. <> <> $500 Billion Credit Pool // Opponents also say that the tens of billions of dollars that may be lined up for takeovers pale beside the more than $500 billion in the nation ' s credit pool. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest rates , this would not necessarily justify controls , said Walter Vandaele , an economist at the Federal Trade Commission . Mergers frequently have positive effects on society by promoting competition , he added. // Mr. Hampton said that banks made their own credit analyses , minimizing the chance of wild corporate bidding . A merger idea " has to be good enough , " at least for the sponsor , in order to remain creditworthy , he added. // Controlling mergers with legislative restrictions , he contended , " is nonsense . " <> <> The Outlook // Although there is what one Senate aide called " a lot of political capital " to be made in opposing mergers , it is not clear how the legislative battles will develop in the new Congress . Last year , most of the antimerger effort was devoted to changing tax laws that encourage corporations to merge. // Critics failed , however , to win further restrictions on tax carryovers that sometimes inspire one company to acquire another merely for the seller ' s tax credit. // Bills restricting credit can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to draft . One problem is the possible circumvention of any new law by raising money overseas. // Other problems in drafting a bill are to avoid giving a possible advantage to cash-rich companies and to avoid reducing the possibility of a target company finding a friendly company to rescue it from an unwanted suitor . One possible approach would be to eliminate the deductibility of interest borrowed for mergers. // One Congressional staff member said , " It ' s difficult to draft a bill on credit that doesn ' t end up doing things you don ' t want to do. " //
