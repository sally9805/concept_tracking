txt ERHAPS ONE OF the most frustrating medical problems  --  for both patient and physician ? is symptomatic gut distress , which commonly shows up as constantly churning intestines , stomach pain , heartburn , nausea , weakness , bloating , and gas . These are the pains of the so-called " irritable gut syndrome . " Doctors struggle to recognize this common syndrome , Gut reactions because it is displayed in so many different ways by so many different kinds of patients , most of whom are otherwise healthy . Some suffer , it seems , because their aching guts serve an important function : They allow the gut reactor to control other people . A young woman frightened by sex can get horrible cramps when she crawls into bed with her lover ? and he will quickly leave her alone . A wife who does n't want to cook dinner , but who feels ? obligated to do so , can double over with pain ? and hubby will cook instead . A man who claims to want a new lob but secretly fears the responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moaning and clutching his belly ? and his wife wo n't nag . All of these people can visit their doctor , ask endless questions , list pleas and complaints ? and get the doctor 's constant reassurance , Their guts are a one-way ticket to instant attention . Gut reactors usually do n't want things to work this // way . The pain is real , and the reasons for it are Subconscious . If you 're a gut reactor , your lifestyle probably needs careful examination and some gradual but forceful changes . ANY CHANGE BEGINS with the belief that the change is both necessary and worthwhile . One of the doctor 's biggest jobs is convincing people that the " little things " recommended will make them feel better . The advice to take a brisk walk every day is a good example . Sophisticated patients , who come to the office bloated and cramping and who 've spent enormous amounts of time and money on exams and lab tests , will frown with disbelief when the " prescription " turns out to be a haU-hour walk around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse to change their lives in any way , large or small , because they need their symptoms . Dr. Lawrence S. Miller , medical director for the Rehabilitation Institute of Glendale Adventist Medical Center in Glendale , Cal. , says that some people cling to chronic pain for subtle psychological reasons such as avoiding unpleasant jobs , getting attention from a spouse , or as a reason for neglecting their children . " It should be clearly understood that these people are not malingerers , " Dr. Miller says . " It is easy for a physician to spot a malingerer or a hysteric . The need to keep one 's pain is far deeper than that . It may be a wife who has an atrocious marriage . She is ignored and belittled by her husband . When : she has pain , he is sorry . He takes her out to dinner . She is important because she suffers . " DR . MILLER 'S POINT is that , while the suffering of bodily pain may not be coming from any organic cause , it is real : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sliced with a knife . In gut reactors , the pain may take a variety of forms . Nobody knows why one patient is crippled with cramps while another might suffer nausea and belching . It 's also a mystery why some patients manifest just gastrointestinal symptoms , while others get hit with chest pain or headaches , too . No matter how many symptoms are present , and no matter how bad they are , most people determined to get rid of them usually accomplish that goal . Dr. Miller says people with a good " outlook on life " refuse to give in to pain . Your " conditioning to life , " or programming as Some psychologists call it , starts early . The strains Women whom assertive , competent , successful , and sure of themselves are easier to treat .. . These women usually are n't afraid to give up their symptoms , and they 're eager to try almost anything to find relief . and pleasures of life are felt while still in the womb . The regular heartbeat , gentle movements , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different intrauterine environment compared to the palpitations , churning , and possible infusions of drugs  --  and cigaret smoke imposed upon a fetus by a mother who is nervous or unhappy . By the time you 're 4 or 5 , the conditioning or pro ? gramming probably hits its peak , and you 've de . veloped some rudimentary coping mechanisms . For the lucky ones who 've had pleasant programming , . that coping mechanism could be a grin and a cheery , " I 'll keep trying . " For ethers , it could be gut reactions . .1 ALTHOUGH IT SEnmo there are no specific studies that pinpoint irritable bowel syndrome as mostly a " woman 's disease , " researchers do mention that more women than men commonly display gut reaction symptoms . On Nov. 4 , 1971 , the Lancet reported that " unexplained abdominal pain is the 10th commonest cause of hospital admission in men and 8th commonest in women . " And in " The Irritable Colon Syndrome , " ? published in 1962 in the Quarterly Journal of Medicine , two doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmly , " and pointed out that most of these people happen to be female . These women are not poor , worried about cancer , or losers in the game of life , said the doctors . They 're in good physical shape , but they 're just nervous , almost all of the time . SO , according to the doctors , the women use their stomach distress " to represent a particular mode of responses to a difficult life situation . " Passive women often are gut reactors . They may be cheery little housewives on the outside and boiling infernos of anger inside . They may be married to hard-driving , domineering men who derive great security from keeping a tight lid on " the little woman , " although the men rarely are aware of their destructive attitudes . They say they love their ' wives and want to " protect " them ? except the wife is hungry for a chance to escape the suffocation of such blind protection . WOMEN WHO ARE assertive , competent , successful , and sure of themselves are easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit  --  a holdover from a repressive childhood they 've now overcome ? or a coping mechanism representing their last symbolic submission to a male-dominated society . These women usually are n't afraid to give up their symptoms , and they 're eager to try almost anything to find relief . One patient discovered her vomiting went away after she told her husband she did n't want to cook ? dinner after working all day . He balked at sharing kitchen duty , but she insisted , and they finally compromised by hiring a cook . Another patient , an attractive executive in her late 40s , found relief from intense gas pains after meals when she sweetly but firmly told her boss that she , not he , would decide when she took her lunch break . A young accountant erased her own crippling gut pain by making a much bigger change in lifestyle . She quit her dead-end job and renovated a room in her home as a private office , so she could begin a career as a consultant . WHETHER IT MEANS changing your eating habits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to other people , some change in lifestyle usually is necessary to cope with gut reactions . Running , jogging , or brisk walking helps almost every gut reactor willing to incorporate this simple physical activity into his lifestyle . The rhythmic movement may provide the perfect " medicine " to calm writhing guts by providing relaxation and by moving along any trapped gas present in the colon and abdomen . If running is n't your idea of a great lifestyle , try swimming or simple gymnastics . For some , tennis or golf provide the answer . Generally , the best prescription is what works for you , but it 's important that gut-reacting patients try a sport that does n't require being competitive , making appointments with people , or engaging in elaborate preparations .
