Marketing experts are convinced that advertising plays a key role . Others would tend to agree . But just how large a role and which advertising techniques are most effective are topics of vigorous debate . This controversy is one reason advertising methods tend to vary widely and recur in cycles over the years . An estimated $62 billion was spent on advertising in 1982 , but the search for what motivates consumers to buy has not ended. // ' ' There are lots of reasons ' ' that people buy products - reasons ' ' that they ' ll never admit , ' ' says Allen Smith , associate professor of marketing at Florida Atlantic University . ' ' They ' ll say they bought a Mercedes because of its quality or gas mileage - they may not want to tell you they bought it because it has snob appeal . . . . The bottom line is that advertising is a very hard subject to study . Everyone has his own opinion of what works best. ' ' // Some university marketing experts say the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coupons , and contests . They point to the recent flurry of games and prizes offered by fast-food chains and to car-rental-agency giveaways of everything from TV sets to luggage. // ' ' Advertising campaigns have changed dramatically over the last year or so - there are lots more of the ' buy one and get a coupon toward something ' variety geared to the current economy , ' ' says Roger Blackwell , professor of consumer behavior at Ohio State University . In his view it ' s all part of a response to ' ' frontier consumerism , ' ' in which both spouses in most families work and the only remaining way to make income stretch is to shop for more value for each dollar spent. // ' ' As people grow more careful , ' ' Dr. Blackwell explains , ' ' they look for advertising that is more explicit in pinpointing value and communicating useful information about a product. ' ' // Coauthor of a leading college textbook in the advertising field , Dr. Blackwell says he also sees a move away from the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a company or product , such as ' ' Fly the Friendly Skies of United ' ' or ads extolling the environmental care taken by certain oil firms . Instead , he says , many ads now try to get the consumer to change his behavior and develop brand loyalty by offering a reward . One current airline ad campaign , which is aimed at the frequent flyer and offers free trips as a bonus for miles logged , is a classic case of what he calls the ' ' B-mod ' ' ( behavior modification ) approach. // Most marketing experts say they think the current emphasis on comparative ads , which tout the merits of one brand over others , will continue . Officially encouraged by the Federal Trade Commission since 1979 , the technique is practiced by promoters of everything from hamburgers to peanut butter . Some campaigns , such as the Pepsi-Cola challenge to compare the Pepsi taste to other colas , have been notably successful . But many experts still question the general effectiveness of such ads. // ' ' Some parents don ' t like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of naming the good things about yours , ' ' Professor Smith says . ' ' If what you say is true , and people find it so , this kind of advertising can be effective . But sometimes people don ' t pay close attention and think the product being disparaged is the one doing the advertising. ' ' // Indeed , this worry that the consumer might remember only the competition is one reason some advertisers soft-pedal the naming of rivals . A current ad-coupon for Van de Kamp ' s fish sticks , for instance , carries the headline : ' ' It ' ll Make You Forget Mrs. What ' s Her Name. ' ' // ' ' Any ad that sends people away without remembering their product is a bad ad , ' ' says J. Steven Kelly , associate professor of marketing at De Paul University. // One hard sell , the 15-year-old ad campaign that many consumers and ad experts label boring and obnoxious - but a definite winner when it comes to getting consumers to remember the product - is Wisk detergent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collar. ' ' // It ' s one of the most disliked commercials , Professor Kelly says . ' ' But if you ask the man on the street what detergent eliminates that problem , four out of five people will probably say , ' Wisk , ' ' ' he adds. // While consumers may enjoy humorous ads as entertainment , there is very limited evidence that they are more prone to buy the product advertised. // ' ' The negative thing about humor is that it takes away from the time you mention your product and that consumers don ' t necessarily remember it , ' ' says Joanne Cantor , associate professor of communications at the University of Wisconsin , who has run several tests on the short-run effectiveness of such ads . Among her findings : Children who watched a promotion in which an adult lectured on the dangers of eating sweets were more likely to spurn dessert at lunch than youngsters who saw a lively ad in which a group of oranges praised themselves as snack alternatives to sweets. // ' ' There is little evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it distracts and may actually be detrimental , ' ' Dr. Cantor says. // Questions in slogans or jingles - such as McDonald ' s line a few years ago on what ingredients go into a ' ' Big Mac ' ' - are generally considered effective ways to get consumers involved in ads and help them remember the product. // ' ' You don ' t put in question form something that ' s easy to refute , ' ' Dr. Cantor says . ' ' But , generally , if the consumer doesn ' t have a better answer , a question is more acceptable than a bold statement of fact. ' ' // But even as the search goes on for more effective ad techniques , experts say future ads are sure to remain varied. // ' ' With so much money being spent on advertising , it becomes a real challenge to come up with something different , ' ' says Robert Hartley , professor of marketing at Cleveland State University . ' ' But everyone is groping to come up with a unique selling proposition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its effectiveness. ' ' // //
