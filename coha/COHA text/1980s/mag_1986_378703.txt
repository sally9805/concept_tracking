Hungary <P> In the fashionable neighborhood of Zugliget , overlooking downtown Budapest , the drabness of Communism seems a world away . Sleek , modern villas nestle beside Italianate mansions along the quiet , winding streets . Well-coiffed women in fur coats promenade upon the snow-dusted sidewalks . The district that housed many of Hungary 's pre war magnates now shelters a different breed of plutocrat : the entrepreneurs who have prospered under the country 's unique brand of " goulash Communism . " <P> Hungary 's 11 million people have long been the envy of the East bloc for their cautious success at replacing at least part of a Soviet-style centralized economy with profit-oriented agriculture cooperatives and carefully administered oases of free enterprise . Along Budapest 's glittering Vaci Street , the shelves of well-kept stores and boutiques are stuffed with Western videocassette recorders , luxury clothing and high-tech kitchen appliances . The nearby food markets display long racks of sausage and ham , mounds of fresh winter vegetables and ubiquitous garlands of crimson paprikas . Says a member of Hungary 's new economic gentry , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich ? By Western standards , no . But here , we are quite comfortable . " <P> That statement by no means applies to all Hungarians , and the comfort that exists has been hard won . Hungary 's first experiments with marketplace reforms were crushed during the country 's 1956 uprising against Soviet domination . Paradoxically , the man who presided over the suppression of that revolt , Janos Kadar , now 73 and still the country 's leader , made today 's relative prosperity possible . <P> Even as he threw rebellious students and workers into prison , Kadar ordered economists to diagram an overhaul for the country . " It was clear that centralized planning had failed , " says Ivan T. Berend , president of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences . " If we were to provide a comfortable standard of living , market principles had to be introduced . " Unstated by Hungarian authorities was the premise that in return for that comfort the population would live passively under Communist rule . <P> Unveiled in 1968 , the New Economic Mechanism gradually gave factory managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among other things , they could make more decisions about production quotas without the approval of state authorities . Small-scale entrepreneurs were al lowed to open everything from private bakeries to boutiques and restaurants . In the countryside , profit-oriented cooperatives sprang up alongside Soviet-style collective farms . Vendors were allowed to set the prices of vegetables , clothing and many consumer goods freely . <P> One of the most effective reforms was the official sanctioning of the " second economy . " Typically working eight hours a day in a state factory or farming cooperative , Hungarians were encouraged to hold down additional jobs as taxi drivers , seamstresses , restaurant workers or shop clerks . They were also allowed to use their regular workplaces for private after-hours labor in a number of designated occupations . The reforms were roundly successful : between 1968 and 1978 real purchasing power rose more than 50%.
