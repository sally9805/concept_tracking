Civilian protests confront the Soviets with a fierce new challenge <P> We have won a greats victory . We have shown the Russians what the Afghan people think of them . " So said a belligerent Kabul merchant , exulting over the mass anti-Soviet protests that rocked the Afghan capital last week , The unrest was reported to have spread to six provinces , from Kandahar in the south to Baghlan in the north , and the Soviets were facing the most serious challenge to their two-month-old occupation of Afghanistan , which has brought them worldwide condemnation . <P> The floundering Kabul government of Party Boss Babrak Karmal was ordered to clamp martial law and a dusk-to-dawn curfew on the capital . Soviet troop reinforcements were rushed into the city to put down growing disturbances . Nonetheless , firefights that caused at least 50 casualties broke out in several parts of the city . As rebel leaders threatened to mount a full-scale attack on Kabul in March , intelligence officials in Washington could scarcely contain their glee at the Soviets ' discomfiture . Said one defense analyst : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> The general strike and accompanying demonstrations represented the first time that Afghan civilians had joined the armed rebels in standing up to the Soviets . From Moscow 's viewpoint , it was thus an ominous warning that the resistance could develop into a general uprising throughout the country . Moreover , the civilian protests accompanied other intelligence reports that Karmal 's dissension-racked puppet regime was on the verge of collapse . Overall , the Soviets appeared to be up against a dismal strategic reality : to suppress both the insurgency and civil disobedience , they might have to remain in the country far longer than they had perhaps intended , and they could be forced to bring in as many as 50,000 more troops to retain control of the cities and highways . <P> The Kremlin 's concern over the fierce new challenge inside Afghanistan was apparent in a policy pronouncement made last week by Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev . Accusing Washington of " hysterics " and of " circulating the lie about the war of the Russians against the Afghan people , " Brezhnev reiterated Moscow 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terms of a Soviet-Afghan treaty . Said the Soviet President : " The U.S. loudly demands the withdrawal of Soviet troops but in fact is doing everything to put off this possibility ; it is continuing to build up its interference in the affairs of Afghanistan . " In a direct attack on Jimmy Carter , he declared : " The anti-Soviet hysteria was needed for somebody riding the crest of this wave to win the presidential election in the autumn . " But then , in what may have been a subtle deviation from the Kremlin 's hitherto intransigent line , Brezhnev made the point that the Soviets would withdraw their troops when outside interference is " permanently terminated .
