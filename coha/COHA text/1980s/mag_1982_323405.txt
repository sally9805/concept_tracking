At 70 , Sam Sneadputts sidesaddle , but what the heck <P> Byron Nelson , Ben Hogan and Samuel Jackson Snead all will hit 70 this year , a pretty good score when you consider the course . Almost 40 years since he was able to win eleven golf tournaments in a row , Nelson is in Texas being venerable and staying available to Tom Watson whenever the kid needs a lesson . Hogan is in Texas being difficult and hanging up on Gary Player when the South African calls for advice . ( " Mr. Player , are you affiliated with a club manufacturer ? " " Dunlop . " " Call Dunlop . " Click . ) Snead last week was in Ohio being Snead and so was playing in a golf tournament . <P> Not a seniors event , like the Legends he won last month in cahoots with young Don January , 52 . Sam is not done with the juniors yet . Last Thursday , on his 70th birthday , he teed it up in the first round of the Memorial Tournament at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built by Jack Nicklaus that will one day be for Nicklaus what Augusta National is for Bobby Jones : something close to a monument . <P> Sam gives no thought to such things . " They memorialize folks up there at Muirfield , " he said before leaving Hot Springs , Va. , his boyhood home . ( Since his boyhood is not over , he still lives there . ) " But you have to be retired or dead to be memorialized . Since it does n't look like I 'm going to do either one , they decided to throw me a birthday party instead . " So a 70-year-old athlete was competing last week at the highest level of his sport . <P> He shot 61 at age 24 , 59 at age 47 and 67 at age 68-in tournaments . " What the heck , I 've won 165 tournaments or so , " he said , including a record 84 on the American tour . Starting in 1936 , he has been winning for " six decades or so . " How in Sam Hill has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having golf lessons helped some . " As Nelson says with envy but without resentment , " Hogan and I worked hard to perfect our swings . Sam was born with his . " Even the best golfers ' swipes show the strain of their various checkpoints , but Snead still makes his velvet swing seem the most natural thing for a man to do . Over the decades , only Sam has noticed much change . " Some rusty spots , " he said . " I 'm not as strong as I was when I was 60 . " <P> On the green , it is another story . An old story , a horror story . Golfers all lose their game , and usually their dignity , on the green . Nicklaus , who is in the throes of it at 42 , won for the first time in two years last month with the steadying aid of his 19-year-old son Steve , who caddied and read his putts . Hogan got to the chilling point where he could scarcely draw the putter blade back . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putt , " said Snead with a shiver . " Once you get the ' yips , ' you never lose them . " For almost ten years now Sam has been putting " sidesaddle . " Literally and figuratively , he is the only great player who ever faced up to the yips . As unseemly as it is to be putting like a gondolier , Snead said , " it was either do that or quit . " And , to Sam , anything beat quitting . " Most players are too proud to try it . What the heck , I look at it like fishing . It 's not how you get the fish on the line . "
