" So much violence , " murmurs Eliot Ness ( Kevin Costner ) as he cleans out his desk at the end of The Untouchables . <P> A truer , sadder sigh has never escaped from a movie sound track . He has , after prodigies of bloodshed and the loss of precious friends and values , fulfilled the classic destiny of a movie hero . Garbed in a mysterious , often near comical purity , he has arrived in a profoundly corrupted community and , by imposing his eerie conscientiousness on it , awakened its conscience . Now the city is at peace , in part because Ness has taken upon himself some of its wickedness . Or , as he puts it , " I have become what I beheld , and I am content that I have done right . " <P> The Untouchables is not a realistic recreation of Chicago during Prohibition . Nor is it a typical effort from Brian De Palma , who has often put his awesome technique and his admirable sense of film history to trashy ( Dressed to Kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it goes to that place that all films aspiring to greatness must attain : the country of myth , where all the figures must be larger and more vivid than life . <P> We might therefore join De Palma and Screenwriter David Mamet in a prayer that their epic work  --  a masterpiece of idiomatic American moviemaking as well as a plangent commentary on its traditions  --  will be spared from the literalists , complaining both that the gore is too real and that the characters are not real enough . Protect them as well from the wrath of the traditionalists , who resist the intrusion of originality on their passion for the endless restatement of stale generic conventions . Deliver them instead to the audience that will be galvanized , as the filmmakers were , by the chance to reimagine all the cliches of crime fiction . <P> Begin with Al Capone , from whom all factual and fictional descendants have learned some of the elements of style . But skip all that gangster-as-tragic- hero stuff . In Robert De Niro 's grandly scaled performance he is demonically expansive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his secret life , the life his romanticizing fans did not want to hear about , illustrates a lecture on teamwork by taking a Ruthian clout at a traitorous underling 's skull with a baseball bat . What he evokes , finally , is pure horror ( and maybe some black humor ) but  --  and the film is rigorous on this point  --  no sympathy . <P> Ness is even more radically redefined . Mamet says he sees him as a lone town tamer of Western legend . De Palma has evoked the name of John Ford to suggest the classic qualities he was aiming for . And Costner has something of the grave beauty Gary Cooper used to bring to these roles . <P> But he is something more than the Western hero transplanted to the city 's wilderness . He is not a detached solitary ; he is a family man , pleased when his wife tucks a love note into his brown-bag lunch , careful to include both an Eskimo and a butterfly kiss in his little daughter 's good-night ritual . Nor is he a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he proudly asserts his learning through the punctilious formalities of his manner and diction . Indeed , he is a man whose survival ( and killer ) instincts are in dire need of on-the-job training and support .
