Man wins office sex suit <P> Sexual harassment has become in the past few years a routine basis for lawsuits brought by women against male bosses . But a male employee suing a female supervisor on the same grounds is like the proverbial man biting the proverbial dog . David Huebschen , 33 , an employee of the Wisconsin Department of Health and Social Services , is apparently the first male to win such a suit . Last week a federal jury in Madison said that he is due $196,500 in damages , probably the largest amount ever awarded an individual in a sexual harassment case . The sum is to be paid by the state on behalf of Huebschen 's former superior , Jacquelyn Rader , 37 , and Rader 's boss , Bernard Stumbras . <P> The jury of five women and one man believed Huebschen 's contention that Rader demoted him from his job as a disability-insurance supervisor because he refused her sexual advances . Stumbras , an administrator of the state agency , was held liable for not remedying Huebschen 's harassment complaints . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not always feel harassed by Rader 's overtures . After an office party in September 1979 , the couple met in a motel room but did not actually consummate their tryst , Huebschen says , because he was " too tense . " In November , he testified , he told Rader that " the sexual stuff has to stop . " Rader soon sent him packing to his old , lower-paying job as a claims adjudicator . <P> Rader , who like Huebschen is married , denied any affair . Rather , she claimed , it was he who pestered her-unsuccessfully-for dates . Rader said she demoted Huebschen in 1979 because he was an inept supervisor . Yet just three months earlier she had praised his work in a written critique , and a month before that she had recommended him for a pay raise . <P> The record amount awarded Huebschen was a surprise . " Sexual harassment is a pervasive problem for women , not for men , yet you do n't see this kind of award to women , " noted Isabelle Pinzler , director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Project . Said Detroit Attorney Allyn Ravitz : " Male or female , every big verdict has got to help . "
