The tall , burly Mr. Finkle is not a typical construction chief with typical workers . Most of his crew wear button-down business clothes Monday through Friday and work as architects , accountants , industrial designers , or social workers . But every other Saturday they don green sweat shirts that say , ' ' We ' re Nuts about Huts ' ' and meet in an old warehouse to build plywood shelters. // // Finkle , an architect who just earned his master ' s degree , is the president of the Mad Housers , an energetic band of 15 young professionals determined to do something about Atlanta ' s growing homeless problem . The group was organized two years ago. // ' ' The huts are just a Band-Aid solution , but at least they get people off the streets and out of the cold , ' ' Finkle says as he quickly drives a nail into a two-by-four . ' ' We usually build two huts a month , but I ' d like to start building three. ' ' // The Mad Housers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the city . They work in donated warehouse space and use scrap materials and lumber they ' ve salvaged from local construction sites . As soon as they complete the walls , floor , and roof , they load the panels into a ' 73 pickup and drive off to the selected site , where they put the hut together. // What these weekend carpenters do is illegal , since the huts are built on government or private property and do not comply with city codes . But in the past two years , the group has provided shelter for between 100 and 200 people. // The Mad Housers have also brought the plight of the homeless to public attention . Dubbed the unsung heroes of the homeless , they have received national media coverage , been recognized by the Georgia chapter of the American Institute of Architects ( AIA ) and Architectural Record , a national journal , and won numerous awards . They received the Giraffe Award , a plaque given to groups and individuals who stick their necks out for community service and the betterment of mankind. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Housing Conference in Washington , D.C. , and four other members built and displayed a hut recently in New York at an exhibit titled ' ' If You Lived Here . ' ' They also constructed two huts in the city. // In Atlanta , some city officials reacted to the Housers ' activities as an infraction of the law . Atlanta ' s Department of Parks , Recreation , and Cultural Affairs tore down two huts built near a residential area , and the Georgia Department of Transportation razed one built on access land. // Most of the huts , which are scattered throughout the downtown area , are left undisturbed by the city . The underground construction crew seems to have an informal alliance with local officials and the city police . Architect Mike Connors , a founder and former president of the group , says , ' ' City officials have been very supportive and open-minded . They could have passed stronger vagrancy laws , but they ' ve let the huts stand. ' ' // Last winter Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young honored the Mad Housers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build a pair of two-person bungalows with complete facilities . But the group must first get its tax-exempt status before it can claim the grant and begin building. // Amy Phillips , an anthropologist and secretary of the group , says inquiries about building huts and low-cost housing have come from England and West Germany , as well as from people across the country . ' ' In the past year and a half , we ' ve sent out close to 75 starter kits , ' ' she says . Kits include hut designs , lists of materials , and advice to groups on selecting a site and getting tenants. // The inspiration for forming Mad Housers came from Finkle and Mike Connors , who , as graduate students at Georgia Tech , got the idea while writing their master ' s theses on homeless shelters in Atlanta . After looking at some of the makeshift cardboard huts people built to avoid going to city shelters , Mr. Connors and Finkle felt they could help build better , more durable huts . Along with three other architectural students , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim and Anita Beatty , the directors of Atlanta ' s Task Force for the Homeless , to learn where the homeless were located . Mrs. Beatty says , ' ' They ' re a gutsy group - they ' re demonstrating the irony of third-world kind of housing in a first-world country . They ' re also making a strong political statement for the homeless. ' ' // Initially , the homeless were skeptical . ' ' Clients wanted to know how much the huts cost , what kind of forms they had to fill out , and if we were going to preach to them , ' ' Ms. Phillips recalls . Now that the Mad Housers have become a familiar group around the city , many of the homeless seek them out and are even on a waiting list. // Finkle explains , ' ' We try to get the homeless to help build their own huts , so they have a sense of ownership and learn how to make repairs . They also help pick a site - it ' s important to put them where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are built within an easy walk of downtown Atlanta . Many are along railroad tracks , in abandoned lots , and under bridges or viaducts - in areas where the homeless already gather and live . Cabell Heyward , an industrial designer with the Mad Housers , says , ' ' We try to build ( the huts ) close to a water supply , soup kitchen , bus line , labor pool , and canning route . ' ' ( Many homeless people collect cans and scrap metal to sell. ) // These building Samaritans hope to attract more members and donations so they can buy a better truck and construct some permanent , low-cost housing . ' ' We ' ll keep on building huts as long as the group stays together and there ' s a need , ' ' Finkle says . ' ' We ' ve barely made a dent in the homeless population of Atlanta.
