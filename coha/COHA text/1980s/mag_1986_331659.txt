It had been a relaxing evening for Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme , 59 , and his wife Lisbeth . They had just been to an evening showing of the new Swedish film The Brothers Mozart in a downtown Stockholm cinema and had decided to take a walk afterward . For the slight , hawk-nosed Swedish politician with a ready smile , it had always been a matter of pride that he sometimes permitted himself to wander freely about the capital , unencumbered by the phalanx of bodyguards that protect other European heads of government . As the Palmes walked along Sveavagen , Stockholm 's well-lighted main thoroughfare , a dark- haired man wearing a blue ski jacket walked briskly up to the couple , pulled out a handgun and fired two shots at close range . A bullet struck the Prime Minister in the back , and he crumpled to the snow-covered pavement . <P> A taxi driver heard the shots and immediately called for help . When police arrived , Mrs. Palme , herself grazed across the back by a bullet , said , " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Within minutes Palme was rushed to Sabbatsberg Hospital , where doctors struggled in vain to keep him alive . At six minutes past midnight Saturday morning he was declared dead . Palme thus became the first Swedish leader to be killed since King Gustav III was shot to death at a masked ball at Stockholm 's opera house in 1792 . <P> Police sealed off all exits to the city for hours after the shooting , called a national alert , and stepped up patrols at border crossings . It was the largest manhunt in Sweden 's history , but as the week began , no arrests had been made . Police speculated that the murder might have been committed by any number of disaffected groups , from Croatian nationalists to West German terrorist factions . <P> Palme 's assassination sent a wave of revulsion across Sweden , which for decades has advertised itself as a model society largely devoid of the social strains that create such wrenching political violence . Stunned Swedes tossed red roses on the murder site ; some placed candles on the sidewalk . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block . On a wall a banner was hung , reading : WHY MURDER A TRUE DEMOCRAT ? " It is an almost unbelievable shock , " said Ulf Adelsohn , leader of the conservative opposition in the country 's one-house parliament . " Sweden will never be the same after this . " Following an all-night meeting of key Swedish leaders , Acting Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson , 51 , who was promptly designated Palme 's successor as party chief , announced that the government would be dissolved , but would act on an interim basis until parliament meets this week to choose a new Prime Minister . Said Carlsson : " This was a blow not just to Olof Palme and his family but to Sweden as an open society . " <P> Condolences poured into Stockholm from all over the world , with many noting the irony that a man so devoted to peace and nonviolence could be assaulted in anger . President Ronald Reagan expressed his " great shock " and " sorrow in the face of this senseless act of violence . " Said British Labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy . He was a very good man , a very peace-loving man . "
