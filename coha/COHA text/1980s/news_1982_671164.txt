Those were troubled times , marked by growing unrest , by the 1956 uprising and by the installation of Janos Kadar as head of the Hungarian Communist Party. // So were the years that followed . Mr. Kadar began evolving his program of economic decentralization , and Mr. Andropov , by then back in Moscow , was largely responsible for allowing him to develop the program in his position overseeing the Central Committee ' s dealings with Eastern Europe . <> <> Hungarians Willing to Talk // Mr. Andropov ' s tenure in Hungary gives his background a special quality . No other top Soviet leader since Lenin has ever lived outside the Soviet Union . And it offers the West a chance to learn something about the man . The Hungarians know him well , and they are willing to talk ; people in the Soviet Union have usually found it prudent to say nothing , or to hew to a prearranged line , in discussing the country ' s leaders. // The recollections of some Hungarians interviewed in Budapest afford little if any insight into Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Soviet intelligence and internal-security agency , and even less into the way he fought his way to the top of the Politburo . They also relate mainly to events of long ago . So the picture is limited , and perhaps somewhat distorted , but it is probably better focused than those that can be readily obtained in the Soviet Union. // On Nov. 1 , 1956 , with the streets of Budapest blackened from battle , with Soviet forces pouring into the country despite their agreed withdrawal from the capital , Imre Nagy , the leader of the Government , who sought to bring about change , found himself under pressure from all sides . He called Mr. Andropov to his office and denounced the troop movements. // The Soviet Ambassador said he knew nothing of this but promised to find out . Some time later , after what Hungarians close to the situation have described as a heated telephone conversation , he gave his word that the influx of Soviet troops would be halted. // But it was not . By 2 P.M. the Nagy Cabinet had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pact , and by 5 P.M. Mr. Nagy was reading a declaration of neutrality to Mr. Andropov . <> <> ' Hungary ' s Best Friends ' // The next day , the new commander of the national guard , Gen. Bela Kiraly , was sent to the Soviet Embassy to look into the Ambassador ' s complaints that Hungarians were sacking it . Mr. Kir@aly , who now teaches at Brooklyn College , remembers that Mr. Andropov assured him , " Believe me , general , the Soviet people are Hungary ' s best friends . " He offered immediate negotiations to discuss a new withdrawal of the Soviet troops. // " Here was this man Andropov who clearly understood what was going on , " Mr. Kiraly said bitterly , " yet he pretended until the last moment to me and to the Prime Minister and to others that everything was business as usual . Even pirates , before they attack another ship , hoist a black flag . He was absolutely calculating. " // According to several Hungarian sources , Mr. Andropov had already begun to make his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , Mr. Kadar , First Secretary of the party , and Ferenc Munnich , the Minister of the Interior in the Nagy Government , stopped at the Soviet Embassy and talked for some time , apparently to the Ambassador . Miklos Vasarhelyi , Mr. Nagy ' s press aide , who later spent four years in prison , said , " It was Andropov who talked to him first , and it was Andropov who persuaded Kadar to go over to the Soviet viewpoint . " <> <> Negotiations With the Russians // From the embassy the two Hungarians were taken to the Tokol air base , outside Budapest , to Uzhgorod across the border in the Carpathian Ukraine and on to Moscow . In a speech in 1957 , Mr. Kadar said he began negotiations with " the Soviet comrades " on Nov. 2 ; " by Nov. 3 , we were all set , and on Nov. 4 , the offensive began " - the closing of the Soviet pincers around Budapest. // It is widely believed in Budapest that Mr. Andropov was one of the key figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Nagy ' s replacement . Khrushchev himself preferred Mr. Munnich , who had fought in the Russian Revolution and in the Red Army in World War II. // On the night of Nov. 2-3 , however , Khrushchev was meeting President Tito of Yugoslavia at the latter ' s island retreat of Brijoni in the Adriatic Sea . According to the diary of a Yugoslav diplomat who was present , Tito argued strongly that Mr. Kadar would be more likely to attract a genuine popular following in Hungary , not least because he had served time in jail under the Stalinist Government of Matyas Rakosi. // " Andropov knew the opinion of Hungarian party leaders better than anyone else , and he knew the mood of the people , " a close associate of Mr. Kadar said . " When Tito opted for Kadar , Andropov was in position to support him . " <> <> From ' Comrade ' to ' Mr. ' // Janos Berecz , the editor of Nepszabadsag , the Hungarian party ' s daily newspaper , has written extensively about the events of 1956 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a reputation for plain speaking , and he has pointed views about the meaning of the new Soviet leader ' s experiences in Hungary. // Mr. Berecz said in an interview in his Budapest office , with a picture of Lenin , but none of Mr. Kadar , looking down from the wall : " When the Government changed , he stopped being Comrade Andropov and started being Mr. Andropov . He learned from that experience . He knows perfectly well that the crisis here , and similar crises elsewhere in Eastern Europe , have nothing to do with Western imperialists arriving here and manufacturing difficulties . He knows that crises arise from within and have to be solved from within . That counts for a lot. " // According to Mr. Berecz , a former head of the foreign department of the Hungarian Central Committee , Mr. Andropov continued to monitor Hungarian affairs closely , even after he gave up direct responsibility for relations with Hungary . He met often , the editor said , with Mr. Kadar in Moscow , and supported his policies in the Politburo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were relieved that Mr. Andropov had come to power , though no one said so directly . <> <> ' Thinks Before He Talks ' // " We ran the full text of Andropov ' s Nov. 22 speech , " he said . " In a way , it sounded like our speeches , and we think he is interested in reform . But of course one nation can not copy another - he can ' t very well go to the Soviet public and say , ' Let ' s be like Hungary. ' " // The thing about Mr. Andropov that most impresses Hungarians who know him is the quality of his mind . Mr. Berecz described him as a man " who thinks before he talks . " Andras Hegedus , the Stalinist Prime Minister of Hungary in 1955 and 1956 , speaks of " an open mind , intelligent and not merely clever. " // " We were Stalinist functionaries together , " recalled Mr. Hegedus , who was trained as a sociologist . " We traveled to villages and farms and factories , talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes went to Moscow on the same airplane. // " He was different from most Soviet diplomats I have known . Most of them think they know everything after they have read the papers , and they stay in Budapest . Not Andropov . He had a real passion to learn and to know - to understand - this country , and he was even willing to learn some Hungarian so that he could probe more deeply. // " Another point . His attitudes were clearly different from those of the Brezhnev generation . Like me , he grew up in postrevolutionary times . We shared a less doctrinaire approach to social problems . Once a much older Hungarian colleague and I were arguing in front of Andropov about the Marxist thesis that capitalism must end in absolute poverty . I insisted that the statistics didn ' t support the theory , and it was clear to me that Andropov agreed with what I said . " <> <> An Unusual Promotion // A Western diplomat who served in Budapest in the 1950 ' s said he thought that Mr. Andropov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the key to his success in the months and years after the uprising. // " When he came to Hungary , he was 40 years old , a junior functionary , not even a member of the Central Committee , " said the diplomat , who is now living in retirement . " Then he became Ambassador , which was in itself unusual , because few diplomats are ever promoted without changing posts . Then the country fell apart , which should have marked him for oblivion . Proc@onsuls who fail are usually marked for oblivion , like your Mr. Sullivan after the Iranian revolt. // " Andropov kept on moving up . His big contribution - the thing that made his masters in Moscow respect him - must have been tough , accurate appraisals of the situation in Budapest . The key lesson of that episode is not the arrival of the Soviet tanks , which was obviously decided upon at a much higher level than the embassy , but what came after the tanks. " // Miklos Molnar , a leading Budapest journalist at the time , who now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that view . During a long talk in his book-littered study in Geneva recently , Mr. Molnar said , " Those of us who were following events intensively heard very little of him until almost the end of the uprising , because the big decisions were in the hands of much larger Soviet personalities - especially Mikoyan and Suslov , who came to Budapest often that autumn . " Anastas I. Mikoyan later became Soviet President ; Mikhail A. Suslov was the party ideologist . <> <> A View of Andropov ' s Function // " I don ' t see a direct or demonstrable role for Andropov in deciding what to do about the uprising , " Mr. Molnar added . " He was not functioning as Moscow ' s gauleiter . He was the Kremlin ' s main source of information , but the policy was that of the Politburo. " // According to David Irving ' s book " Uprising ! " published last year , Mr. Andropov had his doubts about the way the policy unfolded . Mr. Irving quoted Mr. Andropov as having told a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hungarians themselves , let alone the Western powers , for the uprising , is not right. " // A minority view is that of Georg Heltai , then the Deputy Foreign Minister , now a history professor at the College of Charleston in South Carolina . While conceding that " he was just a transmitter " who had to " clear with Moscow " certain decisions , Mr. Heltai told the BBC recently : " I ' m sure that he had an absolutely free hand to deal with the revolutionaries , so the reign of terror in Hungary was the reign of terror of Yuri Andropov . It ' s bound to his name forever. " // The former Minister , who admired Mr. Andropov ' s coolness and his intelligence , said the Ambassador " was the ultimate power who decided who and how many people should be executed . " <> <> ' Rectify the Situation ' // Ivan Boldizsar , the editor of The New Hungarian Quarterly , used to meet Mr. Andropov at receptions and sometimes chatted with him in English . He put the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , " proved conclusively to Suslov and through Suslov to Khrushchev that the Soviet management of Hungary had been misguided and that Kadar could best rectify the situation. " // " In the end , " Mr. Boldizsar said , " Andropov was a hard-liner . After all , the Soviets came in and crushed the rebellion . But they didn ' t do it until Nov. 4 , and the outcome was much better than it might have been otherwise. " // Mr. Vasarhelyi , the former Nagy press aide , says it is pointless to describe Mr. Andropov as a hard-liner or a soft-liner . " I have no illusions about the man , " he said . " He spent 15 years as the head of the K.G.B. He has had a long and successful career in the party . He is a tough man , but he is a realist . One can speak to him , especially on the subject of Central and Eastern Europe . Unfortunately for us , Eastern Europe is the one area where the Russian ruling class , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Cambodia , on arms , even Afghanistan , yes , but we are their forecourt . One can only hope that Andropov ' s investment in Kadar over all these many years will give us a bit of protection.
