txt WHEN THE BEATI.Es came on stage at the International Ampitheatre Sept. 5 , 1964 , a girl near me leaned over the rail of her box and started shouting - John . John ! JOHN . JOHN ! ! John ? JOHN ! John . " Her face alternately reflected at env and ecstasy . This girl kept caning .. Jonn minutes without missing a beat . I 'd been chatting with her before the show , and she was a nice , clean , normal looking girl of 15 or so . Nearby a girl in red leaned out of the balcony so that the rail hit at about her hip bones . She spent the entire concert with her torso at a 90-degree angle over the rail , screaming " RINGO ! " There were about 10.000 teen-agers , mostly girls , and 3,000 or so parents at this first Chicago Beatles concert . The din was so overwhelming that it was impossible to hear a note the Beatles sang or played . The young audience knew all the words anyway . Girls sat with tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outflung , loosing piercing shrieks . Girls buried their heads in one another 's shoulders . ONE WOULD LOOK up at John or Paul and both would scream and shake . They fell to the floor and writhed . In other Beatles concerts scores of youngsters had been carried out on stretchers . Chicago was prepared , Forgotten Children 's Fund Donations may be sent to 435 N. Michigan Av. , Chicago , III . 60611 tnougn. a nunureu VA tau .. were walking the aisles with small bottles of ammonia and wads of cotton . . When a young lady would seem to pass out or become trancelike or fall on the floor , a fireman would give her a hefty sniff of ammonia . This was done hundreds of times . Without exception it alleviated the need for stretchers , until after the concert when a few bodies were found under the seats . All revived , albeit with some hysteria , in the first aid room . It was difficult for parents to understand the Beatles ' hold on young people . My newspaper ran a headline : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers to write answers . The replies did n't settle a thing . The kids adored them , the parents wondered . Most of the stories written by adults about the Beatles and their effect on teens were so , so arch or condescending or deadeningly academic . FIVE OF MY COLUMNS from Sept. 2 to Sept. 8 were about the Beatles and their followers and their concert . I distinguished myself and infuriated three young ladies in our household by writing that the Beatles would n't ever be remembered in 25 years . It took me about two years to understand and ap preciate their music . I talked with a young lady named Judy Stambler , then 17 , of Highland Park , who may remember her words if she reads this . " I think It 's definitely music , " said Judy in trying to explain the Beatles . " It has a good beat , you can dance to it , and you can follow some of their songs . " But I think their appeal is other than music . ? " In this crappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's one good , happy thing left . " The Beatles are something that rebels against everything . They rebel against authority . " I WAS ASKED by the promoters to introduce the Beatles at the Amphitheatre . I accepted because it was a unique opportunity to report on a major social event , and I anticipated ? correctly ? that I would get no more attention than a pillar at the side of the stage . The managers warned me not to say the word " Beatles " during the preliminaries . It would set off hysteria . " We do n't want them to get any more excited than they are , " the managers said . After the second act the place became relatively quiet , and I got cute . " I have been instructed not to mention a certain seven-letter word or everybody will start screaming , " I said . Everybody started screaming . The Beatles came on the scene shortly after a bullet ended President Kennedy 's life . In our city room Tuesday a reporter suggested that another bullet had ended an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her generation to say , " In this crappy world , they are something that 's just fun : : We 've lost one more good , happy thing .
