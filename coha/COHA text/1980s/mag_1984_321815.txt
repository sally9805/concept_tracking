Ronald Reagan 's greatest asset is his charm-something that flows naturally from him but that he can wield as effectively as a sharp rapier . I watched him charm a dinner table in June this year , a mixed group that included the coach of football 's Dallas Cowboys and a Hollywood magnate as well as the guest of honor , Madame Jayewardene , wife of the President of Sri Lanka . She was very shy and ill at ease , but President Reagan , though tired from a day 's travel , quickly sensed her anxiety and took it upon himself to entertain her . He talked of the handicapped whom he had just been visiting ; she discussed Sri Lanka 's problems with drugs . When she spoke of the perfumed forests of her island country , he invited her to crush in her fingers a Martha Washington geranium on the table and smell the perfume it left behind . He went on , fascinating us all , with stories of his Hollywood days . He spoke of how he did not like the heaving and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way Ernst Lubitsch had handled the subject , by hint and suggestion-the hand of a bride dropping her nightgown outside the bridal-chamber door , then the door closing , leaving the rest to imagination . This conversation seemed pure entertainment . But Ceylon was important : it holds the harbor of Trincomalee that we want to use in case of war . Madame Jayewardene left , swathed in a friendship that might be essential to policy . <P> I watched him again in the closing days of the campaign at Temple Hillel in North Woodmere , N.Y.-a lovely synagogue in suburban Long Island . This time , Reagan was subdued , ministerial . Wearing a yarmulke , he promised that if ever Israel were forced to walk out of the United Nations , America would walk out too . He charmed and soothed the congregation . The cameras picked him up ; they picked him up again at lunch , eating apricot kugel ( a pudding ) at the rabbi 's home immediately thereafter . The television " bites " that evening warmed the hearts of thousands of uncertain Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential if he was to carry New York . <P> Reagan can be decisive : I remember speaking with Caspar Weinberger , Secretary of Defense , just after the February decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Lebanon . Essentially there had been a conflict between State and Defense-Defense had wanted to get out of Lebanon even before the October massacre , while State kept insisting our presence was necessary . While preparing to watch Lauren Bacall perform in Woman of the Year Sunday afternoon , Feb. 5 , Weinberger had been summoned to an immediate meeting of the National Security Council at the White House . The Republican politicians had long wanted out of Lebanon ( " The forget period , " said one of the President 's men , " is about six weeks in American life . We have to be out before June " ) . Only Shultz had resisted a pullout ( " A very stubborn man , " said Weinberger ) . The emergency conference lasted two hours . Reagan decided that Sunday evening : pull out , now , as fast as possible . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the decision had been made . <P>
