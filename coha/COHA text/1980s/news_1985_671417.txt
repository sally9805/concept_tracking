The prosecutor also explained the law on self-defense , and the panel decided not to indict him on more serious charges in connection with the shooting .

He was headed south to visit friends , the police report said. // Mr. Goetz did not want to discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Officer Foote ' s report , however , he took a seat near the four young men , two of whom were seated on either side of the door he entered .

" // At this point , Officer Foote said , Mr. Goetz stopped discussing the incident and said he wanted to give some background about why the incident took place . He said that he had been assaulted twice before , according to the report , and that during one assault , his knee had been injured . He said that " two other times he had been threatened seriously , " the report added , " and that is why he was , at the time of the incident , carrying a firearm .

" // " Mr. Goetz stated he stood up and in doing so he noted that one of the men put his hand in his pocket in a move that indicated he was carrying a weapon , " the report went on. // " Mr. Goetz went on to state that this in itself was not a threat , he did not feel threatened by this move . Mr. Goetz stated that he knew what he was going to do , and he already had in his mind the spirit of fire , that he was going to fire when he did in fact shoot the men. // " He said he spoke to the man who asked for the $5 , asking him , what do you want . The man asked Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , Mr. Goetz stated he pulled out the revolver that he had in his waistband belt. " // C. T. Domian , a second New Hampshire officer who interviewed Mr. Goetz , said Mr. Goetz " indicated he drew a pattern of fire prior to the shooting taking place , indicating that he was going to shoot from left to right in the quickest and most effective manner as possible. " // " He indicated speed was everything , " Officer Domian said . " He further stated that he shot each of the individuals once and then went back to the last individual and shot that individual again , thinking he had missed him the first time , because there wasn ' t any evidence of blood on the person. " // Officer Domian said Mr. Goetz had told him the four had shown no " outward signs of being armed or a danger to him , other than one of the individuals appeared to be holding something under his jacket. " // " He went on to say that he felt just the body language of the individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talked to Conductor // After checking the condition of two women passengers , who had apparently fainted , Mr. Goetz had a conversation with the conductor , but decided against turning over the gun to him , Officer Foote said. // When the train came to a stop , Mr. Goetz fled , running south on the tracks to the Chambers Street station . Once there , he jumped onto the platform and ran up the steps toward the street . At the street , " he slowed to a walk , and took a cab to his apartment. " // Soon afterward he rented a car and headed for Bennington , Vt. , where he burned the light blue jacket he wore that day . Officer Foote said Mr. Goetz informed him he took the gun apart , " bent the frame up and buried it in the snow in the woods , somewhere north of Bennington . " In the interview , Mr. Goetz took issue with Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward , who last week said he thought Mr. Goetz had not acted in self-defense because two of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he believed Mr. Goetz should have been indicted for the shootings. // Mr. Goetz said Mr. Ward had a " right to his opinion , but he has not been exposed to all the facts . " He said , " The Commissioner wasn ' t there. " // Repeatedly , Mr. Goetz said that all the facts had not been disclosed in his case and he said , as Joseph Kellner , one of his lawyers , has said in the past , that the four surrounded him and that there was no time to get away. // In recent days , Mr. Goetz has decided to discuss his views on gun laws . He said yesterday that more citizens should be entitled to licenses for guns and should be trained to use them . He said he was surprised that various public officials , including Mayor Koch , had rejected the idea. // " I know Mr. Koch is concerned with what is best for New York , " Mr. Goetz said . " I feel he is frightened or concerned that more licensed handguns will result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a deterrence , " he said . " People are automatically assuming that if you carry it , you will use it. " // <> <> ' I ' m Not a Gun Nut ' // Mr. Goetz said that he had drawn but not fired his gun before and that before the subway incident , he had not fired a gun in five years . " I ' m not a gun nut , " he added. // Mr. Goetz was denied a gun permit by the Police Department and purchased the gun he used in the shooting , as well as two others he kept in his apartment , out of state . He said yesterday that arming the public would prevent violent crime. // " That is an unpopular concept , I gather " he said . " But I need public support . In New York City , this idea will probably damage people ' s respect for me . " He added that other states allowed people to have gun permits. // He said people should be " trained and tested for marksmanship " before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the gun out of the holster quickly , " he said , adding that if they " fumble and drop " the weapon , it could be used against them. // Looking back over the worldwide publicity the case has brought , Mr. Goetz said he had been stunned by the reaction , and he blamed the police in New York for making it into a " media event. " // " I wish this never happened and I were just an innocuous gun-toting honky on the street , " he said. // //
