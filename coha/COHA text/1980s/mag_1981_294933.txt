WAYS OF ESCAPE by Graham Greene ; Simon &; Schuster ; 320 pages ; $12.95 <P> An award for the most diffident title of an autobiography hi the past decade should go to Author Graham Greene . A Sort of Life ( 1971 ) did not exactly cry out " buy me " when it hit the bookstores , though thousands of Greene fans snapped it up anyway . They were treated to an odd , beguiling performance . The author coolly portrayed his childhood and youth as a succession of blunders , chiefly his own : he tripped over his own psychoanalysis at age 16 , fiddled unsuccessfully with Russian roulette as a way out , failed at writing a play , botched nearly everything he touched . The self-deprecation seemed sincere but puzzling : How could the young man in this book have grown up to be a successful , world-famous writer ? How , for that matter , could he have survived at all ? <P> Ways of Escape takes Greene from his mid-20s to the present , while making him seem just as inept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given his spectacular career . So he dwells whenever possible on failure . He finds in two of his early novels " a badness beyond the power of criticism properly to evoke . " He studies himself as a beginning writer and concludes : " I am not sure that I detect much promise in his work . " He characterizes his low-echelon work with the British Secret Service during World War II as " futile . " Occasionally , he has to confront the specter of one of his triumphs . He does so suspiciously : " The Heart of the Matter was a success in the great vulgar sense of that term . There must have been something corrupt there , for the book appealed too often to weak elements in its readers . " <P> Constant poor-mouthing can either grow tedious or , worse , seem like trolling for compliments . Fortunately , that is not the case here . Greene 's guarded , skeptical attitude toward his material ( in this case , his own life ) is consistent with the one he has shown in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books . The smug , the self-satisfied , the overblown , even the merely happy are setting themselves up for ridicule and a long fall . Minimal expectations are a hedge against disappointment . In fact , Greene 's past has been dashing and colorful beyond the daydreams of most ; without the ironic filter of his personality , Ways of Escape might read like a schoolboy romance . <P> He decided early on to be " a spectator of history " and succeeded admirably . His itinerary is a check list of modern crises . He was in Mexico in 1938 , during a persecution of the Catholic Church , and in London during the blitz . He learned to love Viet Nam and opium during the last years of French occupation and spent 24 nervous hours at the doomed camp of Dien Bien Phu . Then it was on to Kenya for the Mau Mau uprising and later to a leper colony during the final days of the Belgian Congo . He sampled pornography in Batista 's Havana , just before Castro and his forces came down from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duvalier 's Haiti in 1963 and found himself under Egyptian gunfire in Israel in 1967 . It would be hard to think of a contemporary writer who has exposed himself to danger so thoroughly , in so many troubled spots .
