By 7:45 Saturday morning , 150 cars are lined up bumper to bumper , lights on - station wagons , Mustangs , Winnebagos from places like Indiana , North Dakota and Ohio . A couple from Florida in a rented car wait for the motorcade to begin . The husband fidgets nervously with his movie camera , anxious to get to the Trinity site , the 432 sq . mi. of desert where the world 's first atomic bomb was exploded on July 16 , 1945 , at precisely 5:29:45 a.m. , Mountain War Time . Once a year the site is opened to visitors . " We 've been looking forward to this for a long time , " the man says . " The whole atomic thing began during my lifetime , and this is kind of romantic . " <P> In the parking lot , members of the Alamogordo Chamber of Commerce busily hand out leaflets warning that radiation on the site is still above average levels . A booklet adds that it is only one-fifth as great as the radiation received from a chest X @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the ten-acre , fenced-in area around ground zero , lest radioactive materials be ingested . " What 's a little radiation ? " scoffs 14-year-old Lee Hutchinson , visiting Trinity for the second time . " It 's bad at Three Mile Island because that 's in the middle of civilization . But this is really in the middle of nothing . " <P> It certainly is . One hundred and fifty miles from the southern border of New Mexico and just over 100 miles from Alamogordo , the site lies between two jagged mountain ranges in a valley named by the conquistadors Jornada del Muerto ( Dead Man 's Walk ) . It is remote and entirely unpopulated , the perfect testing ground for the plutonium monster that the " longhairs " were concocting at Los Alamos in 1944 . That winter Physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer , the father of the atom bomb , was pressed to give the site a code name . The erudite scientist glanced down at some lines of John Donne 's poetry in a volume that he had been reading : " Batter my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said over the phone , " we 'll call it Trinity . " <P> The flash of what Winston Churchill called the " second coming in wrath " could be seen as far as 250 miles away . <P> The blast was heard 50 miles away . Its explosive power was as great as that of 20,000 tons of TNT . <P> This morning , in mock-funeral fashion , the motorcade of atomic-age pilgrims solemnly winds its way past whorls of dust and yucca bushes to reach the 6-ft . Cyclone chain-link fence that surrounds the blast area . Among the pilgrims , some 1,700 of them , are mothers and babies , parents and grandparents , families of three and four who scurry out of cars , Minoltas in hand , eager to record for posterity the " place where it all began . " What they see is nothing much . The original 400-yd. , 25-ft. - deep crater has long since been filled in to prevent further radiation . The " pearls of Trinity " - ceramic-like green glass , or Trinitite , formed from the sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried or stolen by souvenir hunters . A few relics remain , though , sparkling in the pale sun , and visitors still filch them , cramming the radioactive rocks into their pockets .
