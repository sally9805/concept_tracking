NEWPORT , R.I. - Hank Pfister stormed off the court and immediately began looking for a captive audience . He had a few things he wanted to get off his chest . " I knew there would be problems . With Brad ( Drewett ) , you ' ve got to expect them , " Pfister said . Pfister had just dispatched the Australian Drewett , 6-4 , 7-6 ( 7- 3 ) , in a Miller Hall of Fame quarterfinal match at the Newport Casino yesterday . He advanced to today ' s semifinals against Craig Wittus , who beat Anand Amritraj , 1-6 , 7-6 ( 7-5 ) , 7-6 ( 7-4 ) . Johan Kriek and Erik van Dillen will play in the other semifinal today . In doubles , Larry Stefanki and Scott McCain beat Mike Estep and Nick Saviano , 6-4 , 7-6 ( 7-3 ) . The Pfister-Drewett match would not have met the Lady Di seal of approval . The two can ' t stand each other , and their feud spilled over onto the court . " There were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half ago , we played a very close match that I lost , and we had a lot of problems in that . " He started belittling me , saying stuff to me on the court . I wanted this one very badly . I got very intense for this , not so much because it ' s a quarterfinal , but because it ' s him , " Pfister said . The catalyst for the second round of the Pfister-Drewett bout came with Pfister serving , down 30-40 with games tied at 3 in the first set . Pfister aced Drewett to survive a break point . But Drewett claimed it was a let ball . After complaining to the umpire , asking for a tournament referee and getting a warning for delaying , Drewett solicited Pfister ' s opinion on the call , according to Pfister . " That ' s what really made me mad . He did it to needle me . You just don ' t yell at a player on the court , " Pfister said . " After the match , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ' re a real sport when you win . No wonder you don ' t have any friends on the tour . ' Everybody has trouble with the guy . " Drewett ' s problems coincided with his " getting screwed . " Pfister went on to win the game , break Drewett ' s service and take the set , 6- 4 . " I shouldn ' t have let it screw me up . But it ' s just so hard to get screwed like that and just let it happen , " Drewett said . As for his requesting the tournament referee , he said , " I don ' t know why I did . It was just spur of the moment . I really had no recourse , but it was just so hard to accept . That was the first break point of the match . " I just said , C ' mon Hank ' kind of sarcastically . I didn ' t ask him what he thought . What really riled me was that he ( Pfister ) bluffed it . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you certainly don ' t run to the other side . He knew it was a let . He admitted it was , " Drewett said . The competitors were a lot more civil in the Wittus victory over Amritraj . Wittus , a 24-year-old who recently turned pro , came back to win two tiebreakers after dropping the first set , 6-1 . This is the farthest he has gotten in a major tournament . " I wasn ' t playing that badly in the first set , but Anand was just carving me up . He was taking the pace off the ball , " Wittus said . " But what I started doing was returning everything soft , taking all the pace off the ball . " The tournament ends tomorrow .
