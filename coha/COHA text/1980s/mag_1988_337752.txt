Twelve feet high and 120 ft. long , Richard Serra 's Tilted Arc stretches like a rampart across the plaza of a federal office building in New York City . It seems only fitting that , as the centerpiece in a drawn-out battle over artists ' rights , the steel wall sculpture even looks like a barricade . In % 1985 , after workers in the area complained that it inhibited use of the site , the U.S. General Services Administration , which had commissioned the $175,000 piece , recommended its removal . That galvanized the art world and provoked Serra to fight in federal court against any attempt to move it . He lost the first round , but , undaunted , he was there again last week to appeal . " The Government has to learn that art is not property , " he says . " You ca n't move it like paper clips . " <P> Governments may be starting to agree . Since 1979 a handful of states , including California and New York , have adopted laws that give artists a degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Now Congress is considering bills that would do likewise . Because one result might be to give film artists a say in whether their work is " colorized " or similarly fiddled with , Producer George Lucas and Director Steven Spielberg showed up last week at Senate hearings to speak in favor of such legislation . If unchecked , said Lucas , " current and future technologies will alter , mutilate and destroy . . . subtle human truths . " <P> One of the proposals , the Visual Artists Rights Bill , would also provide a 7% resale royalty on some art works fetching $1,000 or more . In this age of the $53.9 million Van Gogh , that would allow artists whose works increase in value  --  always just a fraction of the profession  --  to get a piece of the collector 's profits . Critics counter that a similar provision in California 's law has merely driven the sale of art off the books or out of state . <P> Current American law generally gives control over most kinds of property to its owner  --  an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to do with their cars . Yet every instinct says that art is no ordinary property . The proposals before Congress place it in a separate category by turning to " moral rights , " a legal concept dating back to the French Revolution . It permits artists to block the public display of their work in a defaced or modified form . Moral rights are also embodied in the Berne Convention , the international copyright agreement adopted by 76 countries , but the provision is one reason why the U.S. has never signed it . <P> The issue of artists ' rights has intensified in the U.S. with the spread of public art since the 1970s , spurred by a 1963 federal policy that one-half of 1% of the construction budget for Government buildings must go for the purchase of art . At a time when the aims of modernism and the tastes of a broad public are not always in accord , some of that art , like Tilted Arc , has met with hostility or indifference . One federal judge in Baltimore even organized his judicial colleagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the plaza of the courthouse where he worked , insisting that the piece could be a launching pad for terrorist attacks .
