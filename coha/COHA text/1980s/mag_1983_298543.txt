Terror and Marxism replace tolerance and prosperity <P> Once upon a time the former colony of Dutch Guiana seemed to be an enchanted tropical paradise . Its gentle , unusually tolerant melange of Creole , Indian , Chinese and Javanese inhabitants were blessed with rich farming lands , rivers teeming with fish and one of the world 's largest bauxite-producing economies . Upon Suriname 's independence in 1975 , the Dutch promised a generous allowance of $100 million annually for 15 years , giving the newly formed nation one of the highest per capita incomes in the developing world ( $2,500 ) . One in every three citizens owned a car ; living rooms were stocked with video recorders . When the police shot a demonstrator during an isolated outburst ten years ago , flowers were sent to the entire community . <P> But the fairy tale has become a horror story . Plainclothes police " watchdogs " arrest citizens at random . The university has been closed , along with all but the state-controlled press . Radio stations and trade union headquarters have been blown to rubble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resigned or been dismissed . Says one of the few locals unafraid to talk : " People are terrified and suspicious of informers everywhere .

The next morning all but one of them were dead . Doctors later found evidence of knife wounds and cigarette burns on the corpses ; teeth and jaws had been broken , while arms had been almost torn from their sockets . Labor Leader Cyril Daal had been ritually castrated . Bou terse , 37 , who reportedly killed two of the men , joyfully proclaimed " the building of a new Suriname . " But his 350,000 citizens were less sanguine . Over the past five months , 1,000 have fled ; those who remain are subdued . Says one exile : " Suriname has been transformed into a country of mutes . " <P> Bouterse had stumbled into power in 1980 . As a physical-education instructor fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he managed almost inadvertently to overthrow the democratically elected , but divisive , government of Henk Arron . At first , the new regime was so diffident that it hung up a suggestion box soliciting advice on how to run the country , and Bouterse , its popular and athletic leader , even resolved to complete his high school education . Only much later was it discovered that one of his tutors had become his mistress and was schooling him in the writings of Lenin and Marx .
