Coping with the New York blackout was easier than fending off imports <P> The break in a 68-year-old water main and the subsequent power outage that threw more than half of New York City 's garment district into darkness for three days earlier this month could have been a disaster for the industry , coming as it did in the midst of the crucial " market week " for next winter 's holiday and resort wear . But the tenacious and long-beleaguered garment-makers treated the blackout as just one more obstacle to be overcome . Manufacturers moved goods by flashlight and held showings in rented rooms . Loyal buyers unable to place orders booked return visits . Even the garment workers union helped out by allowing employees to put in an extra hour a day without charging overtime . <P> By last week the usual traffic jams , clutter and noise had returned to Seventh Avenue , or Fashion Avenue as the industry likes to call it .

Hardest hit among U.S. manufacturers is Manhattan 's Seventh Avenue , which has the largest share of domestic apparel sales . It is beset by relatively high labor costs , exorbitant rents and a panoply of other problems that come from doing business in the heart of a huge city . <P> New York is also being challenged by a host of new American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunbelt , have set up markets that are siphoning off a growing share of sales . So while New York was still coping with the aftereffects of the blackout last week , Atlanta was celebrating . The Atlanta Apparel Mart is the first stop after New York on the August fashion tour for many women 's wear manufacturers , and customers were placing orders in Atlanta that they could not make in New York . Said Bob Edelstein , regional sales director for Crazy Horse , a sportswear maker : " Many buyers I would normally see in New York , I 'm seeing in Atlanta . "
