Maggie loses a minister <P> Rejoice , again I say , rejoice ! " The old hymn thundered from 3,000 throats in the seaside town of Blackpool last week as Britain 's Conservative Party opened its annual conference . And why not rejoice ? It was the first gathering of the Tory clans since their historic election victory last June . There was even a dollop of frosting on the political cake in the form of two important Tory birthdays : the party 's 100th and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 's 58th . It was , then , an occasion for especially lusty renditions of God Save the Queen and Land of Hope and Glory . Above all , it was a moment of sweet triumph for Thatcher . <P> As it turned out , it was also a tune of deep embarrassment . Hours before her keynote speech on Friday , Thatcher accepted " with regret " the eye-catching resignation of Trade and Industry Secretary Cecil Parkinson , architect of the election landslide and one of her closest political advisers . Parkinson , 52 , fell from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his private secretary and longtime lover , would soon bear his child . He added that he would not divorce his wife of 26 years to marry Keays , although he admitted that he had promised to do so . The disclosure prompted a number of Tories to call for Parkinson 's head , but Thatcher characteristically decided to see the crisis through . She even asked conference organizers to arrange a warm welcome for him at Blackpool . <P> That , apparently , was too much for hitherto silent Keays . In a surprise statement in Friday 's London Times , she gave her side of the story and abruptly demolished what remained of Parkinson 's political career . " My baby was conceived in a longstanding , loving relationship which I had allowed to continue because I believed in our eventual marriage , " Keays declared . " It has been suggested that Mr. Parkinson only asked me to marry him after I became pregnant , when in fact he first did so in 1979 . In May , when I knew of my pregnancy , Mr. Parkinson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Parkinson and Thatcher learned of the interview in the predawn hours Friday . The resignation was announced at 9:45 a.m . Said a senior Tory minister : " At some point , someone in this affair lied . " In the messiest possible way , Thatcher had lost a close personal protege and left herself open to questions about her judgment of people and events . <P> The Parkinson affair was merely the most visible of Thatcher 's concerns last week . Indeed , even before Blackpool , she was on the defensive against , of all things , accusations of aimless drift and indecision . The most serious charge : that she has failed to turn the policies of her first term into a clear blueprint for her second . Increasingly , the criticism has come from her own party . The most serious challenge was on the economic front . Last June , Thatcher campaigned on a hastily drafted manifesto calling for , among other things , reductions in taxes and government spending .
