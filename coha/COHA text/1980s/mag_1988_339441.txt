There are 8 million stories in the Naked City  --  which is twelve stories too many . Last week the U.S. Supreme Court let stand a lower court ruling requiring a New York City developer to tear down the top dozen floors of a new 31-story condominium on Manhattan 's East Side . The concrete superstructure for all 31 floors was in place in 1986 when the city found that the building violated zoning laws and ordered it cut down to size . The developer , Parkview Associates , kept working on the building and went to court , arguing that there ( had been an error in the city 's zoning map . But Parkview should have noticed the error , a New York appeals court ruled in February . Decapitation of the condo could cost $9 million .
