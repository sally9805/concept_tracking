 | No one could die like Frank . His favorite game when we were kids , playing in sand dunes behind his family 's summer home in northern Michigan , was war . Frank , his younger brother Bill and I would spend long afternoons digging trenches in the sand , making forts and playing out epic battles with stick guns , painstakingly whittled and sandpapered to look like old flintlocks . A virtuoso of sound effects , he would animate the battle of the moment with a soundtrack of exploding howitzers and hacking machine guns , popping rifles and bullets ricocheting off rocks , pinging , ptooing and finally finding their mark , thudding into a body . When he went down , which was often , the fall generally started in midair , as he was leaping over a sumac bush in a last-ditch surprise attack . His face would grimace with the imagined pain from the first bullet to his leg . Heroically , he 'd squeeze off a couple more shots , nailing the last Nazis in the bunker . He 'd take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the neck , and , dropping his spent gun , flinging his arms and legs out and emitting a fatal " aahyeeeeh , " he would crumple onto the sand . Only after some terminal flourishes sure to elicit laughter from his rapt audience of two would he expire . His real death this year was violent but had none of the glory he had imagined . It snuck up on him in the middle of the night , when no one was watching . Frank Fuller Fowle III , 42 , was murdered last January 19 , stabbed in the heart in a motel parking lot in Georgia by a 23-year-old cocaine user who had asked him for a quarter . Frank was driving home to St. Louis at the time , and pulled off the interstate around midnight to get some sleep . There were two motels at the exit ramp ; he picked the one where the man who would kill him waited . He parked his car , a Mercedes 300E , outside Room 112 at the Days Inn on the edge of Forsyth , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some of his things . He dictated a few thoughts into his recorder , part of a daily chronicle of his travels and observations he kept for offspring and posterity . Frank took a sweeping view of his life . He was a bard , a latterday Homer who traveled to schools around the country enacting scenes from Greek classics and , as he put it , " telling of the deeds of heroes . " Still pumped up from a performance he had given that evening , he went back out to his car to get some books to read when a man approached him . He fought his assailant According to investigating officers , who obtained a confession from the alleged assailant after his capture the next morning , Frank retrieved a change purse from his car to get a quarter . The man , a construction worker from Forsyth named Darrell Bowden , apparently was n't satisfied with small change from the owner of a Mercedes and attacked him with a knife . Frank did what some victims are advised not to do : He fought back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then down on the ground amid the spilled change . The assailant cut and stabbed him several times in the back , puncturing a lung . A witness behind a curtained window heard Frank cry out , " . . . But I 'll give you what you want ! " Frank managed to break away and , bleeding profusely , adrenaline coursing through his body , he ran toward the motel office . If his assailant was looking for a chance to escape from an incident that had escalated beyond his control ,  | this was it . For whatever reasons , he did not take that choice . Instead , according to authorities , he ran after Frank and stabbed him fatally in the chest . Frank fell to the pavement , rolled onto his back and died . The assailant took his wallet with $200 in it and ran off into the night . Thus abruptly ended the life of one of my best childhood friends . He was an innocent victim of a random crime and , as his father put it , extraordinary bad luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Frank 's death , " the rabbi asserted sensibly at the funeral , trying to head off a troubled disposition of the grief-stricken to seek just such a meaning . I could n't accept that at the time , and I do n't accept it now . If nothing else , Frank 's death marked the end of my own childhood . In the months that followed , as I sorted out facts , speculations and jumbled feelings about Frank 's death by talking with his family and other friends , I tried to make sense out of his senseless murder , to seek a connection between his existence and his death . Others shared this urge , wondering whether Frank had been predestined to be killed this way , whether he had asked for it , or whether God had just taken the way He gives , for reasons unrevealed to ordinary mortals . Shock , anger and grief overwhelmed all else at the funeral , but underneath , this disturbing insistence on meaning had already been born , resisting the seeming randomness of his death and leading each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives were really about . He looked for adventure and romance That his death stirred such questions would have made Frank smile , because that is what he tried to do in his life . He championed free will and the heroic ideal and would have argued that , as a philosophical matter , there is no such thing as an innocent victim , that we are not simple pawns of external circumstances , that we all shape in some way our own fate . Frank was most certainly an innocent . He grew up in Winnetka , a wealthy Chicago suburb , the son of a corporate attorney and a corporate attorney 's daughter . Suburban affluence tends to breed innocence in children , but Frank was innocent by nature . As a boy he was a charmer who regaled the family at dinner with mimicry of movie actors and teased his brother , sisters and mother to distraction . Much like Herman Melville 's Billy Budd , a favorite character of his , he was a handsome , carefree sailor bobbing about on sunny seas , looking for adventure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or dangers beneath the surface . As he grew up , his winning , childlike innocence seemed increasingly eccentric to people . In an odd , preposterous way , Frank never let go of the dreams , ideals and glory days of his youth , investing them with prodigious enthusiasm and transforming them into a lonesome crusade that eventually steered him off the interstate to that desolate parking lot . Like other American boys , he wanted to be a hero , a doer of great deeds . Unlike most of us , however , the increasing gap between his dreams and troublesome realities hardened his conviction that he was destined for some great role , to lead a life that was noble . A landscape of malls and money , of career moves and family obligations proved dishearteningly ill-suited for noble deeds and heroic action . It did not beckon like the storied whaling towns of New England or the frontiers of the Wild West he read about as a child . And his romanticism set him up for disappointment . He journeyed up to Alaska one summer with another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing boats . He came back in debt and disillusioned with the less-than-noble natures of the commercial fishermen he worked with . After college , the Vietnam War offered a promising opportunity for heroic experience , by either resisting it or fighting in it . But , a campus carouser and basically apolitical , he was oddly disconnected from the great events of the moment and did not have strong feelings about the war . He fell in love instead , got married and then joined the Navy , following in his father 's footsteps . To Frank , The Navy was The Sea , the province of Joseph Conrad 's sea sagas and Melville 's Moby Dick . Few of his shipmates shared his romantic views , however , much less respected the hearty gusto with which he threw himself into his duties as an officer and a disciplinarian . Frank came to be regarded as something of an oddball , rushing up to the bow of the ship in storms to feel the sea heave and the salt water burn his face , imagining what Captain Ahab felt tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . When he was blamed for running a ship aground in San  | Diego , an accident for which a board of inquiry later exonerated him , he abandoned the Navy . He and his wife had a son but then divorced . He hawked encyclopedias , Fuller brushes and Charmin toilet paper ; played guitar , sang songs and did comic routines in saloons , and completed law school . But law practice turned out to be tedious and did not hold him long . He roamed from one great adventure to another In the end , he simply conjured up a career to meet his grandiose expectations . He became a traveling bard , roaming at will from one great adventure of literature to another , dramatizing for students scenes from Homer 's Iliad , Plato 's Republic , Pericles ' " Funeral Oration , " Coleridge 's " The Rime of the Ancient Mariner " and the Declaration of Independence . He also conducted discussions on how the heroic ideals embodied in these works related to people 's lives today . " What nobler deed can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he noted in his journal . It was an improbable vocation , inspired by a set of the " Great Books of the Western World " that he bought for $125 at a flea market and read cover to cover , a Socratic law-school professor of jurisprudence and a Richard Burton recording of the " Ancient Mariner . " He was so moved by the recording that he memorized the poem and persuaded a college group to let him perform it for a $15 fee . Soon he mastered Book 22 of the Iliad , the tale of Hector 's death at the hands of fleet-footed Achilles , Frank 's all-time hero , and took his show on the road to schools in St. Louis and Chicago . His act took off fast after the Wall Street Journal featured him on the front page in 1981 under a skeptical headline , " Evangelical Lawyer Spans U.S. to Preach a Gospel of Homer ; Frank Fowle , Alias The Bard , Is a One-Man Iliad ' Show ; Just Greek to Some Pupils . " The more preposterous his career seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique calling in life . " A true bard is an inspired performer " is how he described what he did for prospective schools . " He unites the soul of the poet with the soul of the audience . And since a bard tells of the deeds of heroes , the audience is united with greatness . " At times , he believed that God spoke through him , that he was carrying out God 's will . " I have strange power of speech , " he wrote , invoking Coleridge 's Mariner . He was also seized by doubt , worried by practical considerations and fearful of distracting temptations . Each spring , he anguished over bookings . He imagined that various setbacks would make him lose heart . Before his second marriage , he worried that no one would marry him because of the constant travel and lack of financial stability . Once he found a woman who loved and accepted him , he worried that he could n't be the husband and father he wanted to be for the same reasons . Irene , his second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converted to Judaism . He was an Episcopalian , and this leap of faith did n't set right with either family at first , particularly Irene 's . Her father never accepted him . He thought Frank " a showman , " she says . Others agreed . " My friends think I 'm a little crazy , " he wrote in his journal . But he had come to believe in what he was doing as an end in itself . " Dad was happiest performing , " says Frank IV , 19 . Last year , Frank did 115  | shows , bringing his total to nearly 1,000 . He was on the road over 100 days . A lawyer who had given up work to rear their children , Irene did not like Frank 's being away from home so much , and she worried about all the driving . Money was no longer a problem . She came from a wealthy family , and Frank 's income was nearing six figures . He barely broke even when he first started barding in 1978 , logging thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , and a way of life . When one school could n't pay him , he accepted two basketballs . But last year , he charged up to $1,500 a show . He bought a Mercedes and later traded it in for a bigger model , which he christened " Fleet Achilles . " Frank was a bard , but deep down , maybe out on the interstate somewhere , pushing the Mercedes up over 100 on a moonlit night , it is easy to imagine that the spirit of the great runner Achilles stirred inside him . " Frank was out there , teasing the gods , " says his sister Margaret , 45 . When someone close to you is murdered , you exhibit an obsessive curiosity about the details of the crime . Bill paced out his brother 's final steps in the motel parking lot ; it was something he had to do . Others speculated about whether Frank might have done anything to tilt the event . Should he have fought back or could he have talked the guy out of it ? Or if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessarily ? One unavoidable speculation was that he sized up this midnight approach as a moment for the heroism he glorified . He could not believe anyone would kill him Frank had but a few seconds to influence what was happening to him . Whether he saw an opportunity to be the hero he told tales of or was simply trying to give the assailant what he wanted , the sad irony may be that his nature could not anticipate , would not allow , the idea that anyone would want to kill him for real . Or the truth may be that the very inspiration that made him seem innocent and out of place , an enthusiastic prophet of ancient virtues in a time of amorality and despair , led him to recognize evil and refuse to compromise with it . If Frank 's attempt to defend himself signifies his character and spirit , it does not change the fact that he was the victim of an assault , and does not suggest he shares blame for what happened . His assailant , awaiting trial for murder and a possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleaded not guilty and declined to be interviewed for this article . He also escaped from jail on July 14 and was caught two hours later . His defense attorney , Harold Martin , claims that mutual combat occurred , making a case for voluntary manslaughter , not murder . Assailants often justify their crimes by saying they were provoked , and defense attorneys try to discredit victims or raise doubt to lessen a charge or soften a sentence . The prosecutor in Forsyth , Dist . Atty . Tommy Floyd , says such a claim is unlikely to stand up : " In Georgia , you ca n't claim self-defense if you start a sequence of events with an armed robbery that leads to murder . " Frank dedicated his performances to the idea of justice and labored hard to define the concept . " What is the mark , the sign , the indication of injustice ? " he wrote in a law quarterly essay entitled " Just Decisions . " " The answer is pain , suffering , hurt , injury . . . . Many people would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign of justice . But would n't the parties have preferred it if no injury had occurred in the first place ? Therefore , justice is a state or condition of no injury . A good word that describes an injuryfree condition is healthy . Thus , I say that justice is health . " By his definition , no justice can atone for his murder . There can be no repair of the injury , no health . His family suffers enduring hurt . " I 'm very proud of Frank , " says Frank 's father , 81 . " And it makes me really good and sad that he 's not around here any more . " His oldest sister , Lisa , 47 , plans to attend every day of the trial . " I ca n't get past the murder , " she says . " Frank did n't die ; he was killed . I want to be there to see justice done , or if it is not done , to know why . " Another sister , Susan , Margaret 's twin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that society redress the injustices that lead people to cocaine and murder . " Frank F. Fowle had a tremendous gift to give the world , " she wrote . " Now we must live out the extent of our lives without him ; we will never stop grieving , for we loved him dearly , our  | beloved dreamer who taught us to live our dreams . " Frank 's wife Irene , a 35-year-old mother of two young children , is. a widow before her time . Her life , one day full of the happy wonder and domestic pulls of early motherhood , is now filled with sadness and anger . " I live in torture , " she says . Her youngest child , Sam , 2 , can not comprehend what has happened . Sunny-natured and irrepressible like Frank , he often stares out the front door , looking for his father 's car to drive up . Rachel , 3 , understands her father wo n't be coming home any more but feels he can still see and hear her , that he is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting home from preschool , she likes to take it outside in the early evening before she goes to bed and hold it up for her father to see , who sparkles down his approval . " I wish I could touch Daddy , " she tells her mom . " There 's this feeling of unfinished business " At his funeral , on a Sunday a few days after his murder , I watched Frank 's coffin being lowered into the ground , stunned , that the life of a man with such vigor could be stopped so suddenly , so prematurely and for so little cause . He was a man hitting his stride , and I had not had time to appreciate it . " There 's Frank 's death , but there 's also the death of the relationship , " says Lisa . " None of us got a chance to close . There 's this feeling of unfinished business . " I remembered the last time I saw him , up in Michigan , leading my oldest boy and Bill 's two young sons up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer afternoons of childhood . I followed and he drew me into the game . We chose up sides , planted flags to be defended and scrambled into the underbrush to hide . The kids giggled and ran about madly . And before long Frank did one of his dramatic deaths . That 's the image that came to me at his graveside , Frank leaping MD , CArGHroN UsNgwR headlong over the sumac , his teeth flashing white against the blue sky , the falling hero . The Monday after the funeral , I went back to work as usual . Life went on callously as if nothing had happened , a lake swallowing a skipping stone that hit the water wrong . The emotional wounds had already started a mysterious and unstoppable healing , concentric ripples fading out into calm .
