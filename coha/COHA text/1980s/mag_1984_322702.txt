Frederick Painton , the Paris-based senior writer who worked on this week 's cover stories marking the 40th anniversary of Dday , got his first glimpse of France in June 1945 . Painton , then an 18-year-old private first class , eventually wound up in Germany as part of an intelligence unit , where he edited rambling interrogation reports on high-ranking German prisoners . " I found my year of occupation duty unpleasant , " says Painton . " I still retain a sense of shock at the spectacle of a broken , defeated nation . " <P> For his story on the Normandy battlefield , Painton crisscrossed the 60-mile stretch of landing beaches . At Pointe du Hoc , he explored the 100-ft. cliffs that U.S. Rangers had scaled in the face of enemy fire . " The remains of German bunkers are the only evidence that a war had been fought there , " he reports . " Those bunkers were blasted into chunks of concrete that now resemble tilting Celtic dolmens . " <P> Arthur White , a correspondent in TIME 's London bureau , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the Normandy invasion . He found his assignment " one of bittersweet nostalgia , " since he was then stationed in London as a 20-year-old soldier-reporter for Stars and Stripes , the daily newspaper of the U.S. armed forces . <P> Senior Writer Otto Friedrich , who wrote the main cover story with the assistance of Reporter-Researcher Anne Hopkins , was also a newsman at the time of Dday , but on a small Vermont paper ; at 15 , a recent high school graduate , he was too young to fight . " But I followed the war closely , " he says . " I remember how excited we all got on Dday . We knew it was the beginning of the end . " <P> During the course of his cover labors , Friedrich discovered a little-known story about the D-day photograph that appears across pages 10 and 11 in this issue . Legendary Photojournalist Robert Capa snapped a series of pictures of the Normandy landing while under heavy fire , and then sent the film to the London office of LIFE .

In fact , a 17-year-old darkroom assistant in London had applied too much heat as he dried Capa 's negatives , destroying 98 of the 106 images and blurring the others , including Capa 's now famous shot . In 1954 , Capa was killed on assignment in Indochina when he stepped on a mine . The fumbling young darkroom assistant in London , Larry Burrows , went on to become a famous photojournalist himself , winning the Robert Capa award for his heroic 1960s coverage of the Viet Nam War . In 1971 , Burrows was killed in a helicopter crash in Laos .
