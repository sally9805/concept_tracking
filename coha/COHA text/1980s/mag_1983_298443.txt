<P> A vote for Queen and country <P> <P> The motion before the Oxford Union , the university 's prestigious 160-year-old debating society , had a familiar ring : " This house would not fight for Queen and country . " Exactly 50 years earlier , on Feb. 9 , 1933 , the Union debated the same subject in the same wood-paneled hall . On that occasion , memories of World War I trench warfare were still vivid , and the motion was carried , 275 to 153 . Only a few people seemed concerned that Adolf Hitler had just come to power in Germany . Even so , the pacifists ' victory stirred an outcry . The Daily Express ranted against the " woozy-minded Communists , practical jokers and sexual indeterminates of Oxford , " while Winston Churchill deplored " this abject , squalid , shameless avowal . " <P> Last week the Union resoundingly reversed that pacifist stand . After 3 hrs. of impassioned speeches from undergraduate and guest speakers , the motion was defeated 416 to 187 . YES ! cried a Daily Mail headline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , the third Oxford vote to do battle . In 1965 , and again in 1981 , similar debates were held , and the no votes won , though by narrow margins . <P> There were some connecting threads between last week 's debate and its 1933 counterpart . The Oxford Union 's treasurer back then was Labor Party Leader Michael Foot , who did not speak on that famous first occasion but today advocates unilateral nuclear disarmament for Britain . One of the featured speakers last week was Member of Parliament Douglas Hogg , who , like his father before him , argued the case for fighting . Another was Historian Max Beloff , 69 , who as an Oxford undergraduate 50 years ago supported the pacifist line . This time Beloff , a lord , was on the other side . Said he : " Those of us who voted for the first motion have a duty to atone . Most of those who in this house said that they would not fight did , in fact , fight in the war . " <P> Coming as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western Europe , the debate played to a packed house . Spectators listened politely as Pacifist Leader Helen John warned , " If there 's a war , we wo n't be able to debate again in 50 years . " But they jeered when she called Britain " an occupied country " because of the U.S. military bases there . Conversely , they applauded when former Prime Minister Lord Alec Douglas-Home said , " I am fearful when I see unilateralists sending out signals to a dictatorship that is mobilized with enormous armed forces and practices its doctrine in Czechoslovakia , Afghanistan and Poland . " Home and Beloff carried the day . showing that , at Oxford at least , pacifism is non-U.
