txt EOPLE KEEP PHONING . " When are you going to follow the lead of your colleague William Satire and make public disclosure of your financial position ? " they keep asking . " Never . " is my answer . A man has his pride . It is not served by public confession that one of his principal assets is a 1969 automobile whose value is listed by the state bureaucracy as $50 . What is important is how rich a person feels . Walk on the sunny side of the street , the song Arises , and you can be rich as Rockefeller . Well . you ca n't stay on the sunny side of the street while disclosing ownership of a car that bureaucrats sneer at . It reminds you that that car 's interior lights have not worked for two years . Just thinking about it moves you over to the cloudy side of the street . expecting to he rained on . ONE OF ** most valuable possessions is a library of about 700 books . I regard it as priceless and likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight titles that are apt to become rare as the Mon , Majority purges our public libraries of titles that nil moral folk the wrong way . Because of moving to smaller digs . I had to sell another 700 hooks a year or so ago . Though just . as Mr. Baker 's principal asset . precious as the ones I kept . the used-book dealer priced them at $75. which indicates that the market value of my priceless library is only $25 higher than the value of my automobile . The reason I had to move to smaller digs , incidentally , was that I could not amass St million , which the landlord lVP% asking for the property I then occupied . It was a row house of the sort for which people in west Baltimore used to bid as high as 522,000 when I was a lad , though of course this one came equipped Wilt a fantastic population of cockroaches . It does n't help your pride much to confess publicly that you could n't get together SI million for a $22,000 house . Why Satire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me . It is not so embarrassing to confess to part ownership . with a bank , of a pleasant house . in IlIassachusetts . THINKING OF THAT house can make y011 feel almost as rich as Rockefeller , for it is in a town singularly free of Americans exercising their constitutional right to bear pistols , which means you never have to worry about the sweet . aged lady who occupies it being gunned down on tier way home with the groceries . But then , once you start disclosing it . its back to ? the cloudy side of the street as you toss into the balance sheet that gaping hole in the hallway ceiling and the kitchen where the plumber took the radiator away last summer and never brought it back , and where you have to wear an overcoat and gloves to make breakfast these winter days , and where the sink pipes are doubtless freezing . Satire . why do you want to make people think on such things ? I prefer to dwell oil the paper stored in metal boxes . the paper that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the insurance policies purchased 30 years ago , the stock purchased back when President Nixon said all Americans should buy stock . By selling those stocks and using the proceeds to repay the bank what I borrowed to buy them . I would have not only enough capital to pay the tax on them but also enough left over to buy a tiny , brand new Japanese car with interior lights that work . The insurance policies , ground down by decades of inflation . are worth approximately S50 in the currency with which they were bought . IN SIIORT . IT 'S back to the cloudy side of the street . The insurance policies and my 1909 car together are worth a paltry $100 , and the stock is only sufficient to buy a new car so small that I would n't be able to find it at night in the hack seat of my old car because of those interior lights being on the blink . That 's all right . I have my electronic equipment . My 11-inch Hitachi TV set that gets the sound but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stereo three years ago , and my Sony portable radio-cassette player with the aerial broken off . And of course , there is salary , blessed salary , paid regularly by the Times despite advice from so many , readers for the publisher to stop throwing his money away . Moreover , I anticipate additional wealth from a book that , if it follows my past book form , will be bought exclusively by members of my family . Do not sneer , Safire . I have a very big family . No one should get the idea from this that Iam not as rich as Rockefeller , because I still have to ' list the greatest asset of all . I have credit cards .
