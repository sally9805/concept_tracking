The Baltic republics , it is often said , are the " laboratory " of Mikhail Gorbachev 's experiment in liberalization . The metaphor captures the exhilaration and ominousness of what is happening , both there in the Baltics and throughout the U.S.S.R. Glasnost , elections and free-market economics will help save the Soviet system from itself , or the mixture will explode . <P> The citizens of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania love to watch grainy black- and-white documentary films of what it was like 50 years ago , before their lands were seized by Stalin , invaded by Hitler , then colonized by the Kremlin . They remember themselves as having been self-reliant yet outward looking . These are among the virtues that Gorbachev is now preaching for the Soviet Union as a whole . He is a Westernizer , in the tradition of an enlightened but ultimately frustrated school of 19th century Russian reformers . The Baltics are already the most Westernized of the 15 Soviet republics , and they are eager to become more so . <P> The Soviet economy , all but bankrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has actually deteriorated . He is beginning to get the blame . He desperately needs to show that perestroika is working somewhere , and the Baltics may be the best chance he has . <P> Yet the three republics are also the cause of Gorbachev 's greatest anxiety . Thanks to his policies of decentralization and democratization , the powers that be in the Baltics are looking less nervously toward Moscow , but they are also listening far more attentively to their own people . <P> Increasingly , Baltic leaders are hearing demands for " national rights . " For some proponents the phrase means full sovereignty , now . For others it means autonomy within a radically more lenient U.S.S.R. Estonian officials are busily planning to introduce their own currency , airline and diplomatic missions abroad . The so-called popular fronts , with their platforms calling for regional self-determination , are well on their way to taking over the power structure . The secessionists and the federalists disagree about tactics and timetable , but not about the dream of independence . <P> No wonder there is fear and anger in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader can afford to give up Soviet power , not to mention Soviet territory . Many American officials share this concern , although they must be careful about saying so . In a conceit of diplomatic formalism that until recently seemed quaint and futile , the U.S. Government has never recognized the legality of the Baltic annexation . Support for human and civil rights is , or is certainly supposed to be , a constant of American foreign policy . <P> But now there is a new factor : George Bush is a Gorbachevite himself . He does n't put it that way , nor does he like others to do so . But the fact remains that for the first time in 72 years , the U.S. has a stake in the survival and success of a particular Soviet leader . Bush does not want to see the Baltic laboratory blow up any more than do the people who live there . Therefore , the American President is plugging not just for the citizens of those tragic republics trapped by history within the Soviet Union , but also for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
