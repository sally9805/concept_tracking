Governors debate federalism <P> When the nation 's Governors arrived in Washington last week for their annual winter meeting , they were far more concerned about the immediate implications of Ronald Reagan 's red-ink budget and its drastic cuts in domestic spending than his heralded long-term plans for a New Federalism . But since the Governors had long complained about Washington 's heavy hand on a multitude of federal aid programs for the states , they could scarcely ignore Reagan 's potentially historic proposals . In something of an Administration victory , the Governors wound up spending most of their three days debating federalism rather than berating the budget . <P> The result , however , was far from a ringing endorsement of Reagan 's New Federalism proposals . The keystone of the Reagan plan was that the Federal Government would assume all costs of the fast-growing $30 billion Medicaid program , which benefits some 22 million poor people . In return , the states would take over the full burden of the nation 's basic welfare program , Aid to Families with Dependent Children , which costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire tab for the $ 11 billion food stamp program . <P> The Governors had no quarrel with Washington 's willingness to finance all of Medicaid , but , by a vote of 36 to 5 , they rejected the idea that the states should assume the AFDC and food stamp burden . This was in keeping with the traditional position of the National Governors Association that income-support programs for the poor are logically a national responsibility . Instead , the Governors offered to accept as state responsibilities a wide variety of other programs , including education , transportation , child nutrition and criminal justice . Total cost of those programs : about $31 billion . <P> To the surprise of the Governors , their counterproposal was not immediately rejected by the President when they presented it to him in a White House meeting . Instead , both sides agreed to engage in more detailed bargaining before any legislation is presented to Congress . After that , predicted Vermont 's Republican Governor , Richard Snelling , chairman of the Governors Association , " the Congress will decide , and it wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be what we want . " <P> One reason the Governors did not spend more time addressing the Reagan budget , noted Tennessee 's Republican Governor , Lamar Alexander , " is that none of us expects the President 's budget to pass . " After meeting with the President , Democratic Governor John Carlin of Kansas reported that Reagan showed he had not lost touch with reality , admitting he did not expect his New Federalism to pass both the House and Senate this year either . Thus the debate was taking place in something of avoid . Observed Carlin : " When I talk to the Kansas farmer or small businessman , there 's not too much concern about the New Federalism . They want to know about interest rates and the economy . "
