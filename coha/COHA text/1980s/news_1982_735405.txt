txt Moody 's Investors Service and Standard &; Poor 's Corp . lowered their ratings on Allis-Chalmers Corp . debt , with Moody 's citing a " marked reduction of protection " for the company 's debt securities and a " strained liquidity position . " Separately , analysts said that Allis will post a large loss for 1982 , that it could default on certain debt covenants before yearend and that it will need waivers from its senior lenders to continue paying preferredshare dividends in 1983 . In response to an inquiry , a company spokesman disclosed that earlier this month Allis imposed a pay freeze on all its and Canadian employees through year-end , cut corporate officers ' salaries and directors ' fees 5% , suspended company contributions to the savings program for salaried employees earning more than 53,000 a month and froze hiring of salaried personnel . Moody 's said it lowered the long-term debt ratings of the maker of agricultural and industrial equipment , and of its nonconsolidated finance company unit to Ba-2 from Baa-3 . The rating agency also lowered its rating on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ba-3 from Baa-3 . It lowered the finance company 's commercial-paper rating to " not prime " from prime-3 . The new ratings indicate that the securities are speculative . Standard &; Poor 's lowered the long-term debt ratings of Allis and its finance company to double-B-plus from triple-B-plus . It lowered its rating on the preferred stock to single-B-plus from triple-B-minus . It cut the finance company 's commercial-paper rating to single-B from single-A-2 . The rating agency also removed both Allis and the finance company from its CreditWatch list of securities that are under study for a possible rating change . Moody 's said the rating changes were prompted by weak demand for the company 's products , by extremely competitive pricing in its principal markets and by the higher cost of financing sales and inventories . " The outlook for a protracted period of agricultural machinery overcapacity and weak demand , combined with softness in Allis-Chalmers ' other segments , preclude any meaningful recovery for the foreseeable future , " it added . Standard &; Poor 's did n't offer any explanation for its rating changes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Milwaukee . an Allis spokesman would say only that the company was " obviously disappointed . " Earlier this month , Allis reported a second-quarter loss of 515.8 million and said it expected " continued erosion " of earnings in the second half . Meanwhile , some analysts have increased their estimates for Allis 's full-year loss . Jerry Anderson , who follows the company for the investment firm of Sanford C. Bernstein &; Co. , for example , currently expects a 1982 loss of about 561 million , before any special gains , compared with a 1981 loss of $28.8 million , which included a $17.5 million write-down of the company 's investment in a joint venture . For 1982 's first half , Allis reported a loss of $13.2 million , after a 516.7 million gain in the first quarter from the sale of an interest in another joint venture . The gloomy outlook has prompted concern that Allis later this year may have to seek waivers from its lenders to avoid defaulting on certain covenants in its revolving credit agreement . The agreement requires the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and net working capital of $215 million . As of March 31 , net worth totaled about $629 million while working capital amounted to $256 million . In any case , analysts said Allis almost certainly will need waivers from its senior lenders to continue paying dividends on its preferred shares next year . The company , which has omitted common share dividends since December , obtained previous waivers so it could pay the preferred dividends throughout this year . The Allis spokesman would say only that " we 're having discussions continuously with our banks and long-term lenders as a matter of course . " He added that the question of waivers to pay preferred dividends in 1983 " is one of the subjects being discussed .

The Series C preferred . which was issued in May 1981 , closed at $34.
