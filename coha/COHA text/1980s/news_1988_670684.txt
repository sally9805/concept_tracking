The hives will occur even if Timmy drinks orange juice and another personality appears while the juice is still being digested . What ' s more , if Timmy comes back while the allergic reaction is present , the itching of the hives will cease immediately , and the water-filled blisters will begin to subside. // Such remarkable differences in the same body are leading scientists to study the physiology of patients with multiple personalities to assess how much psychological states can affect the body ' s biology , for better or worse . The researchers are discovering that such patients offer a unique window on how the mind and body can interact. // Researchers feel that the study of these patients may also have significant implications for people with the medical disorders that are found to differ from one sub-personality to another . If the mechanisms through which these differences occur can be discovered , it may be possible to teach people some similar degree of control over these problems. // " We ' re finding the most graphic demonstrations to date of the power of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Braun , a psychiatrist at Rush-Presbyterian-St . Luke ' s Medical Center in Chicago , and a leading pioneer in the research. // " If the mind can do this in tearing down body tissue , I think it suggests the same potential for healing , " said Dr. Braun , who directs a 10-bed psychiatric unit that uses psychotherapy , hypnosis and drugs to treat people with multiple personalities . He said he believed that the drastic physical changes seen in patients going from personality to personality could be duplicated for emotionally normal people under hypnosis. // In people with multiple personalities , there is a strong psychological separation between each sub-personality ; each will have his own name and age , and often some specific memories and abilities . Frequently , for example , personalities will differ in handwriting , artistic talent or even in knowledge of foreign languages. // Multiple personalities typically develop in people who were severely and repeatedly abused as children , apparently as a means to protect themselves against the pain of the abuse . Often only one or two of the sub-personalities will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory or experience of the pain . It is unclear why some abused children develop the syndrome while others do not. // For more than a century clinicians have occasionally reported isolated cases of dramatic biological changes in people with multiple personalities as they switched from one to another . These include the abrupt appearance and disappearance of rashes , welts , scars and other tissue wounds ; switches in handwriting and handedness ; epilepsy , allergies and color blindness that strike only when a given personality is in control of the body. // Today , using refined research techniques , scientists are bringing greater rigor to the study of multiple personalities and focusing on a search for the mechanisms that produce the varying physiological differences in each personality . <> <> Reaction to Medication // One of the problems for psychiatrists trying to treat patients with multiple personalties is that , depending which personality is in control , a patient can have drastically different reactions to a given psychiatric medication . For instance , it is almost always the case that one or several of the personalities of a given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences in responses to drugs among the sub-personalities often parallel those ordinarily found when the same drug at the same dose is given to a child , rather than an adult. // In a recent book , " The Treatment of Multiple Personality Disorder , " published by the American Psychiatric Press , Dr. Braun describes several instances in which different personalities in the same body responded differently to a given dose of the same medication . A tranquilizer , for instance , made a childish personality of one patient sleepy and relaxed , but gave adult personalities confusion and racing thoughts . An anti-convulsant prescribed for epilepsy that was given another patient had no effect on the personalities except those under the age of 12. // In another patient , 5 milligrams of diazepam , a tranquilizer , sedated one personality , while 100 milligrams had little effect on another personality. // Some of the recent findings on such changes will be reported at an international conference on multiple personalities that Dr. Braun will convene next October in Chicago . The reports will include other physical differences from personality to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different neurological and sensory profiles . <> <> Optical Differences // One of those reports will be on a study by Scott Miller , a psychologist at the University of Utah , of optical differences in people with multiple personality . Dr. Miller had an opthalmologist give a battery of standard optical tests to 10 patients and a control group of nonpatients . After each battery , the opthalmologist would leave the room while the patient switched personalties , sometimes at will and sometimes with prompting , then return and repeat the test. // The study included a control group of another 10 people who feigned switching personalties , unknown to the examiner , to remove a potential source of bias. // The study , which will be published in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease , found that there were significant changes in visual acuity , in the shape and curvature of the eye and in refraction from personality to personality in the real patients , but hardly any among the others tested. // The opthalmic exam also found some clinical differences apart from the standard tests . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35 . When the five-year-old was examined , she had a condition , common in childhood , known as " lazy eye , " in which one eye turns in toward the nose . The condition was not present in the 17-year-old or the 35-year-old. // Similar differences were found in other patients . " One patient had had his left eye injured in a fight , so that it turned out , " said Dr. Miller . " But the condition only appeared in one of his personalities . It disappeared in the others , nor was there any evidence of muscle imbalance. " // The study corroborates an observation of vision differences that had often been made by those treating multiple-personality cases . " Many patients have told me they have a drawer full of eyeglasses at home , and they never are quite sure which to bring when they go out , " Dr. Braun said . <> <> How Mind Regulates Biology // The medical phenomena being discovered in multiple personalities stretch the imagination , but researchers believe that they represent only the extreme end of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say , are graphic examples of the power of states of mind to regulate the body ' s biology . By studying them , researchers hope to find clues to links between mind and body that can help people with other psychiatric problems , as well as point the way to powers of healing that may one day be of use in treating normal medical patients. // The lesson for psychophysiology from multiple personalities is that a given personality has as its biological underpinning a specific pattern of mental and biological states , according to Dr. Frank Putnam , a psychiatrist at the Laboratory of Developmental Psychology at the National Institute of Health . In a sense , Dr. Putnam said , there is a " biological self " that corresponds to the psychological self ; as the psychological one shifts , so does the biological. // " We have a work self and a play self , for instance , but we are the same person , " said Dr. Putnam . " But each of those selves has its own repertoire of emotional states , memories and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor differences are seen in their extremes in the patients with multiple personality. " // The biological differences found in the patients , Dr. Putnam believes , reflect the range of states of mind that each sub-personality typically manifests . Many of them are extreme : the terrror of a frightened child , the hatred of an avenger. // " A given state of consciousness has its biological reality , " said Dr. Putnam . " By keeping these states separate and distinct , the patients create biologically separate selves . " <> <> Mechanism of Change // Dr. Putnam , who has done extensive research on patients with multiple personalities , is now focusing his interest on how they switch from one personality to another . During the switch , there is typically a period of seconds or even minutes when heart rate , breath rate and other physiological markers show a disorganization , which is followed by a new pattern typical of the personality that is emerging. // Some of the most striking changes occur in the tension levels of the person ' s facial muscles . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to Dr. Putnam. // The changes also include blood flow patterns in the brain , according to findings by Dr. Putnam and other researchers . The blood flow changes were observed while different personalities performed the same mental tasks. // " The transitions in children from one extreme state to another is every bit as abrupt as in the patients , " said Dr. Putnam . " You see it in the child who switches from crying to laughing , or who cries himself to sleep . Normally , adults don ' t switch that abruptly ; one of the tasks of growing is learning to keep the switching under control . Children have to make an effort so that their school self doesn ' t behave like their home self , for instance. " // In the children who respond to severe abuse by developing multiple personalities , Dr. Putnam believes , the usual integration of various " selves " did not occur . Such children seem to make use of two psychological capacities to protect themselves against the pain of abuse . One is the ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypnotic trance , an ability that peaks at around the age of nine . Another is the capacity to dissociate , to separate one aspect of experience from another. // " It ' s adaptive for the children to keep the states separate , so that they can keep the awareness of the abuse from their other selves , " said Dr. Putnam . " That way the feelings and memories don ' t flood them while they are at school , for instance . " <> <> Universal Phenomenon // The switches that patients with multiple personality go through are a special case of a universal phenomenon , according to an article by Dr. Putnam in the current issue of Dissociation , a journal devoted to multiple personality and related disorders . Anyone who goes from one extreme emotional state to another undergoes major biological shifts akin to those observed in those with multiple personality , according to Dr. Putnam . They are no different from the plunges into extreme emotion seen , for instance , in patients who go from depression to a manic state , or in someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the switches are harder to catch in other disorders ; they ' re more random , " said Dr. Putnam . " But some multiples can switch six times in an hour . They ' re a better laboratory for study. " // Through studying such patients , Dr. Braun believes , wider medical applications may be discovered . He points , for instance , to one patient who had a blood pressure of 150/110 when one personality was in control , and a pressure of only 90/60 when another personality took over. // " They can teach us much about the mechanisms by which we shift from one state of consciousness to another , " Dr. Putnam said . " Most of psychiatry deals with helping people shift from one unpleasant state to another , more pleasant one. " //
