students , who were often in over their heads . When it 's all going to hell , he used to say , just do one thing at a time . The plane sank slowly , the altimeter needle swinging counterclockwisewith about the speed of an elevator indicator . So they had all day . Go down slow and you have an easy transition at the bottom . Go down too fast and . . . As she sat there she continued to blink and flex her left arm . Does n't feel like anything 's broken , just numb . Maybe the world 's most colorful bruise on my shoulder , some orange-and-purple splotch that will be the envy of every tattooedmotorcyclist north of Juarez . She was hurting now . As the numbness wore off she was hurting . Her face felt like someone had used a steak hammer on it . Like she had slid down the sidewalk on her cheekbone for a couple hundred yards . " Come right about fifteen degrees or so and you 'll be lined up , " Toad said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rita , but I think we should try for a wire . " He reached up with his left hand and pulled the handle to drop the tailhook . " Just keep it lined up and descending wings level and we 'll be in fat city . " " Fuel ? How 's our fuel ? " " About ten grand or so . Just a little heavy . Let 's dump the fuel in the wings . " Rita reached with her left hand , up there under that blown-out quarter panel , for the dump switch on the fuel management panel . " I ca n't get it , " she said finally . " I 'll get it . " Toad leaned across and hunted until he had the proper switch . " Landing checklist . " " Okay , you got three down and locked , flaps and slats out , stab shifted , boards ? " She put them out and added some power . It took a while to get the plane stabilized on speed again . " Pop-up ? " Toad murmured when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you check the flaperon pop-up ? " The switch was on her left console . She had to lower her head and look as she fumbled with numb fingers . " Watch your wings , " Toad warned . She brought the wings back to level . " Screw the pop-up , " Toad announced , figuring that she just could n't ascertain the switch position . " It 's probably still on . Check the brakes . " This also took some doing . She had to lift both feet free of the deck where her heels rested and place the halls of her feet on topp201of the rudder pedals , then push . She had never before realized what a strain that put on her stomach muscles . She was weak as a kitten . She struggled and got her feet arranged and pushed hard . They met resistance . " Brakes okay . " She would have to do this again on the runway if the hook skipped over the short-field arrestinggear or she landed long . For now she let her feet slide down the pedals until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mask . " She gagged . " Get my mask off ! " Toad got her right fitting released just in time . She retched and the vomit poured down over her chest . Seeing Rita vomit and smelling that smell , Toad felt his own stomach turn over . He choked it back and helped her hold the plane level until she stopped heaving . " Okay , " she said when she finally got her mask back on , " check your harness lock and we 're ready to do it . " She took her hand off the stick and locked the harness lever on the forward right corner of the ejection seat . " Oh , poo , " Toad said . She glanced his way . He was reconnectinghis Koch fittings . " Sort of forgot to strap myself back in , " he explained . She ran her seat up as far as she could and yet still reach the rudder pedals . This put her face a little higher out of the wind , and in seconds she could see better , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still clogged with blood . " You 're coming down nicely , passing six thousand MSL , eighteenhundred above the ground . Let 's keep this sink rate and we 'll do okay . Come left a couple degrees , though . " She complied . " A little more . And gim me just a smidgen more power . " When she squinted and blinked a few more times , she could make out the runway . There was a little crosswind and Toad had her aimed off to the left slightly to compensate . The approach seemed to take forever , perhaps because she was hurting and perhaps because she was unsure if she could handle it at the bottom . She would just have to wait and see , but it was difficult waiting when she was so cold , and growing colder . She let the plane descend without throttle corrections , without wiggling the stick or trying to sweeten her lineup . With three hundred feet still to go on the radar altimeter , she made a heading correction . She was going to have trouble judging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that . She could do it , shep202decided . There was the meatball on the Optical Landing System . She began to fly it , working mightily to move the throttles . Still coming down , on speed , lined up , across the threshold . Now ! Throttles back a-little and nose just so , right rudder and left stick to straighten her out . . . oh yes ! The mainmounts kissed the concrete . The pilot used the stick to hold the nose wheel off as she smoothly closed the throttles . She had no more than got the enginesto idle when she felt the rapid deceleration as the tailhook engaged the short-field arresting gear . The nose slammed down . As the plane was jerked to a rapid stop , she applied the brakes . She got the flap handle forward with her left hand , but knew she would n't be able to tug hard enough to pull the parking brake handleout . Toggling the harness lock release by her right thigh , she got enough freedom to reach it with her right . Toad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fire truck came roaring up and screeched to a halt with firemen tumbling off . Canopy open , Rita checked that the flaps and slats were in . Her left shoulder was aching badly now and it was difficult to make her fingers do as she wished . One of the firemen ran out from the wheel well and made a cutting motion across his throat . He had inserted the safety pins in the landing gear . Both throttles around the horn to cutoff , engine-fuel master switches off as the RPMs dropped . Then the generators dropped off the line with an audible click and everything in the cockpit went dead . Exhausted , she fumbled with the generator switches until they too were secured . It was very quiet . She got the mask loose and , using only her right hand , pried the helmet off . The compressor blades tinkled steadily , gently , as the wind kept them turning , like a mobile on the porch of your grandmother 's house when you returned after a long absence . A man was standing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drew back in horror . " A bird , " she croaked . She heard Toad give a disgusted exclamation . " Wipe it off her , man ! It 's just bird guts . It ai n't her brains ! " They were loading Rita into an ambulance and the crash crew was filling out paperwork when a gray navy sedan screeched to a halt near the fire truck . Jake Grafton jumped out and strode towardp203Toad as white smoke wafted from the auto 's engine compartment . " Looks like you were in a hurry , " Toad said , and managed a grin . He was sitting , leaning back against the nose wheel , too drained to even stand . He felt as if he had just finished a ten-mile run . The crash chief tossed the captain a salute and he returned it even though he was n't wearing a hat . He obviously had other things on his mind . " How 's Rita ? " " Gon na be okay , I think . When they looked at her they thought she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of it cleaned off . Never saw so much shit . Must have been a damn big bird . They 're taking her over to the hospital for X rays and all . " Jake Grafton deflated visibly . He wiped his forehead with a hand , and then wiped his hand on his trousers , leaving a wet stain . " How come you did n't answer me on the damned radio ? I about had heart failure when you started doing whifferdills . " " I 'm sorry , sir . I disconnected my plugs and got a little unstrappedso I could reach over and fly the plane . Rita was sorta out of it there for a little while . " Jake climbed the pilot 's ladder and surveyed the cockpit . He examined the hole left in the plexiglas quarter panel by the late buzzard or eagle or hawk . " She come around okay ? " " Came to and landed this thing like it was on rails . Real damn sweet , GAG . Never saw a better landing . " A sailor drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the plane and backed a tow bar toward the nose wheel . " Well , " said Jake Grafton as he made a quick inspection of the Athena antennas , all of which seemed to be firmly in place , " you better zip over to the hospital and let them check you over too . I got ta get this plane put someplace private . " " Uh , CAG , you 're still gon na let us fly the prototypes , are n't you ? I mean , it was n't like we tried to hit that bird or anything . " Jake looked at Toad , slightly surprised . " Oh , " he said , " you two are my crew . If the doctors say you can fly . Now get over to the hospital and find out . Better get cleaned up too . You look like you 've been cleaning chickens and the chickens won . " " Ycssir . You bet . But , uh , I do n't have a ride . Can I take your car ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird goo all over the seat . " Hep204glanced at the car . Smoke was still leaking out . It was junk . " Keys are in it . But be careful  --  it 's government property . " Amazingly enough , the car engine actually started after Toad ground on it awhile . Jake had driven about forty miles at full throttle , about a hundred miles per hour , so he shook his head in wonderwhen the transmission engaged with a thunk and Toad drove away trailing smoke.  |p205'The  base dispensary contained an emergency room , but no other hospital facilities . After Rita Moravia was cut out of her flight gear , cleaned up and examined by a doctor , she was taken to a hospital in Reno , seventy miles away . Toad Tarkington arrived at the dispensary as the ambulance was driving away . " Oh , Doctor , " the corpsman called when he saw Toad coming through the door , " here comes the other one . " The doctor was only a year or two out of med school , but he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " He gestured to an examining room . A corpsman followed them in and closed the door . " Strip to the skin , " the doctor said . " How do you feel ? " He grasped Toad 's wrist and glanced at his watch . " Okay , Doc . The pilot took the bird hit . I just got splattered . " " Did you become hypoxic , pass out , inhale any feathers or anything like that ? " " No , sir . I just peed my pants . " The doctor checked his watch again , then looked at Toad with raised eyebrows . " Not really , " Toad said , suddenly aware that he was no longer in the company of his peers . " Sorry . How 's Moravia ? " The doctor was still all business . " Blurred vision in her left eye ,  |p206some  bruises and cuts , nothing serious . But she 's an excellent candidate for a major-league infection . I gave her a large dose of penicillinand sent her to - the hospital in Reno for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're sure she 's okay . " " And her eye ? " " I think it 'll be okay . They 'll look at that in Reno . " The doctor spent the next five minutes examining Toad . He peed in a bottle and gave a blood sample . The corpsman gathered up his flight gear . Toad insisted it all be put in a duffel bag . He stood holding his flight suit , which already had a hen-house smell . " What am I going to do for clothes ? " " Got any money ? " He dug his wallet from the chest pocket . " Fifty-three dollars . " The doctor added fifty dollars of his own money to Toad 's fortuneand sent the corpsman to the exchange for underwear , trousers , shirt , and tennis shoes . " Should be open until nineteen hundred hours . You can make it if you hurry . " Toad gave the enlisted man his sizes and expressed a few opinions about color and style . The corpsman flashed Toad a wicked grin as he headed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor into loaning him one of the navy sedans belonging to the dispensary . He was on his way to the parking lot in his new duds when he met Jake Grafton coming in . " You okay ? " the captain said . " Yessir . Just fine . Thought I 'd grab a little liberty . " Toad gave Jake back the keys to the sedan he had used to get to the dispensary , and displayed the keys to his borrowed vehicle . " I think your car 's had it . Want to come with me ? " " Where you going ? " " Reno . That 's where they took Rita . " He told Jake what the doctor had said . Jake begged off . He still had security arrangements and phone calls to make . " Call me from the hospital and tell me how she is . I 'll be at the BOQ . Leave a message at the desk if I 'm not there . " Jake watched Toad drive away toward the main gate , then went into the dispensary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left eye . She needed two great eyes to fly . Better than the doctor or even Toad , Jake Grafton knew what flying meant to Lieutenant Rita Moravia , U.S. Naval Aviator.  |p207They  had her in a semi-private room with a beautiful white-haired lady who was fast asleep . Toad spent ten minutes talking to the floor nurse and the internist before he went in . " They say you 're gon na be okay , " he told Rita with a grin . She had a patch over her left eye . Scratches and small cuts were visible on her cheek . She raised a finger to her lips . " Mrs. Douglas went to sleep a few minutes ago , " she whispered . Toad stood at the end of the bed glancing uneasily at the shiny , stark hospital equipment . Just being in a hospital made his leg ache . " Here , " she said , still whispering , " pull this chair over and sit down . Have you had any dinner ? " It was almost 10 P.M. " Uh-uh . How you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of the seat . She shrugged . " Thanks for saving my bacon . " He waved it away . " What 's wrong with her ? " he asked , glancing at the sleeping Mrs. Douglas . " Broken hip . She fell in her kitchen this morning . They 're going to pin it tomorrow evening . She 's been in a lot of pain today . " Toad nodded vaguely and examined the sheets that covered Rita . Hospital sheets always looked so perfect , even with a body between them . Her hair was a mess . They had cleaned it and made no attempt to pretty it up . That 's what 's wrong with hospitals  --  yourdignity is left at the front door on the way in . " That shirt you 're wearing is the most horrid garment I have  --  What are those colors ? Chartreuse and mauve ? " " Beats me , " Toad muttered , glancing at his torso with distaste . " One of the corpsmen picked it out at the exchange . He thought I would cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dashing is not the word I would use . " They sat for a while , each trying to think of something to say . " Guess your helmet visor saved your eyes , " he said at last . " Cushioned the impact . " " It 's amazing , when you stop to think about it . I thought about it all the way over here in the ambulance . The ambulance only goes ten miles over the speed limit , so everything on the road passes it . Lights flashing , and everyone whizzing by . So I had plenty of time to think about the odds . It 's amazing . " " What is ? " " How with the whole wide sky to fly in , all those thousands ofp208square miles , that bird and I tried to fly in exactly the same little piece of it . A foot further left , that bird would have missed the cockpit , a foot to the right and it would have hit the nose , a foot higher  --  " " Life 's like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is that what combat is like ? " " I would n't know . " " Were n't you and Captain Grafton  --  over the Med ? " Toad shrugged and slid further back into the chair . He crossed his leg with the pin in it over the good one and massaged it gently . " One flight . A couple minutes of being scared stiff and too busy to even sweat it . That was n't combat . Combat is day in and day out knowing they 're going to be shooting and being scared before you go and going anyway . I 've never done that . Hope I never have to . " He grinned wryly and cocked his head to better match the angle of hers against the pillow . " I 'm a peacetime drugstore cowboy . Did n't you know ? Make love not war . " " The Silver Star fooled me . " " Medals do n't mean shit . Over the Med CAG had the guts and determination , enough for him and me both with a lot left over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were hopelessly outclassed  --  at least that 's what I kept telling myself then . Still tell myself that on nights when I wake up thinking about it . I 'm even beginning to believe it . " She smoothed the sheets with her right hand . " How 's your left shoulder ? " " Just bruised . Hurts now . If this eye clears up ... " " It will . " " Got some cuts on the eyeball . Lots of bird flesh and even the stem of a little feather . " " It 'll be okay . " " I suppose . " " You 'll fly again . Just wait and see . You 're too good to stay on the ground . A person with your talent belongs in a cockpit . " " Ummm . " He put his feet on the floor , leaned forward and captured a hand . " Listen , Rita  --  Ginger  --  I know how you feel . The fickle finger of fate just reached out and zinged you a little one and remindedyou that you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know all this  --  you 've got to live every day the best you can , put the throttlesagainst the stops and fly . Flying is what it 's all about . Andp209when that final flight comes , that last day , as come it will , then look the Man straight in the eye and tell him it 's been a hell of a great ride . And thank him . That 's the way you have to live it . That 's the only way it can be done . " She took her hand from his and touched his cheek . " Get a good night 's sleep . Get well . You got a lot of flying left to do . " He stood . " I 'll look in on you tomorrow afternoon . Hang tough . " " Thanks for coming by . " He paused at the door and winked . " We fly together . Re-member ? " " Kiss me , lover . " He glanced at Mrs. Douglas . Her eyes were closed and she seemed to be asleep . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was 1 P.M. the next day when Luis Camacho pulled into his driveway in Silver Spring and let himself into his house . His wife was at work and his son was in school . The house felt strange on a weekday with both of them gone . He walked slowly through the downstairs , looking it over , listening to the refrigerator hum , lookingout the windows . He found his leather driving gloves in the hall closet , the pigskin ones his parents had given him two Christmases ago that he never wore because they were too nice . The batteries in the flashlight stowed in the catchall drawer in the kitchen still had some juice , amazingly enough . He tucked the light into his hip pocket and let himself out the kitchen door into the backyard . The wooden fence between his house and Albright 's had a gate with a rusty latch , no lock . The Labrador wanted to come with him , but he shooed it back and latched the gate behind him . He opened his packet of lock picks on Harlan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , trying to decide . It had been a while . Let 's see , the lock is a Yale . Opening it took ten minutes . The Lab finally quit whining next door . Probably he went back to his favorite spot in the sun and lay down . Camacho was beginning to think he was n't going to get this lock when it clicked . Albright had no fancy alarms , or none that Camacho had ever seen . Service manager at a local garage , he could n't afford the visibilitythat a Dort Knox security system would give him . But nop210doubt he had some little doodads here and there to let him know if he had any unwanted visitors . Luis Camacho stood in the door and carefully examined the interior . It looked precisely as he remembered it , exactly the way he had seen it for years . He stepped inside , eased the door shut and listened . Albright 's house was similar to his , one of four variations on the same basic floor plan the tract builder had used in half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustments , most of the differences were in the front facades . As he stood there the faint hum of the refrigerator shut off . Albright'sfridge was quieter than his . Probably newer too . He closed his eyes and concentrated , trying to shut out the faint sound of a car passing on the side street . Only a few creaks and groans as the house continued to warm in the early afternoon sun . He moved slowly through the kitchen and into the family room . A bachelor , Albright spent his evenings here , watching TV or reading . Camacho moved slowly , checking the walls and looking behindpictures  --  O'Keeffe prints  --  and tugging at the carpet edges . He inspected the books in the built-in bookcase , then randomly removed a few and checked the integrity of the wall behind by rapping with a knuckle . He did n't know what he hoped to find , but he would recognize it when he saw it . If there was anything to find , which was doubtful . The garage was next , then the basement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover the unpainted cinder blocks . Damp . Only two naked bulbs overhead , plus the one on the stairs . He glanced at the accumulated junk and the layers of dust and grime , and decided Albright cleaned his basement on the same schedule used by every other bachelor who owned one  --  never . There were some tools piled carelessly in one corner : a drill , a saber saw , a hammer , a box of hand tools . They were covered with the same thickness of dirt that covered everything else . Some cans of paint that looked like they had never been opened . Perhaps he had had a fit of enthusiasm which had waned on the way home from the hardware store . Camacho went back upstairs , consciously remindinghimself to flip off the light switch at the head of the stairs . He stopped dead in the kitchen . He turned and went back to the basement door . He opened it . Light switch on . What was that ? Was it a noise ? Lights off . Yes , there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half second or so . He repeated the procedure . He was n't imagining things . He could hear something . In the slanted ceiling of the stairway , down about three feet from the bulb , was a dusty screen . Several of the strands had been pushed aside , perhaps by a careless jab from a broom handle , leaving a hole . He flipped the light several more times . He could just barely hear it , the most minute of noises , hard to recognize . The screen was held on with four screws . Bare metal could be seen on the screw slots . When he got them out and lowered the screen he could see the camera lens . Rubber padding held on with rubber bands covered the camera body . A wire led to it . He stood on the stairs and examined it with his flashlight , then reached up and removed the camera , excess wire following along . The wire was connected to a gadget on top with a small alligator clip . With the stairwell light off , he unclipped it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rubber padding with gloves on was difficult , so he took them off . The gadget on top was some kind of an electromagnetic doohickey with a lever . When the current was turned on by flippingthe light switch , the magnet was energized and caused this steel pin to push the camera shutter button , tripping the shutter . When the current ceased , a spring reset the lever , which released the shutter button and allowed the film to be automatically advancedby the camera . It was a nice camera , a Canon . The little window said that it was on its ninth exposure . How many times had he turned that light on and off . He tried to count them . Six . No , five . So the film counter should be on four . He opened the camera and removed the film , then pulled the celluloid completely from its cartridge and held it up to the window . Rewinding the film back onto the cartridge was a chore , but he managed , and after wiping the cartridge carefully , he reinstalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the camera and wrapped it carefully . Working by feel with the overhead stair light off , he returned the device to its hole and screwed the screen back on . He flipped the light switch three times and was rewarded each time with that faint noise . There were three bedrooms upstairs , exactly the same floor plan here as in his house next door , but only two of them were furnished . The largest was obviously lived in , but the middle-sizedp212room was ready for a guest . Luis Camacho tried to remember if Harlan Albright had ever had an overnight guest that he knew about . No . He checked the carpet . Albright might have some kind of pressuredevice under there , or perhaps heat-sensitive paper . Nope . Another camera ? Apparently not . There was a little trapdoor in the hall ceiling that led to the unfinished attic . An upholstered chair sat just inside the guest bedroom . He put his nose almost to the seat and scrutinized it carefully . Yes , a few smudges of dirt were visible . Luis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes off and stood on it . He eased the door up . It was dark up there . A few flakes of dust drifted down . He stood on tiptoe and used the flash . He felt between the joists . Several items . One was a soft leather baglike thing , a zippered pistol rug . The other was a large , heavy metal toolbox that just fit through the trapdoor . He almost dropped the toolbox getting it down . The pistol rug contained a Ruger .22 autopistol with black plasticgrips and a partially full box of Remington ammunition . Bluing was worn off the pistol in places . The front sight and its sleeve were amputated , and threads were machined into the outside of the barrel to take the silencer , which was also in the rug . This was strictly a close-range weapon : with no front sight , it would be useless at any distance . He sniffed the barrel of the pistol . Cleaned since last use . He pushed the catch and the magazine dropped out of the grip into his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it clicked . No doubt the cleaning rod and patches and gun oil were up there in the joists somewhere . He replaced the items in the rug and zipped it closed . The toolbox was n't locked . Neatly packed in and padded to preventdamage were fuses , a roll of wire and a two-channel Futaba radio transmitter for radio-controlled models . Lots of servos , ten of them . A little bag containing crystals to change the frequency of the transmitter . Four miniature radio receivers , also made by Futaba . A bunch of nickel-cadmium batteries and a charging unit . Four six-cell batteries wrapped with black plastic . There was even a manual alarm clock . But the piece de resistance , the item that impressed Luis Camacho , was a radio receiver with a frequency-adjustment knob , volume knob , earpiece and spike meter . ' l'his device would allowp213the careful craftsman to check for possible radio interference in the area in which he intended to do his bit to improve the human species , before he armed his own device . Better safe than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kit . Everything recommended by Gentleman 's Quarterly for the well-heeled professional bomber was in there , including a case containing a set of jeweler 's screwdrivers and wrenches . Camacho repacked the items carefully , trying to put everything back exactly as he found it . After much straining he got the toolbox back through the trapdoor into the attic . He checked carefully in the joists as far as he could reach and see , then replaced the pistol rug . He was meticulous in restoring everything to its proper place , wiping a few flecks of dust from the chair arms and retrieving a larger piece from the carpet . When he had given everything a last look , he went down to the kitchen and seated himself at the table . Where was the plastique ? It had to be here someplace . Using his flashlight , he descended again to the basement and examined the paint cans . He hefted them , shook them gently . They contained something , but it probably was n't paint . Oh well . He locked the kitchen door behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard . Standing in his own kitchen with a pot of coffee dripping through the filter , he thought about Albright 's treasure as he maneuvereda cup under the black coffee basket to fill it . With the Pyrex pot back in place , he sipped on the hot liquid as he dialed the phone . After talking to three people , he was connected with the man he wanted , an explosives expert . " Well , the material 's ability to resist the effects of heat and cold and humidity depends on just what kind of stuff it is . Semtex is a brand real popular right now , made in Czechoslovakia . Heat wo n't do it any good , but if the heat is not too severe or prolonged , it should n't take much of its punch away . " " How about storage in an uninsulated attic ? " " Here , in this climate ? " " Yes . " " Not recommended . Best would be a place slightly below room temperature , a place where the temp stays pretty constant . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wine cellar . " " Sure . "  |p214Camacho  finished the cup of coffee , dumped the rest of the pot down the sink and turned off the coffee maker . He wiped the area with a dishrag and threw the wet grounds into the garbage . He did n't want his wife noticing he had been there . It was three o'clock when he locked the front door and drove away . At about the same instant that Luis Camacho was starting his car to return to his office , Toad Tarkington was parking at the Reno hospital . When he arrived in the room , Rita was sitting in a chair talking with Mrs. Douglas , her roommate . After the introductions Toad pulled up the other chair , a molded plastic job made for a smaller bottom than his . " When are they going to let you go ? " he asked as he tried to arrange himself comfortably . " Probably tomorrow . The doctor will be around in an hour or so . " " Did you get a good night 's sleep ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We had a series of little naps , did n't we ? " " We did . " Mrs. Douglas had a delicate voice . " I do n't sleep much anymore anyway . " She bit on her lower lip . " Perhaps we should go for a little walk , " Rita suggested . She rose and made sure her robe belt was firmly tied . " We 'll be back in a little bit , Mrs. Douglas . " " Okay , dear . " Out in the hall Toad said , " I see you fixed your hair . " " Was n't it a fright ? A hospital volunteer helped me this morning . She said it would help how I felt , and she was right . " She walked slowly in her slippers , her hands in her pockets . " Poor Mrs. Douglas . Here I 've been so concerned about my little half-acre and her two daughters came in this morning and told her she has to go to a nursing home . She 's very upset . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're afraid she 'll fall again with no one there , and the daughters work , with families of their own . " Toad made a sympathetic noise . He had never given the problems of elderly people much thought . He really did n't want to do so now either . Rita paused for a drink from a water fountain , then turned hack toward her room . " I just wanted you to know the situation . Now we 'll go back and cheer her up . "  |p215Toad  put his hand on her arm . " Whoa , lady . Let 's run that one by again . Just how are we going to do that ? " " You cheered me up last night . You make me feel good just being around you . You can do the same with her . " Toad looked up and down the hall for help , someone or something to rescue him . No such luck . He looked again at Rita , who was absorbing every twitch of his facial muscles . " Women my own age I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up a smattering of experience here and there with the gentle sex , but eighty-yearoldladies with busted hips are completely out of  --  " " You can do it , " Rita said with simple , matter-of-fact faith , and grasping his hand , she led him back along the hallway . In the room she nudged him toward the chair near Mrs. Douglas . He started to give Rita a glare , but when he realized Mrs. Douglas was watching him , he changed it to a smile . It came out as a silly , nervous smile . Women ! If they did n't screw there 'd be a bounty on ' em . " Rita says you 're facing some very significant changes in your life . " The elderly woman nodded . She was still chewing on her lip . At that moment Toad forgot Rita and saw before him his own mother as she would be in a few years . " Pretty damned tough , " he said , meaning it . " My life now is my garden , the roses and bulbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do my housework and spend my time watching the cycle of life in my garden . I was n't ready to give that up . " I see . " " I have most of my things planted now . The bulbs have been up for a month or so . They were so pretty this spring . " " I do n't suppose any of us are ever ready to give up something we love . " " I suppose not . But I had hoped that I would n't have to . My husband  --  he died fifteen years ago with a heart attack while he was playing golf . He so loved golf . I was hoping that someday in my garden I . . . " She closed her eyes . When she opened them again Toad asked about her garden . It was not large , he was told . Very small , in fact . But it was enough . That was one of life 's most important lessons , learning what was enough and what was too much . Understanding what was sufficient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sufficient changes as you actp216older . It 's one thing for a child , another for an adult , another thing still when you reach my age . I think as you age life gets simpler , more basic . " " I 'm curious , " said Toad Tarkington , feeling more than a little embarrassed . He shot a hot glance at Rita . " Do you pray much ? " " No . It 's too much like begging . The professional pray-ers alwayswant things they will never get , things they just ca n't have . Like peace on earth and conversion of the sinners and cures for all the sick . And to prove they really want all these things that can never be , they grovel and beg . " " At least they 're sincere , " Rita said . " Beggars always are , " Mrs. Douglas shot back . " That 's their one virtue . " Toad grinned . Mrs. Douglas appeared to be a fellow cynic , which he found quite agreeable . Perhaps the age difference does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked one more question . " What will heaven be like , do you think ? " " A garden . With roses and flowers of all kinds . My heaven will be that anyway . What yours will be , I do n't know . " Mrs. Douglas waggled a finger at him without lifting her hand from the bed . " You are two very nice young people , to spend time with an old woman to cheer her up . When are you going to marry ? " Toad laughed and stood . " You tell her , Mrs. Douglas . She absolutelyrefuses to become an honest woman . " He said his goodbyes and Rita followed him into the hall . " Thanks . That was n't so hard , was it ? " She had her arms folded across her chest . " Hang tough , Rita . If they let you take a hike tonight or tomorrow , give me a call at the BOQ . Captain Grafton or I will come get you and bring you some clothes . " She nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He paused . " What do you want from life , Rita ? What will be sufficient ? " She shook her head . He winked and walked away.  |p217In  an era when the average American male stood almost six feet tall , Secretary of Defense Royce Caplinger towered just five feet six inches in his custommadeshoes with two-inch heels . Perhaps understandably , his hero and role model was Douglas MacArthur , of whom he had written a biography ten years before . The critics had savaged it and the postVietnampublic had ignored it . Caplinger , said one wag , would have won MacArthur sainthood had the book been even half true . How deeply this experience hurt Caplinger only his family might have known . The world was allowed to see only the merciless efficiencyand detached intellect that had made him a millionaire by the time he was thirty and president and CEO of one of the twenty largest industrial companies in the nation when he was forty-two . Now worth in excess of a hundred million dollars , he was a man who believed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titanicegos in which he moved he saw himself as a giant and , to his credit , others saw him the same way . Rude and abrasive , Caplinger never forgot or forgave . He had never been accused of possessing a sense of humor . He won many more battles than he lost because he was right , often terrifically right , as his many enemies freely acknowledged . He often won when he was wrong too , because he could play major-league hard/ball with the best of them . Years ago his subordinates had labeled him " the cannibal , " whispering that he liked the taste of raw flesh . Caplinger had the brain of Caesar and the soul of a lizard , all housed in the body of a chimpanzee , or so one of his more daring victims had groused to Time magazine . This quote crossed Jake Grafton 's mind just now as he watched the secretary 's gaze dart back and forth across the faces of the men at the luncheon table as they were served pear halves in china dishes bearing the seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket . Jake was back in Washington for a week while the China Lake crowd fixed their A-6 , Rita Moravia recovered , and Samuel Dodgers tinkered with the Athena device . This was Jake 's first meal in the Secretary of the Navy 's dining/conference room , so today he was playing tourist and taking it all in . The room was spacious and paneled with dark wood , perhaps mahogany . Deep blue drapes dressed up the windows . A half dozen oil paintings of sailing ships and battles , with little spotlights to show them to advantage , were arranged strategically between the windows and doors . Gleaming brass bric-a-brac provided the accents . Sort of early New York Yacht Club , Jake decided , a nineteenth-centuryvision of a great place for railroad pirates and coal barons to socialize over whiskey with nautical small talk about spankers and jibs and their latest weekend sail to Newport . He would describe the room for Callie this evening . He sipped his sugarless iced tea and turned his attention to the conversation . In keeping with his temperament , Caplinger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress has ceased to exist as a viable legislative body since Watergate . They ca n't even manage to give senior leadersor the judiciary a pay raise without making a hash of it . - Without strong , capable leaders , Congress is a collection of mediocrities drifting ... " Jake used his knife to slice the fruit in his dish , two whole halves , to make it go further . Already he suspected this was n't going to be much of a meal . At the opposite end of the table from the Secretary of Defense sat today 's host , Secretary of the Navy George Ludlow . He was nibbling at pieces of pear he nicked off with his fork and listening to Caplinger . No doubt he was used to these monologues ; he had married Caplinger 's second daughter , a modestly pretty young woman with a smile that looked vacuous in news photos . JakeGrafton had never met her and probably never would.  | " ... five hundred thirty-five ants on a soapbox drifting down the Potomac , each of them thinking he 's steering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had heard that old saw before . Across the long table from Jake sat Tyler Henry , Under Secretaryof Defense for Acquisition Russell Queen , and the Chief of Naval Operations , Admiral Jerome Nathan Lanham . Lanham was a submariner , a nuke , with all the baggage that term implies : team player , risk minimizer , technocrat par excellencein the service of the nuclear genie . His patron saint was Hyman Rickover , the father of the nuclear navy , whose portrait hung in Lanham 's office . Like Rickover , Jerome Nathan Lanham was reputed to have little use for nonengineers . Just now he sat regarding Jake Grafton , A. B. in history , with raised eyebrows . Jake nodded politely and speared another tiny hunk of pear . The dish was half full of juice . He wondered if he should go after it with a spoon and surveyed the table to see if anyone else was . Nope . Well , hell . He used the spoon anyway , trying to be discreet , as Caplinger ruminated upon the current political situation in Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . . . wanted to hang Hirohito after the war , but MacArthur said no , which was genius . The Japanese would never have forgiven us . " " If we conquered Iran today , what would you do with Khomeini ? " Helmet Fritsche , seated to Jake 's right , asked the question of Caplinger , who grinned broadly . " Such a tiny hypothetical  --  he should have been a lawyer , " Ludlow muttered sotto voce as the others laughed . " Make Khomeini a martyr ? No . I 'd ensure he did n't get any older , but the autopsy  --  and there would be one  --  would read oldage . After the salad came small bowls of navy bean soup accompanied by some tasteless crackers . Even Caplinger thought they were insipid . " George , these crackers taste worse than some of my old predictions . " When the soup was gone , the steward filled coffee cups and whisked away the dishes , then retired . Jake watched incredulously . Apparently they had just had the entire meal . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on grub . " Well , Grafton , " Caplinger said , " will Athena work ? " " Yessir . It 's the biggest technical advance in naval aviation since I 've been in the navy . "  | " If it works "  --  the Secretary of Defense eyed Jake across the rim of his coffee cup  --  " it 'll be the biggest leap forward for the military since the invention of radar . The air force is going to want this technology yesterday . It 'll save their strategic bomber program . " Jake understood . The air force would be able to use much cheaper bombers than the B-2 , which they would never get any significant number of at a half billion dollars each . " I want it right now , " Admiral Lanham said . " These devices will make surface ships invisible to radar satellites and cruise missiles . The entire Soviet naval air arm will be obsolete . I want a crash program that puts Athena in the fleet right now , and damn the cost ! " Caplinger shifted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Will it work ? Can it be made to work ? " " Anything 's possible given enough time and money . " " How much ? " demanded Under SECDEF Russell Queen . In civilian life he had been president of a large accounting firm . White skin , banker 's hands , bald , Queen had long ago lost the battle of the bulge . He was a humorless man with thick glasses . Jake decidedit would require prodigious faith to believe Russell Queen had once been young or ever loved a woman . " How much do you think will be enough ? " Fritsche 's shoulders rose a quarter inch and fell . " Depends on how you go about it  --  how you structure the contract , how many units you buy annually , how big a risk you 're willing to take on unproven technology . We did n't test a full-up system . All we did was prove the concept , and we have some more work to do on that next week . We 're a long way from an operational system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How long ? " Helmut Fritsche took out a cigar and rolled it thoughtfully between his hands . He did n't reach for a match . " Two or three years  --  if you can make all the paper pushers keep hands off . Four or five if it 's business as usual . " Every head at the table bobbed its owner 's concurrence . " Humph , " snorted Caplinger , who sucked in a bushel of air and sent it down as far as it would go , then exhaled slowly . " I can try to put  --  maybe slip it under the stealth stuff  --  but . . . " His enthusiasmwould n't fill a thimble . Even the Secretary of Defense could n't control the legions of bureaucrats with rice howls to protect. " l'hev were too well armed with statutes and regulations andp221pet congressmen . " Russell , you 'll have to make this work , find some dollars in one of your little hidey-holes , keep it too small for anyone to get curious about . And no fucking memos . " Queen nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked , Jake thought , like a man staring into a dark abyss that he has been told to lower himself into . " I do n't think that 's the way to do it , " Ludlow said . " Admiral Lanham wants it now and the air force will too . We 're going to have to fund Athena as one of our highest-priority items . We 're going to have to throw money at it and hope the technology works . " " Do you agree , Admiral ? " " Yes , sir . I 'd rather have Athena than a whole lot of projects I can name , including the A-12 . " " We need them both , " Caplinger said . " So we 'll keep Athena in with the ATA and request funding for them both . " " What about Congress ? " Ludlow murmured . When no one replied , he expanded the question . " How will Athena be seen by the liberals dying to chop the defense budget ? Will they think it gives us such a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our capital budget ? Shrink the navy ? " To maintain a navy , worn-out , obsolete ships must be constantly replaced with new ones . New ships are expensive and require years to construct . A decision not to build as many as necessary to maintain current force levels was a decision to shrink the navy . Insufficient ships to fulfill continuing worldwide commitments forced planners to delay ship overhauls and keep sailors at sea for grotesquely long periods , which wore out ships prematurely and devastated enlisted retentionrates . It was a cruel downward spiral . This was the post-Vietnamnightmare from which the navy was just recovering . " No democracy will ever buy enough ships , " Jake Grafton said . " Not over the long haul . " " You 're saying we ca n't maintain a six-hundred-ship navy , " Lanham said , frowning . " We do n't have six hundred ships now , sir , and we 're not likely to ever get them , " Jake shot back , suddenly sure he did n't want Lanham to think he could be cowed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many ships . ' l'hat 's the argument , " said Ludlow . " Politicians never understand commitments , " Royce Caplinger said dryly , " perhaps because they make so many of them . Thep222federal deficit is totally out of control due to mandated increases in social program expenditures . They borrowed money and never asked if they could afford the interest . They approved treaties and never weighed the cost in defense expenditures . " The CNO made a gesture of frustration . " We have more practicalconcerns . The air force is facing institutional death . They gave up the close air support mission to the army a generation ago . The strategic bomber mission is on the ropes . All they have left is ICBMs  --  which the army could run  --  and tactical air and airlift . Their bases are fixed , vulnerable to ICBMs and political upheavals . The world is passing them by . They 're panicking . And they have a lot of friends . If they do n't get Athena and get it now . . . " " It 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Secretary of Defense , " Caplinger said , his voice hard . " I will take care of the air force . You people take care of the navy . " The heavy silence that followed was broken by Tyler Henry . " No one has mentioned the Minotaur . " All eyes turned to the vice admiral . An uncomfortable look crossed his face , as if he had just farted in church . " What about him ? " Caplinger asked . " He has n't gotten Athena yet , but the minute we start bringing defense contractors into the loop , he will . " Caplinger leaned forward . " Where will we be if he gives Athena to the Russians ? " Henry had recovered his composure . " We 'll have lost our advantage , " he said with a trace of irritation in his voice . " They outgun us two to one . We need the technological edge to stay in the game . " Caplinger got to his feet and reached for the jacket draped over the back of his chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to these people and get this Athena business on track . I want it in production as soon as possible . We 'll include it with the ATA in the budget . Black all the way . " He paused and surveyed the faces at the table . " The navy can develop this . Keep it under wraps . Security as tight as a miser 's money belt . Develop it for planes and ships . But the air force must be brought into this as soon as we have to start talking to Congress . This may kill the B-2 , but it 'll save the B-1 . " " But what about the billions we 're pouring into stealth planes now ? " Russell Queen the bean counter asked his boss . " Heck , Russell , this Athena gizmo may not work . Probablyp223wo n't . Sorry , Tyler , but after all ! A religious crackpot in a backyard workshop ? It 's too good to be true . Sounds like something Tom Clancy dreamed up after he had a bad pizza . " An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ERingback toward the admiral 's office , Jake remarked , " At lunch , Admiral , you said we need a technological edge to stay in the game . What if the game has changed ? " " You mean Gorbachev reforming the Kremlin , converting the commies ? Bull fucking shit . " " The Soviets packed up and pulled out of Afghanistan . They helped get the Cubans out of Angola . They 're relaxing their hold on Eastern Europe . They 're even talking to the Chinese . Something 's going on . " " So the sons of Uncle Joe Stalin have given up their goal of world domination ? The fucking thugs who murdered twenty millionof their own people ? My aching ass . That 's all big-lie propagandathat liberal half-wits want to believe . Twenty million men , women and children ! They make Adolf Hitler look like a weenie waver . We 'd better have the edge when the shit splatters , because we 'll never get a second chance . " " So you 're maintaining an open mind on the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose-screw Tarkington too long , Grafton . You 're beginning to sound like him . " Dunedin must have mentioned Tarkington to Henry , Jake surmised . He was sure Henry had never met the lieutenant . " But what if Royce Caplinger and the politicos in Congress think the game has changed ? " " Caplinger is n't a fool . " Two paces later Henry added , " Thinking politician ' is an oxymoron . " After Jake parted from the admiral he walked to the cafeteria , where he bought a packet of Nabs and washed them down with a half-pint of milk . Humans are unique animals , he reflected . What other species has man 's ability to see the world as he wants it to be , rather than as it actually is ? He could n't think of any . The worst of it is that this human trait deprives you of the ability to recognize reality when you see it . On this gloomy note his thoughts turned to Callie . " What d' ya think 's wrong with it ? " Camacho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luis ' car . It had a ragged ,  |p224sick  sound , most likely because Camacho had taken out one of the spark plugs and pounded the little arm against the core until there was no gap at all , then reinstalled it . " Sounds to me like you got a cylinder missing , but I 'm no mechanic , " Albright said , and made notations on the service form . " We 'll have a guy look at it this afternoon and give you a call . I ca n't give you an estimate or tell you how long it 'll take to fix until we find out what 's wrong . " " What neighborhood of finance are we talking here ? Checking , savings , or second mortgage ? " Albright grinned and slid the form across the counter for Camacho to sign . " We 'll call you . " " Well , poo . How about running me back downtown ? " The service manager glanced at the wall clock . " I get off for lunch in about thirty minutes . You wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showroom or get some coffee . " Albright was driving a new car with dealer plates . Camacho settledinto the passenger seat and fastened the seat belt as Albright pulled out into traffic . " Thought I ought a drop by and fill you in . Sally and I have to go to a church dinner tonight . The only thing wrong with my car is a bad spark plug . Do n't let your mechanical wizards screw me . " " So what 's happening ? " " We 've got a letter from Terry Franklin 's mother-in-law . She says he 's a spy and wants us to bust him . " Albright glanced at the FBI agent . " You must get letters like that all the time . " " We do . And we check them out . Which is precisely what we 're going to do with this one . Sometime toward the end of next week we 'll have to interview Franklin . Thought you ought to know . " " I appreciate that . And the search for the Minotaur ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe you already got it . Maybe Franklin is the Minotaur . " " Yeah . And I 'm Donald Trump . I just live like this because I think money is vulgar . Jesus , you know damn well that little shit does n't have the balls or the brains . " " I 've been thinking about it . " He coasted the car up to a stoplightand waited until it turned green . " It 's possible he could be hacking the codes from the computer , mailing them to the embassy , then waiting for us to pay him to copy the files . Maybe he'sp225slicker than anyone suspected . Maybe being a schlep is his idea of secondary cover . " " Seriously , I thought of that some time back . But I ca n't find a shred of evidence . And this stuff you 're getting  --  I thought you said it was good . " " Excellent . " " So the Minotaur knows quality . It 's not Franklin or any other computer clerk . It 's somebody so high they know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the world of espionage , need determines value . He spotted a Burger King and turned in . With the engine off , he leaned back in his seat and adjusted his testicles to a more comfortable position . " You 're stringing me along , Luis . " Camacho already had his door open , but he pulled it closed . " Say that again . " " I think you 're a lot closer to the Minotaur than you 're telling me . You may even know who he is . That leads me to some interestingspeculations . " Camacho had been expecting this , but now that it was here he still did n't know how to play it . " So I 'm a double agent . Is that it ? " Harlan Albright raised an eyebrow , then looked away . " Start the fucking car . Take me to the office . I do n't have time to sit around and shoot the shit with you over a greaseburger . " Albright turned the key . The engine caught . Two blocks later he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why bother ? You have never given me a list of the stuff you got from the Minotaur . Now today you give me this crap about Franklinbeing the Minotaur and I 'm supposed to go charging off like Inspector Clouseau . Why do n't you go back to Moscow and tell Gorby you screwed the pooch ? Mail me a postcard when you get to Siberia . I hear it 's lovely in the snow . " " I do n't know the file names . Even if I did , I do n't have the authority to give them to you . " " Go tell it to somebody who gives a shit . I do n't . " " What about Smoke Judy ? " " What about him ? " " What 's he up to ? " " He 's trying to peddle inside knowledge of defense contracts . So far without much success , as far as I can tell . Apparently he does n't think money is vulgar . "  | " Are the fraud people onto him ? IG or NIS ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service . " If somebody 's opened a file on him , I do n't know about it . " " Do n't turn him over to them . " " Why not ? " " Because I 'm asking you not to . " " Well , kiss my ass . You 're taking a big chance , asking a double agent for a favor . Stop up here at the corner . " They were going west on Constitution Avenue . " This is close enough . I need some air . " Albright pulled over to the curb and braked to a stop . " Do n't turn him over . " " Up yours . " " I was just trying to motivate you . You know I do n't doubt your loyalty . " " If I was a double agent we would have pulled in Terry Franklina long time ago and squeezed him for the name of every file thatyou do n't want me to know . He 'd sing like a canary . " " I know , " Albright replied as Camacho opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know shit . You do n't know how many anonymous fraud , waste and abuse hot lines there are over at the Pentagon . The damn numbers are posted everywhere . Do n't like your boss ? Nail him to the cross on your coffee break . Busybodies and prissy fat ladies are burning up the wires . Somebody could drop a dime on Judy any minute . Then I 'll be your fall guy , the double agent . " " Find the Minotaur . " " That mechanic screws me , I 'll break your nose . " Luis Camacho shut the door firmly and walked away . As he trudged through the tourists and secretaries on lunch break he tried to decide if he had handled it well or poorly . The lies were plausible , he concluded , but he was suspect . Peter Aleksandrovichwas nobody 's fool . And " schlep "  --  what an interesting word for a commie to use . Underestimating this man could be fatal . The new Amy Carol Grafton frowned at the peas on her plate . She glowered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat loaf and put it in her mouth , where she held it without chewing as she stared at the offending vegetables . " What 's the matter , Amy ? " Gallic asked  |p227Amy  Carol sat erect in her chair and tossed her black pageboy hair . " I do n't like vegetables . " " They 're good for you . You need to eat some of them . " Amy 's brand-new mom was the soul of reason . Jake Grafton took another sip of coffee and the last bite of his meat loaf . " I do n't like green food . " " Then eat your carrots , dear . " Callie smiled distractedly . If the child did n't eat her peas , what would be her vitamin count for vegetables today ? Callie had spent the past week researching diets for diabetics . Right now she was swamped with strange facts . " I do n't like orange stuff either . " " Amy , " said the new father with a glint in his eye , " I do n't care what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff on the table , so you 're going to eat it . Now start . " " She is n't my mom . And you 're not my dad . My parents are dead . You 're Callie and Jake . And I do n't like you , Jake , not one little bit . " " Fine . But you 're going to sit there until you finish those vegetablesand I say you can get up . " " Why ? " Her lower lip began to quiver and her brows knitted . Callie thought Amy looked so cute and helpless when she clouded up . Jake thought Callie had a lot to learn . " Because I said so . " Jake picked up the newspaper , opened it ostentatiously and hid behind it . Callie got up and went to the sink , rinsing dishes . Jake reached around the paper every so often for a sip of coffee . Their second meal with their new daughter . Another disaster . The youngster was trying to establish who 's in charge , Jake told his wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . He used precisely those words to the new mother last night , after the first , opening-day debacle at the dinner table , when the youngster was finally in bed , and had been told in no uncertain terms that he was a lout . Lout or not , " I am wearing the trousers , " he said with his right trigger finger pointed straight up , " and we are going to establish very early that I have the last say on junior-senior relations around here . Somebody has to be in charge and it 's not going to be an eleven-year-old . " " Just because you wear trousers , huh ? " " No . Because when I was growing up my father was the head ofp228his family , and I intend to be the head of mine . It 's a tried and true system with ancient tradition to commend it . We 're going to stick with it . " " You ca n't issue orders around here , Captain Grafton . Amy and I do n't wear uniforms . " She raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also off to a rocky start . Jake put down his newspaper and examined the vegetable situation . The child apparently had n't touched a pea or a carrot . She was staring fixedly at her plate with a sullen , defiant look . " How was school today ? " Jake asked . No answer . " I asked you a question , Amy . " " Okay . " " Tell me about your teachers . " " What do you want to know ? " " Their names , what subjects they teach , what they look like , whether you like them . That kind of stuff . " " Wellll , " Amy said , her gaze flicking across Jake 's face , " some of them are nice and some are n't . " And away she went on a fiveminuteexposition that covered the school day from opening to closing bell . Jake tossed in an occasional question when she paused for air . When she had exhausted the teacher subject , Jake asked , " What subjects do you think you 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the merits of math versus English , social studies versus science . This time when she ran down , Jake asked if she had any homework . " Some math problems . " " Need any help with them ? " " The division ones , " she said tentatively . " Eat some of those peas and carrots and we 'll clear the table and work on the problems . " " How many do I have to eat ? " " Two spoonfuls of each . " She made a face and did as she was bid . As he carried the dishes to the sink , Jake asked , " Just what vegetables do you like ? " " Not any of them . " " Well , do you have some that you do n't hate as much as oth-ers ? " " Corn . Corn is okay . But not the creamed kind . " She squirmed . " And I like lima beans . "  | " No kidding ? So do I. Maybe we can have some tomorrow night . How about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk that served as a paper catchall , looking once again at the diet book . She turned to Jake and nodded . She had tears in her eyes . He winked at her . " Amy , better get your school books . And , Callie , do n't we have some sugarless dessert around here for little girls who eat their din-ner ? "  |p230A  woman from the garage called at 10 A.M. and said his car was ready : $119.26 . Camacho told her he would stop by after work . She hung up before he could even ask what the problem had been . Dreyfus gave him a ride and dropped him in front of the showroom . The new cars gleamed shamelessly and flashed their chrome with wanton abandon as he walked by . Light , easy-listening music sounded everywhere . Two salesmen asked if he needed help . He paid for the repairs at a window where a harried young woman juggled two phones as she pounded numbers into a computer . He surrendered his driver 's license for her scrutiny before she asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo , she copied the number onto the check and slid it back at him . His six-year-old car sat amid twenty or so others of its vintage on a gravel lot out back . Dingy and coated with road grime , it had n't seen wax since . . . not since he gave his son twenty dollars that Saturday two years ago and the kid let the wax dry like paint all over the car before he tried to wipe it off . Camacho unlocked the door , rolled down the windows and tossed the yellow card dangling from the rearview-mirror bracketp231onto the floor . The car started readily enough and ran sweetly . He examined the invoice . Diagnostic test . Defective spark plug . Defectivelead cable ? Ouch  --  they got him there ! Labor . How is it a garage can charge $55 per hour for a mechanic 's time ? About two miles from the garage was a shopping center with a large parking lot , most of which was empty except for light poles and a couple of cars that looked as if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had two flat tires . He parked near it and got his jack from the trunk . The rear end went up first . He had an old army blanket in the trunk and spread it under the car so he would n't get too filthy . With coat and tie on the back seat , flashlight in hand , Luis Camacho slid gingerly under the car . He knew exactly what he was looking for , but it might be hard to spot . Five minutes later he stood beside the car and scratched his head . If Albright had put a bomb in this thing , where was it ? After a thorough scrutiny of the engine compartment and the trunk cavity , he attacked the door panels and rockers with a Phillips-headscrewdriver . How many possible places were there ? The backseats ? Could he get them loose and look under them ? The odds of a bomb being there were small , of course , but there was a chance . Just how big a chance , Camacho did n't know . Peter AleksandrovichChistyakov was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had frightened Camacho , coming as it did from a man who owned an assassin 's pistol and had enough gadgets in his attic to blow up half the cops in Washington . To assess just how likely it was that good of Harlan Albright had decided to eliminate a possible threat , one would need to know just what it was that was being threatened . How many other agents was he running ? What kind of information were they getting ? Of course , Albright could slip a bomb under the car any night while Camacho snored in his own bed . Risky , but feasible . But perhaps he had planted a bomb with a radio-actuated device as insurance , hoping he would n't have to use it , but with it already in place should the need arise . A careful man might do something like that , right ? Apparently Albright was a careful man . The bomb was in the driver 's door , behind the panel , below the window glass when it was rolled completely down . It had been carefully taped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appeared to contain a couple pounds of plastiyue.  |p232One  fuse stuck out of the oblong mass . A wire ran from the fuse to a servo and from the servo to a six-volt battery . A little receiver was wired to the servo and four AA batteries were hooked up to power it . A tiny wire attached to the receiver was routed all along the inside of the door . It was a simple , radio-actuated bomb . Simple and effective . Luis Camacho pulled the fuse from the bomb and used a penknifeto cut the wire . The plastique and the rest of it he left in place . Sweating in spite of the fifty-five-degree weather and fifteenmile-per-hourwind , he replaced the jack in the trunk . The door panel he put in the back seat . Had he figured it right ? Was this merely insurance ? Or had **26;16283;TOOLONG decided to push the button ? Standing there beside the car , he looked around slowly , checking . A lot of good that will do you , Luis . Cursing under his breath , he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little hardware store in the shopping center , right between a gourmet food store and a factory fabric outlet . Inside Camacho bought a small flashlight , a coil of insulated wire , and some black electrician 's tape . Out in the parking lot he used the knife and screwdriver to disassemblethe flashlight . The bulb he mounted with tape on a hole he carved in the door panel . Fifteen minutes later he had the last screw back in place and the crank for the window reinstalled . There ! Now if Albright pushes the button , instead of a big bang , this flashlight bulb will illuminate and burn continuously until that six-volt ni-cad battery in the door is completely discharged . Assuminghe sees the illuminated bulb  --  and the unsoldered wire connectionsdo n't vibrate loose  --  our saintly hero Luis Camacho , FBI ace spy catcher , will then have time to bend over and kiss his ass goodbyebefore the bullets from the silenced Ruger .22 send him to a kinder , more gentle world . What more could any man ask ? He sat behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got out of the car and walked back across the parking lot to the gourmet store , the Bon Vivant . The place smelled of herb and flower leaf sachets . The clerk , a woman in her forties with long , ironed hair , was too engrossed in a book to even nod at him . He wandered through the aisles , looking at cans and jars of stuff imported from all over the world . Nothing from Iowa here . If it'sp233green or purple and packed in a jar from Europe or the Orient , with an outrageous price , you know it 's got to be good . He selected a jar of blue French jam , " Bilberry " the label said , paid $4.32 plus tax to the refugee from Berkeley , and walked back across the empty , gray parking lot to his car . The flight surgeon at the China Lake dispensary pronounced Rita fit to fly on Friday afternoon . Jake Grafton spent Saturday in the hangar with Samuel Dodgers and Helmut Fritsche going over the computer program and modifications to Athena that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed with Dodgers ' technological achievement and even more disenchanted with Dodgers the human being . Like every fanatic , Dodgers thought in absolutes which left no room for tolerance or dissent . On technical matters his mind was open , inquiring , incisive , leaping to new insightsregardless of where the leap took him or the hoary precedentsshattered by the jump . On everything else , however , every aspect of the human condition , Dodgers was bigoted , voluble , and usually wrong . It was as if his maker had increased his scientific talents at the expense of all the others , thus creating a mean little genius who viewed the world as a collection of wicked conspiracies hatched by evil , godless agents of the devil . His opinion of most of his less gifted fellow men was equally bleak . And he did believe in the devil . He waxed long and loud on Satan and his works whenever he had a half minute that was not devoted to the task at hand . How Fritsche tolerated these diatribes Jake could n't fathom . He found himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside of the building when he had had all he could stomach . " How can you listen to that asshole without choking him ? " Jake asked during a brief interlude when nature called Dodgers to the head . " Whatszat ? " Fritsche asked , raising his eyebrows curiously . " These endless scatterbrained rantings , " Jake explained patiently . " In the last hour he 's slandered every racial and ethnic group on the planet and denounced everyone in government as thieves and liars and worse . How can you listen to this ? " " Oh . That . I never listen . I 'm too busy thinking about Athena . I shut out all that other stuff . " " Wish I could . " ' ' Ilmmm , " said Fritsche , obviously not paying much attention to lake either.  | " If he does n't cool it some , I 'll probably strangle him by dinnertime . Better learn all you can this afternoon . " " Uh-huh , " said Fritsche , who was bending and reexamining the cooling unit that kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miniaturization and engineering . " How this man made this in a backyard workshop just boggles the mind . Look here , the craftsmanship of these welds , the way he polished this forging with acid to mimimize heat loss . Look here ! See how he built this to maximize cooling and shorten the wire runs . And he did n't even use a computer to design this ! " " Instinct . The troll 's a genius , " Jake Grafton admitted reluctantly . The other shoe fell on Sunday morning , when Jake received a telephone call from Washington . George Ludlow was on the other end of the wire . " Royce Caplinger 's flying out to see you this afternoon . He 's bringing Senator Hiram Duquesne with him . Each of them will have an aide along . Get them rooms in the BOQ . " " Jesus , Mr. Secretary . This project 's got a security lid tight as a virgin 's twat . We do n't need any godda  --  any senator  --  " " Duquesne had to be told , Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee . I 'm not asking your opinion . I 'm informing you . Got it ? " " Yessir . I got it . Have you also informed Admiral Dunedin ? " " Yes . " The connection broke . Jake cradled the phone . He soon learned there were but two empty rooms in the BOQ , so he sent the two junior members of his party to a motel off base . Those two were Toad and Rita , neither of whom looked very distressed when they tossed their bags into the back of a navy station wagon and drove away . He wore his only clean white uniform and was standing in the sun in front of the terminal when the T-39 taxied up and Royce Caplinger stepped out . The CO of the base was standing beside Jake . Both officers saluted smartly . They also snapped a salute to Senator Duquesne , who was dressed in slacks and pullover shirt and looked like he had had a couple snorts on the trip . As Duquesneblinked mightily at the bright light , a woman descended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Caplinger said her name . " Ms. DeCrescentis . She 's a guest of Senator Duquesne . " " Consolidated Technologies . She 's a vice president , is n't she ? "  | " Yep , " said Duquesne . " Good to see you again , Captain , " he said in a tone that implied just the opposite . " Hitchhiking today , Ms. DeCrescentis ? " " She 's here to take the tour with us , " Caplinger said . " Could I talk to you privately for a moment , " Jake said , not a question , and walked away from the group . Twenty paces or so away Jake turned around . Caplinger was right behind . Jake let him have it : " Ludlow said you were coming for a briefing with a senator , even though this project is classified to the hilt . But I 'm not about to let a vice president of a defense contractor that is going to be bidding on the ATA have a look at Athena or be a party to any conversation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know at this stage of the game . She does n't have access . Not only no , but hell no . Sir . " " My responsibility , " Caplinger said , then clamped his lips into a thin line . " No , sir . Ludlow did n't mention any defense contractors , and even if he had , I 'd have to clear this with Admiral Dunedin . I take orders from him . He 'd probably have to talk to CNO . Her presencewould violate a couple dozen reg  --  " " Call him . " " Now ? " " Yes , goddamnit , right fucking now . We 'll wait in the lounge . " Caplinger stalked for the blue carpet that led inside , followed by Jake Grafton . The base CO led the others inside . Jake used the phone in the operations officer 's office on the seconddeck . He reached Dunedin at his office in Crystal City on the first try and outlined the situation . " Fuck ! " said the admiral . " Yessir . " " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CNO . " " Okay . " Jake gave him the phone number where he could be reached . " You 're really sticking your neck out , Jake . " " So fire me . " " I 'll call you back . " Thirty minutes went by . Jake stared out the window at the little passenger jet and watched the men with the gas truck refuel it as heat waves rose off the tarmac . Blue mountains lay on the horizon . Not a single airplane stirring this Sunday morning . After a while hep236examined the photos and mementos the ops boss had arranged on his walls . He recognized some of the names and faces in the group pictures . He was sitting behind the desk with his feet propped on it and doodling on a scratch pad when the phone rang . " Captain Grafton . " " George Ludlow . Admiral Dunedin tells me there 's a problem . " " Yessir . Caplinger and Duquesne arrived here a while ago with a vice president of Consolidated Technologies tagging along . They want her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top secret , and she 's getting an unfair advantage over the other contractors . I said no . " " What did Caplinger say ? " " He was n't happy . " " Do you understand that Hiram Duquesne is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee ? We have to have his support if we 're going to get a replacement aircraft for the A-6 . Without it we 're pissing up a rope . " " I understand that . And I understand that you chose me for this job because I can wear a Medal of Honor on my shirt and because I 'm expendable . You 're going to have me make a recommendation on which plane to buy based on a short operational evaluation flyoff , and if you like it , I 'll have to go over to Congress and defend it . You can disavow me anytime . I understand all of that . I took the job anyway . Now I 'm telling you , I ca n't go over to the Hill and make a recommendation if five or six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a scalping knife because I let Consolidatedin on the ground floor in violation of the law and DOD regulations . I wo n't be able to hide behind Royce Caplinger over there . That little shit is too goddamn small to hide behind . " Ludlow chuckled , a dry sound that lasted three or four seconds . " Go get Caplinger . I 'll talk to him . " Jake left the phone lying on the desk and went downstairs to the VIP lounge . " Mr. Secretary , you have a phone call upstairs . " Duquesne 's face was still red and mottled . DeCrescentis looked like she could chew up all of them and spit hamburger . The base CO was nowhere in sight . He had probably attacked in another direction , maybe toward the golf course . Jake followed the Defense Secretary back up the stairs . As soon as Caplinger recognized his son-in-law 's voice , heshooed Jake from the offece . Jake could hear his voice boomingp237through the door . It was n't just the Advanced Tactical Aircraft he was concerned about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roared at Ludlow : " . . . you and I both know that Grafton will probably recommend the TRX plane . With Athena , it 's the obviouschoice . But that leaves Duquesne in political trouble at home and we need his support . Jesus fucking Christ , George , you people have an aircraft carrier up for funding , three Aegis cruisers , two boomer boats , the air force wants more F-117s and some B-2s , the army wants more tanks . SDI is desperate for money . And Congress is trying to cut the deficit ! Do n't tell me to tell Duquesne to fuck off ! " He was silent for a moment , and when he spoke again his voice was low and Grafton could n't hear the words . He knew Ludlow well enough to know how it was going , however . Let Grafton take the heat , the Secretary of the Navy was probably saying . Make Grafton the villain . And that was how it went . When Caplinger came out of the office he buttonholed Jake . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must put DeCrescentis back on that plane . You will brief me and the senator this afternoon on Athena and we 'll see it in operation tomorrow . But you are going to insist that woman goes home now , and you are going to make Duquesnelike it . Got it ? " " Aye aye , sir . " The senator did n't like it , of course , and DeCrescentis liked it even less , but when Grafton made it clear that the law was going to be obeyed regardless and he was the man insisting , both of them gave ground with what grace they could muster . Duquesne had more of it than the corporate vice president did , perhaps because he knew that even Caesar had to retreat occasionally . After an hour with Samuel Dodgers in the hangar , it appeared Hiram Duquesne wished he had joined DeCrescentis on the plane . Dodgers gave Athena no more than half his air and used the rest to blast away at Congress , corporations and the **29;16311;TOOLONG . Finally Jake told him to shut up . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tones that would have stopped a rock band in full screech . Dodgers stormed off , leaving Caplinger and Duquesne gaping foolishly at each other . Jake Grafton took a deep breath , made his excuses to the two politicians , and left them in the care of a stunned llama Fritschc.  |p238In  the parking lot , he caught up with Dodgers , trembling with outrage . " You owe me an apology , " the scientist spluttered , holdinghimself rigid , his fists clenched . " No , sir , " Grafton said in a normal voice . " You owe me one . And you owe apologies to all three of those men in there . " Dodgers was speechless . " You have inflicted yourself on everyone within earshot since the day I met you . Now there 's not going to be any more of that while I 'm around . Do you understand ? " " How dare you talk to me like this ! " When Dodgers got it out , it came out loud . Jake lowered his voice still more . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as you 're concerned . You do your work and keep your personal opinions to yourself , and you and I will get along . " The scientist spluttered . " I do n't want to get along with you , you . . . " He could n't find the word . " You 'd better reconcile yourself to it if you want this project to go anywhere . " " ... sinner . Agent of Satan . " " You want money for your church , right ? I 'm the man . " With that Jake turned his back on Samuel Dodgers . The little neighborhood bar was fairly well lit and not very fancy , with cheap furniture and oilcloth table covers . A television high in one corner was tuned to a ball game , one of the NCAA tournament semifinals . Smoke Judy slid into an empty booth and ordered a draft . The waitress flirted for a moment when she brought it , then skipped away . Smoke sipped his beer and watched the body posture of the men leaning against the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , some were talking to a buddy . Most of them were doing a little of both . This was Smoke Judy 's favorite weekend beer spot , only a mile from the house . He knew the bartender casually and they often exchanged pleasantries on slow days . There were a lot worse ways to make a living , Smoke decided , than running a neighborhood bar where the guys could stop in after work or take a break from lawn mowing and garage cleaning . The crowd was nice and the work pleasant , although the money would n't be great . Maybe he would get a place like this when he retired next year . He had dropped a hint to the bartender  --  who also owned thep239place  --  a few weeks back , trying to find out if he had ever thought of selling , but the man did n't get his drift , or pretended he did n't . He was going to retire next year , with twenty-two years in . By law , as a commander he could stay in the navy until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't going to endure the hassle of staff job after staff job with no chance of promotion . The end of the line had been a tour in command of a training squadron in Texas . Four of those damn kids had crashed , three fatally . Hard to believe . He had worked hard and flown hard and done it by the book , and still those goddamned kids just kept smashing themselves into the ground like suicidal rats . The accidentinvestigators had never said or even implied he was at fault . Yet every crash had felt like God whacking him on the head , compressinganother two vertebrae . He had gotten punchy toward the end , a screamer in the cockpit , afraid to certify any student safe for anything . He left that for the lieutenants . The admiral had been sympathetic , of course , but he had no choice . He said . He had to rate Judy the lowest of all his squadron commanders . After all , four accidents ? Nine million dollars ' worth of airplanes and three lives ? That had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoted or given another command . All that remained was a decision on when to retire . He had seen it coming , like something from a Greek tragedy , after that second kid augered in on a night instrument solo . A fuckingCanoe U. grad no less ! Then the third one , that kid punched out of a perfectly good airplane on a solo acro hop after he flew into the only cloud for fifty miles in any direction for ten whole seconds and got the plane into a high-speed spiral and panicked . But he stood there in the CO 's office afterwards and said he was sorry ! The fourth one , that shithead  --  Judy had personally given him a down once already  --  one clear , cloudless day that spastic bastard failed to get the nose up to the horizon on a pullout from a simulatedstrafing run and pancaked in , smearing himself and his airplaneacross a half mile of cow pasture . The commanding officer is always responsible . And so it had been , like a judgment from the Doomsday book . Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 55 percent of his base pay , and if one or two of these little deals he was workingwith hungry contractors came through , he would do all right . Not rich , but okay . He paid for the beer and left two quarters for a tip . His car wasp240parked just fifty feet down the street , but as he walked toward it , the car in front backed right into it ! " Awww ... " The driver got out and walked back to examine the damage . " Awww , shit ! " Smoke Judy exclaimed when he saw the broken grille , the smashed headlight and the bowed-out fender . " Get your goddamn driver 's license yesterday ? " " Jesus , mister , I am sorry ! My foot just slipped off the brake . Do n't know how it happened . " " Awww , damn . The second time this year somebody has smacked it when it was parked . Look at this fender , willya ? Those Japs must make these things out of recycled beer cans . Look how this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other driver turned from examining his own bent fender and smashed taillight and surveyed Judy 's damage . He was chunky , fifty or so , flecks of gray in his hair . " Do n't worry . I got insurance . They 'll fix it good as new . But honest , I am really sorry . " " I suppose . " Smoke Judy shook his head . " Maybe we 'd better exchange information . " " Yeah . " Judy unlocked his car and fished the registration and insurance certificate from the glove box while the other driver rooted in his . " Maybe we should go inside and do this , " the chunky man suggested . " Can I buy you a beer ? " " Why not . " Smoke turned and led the way back into the bar he had just come out of . " My name 's Judy . Smoke Judy . " " Sorry we had to meet like this . I 'm Harlan Albright . " Dodgers kept his opinions to himself at dinner Sunday evening , partially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort on small talk , and partially because he could not have gotten a word in edgewise against Caplinger 's verbal flow . There were just the four of them around a table in an empty dining room  --  empty because the officers ' club was usually closed on Sunday evening and Secretary Caplinger declined to go off-base to eat  --  Dodgers , Caplinger , Senator Duquesne , and Jake Grafton . Caplingerdiscussed the budget deficit , Third World debt , global pollution , and the illegal drug industry with a depth of knowledgeand insight that amazed Jake and even quieted the senator , who , w:Is the only ncrson at the table who tried to participate inp241the conversation . It was obvious that Royce Caplinger not only had read widely but had thought deeply about all these issues . Less obvious but equally impressive was the way he wove the strands of these mega-issues into one whole cloth . After the steward placed a coffeepot in the center of the table and departed , closing the door behind him , Caplinger eyed Jake speculatively . " Well , Captain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to sound you out . " " I 'm just an 0-6 , Mr. Secretary . All I see are the elephant 's feet . " Caplinger poured himself a cup of coffee and used a spoon to stir in cream . He surveyed Samuel Dodgers as if seeing him this eveningfor the first time . " Good of you to share your Sabbath with us , Doctor . We 're looking forward to seeing your handiwork tomorrow . Dodgers wiped his mouth and tossed his napkin beside his plate . " Tomorrow . " He nodded at everyone except Grafton and departed . When the door had firmly closed behind the inventor , Caplinger remarked , " Senator , what will happen on the Hill if it becomes common gossip that the father of Athena is a fascist churl ? " " You 'll be in trouble . That man could n't sell water in Death Valley on the Fourth of July . " " My thought exactly . We 'll have to make sure he stays out of sight and sound . Little difficult to do in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did his face twisted . It did n't look like he made the effort very often . " So how do the elephant 's feet look , Captain ? " Jake Grafton reached for the coffeepot . " I confess , sir , that I 'm baffled . Seems to me that these new weapons systems under development , with the sole exception of Athena , are going to be too expensive for the nation ever to afford enough of them to do any good . " All traces of the smile disappeared from Caplinger 's face . " Goon . " " As the cost goes up , the quantity goes down . And every technicalbreakthrough ' seems to double or triple the cost . If anything , Athena will be the exception that proves the rule . Athena should he a fairly cheap system , all things considered , but it 'll be the only one . " And ... " promoted the Secretary of Defense.  | " Well , if our goal is to maintain forces which deny the Soviets any confidence in a favorable outcome in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the treadmill . We ca n't maintainforces if we ca n't afford them . " " You made a rather large assumption . " " So what is our goal ? " " The general public regards nuclear war as unwinnable . That 's the universal popular wisdom , and like anything that almost everyonebelieves , it 's wrong . The Soviets have invested heavily in hardened bunkers for the top leadership . They 've built undergroundcities for the communist elite . Somebody over there thinks they can win ! Now their idea of victory and ours are two very differentthings , but as long as they think they can win , the likelihood of a nuclear war increases . Nuclear war becomes more likely to hap-pen . " Caplinger glanced at the senator , then turned his attention back to Jake . He seemed to be weighing his words . " Our goal , " he finallysaid , " is to prevent nuclear war . To do that we must make them think they ca n't win . " " So you are saying that any method of denying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ define favorable  --  isacceptable ? " Caplinger tugged at his lower lip . His eyes were unfocused . Jake thought he seemed to be turning it over in his mind yet again , examining it for flaws , looking . . . Slowly the chin dipped , then rose again . " We need . . . " His gaze rose to the ceiling and went slowly around it . " We need . . . we need forces that can survive the initial strike and respond in a flexible manner , forces that are controllable , programmable , selective . It ca n't be all or nothing , Captain . It ca n't be just one exchange of broadsides . If all we have is that one broadside , we just lost . " " Explain , " prompted Senator Duquesne . " We 'll never shoot our broadside . That 's the dirty little secret that they know and we know and we will never admit . No man elected President of the United States in the nuclear age would order every ICBM fired , every Trident missile launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not even if the Soviets make a massive first strike at us . To massively retaliate would mean the end of life on the planet Earth . No rational man would do it . " Caplinger shrugged . " ' l'hat 's the flaw in Mutual AssuredDestruction . No sane man would ever push the button . "  |p243Royce  Caplinger sipped his coffee , now cold , and made a face . " We must deny the communists the ability to ever come out of those bunkers . We need the ability to hit pinpoint , mobile targets on a selective , as-needed basis . That 's the mission of the F-117 and the B-2 . If we can achieve that , there will never be a first strike . There will never be a nuclear war . " Caplinger pushed his chair back away from the table . " Life will continue on this planet until pollution ruins the atmosphere and sewage makes the seas a barren , watery desert . Then life on this fragile little pebble orbiting this modest star will come to the end that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Japanese televisions , listening to our compact laser disks , wearingour designer clothes , we 'll all starve . " He rose abruptly and made for the door . Jake Grafton also got to his feet . When the door closed behind Caplinger , Jake shook the senator 's hand and wished him good night . " He 's a great man , " the senator said , trying to read Jake 's thoughts . " Yes . " " But he is not sanguine . The political give-and-take  --  it depresseshim . " " Yes , " Jake Grafton said , and nodded his farewell . Suddenly he too needed to be alone . On Monday morning Jake put Secretary Caplinger , Senator Duquesne , and their aides on a plane to Fallon with Helmut Fritsche and Harold Dodgers . He had decided to stay at China Lake and supervise the good doctor . Sam Dodgers was in a foul mood , muttering darkly about money and conspiracies . Jake managed to keep his mouth shut . When the Athena device was ready and installed in the A-6 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cockpit . Toad was whistling some tune Jake did n't recognize . " No birds today . Okay ? " " Whatever you say , boss . " Toad was in high spirits . Higher than usual . He must be screwing Moravia , Jake decided , trying to catch some hint between them . The pilot was all business . " Work the long distances today . Start at thirty miles and let Fritsche call you closer when he has the info he wants . Just keepthe radar he 's usinv on your left side "  | " Sure , CAG . We understand . " He resumed his whistling as Jake helped him latch his Koch fittings . " You know who whistles in the navy , Toad ? " " No , sir . " " Bosun 's mates and damn fools . " Toad grinned . " I 'm in that second category , sir . Enjoy your day with Dr. Dodgers . " Jake punched him on the shoulder and climbed down the boardingladder . As the Intruder taxied out , Jake climbed into the yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had no desire to return to the hangar and watch Dodgers tinker with a computer . He drove down a taxiway and parked near the duty runway . He got out and sat on the hood . Already the morning was warm , growinghotter by the minute as the sun climbed higher and higher into the deep blue sky . Singing birds were audible here , away from the hustle and bustle of the ramp . A large jackrabbit watched him from the safety of a clump of brush . He could hear the faint murmur of engines in the distance , and assumed that was Rita and Toad . The minutes passed as he sat there in the sun with the breeze in his hair . He had joined the navy those many years ago to fly , and now he was reduced to sitting beside a runway waiting for younger people to take off . Yet this was the world he knew . The world Royce Caplinger had spoken of last night  --  nuclear deterrence , global strategy  --  that was an alien environment , as foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Amazon . He saw the tiny tail of the warplane moving above the swell in the runway . It turned and became a knife edge . Still at least a mile away , the visible tail came to a stop and remained motionless for several minutes . Caplinger 's pessimism troubled him . Sure , the world had its problems , but every generation had faced problems : problems were the stuff life was made of . A man as brilliant as Caplinger , he should n't be so . . . so bitter . He heard the engines snarl , yet the tiny white speck of tail did not move . No doubt Rita was standing on the brakes , letting the engines wind up to full power and the temps stabilize before she let it roll . Now . . . now the tail began to move , slowly at first , then faster and faster . The intruder came over the swell in the runway acceleratingp245quickly . A river of hot , shimmering air poured down and away behind the bird . He pressed his fingers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The nose wheel rose a foot or so above the concrete . With a delicate wiggle the bird of prey lifted itself free of the earth and continued toward him in a gentle climb as the wheels retracted into the body of the beast . The howl of the engines grew until it was intolerable . Now the machine was passing just overhead , roaring a thunderoussong that enveloped him with an intensity beyond imagination . He glimpsed the helmeted figure of Rita Moravia in the cockpit with her left hand on the throttles , looking forward , toward the open sky . He buried his face in his shoulder as the plane swept past and waves of hot jet exhaust and disturbed air cascaded over him . When the gale subsided the noise was fading too , so he looked again for the Intruder . It was climbing steeply into the blue ocean above , its engine noise now a deep , resonant , subsiding roar . He got down from the truck hood and seated himself behind the wheel . The birds in the scrub were still singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , Jake Grafton started the engine of the pickup and drove away.  |p246The  day Terry Franklin died wasa beautiful day , " the finest day this year " according to a TV weatherman on one of Washington 's local breakfast shows . The sun crept over the edge of the earth into a cloudless sky as a warm , gentle zephyr from the west stirred the new foliage . The weather reader promised a high temperature of seventy-four . Humidity was low . This was the day everyone had dreamed of while they enduredthe cold , humid winter and the wet , miserable spring . Now , at last , it was here . And on this day sent from heaven Terry Franklindied . He certainly did n't expect to die today , of course , or any other day in the foreseeable future . For him this was just another day to be endured , another day to live through on his way to the life of gleeful indolence he was earning with his treason . He awoke when his alarm went off . If he heard the birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used his electric razor on his face and gave his teeth a very quick pass with the cordless toothbrush he received for Christmas from his kids , whom he had n't seen or heard from for three weeks and , truthfully , hoped he would n't hear from . If he heard from the kids he would also hear from Lucy , and she would want money . He assumed that she was back in California with her mother , the wicked witch of thep247west . If so , Lucy did n't need any money : her father the tooth mechaniccould pay the grocery bill and buy the kids new shoes . He put on his uniform while the coffee brewed . The coffee he drank black , just the way he had learned to like it on his first cruise , which he had made to the Med aboard a guided-missile frigate . He paused automatically on the front stoop and looked around for the morning newspaper , then remembered that there would n't be one and pulled the door closed and tried it to ensure it was locked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He never read it and Lucy only scanned the front page and read the funnies . She always wanted it for the crossword puzzle , which she worked every morning while watching Oprah . Twenty-five cents a day for a fucking crossword puzzle . He had relished that call to the circulation office . The Datsun started on the first crank . He backed out of the drive and rolled down his window as he drove toward the stop sign at the corner . He fastened his seat belt , punched up the Top 40 station on the stereo and rolled . He only had three miles to go to the Park'N'Ride , but still he enjoyed the private little world of his car . These few minutes in the car , with the music he liked adjustedto the volume he liked , he cherished as the best part of the day . He had n't heard from the Russians since his talk with that Yuri fellow , and he had mixed emotions about that . In a way it was quite pleasant not sweating drop trips or clandestine computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pentagon . Yet every day that went by without a call was another day he had to waste on his dreary , humdrum job , on this humdrum bus ride , on this humdrum colorless suburb . Every day he spent here was a day he was n't there , lying in the sun , fucking the beach bunnies , drinkingCuba Libres and enjoying life . His fantasy was there , waiting , and he was firmly and hopelessly planted here . What made the waiting so frustrating was the money he already had in the bank . That he had committed a variety of serious crimes to obtain the money troubled him not a whit . He had never given it a moment 's thought . In fact , he felt exactly like all the other people who see a large sum of unearned money come their way -- lottery winners , traffic accident victims , legatees , swindlers , personal injury lawyers and so on  --  the money was his by divine rieht . Somehow . some way . the rulers of the universep248had decreed that he deserved the good things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't like all those schmucks who flog it eight to five . He was different . Special . The money made him special . The unique and wonderful emissions given off by large quantities of money made him tingle . Perhaps because he felt so good about himself , Terry Franklin took the time this morning , the last morning of his life , to smile at the bus driver as he boarded and to nod at a woman he recognized as he went down the aisle . As the bus threaded its way through rush hour traffic , he watched the scenery roll by without seeing a thing . He rode lost in reverie , already enjoying his fantasy . The morning was spent cleaning and repairing a computer keyboardon which a secretary had spilled coffee . She also had a taste for doughnuts and potato chips , he noted with a sneer as he worked with a toothbrush to rid the mechanism of soggy crumbs . He could just picture her : still young but already overweight , alwaysdieting or talking to her fellow airheads about dieting as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coffee loaded with sugar . She must have had at least three lumps in this stuff she spilled . Lucy 's clone . He almost decided to tell the chief to trash this keyboard , then changed his mind . The chief had cut him a lot of slack these past three weeks : he should try to prove to the chief that he could still carry his share of the load . He put more WD-40 on the keyboard and reattacked the sticky mess with the toothbrush . Terry Franklin 's last meal was a hot dog with mustard , catsup and relish , a small order of fries and a medium Sprite . He ate it with another sailor from his section in the main cafeteria . They discussed the new secretary in the division office  --  was she really a blonde , would she or would n't she , was it worth trying to find out , and so on . The afternoon went quickly . The chief sent him with one other man to work on a balky tape drive in the enlisted manpower section , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem but had not yet repaired it when quitting time rolled around . So he carried his tools back to the shop and exchanged guffaws with his shipmates , then walked to the bus stop outside and found a place in the usual line . Had he known what was coming , one wonders what he wouldhave done differently . No doubt a larger man who knew the endp249was nigh might have lived his last day pretty much as he had all his others , but Terry Franklin was not a big man in any sense of the word , and he had come to realize that in the last three weeks , since the fiasco of the bungled drop . He knew he was a coward , a weaklingwithout backbone or character , but , he thought , only he knew , and so what ? Superman lives in Metropolis and Batman lives in Gotham . The rest of us just try to get along . Yet , given who he was and what he was , should he have known he might be approaching the end of his string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it through dispassionately , with some detachment . He did n't , of course . He used most of his last hour on earth to stare out the bus windowand think about the feel of the sun on his back and sand between his bare toes , and to daydream of a hard young female body under him mingling her sweat with his . She did n't have a face , this girl in his dreams , but she had firm brown tits and a flat stomach and long brown legs with taut thighs . When he turned the key in the car ignition the radio boomed to life as the engine caught . " . . . like a bat outta hell , ba-dupe , badupey ... " He rolled the window down and fastened his seat belt and pattedthe steering wheel with his hands in time to the music . The car in front of him turned right after four blocks , and the one behind turned left a block later . Terry Franklin paid no attention . He drove out onto an old boulevard now lined with small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car onto a side street . He liked to drive through these quiet residential streets because they had so little traffic and he thought he made better time , though he had never clocked it . At the first stop sign he came to , a little girl was crossing the street pushing a miniature baby carriage containing her doll . That she had chosen to cross the street at just this time and place probablygave Terry Franklin another minute of life . One minute was just about the time it took for him to wait until the little girl was clear , depress the accelerator and cruise down to the next cross street . He glanced both ways , no traffic , and took his foot off the brake to roll on through . " ... like a bat outta hell ... " " That 's when the bomb underneath the vehicle , directly under the driver 's scat , exploded . " Terry Franklin felt a concussive impact as his knees came up to smash into ht thin hot that was air only NrnNatinn that hr w:lNp250conscious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live . The floor of the car came apart and the seat springs and fabric and paddingwere all forced explosively upward . His skull popped like a ripe melon when this rising , accelerating column on which he sat smashed into the roof of the car and bowed it upward . The windowsexploded outward as the fireball continued to expand , showeringthe area with glass . Fragments of springs and plastic and fabric were forced deep into Terry Franklin 's now lifeless corpse , which began to sear from the intense heat . The car , still in gear and torn almost in two , moved like a wounded crab diagonally across the intersection and lightly impacteda parked vehicle . Then the engine quit from fuel starvation . The severed fuel line dumped its liquid into the molten mess in the center of the vehicle and the smoldering wreckage became an inferno . In ten seconds the fire was so hot the fuel tank exploded . Coming around the corner four blocks away , FBI agent Clarence Brown saw the rising fireball from the exploding gas tank . He grabbed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . It blew up ! The subject 's car blew up ! " The voice on the telephone had a hollow , metallic sound , like it was coming through a long pipe . " Little development I thought you would want to know about , Luis . Probably nothing important . Terry Franklin just went out with a bang . His car blew up . " " Anybody else hurt , Dreyfus ? " " Not another soul . We had an agent following him , keeping tabs per your instructions , and he saw the gas tank go poof . The lab guys are on the way . The agent at the scene , Brown , says it looks like a bomb . " " What time , exactly ? " " Sixteen fifty-seven . " Camacho looked at his watch . Seventeen minutes ago . " Get a search warrant for his house . " " Already doing the affidavit . " " Send a man over to the house to watch it . And you 'd better alert somebody out in California that they 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the medical exam-iner . " " The ID 's gon na take a while . The corpse is still in the car , roasted like a Christmas turkey . "  | " Have the people in California quietly check to see that his wife and in-laws are physically there . " " You knew this was going to happen , did n't you ? " " I just follow orders , asshole , " Camacho snarled . " Why do n't you do the same ? " He slammed the phone onto its cradle . Two minutes later it rang again . " Yes . " " Dreyfus again . Already we 're getting calls from TV stations . There 's a chopper overhead now . It 's real visual with the smoke column and all . Evening news for sure , distraught housewives and sobbing kids , the whole bit . What 's the official hot screaming poop ? " " We 're investigating , cooperating with the local police . Off the record , hint at drugs . " " Roger hint . " " Is local law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a big red fire truck . " " Do n't let ' em touch anything . " " Roger Wilco , over and out . " Luis Camacho pulled into his driveway at five minutes after midnight and checked the jury-rigged bulb in the hole in the door panel . Still off . Amen . The night air retained some of the heat from the day . The FBI agent stood in his shirt sleeves beside his car and breathed the deep , rich scent of the earth . The neighborhood was quiet . He could hear crickets . All the lights were off in Harlan Albright 's house . Only a gleam of the hall light was visible through the window of his own door . Camacho picked up the package on his front seat and locked his car , then used his key on the front door . He shot the bolt behind him . There was a note by the phone . Albright had called . Camacho poured himself a bourbon and added three ice cubes from the tray in the freezer . He opened the kitchen door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows in the backyard . The dog whined and wagged its tail. ' raking his time , Camacho strolled the length of the yard and seated himself in the tire swing hanging from the old oak . He absentlypetted the dog and made comforting noises as he sipped the liquor and let the alcohol take effect.  |p252It  would be interesting to see how many of those servos were still in Albright 's - mad bomber kit . And the batteries and fuses . You sure had to take your hat off to Peter Aleksandrovich , a.k.a. good ol ' Harlan . Terry Franklin 's sudden end had been a nice tidy job . No loose ends . No secondary casualties that might fester into an eventual murder indictment that would make a spy swap impossible , should the worst happen and he get arrested by the FBI . Terry Franklin had been very neatly and permanently silenced . Scratch one asset-turned-debit . Clean up that balance sheet . Wipe off the red ink , and , voila ! we have a profitable enterprise , as anyonecan plainly see . Good ol ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The big maples in front shielded it from the streetlights and the oaks and beeches here in back performed a similar service with that little alley light . So the house was just a looming black shape . Camacho thought about the stairs up to the bedroom , pictured himself once again slipping up there , careful as a mouse , looking for booby traps , prying open the trapdoor to the attic  --  he shivered as he thought about it . Good ol ' Harlan would probably rig some more unpleasant surprises , like plastique that goes boom when the someone coming into a room steps in the wrong place , or forgets to turn the light on and off three times in three seconds . Good ol ' Harlan would be just the man for a little rig like that . Wonder if Harlan 's found the blank film in the camera ? Had Camacho been careful enough with the operation ? Had he tripped a camera he did n't find ? If so , that bulb in the door would come on very soon . His fatigue hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to walk back to the house , lock the door , and ascend the stairs . He stripped off his clothes and fell into bed . " I do n't want to ever get married , " Rita said . " Me neither , " Toad Tarkington agreed fervently . " Half the marriages fail , kids in single-parent households , everybody broke  --  who needs it ? " It was a pretty Saturday morning and they were on their way to a restaurant for breakfast , with Toad at the wheel . " People should be free to have a relationship without being bound , " she said . " When two people break up they should n't have to hire lawyers to fight over the dog . " " Marriage is an obsolete institution . "  | " It 's doomed , " Toad pronounced , sounding a good bit like SamuelDodgers denouncing sin , which was probably unintentional . But to prove he was n't a bigot he added , " Of course , my parents are happily married . Thirty-five years this July . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only married three years , one kid  --  the divorce was real messy . My dad had to help her with the legal fees . " " Did she get custody ? " Rita asked . Toad told her about it . Both of them shook their heads sadly . Truly , modern marriage was a misery . " Two people who love each other do n't need all that , " Rita sniffed . " I want a man who loves me and wants to be with me , not because he has to , but because he wants to . " " It 's the has-to part that turns me off , " Toad explained . " You know , I think it 's terrific that you and I think so much alike . " " Well , we 're very similar . We both have middle-class backgrounds , good educations , we 're naval officers , we fly . You 're only a year older than I am . It 's no wonder . " " I guess . " Toad wheeled her Mazda into the restaurant parking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Rita and she smiled her thanks , a gorgeous little grin that he returned . She rested her fingerslightly on his arm as they walked across the macadam . He held the door for her and she preceded him through . He had never felt better in his life  --  so alive , so into all of it . They loved each other without strings . And the best part , he told himself , was that they could be so forthright , so frank with each other . Would n't the world be a better place if everyone 's relationships were so open and honest ? They were married that afternoon in Oakland , Maryland . The glider wheeled and soared six feet above the dune , the sun flashing on its wings . Jake Grafton sat in the sand with the wind at his back . David and Amy sat beside him , hugging their knees . He manipulated the levers on the radio control box without taking his eyes from the free-flying bird . " Remember to keep the nose up in the turns , " David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass a hundred feet north along the dune where Jake had been turning . He had the techniquenow , he hoped . Ile had n't crashed in ten minutes . Ile thought he could stay aloft as long as the wind remained steady.  |p254Back  the glider came , crossing silently above their heads . " Totallyawesome , " David murmured . " Awesome " seemed to be the word this year in the sixth grade . What had it been when Jake had been twelve years old ? He tried to remember and drew a blank . Amy Carol stretched out in the sand on her stomach , her chin on her forearms . Her figure was still a collection of straight lines . Callie said she would start to fill out soon . David matched her position , his big feet incongruous beside Amy 's petite ones . No doubt his growth would also spurt in the next year or so ; he already had the feet of a good-sized man , though the rest of him had a lot further to go . " Your dad 's gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He is n't my dad . He 's Jake . " " He 's gon na be good , " David insisted . " That 's not so tough to do , " she said , sitting up . " Oh no ? Why do n't you try it . " " Can I , Jake ? " " Yeah . Come over here and watch me for a minute . " He explained the controls and demonstrated how they worked . After two passes up and down the beach with Amy watching intently , he turned the box over to her . She overbanked and nosed the plane in on the very next turn . David smacked his hands together in exasperation . " Nothing to it . ' Girls ! " He pronounced the last word as if it were spelled " gurls . " The left wing had torn skin and a broken spar . The three aviatorscollected their gear and trudged for the house . " Do n't worry , Cap'n , " the boy said with a disgusted glance at Amy , " I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure you can , " Jake told him , grinning . " Girls do n't know nothin ' about flyin ' . " " Do n't bet on it , Dave . There 's a woman pilot working for me , and she 's real darn good . " Amy squared her shoulders , threw her head back and marched proudly before them , at long last assuming her rightful place among the exalted sisters . " You 're what ? " exclaimed Harriet , Rita 's horrified roommate . It was Sunday evening and they were in the bedroom . Out in the Iiviyu nom Toad had settled in to watch a Knicks eame.  |p255Rita  held up her left hand and waggled it proudly . " Here 's the ring . I 'm married . " " My God ! How long have you known him ? A month ? How long were you engaged ? " " A little over an hour . We were driving to Deep Creek Lake for the weekend and around Frostburg we decided to get married . So Toad drove off the next exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knew a lady in the county clerk 's office  --  she was a member of his church  --  and she drove downtown and opened up the courthouse just to issue us a license . Was n't that sweet ? " Harriet lowered herself onto the bed and covered her face with her hands . " The minister 's wife gave me some flowers from her garden . Some paper-white narcissus and tulips and multicolored butterfly daffodils , all accented by bridalwreath in a beautiful bouquet . I cradled them in my right arm when we said our vows . " She sighed , remembering . " I have the best ones down in the car . I thought you and I could press them . " " A one-hour engagement ! Rita , Rita , Rita , you poor poor child . What do you know about this man ? What ? " Harriet opened the bedroom door a crack and looked with loathing at the groom sagged out in front of the TV with a beer in his hand . No wonder they called him Toad . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she hissed . " What do you know about him ? He could be AC-DC or a closet pervert , or even a Republican ! What will your mother say ? " Harriet spun like a lioness ready to pounce . " Have you told her yet ? " " Wellll  --  " " I knew it ! When are you going to tell her ? After all , Rita , she is your mother . She once told me that after buying a thousand weddingpresents for all of your friends , she was so looking forward to inviting every one of them to your wedding . You 're her only daughter ! " Harriet threw herself backward onto her bed and bounced once . " How could you ? " she moaned . " It was easy , " Rita Moravia Tarkington said lightly . She dearly enjoyed Harriet 's tantrums . " It was so romantic . Just like I always wanted it to he . He 's so handsome , so . . . We 're going to be so very happy all our lives . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed again and smiled  |p256On  Monday morning Lieutenant Toad Tarkington and Lieutenant Rita Moravia entered Jake 's office together , side by side . They stopped in front of his desk and waited at parade rest until he looked up from the report he was working on . " Yeah . " " We have some news for you , Captain , " Rita said . Jake carefully surveyed their expectant faces . He scowled . " Why have I got the feeling I 'm not going to enjoy this ? " Rita and Toad both grinned broadly and glanced at each other . " We 're married , " Toad said . Jake Grafton clapped his hands over his ears . " I did n't hear that . Whatever it was , I did n't hear it . And I do n't want to hear it . " He stood and leaned slightly toward them , his voice low : " I have enough problems around here without people sniping at me about the romantic status of my test crew . What you two do on your own time is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completedand I submit the report , you two puppies are going to walk the line for me . All business . No kissy-facey or kootchy-koo or groping or any of that other goofy hooey . No glorious announcements . Strictly business . " " Yes , sir , " Rita said . " I warned you about this , Tarkington . No romances , I said . And look at you ! It 's disgusting , that 's what it is . " " Yessir , " Toad said . " I ca n't let you out of my sight for a minute . " " I just could n't control myself , sir . " " You two are going to be very happy someday . But not today or tomorrow . Right now you 're serious , committed , dedicated professionals . Pretend . Try real hard . " " Yessir , " they both said . " Congratulations . Get back to work . " " Aye aye , sir . " They came to attention like plebes at the Naval Academy , did a smart about-face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lip and resumed work on his report.  |p257Somebody  explain how this airplaneis going to be used . " Jake Grafton looked from face to face . He had his staff gathered around while he stood at the office blackboardwith marker in hand . " Who wants the floor ? " " Captain , there 's been two or three studies on that written duringthe last three or four years , " said Smoke Judy . " I know . Somebody dug them out for me and I read them . I want to hear your ideas . " " Seems to me , " said Toad Tarkington , " that the first thing it has to do is land and take off from a carrier . Must be carrier-com-patible . " Jake wrote that down . Obvious , but often overlooked . Any navy attack plane must have a tailhook , nose tow , strong keel , routinely tolerate a six-hundred foot-per-minute sink rate collision with the deck on landing , fit into allotted deck space and accept electrical power and inertial alignment information from the ship 's systems . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arrested with existing machinery . In addition , it would have to be able to fly down a 3.5-degree glide slope carrying enough power to make a wave-off feasible , and with a low enough nose attitude so that the pilot could see the carrier 's optical landing system . Amazinglyenough , in the late 1960s the navy was almost forced to buy ap258plane that was n't carrier-compatible  --  the TFX , which the air force called the F-111 and immediately began using as an all-weather tactical bomber with a system identical to the A-6 's . " Corrosion-resistant , " Tarkington added as Jake made furious notes . " Has to be able to withstand long exposure to salty environmentwithout a lot of expensive maintenance . " " Maintenance , " muttered Les Richards . " Got to have easy maintainabilty designed in . Easy access to engines , black boxes and so forth , without a lot of special equipment . " The requirements came thick and fast now , as quick as Jake could write . Range , speed , payload and a lot of other parameters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board and his staff paused for air . " How 're we going to use this thing ? " he asked again . " What I 'm getting at is this : these stealth designs appear to be optimized for high-altitude ingress over heavily defended territory . Presumably at night . Are all our missions going to be at night ? " " We ca n't afford to give away the day , " someone said . " What 's that mean in the way of aircraft capability ? Daytime means enemy fighters and optically aimed surface-to-air missiles . They 'll see our plane . Do we have to be able to engage the fighters and dodge the missiles ? How much G capability do we need ? Sustainedturning ability ? Dash speed ? Climb speed ? Will we go in low in the daytime ? If so , how about ability to withstand bird strikes and turbulence ? " The staff spent an hour on these questions . There was no consensus , nor did Jake expect one . No plane in the world could do everything , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended employment . Shortcomings due to design trade-offs would have to be overcome or endured . " Weapons . " The ideal plane would carry and deliver every weapon in the U.S. and NATO inventory , and a lot of them . Was that a realistic goal with the stealth designs under consideration ? After four hours of brainstorming , the staff reexamined the proposedtest program for the prototypes . In the five flights of each airplane that SECDEF had budgeted money and time for , they needed to acquire as much information as possible to answer real questions . Company test pilots had already flown both planes . These five flights of each plane by the navy would have to produce data that verified or refuted the manufacturers ' claims . More im/to fill the navy 's mission requirements , or which could be made so by cost-effective modifications . " We really need more than five flights per plane , Captain , " Les Richards said . " Five flights are enough for what we want to find out , if we do it right . This little evolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driving . Five flights are enough for what we want to find out if we do it right , which is precisely what we 're going to do . Henry and Ludlow and Caplinger want a fast recommendation and a fast decision . " " Do n't they always ? Then the paper pushers in SECDEF 's officewill spend a couple years mulling it over , sending it from in basket to in basket . " " Ours is not to reason why ... " The pace accelerated relentlessly in the office . Working days lasted twelve hours now , and Jake ran everyone out and turned off the lights himself at 7 P.M. He insisted that no one work on Saturdayand Sunday , believing that the break would make people more productive during the week . The weeks slid by , one by one . Jake spent less than half his time in the office and the rest in an endless series of meetings with people from everywhere in government : SECNAV , SECDEF , OPNAV , NAVAIR , NAVSEA , the FAA , the EPA , the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of the time he attended these conferences with Admiral Dunedinor Commander Rob Knight . The meetings went on and on , the paper piled higher and higher . The same subjects kept cropping up in different meetings , where they had to be rehashed again and again . Government by committee is government by consensus , and key players from every office high and low had to be listened to and pacified . Jake felt like the sorcerer 's apprentice as he tried to pin people down and arrive at final resolutions of issues . Meetings bred more meetings : the final item on every agenda was to set the times and places for follow-up meetings . He discovered to his horror that no one person had a complete grasp of the tens of thousands of regulations and directives that covered every aspect of procurement . At every meeting , it seemed , someone had another requirement that needed to be at least given lip service . He finally found where all this stuff was stored , a librarythat at last measurement contained over 1,152 linear feet of statutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defensep260procurement . Jake Grafton looked at this collection in awe and disgust , and never visited the place again . The silent army of faceless gnomes who spent their working lives writing , interpreting , clarifying , and applying these millions of paragraphsof " thou shalts " and " thou shalt nots " took on flesh and substance . They came in all sexes , shapes , and colors , each with his or her own coffee cup and a tiny circle of responsibility , which , no matter how small , of course overlapped with that of three or four others . The key players were all known to Jake 's staff : " Watch out for the Arachnid , " someone would say before a meeting . Or " Beware of the Sewer Rat . He 'll be there this morning . " " The Gatekeeper will grill you on this . " The staff named these key players in the procurement process because of their resemblance to the characters in the game Dungeons and Dragons . When he returned from battle Jake had to contribute to the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's a miracle that the navy even owns a rowboat , " Grafton remarkedone day to Admiral Dunedin . " True , but the Russians are more screwed up than we are . They manage every single sector of their economy like this , not just the military . You ca n't even buy toilet paper in a store over there . " " The bureaucrat factor is a multiplier , " Jake decided . " The more people there are to do paperwork , the more paper there is to be worked and the slower everything goes , until finally the wheels stop dead and only the paper moves . " " The crat factor : it 's a law of physics , " Dunedin agreed . Jake took a briefcase full of unclassified material home every night , and after Callie and Amy were in bed he stayed awake until midnight scribbling notes , answering queries , and reading replies and reports prepared by his staff . He spent countless hours on the budget , trying to justify every dollar he needed for the next fiscal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program would be then , and then he had to justify the assumptions . Athena was still buried deep , outside the normal budgetary process . Still he would need staff and travel money and all the rest of it . He involved everyone he could lay hands on and cajoled Admiral Dunedin into finding him two more officers and another yeoman . He did n't have desks for them . They had to share . But things were being accomplished . A Request for Proposal(RFP) on the Athena project was drafted , chopped by everyone upp261and down the line , committeed and lawyered and redrafted twice and finally approved . Numbered copies went by courier to a half dozen major defense contractors who were believed to have the technical facilities and staff to handle development of a small superconductingcomputer for aviation use . The office staff had to be informed , and this had been done by the admiral . Inevitably the number of people who knew about Athena and what it could do was expanding exponentially . Access was still strictly need-to-know , but the system ensured that a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , citing chapter and verse of some regulation or directive no one else had ever read or even seen . Callie was understanding about the time demands Jake faced . She had spent enough years as a navy wife to know how the service worked . Amy was less so . She and Callie were still going round and round , and she found Jake a pleasant change . He made rules and he enforced them , and he tucked her into bed every night . She wanted more of his time and he had precious little to give . The weekends became their special time together . " Why do you spend so much time at work , Jake ? " " It 's my job . I have to . " " I 'm not going to have a job like yours . I 'm going to get a job that gives me plenty of time to spend with my little girl . " " Are you my little girl ? " " No . I 'm Amy . I 'm not anybody 's little girl . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own someday . " " Do you ever think much about those somedays ? What they 'll be like ? " " Sure . I 'll have lots of money and lots of time and a very nice little girl to buy stuff for and spend time with . " " How are you going to get lots of money if you do n't spend much time earning it ? " " I 'm going to inherit it . From you and Callie . " " Guess we 'd better work hard then . " One day in early May , Special Agent Lloyd Dreyfus made an appointment to see Luis Camacho 's boss , P. R. Bigelow , without telling Camacho . He had thought about it for a week before he made the appointment with the secretary , and then he had two more days to wait . Jumping the chain of command was as grievous a sin in the FBI as it was in the military , yet he had decided to do it anyway and to hell with what Camacho or anyone else thought.  |p262As  the day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased with each passing hour . Surely Bigelow would understand . Even if he did n't , he must realize Dreyfus had a right and duty to voice his concerns . Dreyfus rehearsed his speech carefully . It was n't technically a speech : perhaps a better description would be " short , panicky monologue . " He had to justify himself as soon as he opened his mouth , get Bigelow 's sympathetic attention before he had a chance to start quoting the regulations , before he lost his cool and went ballistic . Was Bigelow a ballistic kind of guy ? Dreyfus could n't recallCamacho ever saying . He tried to recall everything he had ever heard about P. R. Bigelow , and that was n't much . Strange , when you stopped to think about it . Camacho never mentioned his superior officer , never said , " Bigelow wants this , " or " Bigelow is pleased , " or " Bigelow says blah-blah . " Come to think of it , Camacho never talked about anyone . If the Director himself told Luis Camacho to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do this " or " Do that . " He sometimes said what he hoped to find or achieve , but he never even hinted who had told him to cause something to happen , or why it was to happen . He never expressed a personal opinion . Curious as hell . Camacho was one weird duck , beyond a reasonable doubt . Sitting in Bigelow 's reception area with the secretary checking him out surreptitiously as she did her nails , Dreyfus went over his list one more time . He wanted everything right on the tip of his tongue . It would be worse than disastrous to think of the clincher on the way to the surgery in the dungeon . Once again he assured himself he was doing the right thing . The right thing . Doing the right thing . He fondled his pipe in his pocket as if it were a set of worry beads . The ten-button phone on the nail polisher 's desk buzzed to attractits owner 's attention . After listening a moment and grunting into the instrument in a pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dreyfus , " He 'll see you now . " Her painted eyebrows arched knowingly , condescendingly . P. R. Bigelow was eating a large jelly doughnut at his desk . He mumbled his greeting with his mouth full , a glob of red goo in the corner of his mouth . Dreyfus took a chair and launched into his prepared remarks . " I 've asked for this time , sir , to ensure you know what is going on with the Minotaur investigation . The answer is almost nothing . Formonths now we 've been spinning our wheels , begging computerp263time to try and crack the Minotaur 's letters to the Soviet ambassador , following a few people hither and yon all over Washington , monitoring some phone lines , wasting an army of manpower and bushels of money , and we are going essentially nowhere . I thought you should know that . " Bigelow wiped the jam from his lips with a napkin , sipped coffee from a white mug labeled " World 's Best Dad " and took another bite of doughnut . His attitude rattled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowl carefully . " Our best lead was a navy enlisted computer technician in the Pentagon , a guy we thought was tapping the computerfor some of this stuff . Name of Terry Franklin . Yet Camacho never let us pick the guy up . So we sat and watched him do his little thing , and we were diligently following him , right on his tail , in March when his car blew up with him in it . " Bigelow finished the doughnut and used a moist finger to capture and convey the last few crumbs to his mouth . Then he dabbed his lips a final time and used two napkins to scrub the powdered sugar and flecks of jelly from his oak desk . He put this trash in the wastebasket and , sighing contentedly , rearranged his bottom in his chair . " And . . . ? " said P. R. Bigelow . " A hit man wiped a walk-in witness to a drop with Franklin . Camacho talked to her a couple times , but she got eliminated before we could get her to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slugs in the skull . We 've got the autopsy and lab reports and we 've talked to neighbors up and down the street . We 've got nothing at all . We 're absolutely dry on this one . " " Anything else ? " " Yes , " said Lloyd Dreyfus with an edge in his voice . He was beginning to lose his temper and did n't care if it showed a little . " One of the staff officers in the navy 's ATA project  --  a CommanderJudy  --  is trying to peddle classified inside info to interesteddefense contractors . We got interested in this officer when the project manager was murdered over in West Virginia one Fridayevening in early February . That murder is unsolved  --  no one is doing anything on it  --  and Camacho does n't appear to be doing any follow-up on Judy 's contacts . He has n't even turned the file over to the fraud investigators or NIS . We know some of the people Judy 's talked to and . . . " Dreyfus threw up his hands in frustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that about covers it . "  | " So you asked for this appointment on the off chance that Camacho has been lying to me about the activities of his office , purposely bungling the search for this mole , wasting millions of dollars and thousands of man-hours on wild-goose chases . " Dreyfus opened his mouth to interrupt , but Bigelow held up a hand . " I grant that you can probably phrase it more tactfully . You notice I did not suggest that you came up here to tattle and gain some personal advantage . You are a better man than that . " He sighed heavily , almost a belch . " Of course there is another possibility . Perhaps you just wanted to see if I was so stupid as to be satisfied with the progress of the investigation to date . " " I  --  " The upraised palm stopped him again . " I am satisfied . Camacho has kept me fully informed of the activities of his subordinates , of which you are one , by the way . His lines of inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my approval . He has discussed his concerns with me and I have informed him of mine . He has followed orders to the letter . I am completely satisfied with his performance . He is one of the most talented senior officers in the bureau . " Dreyfus just stared . " Before you go back to work , do you wish for me to arrange a meeting for you with the Director ? " Bigelow managed to make his face look interested and mildly amused at the same time . Yes , Lloyd , you miserable , disloyal , alarmist peckerhead , you jumped from the top of the cliff , but you seem to have had the luck to strike a bush a few feet below the edge , which arrested your downwardprogress . Do you wish my help in completing your suicidal plunge ? Dreyfus shook his head no . " I suggest that you not mention this little conversation to any of your colleagues . " " Yessir . " " I do n't want to see you in this office ever again , Dreyfus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I send for you . " " Yessir . " " Let 's both get back to work . " P. R. Bigelow nodded toward the closed office door and Dreyfus took the hint . By mid-May the dance of the dwarves at the Pentagon had reached a critical frenzy . A thousand details were beginning to come together for a trip into the desert with the prototypes in June . Thep265airplanes had been moved weeks earlier to the Tonopah Test Range in Nevada , the same secret field where the air force had tested its stealth prototypes . Also known as Area 58 , or Groom Lake , the field lay about a hundred miles northwest of Las Vegas on a huge government reservation with excellent physical security . Here the contractors ' field teams readied the planes in separate hangars and installed telemetry devices . Toad and Rita would leave for Nevada two weeks before Jake and the rest of the staff . They had intensive sessions planned with company test pilots and engineers to learn everything they could about the planes and how they flew . The Saturday night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner at the house in RehobothBeach . " How do you like being married ? " Callie asked Rita in the kitchen . " I should have had a brother , " Rita confided . " Men are such sloppy creatures . They do n't think like we do . " On the screened-in porch , Jake and Toad sipped on bourbon and Amy slurped a Coke . " So how 's married life , Toad ? " " Oh , so-so , I guess . Is n't exactly like I thought it would be , but nothing ever is. 01 ' Rita can think up stuff for me to do faster than I can do it , and we only live in an apartment . If we had a town house or something with a basement and a lawn , she 'd have worked me to death by now . " Amy Carol thought this remark deliriously funny and giggled hugely . " Why do n't you go visit with Mom and Rita ? " She stood regally and tossed her hair . " I do believe I will join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish you 'd stop calling her that . " She flounced off toward the kitchen . " The day she "  --  Jake pointed after the departing youngster  --  " gets married , I am going to get down on my knees and give thanks . " " That bad , huh ? " " She 's about driven Callie over the edge . That poor woman had no idea what she was getting into . No matter how much love she pours on Amy , the kid still does exactly as she chooses . She intentionallydisobeys and cuts up just to get her goat . And Callie never gets mad , never pops off , never gives her anything but love . She 's gon na go nuts . " " Maybe she should get angry . "  | " That 's what I think . And Callie insists she does n't want my help or advice . " " They 're all alike , " Toad said , now vastly experienced . Amy was back in five minutes , hopping from foot to foot , so excited she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I can show Rita ? She 's a pilot . " Toad gasped . " She is ? " " You 're teasing me , " Amy said , stamping her foot . " The wind 's wrong , " Jake pointed out . " It is n't coming in from the sea . This evening it 's a land breeze . " " David said we might be able to fly the glider above the house in a land breeze . He said the wind just goes right up and over our house . " " I never thought of that . Well , run down the street and see if he can spend a half hour consulting with us . " As Amy scampered off , Jake told Toad , " There 's an aviation expert right down the street who is kind enough to offer advice from time to time . " The aviation expert was apparently unoccupied at the moment . He showed up wearing a monster-truck T-shirt bearing the legend " Eat Street . " His shoelaces were untied , his cowlicks fully aroused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully to Jake 's plan . " Sounds to me like it might work , Cap'n , " he said with a sidelong glance at Toad . " Might ding up your plane a little , though . " " I 'll risk it if you 'll fix the damage . " " Callie ! Rita ! " Amy called excitedly . " We 're going to fly . " Jake readied the plane for flight in the front yard under David 's supervision . Eight rubber bands were stretched to hold the six-foot wing to the fuselage . Batteries were tested and inserted , the cover closed , switch on , controls waggled to the full extent of their travel using the radio control box : Amy checked each item after Jake performedit while David briefed Toad on proper launch procedure . In five minutes they were ready for the sky . Toad climbed the ladder from the garage and scaled the sloping roof until he sat perched on the ridgepole with the plane in hand . " Pretty good breeze up here , " he informed the crowd below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you jump off there , Darius Green , " Rita called as ' Toad sucked on a finger and held it aloft . " As you can plainly see , dear wife , I 'm not wearing my wingstonight , " Tarkington replied lightly . He flapped his elbows experi/mentally . " I 'll astonish the nation and all creation , by flyin ' over the celebration ! I 'll dance on the chimneys , I 'll stand on the steeple , I 'll flop up to winders and scare all the people , " ' quoteth he , striking a precarious pose , or trying to , up there on the ridge of the roof with an airplane grasped carefully in his right hand . " Maybe I 'd better alert the emergency room at the hospital , " Callie said , laughing . " Oh , Callie , " Amy groaned . " He 's not going to jump ! Really ! " Toad finished his recitation with a flourish : " ' And I 'll say to the gawpin ' fools below , What world 's this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed the radio control box to David . " You 're up first . Whenever you 're ready . " The youngster centered the control levers and shouted to Toad , " Let ' er go ! " With the gentlest of tosses , Toad laid the glider into the rising air currents . The boy immediately banked left and raised the nose until the aircraft was barely moving in relation to the ground . As it reached the end of the house , he reversed the controls and flew it back the other way . The ship soared upward on the rising current of air . It floated above Toad 's head , back and forth along the peak of the roof , banking gently to maintain position and rising and fallingas the air currents dictated . " All right ! " Toad shouted and began to clap . On the ground the spectators all did likewise . " There 's just enough wind , " Jake told David , grinning broadly . " Now , by God , that 's flying ! " " Awesome , " David agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes , David handed the control box to Jake . He overbanked and the plane lost altitude precipitously , threatening to strike Toad straddling the roof 's ridge . " Keep your nose up , " David advised hurriedly . " You can fly slower than that . " As the glider responded , he continued . " That 's it ! She 's got plenty of camber in those wings and good washout . She 'll fly real , real slow , just riding those updrafts . That 's it ! Let ' er fly . Just sorta urge ' er along . " Ile was right . The plane soared like a living thing , banking and diving and climbing , seeking the rising air and responding willingly . The evening sun flashed on the wings and fuselage and made the little craft brightly lustrous against the darkening blue ofthe sky above.  | " Let Rita try it , " Amy urged . " Do n't you want to ? " " No . Let Rita . " " Come over here , Rita Moravia . " The pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manipulate the controls as he explained what each was . " The thing you got ta watch is that the controls work backwards as you look at the plane head-on . Turn around and fly it by looking over your shoulder . Then left will be left and right will be right . " Rita obediently faced away from the house and looked back over her shoulder . Toad waved . Jake handed her the radio control box . As David and Amy tried to offer simultaneous advice , Rita clumsily swung the plane back and forth and worked the nose hesitantly . She overcontrolled as David groaned , " Not too much , no no no . " But the wind was dying . She got the nose too high trying to maintain altitude : the plane stalled and the nose fell through . The plane shot forward away from the house , toward the street . David scrambled , but Rita stalled it again and the left wing and nose dug into the sandy lawn before the running boy could reach it . The rubber bands let loose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage . " Nasty , " David declared . " My dinner ! " Callie exclaimed , and charged for the door . " You did great for a first solo , " Amy assured Rita . The pilot pulled the girl to her and gave her a mighty hug and a kiss on the cheek . She got a big hug in return . " She ai n't banged up too bad , Cap'n , " David called . Up on the roof Toad was laughing . He blew Rita a kiss . After dinner Callie shooed Jake and Toad off to the screened-in porch while she cleaned up the dishes . Rita and Amy helped . " So what did your parents think of Toad when they met him , or have they yet ? " Callie asked Rita . " We went to visit them two weekends ago . Mother invited a few of their closest friends over to meet the newlyweds . Then she corneredToad , and making sure I was in earshot , she asked him , Now that you 're married , when is Rita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruefully , remembering . " How well do you know Toad ? " she asked Callie . " Not very well . I met him for the first time last year in the Mediterranean . " " Well , he looked at Mother with that slightly baffled , Lord of  |p269the  Turnip Truck expression of his , and said , Why would she do that ? Flying is what she does . ' I could have kissed him right there in front of everyone . " Rita chuckled again . " Does n't your mom want you to fly , " Amy piped , her chin resting on a hand , her eyes fixed on her new heroine . " My mother is one of these new moderns who have elevated the elimination of risk to a religious status . She serves only food certifiedsafe for laboratory rats . She writes weekly letters to congressmenurging a national fifty-five-mile-per-hour speed limit , helmets for motorcyclists , gun control  --  she has never been on a motorcycle in her life and to the best of my knowledge has never even seen a real firearm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since she read an article about how many people per year fall off cliffs or die of hypothermia . This from a woman who regardsa walk across a large parking lot as a survival trek . " " I 'm not afraid of things , " Amy assured Rita . " It 's not fear that motivates Mother . She thinks of government as Super-Mom , and who better to advise the politicians than the superest mom of them all ? " " Flying is risky , inherently dangerous . I can understand your mother 's concern , " Callie said as she rinsed a pot . " Flying is something I 've had to live with . It 's a part of Jake and his life , a big part . But I 've had very mixed emotions about his being grounded . " As she dried the pot she turned to Rita . " You or Toad may be killed or crippled for life in an accident . After it happens , if it happens , it wo n't matter whose fault it is or how good you are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many times . " " Life is risky , " Rita replied . " Life is n't some bland puree with all the caffeine and cholesterol removed . It does n't just go on for ever and ever without end , amen . For every living thing there is a beginning , a middle , and an end . And life is chance . Chance is the means whereby God rules the universe . " The flier thought a moment , then continued , choosing her words carefully . " I have the courage to try to live with my fate , whatever it may be . " " Do you have enough ? " Amy asked , dead serious . " I do n't know , " said Rita . She smiled at the youngster . " I hope so . I have n't needed much courage so far . I 'm healthy , reasonably intelligent , and I 've been lucky . But still , I gather courage where I find it and save it for the storms to come . "  |p270Through  the years Jake Grafton had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like driving through Newport or Beverly Hills . With manicured lawns , trimmed trees , well-kept substantial buildings and nifty painted signs , air force bases made him feel like a poor farm boy visiting the estate of a rich uncle . In contrast , the money the admirals wheedled from a parsimonious Congress went into ships and airplanes . The dedication of a new cinder-block enlisted quarters at some cramped navy base in the industrial district of a major port city was such a rare event that it would draw a half dozen admirals and maybe the CNO . The Tonopah facility , however , did n't look like any air force base Jake had ever seen . It looked like some shacky , jerry-built temporary facility the navy had stuck out in the middle of nowhere during World War II and had only now decided to improve . Perhapsthis base was just too new . Bulldozers and earthmovers sat scattered around on large , open wounds of raw earth . No trees or grass yet , though two trenchers appeared to be excavating for a sprinkler system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumbleweeds swept across the flat , featureless desert and through the stark frames of buildings under construction , and the wind blew most of the time.  |p271Security  was as tight as Jake had ever seen it in the military . Air policemen in natty uniforms with white dickeys at their throats manned the gates and patrolled chain link fences topped with barbed wire while they fought to keep their spiffy blue berets in place against the wind . The fences were woven with metal strips to form opaque barriers . Signs every few yards forbade stopping or photography . You needed a pass to enter any area , and prominent signs vibrating in the wind advised you of that fact . The place reeked with that peculiar aroma of government intrigue : Important , stupendous things are happening here . You do n't want to know ! We who do also know that you could n't handle it . Trust us . In other words , the overall effect was precisely the same gray ambienceof don't-bother-us superiority that oozes from large post officesand the mausoleums that house the departments of motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . Even the sergeant at the desk of the Visiting Officers ' Quarters wanted to see Jake Grafton 's security documents . He made cryptic notations in a battered green logbook and passed them back withoutcomment as he frowned at Helmut Fritsche 's facial hair . After all , did n't Lenin wear a beard ? As he escorted Jake and Fritsche down the hall toward their rooms , Toad Tarkington said , " This place is really dead , Captain . The nearest whorehouse is fifty miles away . " Fritsche groaned . " Tonopah makes China Lake look like Paris after dark , " Tarkingtontold the physicist with relish . " This is as far as you can get away from civilization without starting out the other side . " He lowered his voice . " There 's spies everywhere . The place is crawlingwith ' em . Watch your mouth . Remember , loose lips sink  --  " " Loose lips sink lieutenants , " Jake Grafton rumbled . " Yessir , them too , " Toad chirped . That evening Jake inspected the Consolidated Technologies airplane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was being tended by a small army of engineers and technicians who were busy checking every system , every wire , every screw and bolt and rivet . Adele DeCrescentis watched a man fill in a checklist . Each item was carefully marked when completed . Rita Moravia walked back and forth around the aircraft , looking , probing , asking morequestions of the company test pilot who stood beside ehr . Toadp272Tarkington was in the aft cockpit , going over the radar and computerone more time as a nearby yellow cart supplied electrical power and cooling air . At 9 P.m. they gathered in a large ready room on the second deck of the hangar 's office pod . The room was devoid of furnishingsexcept for one portable blackboard and thirty or so folding chairs . The meeting lasted until midnight . Every aspect of tomorrow 's flight was gone over in detail . Consolidated 's people approved the test profile and agreed on the performance envelope Rita would have to stay within on the first flight . The route of the flight was laid out on a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commander Les Richards . He pointed out the places where ground cameras would be posted . Real-time telemetry from the airplane would be supervised by Commander Dalton Harris . Smoke Judy would fly the chase plane , an F-14 borrowed from NAS Miramar , and a carefully briefed RIO would film the Consolidatedprototype in flight from the F-14 's backseat . After the meeting broke up , Jake Grafton spent another thirty minutes with his staff , then went down to the hangar deck . Only a dozen or so technicians were still on the job . The overhead floods made little gleaming pinpoints where they reflected on the black surface of the Consolidated stealth plane . As he walked , the tiny pinpoints moved along the complex curved surfaces in an unpredictable way . With his face only a foot or so from the skin of the plane , he studied it . The dark material seemed to have an infinite depth , or perhaps it was only his imagination . The outer skin , he knew , was made of a composite that was virtually transparent to radar waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radar-absorbent structure made of syntheticmaterial formed into small hexagonal chambers . The honeycombwas bonded to inner skins of graphite and other strong composites . He touched the airplane 's skin . Smooth and cool . From this angle the curves and smooth junctions of the skin becameart . No wonder the Consolidated people were so proud of their creation . But how would it hold up aboard a ship ? Could it stand the rough handling and salt air and the poundings of cat shots and traps ? Thousands of them ? Would it be easy to fly , within the capabilitiesof the average pilot-not just a superbly trained , giftedp273professional like Rita Moravia , but the average bright lad from Molineor Miami with only three hundred hours of flight time who would have to learn to use this Art Deco sculpture as a weapon ? Five flights . He needed a lot of answers in just a short time . Rita and Toad would have to get them . He walked away musing about Rita 's lack of test experience and wondering if he had made a mistake giving her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the following day problems with the telemetry equipment kept the prototype firmly on the ground . The engineers were still laboringin the sun on a concrete mat where the temperature exceeded a hundred and ten when Jake glanced at his watch and ordered the plane towed back into the hangar . The Soviet satellite would soon be overhead . The hangar 's interior was shady and cool . And since the air force owned it , it was air-conditioned . The next morning , Wednesday , the F-14 took off with a crackingroar that seemed to split the desert apart . Smoke Judy pulled the power off when he was safely airborne and made a dirty turn to the downwind leg . He came drifting down toward the earth parallelingthe runway and stabilized at one hundred feet just as Rita began to roll . The prototype was noticeably quieter , so quiet that its noise was barely audible above the howl of the Tomcat 's engines as Smoke used his throttles to hang the heavy fighter just above the runway as the stealth bird accelerated . When Rita lifted off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her and the sound of the stealth plane was entirely muffled . " Damn quiet , " George Wilson remarked . " About like a Boeing 767 , maybe less . " The low noise level was a direct by-product of burying the exhaust nozzles and tailpipes in the fuselage , shielded from the underside , to reduce the plane 's infrared signature . In the cockpit Rita concentrated on maintaining the selected test profile and getting the feel of the controls . She had spent hours sitting in the cockpit the last few weeks memorizing the position of every switch , knob , and gauge , learning which buttons she needed to press to place information where she wanted it on the M FI ) s , and so even now , minutes into her first flight in the plane , it was familiar . In the backseat Toad was busy with the system . He checkedthe inertial ; it seemed okay . With ring laser gyros , it had not a  |p274single  moving part and was more accurate than any conventional inertial using electromechanical gyros . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would be necessary to fly with the radar off most of the time , and the ring laser inertial would have to keep a very accurate running tally of the plane 's position . The computer was also functioning perfectly . He had encoded the waypoint and checkpoint information onto **26;16342;TOOLONG  --  cardson the ground and loaded them into the computer after engine start . The two-million-dollar pocket calculator , he called it . It hummed right along , belching readouts of airspeed , groundspeed , altitude , wind direction and velocity , true course , magnetic course , drift angle , time to go to checkpoint , etc. , over fifteen readouts simultaneously . He had this information on the right-hand MFD , roughly the location on the panel where it would be in an A-6E . Some of the displays were not yet hooked up since development work was not yet complete . Consequently the three-dimensional information presentations on the pilot 's holographic Heads-Up Displaycould not be tested . The phased-array radar in the nose received Toad 's attention next . The antenna was flat and fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made up of several hundred miniature antennas , individually varying their pulse frequencies to steer or focus the main beam . A conventional radar dish would have acted as a reflectorto send the enemy 's radar signals back to him . Toad tuned the radar to optimize the presentation and dictated his switch and dial positions on the ICS , which , like the radar presentation , was being recorded on tape for later study . The next major pieces of gear he turned on and integrated into the system were , for him , the most interesting . Two new infrared search and tracking systems that were able to distinguish major targetsas far away as a hundred miles , depending upon the aircraft 's altitude and the relative heat value of the target . One could be used for searching for enemy fighters while the other was used to navigate or locate a target on the ground . The range of these sensorswas a tenfold improvement over the relatively primitive IR gear in the A-6E . Since a stealthy attack plane would fly most of its mission with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of the bombardier-navigator . Toad took a second to glance to his left . Smoke had the F-14about a hundred feet away in perfect formation . The backseater'sp275helmet was hidden behind his camera , which was pointed this way . That videotape would show every twitch of the flight control surfaces . Toad turned back to the task at hand . He felt the plane yawing as Rita experimented with the controls and advanced and retarded each throttle independently . She was talking on the radio , telling Smoke what she was doing , reading the engine performance data to the people on the ground so it could be coordinated with the telemetry data , giving her impressions of the feel of the plane . " Seems responsive and sensitive in all axes , " she said . " Engine response is good , automatic systems functioning as advertised . Got a hundred feet a minute more climb than I expected . Fuel flow fifty pounds per hour high . Oil pressure in the green , exhaust gas temps are a hundred high . I like it . A nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 240 at .72 Mach , 420 knots true . Toad checked the range and depression angles of the radar and IR sensors , and ran checks on the inertial and computer . Thirty minutes later , after hitting three navigation checkpoints , Rita dropped the nose two degrees and began a power-on descent back toward Tonopah . She leveled at 5,000 feet at 550 knots and raced toward the field . Smoke Judy was a hundred feet away on the right side , immobile in relation to the stealth bird . In the backseat Toad ran an attack . His target was the hangar that had housed the plane . The system gave Rita steering and time and distance to go to a laser-guided bomb release . Everything functionedas advertised . No weapon was released because the plane carried none , but a tone sounded on the radio and was captured on all the tapes , and it ceased abruptly at the weapons-release point , interrupted by the electronic pulse to the empty bomb rack cunninglyfaired into the airplane 's belly . After three attacks at different altitudes , Rita slowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flaps . She entered the landing pattern . Two fleet Landing Signal Officers that Jake had borrowed from Miramar  --  they had flown the F-14 to Tonopah  --  stood on the end of the runway in a portable radio-equipped trailer that a truck had delivered . They had spent the last three days painting the outline of a carrier deck on the air force 's main runway and rigging a portableOptical Landing System-01 , S-which the truck had also delivered . Now they watched Rita make simulated carrier approaches  |p276flying  the ball , the " meatball , " on the OLS . Jake Grafton stood beside them . " Paddles has you , " the senior man told Rita as she passed the ninety-degree position . One other LSO wrote while the first watched the approach with the radiotelephone transceiver held to his ear and dictated his comments . " On speed , little lined up left , little too much power . . . " The plane swept past and its wheels whacked into the runway , right on the line that marked the target touchdown point . The nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off the runway . The LSO shouted to his writer , " Fair pass . " Jake Grafton stared at the plane in the pattern . It just looks weird , he told himself . The lifting fuselage and invisible intakes and the canards and the black color , it did n't look like a real airplane . Then he knew . It looked like a model . It looked like one of those plastic planes he had glued together and held at arm 's length and marveled at . " You 're carrying too much power in the groove , " the LSO told Rita after the second pass . " I 'm just floating down with the power way back , " she replied . " And we 're hearing a little rumble . Maybe incipient compressor stall . I 'll use the boards next time around . " The Consolidated engineers had thought the speed brakes would be unnecessary in the pattern . Yet with the intakes on top of the plane , behind the cockpit , maybe the air reaching them was too turbulent when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jake Grafton began to chew on his lower lip . The air force does n't land planes like this , he reminded himself . They would n't have tried these maneuvers when they flew the plane . With the boards out the plane approached at a slightly higher nose attitude , its engine noise louder . The speed brakes allowedrequired  --  Ritato come in with a higher power setting . " This feels better , " she commented . " But I 'm still hearing that rumble . Little more pronounced now , if anything . " " Looks better , " the junior LSO told Jake . " I think the boards give her more control . " " **25;16370;TOOLONG sink rate , " Rita reported . Once again the main mounts smacked in with puffs of fried rubber from each tire as it rotated up to speed . The main oleos compressed and the nose slapped down , then she was adding power and pulling thep277After the sixth pass she pulled the throttles back to idle and the plane stayed on the deck . The engine noise was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " one LSO said , grinning . " We 'll have to call this one the Burglar . First we had the Intruder , now the Bur-glar . " " I think it ought to be called the Penetrator , " the senior man said . " ' Yeah , baby , I 'm a Penetrator pilot . ' He cackled at his own wit . When Rita cleared the runway , Smoke Judy called the LSOs . " Since you guys are all set up , how about giving me a couple ? " " If you got the gas , you get the pass , " the LSO radioed . The debriefing took until 9 P.M. with an hour break for dinner . The telemetry data and the videotapes were played and studied . Rita and Toad were each carefully debriefed as a dozen engineers gathered around and the naval officers hovered in the background . The plane was then thoroughly inspected by a team of structural engineers . The simulated carrier landings had placed stresses on the structure that the air force had never anticipated when it developedthe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there was none , but if the plane were to be put into production , strengthening would inevitably be needed . Just where and how much was the concern , and the telemetry data would pinpointthese locations . And some minor equipment problems had surfaced . The Consolidatedtechnicians would work all night to fix those as navy maintenance specialists watched and took notes . The intake rumblein the landing pattern was the most serious problem , and Adele DeCrescentis discussed it on the phone with the people at the Consolidated factory in Burbank for over an hour . All in all , it had been a fine day . Rita and Toad were still going a mile a minute when Jake loaded them all into the vans at 9 P.M. for the room that evening . Someone produced a cold six-pack of beer and they each took a bottle . The day after tomorrow . It 'll all be decided then , " Les Richards , the A-6 bombardier , told the assembled group . " Day after tomorrow we pull some Gs , and I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the navy needs an attack plane for a  |p278low-level  mission that is that G-limited . It 'll get bounced around too much down low , and if a fighter ever spots it or someone pops an IR or optically guided missile , this thing is dead meat . " " What if they beef it up ? " someone asked . " Strengthen the spars and so on ? " " Cut performance too much . More weight . We do n't have a whole lot of performance to begin with . And what if the compressorsstall ? " " Could they enlarge the automatic flaps on the intakes that raise up and scoop more air in when the engines need it ? " " It 'd be turbulent air . We learned today that those two engines like a diet of smooth , undisturbed air . " " Oh no we did n't . " So it went . Jake ran them all out at midnight and collapsed into bed . The following day was spent in further intensive review of the videotapesand telemetry data , and planning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules for op-eval fly-offs , the manufacturer cleared various areas of the flight performanceenvelope for the navy test pilots to explore . Rita wanted to examine the slow-flight characteristics of the aircraft before she proceeded to **27;16397;TOOLONG maneuvers . Consolidated'schief engineer did not want her below 200 knots clean and 120 knots dirty . When Jake joined the conversation , Rita was saying , " I flew the plane at 124 knots yesterday , three o'clock angle of attack . Now , is that 1.3 times the stall speed or is n't it ? How are we supposed to verify the stall speed if we ca n't stall it ? " Jack merely stood and listened . " We 've told you what the stall speed is , " the engineer explained patiently , " at every weight and every altitude and every configuration . Those speeds were established by experimental test pilots . " " Well , I 'm an engineering test pilot  --  all navy test pilots are trained to that standard  --  but I ca n't see how we can do a proper operational evaluation of your airplane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envelope . " The civilian appealed to Jake . " Listen , Captain . This is the only prototype we have . If she drills a deep hole with it , we have big problems . It 'll he goddamn hard to sell an airplane when all wehave is the wreckage . "  | " What makes you think , " Jake asked , " that she ca n't safely recoverfrom a stall ? " " I did n't say that . You 're putting words into my mouth . " " Get DeCrescentis over here . " The chief engineer went off to find her . " We have to stall that plane , Captain , " Rita told him . " If those rumbles in the landing pattern yesterday were incipient compressor stalls , we 'll get some real ones if we get her slowed down enough . I think that 's what Consolidated does n't want us into . " Adele DeCrescentis backed her engineer . Jake heard her out , then said , " I do n't think you people really want to sell this plane to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We sure as hell want it in one piece to sell to somebody . " " Well , I 'll tell you this . We 're going to fly that plane the way I want it flown or we 'll stop this show right now . The navy is n't spending ten million bucks for a fly-off if all we can do is cruise the damn thing down the interstate at fifty-five . We 're trying to find out if that plane can be used to fight with , Ms. DeCrescentis , not profile around the Paris Air Show . " She opened her mouth , but Jake did n't give her a chance . " I mean it ! We 'll fly it my way or we wo n't fly it . Your choice . " She looked about her , opened her mouth , then closed it again . Finally she said , " I 'll have to think about it for a bit . " She wheeled and made a beeline for the Consolidated offices and the phones , the chief engineer trailing after her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Rita suggested . " Nope . " He looked at Rita and grinned . " Captains have to obey orders , of course , but George Ludlow and Royce Caplinger shoved me out in front on this one . They want me to make a recommendationand take the heat , so they sort of have to let me do it my way . " He shrugged . " Generally speaking , doing it your way is not very good for your career , but I 've been to the mat once too often anyway . That 's why I got this job . Ludlow 's a pretty good SECNAV . He understands the navy and the people in it . He would n't send a guy with a shot at flag over to Capitol Hill to get his balls cut off , not if he had any other choice . " Rita looked dubious . " Arc you right about this , Miss Moravia ? " " Yes , sir . I am. "  | " I think so too . So that 's the way we 'll do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When Adele DeCrescentis returned , she agreed with Jake . Apparentlythe president of the company could also read tea leaves . " Go find that Consolidated test pilot , " Jake told Rita when they were alone . " Take him over to the club and buy him a drink . Find out everything he knows about stalling this invisible airplane , off the record . " " Aye aye , sir , " Rita said , and marched off . Cumulus clouds and rain squalls moving through the area from the west delayed the second flight another day , but when she finally got the plane to altitude , Rita attacked the performance envelope with vigor while Smoke Judy in the F-14 hung like glue on first one wing , then the other . Stalls were first . They were almost last . With the nose at ten degrees above the horizon and the power at 70 percent , she let the plane coast into the first one , but did n't get there because the pitty-pat thumping began in the intakes and increased in intensity to a drumming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RPMs dropped on both engines . She could feel vibrations reaching her through the seat and throttles and rudder pedals . Compressor stalls ! Well , that mousy little test pilot for Consolidated had n't been lying . She pushed the nose over , which incidentally worsenedthe thumping from behind the cockpit , and held it there while her speed increased and the noise finally abated , all the while reading the numbers from the engine instruments over the radio . With the engines back to normal , she had another thought . If a pilot got slow and lost power in the landing pattern , on final , this thing could pancake into the ground short of the runway . Aboard ship the technical phrase for that turn of events was " ramp strike . " She smoothly pulled the nose to twenty degrees above the horizonand as her speed dropped began feeding in power until she had the throttles forward against the stops . The airspeed continued to decay . This was " the back side of the power curve , " that flight regime where drag increased so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient power to accelerate the plane . The onset of compressor stall was instanteous and dramatic , a violent hammering from the intakes behind the cockpit that causedp281stalled . It broke crisply and fell straight forward until the nose was fifteen degrees below the horizon , then the canard authority returned . Still the engine compressors were stalled , with EGT going to the red lines and RPM dropping below 85 percent . Rita smartly retarded the throttles to keep the engines from overtemping . The pounding continued . Throttles to idle . EGT above red line . She chopped the throttles to cutoff , securing the flow of fuel to the engines . The pounding ceased . The cockpit was very quiet . Toad remarked later that all he could hear as Rita worked to restart the engines " was God laughing . " This time as Rita approached touchdown , she flared the plane and pulled the throttles aft . Sure enough , the pounding of turbulentair in the intakes began just before the main wheels kissed the runway . She held the nose off and watched the EGT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing stabilator authority , she lowered the nose to the runway and smoothly appliedthe brakes . " Another day , another dollar , " Toad told her on the ICS . Removing the engines from the airplane , inspecting them , inspectingthe intakes and reinstalling the engines took three days , mainly because Jake Grafton demanded that a factory rep look at the compressor and turbine blades with a borescope , which had to be flown in . Consolidated 's chief engineer was livid . He was so furious that he did n't trust himself to speak , and turned away when anyone in uniform approached him . Adele DeCrescentis was equally outraged , but she hid it better . She listened to Rita and reviewed the telemetryand videotapes and grunted when Jake Grafton spoke to her . The navy personnel left the Consolidated employees to their misery . " We 're wasting our time flying that bird again , " Les Richards and George Wilson told Jake . " It 's unsat and there is no possible fix that would cure the problem . The whole design sucks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Well , look at it . At high angles of attack the intakes are blanked off by the cockpit and the shape of the fuselage , that aerodynamicShane . How i-ould they fix it ? "  | " Goddamn , I 'm not an aeronautical engineer ! How the hell would I know ? " " Well , I am , " Wilson said , " and they ca n't . " " Never say never . Regardless , we 're going to fly this bird five times . I do n't want anyone to say that we did n't give Consolidated a fair chance . " " We 're wasting our time and the navy 's money . " " What 's a few million ? " Jake asked rhetorically . The real objectivewas to get money for an acceptable airplane from Congress . So he was philosophical . Toad Tarkington slipped down the hall to his wife 's room when he thought everyone else was in bed . They had been running a lowprofileromance since they arrived in Tonopah . " Tell me again , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said about stalls when you pumped him . What 's his name ? " " Stu Vinich . He just said they had had some compressor-stall problems at high angles of attack . " " Nothing else ? Nothing about how serious they were ? " " He could n't , Toad . The company was downplaying the whole subject . People who talk out of school draw unemployment checks . " " We were damned lucky that thing did n't spin . And we were lucky the engines relit . " " Luck is a part of the job , " Rita told him . " Yeah . If we had punched and our chutes had n't opened , Vinich would have just stood at our graves and shook his head . " " He said enough . I knew what to expect . " Toad turned out the light and snuggled down beside her . Jake Grafton was poking and prodding the plane , trying to stay out of the technicians ' way , when he noticed Adele DeCrescentis watching him . He walked over . " You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a twelve-ton Swiss watch . " " A quartz watch , " the vice president said . " Yeah . Anyway , I was wondering . Just how hard would it be foryour folks to put a twenty-millimeter cannon on this plane ? " " A gun ? She appeared dumbfounded , as if the idea had neveroccurred to her . " Uh-huh . A gun . A little Gatling , snuggled inside the fuselagewith five hundred rounds Or so . What do you think ? "  | " When we were designing this plane , not a single , solitary air force officer ever even breathed the word ' gun . ' " Somehow that does n't surprise me . But would it be feasible ? " " With some fairly major design changes , which will cost a good deal of money , I suppose it might be . It would take a full-blown engineering study to determine that for sure . But why ? A machine like this ? You want it down in the weeds dueling with antiaircraft guns ? Shooting at tanks ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't be able to shoot million-dollar missiles at all of ' em . The Warsaw Pact has over fifty thousand tanks . A nice little twenty-millimeter with armorpiercingshells would be just the right prescription . " Senator Hiram Duquesne was not philosophical when he telephonedGeorge Ludlow . " You keeping up on what 's going on out in Tonopah ? " he thundered . " Well , I get reports from Vice Admiral Dunedin . Captain Grafton reports to him several times a day . " " I want to know why the officer in charge out there insisted on performing maneuvers that the manufacturer did not feel the plane was ready for , or safe to perform . " " He 's doing an op eval . He knows what he 's doing . " " Oh does he ? He 's got a twenty-five-year-old woman with no previous test experience flying that plane , a **35;16426;TOOLONG ! " " She 's not twenty-five . She 's twenty-seven . " " Have you seen her ? " " What do you mean ? " " I mean what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of people have a lot riding on the outcome of this fly-off . And you got Bo Derek 's little sister out there flying the planes ! Is she the best test pilot you people have ? My God , we 've been spending millions for that Test Pilot School in Pax River  --  is she the best you 've got ? " " If you have any information that implies she 's incompetent , I 'd like to hear it . " " I hear she intentionally shut down both engines while she was up in the sky . Now Consolidated is spending a ton checking them for damage . I 'll bet Chuck Yeager never shut down both engines on a test flight at the same time ! " " I would n't know . You 'd have to ask the air force . "  | " Do n't get cute . I 'm serious . Dead serious . Do n't let that hero fly-boy Grafton and his bimbo test pilot screw this up , George . I 'm warning you . " Thanks . " " By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrier you guys want to start ? My committee voted this morning to delete it . Maybe next year , huh ? " The senator hung up before Ludlow could respond . Jake Grafton changed Rita 's test profile for the last three flights . He had her avoid all high-angle-of-attack maneuvers , though he did let her ease toward the advertised five-G limit , where the airflow to the engines once again became turbulent and began to rumble . The three flights took another ten days . When they were finished the navy crowd spent three more days correlating their data and talking to Consolidated engineers , then packed up for the return to Washington . It would be three weeks before they came back to fly the TRX prototype . On their last night in Tonopah the navy contingent threw a party in the officers ' club for a very subdued group from Consolidated . Adele DeCrescentis did n't attend , which was perhaps just as well . Along toward midnight , after Toad Tarkington had enjoyed the entire salubrious effect of alcohol and had begun the downhill slide , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some woman from Consolidated 's avionics division . He strolled over , tapped Vinich on the shoulder , and as the test pilot turned , flattenedhim with one roundhouse punch.  |p285Jake  Grafton was amazed when he saw Amy at the passenger terminal at Andrews Air Force Base . In the three weeks he had been gone the child had visibly grown . " Hi , Jake , " she warbled , and ran to throw her arms around him . " Miss me ? " he asked . " Not as much as Callie did , " was the sophisticated reply . As he and Callie waited for the luggage to be off-loaded from the airplane , Callie visited with the other officers who had ridden the DC-9 from Tonopah . Jake made a fuss over Amy and teased her a little , causing her cheeks to redden . But she stayed right there beside him , saying hello to everyone and smiling broadly when spoken to . " So how 'd it go ? " Callie asked him as they walked to the car . Jake shrugged . Everything was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I stopped going to Dr. Arnold . Last Friday was my last appoint-ment . " Jake set his luggage on the pavement and gave her a tight squeeze as Amy skipped on ahead , her black hair bobbing with every bound . Callie looked happier than Jake had seen her in a long , long time.  |p286The  next morning , a Tuesday , he spent closeted with Admiral Dunedin going over the test results . They watched videotapes and looked at numbers , and began writing down tentative conclusions . " So how did Moravia do ? " the admiral asked at one point . " Fine . Good stick , keeps her wits about her , knows more aeronauticalengineering than I even knew existed . " " So you want to keep her for the TRX bird ? " " No reason not to . " The admiral told him about the conversation Senator Duquesne had had with George Ludlow . " The secretary did n't tell me to fire her , or keep her , or anything else , " Dunedin concluded . " He just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand this , Admiral . Duquesne 's committeedeleted the appropriation for reactors for the new carrier from this year 's budget . Is he implying that if we get another test pilot he 'll put it back in ? " " No . I think the message is that unless the navy buys the Consolidatedplane , he 's not going to be  --  he 'll be less enthusiastic about navy budget requests . " " Sir , I do n't think Consolidated 's plane can be modified enough to meet the mission requirements for a new attack plane . And you have to factor Athena into the equation . With Athena we wo n't need to buy all that expensive stealth stuff on every airplane . " " Fly the TRX plane . Then we 'll see . " " Do you want me to get another test pilot ? " " I just wanted you to understand what 's going on . The temperatureis rising . Ludlow and all the politicos in SECDEF 's office are playing politics right along with everyone else in this town . The admirals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's that merry time of year . " " I think we have to keep Moravia . After she 's flown both planes she can make point-by-point comparisons that ca n't be questioned for extraneous reasons . Consolidated will beat us to death with Rita 's corpse if we use another test pilot to fly the TRX plane , and then recommend it instead of theirs . They 'll claim they got shafted by an incompetent , inexperienced pilot . You and I will look like blundering idiots , or worse . " " I agree , " the admiral said . Proposals from contractors were arriving based on the navy 's Requestfor Proposal ( RFP ) on the Athena project . The afternoon wasp287devoted to examining these documents , which were as thick as metropolitan telephone directories . " How come these guys ca n't just say what they want to say and leave it at that ? " " Lawyers wrote these . " " I ca n't make head or tail of some of this stuff . They 've used every acronym in the book and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispatches from Babel . " One morning several days later Dreyfus stuck his head in Luis Camacho 's office door . " The Minotaur mailed the Russians anotherletter . " Dreyfus handed Camacho a copy and sank into a chair while his boss perused it . Addressed to the Soviet ambassador , the letter was a commentary on Gorbachev 's recent visit to Cuba . The last paragraphcontained some advice on how the Soviets should handle Castro . " On generic copy paper , as usual . Just like all the others . " " Has the original been through the lab yet ? " " Nope . I just took it down . " " Go get it . I want to see it . " " What for ? That 's an accurate copy . " " Please . Now . " With a shake of his head , Dreyfus complied . Camacho opened his desk drawer and pulled out a pair of rubber gloves , which he worked onto his hands without the benefit of baby powder . Then he extracted a jar from the lower left drawer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smear a little of the blue jelly on his desk . Oops , too much . He used a piece of paper from a legal pad to blot the mess , then stared at the stain on the back of the paper . After firmly closing the jar , he stowed it back in his desk . When Dreyfus returned with the letter , Camacho was at the window idly watching the pedestrians on E Street . He gingerly opened the plastic bag and extracted the letter while Dreyfus watched openmouthed . He laid the fully opened letter on the desk and pressed . Then he turned it over and examined the blue smear on the back . Satisfactory . Not too much , yet enough for the lab to get a sample . He refolded the letter and replaced it in the seethroughplastic hag . ' Take it back to the lab . " " Did I see that ? "  | " No . You are as ignorant as you look . " " You 're the boss . " " Indeed . And while you 're at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Camacho seized a piece of scratch paper and carefully printed a word . " Kilderkin . " He passed the paper to Dreyfus . " Anything else ? " Dreyfus asked hopefully . " Like what ? " " Oh , I du n no . I 've got the feeling that neat and wonderful wheels are turning like crazy , though I have n't the foggiest idea why . Or where the wheels will take us . " " What do you want ? A Tuesday-morning miracle ? " " It does n't have to be a miracle . A tiny little sleight of hand would be welcome . Or a very brief explanation . " Camacho shot his cuffs . " See . Nothing up my sleeves . No hat , so no rabbit . " Dreyfus stood and ambled toward the door . " Kilderkin , huh ? You know , I get the impression that  --  " " Never trust your impressions . Wait for evidence . " " So what do we do with the original letter when the lab 's through with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The usual . Stick it back in its envelope and let the post office deliver it . I 'm sure the ambassador will convey the writer 's advice to the members of the Politburo at his earliest opportunity . This may be the great watershed in U.S.-Soviet re  --  " He stopped becauseDreyfus was already out the door and had closed it behind him . At ten o'clock Dreyfus was back . He waited patiently until Camacho was off the phone , then said . " Okay , how 'd you know ? " " Know what ? " " That that antique word from merry of England would crack it ? " " Kilderkin ? " " Yeah . " " Elementary , my dear Watson . A kilderkin is a barrel or cask . It contains something , as that letter did . " " Shit . " Camacho extended his hand . Dreyfus passed him a small piece of white paper containing the three words from the message and waited while he examined it . The second word was " kilderkin . " " That 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small nave and stuck it into his shirt nocket . " ' Thanks . "  | " Always a pleasure , Holmes . " When he was again alone , Camacho dialed a telephone number from memory and identified himself to the woman who answered . In a moment the person he wanted was on the line and he said , " Let 's have lunch . " " Ca n't today . Pretty busy . " " Appointments ? " " Yep . " " Cancel them . " " Where and when ? " " On the mall , in front of the Air and Space Museum . Twelve or so . The line went dead in Camacho 's ear . He cradled the instrument . He leaned back in his chair and looked out his little window at the buildings on the other side of E Street . He pursed his lips and , breathing deeply in and out , gently massaged his head with one hand . An hour later he was out on the sidewalk in his shirt sleeves , striding along . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket and tie over the back of his chair . He was violating FBI policy but so be it . The summer heat was palpable , a living , breathing monster no doubt goaded by the sheer numbers of humanswho were defying it this midday . Where did all these people come from ? The streets were packed with cars , taxis , snorting buses and trucks , the sidewalks covered with swarming humanity . Overhead the summer haze made the sky appear a gauzy , indistinctwhite , but it failed to soften the sun 's fierce glare . Camacho 's shirt wilted swiftly and glued itself to the small of his back . He could feel the perspiration soaking into his socks . Little beads of sweat congealed around the hairs on the back of his hands , and he automatically wiped the palms on his trousers as he walked . Every shady circle under the mall trees was home to office workersand tourists who could no longer stay on their feet . Children sprawled and played on the hard-packed dirt . The grass that had grown under the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact of infinite feet . An endless stream of joggers and serious runners pounded up and down the gravel paths of the mall , little dust spurts rising from the thud of each foot . The combined effect was a thin brown curtain of dust that rose into the air and tilted away toward the monolithic art museums that linedthe northern side of the open expanse.  |p290The  street in front of the Air and Space Museum was bumper to bumper with tour buses . As he came closer , Luis Camacho threaded his way through the hordes of teenagers and middle-aged pink people in shorts and cutesy T-shirts . The great American sightseeing excursion was in full swing . Herds of Japanese tourists clad in the requisite button-down short-sleeved shirts clustered near some of the buses and busily snapped their cameras at each other , the huge windowless museums to the north , the distant Washington Monument and the dome of the Capitol rising in the east like a corpulent moon . In spite of the oppressive heat , the mood was cheerful , gay . Camacho found a spot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cigarette butts and candy-bar wrappers littered the ground . He did n't care . To his left a souvenir stand was doing a land-office business in film , soft drinks and ice-cream bars . Squallingyoungsters and frisky youths queued like soldiers in the sun as they waited for their turn to surrender their money to the happy merchant . Derelicts shuffled slowly through the human forest . They were blithely ignored as they mined the trash bins for pop cans . A couple of alkies snoozed further away from the street in the shade cast by the treetops , out where the grass still survived : their day had apparently ended some hours ago when the critical intoxication level had been reached and surpassed . He had been there no more than five minutes when he spotted the man he had come to meet feeling his way through the crowd , looking about him . Camacho stood and walked toward him . " Morning , Admiral . " " Let 's get the hell out of this crowd , " Tyler Henry growled . " Next time pick a quieter spot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pullover with a little fox on the right breast . His eyes were hidden behind the naval aviator 's de rigueur sunglasses . " Aye aye , sir . " The two men walked east , toward the duck pond at the base of Capitol Hill . When they were out of earshot of the tourists and drunks , Henry said , " Okay . I have n't got much time today . What d' ya want ? " " We intercepted another letter from the Minotaur this morning . Thought you 'd be interested . Here 's the coded message it contained . " The FBI agent passed him the little square of words with the three words penciled on it.  |p291Admiral  Henry stopped dead and stared at the words on the paper . " Kilderkin . Holy fuck ! The damned Minotaur is giving away Athena ! " " Yes . " " Awww , goddamn ! Awww ... " Camacho gingerly removed the paper from the admiral 's fingers , refolded it and put it in his pocket . " And I suppose you assholes with badges just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the postman ? " When he saw Camacho 's silent nod , Henry scuffed angrily at the dirt . He indulged himself in some heavy cussing . " Do you know what Athena is ? Do you silly half-wit peepers have any idea what the hell Athena is all about ? " " Well , you said  --  " " I know what I told you ! I 'm asking if any of your superiors have even the slightest glimmer how valuable Athena is . " " I do n't know . " The admiral gestured hugely in exasperation . " Just what in the name of God is going on , Luis ? " They had reached the edge of the duck pond . Camacho stood with folded arms and gazed across the placid surface , past the statue of U.S. Grant on horseback , at the imposing edifice of the Capitol building . " I can only guess , " he said softly . " But do they have any idea what Athena is  --  just what the hell they are giving away ? " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't fiber optics , or ring laser gyros , or any of that other magic shit they 've been letting the Minotaur cart out of the vault .. Athena is the Hope Diamond , the mother lode , the most precious , priceless treasure in the vault . Do those stupid , ignorant , incompetent , half-wit political pimps have even the faintest glimmer what it is the Minotaur just laid his filthy hands on ? " I do n't know ! " " Athena will make radar obsolete . Inevitably it will become cheaper and we 'll be able to miniaturize it , get it so small and cheap we can use it to hide tanks and jeeps , not just ships and airplanes . We can hide satellites with it . In ten years or so we can probably hide submarines with it . Athena will revolutionize strategy , tactics , weaponry . And we 've got it ! The Russians do n't ! Yet ! If we can keep them from getting it for just a couple years  --  just a couple years  --  I tell you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that war will become a political and militaryimpossibility . War will be impossible ! " " I believe you . " " Then why ? Tell me that ! Why ? " Camacho shrugged . " What could be so goddamn valuable that they would bet the ranch , the nation , the future of mankind ? " " I do n't know for sure , and I could n't tell you if I did . " The admiral exploded . Thirty-some years in the navy had really taught him how to swear . Camacho did n't think he had ever heard such a virtuoso performance . Finally Henry stopped spluttering . Bitterness had replaced his exasperation . " I think there 's some treason going on over in your shop , Camacho . That 's all it could be . " " Better go easy with that word . " " Treason . " Henry spit it out . " Do n't like it , huh ? By God , if Congress gets hold of this , that may be the kindest word those slimy spook bastards ever hear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see . " Camacho lost his temper . " I showed you that piece of paper so you could take some reasonable steps to protect Athena , you swabbie , " he snarled . " Like change the code or empty the file . Not so you could shoot your mouth off about things you know nothing about , things that will ruin you and me . Now I 've heard all the crap from you that I 'm gon na listen to . I 've heard enough . One more crack out of line and I 'll come get you with a national security warrant and you can sit in a padded cell at St. Elizabeth 's until I think it 's safe to let you out . That may be when you 're a corpse . Is that what you want ? " " No , " said Tyler Henry contritely , aware that he had gone too far . " Just one word , Admiral , just one little slip by you , and I 'll come after you with that goddamn warrant . You 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declining years together . " Camacho wheeled and walked away , leaving Henry standing there staring at his retreating back.  |p293Tyler  Henry accompanied the ATA project crew when they returned to Tonopah in July . The admiral shook hands with the TRX engineers and spent three hours inspecting the plane , which occupied the hangar where the Consolidated bird had rested , and asking questions . At his request Rita Moravia and Toad Tarkington remained beside him . Many of his questions were directed at Rita , but when he wanted to know something about the navigation/attack system , he asked Toad . " Is that right , Franks ? " the admiral growled at the TRX program manager after he had listened carefully to one of Toad 's answers . Harry Franks nodded his assent . It looked to Jake as if Franks had lost ten pounds or so , but the cotton of his colorful sport shirt still seemed loaded near its tensile strength where it stretched over his middle . Franks rolled the stump of a dead cigar from one corner of his mouth to the other and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his genial air of self-assuranceand command , Franks reminded Jake of the salty chief petty officers he had grown to respect and admire when he was a junior officer . Franks certainly was no modern naval officer or chief in mufti , not with that gut . In today 's navy even the chief petty officers were slimmed down or retired , victims of rigid weight standardsenforced with awesome zeal . The senior admirals liked top294think of their service as a lean , mean fighting machine , which of course it was not . More accurately , the navy was a host of skinny technocrats . Not only were most sailors technicians , most of the officers spent the vast majority of their professional lives as administrators , experts on instructions , notices , regulations , and budgets . The bureaucracy was mean but certainly not lean . Confusing , Jake mused , glancing once again at Franks 's portico , very confusing . Unlike the trendy and not so trendy humans who stood admiring it , TRX 's prototype was exquisite functionality . The mission was all-weather attack . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrier , in any weather day or night , to penetrate the enemy 's defenses , find and destroy the target without outside aid , and return to the tiny ship in the vast ocean from whence it came , there to be refueled and rearmed and launched again . Every form and feature had been carefully crafted for the rigid demands of this mission , and no other . As he stood listening to the engineers describe their creation , Jake Grafton 's eye fell on Rita Moravia and Toad Tarkington , two intelligent young people in perfect health with good educations . They and others like them would have to use this machine as a weapon , when and if . The technocrats would build it and take it to sea . Yet the plane would never be anything but a cunning collection of glue , diodes , and weird alloys . The attack must come from the hearts of those who rode it down the catapult into the sky . The important things in war never change . As always , victory would go to those who prepared wisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grim , fierce determination . When the F-14 chase plane was safely airborne , Rita Moravia smoothly advanced the throttles to the stops and let the two improvedF404 engines wind up to full power as she checked the trim setting one more time . The cockpit noise level was higher than in the Consolidated plane , and no doubt the roar of the engines outsidewas also louder . The exhausts had not been as deeply inset above the wing and cooled as extensively with bypass air from the compressors ; consequently more of the engine 's rated power was available to propel the plane through the atmosphere . And the noise was not the only clue : she could feel slightly more vibration and a perceptibly greater dip of the nose as the thrust of thescreaming engines compressed the nose-gear oleo.  | " Anytime you 're ready , " Toad announced . After dictating all the engine data onto the audio recorder wired into the ICS , Rita released the brakes . The nose oleo rebounded and the plane rolled smartly , picking up speed . The little thumps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runway came quicker and quicker . The needle on the airspeed indicator came off the peg . On the holographicHeads-Up Display  --  the HUD  --  functioning in this prototype , the symbology came alive . The sound of the engines dropped in volume and pitch as the machine accelerated . Now the weight came off the nose wheel as the stabilator and living wing controls took effect and began to exert aerodynamic force on the nose , trying to lift it from the runway . Oh yes . With the joystick held ever so lightly in her fingers , she felt the nose wheel bobble , skip lightly , then rise from the concrete as the wings gripped the air . The master warning light illuminated  --  bright yellow  --  and besidethe HUD the right engine fire warning light  --  brilliant blood red . She smoothly pulled both throttles to idle , then secured the right one . Nose held off until the main mounts were firmly planted , decelerating nicely , speed brakes and flaperon pop-up deployed , five thousand feet of concrete remaining , slowing .. . " Ginger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fire light , right engine , roll the truck . " Nose wheel firmly on the concrete , Rita applied the brakes with a firm , steady pressure : She rolled to a stop and killed the remainingengine as she opened the canopy . The fire truck charged toward them . Rita pulled her helmet off . " Any fire ? " she shouted at the man on the truck as the engine noise died . Without conscious effort , her fingers danced across the panels turning off everything . " Not that we can see . " " Let 's get out anyway , " Rita told Toad , who had already toggledhis quick-release fittings and was craning out of the rear cockpit , looking for smoke . Standing beside the runway , perspiring profusely as the summer desert sun cooked them , Rita and Toad heard the news five minutes later from Ilarry Franks . A swarm of technicians already had the engine bay doors open . " Electrical problem , I 'm sure . We 'll tow it into the hanear and check it out . Nice abort " ht. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to ride back in the van ? It 's air-conditioned . " " Yep , " said Tarkington . " Nothing like air force hospitality . " They flew the plane for the first time the following day . Rita came back from the flight with a large smile on her face . " Captain , " she told Jake Grafton as she brushed sweat-soaked hair from her forehead and eyes , " that 's one sweet machine . Power , handling , plenty of G available , sweet and honest . A very nice airplane . " Before Harry Franks 's grin could get too wide , she started detailingproblems : " Controls are oversensitive . Twitchy . Flying the ball is a real challenge . The left generator dropped off the line twice , which was maybe a good thing , because we found the power relay works as advertised ; the inertial stayed up and humming . Toad got the computer running again without any problem each time . And the rudder trim ... " When Rita paused for air , Toad chimed in . " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work with someone , one more time . I 'm still trying to figure out how ... " The routine was exactly like it had been a month before . Telemetry , videotapes and the Flight Data Recorder info were carefully reviewed and the data compiled for a later in-depth analysis . Those problems that could be fixed were , and major problems were carefullydelineated for factory study . Jake Grafton demanded all his people quit work at 9 P.m . He wanted them rested and back at the hangar at six each morning . Harry Franks worked his technicians around the clock in shifts , although he himself put in eighteen-hour days and was on call at night . Toad tried to get out of the hangar as often as possible . The air force was using this field for stealth fighters  --  F-117s  --  and several other low-observable prototypes , including the B-2 . Every so often if he was outside he would hear a rumble and there , before his very eyes , would be some exotic shape that seemed to defy the laws of gravity and common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt vaguely guilty , and slightly naughty . To satisfy his idle curiosityhe was seeing something that the Powers That Be  --  Those Who Knew  --  the Appointed , Anointed Keepers of the Secret  --  did n't think his little mind should he burdened with . So he stood and gawked , curious and mystified , a little boy at the knotholewatching the love rites of the groping teenagers . He would go backp297to work shaking his head and trot outside again , hopefully , several hours later . He bumped into Jake Grafton on one of these excursions . The captain stood with his hands in his pockets watching a pair of F-117s come into the break . " Amazing , huh ? " Jake said . " Yes , sir . " " I 've been flying for twenty-five years , " Grafton said , " and readingeverything I could about planes for ten more . And all this time I never even dreamed ... " " I know what you mean . It 's like science and technology have gone crazy in some kind of souped-up hothouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize the offspring . " " And it 's not just one technical field . It 's airframes and engines , composites and glues , fabricating techniques , Computer-Assisted Design , avionics and computers and lasers and radars . It 's everything ! In five years everything I learned in a lifetime will be ob-solete . " Or less than five years , Jake told himself glumly as the batwingedB-2 drifted quietly overhead . Maybe everything I know is obsolete now ! When Toad Tarkington thought about it afterwards , he remembered the sun . It was one of those little details you notice at the time and do n't think about , yet remember later . He had seen the sun many times before in the cockpit , bright and warm and bathing everything in a brilliant , clean light , its beams darting and dancing across the cockpit as the plane turned and climbed and dived . A clean light , bright , oh so bright , warming bodies encased in Nomex and sweating inside helmets and gloves and flying boots . This was part of flying , and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a few seconds that morning he did notice it . The memory of it stayed with him , and somehow , lookingback , it seemed important . He was deep into the mysteries of the radar and computer and how they talked to each other , acutely aware of how little time aloft he had . The radar 's picture was automatically recorded on videotape , but he muttered into the ICS  --  the audio track of the tape  --  like a voodoo priest so he would know later just what the gain and brightness had been for each particular presentation . liep298Rita concentrated on flying the plane , on keeping it precisely on speed and on altitude , exactly where the test profile required . She was extraordinarily good at this type of flying , Toad had discovered . She had the knack . It required skill , patience and selfdisciplineas one concentrated on the task at hand to the exclusion of everything else , all qualities Rita Moravia possessed in abundance . The airspeed needle stayed glued on the proper number and all the other needles did precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were slaves to Rita 's iron will . Toad also kept track of their position over the earth , and every now and then wasted three seconds on a glance over at the chase plane . Still there , precisely where it should be . Smoke Judy was a no-nonsense , Sierra Hotel pilot who had almost nothing to say on the radio ; he knew how busy Rita and Toad were . Periodically Toad reminded Rita of which task was next on the list . He could just see the top of her helmet , partially masked by the top of her ejection seat , if he looked straight ahead . He could also see the upside-down reflection of her lap and arms in the canopy , weirdly distorted by the curvature . Her hand on the stick  --  he could see that because in this plane the control stick was where it should be , between the pilot 's legs . And the sun . He saw the brilliance of the sun 's gaze as the sublimelight played across the kneeboard on his right thigh and back and forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How 's control response ? " he asked . " Better . " In a moment she added , " Still not right , though . " He would never have known it from the sensations reaching him through the plane . The ride was smooth as glass . " I told Orville and Wilbur they were wasting their time . They would n't listen . " " What 's next ? " She already knew , of course . She had prepared the flight profile . To humor her , Toad consulted his copy . " High-G chandelles . " " Okay . " He felt the surge as the power increased . Rita wasted no time . He saw her glance at Smoke Judy , assuring herself the F-14 was clear , then the left wing sagged gently as the nose began to rise and the G increased . The G came on in a steadily rising grunt as the horizon tilted crazily . Rita was flying the G line on the holographicHUD . Toad temporarily abandoned his radar research and strained every muscle in the classic M-1 maneuver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he forced air in and out pastp299his lips . The inflatable pads in his G suit had become giant sausages , squeezing his legs to keep the blood from pooling there . This maneuver was designed to allow Rita to explore the limits of G and maneuverability at ever-changing airspeeds . Toad felt the nibble of the stall buffet , and for the first time felt the wings rock sloppily , almost as if Rita were fighting to control their position . " I 'm having some troub  --  " she said , but before she could complete the thought the plane departed . The down wing quit flying and the upper wing flopped them over inverted . The plane began to gyrate wildly . Positive Gs mashed them for half a second , then negative Gs threw them up against their harness straps , but since the airplane was inverted , it was upward toward the earth . The airplane spun like a lopsided Frisbee , bucking up and down madly as the Gs slammed them , positive , negative , positive , negative . The ride was so violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Inverted spin , " he gasped over the ICS . " The controls  --  it wo n't  --  " Rita sounded exasperated . " You 're in an inverted spin , " Toad heard a hard , calm male voice say . Smoke Judy on the radio . " I 'm  --  the controls  --  " " Twenty-nine thousand . . . twenty-eight . . . " By a supreme effort of will Toad made himself concentrate on the altimeter and read the spinning needles . " Spin assist , " he reminded her . This switch would allow the horizontal stabilator its full travel , not restricted by its high-speed limited throw . The danger was if the pilot pulled too hard at high speed without the mechanical limit , the tail might be ripped away . Right now Rita needed all the help she could get to pull the nose down . " It 's on . " " Twenty-five thousand . " He was having trouble staying conscious . The ride was vicious , violent beyond description . His vision closed in until he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was passing out . " Twenty-two , " he croaked . Miraculously the violent pitching action of the nose decreased and he felt as if he were being thrown sideways . As the G decreased , his vision came hack . Rita had them out of the spin and diving . She had the power hack , about 80 percent or so . She rolledthe plane upright and the G came on steadily as she pulled to getp300them out of their rocketing dive . " Okay , " she whispered , " okay , baby , come to Mama . " The wings started rocking again as the G increased , and Toad opened his mouth to shout a warning . Too late . The right wing slammed down and the plane rolled inverted again . " Spin , " was all he could get out . He fought the slamming up and down . " Seventeen thousand ... " " Rita , you 'd better eject . " The hard , fast voice of Smoke Judy . " I 've got it , " Rita shouted on the radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toad . She had the nose coming steadily down now , that yawning sensation again as she fed in full rudder . " Fifteen grand , " Toad advised . They were running out of sky . " It 's the controls ! I 've  --  " " Thirteen ! " She was out of the spin now , upright , but the nose was still way low , seventy degrees below the horizon . Power at idle , she deployedthe speed brakes and began to cautiously lift the nose . " Eleven thousand . " " Come on , baby . " " Ten . " The ground was horribly close . Their speed was rapidly building , even with the boards out and engines at idle . The ground elevation here was at least four thousand feet above sea level , so they were within six thousand feet of the ground , now five , still forty degrees nose down . They would make it . Rita added another pound of back pressure to the stick . The left wing snapped down . Toad pulled the ejection handle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was tumbling , then he was n't , now hurling toward the earth  --  an earth so close he could plainly see every rock and bush  --  and cursing himself for the fool that he was for waiting so long . Lazily , slowly , as if time did n't matter , the seat kicked him loose with a thump . The ground was right there , racing up at him . He closed his eyes . He was going to die now . So this is how it feels . . . A tremendous shock snapped through him , almost ripping his boots off . The opening shock of the parachute canopy . The ground was right there ! He swung for another few seconds ,  |p301then  smashed into a thicket of brush . Too late he remembered he should have protected his head . He came to rest in the middle of an opaque dust cloud . He was conscious through it all . He wiggled his limbs experimentally . Still in one piece , thank the Lord ! Rita ! Where was Rita ? He was standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trying to see . He tore at his Koch fittings . There ! Rid of the chute . Striding out of the brush , almost falling , looking . Another dust cloud . Several hundred yards away and down the hill slightly . Something had impacted there . Rita ? But there was no chute visible . Mother of God ! He began to run.  |p302You  still here ? " the doctor asked when he saw Toad leaning against the counter at the nurses ' station . The doctor was about forty and clad in a loose green hospital garment with tennis shoes on his feet . " How is she ? " " Unconscious . " The doctor swabbed the perspiration from his forehead with his sleeve . " I do n't know when she 'll come around . I do n't know if she ever will . " " What 's wrong with her ? " Toad demanded , grasping the doctor by the arm . " Everything . " He patiently pried Toad 's hand loose . " Her spleen exploded . Fractured skull with severe concussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribs , busted collarbone , two fractured vertebrae . That 's just the stuff we know about . We 're still looking . " " She hit the ground before her parachute opened , " Toad explained . " The drag chute was out and the main chute must have been partially deployed . She just needed another hundred feet or so . " Her status is extremely unstable . " The doctor took out a pack of cigarettes and lit one . " I do n't know how she 's made it this long . " He flipped the ash on the floor , right in front of the Nop303Smoking sign . " The average person would n't have made it to the hospital . But she 's young and she 's in great shape , good strong heart . Perhaps , just perhaps . . . " He took a deep drag and exhaledthe smoke through his nose , savoring it . " Is she gon na be able to fly again ? " Toad wanted to know . The doctor took a small portable ashtray from his pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more deep drags . He looked Toad over carefully before he spoke . " I do n't think you heard what I said . She 'll be lucky if she lives . Walking out of this hospital will be a miracle . There 's nothing you can do for her . Now why do n't you go back to the Q and take one of those sleeping pills the nurse gave you . You need to get some rest . " The doctor turned away from Toad and leaned his elbows on the counter of the nurses ' station . " When you get Lieutenant Moravia'semergency data sheet from the navy , let me know . We 'll have to notify her next of kin . They may want to fly out here to be with her . " Toad smacked the waist-high counter with his hand . " I am her next of kin . She 's my wife . " " Oh , " he said , looking Toad over again , then rubbing the back of his neck . " Sorry . I did n't know that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . I 'll sit in the chair . " The doctor opened his mouth , closed it and glanced at the nurses , then shrugged . " Sure , Lieutenant . Okay . Why not ? " Thirty minutes later Jake Grafton stuck his head into the room . He looked at Rita , the two nurses , the doctor , the IV drips and the heart monitor , then motioned to Toad , who followed him out into the hall . " How is she ? " " She 's in a deep coma . She may die . " Tarkington repeated what the doctor had told him . Jake Grafton listened carefully , his face expressionless . When " Toad finally ran down , he said , " C'm on . Let 's go find a place to sit . " They ended up in the staff lounge in plastic chairs at the only table , between a microwave oven and a pop machine . " What happenedout there today ? " " Toad 's recapitulation of the flight took thirty minutes . After he had heard it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon , Jake had questions , lots of them . They had been talking for over an hour when a young enlistedp304man opened the door and stuck his head in . " Captain Grafton ? There 's an Admiral Dunedin on the phone for you . " " Tell him I 'll be right there . " On the way down the hall he told Toad , " You go check on Rita . I 'll see you in a bit . " The phone was in the duty officer 's office . Jake held it to his ear as the air force officer , a woman , closed the door on her way out . " This is Captain Grafton , sir . " " Admiral Dunedin , Jake . We got your message about the crash . How 's Moravia ? " " In a coma . It 's an open question whether she 'll pull through . She ejected too low and her chute did n't fully open before she hit the ground . She 's got a fractured skull , damaged spleen and a varietyof other problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tarkington ? " " Not a scratch . " " So what happened ? " " Well , sir , the way it looks right now , the fly-by-wire system is suspect . We were having troubles with the control inputs  --  they were too much at low speeds  --  so we went with new E-PROMs . Now , all those parameters are supposed to be trouble-shot and double-checked on the bench test equipment and all that , but something went wrong somewhere . The plane got away from Rita in a high-G maneuver and went into an inverted spin . She recovered , then it departed again when she pulled G on the pullout . Coming out of the second spin , she just ran out of sky . It flipped on the pullout and Toad punched . " Hindsight and all , they should have ejected on the second departure , but . . . They were trying to save the plane . Now it looks like Toad may have punched too late for Rita . " " How 's Tarkington taking it ? " " Blaming himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know , they 're married . " There was a pregnant silence . " I did n't know . " " Yeah . " " Did that have any bearing on this accident ? " " Not that I can see . They stayed with the plane because it was a prototype and they were trying to save it . Rita thought she could save it all the way down . The last departure at five thousand feet above the ground made it a lost cause. , so Toad punched them bothout while they still had a little room left in teh seat performancep305envelope . Apparently they were closer to the edge of the envelope than he thought . " " TRX does n't have another prototype . " " I know . We 're going to have to go with the data we have . I 'll get started on the report as soon as I get back to Washington . But I would appreciate it if you would get a team of experts from the company that made that fly-by-wire system out here , like tomorrow . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers . " " You have the box ? " " One of them , anyway . It 's a little mashed up , but all the circuitryand boards appear intact . I 'm hoping they can test it . " " Why not just put it on a plane to the factory ? " " I want to be there when they check it out . And just now I ca n't leave here . " " I understand . " They talked for several more minutes , then hung up . Both men had a lot to do . Toad wandered the corridors , looking in on Rita from time to time . A nurse was with her every minute . The evening nurse was a woman in her thirties , and she never gave him more than a glance . Rita was in good hands , he told himself . But she did n't move . She just lay there in the ICU cubicle with her eyes closed , her chest slowly rising and falling in time with the mechanical hissing and clicking of the respirator . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines on the cathode-ray tube . What he could see of her face was swollen , mottled . So after looking yet again at Rita and her bandages and all the equipment , he would wander off down the hall , lost in his own thoughts . Hospitals in the evening are dismal places , especially when there are n't many visitors . The staffers rush on unknown errands along the waxed linoleum of the corridors . In the rooms lay the sick people with their maladjusted televisions blaring out the networks ' mixture of violence and comedy and ads for the consumer trash of a too wealthy society . The canned laughter and incomprehensible dialogue float through open doors and down the clean , sterile corridors , sounding exactly like the insane cackling of a band of whacked-out dopers . No one in the captive audience laughs oreven chuckles at the frilvel on the screens . It 's just noise to helpp306survive a miserable experience . Or background noise while you die . Toad hated hospitals . He hated all of it  --  the pathetic potted plants and cut flowers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedpans and urine bottles , the gleaming aluminum IV frames , the distant buzzer of someone trying to summon a nurse , the moans of some poor devil out of his head , the smell of disinfectant , the whispering  --  he loathed it all . He relived the final minutes of the flight yet again . It did n't matter that he was in a hospital corridor with the TV noise and the nurses talking in the background : he was back in the plane with the negative Gs and the spinning and Rita 's voice in his ears . In his private world the events of seconds expanded into minutes , and every sensation and emotion racked him more powerfully than before . He found himself in the staff lounge . He had n't eaten since breakfast , but he was n't hungry . He got a pop from the machine and sipped it while he inspected the bulletin board . Apparently management was having the usual trouble keeping the staff lounge clean . And the bowling league still needed more people . Come on , people ! Sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget all these bastards here in the hospital for a little while . They 'll still be here on Friday . He thought about calling Rita 's parents , and finally decided to do it . He tried for three minutes to persuade the long-distance operatorto bill the call to his number in Virginia , and when she refused , called collect . No one answered . Back down the corridor to check on Rita . No change . Another glance from the nurse . He walked and walked and flew again , spinning wildly , out of control , the altimeter winding down , down , down , out there on the very edge of life itself . " So what are the possibilities ? " Jake addressed the question to George Wilson , the aerodynamics expert . The group had watched the videotape made by the chase plane flown by Smoke Judy . " It 's an inverted spin , no question , " Wilson said . " Why ? " " The plane has negative stability . All these low-observable designsdo . The fly-by-wire system is supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant . If the pilot released the controls , a plane with positive stability would tend to return to a wings-level , stable condition . Neutral stability meant that the airplanewould stay in the flight attitude it was in when the controls were released . Negative stability , on the other hand , meant that once the plane was displaced from wings-level , it would tend to increase the rate of displacement if the controls were released . " So the fly-by-wire system is the first place to look , " Jake Grafton said . " Smoke , you saw this whole thing up close and personal . Do you have anything you want to add ? " " No , sir . I think the movie captured it , got even more of it than I remember seeing at the time . We could sit and niggle over her decision to recover from the second spin instead of ejecting , but I doubt that would be fair . It was a prototype and she 's a test pilot . " Jake nodded . He agreed with Smoke , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm 's length after that night he saw him in West Virginia , yet except for that unexplained sighting , he had nothing else against the man . Judy was proving to be a fine officer and an excellent pilot , a man whose opinions and judgment could be trusted . Which was precisely why Jake had assigned him to fly the chase plane . They discussed the test results they had and decided how to proceed . As Jake had told the admiral , his report was going to be written with the data the group had gathered . The reason for the crash would have to be included , if it could be established by the time he was ready to submit the document . So this evening he assigned the bulk of his staff to compiling test results and the rest to investigate , or monitor the contractor 's investigation of , the crash . " Except for the people who are working with TRX , the rest of you need to get back to Washington and dig in . Admiral Dunedin and SECNAV will want the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ten that night to look in on Rita and talk to the doctor on duty . When he was finished , he dragged Toad off to the VOQ . " If you 're blaming yourself about this , you 'd better stop , " he said when they were in the car. ' l'arkington was glum . " She fought it all the way down . The controls were just too sensitive . The plane was out there on theedge of the envelope-high G , high angle of attchk-and everyp308time she thought she had it under control she lost it again . She kept saying , I 've got it this time . ' " " She 's not a quitter . " " Not by a long shot . " Toad looked out the passenger 's side window . " A hundred and twenty pounds of pure guts . " " So now you 're telling yourself you should have ejected on the second departure . " " Only a thousand times today . " " Why did n't you ? " " I should have . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Naw , " said Toad Tarkington , swallowing hard . " That was n't it . For just a few seconds there I was flying with you again , over the Med , and you were telling me to hang in there , Toad-man , hang tough . So I hung tough . I wanted to give Rita that chance . She was asking for it . So I sat there and watched the altimeter unwind and waited for her to perform her miracle , and look  --  I may have killed her , or crippled her for life . " " It 's all your fault , is that it ? " " Aw , Christ , CAG . " " Well , if you 'd been in the front seat and she 'd been in the back , what would you have done ? " " About what Rita did . If I were as good a pilot as Rita . " " I 've been around these planes for a few years , Toad , and let me tell you , there are no right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every option has unforeseen twists . If you had jumped when the plane departed the second time , with fifteen or sixteen thousand feet of altitude , you and Rita would have spent the rest of your lives thinking you jumped too soon , that you might have saved it if you had hung in there just a little longer . My father always called that being between a rock and a hard place . " Toad shook his head . " Years ago , in Vietnam , I learned that you ca n't second-guess yourself . You have to do the best you can all the time , make the best decision you can in the time you have to make it  --  which is always precious little  --  and live with the consequences regardless . That 's the way flying is . And occasionally you 're going to make a mistake , fuck it up . That 's inevitable . The trick is to not make a fatal mistake . " Jake Grafton 's voice hardened . " Flying is n't chess or football orcheckers ! Flying is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essence  --  it 's the straight , two hundred-proof stuff . And Rita knows ; she 's a U.S. Naval Aviator . She chose this line of work and worked like a slave to earn that ride today . She knows . " " Yes , " Toad admitted . " She knows . " At 3 A.M. Rita 's mother answered her phone in Connecticut . She had obviously just awoke . " This is Toad Tarkington , Mrs. Moravia . " You know , the guy who married your daughter ? " Sorry to bother you this time of night . I tried to call earlier  --  " " We were at a party . Is everything okay ? " She was wide awake now and becoming apprehensive . " Well , not really . That 's sorta why I 'm calling . I thought you should know . " She went to battle stations while Toad tried to collect his thoughts . He interrupted her torrent of words . " What it is  --  Rita and I jumped out of an airplane today , Mrs. Moravia . Rita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear her talking to Mr. Moravia . The pitch in her voice was rising . " Anyway , Rita 's banged up pretty good and I thought you should know . " " How bad is it ? " " She 's in a coma , Mrs. Moravia . She hit the ground before her parachute had time to open . " Silence . Dead silence . Toad continued , " Anyway , I 'm with her and she 's getting the best medical treatment there is and I 'll call and let you know when anything changes . " Mr. Moravia spoke now . Perhaps his wife had handed him the phone . " What 's the prognosis , son ? " " She could die , Mr. Moravia . She 's in bad shape . " " Should we come out there ? " He did n't even know where Toad was calling from . " Not now . When she comes out of the coma , that might be a good idea . But not now . I 'll keep you advised . " " Are you okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nice that he should ask , Toad thought . " We 'll pray for her . " " Yes . Do that . I 'm doing some of that myself . " Harry Franks , the program manager for TRX , stood in the middle of the hangar issuing orders . A small army of workmen were plac/ing wreckage in piles as he directed . They had been working since dawn . He greeted Jake Grafton without enthusiasm . " Give me five more minutes and we 'll go upstairs , " he said , then pointed to a pile for a forklift operator with a piece of what looked like outboard wingtip . Jake and the commanders wandered toward the door , trying to get out of the way . The plane had exploded and burned when it hit , so the pieces that were left were blackened and charred . In an office on the second floor , the engineers from the company that had manufactured the fly-by-wire system , AeroTech , were completing the setup of their equipment . An AeroTech vice presidentsat on one of the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the network of wires that powered and connectedthe test boxes . He did n't look very vice presidential . He and the engineers had flown in early this morning and had had only a few hours ' sleep . He stood up to shake hands with Jake . After the introductions , they got right to it . The only surviving processor from the crashed prototype was carefully removed from its bent , damaged box and its innards exposed . It was physically examined by the assembled experts with all the curiosity of a group of med students examining a man with a new disease . Jake backed off to let the experts have room . He found himself beside Harry Franks . " Tell me again how the fly-by-wire system works . " " The aircraft had negative stability , " Franks said , hooking his thumbs behind his belt and warming to the subject . " Most hightechtactical aircraft today have negative stability . " Jake nodded . Franks continued . " A human can not fly a negatively stable machine . It would be like trying to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So computers actually do the flying . In that way we could build a highly maneuverable aircraft and optimize its lowobservable  --  stealth  --  featureswithout worrying that we were compromisingor negating the ability of the pilot to control it . Now , the way it works is pretty neat . " Jake allowed himself a small smile . All engineers think elegant solutions to technical problems are neat . " There are three computers , " Harry Franks continued . " They each sample the aircraft 's attitude and all the other raw data  --  like air density , temperature , airspeed and so on  --  forty times a second . Then they see what control input the pilot has made . The pilot'sp311control input merely tells the three computers what the pilot wants the plane to do . The computers then figure out what control throws are necessary to comply with the pilot 's order , and they compare their answers . They take a vote . Any two computers can overrule the third . After the vote , the agreed electrical signal is sent to the hydraulic actuators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty times a second . You understand ? " " Yep . I think so . But how does the computer know how much to move the controls ? That 's what the pilot does in a conventional airplane . " " Well , obviously , the computer has to be told . So the data that it uses is placed in a Programmable Read-Only Memory , a PROM . Since it 's electrical , we call it an E-PROM . There are other types , like UV-PROMS and  --  " Jake halted him with his hand . " So what you guys did when Rita complained of control sensitivity was to change the E-PROMs ? " " Yeah . Exactly . They come on chips . The data is just fried into the little beggars . We called AeroTech and they cooked us some more and flew ' em down . That 's all there was to it . " " But the plane crashed . " " Yeah , " said Harry Franks defensively , " but we do n't know yet " Something went very wrong . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The plane went into three inverted spins . Rita was trying to get it out and succeeded twice . " " Maybe she  --  " " Uh-uh . Nope . She knew exactly what she was doing . She recoveredfrom more inverted spins at Test Pilot School than you 've even seen . " The vice president of AeroTech had a cherubic , round face . The face looked like it had spent two days in the tropical sun when he faced Jake an hour later and said , " I do n't know how it happened , but the data is wrong on this chip . " " How 's that ? " He gestured futilely . " I mean we 've run the data three times , and I do n't know how the heck it happened , but the E-PROM data on this chip is just flat wrong . Look here . " He flipped open a thick computer printout . " See this line here ? " He read off the number , which was all it was , a number . " Now look here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger moved to another mummerp312printout , one Jake had just watched running though the printer . Jake looked . It was a different number . " How could this happen ? I thought you people checked these things . " " We do check the data . After the chip is cooked , we check every damn number . I do n't know what  --  I 'm at a loss what to tell you . " " This is only one box , " Harry Franks said . " There were three of them . Maybe this is the only one that was defective . " " We 'll never know , " Jake Grafton said slowly , surveying the faces around him and trying to catalogue their reactions . " The other boxes got smashed and burned . This is the only one left in one piece . " " I do n't know what to say , " the AeroTech executive said . Jake Grafton walked out of the room , looking for a phone . Luis Camacho listened to Admiral Henry 's voice on the telephone and doodled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all with the proper perspective of course . He had the roofline and baseline right , he decided . " Okay , so AeroTech sold you a defective E-PROM chip . Or two or three of them . Sue the bastards . What do you need the FBI for ? " " I had the aircraft 's control data base printed out from our computer . It 's wrong . Now , I do n't know if the AeroTech chip has this data on it or not , but the stuff in the Pentagon computer is wrong . So I got on the phone to that National Security Agency computer doctor who tends our stuff , Kleinberg . Fred Kleinberg . He played with his top secret programs that I 'm not supposed to know jack about , and tells me the last guy who made a change on that data base was Harold Strong . " Camacho extended the lines of the roof , eaves , and base of the house until they met at the perspective convergence point . Of course , Albright 's house had more shrubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never see it looking just like this . " You still there , Luis ? " " Yeah . I 'm still here . " " I want you and your guys to look into it . " " You called NIS ? " NIS was the Naval Investigative Service . " Nope . Since you are apparently the only guy inside the beltwayp313who knows what the fuck is going on , I want you to investigate this . " " Investigate what ? " " This computer screw-up , you spook asshole . A **35;16463;TOOLONG airplane that 's supposed to be black as the ace of spades just made a smoking hole in the ground and the pilot is at death 's door . The data on the computer chips that fly the plane is wrong . The last guy who messed with the data is dead , murdered . Somebody , someplace is bound to have committed a federal crime . Now get off your fat ass and figure out if the Minotaur or some other bastard is screwing with my program ! Goddamn , what have I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President ? Maybe I should put an ad in the Post ? " " I 'll be over in a little while . " The admiral slammed the phone in Camacho 's ear . The agent cradled his instrument and went to the door . " Dreyfus ? Come in here . " At three o'clock Eastern Daylight Time that afternoon Lloyd Dreyfusand two other FBI agents boarded a plane at National Airport for a flight to Detroit , where a man from the local field office would meet them . They planned to drive straight to AeroTech 's headquarters in the suburbs . The agents were airborne somewhere over Pennsylvania when Toad Tarkington arrived at the hospital at the air force 's Tonopah facility . He stopped at the nurses ' station . " How is she ? " The nurse on duty had been there yesterday when they brought Rita in . She was an air force captain . She looked at Toad with sympathy . " No change , Lieutenant . I 'm sorry . " " The doctor around ? " " He 's eating a late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so . " " Can I see her ? " " Sure . " The ICU nurse nodded and Toad pulled a chair over near Rita 's bed . Her chest was still rising and falling rhythmically , the IVs were dripping , the green line on the heart monitor was spiking  --  she lay exactly as he had seen her yesterday and this morning when he looked in . The IV needles were in her left arm , so he picked up her right hand and massaged it gently . In a moment he wrapped her fingersp314around two of his . " Rita , this is Toad . If you can hear me , squeeze my hand a little . " The hand stayed limp . " Try real hard , Rita . " Nothing . " Harder . " He gave up finally and continued to lightly knead her fingers . There was a window there by her bed . When he pulled the curtainsback he could see the distant blue mountains . Clouds were building over the peaks . Life is not fair . Good things happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goodness or badness of those who bear the load was not factored into the equations for that great computer in the sky . Toad stood facing out the window and ruminated upon it . Somehow he had survived this last ejection all in one piece and Rita had n't . It was n't because he was a good person , or because of his pious rectitude or exemplary morals or conspicuous faith . He was physically okay because he had been lucky , sort of . And Rita was smashed up because her luck deserted her . Yet perhaps the ejection had cost him something more valuable than his life . Your luck wo n't last forever , Tarkington . The day will come , Toad-man , the day will come . Regardless of how you live or the promises you keep , on that day to come your luck will desert you . You wo n't recognize the morning , you wo n't recognize the noon , but that will be the day . And on that day you 'll lose her forever . He slumped into the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at the IV racks , respirator , and heart monitor was harder . He twisted , trying to get comfortable . Somehow , someway , the E-PROMs in the fly-by-wire computerswere screwed up . He had heard them talking this afternoon . How could it happen ? How could TRX and AeroTech 's checks and double checks and Quality Assurance programs all go south at preciselythe same time ? Someday hell ! She might die today , or tomorrow . Or the day after . You could lose her any day . He picked up her hand again and massaged it slowly and gently . Finally he placed it carefully back on the covers . He leaned over Rita and kissed the two square inches on her forehead not covered with a bandage . " Hang tough , Rita . Hang tough . "  |p315The  corporate offices and manufacturingfacilities of AeroTech sat in a manicured industrial subdivisionof a Detroit suburb in a low , sprawling , windowless building among a dozen similar buildings carefully arranged amid the lawns and pruned trees . A gardener was laboring in a flower bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agent Lloyd Dreyfus decided that the goddess of the postindustrialrevolution had come , conquered , and already departed this corner of Michigan . Smokestacks now belonged only to the intercity poor and wretched Third World peasants . Not a single one of the antique structures blighted the skyline in any direction . After a display of credentials to the wide-eyed receptionist , the agents were ushered in to see the president of the company , who had trouble understanding just why the FBI were here at the AeroTechfacilities . No , Dreyfus did not have a search warrant . He had not thought one necessary since AeroTech was a defense contractor with annual billings in the millions and the agents were here to investigate , not to search . But he could , of course , get such a warrantif the official thought it necessary . Did he ? No . Company employeesexamined security clearance documents with care and led the government men to an empty conference room . The investigation took time . At 9 p.m. the FBI team had estab/lished that the data contained on the E-PROM chip from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the data that AeroTech had used to manufacture its chips . Yes , a call had been received last week from a TRX engineer in Tonopah , and yes , he had updated the data base via computer modem . The companyhad manufactured new E-PROM chips based on the revised data . The new chips had been taken to the mail room for overnight shipment . Yes , the records in the mailroom showed three chips sent by a bonded commercial overnight courier . So at 9 P.M. Dreyfus sat in the conference room and scratched his head . He had been making notes all evening on a yellow pad , and now he went over them again , placing a tick mark by each item after he considered it carefully . One of the agents had gone out for burgers , and now Dreyfus munched a cold cheeseburger and sipped a Coke in which all the ice had melted . He decided he had two problems , and he decided to tackle the one that he thought would be the simpler first . He asked to see the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motioned into a chair beside Dreyfus . " Sorry we 're taking so long , " ; Dreyfus said as he wadded up the cheeseburger wrapper and tossed it at a waste can . " Quite all right , " the president said cheerfully enough . His name was Homer T. Wiggins . The company prospectus , which Dreyfus had thumbed through earlier in the evening at a slow moment , said he was the largest shareholder of AeroTech and one of its four founders . " It appears we have a little problem that necessitates a search . Now , when we got here this afternoon I told you we were here to investigate , not search . Now we want to search . We can do so with your permission , or we can go get a warrant . It 's your choice . " Dreyfus got out his pipe and tobacco and began the charging ritual . " Why do you want to search ? " Wiggins asked . Dreyfus shrugged . " I ca n't tell you . I should tell you , though , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find probable cause and issue a search warrant . " " On what grounds ? Just what is it you 're investigating ? " Dreyfus took his time lighting his pipe . He puffed experimentallyto ensure it was lit and drawing properly . Finally satisfied , he tucked his lighter into a pocket and took a deep drag on the pipe . " I ca n't tell you . "  |p317Homer  T. Wiggins had the look of a very sick man . " Just what is it you want to search for ? " " Oh ! Did n't I tell you ? E-PROM chips . " Bewilderment replaced the pain on Wiggins ' face . " Go right ahead . Search to your heart 's content . " After escorting the president out of the conference room and posting an agent to guard the paper spread out on the table , Dreyfusled the other two down the hall and around the corner to the mail room . " Okay , he said . I want computer chips . Start looking . " It took an hour . One agent found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was an hour before Dreyfus decided those were the only chips in the room . Back he went to see the president with the chips in hand . The president 's eyes expanded dramatically . " Okay . Now I want one of your engineers to put these on your testing machine and let me know what these chips are . " With a glance at the clock , Wiggins picked up his phone . A half hour later a rumpled , unhappy engineer with long hair and the faint odor of bourbon about him appeared in the door . " Sorry , Tom , but these men want some tests run this evening . Apparently it ca n't wait until tomorrow . " He held out the bag with the chips in it . " Go with him , Frank , and explain what we want , " Dreyfus told one of the agents , then resumed his exploration of an industry magazine that resided on a side table . The agent appeared in the door at five minutes before midnight and motioned to Dreyfus , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those were the chips that they manufactured last week with the new data from TRX . The engineer is printing out the data now , but it 's exactly the same . " " Good . The guy in the mail room just sent the wrong chips to Tonopah . " " But when the chips reached Tonopah , would n't TRX test them before installation ? " " No doubt they should have , but I suspect someone will admit that there was a mistake , human error , and somehow or other the chips that did get installed did n't get checked . " After all , Dreyfus knew , mistakes made the world the happy place it is today . What should have happened and what did happen were usually vastly different things.  | " Then where the hell did the bad chips come from ? " " From here . Right here . " The question was , how did AeroTech get the erroneous data that was burned into the bad chips ? That data was the stuff Admiral Henry said was in the Pentagon computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to revise . A phone call from Camacho earlier in the afternoon had given Dreyfusthat fact . And the bad data had been cooked onto chips at AeroTech . " Well , Frank , it looks like it 's going to be a long night . I want you to go back to the local office and wake up someone in the U.S. Attorney 's office . Have him get cracking . I want a **25;16500;TOOLONG for all AeroTech 's travel , long-distance-telephone and expense-account records and all the data-base files . Until we have the warrant , we 'll lock this place up and post a guard . Someone around here has a nasty little secret . If we can find the smoking gun , we 'll know who and when and can save ourselves the trouble of listening to a lot of lies . " " You 'll need to come down to the office and write the affidavit . " " Yeah . " He was going to have to call Camacho at home . No doubt Luis Camacho could think of a plausible story for the judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Camacho from a sound sleep . He listened to Dreyfus ' recitation of the events of the eveningas he tried to move noiselessly around the bedroom and put on his robe and slippers . When Dreyfus had completed his summary , Camacho told him to call back in five minutes . He was down in the kitchen sipping a glass of milk when the phone rang again . " Dreyfus again , boss . What do I put on the affidavit ? " " The truth . Suspected illegal sale of classified defense information . Do n't name any names . " " I do n't have any names to name yet . " " Do n't give me that , you pilgrim ! " " Oh , you do n't want me to use Smoke Judy 's name ? Oh ! Okay , John Doe strikes again . Anything else ? " " Bye . " " Night , Luis . " The lights were off over at Albright 's house . Camacho checked from the backyard as he walked out to the swing . It was a hot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swing long . The gnats and mosquitoes were still hunting for rich , red blood . Cursing ,  |p319Camacho  swatted furiously until he regained the safety of his kitchen and got the sliding glass door closed behind him . Wide awake now , he flipped on the radio and twiddled the dial . They were still playing a ball game out on the Coast . Baltimore versus Oakland . Eleventh inning , three runs apiece . Jose Canseco was coming to the plate . The A 's announcer was all atwitter . Camacho searched through the cupboard for something to eat . Did n't she have some crackers in here ? Cookies ? Or did the teenage food monster eat every crumb ? He heard a rapping and turned . The sliding glass door was opening . " Hi , Harlan . Come on in . " " Saw your light . Could n't sleep . The air conditioning crapped out today and that place is too stuffy to sleep in . " " It 'd be better if there was a breeze . " " What a climate ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Want some milk ? " " Yeah . That 'd be good . Got any cookies ? " " I 'm looking . " Up here , behind the flour . Half a package of Fig Newtons . He carried them over to the counter where Albright sat and took one from the package and bit into it . " Little stale , but edible . " The radio audience sighed . Foul tip up toward the press box . Strike two . Harlan Albright helped himself to a cookie while Camacho poured him a glass of milk . Another foul tip . The sound of the bat on the ball was plainly audible . Both men nibbled a cookie and sipped milk as they listened . The announcer was hyping the moment for all it was worth . Menon first and second , one out . Two strikes on Jose Canseco . Another foul tip . " Guy ought to quit fouling the ball , " Albright said . " Sometimes you want them to either hit it or strike out , it does n't matter , as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Camacho mumbled with his mouth full . He swallowed . " But the guy keeps swinging to stay alive . " The Baltimore pitcher swung around and threw to second . Too late . " Now the pitcher 's doing it . " Albright helped himself to another Fig Newton.  |p320Camacho  finished his milk and set the glass in the sink . " Here 's the pitch , " the radio blared . The crack of the bat started the crowd roaring . " Through the hole , looks like it 's going to the wall . Man rounding third is trotting home . And that 's it , folks . The A 's win it in the eleventh inning on an RBI double by Jose Canseco . " Camacho flipped the radio off . " A good player , " Albright told him . " Good kid , " Luis agreed . " Gon na be a superstar . " " If he lasts . " " Yeah . They all got ta last . Everyone has high expectations , then for some reason , sometimes the kid sorta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put Albright 's glass in the sink . " We had high hopes for you  --  " " Why do n't you go home and swelter at your house , Harlan . It 's two-thirty in the morning and I have to work tomorrow . " " I do n't . Got the air conditioner guys coming in the morning . I 'll call in sick . Tomorrow night my place is going to be like Moscow in winter . " " Terrific . " Albright heaved himself off the stool and reached for the sliding glass door . As his hand closed on it , he paused and looked at Camacho . " Anything new ? " " Yeah . One or two little things , since you mentioned it . The Soviet ambassador got a letter several weeks ago . For some reason there was a stain on it , a jelly stain . We analyzed it . Looks like a French brand of blueberry . Imported . We have a dozen agents on it . " Amazing . " Albright shook his head like a great bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eh ? " " It might . You never know . " " Amazing . All those letters , over three and a half years ! The Minotaur has never made a mistake , not even one tiny slip . And now he sends a letter with a jelly stain on it ? It 's too good to be real . " " You take your breaks where you find them . If it is a break . We 'll find out if I can keep enough people working on it . Another development just cropped up . " " Like what ? Peanut butter on the envelope ? " " Nothing to do with the Minotaur . "  | " What ? " Albright was no longer amused . " Crash of the navy 's ATA prototype . Augered in yesterday out in Nevada . " He glanced at the wall clock . " Day before yesterday , actually . Seems somebody has been peddling erroneous information to a defense contractor . AeroTech . So the smelly stuff has hit the fan , so to speak . " " Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat . " What am I supposed to do now ? Salute ? " Albright slid the door open . " I 'm not kidding , Luis . We need some progress . " He stepped through the door and pulled it shut behind him . Then he disappeared into the darkness . A minute or so later , Luis Camacho locked the door and pulled the drapes . After Jake Grafton and the rest of the staff left for Washington , the atmosphere at the base at Tonopah took on the ethereal silence of a graveyard , or so it seemed to Toad Tarkington . He divided his time between the hangar , where a TRX crew was mocking up the remnants of the airplane he and Rita had abandoned , and the hospital , where Rita remained in a coma . Toad drove the two miles back and forth between the two locationsin an air force sedan that one of the commanders had assumed he would return to the motor pool . He would , eventually , but he was in no hurry . After all , the commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to return it . The lounge in the VOQ was empty . The other guests apparently were too busy to hang around the pool table and bet dimes and swap lies while the TV hummed in the background , as the naval aviators had . The camaraderie was an essential part of naval aviation . Those who flew the planes gave and demanded this friendshipof each other . That first evening alone Toad tossed the cue ball down the table and watched it carom off the rails . He looked at the empty seats and the blank TV screen and the racks of cue sticks , and trudged off to his room to call Rita 's parents yet again . He was talking to them twice a day now . He was also calling his own folks out in Santa Barbara once a day , keeping them updated on Rita and talking just to hear their voices . Likely as not his parents were slightly baffled and secretlypleased by this attention from the son who usually phoned once ap322month and never wrote because he had said everything in the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , now , with Rita in such bad shape , the sound of his mother 's voice was so comforting . After the second day alone , it finally occurred to him that the problem was that he had almost nothing to do . He was standing in the hangar watching , listening , but he had no people to superviseor reports to write or memos due , so he merely observed with his mind in neutral . At the hospital he sat beside Rita , who was moved to a private room , and did a monologue for her or stared at the wall . And thought . He pondered and thought and mused some more . That evening on the way to the hospital he stopped by the exchangeand bought a spiral notebook . In Rita 's room he began to write . " Dear Rita , " he began , then sucked on the pen and looked out the window . He dated the page . Dear , dear Rita : " Someday you will wake , and when you do , I will give you this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a sitting . He started out writing about Toad Tarkington : growing up in southern Californiawith the beach and surf just down the road , baseball and football in the endless summer , the hard-bodied bimbettes chased and wooed and sometimes conquered . He described how he felt about his first true love , and his second and third and fourth . He devoted page after page to college and grades and all-night parties . Finally he decided he had squeezed the sponge pretty dry on his youth , so he turned to the navy . Without his even realizing it , his style changed . Instead of the light , witty , listen-to-this style he had adopted for tales of his youth , he wrote seriously now , with no attempt at humor . Facts , impressions , opinions , ambitions , they came pouring from his pen . In four days the TRX crew finished their work and mysteriously vanished . Several days later a group of officers and civilians from Washington arrived unannounced . They poked and prodded the dismembered , blackened carcass and photographed everything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baking ramp in front of base ops . Toad was left with his solitude and his writing . So the days passed , one by one , as Rita slept . In Washington , Jake Grafton was also writing , though he wentabout it in a vastly different manner than Tarkington . He dictatedp323general ideas into a recording machine and gave the tapes to his subordinates , who expanded the ideas into smooth , detailed drafts which Jake then worked on with a pencil . Flight test data and observationswere marshaled , correlated and compiled . Graphs were drawn and projections made about performance , maintenance manhours , mean time between failures and , of course , costs . Money dripped from every page . Every officer in the group had an input , and conclusions and recommendations were argued and reargued around Jake 's desk , with him listening and jotting notes and occasionallyindicating he had heard enough on one subject or another . All of it went into a mushrooming document with the words " top secret " smeared all over . Vice Admiral Tyler Henry spent some unhappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the data contained on the E-PROM chip from the crashed prototype was identical to the erroneous data contained in the Pentagon computer file that had last been changed by the deceased Captain Harold Strong . TRX 's latest , correct batch of E-PROM data was also in the computer , but under another file number . Three days and a dozen phone calls after he had sent Lloyd Dreyfus to Detroit , Camacho went himself . On Thursday at noon he rode the Metro out to National Airport and was sitting in the president of AeroTech 's office in Detroit at 3:50 . Homer T. Wiggins had gotten himself a lawyer , a manicured , fiftyish aristocrat in a Brooks Brothers suit and dark maroon tie . His stylish tan and his gray temples and sideburns made him look like something sent over from central casting . " Martin Prescott Nash , " he pronounced with a tiny nod at Camacho , then pointedly ignored the proffered hand . Camacho retracted his spurned appendage and used a handkerchief to wipe it carefully as he sized up Wiggins , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outraged rectitude . " My client is one of the most respected leading citizens of this state , " Nash began in a tone that might come naturally to a feministactivist lecturing a group of convicted rapists . He had it just right  --  the slight voice quaver , the distinct pronunciation of each word , the subtle trace of outrage . " He is active in over a dozen civic organizations , gives over half a million dollars a year to charity and provides employment to six hundred people , every one ofp324had just the slightest little bit of difficulty pronouncing the word " gentlemen . " Nash continued , listing the contributions Homer T. Wiggins had made to the arts , the people of the great state of Michigan and the human race . Camacho settled into his chair and let him go , occasionallyglancing at his watch . Dreyfus waited until he had Camacho 's eye , then winked broadly . Wiggins saw the gesture and winced . Finally , as Nash paused for breath , Camacho asked , " Are you a criminal lawyer ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I-specialize in corporate law . My firm has advised Homer for ten years now . We handled his last stock offering , over ten million shares on the American Exchange , and the subordinated debenture  --  " " He needs a criminal lawyer . " Deflated , Nash looked to his left , right at the pasty , perspiring face of leading citizen Homer T. Wiggins , who was staring at Camacho and licking his lips . " Read him his rights , Dreyfus . " Both agents knew this had been done on one prior occasion , yesterday , and Wiggins had declined to answer questions unless his lawyer was present . Dreyfus removed the Miranda card from his credentials folder and read it yet again , slowly , with feeling . The warning usually had a profound effect on men who had never in their lives thought of themselves as criminals . All the color drained from Wiggins ' face and he began to breathe in short , rapid breaths . It was as if he could hear the pillars crumbling and see the plaster falling from the ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had housed him so well all these years . As Dreyfus put the card away , Wiggins squeaked , " You going to arrest me ? " " That depends . " " On what ? " said Martin Prescott Nash , who was looking a little pale himself . " On whether or not I get some truthful answers to the questions I came here to ask . " " Are you offering immunity ? " " No . I have no such authority . I am here to question Mr. Wigginsas a principal about bribery of a government employee andillegally obtaining classified defense information . Both charges arep325felonies . If you want to talk to us , Mr. Wiggins , we 'll listen . We may or may not arrest you today . I have n't decided . Anything you say will be included in our reports and will be conveyed to the Justice Department . The attorneys there may or may not use it as evidence against you . They may take it into account when they are trying to decide if prosecution is warranted , or they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a sentencing recommendationafter your conviction  --  if there is one  --  or again , they may not . I have nothing to offer . You have the right to remain silent , but you 've heard your rights and your attorney is here with you . Or you can decide to cooperate with the government that you and your six hundred employees support with your tax dollars by telling us the truth . It 's up to you . " Nash wanted to talk to his client in private . The agents went out into the hall and walked down toward the cafeteria . " Have you really got it ? " Camacho asked Dreyfus . " Chapter and verse . He turned in expense-account reports for every trip to Washington , including credit-card receipts for dinners with the name Thomas H. Judy on the back as a business guest in his own handwriting . Apparently he did n't want any more trouble with those IRS troglodytes about his expense account . " " Can you tie him personally to the data ? " " Yep . An engineer here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself handed it to him . Told him to make up some experimental chips to see if they could validate the method and their computer stuff , and to develop a cost projection . All of which he did . Other people swear to that . I 've got a sworn statement in writing from this engineer burning Wiggins and a cassetterecording of him telling it to me originally . And the NSA computer records show Judy as one of the officers who had routine access to the E-PROM data . We 've got Homer T. cold as a frozen steak . " " Is this the right time ? " Camacho muttered , thinking aloud . " Well , shit ! " Dreyfus hissed . " 1 do n't know ! I just dig this stuff up . You  --  " Camacho silenced him with a glance . Dreyfus lit his pipe and walked along with smoke billowing . " So why the big screw-up with the chips ? " Camacho asked when they reached the cafeteria , which housed three microwaves and a wall full of vending machines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data dumps from  |p326TRX  and even one from the Pentagon , all in the last three months . The first three chips just sat there on the engineer 's desk . No one is sure how or when they went to the mail room . No one knows how they got mixed up with an outgoing shipment . The mail-room guy is from Haiti , with a heavy accent . He denies everything . Rumor has it he used to be a medical doctor in his former life . " Dreyfus shrugged . " Looks like human error , that plus the usual carelessness and a tiny pinch of rotten luck . Voila ! Anything that can go wrong , will . Is n't that the fourth or fifth law of thermodynamics or Murphy or the Georgia state legis-lature ? " " Something like that . " Carnacho removed a plastic cup full of decaffeinated coffee from the vending machine and sat on a plastic chair at a plastic table beneath a fluorescent light with a faulty igniter  --  the light hummed and flickered . " I think the doctor in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see his green card ? " " Nope . " " Going to ? " " Not unless you tell me to . " " Let 's go see if Wiggins wants to talk . " Dreyfus stoked his pipe again on the stroll down the hall . Wiggins ' secretary glared at them . Dreyfus gave her a sympathetic grin , which she ignored . They sat silently and flipped through the magazines on the stand . It was five more minutes before the buzzer sounded and they were waved into the inner sanctum . " My client , " said the counselor , " wishes to cooperate . With the understanding , of course , that he can cease answering questions at any time . " Wiggins had met Smoke Judy on five different occasions . Judy knew that AeroTech needed contracts and offered to help in return for a small cash payment and some stock . On two occasions he talked about a job after he retired . Wiggins had been noncommittal about the job , but had agreed to the money and the stock . Five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares of AeroTech  --  currently worth $12.75 each  --  had bought the companyan advance peek at the flight control data for the TRX prototype . The navy was just floating a Request for Proposal ( RFP ) for the fly-by-wire system . AeroTech bid for the chip business andwon the contract.  |p327All  this Wiggins admitted , but he stoutly denied any wrongdoing . " This company , it needs the business . And we underbid every other contractor for those chips . We saved the government a lot of money . We did n't do anything that other defense contractors do n't routinely do . It 's a cutthroat business . " The FBI agents seemed unimpressed . " Listen , if I had n't agreed to Judy 's offer , he would have peddledthat information to my competitors . Then where would I have been ? No contract . I have a duty to this company . " Color returned to Homer Wiggins ' cheeks . " Of course , " Dreyfus said , " you could have called us when Judy first approached you . " " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my bare hands , with no money , with a ton of sweat , taking risks that would scare the wits out of a Vegas gambler . I built it ! " Camacho found himself staring at Wiggins ' gold wedding ring and gold class ring . Was that Yale ? " Now the navy wants me to make E-PROMs cheaper than anyone else . So I do . And this is the gratitude , this is the reward ! I am treated like a criminal ! " He sprayed saliva across the desk , and for the first time Camacho saw the drive and determination that had built a successful corporation . " I am treated like a criminal for doing what everyone else does and for making E-PROM chips cheaper than anyone else can . " Camacho looked at his watch : 5:30 . Maybe he was still in the office . " Do you want to go to jail tonight ? " Wiggins gaped . The blood drained from his face , and for a momentCamacho thought he had stopped breathing . " No , " he whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Camacho cut him off with a jab of his hand . " Have you talked to Judy this week ? " " No . No ! " " I want you to call him for me . I 'll tell you what to say . I 'll listen on an extension . You will say precisely what I tell you and nothing else . Will you do it ? " " What choice do I have ? " Wiggins was recovering . This man 's recuperative powers were excellent . He could handle it . " You do n't go to jail this evening . I make my report to the JusticeDepartment and they take it from there . If they indict you , that 's their business . My report wills how that you cooperated. "  | " I 'll make the call . " " Homer , " said Nash , " maybe  --  " " I 'll make the call . And you go on home , Prescott . Thanks for being here this afternoon . I 'll call you . " " Are you sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was examining his hands . Martin Prescott Nash rose from his chair and went out the door . It swung shut behind him . " Smoke , this is Homer Wiggins . " " I told you never to call me  --  " " Something 's come up . The FBI are here , in Detroit . They 're checking out the chips . I 'm just letting you know . " Smoke Judy was silent for several seconds . " Have they talked to you ? " " Yes . " " What  --  ? " His voice fell . " Do they know ? " " About you ? I do n't know . I think  --  they might . Definitely . " " Did you  --  ? " " I 've got to go now , Smoke . I just wanted you to know . " Wig- gins held the instrument away from his ear , and at a nod from Camacho , Dreyfus simultaneously depressed the buttons on bothtelephones , severing the connection . When they were alone in the car on the way back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job for you tomorrow , Dreyfus . We 're going to need all our people , and you 'll probably have to borrow a bunch . " Dreyfus fished out his pipe and tobacco and merely glanced at his boss . " I want to keep track of a man . We 'll need discreet surveillance teams , couple of choppers and the electronics boys . " " Anyone I know . " " Nope . It 's my next-door neighbor , guy named Harlan Al-bright . " " You know , in my fifteen years in the FBI I have never felt more like a mushroom than I have working for you . You 've kept me in the dark and shoveled shit at me for eighteen months now . If you got croaked tomorrow , I could n't even tell the old man what the hell you were working on . I do n't know . " Camacho , behind the wheel , kept his eyes on the road . " Thep329three days ago when his air conditioning went out . It was too goodan opportunity to pass up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his window . The car 's air conditioning was going full blast . " Think he 's screw- " Read the security regulations lately , Dreyfus ? " " Listen , boss . And listen good . You want good solid work from me but you do n't want me to know anything . Now I am just aboutone day away from submitting my resignation . I do n't need thisshit and I 'm not gon na keep taking it ! Not for you , not for the oldman , not for the Director , not for any of you spook dingdongs . Andyou can put that in my final evaluation ! " Camacho braked the car to a stop at a light . He just sat therebehind the wheel , watching the light , waiting for it to change . When it did , he glanced left and hesitated . An old junker car was going to run the red . As it hurled by , Dreyfus leaned out his window with his middle finger jabbed prominently aloft . Camacho took his foot off the brake and fed gas . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know what 's going on . I 'll tell you . " And he did.  |p330On  Saturday the sun rose into a clean , bright sky , a pleasant change from the haze that had been stalled over the Potomac River basin for a week . The morning weatherman credited a cold front that had swept through during the night and blessed the metropolitan Washington area with some much-needed showers . Commander Smoke Judy absorbed the weather information while he scraped at his chin . He had acquired the habit of listening to the morning forecasts during his twenty years in naval aviation , and it was hard to break . Yet he was n't paying much attention . His mind was on other things . After finishing at the sink and dressing , he poured himself a glass of orange juice and opened the sliding glass door to his apartmentbalcony . The view was excellent , considering he was only six floors up . From out here he could see the gleam of the Potomac and , on the horizon , the jutting spire of the Washington Monument . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Airport . Even with that cold front last night today would be hot . Already the sun had a bite to it . He sat on the little folding chair in the sun and thought once again about Harold Strong and the flight control data and Homer T. Wiggins of AcroTech . Nothing in life ever works out just thep331way you think it will , he told himself bitterly . They should put that over the door of every public building in Washington . Strong had gotten suspicious . Judy had spent one too many eveningsin the office , asked one too many questions about that TRX flyby-wiresystem . So Strong had doctored the data , rendering it worthlessunless one knew exactly how and where it had been changed . When Smoke found out , it was too late . He had already given the data to AeroTech , to Homer T. Wiggins . Oh , even defective it was good for what Homer wanted it for , to check the AeroTech manufacturing capability and cost out the manufacturing process . Heck , he could have written Homer a purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thing . So it was n't like he had stiffed Homer . And both he and Homer knew that the preliminary data would be changed , probably many times , during the course of development . There was no possibility that the erroneous stuff would end up in an airplane that someone was going to try to fly . And still , it happened ! It happened . All the checks that were supposed to be done , the fail-safe , zero-defects program , all of it went down the trapper in an unbelievable series of coincidences . Now TRX was going to fire a couple of clowns who each thought the other guy had done the checks . So neither did them . He tossed off the last gulp of orange juice and wiped his mouth with his fingers . He sat the empty glass on the concrete beside his chair and sat looking at the city . Nothing he had ever attempted in his whole life had worked out right . What was it the hippies called it ? Karma ? Funny , killing Harold Strong had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy . No doubt someway , somehow , he had fucked that up too . Looking back , it had been a bad decision . Strong probably had nothing but a few baseless suspicions that he could n't prove . Ah well , what was done was done . You signed for the plane and flew it as best you could and if today was your day to die , you died . That was life . He had wanted something besides a pension , and now he had his savings  --  about $56,000  --  and the cash from five little deals  --  $30,000  - -  - and some stock he probably could n't sell . Plus his pension , a lousy 55 percent of his base pay if he lasted twenty-two years . Yet if he cut and ran , his pension would evaporate like a gob of
