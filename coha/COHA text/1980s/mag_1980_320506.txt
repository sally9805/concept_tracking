Reagan 's campaign suffers from disorganized staff work <P> So far , victory has been especially sweet for Ronald Reagan because he has not had to share the credit with anyone . Ever since he fired Campaign Manager John Sears last February , Reagan has been his own boss , and who can argue with success ? He breezed through most of the primaries , brushing aside his opponents without really seeming to be trying . But as a Republican strategist who backs Reagan says , " It was historical momentum rather than operational depth or skill that won it . " When the going gets rough in the months ahead , Reagan will need solid work from a staff that has shown some alarming signs of disorganization . <P> One key example was the needless confusion over whether or not Reagan should retain Bill Brock as chairman of the Republican National Committee . First he wanted to keep him on ; then some aides said Brock had to go ; finally Reagan kept him after all . The campaign in the states is off to an ominously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last week aides somehow failed to pass along an invitation to Reagan to address the N.A.A.C.P. convention in Miami . Reagan does not often appear before black groups and may not have wanted to go to Miami anyway . But he unnecessarily offended the organization by sending his regrets at the last minute and then taking off on a long-planned vacation in Mexico . When N.A.A.C.P. Chief Benjamin Hooks publicly complained about the slight , Reagan apologized and assured Hooks he had not written off the black vote . He quickly accepted an invitation to address the National Urban League when it meets in New York on Aug. 5 . <P> Reagan 's problem is not so much the quality of his top aides , who are mainly competent professionals . But some are new to their jobs and , more important , do not get clear directions from the nominee-to-be . When the Sears team was ousted , it was replaced by a triumvirate . Cam- paign Manager William Casey is an able administrator , but , despite his title , he is more a chairman of the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan very long . <P> Chief of Staff Ed Meese is an old Reagan loyalist with an easygoing , reassuring presence and skills as a coordinator . <P> Pollster and Strategist Richard Wirthlin smiles all the time and has reason to : his estimates are usually right on target . <P> To strengthen the staff , Reagan last week named William Timmons as his political director . Though Timmons has worked for Reagan 's G.O.P. rivals in past presidential races , he was selected because of his close ties to the party 's moderate wing and because he had served effec - tively as a White House liaison with Congress . Timmons has been running a successful lobbying operation in Washington that , along with work for other major cli ents , helped Chrysler get its loan guarantee . In command of the campaign 's 20 regional directors and 50 state chairmen , Timmons will be responsible for allocating money to the states and coordinating grass-roots activities .
