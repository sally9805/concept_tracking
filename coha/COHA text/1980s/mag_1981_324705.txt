Like so many of the approximately 25,000 spectators who turned out for the Braemar Highland Games in Scotland , Prince Charles , 32 , and Diana , Princess of Wales , 20 , donned their tartans . During the opening ceremonies , however , Diana 's highland fling turned a bit flippant : as the band struck up God Save the Queen , the young Princess continued chatting with the Prince . Hardly the proper reaction , especially when the subject of the song is standing a few feet away . Without saying a word , Queen Elizabeth turned to her daughter-in-law with that now famous " We are not amused " look that would curl the hair on a corgi 's back . God Save the Queen-to-Be . <P> " If I was being honored in Dallas , they would have dropped me from a helicopter without a parachute , " said Actor Larry ( " J.R . " ) Hagman , 49 , who last week became part of the pavement along the Hollywood Walk of Fame . The three-mile-long celebrity stretch has honored just about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For Hagman , place was everything-his star was imbedded next to that of his mother , Broadway Great Mary Martin , 67 . When Mom congratulated him , Larry noted the positioning of their two stars , then said : " Looks like I 'm going to get top billing . " Countered Mary : " It all depends on which way you walk down the street . " <P> Oh , to be in New York in the fall , when they 're lining up for sausages back in Gdansk . But to Zygmunt Przetakiewicz , 35 , a representative of Solidarity , Poland 's independent union federation , his Manhattan stayover is strictly business . Przetakiewicz has since been busying himself with preparations for the opening of Solidarity 's first overseas press information office on Park Avenue South and adjusting to New York City . <P> " This job is going to be very difficult , " says Zygmunt , who now drives his 1979 Oldsmobile to work every day . " The subways are terrible , and the roads-I think they are better in Poland . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambled onto the green . Crouched in his Ben Crenshaw-like putting stance , Nathaniel Crosby , 19 , shot a final glance at the pin , coolly sank the 15-ft. birdie putt , then jubilantly leaped into the arms of his caddie , Joby Ross . Bing Crosby 's son had just won the 81st U.S. Amateur Golf Championship . Off course , the University of Miami junior displayed all the easygoing awshucksness of his late father , but during play he proved to be a scrappy , tenacious opponent . Coming back from four holes down during the final afternoon round , Nathaniel scrambled over San Francisco 's Olympic Club course , peppering his play with instructions to the ball : " Get tight , " " Be there , " " Go , " " Sit , " " Stop . " Throughout the match , he soothed his nerves with something given to him earlier by his mother , Kathryn Crosby , a medallion that Bing had won for making the field in the same tournament exactly 40 years earlier . " I definitely felt his presence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Crosby . " I was n't absentmindedly touching that medal . Dad was in my mind all day . " - By E. Graydon Carter <P> On the Record
