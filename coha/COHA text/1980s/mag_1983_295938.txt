The White House looks for a successor , Congress looks for dirt <P> When the Administration needed a caretaker for the battered Environmental Protection Agency as it searched for a permanent replacement for departing Administrator Anne Burford , John Hernandez seemed a perfect choice . A water-pollution expert and former dean of engineering at New Mexico State University , Hernandez had distinguished himself as one of the few top EPA officials not caught in the crossfire of charges about sweetheart deals , political manipulation , conflict of interest and mismanagement . Some of his colleagues caustically pointed out that he could credit his clean slate at least in part to his exclusion from the agency 's decision-making echelon . " He was lucky to get invited to meetings , " said a former EPA official . <P> But even such a seemingly safe choice for acting administrator has turned into an exploding cigar for the White House . By week 's end three House subcommittees and the EPA 's inspector general were probing a spate of charges that Hernandez made improper decisions benefiting industry . Reagan aides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing space and subdue the impression that the Administration has favored polluters , were foiled . Groused one White House official : " Every time we turn around , something is screwed up over there . " <P> At first , things seemed to be going well . Although his chances were slim , Hernandez began actively campaigning to keep his job , signaling the White House that he could improve the agency 's tarnished image . In a sharp contrast to the deep personnel and money cuts supported by Burford , he prepared supplemental budgets seeking more congressional funds . He also dismissed EPA Official Louis Cordia , who two years ago compiled a " hit list " of ideologically suspect agency employees . <P> At midweek the " fresh start " fizzled . Democratic Congressman James Scheuer , who heads one of the six congressional panels investigating the agency , charged that Hernandez personally intervened to allow Dow Chemical Co. to edit a July 1981 agency report about dioxin contamination of two rivers and a bay near its Midland , Mich. , plant . EPA officials agreed to Dow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fertility problems and birth defects , as well as the conclusion that " Dow 's discharge represented the major source , if not the only source , of dioxin contamination " in the waterways . <P> Testifying before the House Public Works Oversight Subcommittee , Hernandez acknowledged that he urged Valdas Adamkus , head of the EPA 's Midwest regional office , to hear Dow out on the report but denied ordering him to let company officials make changes . In a stunning public break with his bosses , however , Adamkus testified on Friday that his staffers had been " forced " by Washington headquarters to strike out the passages . Hernandez was angry that the Midwest office had prepared the report in the first place , Adamkus said , and was " denouncing our report and calling the work of our regional people ' trash . ' " Dow was saying little , in part because there is a Justice Department suit pending over the company 's refusal to yield technical data about its toxic emissions to the EPA .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
