In his first 100 days , Duarte finds setbacks , success and promise <P> From the Casa Presidential in San Salvador , Jos Napolen Duarte last week issued a decree creating a commission to investigate political killings committed by El Salvador 's right-wing death squads . In a country where 50,000 people , 1 out of every 100 citizens , have died in political violence of one sort or another in the past five years , the news should have been greeted with sweeping enthusiasm . Instead , it was hardly greeted at all . The announcement was mentioned only briefly in the capital 's three major newspapers and received no coverage on the country 's three commercial television stations , all of which are owned by wealthy businessmen who oppose Duarte as being dangerously leftist . <P> The episode neatly illustrated both the power and the problems of the new President .

" <P> Duarte is especially proud of his success in curbing the death squads . In the three months since inauguration day , there have been about 450 killings , down from 630 during the previous three months . According to Roman Catholic Archbishop Arturo Rivera y Damas , fewer people " disappear " while in the custody of police and army officers , and relatives are being permitted to visit prisoners with increasing frequency .                   @ @
