 | After drinking 20 glasses of beer down at the pool hall , Jonathan Laastad set off on a crime spree through his native Hickory , N.C. It was late and the pickings were slim : he swiped six bucks ' worth of cigarettes from a local diner , took a framed dollar bill off the wall of an Exxon station and proceeded to the village school , where police caught him in the kitchen , chewing through a fair-sized ham . A repeat offender , Laastad seemed bound for a long stay at the state pen . Instead , a judge sent him to a program called Community Penalties , which is now operating in five North Carolina cities . The upshot : Laasted had to pay $210 to his victims , attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings , clear field brush at the local airport for 150 hours and spend 12 weekends in jail . Another deplorable example of bleeding-heart justice ? No , says Stevens Clarke , a University of North Carolina law and government professor . This was , rather , a case of the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that even a society with an urge to incarcerate ? a record 577,357 criminals now crowd the nation 's jails ? must realize that there are definite limits . Federal judges have ordered more than half the states to reduce prison overcrowding . And there simply is n't enough money left in state coffers to build and staff new prisons . Says Clarke : " If you can deter and control offenders less expensively by keeping them in the community , then everybody gains . " Magic band : Across the nation , states are urgently looking for ways to punish nonviolent crooks , short of putting them behind bars . Dozens of counties are trying " intensive probation , " complete with frequent visits from probation officers , nightly curfews and unscheduled drug testing . Communities from Palm Beach , Fla. , to Bordentown , N.J. , have opted for a hightech form of house arrest : the offender stays home wearing an electronic band , which will sound an alarm if he strays more than 150 feet from his telephone . And in Georgia , Mississippi and New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with offenders performing manual labor in their communities . Even public humiliation is making a comeback . Last month a man convicted of a second burglary in Lincoln County , @# @# Ore. , was given a choice between jail or placing an advertisement in the local paper apologizing for his crime . Tom Kirby opted for the personal ad . " We have to search for alternatives that wo n't be too offensive to the public and still accomplish the purpose of punishment , " says Richard Hammersley , chief criminal deputy district attorney . In one sense , alternatives to prison have long been a staple of the justice system through the use of probation . But conventional probation , says Joan Petersilia , a senior researcher at the Rand Corp. , has given alternative sentencing a bad name . She found in California that about half the felons put on probation are convicted of another crime within three years . The fault , she says , lies with pathetically understaffed probation teams ; on average , officers juggle more than 10C cases . " It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never given a chance . Petersilia is cautiously hopeful about programs of " intensive probation " which can be found in 30 states . While they differ in detail , most rely on giving a select squad of probation officers small caseloads ? no more than 25 ? and charging them with keeping track of offenders who have strict limits on their freedom . Intensive supervision is n't cheap , and it has to be strict . In New Jersey 's version , for instance , officers have sent 20 percent of the probationers back to prison , proving that the state takes its rules seriously . Intensive probation costs about $6,000 per inmate annually , 10 times more than regular probation but less than half of a year 's imprisonment .  | Work programs also show promise . In New York City , for instance , judges can sentence repeat petty offenders ? shoplifters , car strippers , store burglars ? to 70 hours of community service . Work crews perform unskilled labor , repairing nursing homes , parks or neighborhood centers . About half of these laborers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional probation . " Judges are handing down more than 1,000 of these sentences each year , " says sociologist Douglas McDonald , whose book " Punishment Without Walls " will be published later this month . " This addresses the courts ' biggest problem : chronic offenders . The results are pretty encouraging . " McDonald estimates that the city program provides about 300,000 hours of unpaid labor each year . Several Southern states use work programs also , although the leading one in the region gives inmates a strong dose of prison , too . About 800 Georgia prisoners have gone through a " shock incarceration " program at the Dodge County Correctional Institution . It consists of doing hard labor on state roads and vigorous calisthenics in the gym . " After 90 days we want them to say , I do n't want to serve any more time ' , " says Larry Anderson of the Georgia Corrections Department . " And doing something that makes them a better person physically helps to instill some pride . " Good news : All of these programs face trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With careful screening , they can reduce the pressure on jail cells without forfeiting society 's right to punish . But these programs wo n't cure crime . Sociologist McDonald reports that about 50 percent of the work-program graduates in New York are arrested again within six months ? roughly the same number as those who come out of jail . On a cost-benefit basis , that 's good news : the same discouraging results for less money . Still , a miraculous conversion will occasionally occur . Richard Battle stole expensive suitcases to support his drug habit . After nine jail sentences a judge sent him to the community-service program . " Just the fact of getting there on time , working for nothing except the community made me feel like I was n't dumb , " he says . " That woke me up . " Now he 's an assistant director of a drug rehabilitation center . But do the positive statistics stem from good work or bureaucratic " creaming " ? How dependent are they on local conditions ? Politicians must demand answers , not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop that habit , maybe they 'll demand better performance from prison administrators , too .
