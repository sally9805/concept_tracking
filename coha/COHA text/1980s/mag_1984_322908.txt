Ever since a Royal Navy submarine torpedoed the Argentine cruiser General Belgrano during the 1982 Falklands war , killing 368 crewmen , the British government has maintained that the action was taken in self-defense .

Tarn Dalyell sent documents to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Commons suggesting that the government had withheld information about the Belgrano affair from the committee . Dalyell also alleged that British forces were not in immediate danger when they attacked the Belgrano .

Two top Royal Navy officers have denied the charges .
