 | America 's innocent vision of space travel is gone . It went in a flash and a fiery ball at 11:39.13 a.m. , on Jan. 28 , 1986 . In that instant , seven men and women who dared to break the bonds of Earth simply vanished , their passing marked by a 10-mile-high cloud that hung in the skies for hours . No longer , now , will we look at the rise of rockets as being as routine as elevators going up and down . Now we will know , when we reach for stars , the fears of Old World explorers who sailed for the unknown with maps of empty spaces warning , " Here be dragons . " The horror came home like the assassination of President John F. Kennedy , for , just as then , television captured clearly the 73-second ride to catastrophe . The world witnessed , over and over and over , astronauts die . These were not just pilots , paid to push the limits of flight , crashing in some desert . They were scouts of science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a schoolteacher who ventured toward the heavens with her son 's stuffed frog , her daughter 's cross , her grandmother 's watch and a lesson she had ready for beaming back to her classroom in Concord , N.H. Questions are arising over what all of this will do to the children who watched because a teacher was aboard the space shuttle Challenger . Will the next generation go into the void , questing for life 's origins and destinies ? Will this generation be pathfinders yet , knowing the price to pay ? In the aftermath , some , from pilots to the President , found solace ? and resolve ? in a sonnet by John Gillespie Magee , Jr. , an American flier in World War II who wrote at age 19 , just before he crashed and died ... With silent , lifting mind I 've trod The high , untrespassed sanctity of space , Put out my hand , and touched the face of God .  | First U.S. space ? flight disaster stuns nation Out of Challenger 's ashes full speed ahead America 's space program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blast that turned Challenger into a thunderbolt of splintered metal . What was to be the most glorious year yet in space came to an abrupt end the morning of January 28 . As a shocked world bore witness , the crew of seven perished in a shattering explosion . All that was left was debris floating in the Atlantic and a plume of purewhite vapor frozen in a deep blue sky ? the epitaph for a mission gone wrong . " Man will continue his conquest of space , to reach out for new goals and ever greater achievements , " said President Reagan , who joined grieving relatives at a Houston memorial service for the fallen crew . " That is the way we shall commemorate our seven Challenger heroes . " In the tragedy 's aftermath , however , all further flights were grounded until the cause is found . That could take at least six months . If the stubby-winged craft requires major design changes to make it safer , the program could shut down for a year or more while the three remaining shuttles are overhauled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embattled shuttle will arrive quickly . He must decide whether to ask Congress for a replacement . At a time of heavy budget cutting in Washington , the cost would be high ? at least $2.2 billion . There are other problems , too . The project would deplete existing stores of spare parts needed by the other shuttle craft and require cranking up an assembly line at Rockwell International 's California plant . Even if work began immediately , it would be 1989 before a new shuttle would be ready to put on the launch pad . And with one less shuttle on hand , the launch schedule would be considerably slowed . Ahead now is a period of grief , both for the nation and those ultimately responsible for the program . But past experience argues strongly that the critical examination of the shuttle in months to come may well lead to a renewed space effort . With firm support by Congress and the public , the shuttle ? developed at a cost of about $14 billion ? seems bound to fly again to pursue an ambitious new agenda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glory days of Apollo , Gemini and Mercury quickly reminded the nation that the space program has a history of rebounding from adversity . Out of the tragedy of the Apollo launchpad fire that killed three astronauts in 1967 , for instance , came a redesign that helped man get to the moon . That same retooling produced knowledge that helped another Apollo crew limp back to Earth when an oxygen tank ruptured during a 1970 moon shot . " A terrible price was paid , " says former shuttle flier Joseph Allen . " The legacy was a spacecraft that was extraordinarily safe . This has to be the same now . " For the time being , the military and industry , both major shuttle users , must find other means of launching payloads . But that will not be easy since there is an acute shortage of unmanned American rockets to take up the slack . While the military has little alternative , industry may be forced to turn to Europe 's Arianespace consortium , whose unmanned rocket already is fully booked through 1987 . The Europeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world launch market over the next decade . Big potential American users now include RCA , Western Union , COMSAT and GTE , whose fortunes are closely tied to the satellite business . U.S. space officials say they are determined to forge ahead once the shuttle receives a clean bill of health . " We 're dedicated to pressing on , " declares William Graham , acting administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration . Adds Senator Slade Gorton ( R-Wash. ) , head of a subcommittee on space : " I do n't think this will lessen the feeling of support in Congress . If anything , it will strengthen it . " " Advances in technology are always three steps forward and one step back , " says David Scott , who flew to the moon in 1971 . " This was a big step back , but it 's not the end . " A troubled history For an America that had become used to trouble-free shuttle launches , the program seemed to be a conspicuous success in an era largely devoid of U.S. achievement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life sciences and communications and moved man one  | step forward in his ability to reach beyond the moon in his exploration of the universe . But there is also a less positive side to the shuttle story . The program has been dogged almost from the beginning by massive cost overruns , lengthy delays and near disasters . Even its origins were marked by confusion and disagreements over what role the shuttle should perform . A fundamental question was whether it was essential to send humans aloft in the shuttle . The short answer always has been ? and remains ? no . Much information can be gathered by robots and other hardware . The question is whether the shuttle 's achievements have been worth the economic , and now the human , cost . " Brain still best " The Reagan administration remains convinced the answer is yes . Says Marcia Smith , executive director of the President 's National Commission on Space , which will issue its report in the spring : " No machine can sense the nuances that the human eye can , and react when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best computer . " Alex Roland , shuttle critic and history professor at Duke University , argues that both human and economic costs are too high to make a further commitment to build new shuttles . " The relative cost of sending humans into space is so much higher than sending machines , " he says . " I 'm not convinced that all the things we are doing in space today require humans to be up there . The astronauts are aware of the dangers , but most taxpayers are n't . " The idea for a manned shuttle emerged in 1969 when the U.S. was winding down the Apollo period and planning new space adventures . A principal element of the plan was to put up an orbiting space station to keep people in space but protect them from the hostile , cold vacuum of the environment . Originally conceived as a kind of utility truck to service the station , the shuttle ultimately evolved into something far different . Its design fell victim to the often conflicting demands of science , commerce and particularly the military . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mature before the essential design was frozen , " says John Logsdon , a George Washington University professor and longtime student of U.S. space policy . " Development of the shuttle took place in an environment that may have led to problems later on . " Partly as a result of their convoluted history , these complex and powerful machines can be troublesome . Although designed to endure the stress of launch and reentry , they are surprisingly subject to the whims of nature , particularly wind , rain and lightning . The fragile tiles needed to shield the shuttle from the inferno of re-entering the atmosphere can pop off if water gets under them and freezes . Crosswinds on landings are a constant worry for pilots of the shuttle . Its glide ratio , says one engineer , is not much better than " a pair of pliers . " The braking system has been another near constant problem , with major overhauls needed after many flights . Engine , fuel problems Last year , NASA did a major study that found that the main engines had not withstood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redesign . The engines , built by Rocketdyne , a division of Rockwell International , had problems including erosion , cracks and hardware fatigue . The engines were designed to operate for 55 missions before overhaul , but NASA scaled back that number to 35 and found itself constantly having to do major work on the main engines between launches . The engine builders , said the engineers who did the study , " simply did not anticipate all the problems they encountered . " Another warning signal came after a 1983 launch of the Challenger . Postflight investigation revealed that the protective lining inside a nozzle on one of the two solid-fuel boosters nearly burned away . That could have thrown the shuttle sharply off course or resulted in the kind of mishap that consumed the same orbiter last week . Moreover , the economics of the shuttle have never been efficient . In 1972 ,  | NASA chief James Fletcher predicted that shuttle launches would cost the taxpayer on average $10 million each . Today , based on one congressional study , the average cost per launch is $150 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record over four years and 24 safe launches and recoveries . They add that exotic technologies like those used in the shuttle always entail developmental delays . The redundancies built into the system to thwart any glitches are a top priority for NASA . Yet no one doubted that , someday , disaster would strike . " We were statistically certain we would eventually lose one , " says former NASA official David Williamson . Military blind spots The Challenger explosion carries serious implications for industry and the military , both of which have become heavily dependent on the shuttle . From a military perspective , the disaster raises serious questions as to whether President Reagan will be able to meet the timetable for research and testing of his Strategic Defense Initiative , the space-based antimissile-defense plan popularly known as Star Wars . A third of all shuttle missions through 1995 were earmarked exclusively for the Defense Department , and many of them were connected with Star Wars research . Private analysts such as Paul Stares , a space specialist at the Brookings Institution , says the disaster will also " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense to work without problems . " From the Soviet Union came similar sentiments . Although Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev sent a telegram of condolences to Reagan , the official youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda described the shuttle as " an integral part " of the Star Wars system and asked : " Will the President 's antimissile system be reliable ? " More immediately , the Air Force now has no readily available means of launching a second of the important spy satellites that monitor compliance with armscontrol treaties , watch troop movements and observe Third World hot spots . Only one of these KH-11 satellites is now in orbit , and if it malfunctions , say the generals , the U.S. would be left strategically " blind " in space . The Pentagon can now be expected to press even harder for expendable launch vehicles ( ELV 's ) ? the tried-and-true Delta of McDonnell Douglas , the Atlas Centaur built by General Dynamics and the Titan rockets of Martin Marietta . But while these rockets are cheaper and unmanned , they lack the shuttle 's pow- er to lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply problem . Stockpiles are low and production lines for some models have been long idle . Says analyst John Bosma , " All this has put the Air Force in a dangerous fix ? all the shuttles confined to hangars and no ELV backups . Meanwhile , the Soviets can put up 10 satellites a week using old-fashioned rockets . " Entrepreneurs in orbit Private industry , too , is going to feel the pinch . Business has frequently used the shuttle to orbit communications satellites , perform exotic-materials experiments in a weightless atmosphere and process pharmaceuticals . By the year 2000 , revenues from commercial space ventures were expected to amount to as much as $50 billion , much of it deriving from remote sensing , advanced communications systems , satellite servicing and space-materials processing . Companies such as McDonnell Douglas and Minnesota Mining &; Manufacturing have joint ventures to purify in space a drug that stimulates red blood cells . Deere &; Company has been studying the property of metals at zero gravity to improve its farm-machinery production on Earth . Before Challenger 's loss , aerospace companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smaller research , support and venture-capital companies have grown up in the shadow of the shuttle . The Challenger explosion further eroded the confidence of space insurers , who already had doubts about nearly every other aspect of the satellitelaunching effort . As a result , premiums most likely will again rise . Says James Barrett , president of Intec , an international underwriting firm : " The cost of the risk in space has proven to be much higher than most people expected . " Total insurance losses from failed satellites launched by the shuttle and unmanned rockets amount to $600 million over the last two years , he said . Computer clues and controversy At NASA 's Kennedy Space Center , investigators began scanning photos , debris and miles of computer tape for clues to the cause of the disaster . Speculation centered on photographic evidence that fire spread from booster rockets to the main fuel tank , which exploded with what one observation pilot described as the force of a " small tactical nuclear bomb . " Engineers are also examining the possibility that one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhinged and punctured the tank , leading to a series of explosions that ultimately engulfed the Challenger itself . However , it is also true that the Challenger 's cargo ? a $100 million communications satellite and an instrument to observe Halley 's comet ? was the heaviest yet carried . This record weight of 48,361 pounds may have contributed to strain on rocket engines or the shuttle 's structure . Officials at the Johnson Space Center in Houston are confident that slow-motion enhancement of videotape and close analysis of computer data are going to reveal the answer , perhaps as soon as mid-February . " Even if we ca n't find necessary debris , we 're going to piece together the trajectory , the thrust profiles , " explains one engineer . " We 'll be able to sort out the sequence , then we can play it through simulations and work it out . I suspect it 's going to be something subtle . It 's not going to jump out at us . " Whatever the cause turns out to be , those with close ties to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuttle will fly again . Comments former astronaut Joseph Allen : " This was the day that everybody in the business knew was going to come . As Chuck Yeager says , Progress is marked by great smoking holes in the ground . ' This is how knowledge moves forward . That has to be the legacy . "
