Sophie Wolf , 83 , is a small , solid woman with curly white hair . She speaks softly but forcefully in faintly accented English . One day not long ago Sophie visited Ellis Island . The cold weather reminded her of the raw foggy day 57 years ago when she saw Ellis for the first time . <P> She was Sophie Steurer then , 25 years old , one of eleven children born to a German hatter and his wife . They had lived comfortably in Ebingen , about 40 miles south of Stuttgart . But the inflation and unemployment that ravaged Germany in the 1920s changed all that . By 1923 a loaf of bread cost up to 3 million marks . Sophie could find work only half a day a week - sewing men 's shirts . Her friends sought jobs in The Netherlands and Spain . " But for me , " Sophie recalls , " America was the thing . " She was fortunate in having a sponsor : an uncle who ran a bakery in Madison , Ind . He paid for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove to the U.S. that she would not become a public charge . <P> With only one suitcase , filled with clothing and favorite photographs , she set sail from Bremen on the steamship Munchen . " I had seen the Rhine , but this was the biggest puddle of water . " The ship reached New York on Dec. 11 , 1923 . The spectacle of the Statue of Liberty and the New York skyline lavishly lit up at night seemed to be a sign of America 's astounding wealth . " At home , lights were out after 9 , " says Sophie . Her overwhelming sensation was fear : " If you did n't pass the tests , they would send you back . " <P> For a place once so feared , Ellis Island has a surprisingly welcoming air today , though most of its 35 buildings have badly deteriorated from decades of neglect and vandalism . It would take an estimated $150 million to save them all . " It sure looked better then , " admits Sophie . The low-slung main building of warm red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in air and light . Trees and lawns sweep to the gently lapping waters of the harbor . But at the time , immigrants like Sophie did not notice such things . They simply felt lost , especially in the great registry hall , where 5,000 immigrants a day were processed . A constant babble of incomprehensible tongues rose like flocks of starlings to the ceiling . Sophie did not speak English , but managed to comply with directions : " I just followed the pointing . " <P> " It was so impersonal , " she says . <P> " Bring the cattle in and ship them out . " There was a rapid legal examination . In two minutes , inspectors aided by interpreters fired 29 questions at a newcomer . Among them : " Are you an anarchist ? " And the trick question : " Do you have a job ? " A few proud would-be citizens could truthfully answer " Yes . " But a yes answer raised suspicion that the newcomer was a strikebreaker-or had been conned into a slave-labor agreement .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
