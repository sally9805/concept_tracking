Others will exhort you to take risks , to be yourself , never to look back or lose your faith . Not I. If the truth be told , I do not want you to take risks . Oh , maybe a selected few to preserve your selfesteem , but not the killing kind of risk , nothing netless . <P> As for being yourself , that 's fine , as long as you are happy with yourself . Otherwise , be someone else . You 'll find your way ; most everyone does . Never to look back ? I 'd say look back quite often . <P> If you do n't look back , you wo n't know it was you who smashed the china . Never to lose faith ? Of course you will . People lose their faith . <P> So what truth can I give you , my college-boy-to-be , on your way out ? You 'd think I would be able to produce something . <P> Words are supposed to spill from writers ' minds like shrimp , especially on momentous occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . Instead , I reach in my desk for some verbal pocket watch to wrap up for you in tissue paper , and come up blank . Too dazed or polite , you stare at my face the way Telemachus must have stared on the beach at Ithaca , searching for Ulysses among the sailors . <P> Should I offer you wishes ? Poets have done that for their children from time to time . In Frost at Midnight Coleridge wishes his son Hartley a life surrounded by nature . I could wish the same for you , though I have less trust in nature 's benevolence . <P> Still , Mary McCarthy said something interesting in an interview recently , that " our perception of the world and our values stem absolutely from the possibility of some reasonably true perception of nature-which is gradually disappearing and will soon become impossible . " That could be so . Myself , I like watching the ocean . <P> Yeats wished for his girl a sense of ceremony and tradition in A Prayer for My Daughter . I 'd repeat that wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a snob , like Yeats . In This Side of the Truth , Dylan Thomas , probably hoping to protect himself , wished that his son Llewelyn would hold all judgments in abeyance . " Each truth , " he wrote , " each lie , dies in unjudging love . " That I will not wish for you . <P> Have your love and your judgment too . <P> If not wishes , how about aphorisms ? <P> Everyone can use an aphorism . I wish I could remember one , something especially Delphic or brilliant from The Consolation of Philosophy , the Bhagavad Gita , the Koran . Charlie Chan said : " Evidence like nose on anteater . " Does that count ? Russians are better at such things . Once in my earshot Lillian Hellman observed : " A crazy person is crazy all the time . " I have frequently found that valuable , particularly when in the company of a crazy person who is , for the moment , lucid . Confucius said : " Filial piety is the constant requirement of Heaven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
