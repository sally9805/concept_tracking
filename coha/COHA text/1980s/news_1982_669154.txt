Recognizing that high-technology wizards are often the ones most baffled by the mechanics of a simple sentence , Ms. Almazol opened her Communications Training Consultants in the heart of the San Jose area ' s ' ' Silicon Valley ' ' last year . Although most of her clients are from the surrounding technical firms , including entire companies and professional groups such as Sylvania and the Society of Women Engineers , they have included a sprinkling of teachers and lawyers as well. // ' ' Everyone , it seems , is afraid to get up and speak , ' ' laughs the petite , dark-haired Ms. Almazol when asked why her services have found such a varied demand. // On a more serious note she attributes her success to the growing importance of effective communication in career progress . ' ' Business , for example , is using more visual presentations than ever , ' ' she says . ' ' Many firms are now more people conscious than they once were . Electronic companies are now sending their engineers out to speak to groups of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sales people about the technical products they sell and thus equipping them to answer questions out in the field. ' ' // The need for better communication has also sprung from the explosion of information that has occurred in many fields , she adds . ' ' The more there is to know , the more important it is for technical employees within one company to share their knowledge. ' ' // But despite the growing importance of clear writing and effective speaking in even the most technical of professions , communication skills are still all too often ignored by graduate schools and other training programs . ' ' I am constantly talking to engineers who tell me the math and design courses they had were simply not enough , ' ' says Ms. Almazol . ' ' Having to write reports and make frequent oral presentations was not something many of them bargained for. ' ' // Whether her clients are engineers , business executives , or lawyers , Ms. Almazol uses seminars and individual consulting sessions to help provide what their education did not . Clients most frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often begins with learning to get nervousness out of the way. // ' ' When people learn to control their nervousness by using certain simple techniques , they find that they actually are less nervous , ' ' says Ms. Almazol . Some of those techniques include learning the correct way to stand before a group and , the most common problem of all , what to do with the hands . Ms. Almazol advises clients to keep their feet pointed toward the audience , a means of ensuring that they will face the people they are speaking to rather than a visual aid or other object . As for hands , she recommends keeping one hand in a pocket and the other out. // ' ' If it sounds a bit like choreography , it is , ' ' she says . ' ' I help people plan their movements because the correct use of hands , eyes , and feet are all important elements of giving an effective talk . Even knowing when to smile makes a difference. ' ' // Men and women seem to be equally troubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the consultant . ' ' Men who are nervous tend to get wooden in front of a group , and so they don ' t show it very much . But women grow more and more flustered . Men often need to learn to appear more lively , whereas women often need to tone themselves down. ' ' // Many of her female clients face other speaking problems that men usually do not . ' ' Women often have to learn to say things more assertively , ' ' she says . ' ' They don ' t use their voices as powerfully as they can and should . They also have a tendency to swallow the ends of their sentences. ' ' // In any case , Ms. Almazol tells her clients that a touch of nervousness is all right , even preferable . The worst thing is to be so relaxed and blase that you look bored . ' ' Then what choice does the audience have ? ' ' she asks. // During her consultations Ms. Almazol considers her videotape equipment to be an indispensable tool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how they actually look and sound . ' ' It is quite an eye-opening experience to see how you come across to others , ' ' she says . ' ' People have images of themselves that are often quite different from what they project . Often they imagine themselves to be as they were five or six years ago . Sometimes a client will make a simple change in hairstyle after seeing a tape ; at other times the change is more complex , such as striving to appear more authoritative and mature. ' ' // A common problem Ms. Almazol encounters in both the speaking and writing aspects of her service is that clients tend to use sentences that are much too long and convoluted . To get them to use shorter , more concise sentences , she often has clients work with a partner who repeats everything the other has said . ' ' What happens is that , if you have expressed more than one idea in a sentence , the other person has a hard time repeating it back to you , ' ' she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aren ' t able to understand and follow what you are trying to get across. ' ' // Along with encouraging conciseness , she often teaches clients to translate their technical jargon into language their audience or readers will more readily understand . ' ' Many times people don ' t even realize that the words they are constantly using are jargon words . I advise them to explain technical situations by using analogies , often humorous ones . At first many technical people balk at the idea because they are afraid the audience will feel they are talking down to them . But the feedback they get is that most people enjoy the analogies . It is surprising how a complex idea can be phrased in quite a simple way. ' ' // Another service Ms. Almazol provides is to get clients to use their voices in ways many have never attempted before . ' ' People often get into the habit of speaking in a single monotonous tone , ' ' she says . ' ' They don ' t begin to tap all the variations that can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To develop a variety of tones , she often has her clients practice simple drills such as reading nursery rhymes aloud . ' ' Anything in which the meaning is chiefly derived from the way in which it is read is good practice , ' ' she says. // Despite the success her firm has so quickly found , Susan Almazol is a newcomer in the field . A former newspaper reporter , she entered a graduate program in speech communication at the University of Michigan , where her husband was also a graduate student . Entering it chiefly out of curiosity , she emerged in 1976 with a master ' s degree and a desire to make communications consulting her career. // After she and her husband , Dr. Octave Baker , returned to her native California , Ms. Almazol found work teaching technical communications courses at the Stanford University and University of Santa Clara engineering schools . A combination of teaching and employment at a consulting firm preceded the founding of Communication Training Consultants early last year. // Since then her positive approach to a subject often dreaded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Part of it is getting rid of the notion that speechmaking is a very formal , rigid activity , ' ' she says . ' ' Speaking to a group doesn ' t have to be that way at all . In fact , it can be quite conversational and relaxed . What does count is doing it in a competent way. ' ' // //
