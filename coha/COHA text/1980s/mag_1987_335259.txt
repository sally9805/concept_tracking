Last year 's tax reform was supposed to simplify tax paying , and so it did . But the paperwork ? Well , that 's different . The new 1040 forms to be used by taxpayers next April 15 , designed to look as much like the old 1040s as possible , were released by the Internal Revenue Service last week . In fact , filling out these forms will be just as complicated as ever . <P> In line with tax reform , the new 1040s will include five income brackets , instead of 15 . Many of the intricate old deductions , including the write-off for state sales tax , are gone . But supplemental income schedules contain a welter of new instructions . What does the IRS , fresh from the humiliating recall of its W-4 withholding forms , have to say ? The changes , pleads Arthur Altman , head of the IRS group that redesigned the forms , are a " reflection of what Congress has given us. "               @ @ @ @ @ @
