Profiles of typical drug users , in the newspapers and on TV , obscure the fact that many users are n't typical . I used to do coke with a violinist who was the most sheltered woman I 've ever known . My mushroom connection was a fifty-year-old school-bus driver . And one of my high-school buddies , who moved $1,000 worth of drugs a day in and out of his girlfriend 's tattoo shop , would always extend credit to transients and welfare moms ? debts he 'd let slide after a while when they were n't paid . It 's easy to start thinking all users are media stereotypes : ghetto trash , neurotic child stars , mutinous suburban adolescents . Users , the media imagine , ca n't hold jobs or take care of their kids . Users rob liquor stores . Real users , for all their chilly scorn of the straight world , buy into the same myths , but turn them inside out . The condescension becomes a kind of snobbery : we are different from the straight people , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventurers . When 1 was twenty-four , which was not that long ago , my friends and / thought nothing was more hip than drugs , nothing more depraved , nothing more elemental . When we were messed up , we seemed to become exactly who we were , Gail Regier 's short stories have appeared in the Atlantic and other publications . He teaches in the English department at Auburn University . and what could be more dangerous and splendid ? Other vices made our lives more complicated . Drugs made everything simple and pure . Anyone who hangs around drugs learns not to think too much about all this , learns to watch the bent spoon in the water glass . Some of the users I knew - .1 were people with nothing left to lose . The rest of us were in it only a little for the money , more than a lot for the nights we would drive to one place after another , in and out of people 's parties , looking for a connection . It was a kind of social life , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common was drugs . Getting high bound us together against outsiders , gathered us into a common purpose . No one else understood us and we understood each other so well . New Year 's eve 1979 : We 're riding around ? I have changed the names of those mentimed here for obvious reasons , stop where I used to work . The high-school kids who work there always have grass and pills . Their stuff is not so hot , but it 's real cheap . Restaurant people have a high rate of casual use ; the work 's so menial you ca n't stand it without getting high . The place is full of tired truck drivers and travelers with whiny kids . The hookers wear miniskirts and army jackets and all have colds . Our favorite waitress , Sherry , combines two parties to get us a booth . She 's telling some truckers at the counter about her sexual problems with her husband . They tell her to wear leather panties and she sighs and says that does n't work . Fleetwood Mac songs shake the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the scam ? Brian puts thumb and forefinger to his lips and mimes a toke from a joint . She goes hack to the kitchen , and when she comes back tells us that Larry is holding . We take our coffee with us through the door marked AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL . Everybody in the kitchen is drunk . Two of the girls are playing the desert-island game : If you could have only two drugs for the rest of your life , what would they be ? Sherry pours us some cold duck from a bottle that was in the walk-in cooler . There was a time when the rap here was all baseball and dates , but not anymore . Tonight the drizzle of abstractions is as vacuous as any graduate seminar . The kids say the owner gives them shit for coming to work stoned . They need their jobs but they know how they want to live . I tell them that the Church of Drugs has its own rituals and rules , and its members are a martyred elite . Brian tells Sherry about acid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it 's his starter or his alternator that 's bad . The kids listen . They are impressed by us . They want to be like us . Drug dealers on TV are vampires : oily , smooth , psychotic , sexy , human paradigms of the narcotics they sell . Larry is a skinny punk who is studying auto body at the vo-tech high school . Wearing a GMC cap and a long , stained apron , he stands behind a grease-blackened grill covered with steaks and bacon and skillets asizzle with eggs . " Watch this shit , " he tells another aproned kid , and motions to us to follow him . The kid protests that he 'll get behind . Larry leads us back to the storeroom , past shelves of #10 cans and signs that read ALL DELIVERIES C.O.D . and ABSOLUTELY NO FIREARMS ALLOWED ON THESE PREMISES . He takes a baggie from his gym bag and shows us some speeders he says are pharmaceutical .

Eighteen-wheelers grind and hiss their gaudy lights onto the interstate . Diane , a sloe-eyed , peach-skinned fifteen-yearold , comes out and vamps us for a couple of hits . I tell her about those cocaine nights when the room fills with snowflakes sifting down slow as if they were under water . She 's kissing Brian and I 've got my hand up her short skirt , but she refuses to get in the car with us . Downtown by the hospital , we get in a confusion with some ambulance guys with their cherry top on . Bald tires skid on the wet pavement . Brian decides to let me drive . We stop at my house , where my wife is watching Dick Clark 's New Year 's Rockin ' Eve . Her eyes are red from crying , but she tries to smile . " Dan and Jan were here , " she says . " Do n't you remember we invited them ? " I look in the refrigerator for wine . There is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I say . " I 've got to run them home . " " Then will you come back ? " " Come with us if you want . " I know she wo n't . Our son 's asleep upstairs . " Do n't get speed , " she says . " We 're not . " " You get mean when you do speed . " I want to get wired . I head for the door . We make the Steak N ' Ale . In a real city there would be black guys pushing stuff on the sidewalk out front , but this is Springfield , Missouri , and we ca n't score . The manager , our connection , is n't around . At the bar we order shots of whiskey . The place is full of pretty girls , and even the ones who do n't drink are drunk , but we 're not looking for girls . Guy says , " We should go see Casey . " Casey is an old guy who sold black-market penicillin in post-war Europe . Brian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he fusses about that . But Guy and I are studying on how good Casey 's crystal meth is and how Casey could get us a set of points so we could hit it . On our way we boost three wine glasses and a bottle of Korbel from somebody 's table . Sitting in the car , we drink to ourselves and the dying year . Brian wets his fingertip in the champagne and strokes it gently round and round the rim of his glass , making space noises rise from the crystal . We all do it , but then the noises turn spooky and we get paranoid . We drop the glasses out the window and drive . Prudence is sitting on the front porch watching the rain . She kisses me and I taste her tongue . I introduce my friends and she kisses them . " Casey 's inside . " " Has he got meth ! " She shrugs . The business is Casey 's gig . Prudence is twenty and has a cat named Lenin and a one-year-old baby . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casey : evening attendant at a laundry near the college . Her place is the cleanest in town . My buddies and I would drop in to wash some jeans and score a little pot , and end up hanging around all evening eating candy bars and flirting with Prudence . On the weekends Prudence ran a perpetual carport sale , things she made and stuff taken in barter from customers with cash-flow problems . Clothes and belt buckles , pipes and bottles , bootleg eight-tracks and cassettes with typed labels , old skin nags , car stereos and CB radios trailing cut wires . The living room is brightly lit as always ; Prudence leaves her pole lamps on twenty-four hours a day . Casey is sprawled among pillows on an old couch ripe with cigarette scars , culling sticks and seeds from some dope on the glass-topped coffee table . Framed beneath the glass are large-denomination bills from several South American countries . Casey 's favorite objects litter the shelf below brass pipes with small screw fittings , ceramic ashtrays from the commune at Ava , a rifle scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A candy dish holds pills ? speckled birds and bootleg ludes coloring a base of Tylenol with codeine , bought over-the-counter in Canada . Casey offers us some , and I sift thumb and forefinger carefully through the pile and pick out two black beauties for tomorrow . Brian starts to take a handful and 1 sign him not to . Casey scarfs codeine the whole time we talk . Prudence and I go to the kitchen to mix a fruit jar of gin and orange juice , stay there a lit tle while to touch and neck . She has painted everything in the kitchen white , wails and floors and cabinets and fixtures , and in the glare of many bare bulbs the room is stark as a laboratory . White-painted plaster peels off the walls in loops and splinters . There are no dishes or pans ; Prudence buys only things she can cook in her toaster oven . Last time I was over , Casey went after Prudence with a ratchet wrench and I had to talk him down . As we mix the drinks she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now things are better . He 's even starting to like the boy . I tell her how my four-year-old thinks acid is the best trick going , because when I 'm tripping I play with him so much . We take baths together , drenching the floor with our bathtub games , while my wife sits on the toilet lid , watching us with her bright blue eyes . On the floor , Lenin and the baby take turns peekabooing and pouncing . I 'm surprised the baby is n't scared . I 've changed my mind and dropped one of the beauties and I 'm feeling edgy and fast and tricky . Lenin rubs himself against my ankles and I grow paranoid . " You want to help me water the plants ? " Prudence asks . We climb the rungs nailed to the closet wall , push up the trapdoor , and crawl into the attic . Gro-lights illuminate twenty marijuana plants set in plastic tubs . Casey has run a hose up through the wall . I turn the water on and off for her as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knees . Downstairs , I can hear Brian on a rap . " Radiation will be the next great vice . They already use it with chemo to kill cancer . Soon they 'll discover wavelengths that reproduce the effects of every known drug . The cops will be able to spot users easy ' cause we 'll all be bald . " Prudence digs out a Mamas and Papas tape ciety dedicated to discovering the Flesh Tree described in an ancient Mayan codex . This is the rare and sacred plant from which human life originally derived . According to Burroughs , flesh is really a vegetable , and the human system of reproduction is a perversion of its true nature . Casey talks very seriously about acquiring his own Tree of Flesh on his next trip to Mazatlan , He regards the story as journalism rather than parable ? or seems to . We spend some time discussing how to care for the Tree of Flesh once Casey obtains it . Guy asks Casey about the crystal meth . " You do n't want speed , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What you want is a hit of junk . " Guy shakes his head , but Brian looks thoughtful . " For ten minutes , " I say , " you 'll be as high as you ever thought you wanted to be . Then in half an hour you 'll be as high as you really ever wanted to be . " " And then ! " Guy says . " You 'll want more . " Inside the Church of Drugs , heroin users are an elite within the elite , saints of Instant Karma and Instant Death , Their stark games raise them to a place beyond the hype and chatter . " When you shoot up , " I tell them , " you 're alone before the abyss . That 's what shooting up is for . " The first time I shot up was the most frightened I 've ever been . For me the feat was part of the high . Guy and Brian have never done needles , but Brian is hard for it and helps me work Guy around . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assure him . " Just in muscle tissue , like a vaccination , " We each give Casey a twenty . He drags an army-surplus ammo box from under the couch and rummages through it . Prudence puts the baby on the rug and goes to hunt up a needle . When she returns with one , Casey measures out the heroin and I cook it in a teaspoon dark with the flames of many lighters . When it is like molten silver , Casey loads , taps bubbles out of the rig , and hits Guy in the shoulder before he can change his mind . Brian thrusts his arm forward eagerly , his eyes ashimmer with the romance of drugs , and I put the needle in him . They both vomit , the way almost everybody does when they get their wings , then go serenely on the nod . The baby is startled and then amused by their upheavals . We get them settled and empty the bucket we had handy for them , then Casey and Prudence hit each other . She has a glass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table when the spasms hit her . Last to do up , I take my time , pricking the point of the needle into the vein of my inside forearm , easing back a little before I push the trigger . Wisps of blood claw up in the glass wanda year without smoking a joint . I got out of drugs the way a lot of people do . One day I looked around and saw that I was missing a lot of work , my nerves were bad , parties bored me , all my friends were druggies . I quit selling and then I quit using . You know the story . Prudence still lives in Springfield , in the same house north of the railroad yards . Casey is gone but the carport sale continues . Her boy is ten , and maybe there are some fine white scars at the corners of his mouth . Maybe they 're just my imagination . When I quit drugs I thought the fighting in my marriage would stop . It did n't . It was n't the drugs my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Drugs provided . She still wants me home . I 'm still not there . One night last year when I did n't want to go home , I took a manic-depressive writer on a ' shroom run to a stucco structure known as the House With No Brains . Everyone there was younger than me . Some folks had heroin and tried to missionary us into doing up . I just said no , but for weeks after that ? listen , this is important ? for a long time after that , I thought about junk , talked about it to people , started once to drive to the House but turned back . Every time I picked up a spoon or struck a match , I thought about needle drugs , about how clean and fine things could be .
