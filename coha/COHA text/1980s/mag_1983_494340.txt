WHITE HOUSE WATCH RUNNING REAGAN IN EARLY 1982 , when President Reagan 's approval ratings had descended to 45 percent , five points lower than Jimmy Carter 's at a comparable stage in his Presidency , there was talk among pundits and politicians that Reagan might be a lame duck . Now , with Reagan 's approval ratings at or above 60 percent , some of the very same people are forecasting a 1984 landslide . The truth , of course , is that it 's foolish to depend on polls to predict the distant future . Prudently , neither Reagan 's own campaign organization nor those of his Democratic rivals is preparing for anything but a close election . Reagan 's campaign director , Edward Rollins , formerly chief of the White House political office , has been thinking about the reelection since January and holding meetings with other top Reagan officials about it since March . He was formally asked to run the campaign in late May by Senator Paul Laxalt , its general chairman , and by White House Chief of Staff James Baker and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so later , the President 's pollster and strategist , Richard Wirthlin , had his first intensive campaign-planning lunch with Stuart Spencer , the California consultant who 's sometimes called the " political godfather " of the Reagan Administration . Over the summer , Wirthlin worked on the first draft of his 1984 campaign plan , now in its fourth revision . The main document , of which there are supposedly only four or five copies , is about two hundred pages long with sixty or seventy pages of appendices , and is bound into a black hardcover book . Its first lines say that " a campaign plan should neither be chiseled in stone nor written on sand , " and according to Wirthlin the document will be updated many times again between now and election day , November 6 . A SO last summer , Rollins and his deputy , Lee Atwater , consulted with officials of the Nixon and Ford Administrations to learn how an incumbent President should and should n't run . Except for the free-flowing cash and Watergate dirty tricks , Rollins says , the 1972 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " one of the all-time great campaigns . " This time though , the Reagan-Bush ' 84 campaign and its finance committee are under unified command , and the effort is tied in much more closely with the Republican National Committee , with Senator Laxalt serving as chairman of both . And this year , unlike in some previous Republican campaigns , great efforts were expended state by state to assemble Reagan organizations representing both top elected officials and old-time Reagan loyalists and to smooth out conflicts where they occurred . On November 7 the Reagan campaign named committees in all fifty states , which Reagan managers say is the earliest such a thing has been done in any Presidential campaign . In other senses , too , the Reagan-Bush campaign is a sophisticated operation . It was officially launched on October 17 , and within a week had qualified for federal matching funds by raising $5,000 in each of twenty states in contributions of $250 or less . Even though President Reagan has no primary opposition , the campaign intends to raise and spend all the $21 million in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than $3 million with an initial direct mail appeal sent out November 18 to six hundred thousand contributors . Along with the Republican National Committee and the party 's Senate and House campaign committees , Reagan-Bush has a list of 2.2 million proven donors to which it can turn for funds , a huge number . The campaign has eighty-eight full-time employees , posh offices , and a preliminary plan to register more than 3 million new voters ? all before the President has announced that he will run . That will happen on January 29 , four days after Reagan delivers his State of the Union address . President Reagan 's reelection prospects , though , depend more on his performance as President than on his campaign organization . And while his reelection committee has been running smoothly , the White House has not been . There has been one flap over the tenure of the President 's chief economic adviser , Martin Feldstein , and another over his treatment by the rest of the White House staff . Chief of Staff James Baker considered leaving to become , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Gergen and chief Congressional lobbyist Kenneth Duberstein are departing . FELDSTEIN , at latest word , is not leaving soon , even though it appeared for a time that his resignation was being sought by Baker and his deputy , Richard Darman . Both of them agree with the Harvard economist 's view that the President 's $200 billion budget deficit poses a threat to economic recovery . They also believe in team play , however , and wanted Feldstein to stop giving comfort to the Democrats by publicly advocating higher taxes which the President had ruled out . Even though Feldstein was treated roughly , he apparently wants to remain in office and is willing to confine his objections to the President 's inner councils . Even though it seems ridiculous that a White House chief of staff would leave to become baseball commissioner , particularly when he is scheduled to play a major role in the reelection campaign , Baker aides say he really did consider the offer , mostly out of exhaustion . Of all Reagan appointees , Baker appears to have aged the most since 1981 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less constantly with counselor Edwin Meese over who would run what in the White House , though he finally won out . During parts of the second and third years , Baker fought ? though less intensely than with Meese ? with National Security Adviser William Clark over both policy and power until Clark finally retreated to the Interior Department . All the while , Baker has been performing not only the functions of a chief of staff , but some of those of a chief executive too , such as conducting negotiations with Congress . And all the while he has been under attack from conservatives inside and outside the Administration because he allegedly has diverted the President and his policies from an ideologically pure path . Baker tried to succeed Clark as national security adviser in hopes of gaining foreign policy experience and putting himself in position to be Secretary of State , Secretary of Defense , or Treasury Secretary in a second Reagan Administration . He was blocked from the N.S.C. job by Administration conservatives , though presumably he still could get a top cabinet post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reelection campaign . The most frequently mentioned possible successor to Baker is former Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis , now president of Warner Communications , chairman of the Reagan reelection strategy committee , and another skilled government pragmatist sure to come under conservative fire . Gergen and Duberstein , moderate Republicans and Baker subordinates , also have been targets of conservative rage . Both , too , have contributed to Reagan 's success inbroadening his appeal outside the right wing of the Republican Party . Duberstein has done so with Congress , and Gergen with the press and public . Since election years often are do-nothing periods in Congress , Duberstein 's absence is likely to be less damaging than Gergen 's in 1984 . Gergen 's talents lay in concocting public relations strategies to make the President seem competent and caring ? not always the easiest of tasks ? and in selling these images in background briefings for reporters without ever telling a lie . Gergen quit , reportedly , because he disagreed with the policy of restricting press coverage of the Grenada invasion and the President 's ordering of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lebanon policy leaks . He performed his job superbly , and it 's not at all clear that it can be done as well by Deaver and Darman , who have other administrative functions to perform . Whether he deserves it or not , President Reagan is heading toward election year in strong political condition , considering that he has presided over the deepest recession since the 1930s and has ordered American troops into combat for the first time since 1975 . Wirthlin reported to the press on December 7 that his polling showed Reagan has a 62 percent approval rating and leads both Democratic front-runners by 14 points , 52 percent to 38 percent . Wirthlin acknowledges that the successful Grenada invasion boosted Reagan 's popularity , but calls it the " afterburner " to a rocket that was already soaring toward 60 percent . He noted that the Iranian hostage crisis boosted Jimmy Carter 's popularity four years earlier from 29 percent to 56 percent , indicating by comparison that Reagan had a better initial base of support before Grenada and surpassed Carter 's levels after the invasion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They say that in order to win with 50.7 percent of the popular vote , as he did in 1980 , Reagan needs to receive at least 80 percent support from Republicans , 25 percent from Democrats , and 50 percent from independents , and that he currently is scoring 80 , 29 , and 55 percent , respectively . Among voters in union households , Reagan got 40 percent in 1980 and is scoring 45 percent now . The Reaganites acknowledge that the President is doing less well among women than the 48 percent he got in 1980 , but is doing five points better among men than his 53 percent in 1980 . " The key thing for us , " said one campaign official , " is to convince Republican and independent women that the economy is really getting better . E.R.A. and the other feminist issues are not the trouble . It is that men believe the President 's economic program has helped them , but women do n't . " In spite of Reagan 's generally favorable showing in the polls , both his and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some columnists sense . According to Walter Mondale 's pollster , Peter Hart , " Reagan gets a 63 percent approval rating according to ABC , but the same poll shows him beating Mondale by only 50 to 44 and Glenn 49 to 46 . If the man is so strong , why is he leading by so little , especially when he 's President and the other party 's nominee has yet to be picked ? " According to Hart , Reagan 's popularity loses its luster when key constituencies and issues are considered . " Fairness is a beachhead for the Democrats , " Hart said . " The public is 60 percent against him on that . When you ask people whether he is getting us any closer to peace , they say he is not . The elderly are against him on Social Security , and the minorities are against him . He 's also lost his consensus for defense spending on the defense-waste issue . " According to Hart , " I thought people were crazy last summer when they said Reagan was dead , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's got it made . " Reagan campaign officials agree , and most of all they concur that foreign policy is likely to be the most difficult issue that Reagan faces . " We face a very worrisome international scene , " a Reagan campaign official said . " There are a lot of dynamics that we ca n't control , especially in Lebanon . We assume the Russians will not want to face four more years of Reagan , and will do what they can to destabilize areas of the world and force Reagan to take action that might be unpopular . Reagan is not as vulnerable on the peace issue as he was pre-1980 and pre-Grenada . He 's been proving that he is not a trigger-happy fool . " Reagan may not seem irresponsible now , but he could seem incompetent eleven months from now if Lebanon or some other policy goes tragically awry . Under those circumstances , Reagan could lose even if his challenger did not seem appreciably more competent in foreign policy than he did . After all , that is how Reagan won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
