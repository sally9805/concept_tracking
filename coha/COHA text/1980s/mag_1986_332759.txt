Talk about the high expectations of new parents . On the morning that Eva Burrows was born in an Australian mining town , her father , a Salvation Army officer , was conducting a worship service . Within minutes the father returned to his home , held the newborn baby aloft and uttered a prayer dedicating her to the glory of God and the salvation of the world . " It was rather a tall order for a little baby , " says Burrows with a grin . <P> Burrows , 56 , faces her tallest order yet in her new post as general , or worldwide commander , of the Salvation Army . Chosen over six male nominees last month by the denomination 's 48-member high council , Burrows is only the second woman to hold the top post since a military-minded Englishman ( and former Methodist minister ) named William Booth founded the evangelical Christian group in London in 1865. * <P> The Army , whose headquarters are still in the British capital , encompasses 86 countries in a social-welfare network that includes clinics , centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the aged , food services for the poor , and mobile teams to aid refugees and disaster victims . Burrows faces the task not only of continuing such help but of pumping new life into an organization whose ranks are thinning . " If we 're not growing , we must feel guilty , because we are not fulfilling Christ 's demand , " says Burrows . <P> Today the Army reports 1.5 million adherents worldwide and about 16,800 active officers ( the equivalent of clergy ) , down from nearly 18,000 in 1968 . Europe has fared the worst , losing 33% of its officers in the past 15 years . In the U.S. , the officer ranks , the largest of any country , have declined slightly , to 3,703 . The U.S. operation has 29,000 other employees , and 1985 revenues were estimated at more than $500 million . <P> What Burrows will not change is the Army 's religious philosophy or its military structure . The revival-minded Protestant group holds strictly to an eleven-point orthodox statement of doctrine and a literal interpretation of the Bible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuns all services of baptism and communion . <P> In Army parlance , committed lay members are " soldiers , " prayer meetings are " knee drills , " and officers and soldiers take a pledge known as the Articles of War . Salva <P> tionists do not die ; they are " promoted to glory . " Burrows also has no intention of dropping the group 's paramilitary uniforms , which vary from country to country . " Some people say the uniform is a Victorian appendage , but it is part of our awareness of being a militant church , " says Burrows . * <P> The new general did not come to her vocation easily . One of nine children , she was impressed when her mother brought home destitute people to share the family 's spartan meals . But as a teenager , she recalls , " I felt the Salvation Army discipline was too rigid , and for a good deal of time , I refused to go to church . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
