Before the end of the century , the commission predicted , " genetic screening and counseling are certain to become major components in both public health and individual medical care . " The time " can already be envisioned , " it said , when all information about a person ' s " abnormal " genes and chromosomes will be readily accessible. // The commission said genetic screening raised " important ethical and legal concerns " about who should have access to the tests and the information the tests reveal , whether tests should be voluntary or compulsory , and what the tests should be used for . It threw its moral weight against using genetic tests to choose the sex of a child or produce a superhealthy race of people. // Up to now , genetic screening has been used sometimes to test newborn infants for a few rare genetic diseases or to screen selected population groups , like Jews or blacks , for specific genetic conditions that afflict them more often than the general population. // But the commission predicted that a screening test for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in hand by the end of the 1980 ' s , thus making possible " a new program of mass genetic screening of vast proportions . " Various tests might be used on prospective parents , pregnant women or newborn infants , depending on scientific advances and practical considerations . Just how they will be administered and who will pay for them are problems that remain to be worked out . <> <> More and Better Tests // Cystic fibrosis afflicts about one in every 1 , 800 newborn babies ; it damages the lungs and digestive system and generally kills its victims before they reach the age of 20 . A screening program primarily for whites of reproductive age , the group at highest risk of bearing infants with the disease , could conceivably require tens of millions of tests in a short period. // The commission called such a task " daunting in itself " and warned that " it is merely the harbinger of a still greater demand " that will inevitably develop as scientists devise more and better tests " to determine personal susceptibility to particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offspring. " // The recommendations were set forth in a report , titled " Screening and Counseling for Genetic Conditions , " issued for release Monday by the President ' s Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research . The 11-member commission is headed by Morris B. Abram , a New York City lawyer , and includes individuals prominent in medicine , theology , law and public affairs . It was created by Congress in 1978 , started work two years ago , and will go out of business at the end of March. // In its wide-ranging 115-page report , the commission found that " on the whole , " advances in genetics " have greatly enhanced health and well-being " and that genetic screening techniques " give Americans new opportunities to understand their biological heritage and to make their health care and reproductive plans accordingly . " <> <> Ethical Guidelines Proposed // But it proposed a broad array of ethical and practical guidelines to insure that new and existing screening technologies would yield safe , effective , equitable and beneficial results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The report focused on genetic screening for medical and reproductive purposes . It did not address the issues raised by genetic screening of workers to determine susceptibility to chemical damage in the workplace or by screening used for research purposes. // In general , the commission argued that medical screening programs should largely be voluntary , that genetic information should largely be kept confidential and that access to screening services should be equitable . But it noted that these principles sometimes conflict , and it offered these specific recommendations for resolving difficult cases and for changing current practices to make them work better : // - The current practice of limiting amniocentesis , a test for diagnosing the health of a fetus , to women age 35 or older should be re-evaluated to make it more available to younger women . The original notion that 35 is the age at which the risk of bearing a defective child rises sharply has been supplanted by more recent understanding that the risk rises gradually with increasing age. // - The use of amniocentesis for sex selection " should be discouraged . " Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing parents to abort a fetus of unwanted sex , the practice is " morally suspect " for a variety of reasons apart from the abortion issue. // - Screening programs may focus on particular racial or ethnic groups that have a high incidence of a genetic disease without violating principles of equity and fairness. // - Men who donate their sperm to artificial insemination programs should be screened more thoroughly so that the risks of transmitting genetic disease can be minimized and women can be apprised of the dangers. // - Adoption laws should be changed so that information about " serious genetic risks " can be communicated to all affected parties . Currently , adoption records are often sealed by the courts , thus making it impossible to convey information on a newly discovered genetic condition to either the child or its original biological parents , depending on circumstances. // - Individuals screened should be encouraged to release genetic information that would benefit their relatives ; if they refuse , it may sometimes be ethically acceptable to release it anyway to avoid serious harm to other individuals. // - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious harm to the defenseless , such as children. // - Genetic information should not generally be provided to insurers or employers without the permission of the person screened . In addition , the commission said , mandatory screening is not justified as part of a program to produce a " genetically healthy society " or other " vague and politically abusable social ideals.
