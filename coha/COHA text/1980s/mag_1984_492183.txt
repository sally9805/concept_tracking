58 THE SATURDRY EVENING POST October ' 84 A little past five o'clock on the afternoon of October 11 , 1978 , a young black woman shuffled on the arm of a friend into the emergency room of Alvarado Community Hospital , in San Diego , California , and asked to be admitted for psychiatric help . Her name , she said , was Sheila Allen , her age was 24 and her complaint ( as later interpreted and standardized and noted on her chart ) was " bizarre behavior , with looseness of thought associations and severe depression associated with suicidal thoughts . " She was admitted after a brief examination to the psychiatric wing , and was made comfortable there in a double room . The following day , and for several days thereafter , she was examined , tested and variously observed . The results of these evaluations were inconclusive , and on October 16 a member of the psychiatric staff named Robert Brewer was appointed attending physician . " I went in to see her after rounds the next morning , " Dr. Brewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed  --  sitting there with the help of a nurse . She was tall , with a beautiful figure , a beautiful face and beautiful , wide-apart eyes . She was also pathetic . She did n't seem to have any strength at all . She could n't walk . She could hardly sit up . She could hardly lift her arms . I introduced myself and made some getting-acquainted talk . I took her history and did a routine physical and checked her mental states . She was just as weak as she looked . She was well oriented and alert . There was some evidence of conversion hysteria . I finished upwith a lot of history and a lot of problems , but no strong impressions in any direction . I was inclined to go functional , but not entirely . I did a residency in neurology , and I always try to keep the organic possibility in mind . I started thinking ' multiple sclerosis . ' Her age , for one thing , was right . Multiple sclerosis is a young person 's disease . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen long enough your patient will usually tell you what the trouble is . So I asked her what she thought was her trouble . She said , ' I 'm a kook. ' 1 said , ' Maybe so , but before we go that road I 'd like you to see a neurologist I know . ' She almost blew up . 1 think she might have hit me if she 'd had the strength . She said , ' I do n't want to see a neurologist . I 've seen a dozen neurologists . I 'm a kook . I 'm in the kook hospital . 1 want you to fix up my kookiness . ' But I was n't convinced . And that afternoon 1 called Fred Baughman , the neurologist I had in mind . " I met Sheila Allen in the spring of 1983 , some five years after that pitiful outburst . We met , by prearrangement , in San Diego , in the office of Dr. Brewer 's neurological colleague Dr. Fred Baughman , Jr . She looked good  --  the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she had ever been otherwise ) of kookiness . " Oh , I was , " she told me . " I was a kook . I had to be , after what I 'd been through . If a person can be driven crazy , that was me . But , of course , I was n't really crazy . I was simply in despair . 1 had been sick for so long  --  for almost four years . I was getting sicker and sicker . I was almost helpless . I went to Alvarado Hospital because I could n't think of anything else to do . I had finally given up . " I do n't know when my trouble actually started . I mean , it came on so innocently . l guess it began in Dallas sometime in 1974 . No , I 'm not from Dallas . I. was born in the Chicago area  --  in Maywood , Illinois . But when 1 was 14 my parents moved to Los Angeles , and 1 went to high school there . I ran track , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've always loved to run and dance and bike and that sort of thing . I went to Cal State , at Northridge , for a year , and I studied physical education . I went to Dallas because I wanted a change . There were no problems at home , or anything like that . I just wanted a change . I got a job at a Sears store , demonstrating cosmetics . Then a friend told me that Braniff was hiring flight attendants . I had an interview , and they hired me and sent me to their school  --  six weeks of emergency procedures , first aid , posture , grammar , how to prepare the meals . I was based in Dallas , and I flew every stop between there and Chicago and sometimes New York  --  all over . I think March of 1974 was when the trouble first began . 1 was out dancing one night , and my legs gave out on me. 1 mean , I fell down . But I was able to get right up , and I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I went to lower heels , and then one night it happened again . It was just like the first time . I was able to get right up and go on . Nobody seemed to think anything of it . So I was n't really worried . But when I had my regular Braniff physical in August I mentioned it to the doctor . He gave me an extra-careful checkup and passed me . He said I was in great shape . He said I was probably just tired  --  too much standing . Well , flying is all standing . You hardly ever sit down on a flight . So that made sense . But then my legs began to hurt . I was n't just tired , I also hurt  --  at the end of a flight , or walking through the airports . Like O'Hare . Or , especially , Dallas . You know how big it is . We were always having to walk from Gate I to Gate 22 . My legs would cramp . It was a real tight pain . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of minutes . Then I 'd be all right . But all the girls were always complaining about being tired , so I still did n't think too much about it . Until it began to affect my arms . Just lifting two trays , and my arms would begin to tremble . It seemed like they did n't want to hold . Even a coffeepot was almost too much for my strength . I tried to get more sleep . But I just got tireder and tireder . And I began to almost miss flights because I had to sit down so often along the concourses and rest . So what I did was just get up earlier . If there 's one thing I 've got , it 's will power . I drove myself as hard as I could . But I was getting worried now  --  real worried . I went to a doctor one of my friends knew . He said to take it easy . Stop driving myself so hard . He gave me a prescription for Valium . " That would have been around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating right . It 's hard to eat right when you 're flying . All too often , after we had served the passen- gers their lunches or dinners there would n't be any food left . Most of the girls carried candy bars for those emergencies . I carried what I called my survival package  --  tuna fish and peanut butter and crackers and raw carrots and lots of vitamins . A lot of the girls recommended a shot of bourbon at bedtime . I tried that , and it was all right , but I could n't see that it helped me any . I had to realize that my tiredness was different from the other girls ' . So finally  --  I think it was in October , or maybe November , of 1975-1 tried again . I went to an orthopedic specialist . I told him about my legs , how weak they were  --  and my arms . He looked me over ; he was very thorough . But he could n't find anything wrong . He said it was probably my job  --  the standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to quit , to take a leave or something . But I loved flying . I loved my job . And I loved the money . I had a little Opel GT sports car . I had a nice apartment . I had a wonderful life . So I kept on working  --  getting to the airport early enough so I could make it to the gate , and getting back home late  --  and resting every chance I got . I stopped talking about my problems to the other girls . I did n't want them to say anything . I wanted to keep my job . But I was only fooling myself . It was just too much for me . In February of 1976 , I asked for a vacation , and they gave me three weeks ' leave . I went to my favorite place  --  to Hawaii . I relaxed and rested and tried to enjoy myself . The three weeks went by , and I was the same as always . 1 just did n't have any strength . I went back to Dallas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had personal problems . Which was true enough . My sister Enid flew in from L.A. and drove me home in my little Opel  --  back home to my parents . " It 's hard to explain just how I felt . I was worried about feeling so tired and weak . But I still really thought it would go away . I still really thought I 'd get better . Anyway , I could n't just sit around the house . That is n't my way . I went out and got a job  --  two jobs , as a matter of fact . I got a daytime job demonstrating cosmetics again . I worked in various stores doing make-up . And at night I worked as a cocktail waitress in a club . I suppose that was kind of foolish . Because I had the same old trouble  --  the same problem with trays , the same problem with all the standing and walking . I had to wear heels at the cocktail job , and , of course , that made things that much worse . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could tell when it was coming on-1 'd think , There goes the tray . The other waitresses dropped things , too . But they only dropped a glass or something . I dropped the whole tray . But the boss was crazy about me . That made everything O.K. This was in the summer of 1976 . But finally the boss got to be too much for me . I had to quit . I had already quit the cosmetics job . Two jobs were too big a load for me , and the cocktail job paid better . When I quit that , I got a daytime job as a hostess in a restaurant at the beach . I guess I knew by then that there was something really wrong , but I wanted to work . I missed that airline income . It 's hard to change when you get used to a certain level of living . " When I first came home to L.A. , I had gone to the family doctor . He could n't find anything wrong with me . Then I met a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He checked me out and could n't find any ing wrong , either . He referred me to a woman psychologist . She gave me an IQ test . That only told her that I was bright . So she gave me another test . And then another . She never seemed to try to think anything out  --  she just kept giving me tests . I // decided she was a waste of time , and quit . I also quit my hostess job . I had to  --  I was getting weaker every day . Everything I did hurt . It hurt to comb my hair . My arms were so heavy and weak . It was hard for me to drive my car . Once or twice , it was really frightening . I 'd try to brake or something , and my foot would n't move . One Sunday afternoon , I took my little three-year-old niece to the park . When we were driving home , a traffic light up ahead turned red and I started to brake and I could n't lift my foot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to kill us both . I told my niece to get down on the floor . I hung on to the wheel and we sailed across the intersection . Thank God , there was nobody coming . I do n't know how I ever made it home . That was the last time I drove . I was at home now all the time . But I had problems even there . I do n't know how many times my legs gave out and I fell down the stairs . They were carpeted , thank God , so I was n't hurt much . That was going down . Climbing the stairs , I practically had to crawl . My mom was a problem , too . She kept saying I was just trying to upset her . She did n't really mean that . The real reason was that she could n't bear to think there was something wrong with me . And my sisters . We would be getting ready to go out somewhere , and it took me so long to get ready they 'd go off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot . I 'd try to pick up a glass , and my arm would go limp . And I 'd say , ' Oh , nol ' ? and fall into a chair and just cry . " But I still had n't given up . When I quit going to that woman psychologist , my chiropractor friend suggested I see a psychiatrist . I was going out with the chiropractor some , and he was really trying to help . He was convinced that my trouble was psychosomatic . I did n't know what , to think . Some days I was better , and some days I was worse . Some days I could get dressed and go out and everything was almost like normal . Then the next morning I could n't even fix breakfast . I had a drawer full of prescriptions  --  Valium , Elavil , Equanil , all those drugs . Every doctor I went to see prescribed something . I tried them all and I could n't see any difference . I could n't see that any of them helped . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the doctors I 'd seen were white . Some were black . Anyway , I went to this psychiatrist once a week . We talked . We went over everything I 'd been told by all the others . He said I must face it  --  I had a psychosomatic problem . I liked him ; he was a nice man . He made me feel better about myself , which helped . But I did n't really believe what he said . Then I had my family  --  my mother and my brother and my three sisters  --  on me . They made it perfectly plain . They said I was crazy . I said to myself that they were crazy . " About that time , in December of 1976 , 1 met a nice guy from San Diego . He was a big guy-6 ' 6 " and 270 pounds . His name was Ira Watley , and he had been playing offensive tackle for Miami . He 'd just got cut . He was going back home to San Diego , and he suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knew they were driving me nuts . I thought about it . Then one morning I woke up and I almost could n't get out of bed . But I made it , and started down to breakfast , and fell . I fell all the way down the stairs . I did n't know whether I was hurt or not  --  I hurt all over anyway . I must have looked awful , because my mother helped me up and took me to the emergency room of a hospital a few blocks away . There was a young doctor on duty . He examined me , and everything  --  my arms and legs and all . He said to wait , and went away . He came back with a textbook and he stood there studying it . Then he said , ' I would think you might have myasthenia gravis , but the symptoms are n't right . Myasthenia gravis starts with the eyes and face , with drooping eyelids and trouble swallowing . You do n't have that . ' He said he thought I ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Elavil . " That made up my mind . I went to San Diego with Ira . He was really understanding . He wanted to get married . I did n't think so  --  not right then . But I was feeling a little better and getting a little restless . I wanted to do something . Ira suggested I go to school  --  to a business college he knew about . So I enrolled . That was in February 1977 . But it was the same old story . I was n't really any better . The school was on the second floor  --  a walkup and those stairs were too much . I would go late , so people would n't see me struggling . It was one step and rest , another step and rest . Some days , I could go three steps without resting . I was taking typing . And finally I could n't do it . I could n't hold out my arms . It was a three-month course , but I never finished it . After that , I just stayed home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already seen a couple of doctors in San Diego . One was a regular internist . The other was a neurologist . They were like all the rest : psychosomatic , Valium . But Ira kept pushing me to keep trying to get some help . I even went to a doctor in La Jolla who tried to hypnotize me . I would n't hypnotize , and that frustrated him . He told me I did n't want to get well . Then I tried an orthopedic surgeon . He asked me to lift my arms . I could n't do it . He stumped out of the room . He said he could n't help me because I would n't cooperate . Then I tried another psychiatrist . I had four or five visits . The psychiatrists and the psychologists were all alike : What did your last doctor say ? I see . Well , I agree . Psychosomatic . I 'm going to give you a prescription for an antidepressant . Some of them started with my childhood . Some started now and worked back . I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood . I told them I did n't hate my parents , and they did n't hate me . They were loving parents . The psychiatrist I went to four or five times , he saw Ira when Ira brought me to his office . I told you Ira is a very big man , So this doctor had a new idea . He asked me if Ira beat me . " I started getting completely worse in June  --  June of 1978 . Ira was away . The Winnipeg Blue Bombers had signed him on , and he was training up there in Canada . He had arranged everything before he left . He had his father come over and look after me . He sent me his check every week , and one of his friends  --  either Frank or Drake  --  would take me to the bank and to the supermarket , or wherever . Frank was very sympathetic . He had been in Vietnam and had had a hard time there , and he 'd had some therapy . He persuaded me to try the state mental-health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while . But the classes were kindergarten stuff , and I would n't take the drugs they offered . Elavil was one of them , and it actually seemed to trigger more weakness . It seemed to actually loosen my muscles . I had some bad experiences even without drugs . I 'd sit down in a chair , and when I wanted to get up I could n't . I 'd have to wait for Ira 's dad or somebody to help me . It got so I was afraid to cook . I remember one afternoon I had some vegetables on the stove . I left the kitchen and fell , and I could n't get up . I just lay there smelling them burn . The house was full of smoke when Ira 's dad came in and turned off the stove . It was an awful feeling . I was n't good for anything . I used to sit and meditate and pray . I 'd fix my mind on , say , fishing or shopping , and try not to think of anything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the Lord 's Prayer over and over and over . It helped me , I think . I prayed in bed in the morning , too . I kept a Bible by the bed . In the morning , when I woke up , I 'd read or pray , and finally I 'd have the strength to get up . One morning , I could n't comb my hair . I did n't have the strength . I finally had to lay my head on the sink , and that way I could use my arms a little . There was another time . Drake and his brother Lee took me fishing with them out on the park dock . After a while , I went to the bathroom . I sat down on the toilet , and I could n't get back up . Nobody came in . I yelled and yelled , and finally Lee came in and got me out . " I think that was about the last time I went out anywhere . I knew I was reaching the end of the line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rest more and more . I knew that pretty soon I 'd be helpless . I had to do something before it was too late . I decided my only hope was to get hospitalized . And I knew that the best way I could get hospitalized was to talk depression and suicide . That was one thing I 'd learned from all those psychologists and psychiatrists . The hospital I picked was Alvarado Community Hospital . It was the nearest one to Ira 's apartment . I got Frank to drive me there , and he had to practically carry me into the emergency room . I told my story , and they took me in . I remember that date . I remember it very well . It was Wednesday , October 11 , 1978 , late in the afternoon . But the date 1 really remember is the following Wednesday , October 18 , around noon . That was the day I met Dr. Baughman . He came into my room and looked me over and told me what my trouble was . I had myasthenia gravis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to me . " It was almost as quick and easy as that . 1 was pretty sure the minute I saw her that her trouble was myasthenia gravis . The only other possibility was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , and she was much too young for that . " Dr. Baughman is a slight , wiry man of 50 , with a bang of sandy gray hair and a wide , warm , country-boy smile . He was smiling now . " But it was n't magic . Myasthenia gravis is a special interest of mine . I trained at Mt . Sinai , in New York , and Mt . Sinai has a rather famous myasthenia-gravis research laboratory . Some important work has been done there . So I learned about myasthenia gravis early , and it is always on my mind . There is a saying about diagnosis  --  about why doctors often fail to recognize one of the less common diseases . It goes , ' When you hear hoofbeats , you do n't necessarily think of a zebra . ' I recognized the hoofbeats of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say myasthenia gravis is a common disease . But it is n't a rarity , either . The national occurrence rate is one in 20,000 . I see my share , because I 'm a neurologist and because I 'm aware . I average three to five new cases a year . Women seem to be more susceptible than men ? particularly young women . Myasthenia gravis is a good descriptive name . The ' my ' refers to muscle , and ' asthenia ' come from the Greek for weakness . It is n't as gravis  --  as serious  --  a disease as it once was . It was first described in the 17th century , and it was named around the end of continued on page 94 // the 19th century , and in those day and up until the middle 1950s it was very often fatal . There is a treatment now . But , of course , it ca n't be treated if it is n't diagnosed . That 's the problem . In that respect , Sheila was a classic case . " I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and said he had some doubts about a psychiatric patient at Alvarado , and would I take a look . So the next day I went up to Four South when I finished my regular rounds . The first order of business is the visual impression . And oh , Lord ! She was pathetic ? truly pathetic . She was lying in bed and not exactly crying  --  sort of whimpering . There was a feeling of just hopelessness . Her beauty made it all the worse . 1 knew the moment I saw her that there was a profound , generalized muscle weakness . I called a nurse , and we got her sitting up . She tried to help , but it was a genuine , real weakness . Nothing functional about it . Her face was normal , and so was her speech . There was a slight nasal character , but not much . I had the nurse get her to her feet and walk . It was a definitely abnormal gait  --  it was a waddle . That indicated a hip-girdle weakness . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then trace , then poor , then fair , then good . Sheila 's hip and shoulder girdles were poor to fair . Her body and feet were in the good range . The weakness was symmetrical , and there was just no question about it . I knew her history , and I did n't believe a word of all those psychiatric evaluations . This was a serious muscle disease . " It 's sad to think how close she came to an early diagnosis . I 'm talking about that young doctor up in Los Angeles . He suspected myasthenia gravis , but he made the common mistake of going entirely by the book . The books all emphasize that the presenting symptoms are drooping eyelids , facial weakness and palatal weakness  --  difficulty in speaking . The classic teaching requires the presence of one or more of those symptoms for a diagnosis of myasthenia . I had one patient who was referred to me by an ophthalmologist . A man had come to him complaining that he was losing his eyesight . The ophthalmologist recognized that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myasthenia gravis . I wish the textbooks were a little less rigid . But the fact is that a mere suspicion of myasthenia is enough , because there 's a quick and easy diagnostic test that is almost entirely reliable . " Myasthenia gravis is a fundamentally mysterious disease . l mean the basic cause is unknown . It is generally thought to be one of the several auto-immune diseases  --  the consequence of some disturbance in the body 's immune system . Antibodies appear in the blood that interfere with the supply of a substance called acetylcholine , which mediates neuromuscular function . I 'm putting a highly complicated process in very simple terms . The result of this inhibition is a weakness much like the weakness induced by the poison curare , and the treatment of myasthenia gravis has derived from an understanding of curare intoxication . The site of the physiological defect in both curare poisoning and myasthenia gravis is the neuromuscular junction . In the absence of acetylcholine , the muscular reponse very rapidly decreases . A period of rest will , at least for a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only for a limited time . Then the weakness returns . Drugs have been developed that are antagonistic , in varying degrees , to the substance that inhibits acetylcholine . One of these anti-cholinesterase agents is involved in the diagnostic test for myasthenia gravis . Tensilon  --  or , generically , edrophonium chloride  --  has the power to restore almost normal muscular function almost instantly , in a matter of moments . Its effect lasts only moments , but a positive response to Tensilon is diagnostic of myasthenia gravis . " Tensilon was developed at Mt . Sinai in 1952 , and I 've used it many times . The effect is always startling . 1 gave Sheila the usual dose  --  ten milligrams , injected intravenously. 1 waited a moment , and then checked her arm strength . There was resistance to pressure  --  maybe 80 to 85 per cent of normal . So I asked her to get up and walk . She said , ' You know I ca n't walk . ' I told her to try . She gave me a doubtful look  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked across the room . It was a miracle . It 's always a miracle , but this was one of // the most miraculous . I 'll never forget the look on her face . She was dazed . She was stunned . The tears were running down her cheeks . I felt the way I always do when I see that miracle happen . I felt  --  I do n't know  --  almost godlike . Then she began to give out . I helped her back to bed . She collapsed . It was all over . " Sheila Allen was discharged from Alvarado Community Hospital on the morning of Thursday , October 26 , 1978 . That was 15 days after the day of her admittance and 8 days after her dramatic noonday meeting with Dr. Baughman . In the course of those 8 days , she was introduced to another , and more durable , anti-cholinesterase agent , called Mestinon , and an effective dosage ( one 60-milligram tablet every four hours ) was determined . Tensilon is of only diagnostic value . The discharge summary noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Dr. Patricia Marrow for supportive psychotherapy ( in adjusting to the presence of a chronic debilitating illness ) and by Dr. Fred Baughman for control of myasthenia gravis . " Her condition , the summary added , was " markedly improved . " It was indeed . The friend who had helped her into the hospital was there to meet her on her departure . She was pleased by his thoughtfulness , she was glad to have his company , but she did n't need his help . She walked out of the hospital with the easy gait of any normal 24-year-old woman . She was , for all practical purposes , a normal young woman , and two weeks later , in early November , she was leading a normal life . She had a job demonstrating cosmetics at a San Diego department store , and she was attending evening classes at a school for real-estate brokers . Dr. Baughman saw Miss Allen at his office soon after her hospital discharge , and once a month thereafter . At their December meeting , on December 5 , he noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was better than that of many other patients in his experience , and inferior to none . Nevertheless , he watched her closely and questioned her closely at their monthly meetings . There is always a chance that Mestinon , or any other anticholinesterase agent , may in time weaken in its mastery . There is a surgical procedure that can provide a vigorous supplement to Mestinon therapy . This involves the removal of the thymus gland . The thymus is one of the endocrine glands and is situated in the windpipe , just below the thyroid gland . Its function has to do with the development and maintenance of the immunological system . The thymus develops rapidly in infancy , grows more slowly until around puberty and then , in most people , begins to wither away . It has been established that in victims of myasthenia gravis the thymus is abnormally intact , and its functions seem to have been pervertWhere do you think you are ? ed into the phenomenon of autoim community . In the course of the summe of 1979 , Dr. Baughman decided tha ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thymus , and he ar ranged with a thoracic surgeo named David M. Long to perform th operation . Miss Allen was admittes to El Cajon Valley Hospital on Sep tember 25 and underwent a transcer vical thymectomy the followin morning . The operation was a corn plete success , and its good result ' were immediately apparent . Dr. Baughman noted that within less than two hours Miss Allen 's muscular powers were stronger than at any tim since he had diagnosed her illness . On September 29 , she was discharged . " Oh , sure , " Miss Allen told me toward the end of our talk in Dr. Baughman 's office . " 1 knew that a thymectomy was a serious operation . Dr. Baughman told me all about it . But of course 1 agreed . Whatever he suggested was gospel to me . He was the messiah . He is the messiah . I moved back to Los Angeles in January of 1980 , but we keep in touch ? I 'm still on Mestinon ; I always will be  --  and 1 see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel better every day . When I moved back to L.A. , I had finished my real-estate course , and I went in with my mother and father in their real-estate business . I also did volunteer work for a while in a hospital in the neighborhood . I did physical counseling . Then , in 1982 , I heard about a new airline opening up with flights between L.A. and Hawaii , and I applied , and they took me on . I 'm a senior flight attendant , and I do seven turnabout flights a month . Between trips , I still work in real estate . The only trouble I have now is trying to hold myself back . I do n't want to walk  --  I want to run . I 'm so full of strength and energy . I guess I 'm making up for lost time . I told my new boyfriend about my myasthenia . He said , ' So what ?
