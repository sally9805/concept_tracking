In the final analysis , it was never really a championship series . The Atlanta Braves may have been winners of the National League West , but they certainly didn ' t have the class of the St. Louis Cardinals , who mercifully completed a sweep of the NL championship series here last night . While returning to Ted Turner ' s playground may have restored the smiles to the Braves ' faces and revived the festive mood that has surrounded the club all year , the truth is that all the Braves gained were a few new subscribers for Turner ' s cable TV system next year . Last night ' s 6-2 victory by the Cardinals was mostly a matter of grim determination . They had a job to do and they did it . Clutch pitching stopped the heart of the Atlanta power machine , with Dale Murphy , Bob Horner and Chris Chambliss going a combined 4 for 22 . Clutch pitching was a guy named Joaquin Andujar , who kept the Braves inside the " Launching Pad , " as Cardinal manager Whitey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was a superb relief pitcher by the name of Bruce Sutter who , for the second straight time , shut down the Braves and picked up a save . Timely hitting made the sweep seem like a stroll to the grand ball . The three double plays that St. Louis pulled off last night didn ' t hurt its cause any either . The Cardinals outhit Atlanta , 12- 6 , and the much-maligned Willie McGee emerged as the eventual hero with a two-run triple and a solo home run . Catcher Darrell Porter was named most valuable player of the series . The victory , before a disappointed crowd of 52,173 , earned the Cardinals a berth in the World Series , opening tomorrow in St. Louis , against the American League champion Milwaukee Brewers . St. Louis will be making its 13th trip to the World Series , which it has won eight times . Atlanta dropped its sixth straight game in postseason play , having lost in three straight to the New York Mets in 1969 . Only one team in playoff history - this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has come from an 0-2 deficit in these series . At Busch Stadium , the Cardinals depended on turf hits and lucky bounces . Last night , they virtually wrapped it up in the second inning when McGee ' s two-run triple highlighted a four-run outburst . It was more than enough for starter Andujar , who survived a line drive off his left leg in the second and stayed around six innings before leaving with a 5-2 lead . Sutter took over with two out in the seventh and retired the last seven men he faced . McGee ' s triple followed a single by Keith Hernandez , a walk to Porter and a run-scoring single by George Hendrick . McGee eventually scored on a base hit by Ozzie Smith . By winning , the Cardinals reached the World Series for the first since 1968 , when they lost in seven games to the Detroit Tigers . The last St. Louis world championship was in 1967 when it beat the Red Sox in seven games . After the victory , the Cardinals broke into a traditional celebration of champagne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat subdued . " But that ' s because we ' ve been a club all year that doesn ' t get too high or get too low , " said Ozzie Smith , the splendid shortstop . " We ' re happy and excited . But we ' re also a little tired . I ' m glad we ended it tonight . I don ' t think anybody wanted to play a fourth game here . " We ' ve come a long way . But the journey is not over , yet . We ' ve got another hurdle in the World Series , so it ' s good to be going home to get a day of rest . " To a man , the Cardinals expressed the opinion that their winning was not the result of any one man , although each added that Sutter ' s ability to stop teams in their tracks was a key all year . " This is a perfect Cardinal win , " said second baseman Tommy Herr . " We ' re not a team of home run hitters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . We don ' t have one hero . We have 25 . " If the Cardinals had to point out heroes , they might be pitching coach Hub Kittle and his scouts , who figured out how to pitch to the dangerous Braves so that they never found their stride after a roller-coaster ride in the AL West . The Braves failed to hit a home run in the three games . " Scouts are a great thing , " said Porter , who went 5 for 9 in the series and walked five times . " But a lot of what they suggest depends on whether or not the pitchers can execute . The guys put the ball where we wanted in all three games . " Murphy is a tough hitter and , basically , we tried to establish the inside against him . He hit some balls well , and that is where your defense comes in . The guys were in perfect position to stop him and the rest of the Braves . " Herzog said the courage of Andujar last night was something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being nailed by Chambliss in the second . " He did his usual creditable job , " said Herzog , " and I was able to get to Sutter about the right time . I never like for him to go more than six batters . He went seven tonight , but that ' s all right . The sweep helped me avoid a difficult decision . I would have been forced to pitch Bob Forsch with less than his usual four days rest , and now I don ' t have to . " The victory by the Cardinals put Herzog into his first World Series . He had three near misses with the Kansas City Royals . " It feels awfully good to be on the plus side , " said Herzog . " The difference with this team is Sutter . The Yankees always came at us with aGossage and , in a short series , that means a lot . When we ' re in trouble , I just looked to old No. 42 , and knew he ' d do the job . " I ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what kind of club they were in coming back and winning three straight . They ' re an excellent hitting team , just like the Braves , but if our pitchers do the same consistent job they did these last three games , we ' ll be OK. "
