J. Bennett Johnston has a message for George Bush . Stripped of the sweet words whispered to any new President during his honeymoon , the bad news is this : Read my lips . You go first . <P> " The deficit is a time bomb with a lighted fuse , " says Johnston , the senior Senator from Louisiana . " Bush 's tendered solution , his ' flexible freeze , ' is deja voodoo all over again . The idea that we can grow our way out of this mess is absolute nonsense . If Bush really believes he can do what has to be done without cutting into entitlements and defense and without raising at least some taxes , then he 's smoking something . And if he thinks we Democrats are going to drag him kicking and screaming into taxland and take all the heat alone , then he 's dreaming as well as smoking . " <P> Johnston 's is more than merely another voice added to an already deafening chorus . He is a leading power in a body that will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that promises Bush greater resistance than Ronald Reagan ever faced . Few if any Senators believe Bush 's content-free campaign won him a mandate . And none believe Bush possesses the communications skills that permitted Reagan to pitch successful appeals beyond Congress for public support . <P> Johnston is also running a highly visible race for majority leader in an election to be held next Tuesday . His prospects are impossible to determine  --  the ballot is secret and double crosses are common . But even if he loses to George Mitchell or Daniel Inouye , the other contenders , Johnston 's opinions on a range of issues are significant . As a Southern moderate , Johnston is the kind of Senator Bush needs if his programs are to have any hope of passage . And unawed as he is by Bush , Johnston fairly reflects the mood of Congress . " Bush should consider the possibility that ( ( we will ) ) keep his promises for him , " says New York Democrat Pat Moynihan , reportedly among those supporting Mitchell for majority leader . " And that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much care how Bush retreats from his no-tax , no-cuts campaign promise , as long as he does so . " The most statesmanlike thing to do in politics , " says Johnston , " is to tell the truth during a campaign . After you 've concluded that you ca n't win that way , the second most statesmanlike thing is to borrow from Earl Long and tell the people you lied . " Johnston does n't expect Bush to ape Long , but he does expect him " to set the stage and move by degrees . At some point , possibly under the cover of the National Economic Commission or an economic summit between the White House and Congress , Bush could tank his campaign dribble and say , ' Well , I thought we could do it my way , but it turns out we just ca n't . ' " <P> The crunch could come in May , when Bush will be in need of Senate votes to raise the national debt ceiling above $2.8 trillion . Like a hanging , a hike in the debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , says Johnston , unless the President " comes to us and swallows hard about raising revenues . When he does that , that 's when we 'll cooperate . " <P> How could Bush not cave in ? If a budget stalemate develops because both the President and Congress hang tough , mandated Gramm-Rudman reductions will force an estimated $40 billion in cuts . Defense , the area Bush most wants to protect , will take half of that blow .
