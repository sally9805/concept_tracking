Appearing on a television talk show recently , Betty Friedan mentioned in passing that women are opening new businesses at a faster rate than men are . TIME Reporter-Researcher Leslie Whitaker , who happened to be watching , immediately picked up on the remark . She called Friedan , who told her that she had got her statistics from the Small Business Administration . " When the SBA verified that women were in fact the most dynamic portion of the small- business community , " says Whitaker , " I knew I was on to a good story . " The result : this week 's special report on women entrepreneurs , who these days are running everything from fashion conglomerates to asphalt-paving firms . <P> The half-dozen TIME reporters who spoke to the businesswomen behind the stats heard tales both harrowing and inspiring . " They have frequently beaten the odds , " says Whitaker , " working with less capital , less training and fewer contacts than their male peers . They 've created their own opportunities . " Few saw their success as a triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of themselves as business people first and females second , " says Reporter Blake Hallanan , who conducted interviews in the West and Southwest . Washington Correspondent Gisela Bolte agrees : " The women did not strike me as profeminist or antifeminist . Their only cause is to make business work for them . " <P> Staff Writer Janice Castro , who wrote TIME 's special report , brought a family interest to the subject . " It never occurred to me that women could n't succeed in business , " says Castro , whose grandmother was running the office of a San Francisco chemical firm in 1914 , when she was only 18 . Castro 's parents co-managed a small meat company . While in college , Castro dreamed of running her own business , but the journalist 's notebook won out over the balance sheet . <P> For Hallanan , who would like to start her own magazine someday , the stories she heard will serve as guidance about what to do  --  and what not to do . But then Hallanan also has a role model closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm since 1984 . " Many of those I spoke with saw starting a business as an outgrowth of the balancing act that so many of them perform at home , from budgeting the grocery list to planning family vacations , " she says . " Being an entrepreneur and a woman can be a 36-hour-a-day job . "
