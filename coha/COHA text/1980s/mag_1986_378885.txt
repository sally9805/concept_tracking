Until his death in 1980 , Cy Taillon was known to the initiated as the " World 's Greatest Rodeo Announcer . " Around the circuit , which could extend from Puyallup , Wash. , to Baton Rouge , La. , and into Madison Square Garden itself , no exhibition of bronco riding or calf roping seemed quite complete without Taillon 's booming , animated commentary . He became something more than legendary to those who followed the sport . Said one admirer : " I do n't know what God looks like , but I know what He sounds like . " In 1977 his daughter , Cyra McFadden , created a literary stir with her first novel . The Serial , a wry look at some laid-back suburban lives in California 's Marin County . There was not much in this book , frankly , to attract die-hard rodeo fans . On the other hand , it seems fair to assume that most of those who bought and enjoyed The Serial had never heard of Cy Taillon . <P> Rain or Shine should change all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfying reconciliations . Author McFadden , 48 , not only portrays and then patches up the quarrels and estrangements that raged between her and her father , she captures the tawdry colors of the Old West and mourns their fading . She looks back on her parents ' tempestuous marriage and divorce , both of which baffled them and her as a child , with tolerance and wisdom . And her storytelling skills give Cy Taillon the posthumous gift that he would have most appreciated : the chance to appear in front of a new audience . <P> By the time Cyra was born in 1937 , her parents had been knocking about the rodeo trail for six years . Her father was handsome ( he later doubled for Robert Taylor in horse-riding scenes for the movie Billy the Kid ) . Her mother Pat was beautiful , a Southern belle who had left her hometown in Arkansas because she had " tired of grits " and had gone on to succeed as a chorus girl in St. Louis . <P> All the ingredients were here for a B-Western version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first home was the midnight blue 1937 Packard that carried her parents from one raucous engagement to the next : " By my third birthday , I had logged 150,000 miles , occasion for an AP wirephoto captioned : ' She Sees America . ' " She also witnessed an endless string of saloons and her parents ' behavior in them : " Pat was a two-fisted drinker . Cy was a drunk , charming and good-humored when sober , combative and cold-eyed when drunk . " Liquor fueled fights between them , as did their constant lack of money . They also , Cyra recognized later , baited each other with flagrant infidelities : " Pat and Cy competed in sexual conquest as they competed in everything else . "
