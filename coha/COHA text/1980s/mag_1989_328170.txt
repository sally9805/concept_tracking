When Frans Swarttouw took over the sleepy Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker a decade ago , he predicted the little company would survive only " if it dares to start digging in the front garden of the American airplane manufacturers . " Never has the garden been greener than now . With U.S. airlines expanding their fleets and replacing aging jets , the two major American aircraft makers , Boeing and McDonnell Douglas , have enough orders to keep them busy through the early 1990s . <P> The backlog has created a perfect opening for Fokker , which started producing the compact Fokker 100 jetliner in 1987 . The company scored a major coup last week when American Airlines announced plans to buy 75 Fokker 100s , to be delivered in the next six years , and an option to purchase 75 more later on . The American deal , worth as much as $3 billion , is the largest foreign contract ever won by a Dutch company . <P> The cost of developing the new F-100 almost throttled Fokker , which the Dutch government had to bail out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new F-100 , designed to carry about 100 passengers on trips of 1,000 miles or less , is as technologically advanced as the offerings of Fokker 's larger rivals . Powered by Rolls-Royce engines , the plane is highly fuel efficient and quiet . In test flights in February , the F-100 performed well within the toughest airport-noise restrictions . <P> The jet is likely to become a familiar sight on U.S. runways . Fokker is negotiating with United Airlines for the sale of as many as 200 planes , and with Delta for 100 . Says Fokker 's Swarttouw , 56 , who plans to retire soon : " We have secured a future for Fokker of 15 to 20 years . "
