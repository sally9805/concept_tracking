It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people the world over have the newly diagnosed form of hepatitis and that perhaps 200 million more are at high risk either because they have hepatitis B or are latent , but otherwise healthy , carriers of it . However , precise figures are not known. // Delta virus has been detected in all areas of the United States , according to surveys by the Red Cross and Abbott Laboratories. // As many as 800 , 000 people in the United States are carriers of hepatitis B virus and thus vulnerable to delta infection , according to Dr. Stephen C. Hadler , an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta , who participated in the investigation of the Venezuelan outbreak. // Doctors have diagnosed several delta hepatitis cases in Los Angeles . Since last September seven cases have been reported in an ongoing outbreak among drug users in Worcester , Mass . But no cases have been reported to the New York City health department. // The discovery that delta hepatitis results from the interaction of two viruses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might be at the root of other diseases for which infectious causes have long been sought. // Delta hepatitis results from a virus that can not cause infection by itself . But when it piggybacks with another virus - the one that causes hepatitis B - the two viruses can cause an illness more severe than that caused by hepatitis B virus alone . And hepatitis B infection can be severe . Further , delta hepatitis can often become chronic and lead to cirrhosis , another incurable liver disease . Severe outbreaks can occur anywhere hepatitis B is common , the American and Venezuelan doctors warn in the Annals of Internal Medicine , reporting on the team ' s investigation of an epidemic that killed 34 of 149 , or almost 25 percent , of infected Yucpa Indians near Maracaibo . The epidemic left 22 Indians with chronic hepatitis. // The World Health Organization in Geneva expressed concern earlier this month about a need to learn more about which population groups are at highest risk of contracting delta hepatitis , more about how it is spread and what the long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be spread by contaminated blood leading to infections among drug addicts and hemophiliacs . But it is not clear whether the disease is spread in other ways and , if so , how. // Hepatitis , a word that doctors use to describe an inflammation of the liver , can be caused by many infectious agents . The hepatitis A , hepatitis B and hepatitis non- A-non-B viruses are the chief ones in the United States , though the ailment can be caused by such other microorganisms as the Epstein-Barr , cytomegalovirus and yellow fever viruses and the leptospirosis bacterium. // Alcohol is one of many chemicals that can cause hepatitis. // The discovery of the delta virus does not mean a new treatment is imminent for delta hepatitis . Doctors are at present powerless to prevent or treat delta infections. // Moreover , little can be done now to prevent delta hepatitis among those who have already been infected with hepatitis B , or recovered from its symptoms but then became carriers of the virus . Nor can much be done for those who have become silent carriers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , efforts are under way to identify components of the delta virus that induce immunity in the body and then to develop a vaccine against delta . Researchers do not know how soon one can be produced. // However , experts do believe that delta hepatitis could be avoided by widespread use of a marketed vaccine that prevents hepatitis B , one of the most common infections in the world . But the vaccine works only for people who have not developed hepatitis B. Also , although newer , synthetic vaccines are on the horizon , the existing one can not be afforded in many of the countries where hepatitis B is most prevalent. // The delta virus itself , now called a defective virus because it can not act alone , was discovered in 1977 by Dr. Mario Rizzetto in Turin , Italy . It is one of the smallest viruses known , not much larger than the viroids that cause disease in plants. // The discovery came through astute observations he made in a study of the livers of individuals whose blood tests showed they had hepatitis B infection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its core , and at the time doctors were trying to determine more precisely how they correlated with active infection. // <> <> Improving the Diagnosis // Dr. Rizzetto said in an interview that he had used a fluorescent test to identify the antigens present in the liver and a different test to detect antigens in the blood . By correlating the results he hoped to help improve the accuracy of the diagnosis of hepatitis. // Instead , he noted discrepancies in the matches and concluded that he had found a new antigen system . The discovery did not attract immediate attention. // " We were confused because we didn ' t know how to interpret the finding " except to say that the antigen was somehow linked with hepatitis B , Dr. Rizzetto said . " We could go no further in human studies. " // In 1978 Dr. Rizzetto moved to the United States . He brought along his samples to pursue further research with Dr. John L. Gerin at Georgetown University in Washington and with Dr. Robert H. Purcell at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delta antigen , an important development in itself but one that proved crucial to the next steps in the research . Until then , all Dr. Rizzetto ' s team could do was use the fluorescent test on biopsies of the liver . Now , using the delta antigen , they could develop diagnostic blood tests and use them as well as liver biopsies to follow what happened to chimps injected with specimens obtained from a patient with delta infection. // <> <> ' The Crucial Experiment ' // From these animal studies , the researchers reported in 1980 that the delta antigen was actually a virus that would produce disease in animals only under specific conditions . Specifically , the delta virus caused illness only in the chimpanzees infected with hepatitis B. " This was the crucial experiment , and everything else then followed , " Dr. Rizzetto said. // The researchers hypothesized that the delta antigen was a defective virus , one that could only replicate in the presence of hepatitis B virus . The researchers continued collaborating when Dr. Rizzetto returned to Italy . Dr. Gerin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s team , pursued research characterizing the molecular biology of the virus and its epidemiological and clinical features based on samples sent by colleagues around the world. // Soon the researchers noted an unusually high incidence of delta infection in southern Italy , a finding that , though puzzling , did not spark much immediate interest among public health officials . As Dr. James E. Maynard , chief hepatitis epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control , put it : " Until recently we didn ' t know quite what to make of it - whether it was just a bizarre disease in southern Italy or what it meant from a global perspective. " // <> <> Clues From Other Nations // Clues to the significance of delta infection have emerged from several studies throughout the world . A dramatic one came from a team headed by Dr. Bengt G. Hansson in Malmo , Sweden . His team documented the introduction of the delta agent into the Swedish drug addict community in 1973 and then showed how it steadily infected more addicts to the point where it now has reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the epidemic among Venezuelan Indians that has drawn the attention of public health experts , because it was so devastating and was the first outbreak in a general population. // " The delta virus causes a lot of disease , but how much disease we don ' t know yet , " said Dr. Gerin , the Georgetown virologist who is a leading expert in the subject. // It has become clear that delta infection occurs throughout the world . Infections have been reported from Colombia , the Amazon basin in Brazil , and other areas in northern South America . Evidence of it also has been found in Eastern Europe , the Soviet Union , the Middle East , sub-Saharan Africa , and most recently in Western Samoa and Nauru and Nuie islands in the South Pacific. // Scientists who have been trying to fill in the delta map have noted " some quirks , " said Dr. Purcell , the National Institutes of Health researcher . One quirk is that delta appears relatively rare in Asia , where hepatitis B is so prevalent. // " How did delta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there also is a lot of hepatitis B ? " Dr. Hadler of the Federal Centers for Disease Control asked . <> <> An Old Disease Newly Detected // All available evidence indicates that delta hepatitis is a newly recognized disease that has been around for a long time . It was present in the United States during World War II , according to recent tests performed by Dr. Antonio Ponzetto at Georgetown on samples of gamma globulin saved for about 40 years . Gamma globulin , which is used to provide temporary protection against some infections , is derived from blood donated by thousands of people. // Severe hepatitis has long been diagnosed in the Amazon basin of Brazil and in the Santa Marta region of Colombia . Much of that hepatitis is now believed to be caused by the delta virus , according to research done by Dr. Karin Ljunggren and other researchers at Georgetown and the National Institutes of Health. // Discovery of the delta virus has also provided doctors with a new perspective on a condition usually called chronic active hepatitis and one they have long diagnosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sudden relapses , a phenomenom that has puzzled doctors. // Now , it appears that some such relapses are due to infection with the delta agent , and studies are under way to gain more precise statistics . <> <> A Problem of Blood Tests // Undoubtedly , many cases of delta hepatitis have gone undiagnosed in the United States and elsewhere because a blood test has not been generally available beyond the ones devised by a few researchers for their own use . Abbott Laboratories now distributes a delta test but only to researchers doing epidemiologic and clinical studies . However , Cheryl Staruck , an official of the drug company in North Chicago , Ill. , said Abbott expects to market a diagnostic delta test that would be available to all physicians by the fall of 1985. // Although delta and hepatitis B viruses must link to produce delta infection , researchers said they are not certain that each of the two infections is spread in exactly the same way . One possible reason , Dr. Purcell said , is that the delta agent may be more fragile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcity of delta infection among homosexuals , a group in which hepatitis B is very common . Dr. Cladd E. Stevens of the New York Blood Center said Dr. Ponzetto at Georgetown has tested samples from the New York homosexual community for the delta agent but has not found any cases. // Scientists are now looking to the woodchuck to solve some of the mysteries of delta hepatitis , since they found that they could experimentally infect woodchucks that were infected with a virus closely related to human hepatitis B virus. // Further experiments with those animals will be part of the research needed in the future to learn more about the molecular virology of the delta agent , to know how it depends on the helper virus and the mechanism by which it works. //
