Amoco Corp. is holding talks with officials in Moscow about forming a joint venture to explore for oil and natural gas in the Soviet Union , Amoco Chairman Richard Morrow disclosed Monday . No foreign company has been allowed to look for oil in the Soviet Union . Thus , Amoco could be the first . The Chicago-based company is the biggest leaseholder in offshore China , where virtually every major U.S. oil company has operations , and other American firms , including Occidental Petroleum Corp. , have signed business pacts with the Soviets . The only oil company with a jump on Amoco appears to be Chevron Corp. , which is in a U.S. consortium that is said by participants to have a comprehensive joint-venture pact with the Soviets all but wrapped up . Chevron said the Soviets have presented the San Francisco-based company with five prospects for joint exploration ventures . But Chevron officials said Monday that the company is not ready to commit to a deal . Morrow said Amoco ' s initial contact with the Soviet Union was made around Labor Day , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at " a technical level continue , " he said . " Nothing is imminent . " Morrow , chairman of the American Petroleum Institute , was in New York for the industry association ' s annual convention . The Soviet Union is the world ' s largest oil producer , and its output is inching higher . According to U.S. government estimates , the Soviets pumped an average of 11. 8 million barrels a day this year , up from 11. 2 million barrels a day in 1985 . About 17. 5 percent of Soviet production is exported . By comparison , the United States , the world ' s second-biggest producer , pumps about 9. 8 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids a day , all of which is consumed internally . However , the Central Intelligence Agency predicts that Soviet production will taper off soon because of the old age of many of its oil fields . Most oil industry analysts say , though , that a decline could be averted through the technology and know-how of Western firms , and Amoco may be particularly well-suited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader in enhanced oil recovery , processes such as steam injection by which more liquid can be squeezed from a dwindling field . Amoco also has one of the best finding records among the major companies and has years of experience in western Canada , where conditions approach those of the Soviet oil provinces . That could prove to be important . The age and scope of Soviet oil production notwithstanding , vast areas of the nation are believed to be unexplored , especially in Siberia and the Arctic . Few U.S. firms have entered into joint ventures with the Soviets , but judging by the the deals consummated , the oil industry ranks at the top of Soviet priorities . The first partnership , concluded a year ago , was with Combustion Engineering Inc . The Stamford , Conn. - based firm is producing instruments and control equipment for Soviet refineries . Combustion Engineering said a second combine is being negotiated , in which the company would build two refineries in Siberia . In addition , Occidental Petroleum of Los Angeles said it expects to complete a multibillion-dollar petrochemical plant next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has lost to a Japanese group on constructing a second facility . The U.S. consortium that includes Chevron is believed to be close to signing an agreement with the Soviets that would make it easier for foreign firms to take profits out of the country in hard currency . In addition to Chevron , the companies are Archer-Daniels-Midland Co . , Ford Motor Co . , RJR Nabisco Inc . , Eastman Kodak Co. and Johnson &; Johnson . Until now , the Soviets ' foreign partners have been required to repatriate profits by accepting Soviet goods . This has soured some deals , such as one Monsanto Co. had been pursuing until recently . But the setup may not be a problem for a companies such as Chevron or Amoco , which can use oil as cash . Also to lure foreign investors , the Soviet government announced last month that it would amend its law on joint ventures to allow foreign companies to own more than 49 percent of the joint projects .
