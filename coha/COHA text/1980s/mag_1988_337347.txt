As representatives of the Sandinistas and the contras verbally assaulted each other in San Jose last week , the Costa Rican capital was also the site of a landmark case being tried by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights . On trial is the government of Honduras , which has been charged with " integral responsibility " in the disappearance and presumed murder of an unspecified number of its citizens by army death squads . Though the evidence presented at the proceedings deals specifically with the disappearance of four people in the early 1980s , no individuals are on trial ; rather , the court is attempting to determine if there is a pattern of murderous conduct on the part of Honduras . For many Latin Americans , the missing four may come to symbolize the thousands who have mysteriously and tragically vanished throughout the hemisphere over the years . <P> As the judicial arm of the Organization of American States , the court has until now given only advisory opinions . While the trial deals solely with Honduras , the ruling is expected to be cited as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model of international law . Compared with the record of abuses in such countries as El Salvador and Paraguay , the number of disappearances in Honduras is relatively small . But the histories of the four who vanished there satisfied the OAS 's requirements for hearing such cases , including that the petitioners must have exhausted all other avenues of recourse . Moreover , Honduras is one of the few countries that accept the court 's jurisdiction . Last week Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo pledged to accept whatever verdict the court reaches . <P> The case is a lawyer 's nightmare . Since the bodies of death-squad victims are seldom found , little prima facie evidence exists . The court has thus had to rely on the testimony of those who have brushed up against the death squads . Their willingness to cooperate has already produced tragic results . A human-rights official and a former Honduran army sergeant have been killed in the past three weeks . Many Hondurans believe they were silenced by death squads . <P> The court 's seven magistrates are not expected to reach a verdict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can issue a condemnation and order the government to pay reparations . " This case has the potential to depoliticize human rights , " says Claudio Grossman , one of the lawyers involved in the prosecution . " Instead of making human rights a point of ideological discourse , it can be adjudicated . "
