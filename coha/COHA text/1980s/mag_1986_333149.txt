Helmut Schmidt served West Germany as both Finance and Defense Minister and , from 1974 to 1982 , as Chancellor . Supercompetent , superconfident and supercritical , Schmidt is a gifted orator whose acerbic wit earned him the nickname " Schmidt the Lip . " <P> The U.S. has been a frequent target of Schmidt 's sharp tongue . He once described Jimmy Carter as a " faith healer " who made " policy from the pulpit . " Schmidt resented economic lectures from American officials . " Not only is your inflation higher than ours , " he would snap , " your unemployment rate is twice as high .
