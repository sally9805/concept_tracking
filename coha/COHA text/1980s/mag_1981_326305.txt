To the Editors : <P> <P> Your article " The Curse of Violent Crime " March 23 is a blueprint for hard decisions by officials and citizens . <P> Ordinary people have lost faith and patience in the criminal justice process . <P> Victims have moved from fear to hate . <P> Unreconstructed criminals have started to rehabilitate society in their image on release . As for setting up more task forces - humbug ! <P> <P> R. Joseph Novogrod , Director <P> Criminal Justice Department <P> Long Island University <P> New York City <P> The solution to violent crime is to sentence those convicted of murder to death . If the penalty is carried out within two weeks , it will create more space in penitentiaries and serve notice to all : You reap what you sow ! <P> <P> Philip N. Thompson Edgerton , Minn . <P> <P> If we can reform our criminal justice system and get control of violent crime without becoming too severe , then let 's do so . But if all our reforms prove futile , then we will have to resort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperation will eventually have to sacrifice their rights and liberties for the safety and security of an authoritarian state . <P> <P> Bruce F.

Life in jail is dominated by the law of the jungle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets . To these criminals , work-hard physical labor-is not glamorous or normal . This is what they need to be doing for the benefit of the communities they have victimized . <P> <P> E. Winslow Chapman <P> Director of Police <P> Memphis <P> The ridiculous debate over whether weapons or people should be controlled might end if the registration of handguns and the licensing of handgun owners were combined with long jail sentences for criminals who misuse firearms . I do not share the fear of law-abiding gun owners that they will be stripped of their arms . We register cars and license drivers , and there is n't any shortage of vehicles on the street . <P> I am one moderate Republican who will join any conservative , liberal , Democrat , G.O.P.er , populist , libertarian or mugwump willing to stop the carnage . <P> <P> Bill Green , Representative <P> 18th District , New York <P> Washington , D.C. <P> <P> My own experience with violent crime occurred just recently when I was robbed at gunpoint in front of my home .
