Italian authorities declare that Agca had " accomplices " <P> The shots rang across St. Peter 's Square last May , one witness recalled , like " the popping of a string of firecrackers . " Pope John Paul II lay grievously wounded , and a right-wing Turkish fanatic , Mehmet Ali Agca , 23 , barely escaped being torn to pieces by an angry mob for attempting to kill the Pope . Ever since , Agca has claimed that he acted alone . But right from the start , Italian police and the judges who sentenced him to life imprisonment felt to the contrary , yet were strangely reluctant to pursue their leads . Last week Italian investigators finally declared that they had concrete evidence of there being " accomplices of Agca 's in St. Peter 's Square at the time of the shooting . " <P> Incredibly , that announcement was based on photographs that the Italians had had for seven months . The pictures were taken by Lowell Newton , an American who had witnessed the assassination attempt . Newton 's photos were passed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no reaction . Then , in December , the Italians suddenly called Newton to Rome . He made the trip last week to testify about what he had seen . <P> After the shots , Newton recalls , " I saw this man running toward me . I looked down and saw a gun in his right hand and froze . " The man , says Newton , had " longish black hair and what I could only describe as Mediterranean features : dark skin , suntanned , but not black . " The man passed within four feet of Newton , who ran in pursuit , taking two photographs from behind before the fugitive disappeared into the columned archways surrounding the square . <P> Subsequently , Newton decided that the man could have been Ali Chafic , one of the team of alleged Libyan hitmen believed to be planning to kill President Ronald Reagan or other high American officials . Newton made that identification after studying a drawing of Chafic circulated by the U.S. Government . <P> Italian authorities had no comment to make on Newton 's thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony about the gunman he saw the day the Pope was shot that they declared that his evidence was " not only very important but of ultimate importance in our investigation . " <P> Newton 's mystery man may be the key to the authorities ' investigation , but the Italians have long had far more conclusive evidence that there was indeed a conspiracy to kill the Pope . A picture taken by the official Vatican photographer at the instant of the tragedy clearly shows another Turk at Agca 's elbow . Turkish authorities have identified the man as Omar Ay , a member of the neofascist National Action Party ( N.A.P. ) , the group that aided Agca to escape from a Turkish jail and start on his trip to Rome . A warrant for Ay 's arrest is outstanding in Ankara .
