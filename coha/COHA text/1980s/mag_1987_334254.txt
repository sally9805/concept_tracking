With his bushy eyebrows , courtly manners and singsong Texas drawl , Jim Wright comes across as a curious mix : part kindly uncle , part snake-oil salesman . It was the second ingredient that gave some Democrats pause about the new House Speaker 's delivering the party 's response to Ronald Reagan 's State of the Union address . But Wright was eager for his moment in the limelight , and the result was a pleasant surprise for most of his colleagues . In many ways , the speech by the 17-term House veteran proved more effective than the slickly produced Democratic responses of past years that featured blow-dried young Senators and Congressmen . <P> A year ago , certain that he would be elected to succeed Tip O'Neill as Speaker , Wright met with network officials , who agreed that a live response would be more newsworthy than a pretaped show . Although it was the turn of House Democrats to give the response , Wright decided that inviting Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd to join him would show that Democrats in both chambers are determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capitol Hill . Twice last month the two met in Byrd 's ornate office to outline what they would say . Each leader drafted his own speech on yellow legal pads , consulting colleagues and party stalwarts like Clark Clifford and Robert Strauss for suggestions . <P> Tuesday night , Wright dined with his wife Betty in a House restaurant , went to the chamber for the President 's address , then rushed to his office to start speaking live just four minutes after Reagan finished . He opened with a historical reference : in the English Commons dating back to the 14th century , he noted , " speakers " were those designated to speak to the King , a role that occasionally cost them their heads . It made the point that loyal opposition plays an important but sometimes thankless role in a democratic system . <P> Just before airtime , Wright inserted a phrase responding to Reagan 's exhortation " Let 's go to work . " Congress has already been at work for three weeks , Wright replied , and in that time has , over Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interstate highway system and shelter for the homeless . None of the measures were " budget busters , " said Wright , though three days later Reagan vetoed the water bill for budgetary reasons . <P> Wright scrawled , in a last-minute retort to Reagan 's stand against " protectionism , " a reference to the Democratic push for a trade bill that threatens higher tariffs as a way to tackle the nation 's trade imbalance . The Speaker insisted that the goal was reciprocity , doing unto other countries what they are doing to the U.S. The Administration 's policies , he said , are ballooning the trade deficit , putting Americans out of work and making " junk metal and scrap paper " the leading exports from the Port of New York . <P> Wright scolded the President for other policies that revealed a " gap between rhetoric and reality . " Just three months after signing a bill to fight drugs , Reagan " wants to cut that pledge in half .
