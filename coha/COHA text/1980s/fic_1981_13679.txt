( There is no setting , as such . There are set pieces and indications of two doorways : a front door , and a kitchen door . Something , perhaps a book shelf constructed of planks and bricks and stuffed with books and magazines , serves as a divider , waist-high , between the living room area and the kitchen area . Above the divider , old pots and pans hang from the ceiling . CS , there is a battered sofa . DS , a jerry-rigged desk with a very old typewriter atop it . Around the desk , covering the floor , are stacks of paper and manuscripts . Next to the desk is a giant wastebasket , filled to overflowing with wadded pieces of paper . There is a rusty old potbelly stove . Next to it , a box for firewood .

Outside , there is a falling-down barn and a yard filled with chickens and a goat . The audience does not need to see this but we must somehow make them know it 's there . In the original production , this was accomplished by rustic decor in the theatre itself , including paintings of livestock on the theatre walls . In this Act , it is the end of winter . Trees are still bare ; the wind is high . If there were a window , it would rattle . When the audience is seated , a harmonica is heard . It plays " For Me and My Gal . " The house lights remain up . The EMCEE , dressed in his best white suit , string tie and white shoes , enters . Stage lights still on pre-set .

JOSIE is still sitting there waiting impatiently . ) This piece of the play is called " My Blue Heaven . " Member that old song ? ( He begins to sing it . He is sidling away from the angry JOSIE .

Molly Williams , what 's wrong with that ? MOLLY It makes me feel like your wife ! JOSIE Well , use Smith or Brown or Gonzales . MOLLY Using Williams makes it easy to cash the checks .

MOLLY ( Calling . ) I suppose one of your cats is in heat again ! ( To herself . ) Another litter of kittens in the barn . Kittens , goats , chickens . . . . ( JOSIE returns . ) JOSIE Why could n't I get gay livestock ? MOLLY ( Returning to her typewriter . ) The cat 's a hooker , the rooster 's a chauvinist , the goat is a greedy opportunist  --  it 's no different here than it was in New York City . I had in mind a little suburban cottage  --  a picket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , refrigerator , dishwasher  --  JOSIE That 's not self-sufficiency , Molly , that 's middle-class incarceration . MOLLY ( Looking at the cracked window by her desk . ) It 's colder inside than it is out !

( She returns to stuff pages in window crack. ) p. 15 JOSIE ( Rummaging through manuscripts . ) You hated teaching school . MOLLY I never liked ninth graders . The girls are six inches taller than the boys and they walk with their heads tucked in their shoulders . The boys sit in class with their hands in their crotches . ( She sees JOSIE . ) What are you doing ? JOSIE Looking for something to start a fire with . MOLLY Do n't take my writing ! JOSIE You just did . ( MOLLY is recovering the wadded pages , ironing them out with her hand . ) MOLLY It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands JOSIE one page . ) You can have that one . ( JOSIE waits patiently as MOLLY examines each page . ) Ninth grade girls cry if you call on them in class , the boys get an erection if they bump into a desk . ( She drops all the pages on the sofa . ) GO ON , BURN MY WORDS ! WHO CARES ? JOSIE ( Picking them up . ) Do you want these or not ? p. 16 MOLLY I was already fed up to here before the school board informed me I was a dangerous influence . JOSIE May I burn these ? ( Receiving no response , she does . ) MOLLY ( Facing typewriter . ) This machine came over on the Mayflower . ( Dreamily . ) Remember my IBM Electric Correctable ? JOSIE It got ripped off by junkies . The time they took the TV and the tape deck . MOLLY I dream about my IBM .

JOSIE ( Reading . ) " We are most impressed by the quality of your writing but feel we do not wish to commit ourselves to a novel set in a perverted lifestyle . When you have material of interest to a more general audience . . . . " p. 17 MOLLY I was a Girl Scout for eleven years . I worked as a Pink Lady in the hospital . I won the D.A.R . award my senior year in high school . I give to the blood bank every year ! I have never missed voting in a primary ! I am a middle-class , community-oriented , college-educated WASP . ( By now , she has wandered to the front door , she opens it and shouts . ) How dare they call me a pervert !

JOSIE ( Finally angry . ) IT 'S ALL WE CAN AFFORD ! MOLLY AHA ! It all comes back to money , does n't it , it always comes back to money ! JOSIE MONEY IS NOT THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING ! TO GET MONEY , YOU GIVE SOME PART OF YOURSELF ! You survived the winter here , you 're not starving , you did n't get beriberi ! In another year , we 'll have this place in shape  --  I 'll build a windmill , we 'll be completely self-sufficient . ( MOLLY is deeply depressed . ) It takes time , honey . Soon , I 'll open up my junkshop . . . You know what I 've heard there 's fast money in ? ( MOLLY , sadly , looks up , while JOSIE searches through her survival magazines . ) Worms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a lot of wooden trays  --  MOLLY Worms . JOSIE They multiply very fast . You package them up and can them and you sell them to a supplier . They ship them to Orientals who use them in stews . MOLLY ( To heavens . ) WHAT DID I DO , WHAT DID I DO ? JOSIE ( Excited . ) I was also reading about how to build a methane generator . We can turn the chicken shit into gasoline . MOLLY WHY ME , GOD , WHY ME ? JOSIE I want you to be happy , Molly . MOLLY I know you do . JOSIE I 'm doing the best I can . MOLLY I know you are . JOSIE I like it here . MOLLY I 'm a middle-class WASP , accustomed to certain comforts . It 's in my blood . JOSIE Your great-grandmother lived just like this . MOLLY She crossed the prairie in a covered wagon so I would n't have to .

That fool hadda get his wife to get him down . " They talk about him like he 's a real person . MOLLY He is , he 's you . JOSIE Honey . . . . MOLLY Yes , sweetheart . JOSIE It 's a grey day , the goat is bedded down , the chickens are in their coops  --  let 's snuggle up and I 'll read to you about building the windmill . MOLLY I do n't want to hear about that windmill ! JOSIE ( Finding windmill specs in book . ) It 's really very simple . A wind driven electrical system consists , you see , of five parts . First the fan , which is rotated by the wind and drives the unit which generates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ components . . . . MOLLY ( Seizing book . ) It says : " It is a law of nature that an object which weighs 400 pounds on top of a vertical tower will come to weigh more than a ton as the structure leans toward the horizontal . " A ton . You want us to hoist a ton twenty feet in the air ! p. 20 JOSIE We 'll use ropes and tackles and pulleys . MOLLY NO WINDMILLS , JOSIE ! NO GOATS ! ( MOLLY throws book on sofa . ) JOSIE If we never make love , are we still lesbians ? MOLLY I 'm not in a very good mood . JOSIE If we do n't make love , then we 're celibates and if we 're celibates , we might as well be nuns . Why go through life being dumped on because we 're dykes when we could be nuns and get respect ? If we were nuns , we could probably get a grant to fix this place up as a spiritual retreat .

JOSIE Nine years . We 've been through a lot together . MOLLY I have a picture in my mind of who I am . I 'm this terribly intellectual , incredibly profound writer who hibernates in a wonderful study filled with tall dark library shelves and leather reading chairs and a massive oak desk littered with priceless jottings . On those rare occasions I come out of my study , I am beseiged by awed fans who thrust my latest novel toward me for my signature and by TV reporters who wave microphones in front of me and beg me to comment on the momentous matters of the world . When I have signed the autographs and spoken profoundly to the press , I shuffle absentmindedly into my private living area where there is a gleaming cherrywood dining table with a lace cloth and brass candlesticks and a crystal chandelier and a sideboard with silver platters heaped with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so pure it appears silver in the glass and I lift my glass to yours with a subtle but definitive click and we toast our years of happiness together . p. 21 JOSIE That 's all the part I play in your fantasy ? One click ? MOLLY And , after our sumptuous repast , we climb the circular staircase hand in hand and in our king-sized handcarved ebony bed , under our goosedown handstitched salmon silk comforter . . . . JOSIE Yes . . . ? MOLLY Actually , I always fade out as we enter the bedroom , like the 1950s movies . JOSIE Molly , what would make you happy ? MOLLY Money . JOSIE No , really . MOLLY Really . Money . JOSIE I want a windmill and you want a crystal chandelier . But , we have to deal with reality . And , the reality is that the wood has to be split . . . .

I suppose you 're going to use this in your column  --  big , virile Joe sweeping goat pellets off the kitchen floor . p. 22 MOLLY The farm wives will love it . JOSIE Wait ' til big , virile Joe builds a windmill . That 'll keep you in material for months . MOLLY I had another baby yesterday . In the column . A daughter . I call her Baby . I 'm basing it on the goat . JOSIE What ? MOLLY Like I based our son Arnold on your rooster . JOSIE You hate the goat . You despise Arnold . MOLLY Children add spice to the column . Readers like it . JOSIE You 're a hypocrite . MOLLY No , I 'm a liar . All writers are liars . Fiction is a lie about the truth . JOSIE ( She reenters . ) One job done .

( To JOSIE . ) You 're the one who writes the column , are n't you ? The Adventures of Molly and Joe ? MOLLY I write the column .

It was my idea , actually I thought it up  --  ( To JOSIE . ) Would you put that down , please ? ( She and MOLLY exchange a glance .

Independent , individual , courageous , hardworking . They 're modern pioneers , people to look up to . ( JOSIE is pleased about this . ) Now , I was just an editor , but the President took a look at your columns and he agreed with me . JOSIE Independent , courageous .

MILLER Now , I have the check for $75,000 right here with the contract . ( MOLLY is clearly upset by this . ) That 's standard , Mrs. Williams , half of the advance on signing , half on publication . This is just an advance , Mrs. Williams , why we could sell so many copies of The Adventures of Molly and Joe that this amount could double , triple ! ( MOLLY buries her head in her hands . ) Have you already had another offer , Mrs. Williams ? Has some other publisher come up here and beat me to this ? If you have n't already signed with them , Mrs. Williams , let me assure you that American Way is the number one Christian publisher in the world today . . . .

JOSIE Because my father said that our relationship was devious and dark and there 's nothing dark about the way I love you . DR . JOHN Almost the exact words I used in my speech yesterday .

MOLLY I am committed . ( To JOSIE . ) Do you see me going anywhere ? JOSIE You ca n't afford to go anywhere ! MOLLY But you think if I could , I would ? JOSIE Would you ? DR . JOHN Affirmation . She needs affirmation . MOLLY You think we 're still together out of necessity ? Lethargy ? Habit ? JOSIE Are we ? DR . JOHN You see , when it gets down to writing out those engraved wedding invitations , a person thinks twice . You examine your feelings carefully before you hire a parson . MOLLY I am not going to make a spectacle out of us . DR . JOHN Molly , you 've always been a champion of causes . Remember when they kicked that Chicano quarterback off the team ? You walked off the cheering squad and led a school-wide boycott of team sports ? You 've got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JOHN . ) You know what I really want to be ?

She gets bored easily and changes her mind about what she likes from month to month . She 's ambitious and scared of success , scareder of rejection , despises wealth but covets money , wo n't go to the privy at night unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick . . . . DR . JOHN These are reasons you love her ? JOSIE Some nights in bed , she gets up under my armpit , here , and says " Tell me how it 's going to be tomorrow , Josie . " DR . JOHN This is why you love her ? JOSIE Some of it . She needs me . I just do n't know if she loves me anymore . ( She concentrates on her windmill. ) p. 76 DR . JOHN Pardon me but that sounds awfully neurotic . JOSIE I also love her because she makes fun of my projects and inventions . If she did n't challenge me , I 'd never get around to doing anything . She keeps on baiting me , I 'll have the most successful junk shop in the state . On my own , all I want to do is lie around in the sun . Some people just have to have somebody to do for , you know .

JOSIE moves sofa out of way , takes flowers , holds half , gives half to MOLLY . ) Now , just say what you usually say . DR . JOHN ( Looking in his prayerbook . ) It does n't all apply . JOSIE Do n't worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOHN We really need a proper environment and I did want to invite the press . JOSIE People get married in their homes all the time . Private ceremonies . DR . JOHN We do n't have any witnesses . JOSIE It 's not legal , anyway . You said it 's the ceremony that 's important . So , do it . p. 81 DR . JOHN Really ? MOLLY It 's what she wants . DR .
