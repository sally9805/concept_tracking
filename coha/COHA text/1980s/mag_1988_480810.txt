In 399 B.C. Socrates stood trial for impiety and for corrupting the youth of Athens . The speech Socrates made to the 500-man jury , reconstructed by Plato in his Apology , is a classic text of Greek philosophy and part of the canon of Western thought . But the speech did not convince the jury of Socrates ' innocence : he was sentenced to death by poisoning . What follows is an analysis of the trial and some thoughts on how it might have gone differently ? in particular , how Socrates might have won acquittal . Cast as a dialogue , it presents the struggle to preserve free speech in a context relevant to both the ancient and the modern world , What is the most important discovery you have made about the trial of Socrates ? How easily he might have won acquittal . What 's your evidence ? To start with , the slim majority who voted for conviction . What was the vote ? The vote of the jury was 280 for conviction and 220 for acquittal . So a shift of thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have created a tie , and in Athens a tie would set free the accused . Was Socrates aware of this ? Of course . In Plato 's . Apology , he expresses his surprise at the narrowness of the verdict against him . " 1 did not expect so small a majority , " he says , " but a large one . " 1 . P. Stone was for many years the editor and publisher of I. F. Stone 's Weekly , a Washington newsletter . Now eighty , he has taught himself ancient Greek in the years of his retirement in order to write and think about the lessons of classical Athens . He published one of the first of his studies in the January 1981 issue of Harper 's Magazine under the tide " Plato 's Ideal Bedlam . " His new book , The Trial of Socrates , on the basis of which he wrote this dialogue , will be published this month by Little , Brown . Why was Socrates surprised ? Socrates clearly expected a large and decisive majority against him . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote . His lifelong teaching had been consistently hostile to Athenian democracy , . and his thought and opinions had attracted the kind of anti-democratic and pro-Spartan ' ' jet set " youth who had twice overthrown the democracy in the decade and a half before his trial . Moreover , his chief accuser , Anytos , enjoyed great prestige ? he was one of the generals who restored democracy in Athens barely four years before Socrates was indicted . If the Athenian demos , the common people or the many , had been as benighted and biased as Socrates believed them to be , his case would indeed have been hopeless . But the closely divided jury shows that his case was not hopeless ? that the jury was troubled about convicting him . Why do you think the jury was troubled ? Because free expression permeated the political and artistic life of Athens and had made it -- as Pericles boasts in Thucydides ? " the school of Hellas . " Philosophers from all over the Mediterranean world flocked to Athens to address its eager audiences . The city had neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what in truth had Socrates done ? He denied that he had ever joined in any of the aristocratic conspiracies against the government of Athens or committed any overt act against it , and no evidence was offered to the contrary . He had done his duty bravely as a citizen soldier . He was indicted for what he said and taught : it was purely a prosecution of ideas , and therefore at odds with the city 's most basic traditions . That is what must have troubled the Athenians then as it still troubles the modern reader now . Indeed , if the Athenians had not felt so strongly 60 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE / FEBRUARY about free speech they would not have waited until Socrates was seventy before taking him to court . So what conclusion do you draw from this ? If Socrates had pleaded the right to free speech , if he had offered a civil-libertarian defense , if he had appealed to the fundamental principles of Athenian democracy , I believe he could have turned that closely divided jury to his favor and won acquittal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe in free speech and he wanted to be convicted . There is evidence , of which too few are aware , that he wanted to die and set out deliberately to provoke the jury . ? So where do you begin your retrial of the case ? With the fundamental divergence between the premises of Athenian democracy and the teachings of Socrates . How do you describe them ? One might think , from reading Plato , that Socrates became unpopular because he went around exhorting his fellow citizens to virtue . Of course that is one way to lose friends in any society . But there were basic issues about which Socrates differed irreconcilably with his fellow citizens , and indeed with those of all but themost backward Greek areas like Crete and Sparta , or semi-barbarian Macedonia . Socrates was not just anti-democratic . He was anti-political in the Greek sense of the term . He did not approve of the polis , whether ruled by the many , as in the democracies , or the few , as in the oligarchies . He did not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human community as a herd . A herd requires a shepherd as its master , and the herdsman does not consult his sheep . Socrates rejected the polis altogether . He felt that the good life could only be achieved by withdrawing from it and keeping one 's soul unsullied by politics . What was the dominant Greek view ? Aristotle later summed this up best when he declared that man is a political animal , i.e. , an animal that lives in a city-state or community , koinonia . Communal life is made possible because man , unlike the other animals , has Logos ? the power of reasoned and persuasive speech . He can tell right from wrong , and therefore is able to live peacefully with his fellows with sufficient respect for the opinions and rights of others to make the community viable . Aristotle said that the solitary man is either a savage or a god . The attaining of knowledge for him , as for most Greeks , was not a metaphysical wild goose chase for unattainable absolute definitions ? for that is what Socrates was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distilled from common experience . Finally , Aristotle saw the city as the place where men could best achieve the good life , each fulfilling his individual capacities , whether as a tragic poet or a humble craftsman , or , yes , as an endless and eternally charming talker like Socrates . Socrates would have died frustrated and unfulfilled without the ever-curious listeners and ready interlocutors Athens afforded him . Imagine ! In Plato 's dialogue the Gorgias , we find Socrates ? who made loquacity his life 's mission ? accusing Pericles of having made the Athenians talkative ! Are you expressing the views of Socrates , or Plato 's view of Socrates ' views ? These are views attributed to Socrates in Xenophon as well as Plato ; both were disciples of Socrates , and together they provide us with the fullest contemporary view of him . This is also the opinion of other followers of Socrates . His followers varied widely , as St. Augustine notes , in their philosophical views . But politically all Socratics rejected the polis , as Socrates himself did . Who did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only rational , ruler for Socrates , as expressed by him in Xenophon 's Memorabilia , was " the man who knows . " This was , of course , the germ that Plato developed into the idea of rule by a philosopher-king . Did Socrates ever think of running for public office as " the man who knows " ? The Delphic oracle , as Socrates boasted , said that no one was wiser than he . But Socrates spent his life demonstrating that he knew only that he did n't know , which put him one rung above all other Athenians , none of whom could meet his standard for real knowledge . So that left the city up a creek with no qualified candidate ? Exactly . So Socrates had nothing but contempt for the city-state ? Well , he did have a curious infatuation with Sparta , the great rival and enemy of Athens . Why do you call it curious ! Because Sparta had no use for a Socrates . It was suspicious of foreigners and foreign ideas . It was a dour military state where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant military training . They were a minority holding down their human herd of serfs , the helots , who cultivated their fields . Traders and craftsmen , members of the middle class ? which in Athens was the most dynamic element in society ? led a stunted and barely tolerated existence on thefringes of Spartan life , and were denied the rights of citizenship . Sparta was devoid of philosophers and artists . It never had a Parthenon or a theater . It had one or two poets , but these were famous mostly for war songs . Sparta and Crete were the cultural deserts of ancient Greece . Yet we know from Plato 's Crito that Socrates admired these tight little militaristic oligarchies . Just why is never explained . Did such crotchety views bother the Athenians ? Yes , because the idealization of Sparta was characteristic of the young , wealthy , disaffected aristocrats who hated democracy and were both contemptuous and envious of the " pushy " traders and craftsmen who were achieving wealth and contesting the political primacy of the old landed gentry . Socrates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , became the idol of the disdainful and alienated young aristocrats in Athens , Plato and Xenophon among them . How do we know this ? From our earliest contemporary glimpse of Socratic politics : the Birds of Aristophanes . In a joyous spoof of his fellow Athenians , the comic poet ridiculed these privileged young malcontents for imitating Spartan manners , wearing their hair long and unkempt , going around unwashed , wearing short cloaks and carrying little cudgels as Spartans did . Aristophanes even coined a Greek word for them . He called them esokritoun " Socratified . " Did that get Socrates into trouble ? For a long time no one took these young men seriously ; their infatuation with Sparta and Socrates was a joke . But then the joke suddenly went sour . What do you mean ? The joke became what we would call , in Justice Holmes 's famous phrase , a " clear and present danger . " In the last decade and a half of the life of Socrates , these young aristocrats ? in the wake of Athenian military defeats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the democracy and became the bully boys , the hit squads and storm troopers of rapacious dictatorships . Life , liberty , and property were never as insecure in Athens as under these two anti-democratic regimes . The first overthrow was in 411 B.C. The second , in 404 B.C. , was led by Critias and Charmides , relatives of Plato and former students of Socrates . They appear as honored figures in the Platonic dialogues . This rebellious fringe of Athenian society made a third but unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the democracy again in 402 B.C. , just three years before the trial of Socrates . These three events shattered the confidence of the Athenians and made them less tolerant . But for this , Socrates would never have been brought to trial . 62 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE i FEBRUARY Are there trustworthy sources for all this ? The terror imposed on Athens by the rule of the so-called Four Hundred in 411 B.C. is told by Thucydides with his Olympian objectivity . The horrors of The Thirty in 404 B.C. are related with equal objectivity by Xenophon ( though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confirmed by Aristotle in his work on the Constitution of Athens . Xenophon 's history , the Hellenica , is also our source for the renewed threat to democracy in 402 B.C. These events are all part of the story that Plato does not tell . What did Socrates do during the reign of The Thirty ? There was a struggle against The Thirty , and Socrates might have made himself a hero of the resistance if he had spoken against their rule or fled the city to join the opposition . Instead he stood above the battle , neither supporting nor opposing the dictators . But did n't Xenophon in his Memorabilia ? or Memoirs of Socrates ? picture Socrates as at odds with Critics and The Thirty ? True , but that opposition was minimal and private . Socrates refused to take part in the arrest of the wealthy resident alien , Leon of Salamis . Leon was only one of many such metics of his class whom the dictators executed without trial in order to seize their property ; The Thirty used Leon 's property to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Athens and kept them in power . Was n't that praiseworthy as civil disobedience ? Indeed it was . But Socrates would have fared better at his trial ? indeed I believe he would never have been indicted ? if he had done more . If he had warned Leon of the danger , if he had made a public protest , if he ? the lifelong reacher of virtue ? had denounced these immoral and illegal acts , and especially if he had left the city to join the opposition . But throughout the conflict , he stayed in the city . Why do you emphasize the phrase " stayed in the city " ? Under the amnesty that followed the restoration of democracy , no one except the oligarchic rulers could he prosecuted for anything they had done or failed to do before and during the dictatorship . But we know from legal pleadings in the following generation that to have " stayed in the city " during the conflict was regarded as shameful and could be used to prejudice the jury . ? You mentioned earlier that Socrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where is the proof of this ? The evidence is in Xenophon 's Apology . Unlike Plato 's Apology , Xenophon 's is not a masterpiece and is therefore little read . It is sketchyand seems to have been written soon after the trial . But Xenophon 's plain and hasty account tells us things that Plato prefers to veil . What does Xenophon add to the story ? Xenophon says that everybody who wrote about the trial was surprised at the tone Socrates took in his own defense and felt that it could only serve to provoke a conviction . Does Xenophon agree ? He agrees that the way Socrates handled his defense was hardly calculated to obtain an acquittal . But he says this should not have occasioned surprise because Socrates wanted to die . That 's not the impression from reading Xenophon 's Apology in translation . That 's because the reverence for Socrates is such that most English versions of Xenophon 's Apology have mistranslated a key word in the Greek text and confused the reader . What word is that ? The word is rnegalegoria and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page . Let us take the Loeb bilingual edition as our example . There ? I suppose for euphony ? we find three different renderings of this one word : ( 1 ) " the loftiness of his words , " ( 2 ) " his lofty utterance , " and ( 3 ) " the sublimity of his speech . " What 's wrong with that ? A sharp-eyed reader , even without the Greek text , will sense that something is wrong with these translations because Xenophon argues that " this was appropriate to the resolve he had made . " The resolve was that Socrates had decided it was better to die than to be acquitted , since at seventy he believed that old age and its ailments would soon overtake him . Is n't that quite plausible ? Indeed it is , and it also fits with Socrates ' attitude as described by Plato . But what is implausible is this : If he wanted to die , why would he speak with loftiness or sublimity ? Athenian juries were notoriously susceptible to elevated rhetoric and beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its forms . To speak that way to the jurists would not have antagonized them . It would have swayed the jury to acquit . Socrates himself observes in Xenophon 's account how often Athenian juries " have been carried away by an eloquent speech . " So if megalegoria meant eloquence , it was hardly suited to what Xenophon says was Socrates ' purpose . So how do you solve that puzzle ? By taking a fresh look at the original text and the Greek language . And we find something fascinating : megategoria did mean sublimity of expression at one time . But that meaning developed many centuries after the trial of Socrates , in writings on Greek rhetoric under the Roman Empire . At the rime of the trial , megalegorialiterally " big talking " ? meant boastfulness and arrogance of expression . This meaning is attested to by its usage in other works by Xenophon and those of other writers of the time . So you see , Xenophon is saying that Socrates was being arrogant and boastful . And that was well calculated to achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does Plato 's account rebut Xenophon 's ? On the contrary , if you reread the Apology , the Crito , and the Phaedo after reading Xenophon , you will see that Plato 's version , though more subtle , dovetails with Xenophon 's . Give us an example . What most antagonized the jury , as reported in both Plato and Xenophon , was Socrates ' claim that the oracle at Delphi had termed him the wisest of men , as Xenophon puts it , or as Plato more enigmatically treats it , that no one was wiser than Socrates . In his Apology , Plato says that there was a thorubos , an angry outcry from the jury , when Socrates said this . Socrates felt it necessary to deny that he was boasting . In that denial , Socrates uses the Greek expression mega lege in ? big talk or boasting . That is an exact synonym for the megalegoria in Xenophon . Is there evidence elsewhere in Plato to support Xenophon ? Yes . In the Cruo , after the trial , Socrates ' disciples complain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even suggest that he seems to have been bent on a kind of suicide . How does Socrates answer that charge ? By an implicit admission . Socrates responds with a lovely but essentially nonsensical mystical discourse in which he argues that the philosopher should seek death as fulfillment because only in death is the soul freed from the body and able at last to contemplate the eternal and unchangeable Ideas . The Phaedo becomes a paean to death . It is a beautiful dialogue . But it certainly does not deny that in a sense Socrates gave himself the hemlock . But are you not skipping ahead in the trial ? True . An Athenian trial had two phases . First the jury had to vote on whether to convict or not , and then on the penalty . Under Athenian procedure , the prosecution proposed one penalty and the defense another . The jury could not " split the difference " : it had to vote one or the other . The prosecution proposed the death penalty . Then Socrates went on to antagonize the jury again by proposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relying now on Xenophon 's account or Plato 's ? Plato 's is the fuller . He tells us how , in this concluding part of the trial , Socrates provoked the jury by a suggestion it was bound to consider offensive . What was that ? In Athens , civic heroes and other distinguished persons were honored with free meals at the city hall . Socrates suggested that as his penalty he be given free meals there for the rest of his life . When this created an uproar of disapproval , he proposed a trivial fine . Only at last and too late , after appeals from Plato and other disciples that they were ready to put up the money , did he offer to pay a substantial fine . But by then the jury was too furious : it voted for the death penalty . It is worth knowing that the vote for the death penalty was much larger than the original vote for conviction . Many who had been ready to acquit now voted for death . Megalegoria had achieved its purpose . How do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have advised if you had been his lawyer ? Actually Athens did not have lawyers in our sense . Litigants could hire speechwriters ; Demosthenes was the most famous of them . Socrates did n't need one . He was the cleverest arguer in town and quite capable of a successful defense if he had wanted one . Still , how would you have liked Socrates to handle his case ? I believe Socrates was unjustly accused , that no overt acts against the city were even alleged much less proven , that this was purely a prosecution for opinion ? for what he had said and taught in the last few years of his life . As such it violated the city 's most precious principles . Free speech was the very basis of its democracy , of the debates in the assembly where the laws were made , and in the jury courts in which those laws were interpreted . Free speech made possible the masterpieces , tragic and comic , of the Athenian theater ? still among the wonders of world literature . I think that Socrates could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had argued a free-speech defense . ? But what makes you think that Athenians were conscious of free speech as a basic principle of government ? If a society is conscious of an idea , it will have a word for it . The Romans had no free speech in our sense and they had no word for it . But I found that the ancient Greeks had no less than four terms for free speech . That is more than in any other language . What were those four words ? The oldest , first encountered in Aeschylus , is compounded from the words for free , eleutheros , and mouth , stomas . The second turns up first in Herodotus , who made his history a prose epic in celebration of democracy , an account of the struggle of Greek democracy ? especially Athenian ? against Persian despotism . That word is isegon'a , which etymologically means an equal right to speak in the assembly . It thus became a synonym for political equality . What were the other two ? The next was parrhasia , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earliest appearance , as far as we can tell , is in the plays of Euripides . It referred to both that frankness on which the Athenians prided themselves and their right to free speech as citizens of a free city . It was a flag-waver of a word for Athenian audiences . Milton used a passage from Euripides at the very beginning of his Areopagitica , the noblest defense of a free press in modern times . How effectively Socrates might have used lines from Euripides to sway his jury for acquittal ! And what was the fourth ? Isologia , which means an equal right to speak . It appears in the history written by Polybius and has a special meaning for Americans . Polybius was the historian of the Achaean League , the first successful federal government in history , and the Framers of our Constitution looked to Polybius for inspiration in establishing our own federal system . Polybius , attributes the stability and survival of this Greek federation ? long after Greek freedom had been crushed elsewhere by Macedonian and Roman armies to the fact that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member cities and in their federal assembly or congress . So how , specifically , if Socrates had wanted an acquittal , should he have argued his case ? If I had been his speechwriter , I would have had him say this : " Men of Athens , fellow citizens , this is not a trial of Socrates but of ideas , and therefore of Athens . You are not prosecuting me for any unlawful or impious act against our city or its altars . No such evidence has been brought against me . " You are not prosecuting me for anything I did , but for what I have said and taught . You are threatening me with death because you do not like my views and my teaching . This is a prosecution of ideas and that is something new in our city 's history . In this sense , Athens is in the dock , not Socrates . Each of you , as my judges , is a defendant . " Let me be frank . I do not believe in your so-called freedom of speech , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men are only doxabeliefs without substance , pale shadows of reality , not to be taken seriously , and likely only to lead a city astray . " I think it absurd to encourage the free utterance of unfounded or irrational opinions , or to base civic policy on a count of heads , like cabbages . Hence I do not believe in democracy . But you do . This is your test , not mine . " Your freedom of speech is based on the assumption that every man 's opinion is of value , and that the many are better guides than the few . But how can you boast of your free speech if you suppress mine ? How can you listen to the shoemaker 's or the tanner 's views when you debate justice in the assembly , but shut me up when I express mine ? " You are proud that the gates of Athens have been opened to philosophers from all over Greece and even the outer barbarian world . Will you now execute one of your own because suddenly you can not stand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you who will be disgraced forever by my condemnation . " You say my ideas have been corrupting the youth and leading them to question the democracy . You say that I was Critias 's teacher : You are acting as if you had become his pupils . " The Thirty were arbitrary , and did as they pleased . You claim to be men who litre by the law . Are you not acting like them ? Tell rue , now , by what law of.Athens do you seek to restrict philosophic teaching ? Where can I find it among the city 's statutes ? When was it debated and voted ? Who proposed such a monstrosity , as you yourselves ? in calmer days and in your right minds ? would have termed it ? " The test of truly free speech is not whether what is said or taught conforms to any rule or ruler , few or many . Even under the worst dicta . tor , it is not forbidden to agree with him . It is the freedom to disagree that constitutes freedom of speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pride of our city , the glory on which your orators dwell . Will you turn your backs on it now ? " You say 1 have shown disrespect for the city 's gods . Beware lest you make YotifSelves guilty of that very offense in condemning me . How can you honor Peitho ? our civic goddess of perstrasionwhen persuasion is inhibited , and nonconformist thoughts prosecuted ! Are you not disobeying Zeus Agoraios , the patron deity of free debate in the assembly , when you restrict debate by condemning me ? " Ideas are not as fragile as men . They can not he made to drink hemlock . My ideas ? and my example ? will survive me . But the good name of Athens will wear a stain forever if you violate its traditions by convicting me . Tfi shame will be yours , not mine . " You would have challenged them with a compliment ? Right . Had Socrates invoked freedom of speech as a basic right of all Atheriiaits ; . he would have struck a deep and responsive chord . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,
