 | The sun shines brightly as I take my front row seat for the tennis match already in progress . There 's Jimmy Connors , larger than life , no more than six feet in front of me . Some spectators sit motionless waiting for the volley . Others fan themselves vigorously in an attempt to cool the sun 's heat . Me ? I 'm comfortable . I 'm seated in a plush chair and cooled by air conditioning . My view of the game is from a projection-TV set ? actually , more than a dozen of them ? and it 's spectacular . " The projection pictures are good because the room lighting is high , " says David Hinchman , president of U.S. Precision Lens , developer of lenses for a variety of projectionTV makers . " If I dim the lights , you 'd probably like a standard direct-view TV better . " Wait . That flies in the face of experience with earlier projection TVs . With those , to see a picture the room had to be darkened ? the darker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light in Precision Lens 's main viewing room , the pictures from the projection sets I see are beautiful . What 's changed ? " Everything , " says Hinchman . " Set makers have made advances in everything from optics , electronics , and screen design down to details as basic as the type of phosphor used in cathode-ray tubes " The result is not necessarily a larger picture ? many were big to start with ? but a better picture . For example , while earlier projection sets in the 40- to 46-inch range were rated at under 200 footlamberts , the newer models are well over 300 . That 's significantly higher than conventional direct-view TVs . Picture contrast and resolution have also been improved . And judging by what I see in front of me , projection sets can now offer a more pleasing viewing experience than large direct-view models . How was all that done ? After talking to a variety of set makers , I learned that any projection TV set is really one large bundle of compromises , and the new generation of big-screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternatives now available to designers . Bright enough " The first projection sets were 15 footlamberts , " points out Henry Kloss , who is generally regarded as the father of projection TV . To see 15 footlamberts of light , you needed shades on the windows . Now , with ratings like 300 footlamberts ( compared with some 115 footlamberts from conventional direct-view TV ) , all that 's changed . Most veterans of the business concede it 's dangerous to compare the brightness ratings given by different manufacturers . Reason : There are almost as many different @# @#  | styles of rating as there are brands . But there 's general agreement that projection TVs are finally bright enough . " The early history of not being bright enough has passed , " says Kloss . The improvement is largely due to enhancements in the optical system of the sets ? the cathode-ray tube , the lenses , and the coupling between them . " To get greater brightness you have to use a larger tube to get more light , or you must drive a small tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sounds simple ? to the point where manufacturers should have accomplished that long ago ? the reality is anything but so . " There are trade-offs , " says Hinchman . For example , the seemingly easiest solution is to increase the size of the projection tube . But there are three of them ? one for each color ? so cabinet-size requirements triple . Also , larger tubes have to be set farther apart , making the angle to the screen greater . That increases the chance that the colors will not hit at precisely the same point on the screen , creating a smeared , inaccurate color picture . " The farther apart the tubes are , " says Hinchman , " the bigger the angle of projection and the greater the color shift . " For these reasons , many makers have opted to use smaller tubes running at high power levels . This decision did not come easily , however . The first thing designers discovered was that the higher currents created heat ? lots of it . The heat affected the stability of the projection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life span of the tube . RCA Consumer Electronics Business tackled that problem with an optically coupled system . Originally , the only thing between each tube and the first element of each lens was air . RCA 's optically coupled arrangement linked the tube and lens with a gel-like substance to help dissipate the heat and create an optically smooth transition from tube to lens . Because engineers used a fluid with nearly the same optical qualities as the tube and the lens , both surfaces became transparent . Result : a stable , unified optical system stretching from the tube through the lens . Newer sets use the same idea , except designers have substituted an ethylene-glycol ( antifreeze ) coolant . " It 's thirty percent more efficient in dissipating heat buildup than the old liquid , " says RCAs Elliot Broadwin . With coolants makers could safely increase the drive on a tube . But , as they discovered , it created even more problems . " There 's a threshold , " says Marc Aurbach , product manager for Mitsubishi Electric Sales America , " beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurs when a deposit builds up on the tube cathodes , gradually degrading image brightness . In the past , manufacturers limited the beam current to prevent this from happening , but Mitsubishi tried something else . " We applied scandium oxide , a rare-earth material , to the cathode section of the electron gun , " Aurbach says . " and it has completely eliminated the problem . There 's now no practical limit to brightness . " Phosphor functions While running the tube hotter produces brighter , more vivid colors , it also can eliminate some of the subtle shadings in darker objects . To solve that , Sony Corp . traded the standard white phosphor inside the tube 's face with one that contains a blue hue . The company contends that the blue phosphor allows it to use a warmer , less-bluish shade of white and pick up more subtle shading . Also , by mixing with the red , green , and blue elements of the picture , the blue phosphor corrects for the yellow tinge sometimes apparent in white objects during peak brightness Zenith Electronics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system too , but for different reasons . The company claims to have developed a more efficient phosphor that requires less power to achieve a 20-percent increase in brightness . The phosphor is applied only to the center tube , which projects the green image . Because the tubes are n't being driven as hard as before , Zenith says the new sets have more uniform whites and reduced blooming ( a halolike effect that occurs as colors wash into each other ) . Despite the fact that one tube is brighter than the other two , " You do n't see more green than the other colors , " says a Zenith spokesman . Creating a bright , clear image on the tube is one thing to projection-TV makers ; getting that image to the screen is another . For that it takes a variety of new lenses . All other factors being equal , designers will usually choose a lens with as short a focal length as possible . As focal length decreases , the field angle ? the light path to the screen ? widens . Thus a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small cabinet . But , again , it 's not that simple . " The bigger the angle , the more difficult it is to design a lens to maintain performance , " says Hinchman . As the field angle widens , light is dispersed over a greater area , and that causes a loss of brightness and sharpness , particularly around the corners of the screen . " Original projection TVs used lenses with a fairly long focal length , " says Hinchman , " about 135 millimeters . " New sets , like ones from Hitachi , Ltd. , use a 70mm lens that creates a 40-inch picture in a cabinet just over 21 inches deep . " That 's comparable with the depth of a typical direct-view set , " says Hinchman . To correct for the relative loss in picture sharpness with the shorter focal length , Hitachi engineers created a new " first lens " element by curving the phosphor on the inner surface of the tube . The faceplate , in effect , becomes a lens element that focuses its image and cuts down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a projection TV also lies in its screen . While early screens were designed primarily for gain ? a number that represents how bright a screen 's picture will ultimately be ? designers now concentrate on viewing angle and color shift . Magnavox achieved the optimum viewing angle of 180 degrees ( 90 degrees from each side of center ) accidentally , and then learned a lesson in economics . " The screen was originally developed to eliminate color shift , " says Scott Baker , projection-TV engineering section manager for North American Philips Consumer Electronics Corp . Magnavox 's parent company ) . The double-lenticular screen ( lenticular refers to the vertical ridges that cross the screen ) combines two ridged surfaces ( see drawing ) . The surface on the front diffuses ambient light . A second rear Fresnel surface refocuses the image coming off the three tubes and corrects for the color shift caused by the slight angle between them . The design worked well , even better than Magnavox expected : " The 180-degree viewing angle was a byproduct , " says Baker . But as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art created a rubber-band effect when it came time to manufacture the screens in mass quantities . " Given the shape we needed , it was just too hard to make them consistently and economically , " explains Baker . A compromise : Magnavox now uses a 160-degree double-lenticular screen that eliminates color shift . Contrast and resolution " A viewer 's perception of even a small increase in contrast is greater than the perception of a large gain in brightness , " says Mitsubishi 's Aurbach . " Contrast is the key issue now . " That 's an area where Pioneer Video has already broken new ground by zeroing in on new electronics . The company 's black-level correction system attacks a common problem in TV signal processing : While the transition from black to white should be instantaneous to produce crisp contrast , the reality is a more gradual shift that blurs the distinction between the two . Pioneer 's circuit expands the dynamic range between black and white , leading to faster , sharper transitions . Also , because the circuit improves contrast , it improves edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution . Add a high-bandwidth ( up to 10 megahertz ) video-processing system , and the Pioneer projection TV has a whopping 560-line resolution . " We have a wider bandwidth than the tubes can produce , " says Pioneer 's R. Greg Kalsow , a senior product planning manager . The same technology is available to other manufacturers . The trade-off ? Cost . Pioneer projection sets , at about $3,500 , are substantially more expensive than many others on the market . Advances in lenses , tubes , electronics , and cabinet design ultimately address the central point in projection TV : picture size . For example , Mitsubishi recently rolled out a 60-inch rear-screen system ? huge by the standards of the category ? and rumors persist that the company has a 72-inch model ready to go . And Kloss 's two-piece systems typically project an image of 6 ? feet or more for the largerthan-life experience that drew many designers to projection TV in the first place . " I rate size high , " says Kloss . " It 's the single most important consideration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another sip of wine , turn up the air conditioning , and wince as a life-size tennis racket swings my way . The picture-size race , once limited because of image quality , seems poised to start again now that many of the past problems appear to be solved . A true theater-size TV at home ? Pass the popcorn. @#
