Borrowing is up as state funds run dry <P> Even as some Administration officials cited signs that the recession may be nearing an end , new government statistics were measuring the toll the slump has taken . The Labor Department reported last week that one out of every five American workers , or 23.4 million people , were out of work during part of 1981 ; that is 2 million more than in the previous year . The Census Bureau also noted that 32 million Americans , or 14% of the population , lived below the poverty line in 1981 ( $9,287 for a family of four ) , the highest poverty rate since 1967 , when 14.2% of all Americans were officially poor . Both sets of statistics reflect the nation 's current 9.5% unemployment rate , the highest in four decades , which is now threatening a number of industrial states with a new financial crisis . <P> In the first half of this year , ten states had to borrow a total of $2.37 billion from the Federal Government in order to pay basic benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine states borrowed only $1.6 billion . These loans , coupled with unpaid balances incurred during earlier downturns , have pushed the total indebtedness for 16 states , plus Puerto Rico , the Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia , to $7.8 billion . That figure is expected to grow to $9.5 billion by year 's end , and more states are likely to join the list of loan seekers before the recovery gets under way . Moreover , strict new federal rules governing these debts threaten to keep many state unemployment funds on the edge of insolvency unless drastic steps are taken . Those steps could include the reduction of benefits for unemployed workers and income tax increases . <P> In the present system , employers pay unemployment insurance premiums into state trust funds , which provide laid-off workers with benefits that average about $118 a week ( for a single worker ) across the nation . The back-to-back recessions of the past decade , combined with persistent unemployment in many industries , have dried up the trust funds of many states , forcing them to borrow from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits . More than half of the debt due the Federal Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund , for example , is owed by four big industrial states : Illinois , with 10.6% unemployment ; Michigan , with the nation 's highest jobless rate of 14.3% ; Pennsylvania , at 9.8% joblessness ; and Ohio , where unemployment is 11.1% . Each of the first three states owes $1.6 billion , while Ohio is $1.1 billion in the red . <P> Labor Department officials argue that the states are partly to blame for their troubles , since some of the biggest borrowers pay the highest benefits . Ohio , for example , pays $233 per week to a displaced worker with four dependents , which is one of the most generous benefits in the country . By contrast , neighboring Indiana , racked by 11.4% unemployment , pays $141 for the same size family , and has never had to borrow from the federal fund .
