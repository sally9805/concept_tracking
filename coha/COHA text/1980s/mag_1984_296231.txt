Indicted in New York , Donovan takes a leave from the Cabinet <P> For a member of the President 's Cabinet , the situation could hardly have been more humiliating . Secretary of Labor Raymond Donovan walked into a forbidding concrete courthouse in New York City last week to be booked , fingerprinted and photographed like a common criminal . He looked startled when the policeman taking his mug shot remarked dryly , " I suppose I 'll see you again . " The cameraman was joking , other officers explained . " I do n't think he was , " replied the grim-faced Secretary . After going through more than two hours of processing , including a computerized check of his fingerprints against those of known fugitives , Donovan was led by detectives to a New York State Supreme Court room jammed with reporters . Arraigned before a state judge , the Secretary had some unusual company : a convicted mobster newly charged with murder , a bookie accused of being an accomplice in the killing , a Democratic state senator and seven dark-suited executives of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts last year . <P> Donovan and nine assorted co-defendants stood accused of grand larceny , as well as 125 counts of falsifying business documents and eleven counts of filing phony papers with government agencies . The purpose and end result , according to an indictment handed up by a Bronx grand jury , was to defraud the New York City Transit Authority of some $8 million on a $ 186 million subway contract awarded to New Jersey 's Schiavone Construction Co. in 1978 . At the time , Donovan was executive vice president and one of two controlling stockholders in the firm . He is the first Cabinet member ever to be indicted while still in office. * <P> The indictment was a bitter blow to Donovan , 54 , a seminary graduate who once considered becoming a priest . Instead , he went into the construction business , and became a millionaire building subways , bridges , tunnels and airports in the New York-New Jersey metropolitan area . One of the first business executives in the Northeast to come out strongly for Ronald Reagan during the 1980 Republican primaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's reward was a Cabinet post . From his earliest days in office , however , he was plagued by accusations , mostly made by gangsters , that he and his company had close ties to organized crime . <P> Investigations of Donovan by the FBI , the U.S. Attorney 's office in New York and Special Prosecutor Leon Silverman produced no indictments . Silverman , while expressing concern over the " disturbing " number of allegations against Donovan , had concluded after two separate probes that there was " insufficient credible evidence " to accuse the Secretary of having broken any federal laws .
