A message to the bureau about constitutional rights <P> In a packed federal courtroom in Washington last week , the many retired FBI agents on hand chorused an audible sigh of relief . That was when Judge William Bryant announced the sentences for two former top agents convicted on Nov. 6 for their roles in approving illegal break-ins during the Nixon Administration in the early 1970s . Found by a jury to have conspired to violate citizens ' Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures , W. Mark Felt , 67 , who had been the FBI 's deputy director , and Edward S. Miller , 52 , once its chief of domestic intelligence , could have been given ten years and $10,000 fines . But Bryant chose not to jail them . Instead he fined Felt $5,000 and Miller $3,500 . <P> The sentencing came after the Justice Department dropped the charge against a co-conspirator in the case , L.

A New York City-based FBI unit called Squad 47 broke into the homes of innocent relatives and friends of the fugitive radicals seeking clues to their whereabouts . Sometimes dressed as telephone repairmen , they would pick locks or buy keys from landlords and , once inside , photograph diaries , letters and other documents . The burglaries would be cleared in advance with Miller , who got approval from Felt . Though Squad 47 conducted at least 20 such " black-bag jobs , " the sleuthing did not turn up any Weather Underground people , although some have voluntarily surfaced in the past months . <P> Though the Justice probe of unconstitutional acts implicated 68 present or former FBI agents , more than half got immunity from prosecution in exchange for their cooperation ; cases against nine others were scrapped , and six received token administrative punishment .

They insisted that he had authorized the break-ins . To try to prove that Gray had that power , defense lawyers put five former Attorneys General and Richard Nixon on the stand . Though Judge Bryant did not explain his sentences , he may have decided that what Felt called the " serious blemish " of conviction was nearly ample punishment .
