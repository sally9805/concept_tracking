The Reds ' had their former ace throw out the ceremonial first pitch the other night , as the club saluted him on the 50th anniversary of his incredible achievement. // // Some longtime records have been surpassed in recent year ' s , such as Ty Cobb ' s hitting mark ( by Pete Rose ) and Babe Ruth ' s career home run total ( by Hank Aaron ) , but it is almost inconceivable that Vander Meer ' s record , set in his first full year in the majors , will ever be erased . Just tying it would appear an astronomical long shot given the frequency of no-hitters. // There was only one in the majors last season , and just two the year before that . Nolan Ryan had two no-hitters in 1973 , but they came two months apart . Six players have entered the ninth inning with a no-hitter this year , but then given up at least one hit. // The Dutch Master , as Vender Meer was sometimes called , crafted his first hitless performance against the Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back four days later to silence Brooklyn ' s bats in the first night game ever played at Ebbets Field. // Neither opponent was a powerhouse ( each finished in the lower half of the eight-team National League that year ) , and perhaps Vander Meer benefitted from the unfamiliar lighting conditions in the second game . Even so , what he accomplished qualifies as a wonder. // Ironically , Vander Meer , who is now 73 , has never been elected to the Hall of Fame . In this regard , he is like Roger Maris , who broke Ruth ' s single-season home run record , but whose overall career wasn ' t considered of Hall caliber ( this despite being a two-time MVP ) . Vander Meer was 15-10 in 1938 , never won more than 18 games in a season , and finished his 13-year career 119-121 . <> <> Whitewater racing ' s Olympic return // In a coup for canoe and kayak enthusiasts , a whitewater slalom event will be included along with the flat-water Olympic races at the 1992 Barcelona Games . The door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong support from within Barcelona apparently won acceptance for the idea . Whitewater events were held in the Olympics only one other time , in 1972 , when a $4 million course was built outside Munich in Augsburg. // This can be a very exciting spectator sport , particularly with man-made courses that allow close proximity to the action . The whitewater community is getting better organized each year , too , and this weekend will hold the first event of a newly formed World Cup circuit. // Wausau , Wis. , will be host to the inaugural competition , which precedes events on the Savage River in western Maryland ( which gets the world championships next year ) , the Gull River in Ontario , and in South Bend , Ind . From there it ' s on to Dublin and Nottingham , England , before the cup finals in Augsburg , Aug. 20-21 . <> <> Pro basketball impressions // Herein some random thoughts related to the current National Basketball Association Finals : // * Every year physical play seems to become an issue in the league ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tete-a-tete . It becomes a rather tiresome theme , and one which the NBA should move to squelch . Unfortunately , however , there is a tendency to let the boys get rougher in the finals and for the officials to swallow their whistles . Maybe this is because crash-bang basketball gives the appearance of being more intense and emotional . Whatever the reason , the NBA does itself a disservice by allowing the rough stuff to escalate in its showcase event. // * There is tremendous enthusiasm for the finals in the two competing cities , Los Angeles and Detroit , but is there even half as much interest elsewhere ? Possibly not . Getting and holding the public ' s attention must be difficult under the circumstances . It ' s often said the finals begin way too late , but they also may be too spread out . Obviously it ' s important to have some rest between games , but sacrificing some would give the series more compactness . As it is , if the finals go seven games , the championship gets strung out over 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on teams in the finals . Each year the guys who sit and wait seem to stand and shout more . The loquacious M.L. Carr of the Boston Celtics may have been the pace setter in this regard , especially with his towel-waving antics during the ' 84 Celtics-Lakers finals . In the current finals , L.A. guard Wes Matthews may be the most active of the reserves . He ' s such an animated and enthusiastic cheerleader it ' s a wonder the Lakers don ' t sometimes get charged with having too many men on the court . <> <> Touching other bases // * Will an exhibit of sneaker soles ever hang in an art gallery ? One wonders , after flipping through an article on new shoes in Tennis magazine . The product review makes it clear that sneaker soles have become a fascinating ' ' canvas ' ' for shoemakers . Form , as well as function , is obviously important in today ' s fiercely competitive market , and manufacturers are going to great lengths to make visual statements - even where seldom seen. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more sane format for Davis Cup matches . There is now considerable support for using tiebreakers rather than waiting until a player wins a set by at least two games , which has led to some rather ghastly marathons . The most notable recent example , perhaps , was the 6-hour , 38-minute match played last July in Hartford , Ct. , when Boris Becker outlasted John McEnroe , 4-6 , 15-13 , 8-10 , 6-2 , 6-2 . The proposed change , which would call for tiebreakers in all but fifth sets , will go on the table at the International Tennis Federation ' s annual meeting in July. // * Retractable domed stadiums , such as the one being built in Toronto , may offer the ideal solution for those who want the best of both worlds - natural daylight when the weather cooperates , a roof overhead when it doesn ' t . These ' ' convertibles ' ' could create a dilemma , though , since somebody must decide when the dome goes on and off. // //         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
