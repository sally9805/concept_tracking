Most evenings between 8 and 10 , George Bush excuses himself from the company of friends and family in order to be alone . As he has done for years , he retreats to a private study , now on the second floor of the White House , to read and write cards and thank-you notes to friends , political allies and even perfect strangers . This ever growing list of correspondents has served Bush well in difficult times , and may soon do so again . Last week the President added a new name to his address book : that of Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani . <P> The two men are hardly likely to become pen pals . But as the U.S. Government once again searched for a way to free American hostages held in the Middle East , Bush 's communications with Rafsanjani have moved from cautious feelers through intermediaries to more direct , leader-to-leader messages . Working closely with his top foreign policy advisers , the President personally authored several of the diplomatic notes sent to Iran through Swiss embassy channels . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush was at pains to steer clear of the mistakes that toppled Jimmy Carter 's presidency and badly tarnished Ronald Reagan 's . While pointedly refusing to offer any quid pro quo , he stepped carefully back from Reagan 's stated policy of never negotiating with terrorists . If the hostages come home , Bush hinted , he might consider releasing Iranian assets  --  principally undelivered weapons paid for in advance  --  that have been frozen by the U.S. since 1979 . " Goodwill begets goodwill , " he said , quoting his own Inaugural Address . <P> George Bush 's handling of the hostage crisis illustrates some of the main characteristics of his decision-making style : <P>  --  He is a cautious , reactive President , whose first concern in a crisis is to avoid mistakes . <P>  --  Bush cares deeply about a handful of core values  --  family , loyalty , service to country  --  but regards almost everything else as negotiable . <P>  --  He searches out advice and prefers to choose among alternatives rather than devise his own solutions . " Have Half , " his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split the difference . <P>  --  When persuasive leadership is required , Bush instinctively reaches not for a TV camera but for a telephone , working his will among fellow heads of state and Washington insiders rather than through Reagan-like appeals to public opinion . <P>  --  Guided by an inner clock that sometimes frustrates his aides , Bush decides at his own speed and rarely looks back in doubt later . <P> After seven months as President , Bush has emerged as a much more complex Commander in Chief than expected , a hybrid of presidential personalities served and observed . Bush possesses Lyndon Johnson 's penchant for secrecy , without retributive sense of justice . He has Richard Nixon 's feel for foreign policy , but so far lacks his mentor 's grip on grand strategy . He shares Jimmy Carter 's fascination with the fine details of government , but understands better which pieces are most important . Bush says he learned from Reagan the importance of stubborn principle in politics , but he sees more clearly than Reagan the sweet reason of expedient compromise .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
