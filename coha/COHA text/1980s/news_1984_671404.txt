// When officials of St. Bartholomew ' s Episcopal Church in 1981 unveiled the first design for the skyscraper they hope to build beside their landmark church on Park Avenue , the tower of reflective glass by Edward Durell Stone Associates was so inappropriate that the question seemed not whether the city ' s Landmarks Preservation Commission would reject it , but when. // Though both the church and the Landmarks Commission took their time in presenting the design and deliberating over it , the answer , when it finally came last June , was just what had been expected . The commission said no , and its members denounced the building so vehemently that another question soon arose - could any office tower at this site win the commission ' s approval ? <> <> A Revised Design // The coming year seems fairly certain to provide an answer , for St. Bartholomew ' s went before the Landmarks Commission last week to try again with a new , and substantially revised , design . The architect is the same - Peter Capone , president of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more different . Indeed , like a politician who runs against his own record , Mr. Capone ' s new design renounces every principle of his first one. // Well , almost every principle . It is still a skyscraper , still to be shoehorned into a tight site on already overcrowded Park Avenue . But the specifics of the design could not be more different. // The new plan is for a 47-story skyscraper , not a 59-story one , and it calls for a building of masonry instead of glass . The zigzagged , sawtooth shape of the original St. Bartholomew ' s tower proposal has been replaced by a building that has numerous setbacks , tapering at the top to a fairly narrow , stepped-back crown . <> <> Romantic Skyscrapers // It is a design that , like so many skyscrapers today , takes its inspiration from the romantic skyscrapers of the 1920 ' s and 1930 ' s . Mr. Capone has obviously been looking at the RCA Building at Rockefeller Center , the tower that has come in the last decade to equal the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied the General Electric Building on Lexington Avenue just behind St. Bartholomew ' s as well. // More important still , he appears finally to have begun to look at the church itself , the splendid , Byzantine-inspired mass by Bertram Goodhue that is one of New York ' s great religious structures . St. Bartholomew ' s Church and its attached community house - which would be demolished under either skyscraper plan , with community house facilities to be replaced in the base of the tower - are built of warm orange brick , with limestone trim . The church and community house mount upward in a sumptuous mass , their forms relieved by delicate and precise detail . <> <> Original Design // // To put a stark tower of reflective glass like the one originally proposed beside a building like St. Bartholomew ' s is not to complement the old church ; it is to defy it . The original design seemed to render the church meaningless and trivial , as if relating to its architecture were beneath the dignity of a contemporary architect. // Whatever else can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a result of pure pragmatism - a recognition of the fact that a design like the original would not be likely to win public support no matter how hard the church tried to appeal the Landmarks Commission ' s decision - or a result of a more benign architectural philosophy taking over is impossible to know . But whatever the reason , the architect , and the governing officials of St. Bartholomew ' s , have clearly experienced some sort of Epiphany at this Christmas season. // The new design seems earnestly to try to relate to the complex and difficult site on which the community house now stands - a tiny square bounded by St. Bartholomew ' s itself on the northwest , the fine General Electric tower on the northeast , the simple and restrained 560 Lexington Avenue building on the east and , across 50th Street , the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on the south. // These buildings all share a common vocabulary of materials , and by using limestone and orange brick , the proposed new tower unites itself to them instead of standing apart . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original scheme , and its lack of great mass makes it at least somewhat less intrusive than it would otherwise have been . <> <> An Impressive Reminder // // The General Electric tower , completed in 1931 and designed by Cross &; Cross with the deliberate intention of harmonizing with St. Bartholomew ' s , has always been an impressive reminder that it is possible to relate a skyscraper to a low , monumental building . It is among the city ' s best such examples , and it has always been there teaching its architectural lessons , right beside the site on which St. Bartholomew ' s once planned its glass tower. // But the lessons that the General Electric tower teaches are not as simple as they seem , and to observe that this new design is thinner in shape and more respectful in its materials is not to say that its architect has learned everything that this older church and skyscraper combination has to teach. // The real lesson of the General Electric-St . Bartholomew ' s combination is that it takes considerable subtlety and restraint to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And this new design , greatly improved though it is , could hardly be called subtle . The overall shape is nervous and overactive , as if the architect , once he had learned to make 1930 ' s-style setbacks , did not know how to stop. // More of a problem is the detailing at the base , which appears to be heavy-handed and crude - stark , cut- out squares of limestone , perfect for a bank but lacking any of the delicacy and lyricism of either the General Electric Building or St. Bartholomew ' s itself . <> <> The Larger Question // // So this building is hardly there yet , changed though it is . And , of course , there is the larger question that still hovers behind this and any design for this site . No matter how " appropriate " it is , to use the word the Landmarks Commission uses as its standard for judgment , any skyscraper built beside St. Bartholomew ' s will change the nature of this landmark permanently . The church will never again look the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its great south rose window , and the church will always appear more crowded , more tightly compressed in midtown Manhattan. // And though the official charge of the Landmarks Preservation Commission is landmarks , and not planning , it is impossible for outside observers to ignore the planning implications of building on this site. // Park Avenue , and all of midtown in the East 50 ' s , is seriously overbuilt already . The present St. Bartholomew ' s complex is the one piece of open space and sky left there - and whether it should be sacrificed for any building , whatever the design , is the real issue the city must face. // //
