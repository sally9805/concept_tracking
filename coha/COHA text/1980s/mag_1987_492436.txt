66 to see him , " says his sister Anne Eisenhower . " He gets the same look on his face as when we used to play baseball as kids . " There 's only one problem , Betsy Reimer says : " He gets upset because he 'll make a beautiful hit and the dog will catch it . " In some ways , the Eisenhowers ' life is normal to the point of tedium . There 's spaghetti at Fonzo 's ( before it burned down ) , takeout pizza at the Reimers ' , Memorial Day barbecues . In other ways , it does seem a little unusual . For example , David must be the only suburban dad in America who wears hand-me-down suits from two former presidents . When Julie 's parents come for a visit , as they often do , there 's an extra player for wiffle ball  --  a Secret Service man . And not many people can pick up a Trivial Pursuit card and realize they are the answer . Not that David  --  an old board-game junkie  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good we wo n't let them play on the same team , " Betsy Reimer says . " Dave gets so excited . 1 wo n't let him sit at my dining-room table because one time he jumped up and almost went through the breakfront . " And David , at least , spends each // working day with reminders of his special legacy . He has spent most of the past ten years laboring over a mammoth biography of his grand-father , Dwight David Eisenhower , the first volume of which ( 1,600 type-written pages ) was published by Ran-dom House in June 1986 . And for the past four years he has been a visiting lecturer in political science at the Uni-versity of Pennsylvania , where the door to his office on the second floor of Stiteler Hall says DWIGHT DAVID EISENHOWER 11 . Still , things are different now . When the glare of the strobe light is no longer upon you , life is sweeter . " These have been the happiest years I 've known , " Julie says . " I 'm so grateful for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade it for anything in the world . " This is a sentiment with which David concurs . Yet he , at least , would also say that his boyhood taste of fame  --  before everything turned sour  --  was intoxicating and wonderful . The Nixon years were actually David 's second stint at the White House . His father , John , worked for Ike , and David , eight years old as the second term began in 1957 , would stay with his grandparents for weeks at a time . Maybe it was the crew cut , maybe it was the mischievous grin  --  there was something about David that suggested the prototypical American boy . Much later , he would write about those years in terms that suggest the protoJan. /Feb. ' 87 typical American boyhood : " For a child , the White House was and is a paradise . What 's now the press room used to be a heated indoor pool equipped with shower and workout facilities . The East Wing housed a movie theater that ran top Hollywood selections at the virtual request of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter out of the wide third-floor corridor leading to the storage and laundry rooms , and in the spring I practiced infield by bouncing tennis balls off the even-surfaced walls . The South Lawn was the backyard of any child 's dreams . I raced electric carts along the sloping driveway , and the trees provided perfect ' cover ' for grade-school cowboys and Indians . The open expanse of grass was a perfect place to play golf . " Julie Nixon was in Washington then , too  --  her father being vice-president and all  --  but , oddly , she did n't see much of David . " I remember the first time I met him , " she says now . " It was in 1957 , right after the inauguration . I still remember the menu , because it was only my second time in the White House . I 'd never seen a ring of rice that stands up . And there was creamed chicken in the middle , with peas . " In 1961 , both children left Washington  --  David because his grandfather 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost to John F. Kennedy . On 12-year-old David 's last night in the White House , he was despondent . But even then he found solace in historical allusions . Like a preteen MacArthur , he wandered the halls and sneaked notes reading " I shall return " into various nooks and crannies . He did n't see Julie again until college . At Amherst , David was , of course , nice . Tom Boswell , now a sportswriter at the Washington Post , had gone to grade school with David and arrived at college a year ahead of him . " 1 did n't want to impose on an old acquaintanceship , " Boswell says . " 1 figured people bothered him all the time because of who he was . One night I was sitting in the vending-machine room and he came up to me . He said , ' You probably do n't remember me . I 'm David Eisenhower . ' " ( In his book Why Life Imitates the World Series , Boswell recalls another encounter with David : " In the late ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus , it was hard to find other 20-year-olds who wanted to play stickball . But gradually we discovered each other  --  Eric Landis , a bulldog catcher from the Bronx , a tall pitcher named Lewis , and a big-eared poli-sci major named Eisenhower . Landis and I stood Lewis and Eisenhower one balmy day for what we could safely call the Amherst College stickball championship . No other teams were entered . . . I do n't remember the score or who won , but I remember my last home run , a towering poke to the dorm roof off David . I always said you could n't learn real iEL stickball on the South Lawn . " ) Julie  --  at Smith College , just seven miles away  --  met up with David in 1966 , their freshman year , when both // were asked to speak for a local Republican candidate . After talking it over on the phone , they both said no . But , as Julie says , David must have liked the sound of her voice , for a few days later they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julie and the other girl wound up paying because David and the other boy had no money on them . Their second date was on the night of the 1966 election . " That was a big night for the Republicans , " David says . " The Republican party of today started that night . We picked up 47 House seats . And Ronald Reagan was elected governor of California . " They were engaged just after the next election night and married soon after the next one . Even before then , of course , we had started to see their faces everywhere . They were an odd but somehow endearing couple , the vivacious , slim , brown-haired Julie , and the somewhat less-at-ease David , usually described by reporters as " gangly " or " tousle-haired " or " jug-eared " or sometimes all three . Their wedding in New York was performed by an old family friend , Dr. Norman Vincent Peale , and the reception for 400 was at the Plaza Hotel .

" We wanted something that would last beyond that . " Twenty is a young age to be married , but it was a good choice for David and Julie , if only because it gave each of them a live-in ballast against the day 's hurts . And as the protest against the Vietnam War grew , David and Julie became ever more visible tar-gets of abuse and ridicule . " On opening day in 1969 , David went down to Wash-ington to throw out the first ball of the baseball season , " Tom Boswell says . " I remem-ber a political-science pro-fessor who made a sarcastic remark to the whole class , ' Well , I see it 's more important for Eisenhower to go to a baseball game than attend class . ' " Cheap shots like that were relatively easy to dismiss . Other slights cut deeper . When the brother           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
