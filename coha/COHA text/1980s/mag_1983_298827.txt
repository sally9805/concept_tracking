A nation in mourning points a finger at its northern neighbor <P> Barely a month after the Soviet downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 , flags were again at half-staff throughout South Korea . Nightclubs , bars and movie theaters were shut down for three days ; store clerks , officeworkers and government officials wore black ties or black ribbons of mourning . As the flag-draped coffins were brought home , the anguished wails of newly widowed women and bereft families once again echoed through the corridors of Seoul 's Kimpo Airport . <P> On Thursday , more than a million South Koreans gathered in a chill rain for an emotional memorial service in Seoul 's huge Sixteenth of May Plaza . On a long altar surrounded by thousands of white and yellow chrysanthemums , 17 incense urns were placed in front of photographs of the deceased . Later , military pallbearers wearing white masks , a traditional mark of respect for the dead , led the procession to the cemetery . Representatives from 47 countries were present , including a seven-member U.S. delegation headed by Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Korean Prime Minister Kim Sang Hyup asked : " Can words properly describe our bitterness ? Can any words help control our wrath ? " <P> This time the mourning was for 17 South Koreans , including four Cabinet ministers and ten key government officials , who had been killed when a bomb ripped through the Martyr 's Mausoleum in the Burmese capital , Rangoon . The South Korean delegation had gathered at the site for a wreath-laying ceremony at the beginning of what was to have been an 18-day tour of South Asian and Pacific countries . South Korean President Chun Doo Hwan , 52 , the apparent target of the attack , had not yet arrived at the ceremony and escaped unharmed . <P> The attack ended a diplomatic initiative that had begun with high expectations and that was to have broadened South Korea 's ties to other nations in the region . Burma 's President U San Yu condemned the bombing as a " premeditated and dastardly act " by terrorists who he said were seeking to disrupt relations between his government and South Korea .

" Both India and Australia were to have been hosts to the Koreans later on the tour . In Los Angeles , 600 Koreans attended a memorial service at the Wilshire United Methodist Church . Said Korean Consul Moon Ik Chang : " We are very shattered . " <P> Upon his return to Seoul , President Chun described the bombing as a " tenacious provocation by the band of Communists in North Korea . " A possible motive : North Korean frustration over South Korea 's increasingly active diplomacy toward nations that , like Burma , maintain ties with North Korea . The government of North Korea called the accusation " preposterous and ridiculous . " Police in Rangoon arrested two Koreans last week , though there was no confirmation that they were from the North . The Burmese reported that another Korean was killed when he tried to escape arrest .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
