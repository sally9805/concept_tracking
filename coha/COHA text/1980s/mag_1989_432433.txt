 | On the evening of December 19 , 1985 , Marybeth Tinning , 42 , and Cynthia Walter , 31 , next-door neighbors in Schenectady , N.Y. , went Christmas shopping for their three-month-old babies . Marybeth , a former waitress and ambulance driver , and Cynthia , a practical nurse , became close friends while both were pregnant . There was one big difference in their situations . Little Aaron was Cynthia 's only child . Tami Lynne was Marybeth 's ninth child , eight horn to her and one adopted . And all but Tami Lynne had died . Marybeth told Cynthia and her friends that a rare genetic disease had doomed her babies . Cynthia was overwhelmed by the sadness of Marybeth 's life . So was another neighbor , Sue Lencewicz , for whose little boy Marybeth sometimes baby-sat . Sue was dubious about the deaths until Marybeth showed her the row of grave markers . The sight was unbearably poi- gnant . " God bless you , Marybeth , " she said , " that you can still be sane after losing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived through , Marybeth was friendly , generous , and almost childlike in her eagerness to please . She offered such warmth and affection that it was hard not to care about her . Her husband of 20 years , Joe Tinning , a foreman in a large electrical plant , was the opposite in personality . A slightly built , balding man , Joe could spend a whole eveping silently in front of a TV screen . " If you switched it off , " one neighbor remarked , " he 'd just go on sitting there , saying nothing . " At about 8:30 P.M. , after the shopping trip with Marybeth , Cynthia stopped briefly at the Tinnings ' , where she held a cooing Tami Lynne . But at 1:15 A.M. she was awakened by a panic-stricken call from Marybeth . She rushed next door , where she began cardiopulmonary resuscitation on an apparently lifeless Tami Lynne . Marybeth told her that she 'd put the baby into her crib , then gone to her own bedroom and dozed until Joe arrived home from bowling shortly after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she moved to the sofa in the living room . A little later she checked on the baby and found her on her stomach , very still , and not breathing . In shock , she screamed for her husband , phoned for an ambulance , called her friend Cynthia , and tried to revive Tami Lynne with CPR . Cynthia accompanied the Tin-  | was clear . In January 1986 Dr. Oram determined that suffocation was the cause of Tami Lynne 's death ( and possibly all the others but Jennifer 's . ) Marybeth was taken to the police barracks on February 4 , 1986 . She was nervous and fidgety but stuck to her original story of how Tami Lynne died . Bill Barnes , an exceptionally skilled investigator who had known Marybeth since childhood , knew that the key to the situation was Joe . If she were to be accused of murder , she 'd fear that most of her friends and relatives would desert her , including , possibly , Joe . Barnes judged that Marybeth would go on lying forever rather than forfeit his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity for loyalty . Barnes talked privately with Joe , telling him that the police believed Marybeth had caused most of their children 's deaths . " If Marybeth did do anything to the children , " he said , " she needs help . Would you stand by her ? " Without hesitation , Joe said " Yes . " The two men went in to see Marybeth . Barnes told her that a forensic team had ruled Tami Lynne 's death a homicide . There were strong suspicions she had caused the deaths of her other children . " I did n't do it , I did n't do it , " she kept saying . Then Barnes played his trump card . Addressing Joe , he asked , " If for some reason Marybeth did do something to Tami Lynne and the others , what would you do , Joe ? " " I 'd stand by her , " Joe replied . Barnes turned to Marybeth . " Now I want you to tell Joe the truth . " Marybeth gulped , tears in her eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I killed my children . " She began to sob . Joe , silent , did not move from his chair . Barnes went through the names of her nine children , asking her to explain how each died . She insisted that most had died naturally . But she admitted suffocating Timothy and Nathan with pillows . She said that Tami Lynne had been crying , so she put a pillow over her face until the crying stopped . lit " Why did you do that ? " " Because she was always crying and I could n't do anything right . " She told him that she had grown up feeling incompetent and when her children became ill or cried a lot , she assumed it was because she was a bad mother . And since she was a bad mother , she put a pillow over Tami Lynne 's face . . and Timothy 's . . . and Nathan 's . Marybeth seemed relieved to unburden herself and , in a childlike way , appeared to think that now she would be forgiven and sent home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then formally charged with murder and driv- en to Schenectady County Jail . Once in jail , Marybeth changed her story , asserting she was innocent of murdering any of the children . She claimed to have confessed under duress . But fifteen months after her arrest she was tried for second degree murder . The judge limited the testimony to Tami Lynne . Marybeth pleaded not guilty . The trial lasted six weeks . At all times Marybeth appeared in complete command of herself . Joe , supportive as ever , sat beside her . On July 17 , 1987 , the jury found Marybeth guilty of second degree murder , and eleven weeks later she was sentenced to 20 years at Bedford Hills , N.Y. , Correctional Institute . Her lawyer appealed , but the appeal was denied . These are the bare outlines of the Marybeth Tinning case . But it is not just a horror story like those Marybeth herself was fond of reading . Instead , it raises two sobering questions : How , in the course of 13 years , in a relatively small city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one after another , most of them within a few months of birth ? and no official investigation take place until the ninth child died ? And ? a question that may never be satisfactorily answered ? Why ? The answer to the How is complex . Certainly , after the first few deaths , suspicion began to arise in some quarters . When Marybeth 's fifth child , Nathan , died , her co-workers at Flavorland publicly sympathized with her , but privately shared their doubts with each other : Had losing all those babies affected her mind ? After the next death , that of Mary Frances , several waitresses who had attended the earlier funerals , acted on their suspicions . Wrenched by the sight of all those babies in their caskets , exquisitely formed and eternally still , dressed up like dolls in boxes , they had called the local Social Services , but never heard back . By this time , some of the hospital personnel at St. Clare 's , who had dealt with several of the infant deaths , were also suspicious of Marybeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question Marybeth , but no action was taken . As the deaths continued , other calls were made to social services and the child abuse hot line . Even Carol Tinning , Marybeth 's sister-in-law , who had lived through the deaths of several of Marybeth 's natural children in uneasy acceptance of the theory of the rare genetic disease , was deeply troubled when Michael , the adopted child , who could not have inherited the fatal defect , died . When Marybeth became pregnant with the last child , Tami Lynne , Carol warned her bluntly , " Do n't you dare let anything happen to this baby . " She then  | kept a watchful eye on her sister-in-law and the new baby . When Tami Lynne died , Carol 's bitter tears were not just for her . They were for her own failure to save this baby , and , perhaps , the others . Why was no official action taken earlier ? With no suggestion of mistreatment in the babies ' lifetimes ? Marybeth seemed a devoted mother ? social workers had no abuses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder clues . Besides , at each death , a reputable doctor had certified a plausible cause . And then there was the genetic-flaw theory . Above all , perhaps , it was almost impossible to suspect that a woman who was so babyhungry that she kept having one child after another , and adopted one to boot , would want to kill them . The most heart-rending question , however , is Why . Marybeth confessed to killing only three of her nine children , insisting that the others died of natural causes , but even if that were true , what led her to kill at all ? Before the trial , her defense attorney was asked if he would use an insanity plea , but Marybeth insisted that she was sane and innocent . Her friends , it is true , found her a little strange , but thought her troubles entitled her to be . When she started work as a waitress at Flavorland after the death of her first three children , no one , apparently , saw her erratic conduct ? orangey hair , stagey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events into melodrama ? as desperate bids for attention and admiration . Later , when she served as a volunteer ambulance driver , she loved driving at high speed with the siren screaming . She bragged about giving a life-saving blood transfusion and delivering a baby singlehanded . Probably neither story was true . Over the years Marybeth confided to women friends about stern parents who locked her in her room , once for an entire day . There were hints of abuse . She still felt resentment for her father , who died just before her third child was born . She worried about her ability to be a good mother . " If I 'd been a good mother , " she told her friend Cynthia before Tami Lynne 's death , " my other babies would n't have died . " What do doctors say about Marybeth ? Dr. Bruce Beckwith , chairman of the department of pathology at the Children 's Hospital in Denver , Colo. , and an expert in SIDS , who concurred in the finding of suffocation by smothering of Tami Lynne , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both mothers reacted to the natural death of an infant by trying to suffocate subsequent babies . He explains , " The mind can be so shell-shocked by the first loss that there is a need to work through the grief by recreating the experience . It 's as though the mother tries to punish herself , over and over , for her first baby 's death . " It was , of course , after the natural death of Marybeth Tinning 's third child , Jennifer , that the train of horrors began . Another possible explanation could be the existence of a rare psychological condition known as Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy . In this complex form of child abuse , a woman who morbidly craves attention uses her child as a pawn in a weird battle of wits with the medical authorities by deliberately making the infant ill . Women of this type enjoy sitting around hospitals feeling important . Marybeth fits , at least partially , into this pattern . But what the whole terrible , and at the same time pitiful , design may be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at Bedford Hills , where inmates with newborns may keep them in the prison nursery for up to a year . Marybeth has often been seen lurking around the nursery . Many of the mothers say they are afraid of her .
