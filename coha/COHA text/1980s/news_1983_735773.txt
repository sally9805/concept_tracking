txt Affiliated Bank Corp . of Wyoming said it expects a third-quarter deficit of about $1.8 million and said its board approved a tentative acquisition by a private investor for about $50 million . The eight-bank holding company cited loan write-downs for the loss . It said its lead bank , Wyoming National Bank of Casper , charged off about $6 million of nonperforming oil and gas loans , resulting in an indicated net loss for the quarter of about $1.50 a share . That deficit would compare with profit of $1.1 million , or 92 cents a share ; for the 1982 third quarter . The company said the loan write-offs would result in estimated profit of about $595,000 , or 50 cents a share , for the nine months , down from $4.2 million , or $3.54 a share , a year earlier . A company spokesman estimated the bank holding company has between $1 million and $1.5 million in nonperforming loans after the write-offs , though the precise figure has n't been calculated . The company currently has total loans of about $300 million . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total assets of $533.6 million and total deposits of about $453.7 million , the spokesman said . An official for the bank holding company said the write-offs are unrelated to the acquisition proposal . The official added that the announcements of write-offs and acquisition proposal were made simultaneously to ensure that shareholders of the holding company were n't led to sell or buy its stock based on " only half the story " about recent events . The company said F. O'Neil Griffin , formerly chairman of Mountain Banks Ltd. , Denver , plans to form a new company , Financial Resources of Wyoming Inc. , that would acquire Affiliated Bank 's approximately 1.2 million common shares outstanding for $42 a share , or about $50 million . Terms of the proposal by Mr. Griffin call for the purchase price of the bank holding company to be adjusted according to its pershare earnings or losses after March 31 , 1984 , if the merger is n't completed by that date , Affiliated said . Affiliated common shares were quoted at $36 bid , up $6 , in over-the-counter trading yesterday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Griffin for the acquisition , approval by Affiliated holders and approval by the Federal Reserve Board , Affiliated said . Mr. Griffin , currently living in Kerrville , Texas , said he plans to take part in the holding company 's management , but retain Affiliated 's current management , if the acquisition is completed . He added that he was aware of the bank holding company 's loan write-offs before proposing the acquisition plan . " The write-offs are n't all that bad . " he said . " I do n't regard them at all as a major factor . " Mr. Griffin said he is currently acting alone in the proposed plan to take Affiliated private but is seeking other investors to take part in the transaction . He added , however , that assistance from other investors is " not absolutely necessary " for completion of the transaction . Robert W. Miracle , president and chief executive officer , attributed the write-offs to the oil-industry slump and added that " we think the worst is behind us , even though it will take time for the oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hoped the company 's earnings would return to " historical levels " during the fourth quarter 1983 and first part of 1984.
