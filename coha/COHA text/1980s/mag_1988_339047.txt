Mohammed Zia ul-Haq spent his last hours on a dusty patch of desert in remote Bahawalpur , 330 miles south of Islamabad , Pakistan 's capital . Accompanied by U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel , the Pakistani President watched field tests of the American-made M-1 Abrams tank , which he was interested in buying for his country 's army . After spending the day observing the high-tech vehicle climb around the dunes , Zia , Raphel and a large entourage boarded a U.S.-built C-130 transport to fly back to the military airport at Rawalpindi , near Islamabad . <P> The plane was in the air no more than a few minutes when disaster struck . Witnesses say black smoke belched from the aircraft 's fuselage . Seconds later the plane was engulfed in a ball of fire , and villagers on the ground watched with horror as it plummeted to the earth , tumbling nose over tail like a toy as it fell . The huge turboprop bounced twice after hitting the sandy plain , then came down a third and final time , exploding on impact . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Raphel , 45 ; Brigadier General Herbert Wassom , 49 , the chief of the U.S. military mission in Pakistan ; and five top Pakistani generals . " It was so hot we could not get close , " said a distressed villager who rushed to the scene . " We could not help them . " <P> The crash , which officials immediately labeled suspicious , came at a crucial time for Pakistan and the entire region in which Zia had made himself a major diplomatic player . During his eleven years in power , longer than any other Pakistani head of state , Zia brooked little opposition at home and failed to groom a successor . Last May he summarily dismissed his handpicked civilian government and reestablished one-man rule , thus ensuring a legacy of political disarray . Said Benazir Bhutto , whose Pakistan People 's Party has led recent agitation to restore civilian rule : " I do not regret the death of Zia . " <P> Abroad , Zia pursued a shrewd foreign policy that aligned him squarely with the West . He used the 1979 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make Pakistan the West 's bulwark in Southwest Asia . He welcomed some 3 million Afghan refugees who poured over Pakistan 's western border to escape the civil war , and enthusiastically helped ship U.S. and Chinese arms to the Afghan rebels . His reward : more than $700 million this year in U.S. aid . Secretary of State George Shultz last week called Zia a " great fighter for freedom . " Shultz led the U.S. delegation to Zia 's Saturday funeral in Islamabad , which was thronged by 200,000 mourners . Robert Oakley , the Near East expert for the National Security Council , has been designated the new U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan . <P> Zia was succeeded by Ghulam Ishaq Khan , 73 , who as chairman of the Senate was next in line to the presidency . Regarded widely as a transitional figure , Ishaq Khan declared a state of emergency and appointed an emergency council that the military is expected to dominate . He heartened Pakistan 's democratic opposition , however , by announcing that elections would take place in November as planned .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
