STORIES IN AN ALMOST CLASSICAL MODE <P> by Harold Brodkey <P> Knopf ; 596 pages ; $24.95 <P> Over the decades , Harold Brodkey has become the darling of what might be called the Grecian Urn School of literary critics ( " Heard melodies are sweet , but those unheard are sweeter " ) . Brodkey 's enormous reputation does not stem from his first book , a collection of nine short stories published back in 1957 , but from a novel , Party of Animals , that he famously refuses to finish . To be sure , Brodkey 's short fiction has occasionally appeared in magazines over the intervening decades . But it is his lonely struggle to produce a big book that has impressed some pretty influential folks . Yale professor Harold Bloom calls Brodkey " unparalleled in American prose fiction since the death of William Faulkner . " Susan Sontag says Brodkey is " going for real stakes . I read every word he writes . " The author , who lives on Manhattan 's Upper West Side , has sometimes been willing to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be as good a writer as I. " <P> Under these circumstances , publishing anything might seem an unacceptable risk . Why encumber a reputation with evidence ? Nevertheless , here comes Stories in an Almost Classical Mode , which collects 18 pieces that have appeared over the past 25 years , many of them in The New Yorker . The book 's arrival has been accompanied by a fire storm of respectful publicity , illustrated with photographs of the author looking pensive or , in some instances , mildly worried , as if he had let himself in for some discouraging words . <P> He is right . Readers who do not understand what the hubbub is about will leave this book little the wiser . Brodkey is obviously talented , but his skills are quirky and obsessive , perhaps more mesmerizing to him than to casual spectators . There is Innocence , for example , which contains what is probably the longest description of oral sex in the history of literature . ( This story decidedly did not appear in The New Yorker . ) For page after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stubbornly unresponsive girlfriend to orgasm : " The whitish bubbling , the splash of her discontinuous physical response : those waves , ah , that wake rose , curled outward , bubbled , and fell . Rose , curled outward , bubbled , and fell . " Little in this prose marathon is particularly erotic or offensive ; it is possible for long periods of time to forget entirely what is supposed to be going on . The point of the exercise seems to be verbal ingenuity , coupled with the message that pleasure can be damned hard , long work . <P> In contrast to such hyperpituitary passages , On the Waves opens with a comparatively terse Venetian scene : " In the churning wake of a motorboat from one of the luxury hotels , the gondola bobbed with graceful disequilibrium . The tall , thin , handsome man sitting in the gondola gripped the sides of the small wooden craft and said to his seven-year-old daughter , ' Hold on . ' He thought , Gondolas are atavistic . " Never mind that adjectives here are pulling more weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terminal apercu . Nothing that follows in this brief , intermittently charming story about a man and his daughter quite obliterates an annoying question : How , exactly , are gondolas atavistic ?
