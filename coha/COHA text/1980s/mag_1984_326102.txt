American Public Radio 's popularity is quietly growing <P> Just listen . The jaunty fiddling of a Celtic folk song . The stammering voice of Melville 's Billy Budd protesting his innocence . The Los Angeles Philharmonic 's rousing rendition of Beethoven 's Fifth . And the husky , down-home inflections of Garrison Keillor inviting one and all to drop in on the imaginary hamlet of Lake Wobegon , " the little town that time forgot and that decades can not improve . " <P> Sound tantalizing ? Well , it is all within earshot if your radio is tuned to one of the 277 American Public Radio affiliates across the country , any one of which might feature just such an eclectic sampling . These stations air not only Keillor 's whimsically witty Prairie Home Companion but a diverse medley of classical music programs including High Performance , a kind of Great Performances of jazz , classical and folk music , and highlights of music festivals from Bayreuth to Spoleto . APR takes its culture-vulturing seriously : with 70% of its programming consisting of classical music , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington cousin , the public-affairs-oriented National Public Radio , APR 'S bread-and-butter is broadcasting local cultural programming across the country via satellite . Indeed , through its Los Angeles affiliate , the network broadcast 20 events of the Olympic Arts Festival in full , including three Royal Opera performances . And they have done it all on a shoe-string budget of $775,000 , with a full-time staff of ten hardy souls at their modest St. Paul headquarters . <P> At the moment , APR 's main problem is that people confuse it with National Public Radio . As APR Manager Rhoda Marx notes , " NPR was the only game in town for so long that the press and the public are locked into thinking of it as a generic rather than a brand name . " Created in January 1982 by five major public radio stations ( WNYC of New York , WGUC of Cincinnati , KQED of San Francisco , KUSC of Los Angeles and Minnesota Public Radio ) , APR has never produced its own shows , like NPR , but has acquired , distributed and marketed cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ APR 's programs are produced by the " founding five . " Supported 45% by grants , APR charges affiliates a pittance , a mere $1,500 a year for stations in the top 30 markets . <P> The reasons for APR 'S quietly spreading popularity are obvious : quality , price and originality . William Kling , APR 'S president , sees the network 's role as a distinctive one . Says he : " Our incentive is different ; we can go for quality instead of profit . " For APR 'S chairman of the board , Kenneth Dayton , the reports of radio 's demise are greatly exaggerated . " When TV came along , people thought radio was a medium of the past . Now we realize how much radio can do that TV ca n't . " And wo n't . <P> - By Richard Stengel . <P> Reported by Elaine Dutka/New York
