ACQUITTED . Jack Elder , 41 , Roman Catholic activist in the sanctuary-movement network of some 200 U.S. church congregations that harbor illegal immigrants fleeing violence-shattered Central American countries ; of charges that last March he transported three undocumented Salvadorans from a San Benito , Texas , refuge to a bus station " in furtherance of their illegal presence " in the U.S. ; in Corpus Christi , Texas . A federal judge ruled that Elder 's conduct was based on his religious beliefs ; the jury concluded that Elder 's actions did not further the aliens ' illegal journey . A Government spokesman says that the verdict will not interfere with the prosecution of sanctuary-movement participants or with prosecution of Elder on other charges .
