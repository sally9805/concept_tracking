The epic oil plunge of the 1980s started out slowly and a bit remotely . To most people , it was just a downward-sloping diagram on the financial page , an abstract reminder of the mysterious world of desert oil wells , filthy-rich Arabs and the irritating antics of OPEC . But suddenly oil 's new situation is hitting home with the wallop of a 42-gal. oil barrel dropped on the front porch . Last week consumers , businessmen and traders around the world watched in awe as the price of crude dipped below $10 per bbl. for the first time in almost a decade . Oil , which as recently as January was selling for $26 per bbl. , was on a breathtaking  --  and dangerous  --  ride down a slippery slope . <P> For citizens in petroleum-gulping countries from the U.S. to South Korea , oil so cheap is an unexpected and unbelievable windfall . A Vermont homeowner may enjoy a heating-fuel bill cut nearly in half next winter . An Italian consumer can celebrate the lowest inflation in 14 years . A family in Chad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertilizers have become less expensive . A motorist in the Philippines can enjoy a 30% drop in the price of premium gas . <P> The fortunate ones can scarcely enjoy their energy feast , however , without noticing the look of distress on the faces of their neighbors . For the same plunge that benefits oil users has battered the regions that produce petroleum . In Saudi Arabia , an Egyptian worker is likely to lose his high- paying job and return home to poverty . A Mexico City family may no longer be able to afford meat and vegetables because government food subsidies have been slashed . A well-drilling entrepreneur in Oklahoma could face bankruptcy and the loss of his business to creditors . A bank loan officer in California may be forced into a different career because the oil-lending business has declined . <P> Like the petroleum crisis of the past decade , which threatened the industrial might of the West , the oil slide is changing the balance of economic power . The price drop , from a peak of $35 per bbl. in 1981 , has greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consuming countries to the producers . The so-called petrodollar drain of 1979-83 had contributed to the worst global economic slump since the Great Depression . But cheap oil will act as a giant tax cut , or perhaps a lottery jackpot , for the consumers and businesses of such large industrial countries as the U.S. , West Germany and Japan . Many economists think that bargain petroleum will bring a go-go era of healthy growth that could last until the early 1990s . Citizens are likely to enjoy a garden of economic delights , including a better chance of finding jobs , and lower prices for petroleum-based products ranging from polyester clothing to phonograph records ( see following stories ) .
