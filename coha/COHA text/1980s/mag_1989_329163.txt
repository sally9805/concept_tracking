May I at all times be free <P> Of the four nether realms <P> The three scoundrels <P> The eight inauspicious locations <P> And the five enemies . . . <P> In Burma 's myriad pagodas , those words from the Buddhist Okasa prayer are often on the lips of worshipers these days . They are an incantation against the five enemies  --  water , fire , robbers , people who wish evil on others , and rulers . Down through the centuries , it is the last category that has been most feared . But rarely in living memory have the Burmese so urgently believed they needed protection from their rulers . <P> The despondency has grown out of 27 years of one-man misrule . Under the authoritarian leadership of General Ne Win and his military cohorts , the country has been beggared and its people forced into silence . Last week , the first anniversary of explosive antigovernment riots , Burmese were suffering through a renewed campaign of repression . For the ruling junta , which has changed the nation 's name to Myanmar to reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National League for Democracy , the first organized , broad-based movement dedicated to democratic reform since Ne Win came to power in a 1962 military coup . In recent weeks , hundreds in the N.L.D. 's upper echelons have been jailed . Its leader , Aung San Suu Kyi , is under house arrest , where she began a hunger strike on July 20 that reportedly ended just last week . <P> She is an improbable liberator for backward Burma , though perhaps born to the task . Her father was the national hero General Aung San , who led the struggle for independence from Britain only to be assassinated by a rival in July 1947 , a mere six months before colonial rule ended . Until just over a year ago , Suu Kyi lived in England with her British husband Michael Aris and her two sons . Her return to Burma in April 1988 was a matter of happenstance : she came home to nurse her mother , who died last January . But the explosive antigovernment protests that gripped Burma swept Suu Kyi , 44 , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clear , determined voice of opposition . Says a Rangoon lawyer : " She is the only person in our politics who is stainless . " <P> Her rise has been astonishing . As the daughter of Aung San , she was met with great deference , but her courage , bearing and oratory enabled her to build a following . The N.L.D. , which she helped found last year , has grown to some 2 million dues-paying members in a country of 40 million people . During electrifying tours of the countryside , she disregarded the army guns that menaced her and her followers . And she has routinely flouted martial-law regulations prohibiting gatherings of more than five people . At one rally in Rangoon , soldiers aimed automatic weapons at the crowd that gathered to listen to her . " We are grateful to those who are giving the people practice in being brave , " she snapped . While an officer recited over a loudspeaker the law prohibiting gatherings , Suu Kyi used her own microphone to confront the intruders : " May I request that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't have to .
