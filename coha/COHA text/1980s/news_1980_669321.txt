Of course , waiting for the evening news on CBS , NBC , or ABC has some advantages . Events that may be worth only a few seconds in the tightly trimmed evening newscasts may have taken up much more of a CNN viewers ' time during the day . They may have seen the same train derailment several times , though with new details each time. // But then immediacy is the name of the game with CNN even if the bit-by-bit approach to the news may leave viewers a somewhat confusing picture of the world by day ' s end. // Round the clock , nonstop , and mostly live , CNN is attempting to capture the kind of viewes that might like all-news radio stations . Now those followers of constant-flow news can see , not just hear , what ' s happening . And even if you are among the millions of Americans who do not have the time to sit and watch hours of TV , CNN offers constant updates of news. // CNN is a first  --  but it is also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being able to launch such a creature , Robert E. ( Ted ) Turner III , flamboyant owner of the Atlanta Braves and " superstation " WTBS ( a cable TV station that broadcasts via satellite nationwide ) , must now keep it alive. // The initial reaction to the concept has been positive from the people who are in the best position to determine the future of CNN  --  the cable companies that carry it to viewers across the country. // " I ' m very impressed  --  extremely impressed " says Andrew Goldman , vice-president of new services development for Tele-Prompter , the nation ' s largest cable system. // TelePrompter has some 1. 3 million subscribers , of which an initial 100 , 000 were offered CNN when it started broadcasting June 1. // " If they ( CNN ) maintain the quality they ' ve had the first week , I can sya emphatically we ' ll give more subscriber support , " says Mr. Goldman. // Cox Cable Communications Inc. , which offered about half of their subscribers the CNN station , is intially pleased . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark Handler , director of marketing for Cox . A number of subscribers have called in favorable reaction , too , he says. // What is this new approach to television journalism that is stirring such reactions ? // A visit to the utramodern studio at CNN headquarters here provides some of the answers . Program schedules , top executives and a day of off-and-on watching of CNN provide further answers : // **28;6039; It is a few minutes after 10 a. m . Senior news producer Ted Kavanau has just taken temporary charge of the nerve center of CNN an open control room with some 45 TV monitor screens and a panel of dozens of green , red , and white buttons and switches. <> **28;6069; // Sen. Edward Kennedy is just about to open a Senate hearing on the Love Canal . CNN is going to carry the hearing live  --  cutting into its other programs whenever the testimony gets interesting. // But first a piece on Nicaragua is run , a CNN original done with its own reporters and camera crews . " It would be very nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office by phone . Seconds after the fiveminute Nicaragua piece is finished , the CNN cameras cut to Senator Kennedy , then stay live with the remarks by a distraught man who lives near the chemical-Iaden canal . The man breaks down and cries. <> // **28;6099; " Good stuff , " several CNN executives say later , and scenes of the man crying are scheduled for reruns later in the day ' s news summaries <> . // CNN news headlines that hour include a murder-rape , a killer on the loose , terrorist bombing of the Statue of Liberty , an attack by Afghanistan rebels , and Nicaragua developments. // CNN news summaries are given hourly . The main newscasts are from noon to 2 p. m. and from 8 to 10 p. m. , with updates are given whenever needed. // " I counterprogrammed the whole thing , " CNN president Reese Schonfeld told the Monitor . " We ' re not strong enough to go head to head ( trying to match the evening newscasts of the three major networks ) . " // Headed by veteran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s reporters number about 20 . ( But some 30 television stations cooperate with CNN , providing coverage and using CNN material . ) The CNN reporters are located in Washington , New York , Chicago , Dallas , Atlanta , Los Angeles , and San Francisco in the US  --  and Rome and London overseas . A joint venture with Canadian Television Network Ltd. gives CNN Peking coverage . So while the networks with their much larger staffs are offering the evening news . CNN is giving sports and financial roundups. // Cox cable marketing director Handler approves of such an approach : " For many people , the national news is not really on at a very convenient time. " // " Within a 24-hour period we can be all things to all people , " Mr. Schonfeld predicts confidently . Viewers , he adds , are " going to tumble out of the trees. " // Or will they get bored ? If they do , it will not be for lack of variety. // Included among the many commentators , for example , are consumer advocate Ralph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s rights champion Bella Abzug , and national STOP ERA chairman Phyllis Schlafly. // But clearly CNN is not designed for the viewers who watches hour after hour . Nor is it likely that many viewers will even try to keep up with the information flowing out on a seemingly endless variety to topics. // " The average viewer may watch 15 minutes at a time. . . 1 1/2 hours a day , " suggests Doug David , CNN ' s director of marketing. // CNN began June 1 with about 2 million subscribers . It plans to double that by the end of the year . Mr. Schonfeld says the break-even point financially will be around 8 million to 10 million subscribers , a point that may , he says , be reached in about three years. // Until then , Ted Turner ' s money is the prop to keep CNN afloat . He has borrowed heavily to launch his all-news station. // Cable companies carrying CNN will pay CNN 15 to 20 cents per viewer . Other revenues will be from advertisers , with Bristol Meyers currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be charged for advertising . CNN plans to have 12 minutes of its ads and two minutes of ads by local carriers hourly. // One potential snag  --  getting the service to viewers . Currently , the programs are beamed via RCA Satcom 1 Satellite . When RCA ' s Satcom 3 satellite , which was to have carried CNN , was lost in space last December , the Federal Communications Commission ruled that RCA had to make space available on Satcom 1 , at least until Dec. 1 // Meanwhile , there is an air of excitement in the CNN studio here . Despite the deadline-every-minute nature of the work , there is a high degree of friendly cooperation among most staffers. // //
