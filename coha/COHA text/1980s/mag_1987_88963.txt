Sports fans value Athletes as little more than grown-ups ' toys , and what genuine affection we lavish on star athletes is largely reserved for those few precious idols whom we first worshiped when we were children . Perhaps our only closer relationship with great athletes comes later , when we begin to connect vicariously with those who happen to be the same age we are . It 's not only that we identify with these exalted contemporaries , but also that we expect them to carry the flag for our cohort as we march onward in the parade of life . // This is why those of us in the seats always want our athletes  --  the ones who are our age  --  to quit while they 're still on top . That way , they wo n't embarrass us . We then want our heroes to instantly disappear so that we can always remember them ( and ourselves ) as magnificent and forever green . For it is when our athletes start to go downhill that we are forced to come to grips with the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , we are all teased by Satan 's alluring notion that we should live fast , die young and leave a beautiful corpse . Clearly , the continuing fascination with Marilyn Monroe and James Dean  --  which seems limited to their contemporaries  --  derives from that grim fancy . Looking dreamily at photographs of Marilyn and Jimmy is even better than going to an old-timers ' game . Old-timers stumble and bumble ; they 're old-timers precisely because they 're old . // Gus Johnson will never achieve that estate . He died the other day at age 48. // Damn it , Gus , you had no right to do that . You were positively indestructible , more crammed with the substance of life than anybody I ever saw . More than that , though , you were supposed to be my escort through life , my guide-on through that cavalcade . // You see , Gus and I were almost exactly the same age . Johnson was born three days before I was , just before Christmas 1938 , under the benevolent sign of Sagittarius . Connie Francis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born not long before that and Jon Voight a couple of weeks afterward. // Famous people are born all the time , every week , as regularly as regular people . Gus and Connie were my week 's . Sometimes I 've visualized the three of us , walking arm in arm , like Dorothy ' tween the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman . But Connie has suffered all sorts of emotional problems , and Johnson , who was the last person in the world who could possibly die , is in the graveyard , dead . // I met Gus in 1963 , following his first NBA game . After covering the game for this magazine , I was in a room in the Baltimore Civic Center that had been set aside for season-ticket holders and the attendant insiders and swells . The Celtics had just annihilated the Bullets , but Gus came blowing in , all 6 ' 6 " of him , powerful and handsome , dressed to the nines , smoking a cigarette . He stepped up to the bar , opened his mouth to show where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tooth and , in that huge , booming voice of his , allowed as how he would appreciate a whiskey . The fine people of Baltimore looked on him with awe . I thought to myself , Hey , this guy might make ' em forget Connie Francis . I was born in an even better week than I 'd imagined . // Like a lot of us who arrived late in the Depression , Johnson played a good transition game with life . On the one hand , he was a throwback . He never took care of himself and , as a result , was often injured . He also did n't have agents to prevent him from spending all his money on the pursuit of good-looking women . But more than anyone else he was the prototype for the basketball player who strides the courts today . He jumped to the stars and , with a sweeping , tomahawk dunk , periodically obliterated backboards. // Yet , as flamboyant as he was , the simple community values of the team were never beneath him . " Gus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , " says Chicago Bulls general manager Jerry Krause , who , as a scout and rookie p.r . man , sometimes roomed with Johnson that first season in Baltimore . // After the competition , Gus was level and fair , gentle even . Maybe it helped that a knockout lady was surely awaiting him . But let 's not be superior  --  the excesses of the good life did n't do him in . Stupid old brain cancer decked Johnson . // The odds in life  --  fate  --  are dished out in lightning strikes and automobile accidents . The fragility of life can be ironic . It seems impossible that a body so magic , so potent , so unconquerable could have been cut down by something merely fickle within it . " Do n't worry about me , I 'm going to be O.K. , " Johnson reassured friends in the weeks before he died . " I 've made my peace . " // But his death has made me so fearful , so vulnerable . This was the man , bold and vital , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
