Too many cooks threaten to spoil the farm bill <P> " Before very long , we 're actually going to have to dig big holes and bury this stuff , " said Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng in Chicago , waving a piece of moldy cheese . " American taxpayers are spending almost $2 billion this year buying up dairy products nobody wants . " Lyng was referring to the most blatant and expensive byproduct of the nation 's complex array of agricultural support programs : the 12.6 billion Ibs. of surplus milk produce that the Government has purchased ( at a cost of $1.9 billion ) to help stabilize dairy prices . <P> Despite its anxiety about out-of-control deficits , the Administration has fought with less than total zeal for a farm bill that would cut back on agricultural subsidies , which cost the taxpayers about $3 billion in the past fiscal year . The reason , as usual , is politics : the White House agreed to continue supporting certain commodities in exchange for needed votes on its tax and budget bills . Complained Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to end tobacco protection : " Instead of democracy in action , we had hypocrisy in action . " <P> Shamansky has a point . The Senate passed a farm bill that would hold the line on future subsidies for grain and dairy products but allow additional protections for sugar and peanuts . The House last week passed by a 192-to-160 vote a totally different bill that would increase dairy and grain subsidies but would eliminate protection for sugar and peanuts . The Senate bill would cost at least $7 billion over the next four years ; the House bill would cost $13 billion . The only ones totally pleased with the bills were Southern tobacco planters . Their peculiar allotment system remained untouched in both versions , and presumably will survive this week 's negotiations to reconcile the measures . <P> After much debate last month , the Senate voted to let the milk price supports drop from close to 80% to below 70% of parity , which is defined as the relative buying power that farm commodities had from 1910 to 1914 . But the dairy lobby , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispensed more than $1 million in contributions in the past two elections to the Congressmen who voted its way , outmaneuvered Administration supporters in the House . Vermont Republican James Jeffords countered a bipartisan proposal to pare dairy supports to the Senate levels by offering an amendment that would increase subsidies by $2.5 billion over four years . As battle lines were being drawn , Iowa Democrat Berkley Bedell introduced a " compromise " proposal , backed by the dairy industry , that would raise supports by only $400 million over the Senate version . His plan won the day .
