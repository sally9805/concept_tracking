God , Shug Avery sick and nobody in this town want to take the Queen Honeybee in . Her mammy say She told her so . Her pappy say , Tramp . A woman at church say she dying  --  maybe two berkulosis or some kind of nasty woman disease . What ? I want to ast , but do n't . The women at church sometime nice to me . Sometime not . They look at me there struggling with Mr. children . Trying to drag ' em to the church , trying to keep'em quiet after us get there . They some of the same ones used to be here both times I was big . Sometimes they think I do n't notice , they stare at me . Puzzle . I keep my head up , best I can . I do a right smart for the preacher . Clean the floor and windows , make the wine , wash the altar linen . Make sure there 's wood for the stove in wintertime . He call me Sister Celie . Sister Celie , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he talk to the other ladies and they mens . I scurry bout , doing this , doing that . Mr. sit back by the door gazing here and there . The womens smile in his direction every chance they git . He never look at me or even notice . Even the preacher got his mouth on Shug Avery , now she down . He take her condition for his text . He do n't call no name , but he do n't have to . Everybody know who he mean . He talk bout a strumpet in short skirts , smoking cigarettes , drinking gin . Singing for money and taking other women mens . Talk bout slut , hussy , heifer and streetcleaner . I cut my eyes back at Mr. when he say that . Streetcleaner . Somebody got to stand up for Shug , I think . But he do n't say nothing . He cross his legs first to one side , then to40the other . He gaze out the window . The same women smile at him , say amen gainst Shug . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes . He call down to Harpo and Sofia house . Harpo come running . Hitch up the wagon , he say .

One good thing bout the way he never do any work round the place , us never miss him when he gone . Five days later I look way off up the road and see the wagon coming back . It got sort of a canopy over it now , made.out of old blankets or something . My heart begin to beat like furry , and the first thing I try to do is change my dress . But too late for that . By time I git my head and arm out the old dress , I see the wagon pull up in the yard .

I come to the door . Yessir ? I ast , and trip over the broom I was sweeping with when I first notice the wagon . Harpo and Sofia in the yard now , looking inside the wagon . They faces grim . Who this ? Harpo ast . The woman should have been your mammy , he say . Shug Avery ? Harpo ast . He look up at me . Help me git her in the house , Mr. say .

Close up I see all this yellow powder caked up on her face . Red rouge . She look like she ai n't long for this world but dressed well for the next . But I know better . Come on in , I want to cry . To shout . Come on in . With God help , Celie going to make you well . But I do n't say nothing . It not my house . Also I ai n't been told nothing .

Under all that powder her face black as Harpo . She got a long pointed nose and big fleshy mouth . Lips look like black plum . Eyes big , glossy . Feverish . And mean .

She look at him and roll her eyes and laugh . It not much of a laugh but it keep him away from the bed . He sit over in the corner away from the lamp . Sometime she wake up in the night and do n't even see . But he there . Sitting in the shadows chewing on his pipe . No tobacco in it .

He do n't answer . He keep working , doing every thing with Swain. 62Dear God , The first week , nobody come . Second week , three or four . Third week , one . Harpo sit behind his little counter listening to Swain pick his box . He got cold drinks , he got barbecue , he got chitlins , got store bought bread . He got a sign saying Harpo 's tacked up on the side of the house and another one out on the road . But he ai n't got no customers . I go down the path to the yard , stand outside , look in . Harpo look out and wave . Come on in , Miss Celie , he say . I say , Naw thank you . Mr. sometime walk down , have a cold drink , listen to Swain . Miss Shug walk down too , every once in a while . She still wearing her little shifts , and I still cornrow her hair , but it getting long now and she say soon she want it press . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever come to mind , forgit about polite . Sometime I see him staring at her real hard when he do n't think I 'm looking . One day he say , Nobody coming way out here just to hear Swain . Wonder could I get the Queen Honeybee ? I do n't know , I said . She a lot better now , always humming or singing something . She probably be glad to git back to work . Why do n't you ask her ? Shug say his place not much compared to what she used to , but she think maybe she might grace it with a song . Harpo and Swain got Mr. to give ' em some of Shugold announcements from out the trunk . Crossed out The LuckyStar of Coalman Road , put in Harpo 's of plantation. 63Stuck ' em on trees tween the turn off to our road and town . The first Saturday night so many folks come they could n't git in . Shug , Shug baby , us thought you was dead . Five out of a dozen say hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was you , Shug say with a big grin . At last I git to see Shug Avery work . I git to watch her . I git to hear her . Mr. did n't want me to come . Wives do n't go toplaces like that , he say . Yeah , but Celie going , say Shug , while I press her hair . Spose I git sick while I 'm singing , she say . Spose my dress come undone ? She wearing a skintight red dress look like the straps made out of two pieces of thread . Mr. mutter , putting on his clothes . My wife ca n't dothis . My wife ca n't do that . No wife of mines . . . He go on and on . Shug Avery finally say , Good thing I ai n't your damn wife . He hush then . All three of us go down to Harpo 's . Mr. and me sit at the same table . Mr. drink whiskey . Ihave a cold drink . First Shug sing a song by somebody name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old friend . It call A Good Man Is Hard to Find . She look over at Mr. a little whenshe sing that . I look over at him too . For such a little man , he all puff up . Look like all he can do to stay in his chair . I look at Shug and I feel my heart begin to cramp . It hurt me so , I cover it with my hand . I think I might as well be under the table , for all they care . I hate the way I look , I hate the way I 'm dress . Nothing butchurchgoing clothes in my chifferobe . And Mr. looking at Shug 's bright black skin in her tight red dress , her feet in little sassy red shoes . Her hair shining in waves . Before I know it , tears meet under my chin . And I 'm confuse . He love looking at Shug . I love looking at Shug . But Shug do n't love looking at but one of us . Him . But that the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that so , why my heart hurt me so ? My head droop so it near bout in my glass. 64Then I hear my name . Shug saying Celie . Miss Celie . And I look up where she at . She say my name again . She say this song I 'm bout to sing is call Miss Celie 's song . Cause she scratched it out of my head when I was sick . First she hum it a little , like she do at home . Then she sing the words . It all about some no count man doing her wrong , again . But I do n't listen to that part . I look at her and I hum along a little with the tune . First time somebody made something and name it after me. 65Dear God , Pretty soon it be time for Shug to go . She sing every week-end now at Harpo 's . He make right smart money off of her , and she make some too . Plus she gitting strong again and stout . First night or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now she belt them out . Folks out in the yard hear her with no trouble . She and Swain sound real good together . She sing , he pick his box . It nice at Harpo 's . Little tables all round the room with candles on them that I made , lot of little tables outside too , by the creek . Sometime I look down the path from our house and it look like a swarm of lightening bugs all in and through Sofia house . In the evening Shug ca n't wait to go down there . One day she say to me , Well , Miss Celie , I believe it time for me to go . When ? I ast . Early next month , she say . June . June a good time to go off into the world . I do n't say nothing . Feel like I felt when Nettie left . She come over and put her hand on my shoulder . He beat me when you not here , I say . Who do , she say , Albert ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she say . She sit down on the bench next to me real hard , like she drop . What he beat you for ? she ast . For being me and not you . Oh , Miss Celie , she say , and put her arms around me. 66Us sit like that for maybe half a hour . Then she kiss me on the fleshy part of my shoulder and stand up . I wo n't leave , she say , until I know Albert wo n't even think about beating you. 67Dear God , Now we all know she going sometime soon , they sleep together at night . Not every night , but almost every night , from Friday to Monday . He go down to Harpo 's to watch her sing . And just to look at her . Then way late they come home . They giggle and they talk and they rassle until morning . Then they go to bed until it time for her to get ready to go back to work . First time it happen , it was a accident . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He do n't say nothing . She ast me , Tell me the truth , she say , do you mind if Albert sleep with me ? I think , I do n't care who Albert sleep with . But I do n't say that . I say , You might git big again . She say , Naw , not with my sponge and all . You still love him , I ast . She say , I got what you call a passion for him . If I was ever going to have a husband he 'd a been it . But he weak , she say . Ca n't make up his mind what he want . And from what you tell me he a bully . Some things I love about him though , she say . He smell right to me . He so little . He make me laugh . You like to sleep with him ? I ast . Yeah , Celie , she say , I have to confess , I just love it . Do n't you ? Naw , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it at all . What is it to like ? He git up on you , heist your nightgown round your waist , plunge in . Most times I pretend I ai n't there . He never know the difference . Never ast me how I feel , nothing . Just do his business , get off , go to sleep. 68She start to laugh . Do his business , she say . Do his business . Why , Miss Celie . You make it sound like he going to the toilet on you . That what it feel like , I say . She stop laughing . You never enjoy it at all ? she ast , puzzle . Not even with your children daddy ? Never , I say . Why Miss Celie , she say , you still a virgin . What ? I ast . Listen , she say , right down there in your pussy is a little button that gits real hot when you do you know what with somebody . It git hotter and hotter and then it melt . That the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lot of sucking go on , here and there , she say . Lot of finger and tongue work . Button ? Finger and tongue ? My face hot enough to melt itself . She say , Here , take this mirror and go look at yourself down there , I bet you never seen it , have you ? Naw . And I bet you never seen Albert down there either . I felt him , I say . I stand there with the mirror . She say , What , too shame even to go off and look at yourself ? And you look so cute too , she say , laughing . All dressed up for Harpo 's , smelling good and everything , but scared to look at your own pussy . You come with me while I look , I say . And us run off to my room like two little prankish girls . You guard the door , I say . She giggle . Okay , she say . Nobody coming . Coast clear . I lie back on the bed and haul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the looking glass tween my legs . Ugh . All that hair . Then my pussy lips be black . Then inside look like a wet rose . It a lot prettier than you thought , ai n't it ? she say from the door. 69It mine , I say . Where the button ? Right up near the top , she say . The part that stick out a little . I look at her and touch it with my finger . A little shiver go through me . Nothing much . But just enough to tell me this the right button to mash . Maybe . She say , While you looking , look at your titties too . I haul up my dress and look at my titties . Think bout my babies sucking them . Remember the little shiver I felt then too . Sometimes a big shiver . Best part about having the babies was feeding ' em . Albert and Harpo coming , she say . And I yank up my drawers and yank down my dress . I feel like us been doing something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , I say . And she take me at my word . I take me at my word too . But when I hear them together all I can do is pull the quilt over my head and finger my little button and titties and cry. 70Dear God , One night while Shug singing a hot one , who should come prancing through the door of Harpo 's but Sofia . She with a big tall hefty man look like a prize fighter . She her usual stout and bouncy self . Oh , Miss Celie , she cry . It so good to see you again . It even good to see Mr. , she say .

Shug say , Girl , you look like a good time , you do . That when I notice how Shug talk and act sometimes like a man . Men say stuff like that to women , Girl , you look like a good time . Women always talk bout hair and health . How many babies living or dead , or got teef . Not bout how some woman they hugging on look like a good time .

Harpo still holding Sofia arm . Maybe half a minute go by . Finally he turn loose her arm , reach down and cradle poor little Squeak in his arms . He coo and coo at her like she a baby . Sofia come over and git the prizefighter . They go out the door and do n't look back . Then us hear a car motor start. 74Dear God , Harpo mope .

Sofia never notice , she as deef to the little girl as she is to her brother . Miss Millie cut her eyes at her , put one arm round Billy shoulder and they limp into the back of the house . Little girl follow , wave bye-bye to us . She seem like a right sweet little thing , I say to Sofia . Who is ? She frown . The little girl , I say . What they call her , Eleanor Jane ? Yeah , say Sofia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder why she was ever born . Well , I say , us do n't have to wonder that bout darkies . She giggle . Miss Celie , she say , you just as crazy as you can be . This the first giggle I heard in three years . Dear God , Sofia would make a dog laugh , talking about those people she work for . They have the nerve to try to make us think slavery fell through because of us , say Sofia . Like us did n't have sense enough to handle it . All the time breaking hoe handles and letting the mules loose in the wheat . But how anything they build can last a day is a wonder to me . They backward , she say . Clumsy , and unlucky . Mayor bought Miz Millie a new car , cause she said if colored could have cars then one for her was past due . So he bought her a car , only he refuse to show her how to drive it . Every day he come home from town he look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say , How you enjoying ' er Miz Millie . She fly off the sofa in a huff , slam the door going in the bathroom . She ai n't got no friends . So one day she say to me , car been sitting out in the yard two months , Sofia , do you know how to drive ? I guess she remembered first seeing me up gainst Buster Broadnax car . Yes ma'am , I say . I 'm slaving away cleaning that big post they got down at the bottom of the stair . They act real funny bout that post . No finger prints is sposed to be on it , ever . Do you think you could teach me ? she says . One of Sofia children break in , the oldest boy . He tall and handsome , all the time serious . And mad a lot . He say , Do n't say slaving , Mama . Sofia say , Why not ? They got me in a little storeroom up under the house , hardly bigger than Odessa 's porch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm at they beck and call all night and all day . They wo n't let me see my children . They wo n't let Me see no mens . Well , after five years they let me see88 89you once a year . I 'm a slave , she say . What would you call it ? A captive , he say . Sofia go on with her story , only look at him like she glad he hers . So I say , Yes ma'am . I can teach you , if it the same kind of car I learned on . Next thing you know there go me and Miz Millie all up and down the road . First I drive and she watch , then she start to try to drive and I watch her . Up and down the road . Soon as I finish cooking breakfast , putting it on the table , washing dishes and sweeping the floor  --  and just before I go git the mail out of the box down by the road  --  we go give Miz Millie her driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , more or less . Then she really git it . Then one day when we come home from riding , she say to me , I 'm gon na drive you home . Just like that . Home ? I ast . Yes , she say . Home . You ai n't been home or seen your children in a while , she say . Ai n't that right ? I say , Yes ma'am . It been five years . She say , That 's a shame . You just go git your things right now . Here it is , Christmas . Go get your things . You can stay all day . For all day I do n't need nothing but what I got on , I say . Fine , she say . Fine . Well git in . Well , say Sofia , I was so use to sitting up there next to her teaching her how to drive , that I just naturally clammed into the front seat . She stood outside on her side the car clearing her throat . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the South . Yes ma'am , I say . She clear her throat , laugh some more . Look where you sitting , she say . I 'm sitting where I always sit , I say . That 's the problem , she say . Have you ever seen a whiteperson and a colored sitting side by side in a car , when one of'em was n't showing the other one how to drive it or clean it ? I got out the car , opened the back door and clammed in . She90sat down up front . Off us traveled down the road , Miz Millie hair blowing all out the window . It 's real pretty country out this way , she say , when we hit the Marshall county road , coming toward Odessa 's house . Yes ma'am , I say . Then us pull into the yard and all the children come crowding round the car . Nobody told them I was coming , so they do n't know who I is . Except the oldest two . They fall on me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hug me too . I do n't think they even notice I was sitting in the back of the car . Odessa and Jack come out after I was out , so they did n't see it . Us all stand round kissing and hugging each other , Miz Millie just watching . Finally , she lean out the window and say , Sofia , you only got the rest of the day . I 'll be back to pick you up at five o'clock . The children was all pulling me into the house , so sort of over my shoulder I say , Yes ma'am , and I thought I heard her drive off . But fifteen minutes later , Marion says , That white lady still out there . Maybe she going to wait to take you back , say Jack . Maybe she sick , say Odessa . You always say how sickly they is . I go out to the car , say Sofia , and guess what the matter is ? The matter is , she do n't know how to do nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of trees for that . Sofia , she say , How you back this thing up ? I lean over the car window and try to show her which way to move the gears . But she flustered and all the children and Odessa and Jack all standing round the porch watching her . I go round on the other side . Try to explain with my head poked through that window . She stripping gears aplenty by now . Plus her nose red and she look mad and frustrate both . I clam in the back seat , lean over the back of the front , steady trying to show her how to operate the gears . Nothing happen . Finally the car stop making any sound . Engine dead . Do n't worry , I say , Odessa 's husband jack will drive you home . That 's his pick-up right there. 91Oh , she say , I could n't ride in a pick-up with a strange colored man . I 'll ask Odessa to squeeze in too , I say . That would give me a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . But she say , No , I do n't know her neither . So it end up with me and jack driving her back home in the pick-up , then jack driving me to town to git a mechanic , and at five o'clock I was driving Miz Millie 's car back to her house . I spent fifteen minutes with my children . And she been going on for months bout how ungrateful I is . White folks is a miracle of affliction , say Sofia. 92Dear God , Shug write she got a big surprise , and she intend to bring it home for Christmas . What it is ? us wonder . Mr. think it a car for him . Shug making big moneynow , dress in furs all the time . Silk and satin too , and hats made out of gold . Christmas morning us hear this motor outside the door .

Then I do n't hear nothing . I run out the door . Shug , I say , and put out my arms . But before I know anything a skinny big toof man wearing red suspenders is all up in my face . Fore I can wonder whose dog he is , he hugging me . Miss Celie , he say . Aw , Miss Celie . I heard so much about you . Feel like we old friends . Shug standing back with a big grin .

I know I do n't look no better . And this my wedding present to us , say Shug . The car big and dark blue and say Packard on the front . Brand new , she say . She look at Mr. , take his arm , give it a little squeeze . While we here , Albert , she say , I want you to learn how to drive . She laugh . Grady drive like a fool , she say .

Anyhow , once you told me he beat you , and wo n't work , I felt different about him . If you was my wife , she say , I 'd cover you up with kisses stead of licks , and work hard for you too .

He try to play with the button but feel like his fingers dry . Us don : ' t git nowhere much . You still a virgin ? she ast . I reckon . I say. 95Dear God , Mr. and Grady gone off in the car together . Shug ast me could she sleep with me . She cold in her and Grady bed all alone . Us talk bout this and that . Soon talk bout making love . Shug do n't actually say making love . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , How was it with your children daddy ? The girls had a little separate room , I say , off to itself , connected to the house by a little plank walk . Nobody ever come in there but Mama . But one time when mama not at home , he come . Told me he want me to trim his hair . He bring the scissors and comb and brush and a stool . While I trim his hair he look at me funny . He a little nervous too , but I do n't know why , till he grab hold of me and cram me up tween his legs . I lay there quiet , listening to Shug breathe . It hurt me , you know , I say . I was just going on fourteen . I never even thought bout men having nothing down there so big . It scare me just to see it . And the way it poke itself and grow . Shug so quiet I think she sleep . After he through , I say , he make me finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , Miss Celie , she say . And put her arms round me . They black and smooth and kind of glowy from the lamplight . I start to cry too . I cry and cry and cry . Seem like it all come back to me , laying there in Shug arms . How it hurt and how much I was surprise . How it stung while I finish trimming his hair . How the blood drip down my leg and mess up my96stocking . How he do n't never look at me straight after that . And Nettie . Do n't cry , Celie , Shug say . Do n't cry . She start kissing the water as it come down side my face . After while I say , Mama finally ast how come she find his hair in the girls room if he do n't never go in there like he say . That when he told her I had a boyfriend . Some boy he say he seen sneaking out the back door . It the boy 's hair , he say , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , he say . I did love to cut hair , I say to Shug , since I was a little bitty thing . I 'd run go git the scissors if I saw hair coming , and I 'd cut and cut , long as I could . That how come I was the one cut his hair . But always before I cut it on the front porch . It got to the place where everytime I saw him coming with the scissors and the comb and the stool , I start to cry . Shug say , Wellsah , and I thought it was only whitefolks do freakish things like that . My mama die , I tell Shug . My sister Nettie run away . Mr. come git me to take care his rotten children . He never ast me nothing bout myself . He clam on top of me and fuck and fuck , even when my head bandaged . Nobody ever love me , I say . She say , I love you , Miss Celie . And then she haul off and kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like she surprise . I kiss her back , say , urn , too . Us kiss and kiss till us ca n't hardly kiss no more . Then us touch each other . I do n't know nothing bout it , I say to Shug . I do n't know much , she say . Then I feels something real soft and wet on my breast , feel like one of my little lost babies mouth . Way after while , I act like a little lost baby too. 97Dear God , Grady and Mr. come staggering in round daybreak . Me and Shug sound asleep . Her back to me , my arms round her waist . What it like ? Little like sleeping with mama , only I ca n't hardly remember ever sleeping with her . Little like sleeping with Nettie , only sleeping with Nettie never feel this good . It warm and cushiony , and I feel Shug 's big tits sorta flop over my arms like suds . It feel like heaven is what it feel like , not likesleeping with Mr. at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Shug roll over , hug me , and git out of the bed . She stagger into the other room and fall on the bed with Grady . Mr. fall into bed next to me , drunk , and snoring before he hit the quilts . I try my best to like Grady , even if he do wear red suspenders and bow ties . Even if he do spend Shug 's money like he made it himself . Even if he do try to talk like somebody from the North . Memphis , Tennessee ai n't North , even I know that . But one thing I sure nuff ca n't stand , the way he call Shug Mama . I ai n't your fucking mama , Shug say . But he do n't pay her no mind . Like when he be making goo-goo eyes at Squeak and Shug sorta tease him about it , he say , Aw , Mama , you know I do n't mean no harm . Shug like Squeak too , try to help her sing . They sit in Odessa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and singing . Sometime Swain come with his box , Harpo cook dinner , and me and Mr. and the prizefighter bringour preshation. 98It nice . Shug say to Squeak , I mean , Mary Agnes , You ought to sing in public . Mary Agnes say , Naw . She think cause she do n't sing big and broad like Shug nobody want to hear her . But Shug say she wrong . What about all them funny voices you hear singing in church ? Shug say . What about all them sounds that sound good but they not the sounds you thought folks could make ? What bout that ? Then she start moaning . Sound like death approaching , angels ca n't prevent it . It raise the hair on the back of your neck . But it really sound sort of like panthers would sound if they could sing . I tell you something else , Shug say to Mary Agnes , listening to you sing , folks git to thinking bout a good screw . Aw , Miss Shug , say Mary Agnes , changing color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing and dancingand fucking together ? She laugh . That 's the reason they call what us sing the devil 's music . Devils love to fuck . Listen , she say , Let 's go sing one night at Harpo place . Be like old times for me . And if I bring you before the crowd , they better listen with respect . Niggers do n't know how to act , but if you git through the first half of one song , you got ' em . You reckon that 's the truth ? say Mary Agnes . She all big eyed and delight . I do n't know if I want her to sing , say Harpo . How come ? ast Shug . That woman you got singing now ca n't git her ass out the church . Folks do n't know whether to dance or creep to the mourner 's bench . Plus , you dress Mary Agnes up the right way and you 'll make piss pots of money . Yellow like she is , stringy hair and cloudy eyes , the men 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grady , she say . Grady look little sheepish . Grin . Mama you do n't miss a thing , he say . And do n't you forgit it , say Shug. 99Dear God , This the letter I been holding in my hand . Dear Celie , I know you think I am dead . But I am not . I been writing to you too , over the years , but Albert said you 'd never hear from me again and since I never heard from you all this time , I guess he was right . Now I only write at Christmas and Easter hoping my letter get lost among the Christmas and Easter greetings , or that Albert get the holiday spirit and have pity on us . There is so much to tell you that I do n't know , hardly , where to begin  --  and anyway , you probably wo n't get this letter , either . I 'm sure Albert is still the only one to take mail out of the box . But if this do get through , one thing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not dead . And Olivia is fine and so is your son . We are all coming home before the end of another year . Your loving sister , NettieOne night in bed Shug ast me to tell her bout Nettie . What she like ? Where she at ? I tell her how Mr. try to turn her head . How Nettieref use him , and how he say Nettie have to go . Where she go ? she ast . I do n't know , I say . She leave here . And no word from her yet ? she ast . Naw , 1 say . Every day when Mr. come from theioomailbox I hope for news . But nothing come . She dead , I say . Shug say , She would n't be someplace with funny stamps , you do n't reckon ? She look like she studying . Say , Sometimes when Albert and me walk up to the mailbox there be a letter with a lot of funny looking stamps . He never say nothing bout it , just put it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I look at the stamps but he said he 'd take it out later . But he never did . She was just on her way to town , I say . Stamps look like stamps round here . White men with long hair . Hm , she say , look like a little fat white woman was on one . What your sister Nettie like ? she ast . Smart ? Yes , Lord , I say . Smart as anything . Read the newspapers when she was little more than talking . Did figures like they was nothing . Talked real well too . And sweet . There never was a sweeter girl , I say . Eyes just brimming over with it . She love me too , I say to Shug . She tall or short ? Shug ast . What kind of dress she like to wear ? What her birthday ? What her favorite color ? Can she cook ? Sew ? What about hair ? Everything bout Nettie she want to know . I talk so much my voice start to go . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ast . Cause she the only one you ever love , she say , sides me. 101Dear God , All of a sudden Shug buddy-buddy again with Mr. They sit on the steps , go down Harpo 's . Walk to the mailbox . Shug laugh and laugh when he got anything to say . Show teef and fits aplenty . Me and Grady try to carry on like us civilize . But it hard . When I hear Shug laugh I want to choke her , slap Mr. face . All this week I suffer . Grady and me feel so down he turn to reefer , I turn to prayer . Saturday morning Shug put Nettie letter in my lap . Little fat queen of England stamps on it , plus stamps that got peanuts , coconuts , rubber trees and say Africa . I do n't know where England at . Do n't know where Africa at either . So I still do n't know where Nettie at . He been keeping your letters , say Shug . Naw , I say . Mr. mean sometimes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mean . But how come he to do it ? I ast . He know Nettie mean everything in the world to me . Shug say she do n't know , but us gon find out . Us seal the letter up again and put it back in Mr. pocket . I le walk round with it in his coat all day . He never mention it . Just talk and laugh with Grady , Harpo and Swain , and try to learn how to drive Shug car . I watch him so close , I begin to feel a lightening in the head . Fore I know anything I 'm standing hind his chair with his razor open. 102Then I hear Shug laugh , like something just too funny . She say to me , I know I told you I need something to cut this hangnail with , but Albert git real niggerish bout his razor . Mr. look behind him . Put that down , he say . Women , always needing to cut this and shave that , and always gumming up the razor . Shug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Oh it look dull anyway . She take and sling it back in the shaving box . All day long I act just like Sofia . I stutter . I mutter to myself . I stumble bout the house crazy for Mr. blood . In my mind , he falling dead every which a way . By time night come , I ca n't speak . Every time I open my mouth nothing come come out but a little burp . Shug tell everybody I got a fever and she put me to bed . It probably catching , she say to Mr. . Maybe you bettersleep somewhere else . But she stay with me all night long . I do n't sleep . I do n't cry . I do n't do nothing . I 'm cold too . Pretty soon I think maybe I 'm dead . Shug hold me close to her and sometimes talk . One thing my mama hated me for was how much I love to fuck , she say . She never love to do nothing had anything to do with touching nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she turn her mouth away . Say , Cut that out Lillie , she say . Lillie Shug 's real name . She just so sweet they call her Shug . My daddy love me to kiss and hug him , but she did n't like the looks of that . So when I met Albert , and once I got in his arms , nothing could git me out . It was good , too , she say . You know for me to have three babies by Albert and Albert weak as he is , it had to be good . I had every one of my babies at home , too . Midwife come , preacher come , a bunch of the good ladies from the church . Just when I hurt so much I do n't know my own name , they think a good time to talk bout repent . She laugh . I was too big a fool to repent . Then she say , I loved me some Albert I do n't even want to say nothing . Where I 'm at it peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing . Shug say , the last baby did it . They turned me out . I went to103stay with my mama wild sister in Memphis . She just like me , Mama say . She drink , she fight , she love mens to death . She work in a roadhouse . Cook . Feed fifty men , screw fifty-five . Shug talk and talk . And dance , she say . Nobody dance like Albert when he was young . Sometime us did the moochie for a hour . After that , nothing to do but go somewhere and lay down . And funny . Albert was so funny . He kept me laughing . How come he ai n't funny no more ? she ast . How come he never hardly laugh ? How come he do n't dance ? she . say . Good God , Celie , she say , What happen to the man I love ? She quiet a little while . Then she say , I was so surprise when I heard he was going to marry Annie Julia , she say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it . After all , Albert knew as well as me that love would have to go some to be better than ours . Us had the kind of love could n't be improve . That 's what I thought . But , he weak , she say . His daddy told him I 'm trash , my mama trash before me . His brother say the same . Albert try to stand up for us , git knock down . One reason they give him for not marrying me is cause I have children . But they his , I told old Mr. How us know ? He ast . Poor Annie Julia , Shug say . She never had a chance . I was so mean , and so wild , Lord . I used to go round saying , I do n't care who he married to , I 'm gon na fuck him . She stop talking a minute . Then she say , And I did , too . Us fuck so much in the open us give fucking a bad name . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have nothing , not even a liking for him . Her family forgot about her once she married . And then Harpo and all the children start to come . Finally she start to sleep with that man that shot her down . Albert beat her . The children dragged on her . Sometimes I wonder what she thought about while she died . I know what I 'm thinking bout , I think . Nothing . And as much of it as I can . I went to school with Annie Julia , Shug say . She was pretty , man . Black as anything , and skin just as smooth . Big black eyes104look like moons . And sweet too . Hell , say Shug , I liked her myself . Why I hurt her so ? I used to keep Albert away from home for a week at the time . She 'd come and beg him for money to buy groceries for the children . I feel a few drops of water on my hand . And when I come here , say Shug . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant . And all because Albert married you . And I did n't even want him for a husband , she say . I never really wanted Albert for a husband . But just to choose me , you know , cause nature had already done it . Nature said , You two folks , hook up , cause you a good example of how it sposed to go . I did n't want nothing to be able to go against that . But what was good tween us must have been nothing but bodies , she say . Cause I do n't know the Albert that do n't dance , ca n't hardly laugh , never talk bout nothing , beat you and hid your sister Nettie 's letters . Who he ? I do n't know nothing , I think . And glad of it . Dear God , Now that I know Albert hiding Nettie 's letters , I know exactly where they is . They in his trunk . Everything that mean something to Albert go in his trunk . He keep it locked up tight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. and Grady gone , us open the trunk . Us find a lot of Shug 's underclothes , some nasty picture postcards , and way down under his tobacco , Nettie 's letters . Bunches and bunches of them . Some fat , some thin . Some open , some not . How us gon do this ? I ast Shug . She say , Simple . We take the letters out of the envelopes , leave the envelopes just like they is . I do n't think he look in this corner of the trunk much , she say . I heated the stove , put on the kettle . Us steam and steam the envelopes until we had all the letters laying on the table . Then us put the envelopes back inside the trunk . I 'm gon na put them in some kind of order for you , say Shug . Yeah , I say , but do n't let 's do it in here , let 's go in you and Grady room . So she got up and us went into they little room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Nettie letters spread round her , I got on the bed with the pillows behind my back . These the first ones , say Shug . They postmark right here. io6Dear Celie , the first letter say , You 've got to fight and get away from Albert . He ai n't no good . When I left you all 's house , walking , he followed me on his horse . When we was well out of sight of the house he caught up with me and started trying to talk . You know how he do , You sure is looking fine , Miss Nettie , and stuff like that . I tried to ignore him and walk faster , but my bundles was heavy and the sun was hot . After while I had to rest , and that 's when he got down from his horse and started to try to kiss me , and drag me back in the woods . Well , I started to fight him , and with God 's help , I hurt him bad enough to make him let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of what I 'd done I 'd never hear from you again , and you would never hear from me . I was so mad myself I was shaking . Anyhow , I got a ride into town on somebody 's wagon . And that same somebody pointed me in the direction of the ReverendMr. ' s place . And what was my surprise when a little girl opened the door and she had your eyes set in your face. love , Nettie107Next one said , Dear Celie , I keep thinking it 's too soon to look for a letter from you . And I know how busy you is with all Mr. ' s children . But I miss you so much . Please write to me , soon as you have a chance . Every day I think about you . Every minute . The lady you met in town is name Corrine . The little girl 's name is Olivia . The husband 's name is Samuel . The little boy 's name is Adam . They are sanctified religious and very good to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Samuel preaches , and we spend a lot of time on church business . I say " we " because they always try to include me in everything they do , so I do n't feel so left out and alone . But God , I miss you , Celie . I think about the time you laid yourself down for me . I love you with all my heart , Your sister , Nettieio8Next one say , Dearest Celie , By now I am almost crazy . I think Albert told me the truth , and that he is not giving you my letters . The only person I can think of who could help us out is Pa , but I do n't want him to know where I am . I asked Samuel if he would visit you and Mr. , just to see how you are . But he says he ca n't risk putting himself between man and wife , especially when he do n't know them . And I felt bad for having to ask him , he and Corrine have been so nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is breaking because I can not find any work in this town , and I will have to leave . After I leave , what will happen to us ? How will we ever know what is going on ? Corrine and Samuel and the children are part of a group of people called Missionaries , of the American and African MissionarySociety . They have ministered to the Indians out west and are ministering to the poor of this town . All in preparation for the work they feel they were born for , missionary work in Africa . I dread parting from them because in the short time we 've been together they 've been like family to me . Like family might have been , I mean . Write if you can . Here are some stamps. love , Nettie109Next one , fat , dated two months later , say , Dear Celie , I wrote a letter to you almost every day on the ship coming to Africa . But by the time we docked I was so down , I tore them into little pieces and dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you have my letters and so what use is there in writing them . That 's the way I felt when I tore them up and sent them to you on the waves . But now I feel different . I remember one time you said your life made you feel so ashamed you could n't even talk about it to God , you had to write it , bad as you thought your writing was . Well , now I know what you meant . And whether God will read letters or no , I know you will go on writing them ; which is guidance enough for me . Anyway , when I do n't write to you I feel as bad as I do when I do n't pray , locked up in myself and choking on my own heart . I am so lonely , Celie . The reason I am in Africa is because one of the missionaries that was supposed to go with Corrine and Samuel to help with the children and with setting up a school suddenly married a man who was afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa with her . So there they were , all set to go , with a ticket suddenly available and no missionary to give it to . At the same time , I was n't able to find a job anywhere around town . But I never dreamed of going to Africa ! I never even thought about it as a real place , though Samuel and Corrine and even the children talked about it all the time. 110Miss Beasley used to say it was a place overrun with savages who did n't wear clothes . Even Corrine and Samuel thought like this at times . But they know a lot more about it than Miss Beasley or any of our other teachers , and besides , they spoke of all the good things they could do for the downtrodden people from whom they sprang . People who need Christ and good medical advice. 0 - le day I was in town with Corrine and we saw the mayor 's wife and her maid . The mayor 's wife was shopping  --  going in and out of stores  --  and her maid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packages . I do n't know if you have ever seen the mayor 's wife . She looks like a wet cat . And there was her maid looking like the very last person in the world you 'd expect to see waiting on anybody , and in particular not on anybody that looked like that . I spoke . But just speaking to me seemed to make her embarrassed and she suddenly sort of erased herself . It was the strangest thing , Celie ! One minute I was saying howdy to a living woman . The next minute nothing living was there . Only its shape . All that night I thought about it . Then Samuel and Corrine told me what they 'd heard about how she got to be the mayor 's maid . That she attacked the mayor , and then the mayor and his wife took her from the prison to work in their home . In the morning I started asking questions about Africa and started reading all the books Samuel and Corrine have on the subject . Did you know there were great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thousands of years ago ? That the Egyptians who built the pyramids and enslaved the Israelites were colored ? That Egypt is in Africa ? That the Ethiopia we read about in the bible meant all of Africa ? Well , I read and I read until I thought my eyes would fall out . I read where the Africans sold us because they loved money more than their own sisters and brothers . How we came to America in ships . How we were made to work . I had n't realized I was so ignorant , Celie . The little I knew about my own self would n't have filled a thimble ! And to think111Miss Beasley always said I was the smartest child she ever taught ! But one thing I do thank her for , for teaching me to learn for myself , by reading and studying and writing a clear hand . And for keeping alive in me somehow the desire to know . So when Corrine and Samuel asked me if I would come with them and help them build a school in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they would teach me everything they knew to make me useful as a missionary and someone they would not be ashamed to call a friend . They agreed to this condition , and my real education began at that time . They have been as good as their word . And I study everything night and day . Oh , Celie , there are colored people in the world who want us to know ! Want us to grow and see the light ! They are not all mean like Pa and Albert , or beaten down like ma was . Corrine and Samuel have a wonderful marriage . Their only sorrow in the beginning was that they could not have children . And then , they say , " God " sent them Olivia and Adam . I wanted to say , " God " has sent you their sister and aunt , but I did n't . Yes , their children , sent by " God " are your children , Celie . And they are being brought up in love , Christiancharity and awareness of God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over them , to protect and cherish them . To lavish all the love I feel for you on them . It is a miracle , is n't it ? And no doubt impossible for you to believe . But on the other hand , if you can believe I am in Africa , and I am , you can believe anything . Your sister , Nettie112The next letter after that one say , Dear Celie , While we were in town Corrine bought cloth to make me two sets of traveling outfits . One olive green and the other gray . Long gored skirts and suit jackets to be worn with white cotton blouses and lace-up boots . She also bought me a woman 's boater with a checkered band . Although I work for Corrine and Samuel and look after the children , I do n't feel like a maid . I guess this is because they teach me , and I teach the children and there 's no beginning or end to teaching and learning and working  --  it all runs together . Saying good-bye to our church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has such high hopes for what can be done in Africa . Over the pulpit there is a saying : Ethiopia Shall Stretch Forth Her Hands to God . Think what it means that Ethiopia is Africa ! All the Ethiopians in the bible were colored . It had never occurred to me , though when you read the bible it is perfectly plain if you pay attention only to the words . It is the pictures in the bible that fool you . The pictures that illustrate the words . All of the people are white and so you just think all the people from the bible were white too . But really white white people lived somewhere else during those times . That 's why the bible says that Jesus Christ had hair like lamb 's wool . Lamb 's wool is not straight , Celie . It is n't even curly . What can I tell you about New York  --  or even about the train that took us there ! We had to ride in the sit-down section of the train , but Celie , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The beds come down out of the walls , over the tops of the seats , and are called berths . Only white people can ride in113the beds and use the restaurant . And they have different toilets from colored . One white man on the platform in South Carolina asked us where we were going  --  we had got off the train to get some fresh air and to dust the grit and dust out of our clothes . When we said Africa he looked offended and tickled too . Niggers going to Africa , he said to his wife . Now I have seen everything . When we got to New York we were tired and dirty . But so excited ! Listen , Celie , New York is a beautiful city . And colored own a whole section of it , called Harlem . There are colored people in more fancy motor cars than I thought existed , and living in houses that are finer than any white person 's house down home . There are more than a hundred churches ! And we went to every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samuel and Corrine and the children and sometimes our mouths just dropped open from the generosity and goodnessof those Harlem people 's hearts . They live in such beauty and dignity , Celie . And they give and give and then reach down and give some more , when the name " Africa " is mentioned . They love Africa . They defend it at the drop of a hat . And speaking of hats , if we had passed our hats alone they would not have been enough to hold all the donations to our enterprise . Even the children dredged up their pennies . Please give these to the children of Africa , they said . They were all dressed so beautifully , too , Celie . I wish you could have seen them . There is a fashion in Harlem now for boys to wear something called knickers  --  sort of baggy pants , fitted tight just below the knee , and for girls to wear garlands of flowers in their hair . They must be the most beautiful children alive , and Adam and Olivia could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinners we were invited to , the breakfasts , lunches , and suppers . I gained five pounds just from tasting . I was too excited to really eat . And all the people have indoor toilets , Celie . And gas or electric lights ! Well , we had two weeks of study in the Olinka dialect , which the people in this region speak . Then we were examined by a doctor ( colored ! ) and given medical supplies for ourselves114and for our host village by the Missionary Society of New York . It is run by white people and they did n't say anything about caring about Africa , but only about duty . There is already a white woman missionary not far from our village who has lived in Africa for the past twenty years . She is said to be much loved by the natives even though she thinks they are an entirely different species from what she calls Europeans . Europeans are white people who live in a place called Europe . That is where the white people down home came from . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers , but totally different kinds . The man at the Society says she is successful because she does n't " coddle " her charges . She also speaks their language . He is a white man who looks at us as if we can not possibly be as good with the Africans as this woman is . My spirits sort of drooped after being at the Society . On every wall there was a picture of a white man . Somebody called Speke , somebody called Livingstone . Somebody called Daly . Or was it Stanley ? I looked for a picture of the white woman but did n't see one . Samuel looked a little sad too , but then he perked up and reminded us that there is one big advantage we have . We are not white . We are not Europeans . We are black like the Africans themselves . And that we and the Africans will be working for a common goal : the uplift of black people everywhere . Your sister , Nettie115Dear Celie , Samuel is a big man . He dresses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerical collar . And he is black . Until you see his eyes you think he 's somber , even mean , but he has the most thoughtful and gentle brown eyes . When he says something it settles you , because he never says anything off the top of his head and he 's never out to dampen your spirit or to hurt . Corrine is a lucky woman to have him as her husband . But let me tell you about the ship ! The ship , called The Malaga , was three stories high ! And we had rooms ( called cabins ) with beds . Oh , Celie , to lie in a bed in the middle of the ocean ! And the ocean ! Celie , more water than you can imagine in one place . It took us two weeks to cross it ! And then we were in England , which is a country full of white people and some of them very nice and with their own Anti-Slavery &; Missionary Society . The churches in England were also very eager to help us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ones at home , invited us to their gatherings and into their homes for tea , and to talk about our work . " Tea " to the English is really a picnic indoors . Plenty of sandwiches and cookies and of course hot tea . We all used the same cups and plates . Everyone said I seemed very young to be a missionary , but Samuel said that I was very willing , and that , anyway , my primary duties would be helping with the children and teaching a kindergarten class or two . Our work began to seem somewhat clearer in England because the English have been sending missionaries to Africa116and India and China and God knows where all , for over a hundred years . And the things they have brought back ! We spent a morning in one of their museums and it was packed with jewels , furniture , fur carpets , swords , clothing , even tombs from all the countries they have been . From Africa they have thousands of vases , jars , masks , bowls , baskets , statues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imagine that the people who made them do n't still exist . And yet the English assure us they do not . Although Africans once had a better civilization than the European ( though of course even the English do not say this : I get this from reading a man named J. A. Rogers ) for several centuries they have fallen on hard times . " Hard times " is a phrase the English love to use , when speaking of Africa . And it is easy to forget that Africa 's " hard times " were made harder by them . Millions and millions of Africans were captured and sold into slavery  --  you and me , Celie ! And whole cities were destroyed by slave catching wars . Today the people of Africa  --  having murdered or sold into slavery their strongest folks  --  are riddled by disease and sunk in spiritual and physical confusion . They believe in the devil and worship the dead . Nor can they read or write . Why did they sell us ? How could they have done it ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts I had as we tramped through the chilly streets of London . I studied England on a map , so neat and serene , and I became hopeful in spite of myself that much good for Africa is possible , given hard work and the right frame of mind . And then we sailed for Africa . Leaving Southampton , England on the 24th of July and arriving in Monrovia , Liberia on the 12th of September . On the way we stopped in Lisbon , Portugal and Dakar , Senegal . Monrovia was the last place we were among people we were somewhat used to , since it is an African country that was " founded " by ex-slaves from America who came back to Africa to live . Had any of their parents or grandparents been sold from Monrovia , I wondered , and what was their feeling , once sold as slaves , now coming back , with close ties to the country that bought them , to rule. 117Celie , I must stop now . The sun is not so hot now and I must prepare for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were with me , or I with you . My love , Your sister , Nettie118Dearest Celie , It was the funniest thing to stop over in Monrovia after my first glimpse of Africa , which was Senegal . The capital of Senegal is Dakar and the people speak their own language , Senegalese I guess they would call it , and French . They are the blackest people I have ever seen , Celie . They are black like the people we are talking about when we say , " So and so is blacker than black , he 's blueblack . " They are so black , Celie , they shine . Which is something else folks down home like to say about real black folks . But Celie , try to imagine a city full of these shining , blueblack people wearing brilliant blue robes with designs like fancy quilt patterns . Tall , thin , with long necks and straight backs . Can you picture it at all , Celie ? Because I felt like I was seeing black for the first time . And Celie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so black the eye is simply dazzled , and then there is the shining that seems to come , really , from moonlight , it is so luminous , but their skin glows even in the sun . But I did not really like the Senegalese I met in the market . They were concerned only with their sale of produce . If we did not buy , they looked through us as quickly as they looked through the white French people who live there . Somehow I had not expected to see any white people in Africa , but they are here in droves . And not all are missionaries . There are bunches of them in Monrovia , too . And the president , whose last name is Tubman , has some in his cabinet . He also has a lot of white-looking colored men in his cabinet . On our second evening in Monrovia we had tea at the presidential palace . It looks very much like the American white house119 ( where our president lives ) Samuel says . The president talked a good bit about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems with the natives , who do n't want to work to help build the country up . It was the first time I 'd heard a black man use that word . I knew that to white people all colored people are natives . But he cleared his throat and said he only meant " native " to Liberia . I did not see any of these " natives " in his cabinet . And none of the cabinet members ' wives could pass for natives . Compared to them in their silks and pearls , Corrine and I were barely dressed , let alone dressed for the occasion . But I think the women we saw at the palace spend a lot of their time dressing . Still , they look dissatisfied . Not like the cheery schoolteacherswe saw only by chance , as they herded their classes down to the beach for a swim . Before we left we visited one of the large cacoa plantations they have . Nothing but cacoa trees as far as the eye can see . And whole villages built right in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come home from work , still carrying their cacoa seed buckets in their hands ( these double as lunch buckets next day ) , and sometimes  --  if they are women  --  their children on their backs . As tired as they are , they sing ! Celie . Just like we do at home . Why do tired people sing ? I asked Corrine . Too tired to do anything else , she said . Besides , they do n't own the cacoa fields , Celie , even president Tubman does n't own them . People in a place called Holland do . The people who make Dutch chocolate . And there are overseers who make sure the people work hard , who live in stone houses in the corners of the fields . Again I must go . Everyone is in bed and I am writing by lamplight . But the light is attracting so many bugs I am being eaten alive . I have bites everywhere , including my scalp and the bottoms of my feet . ButDid I mention my first sight of the African coast ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a large bell , and I just vibrated . Corrine and Samuel felt the same . And we kneeled down right on deck and gave thanks to God for letting us see the120land for which our mothers and fathers cried  --  and lived and died  --  to see again . Oh , Celle ! Will I ever be able to tell you all ? I dare not ask , I know . But leave it all to God . Your everloving sister , Nettie121Me , Celie , think about me a little bit . Miss Celie , if you kill Albert , Grady be all I got left . I ca n't even stand the thought of that . I laugh , thinking bout Grady 's big toofs . Make Albert let me sleep with you from now on , while you here , I say . And somehow or other , she do . Dear God , What with being shock , crying and blowing my nose , and trying to puzzle out words us do n't know , it took a long time to read just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up to where she good and settled in Africa , Mr. and Gradycome home . Can you handle it ? ast Shug . How I 'm gon keep from killing him , I say . Do n't kill , she say . Nettie be coming home before long . Do n't make her have to look at you like us look at Sofia . But it so hard , I say , while Shug empty her suitcase and put the letters inside . Hard to be Christ too , say Shug . But he manage . Remember that . Thou Shalt Not Kill , He said . And probably wanted to add on to that , Starting with me . He knowed the fools he was dealing with . But Mr. not Christ . I 'm not Christ , I say . You somebody to Nettie , she say . And she be pissed if you change on her while she on her way home . Us hear Grady and Mr. in the kitchen . Dishesrattling , safe door open and shut . Naw , I think I feel better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sickish . Numb , now . Naw you wo n't . Nobody feel better for killing nothing . They feel something is all . That better than nothing . Celie , she say , Nettie not the only one you got to worry bout . Say what ? I ast. 122123Dear God , Us sleep like sisters , me and Shug . Much as I still want to be with her , much as I love to look , my titties stay soft , my little button never rise . Now I know I 'm dead . But she say , Naw , just being mad , grief , wanting to kill somebody will make you feel this way . Nothing to worry about . Titties gon na perk up , button gon na rise again . I loves to hug up , period , she say . Snuggle . Do n't need nothing else right now . Yeah , I say . Hugging is good . Snuggle . All of it 's good . She say , Times like this , lulls , us ought to do something different . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . looking me up and down , let 's make you some pants . What I need pants for ? I say . I ai n't no man . Do n't git uppity , she say . But you do n't have a dress do nothing for you . You not made like no dress pattern , neither . I do n't know , I say . Mr. not going to let his wife wear pants . Why not ? say Shug . You do all the work around here . It 's a scandless , the way you look out there plowing in a dress . How you keep from falling over it or getting the plow caught in it is beyond me . Yeah ? I say . Yeah . And another thing , I used to put on Albert 's pants when we was courting . And he one time put on my dress . No he did n't . Yes he did . He use to be a lot of fun . Not like now . But he loved to see me in pants . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say . I could just picture it , and I did n't like it one bit . Well , you know how they is , say Shug . What us gon make ' em out of , I say . We have to git our hands on somebody 's army uniform , say Shug . For practice . That good strong material and free . Jack , I say . Odessa 's husband . Okay , she say . And every day we going to read Nettie 's letters and sew . A needle and not a razor in my hand , I think . She do n't say nothing else , just come over to me and hug. 125Dear God , Now I know Nettie alive I begin to strut a little bit . Think , When she come home us leave here . Her and me and our two children . What they look like , I wonder . But it hard to think bout them . I feels shame . More than love , to tell the truth . Anyway , is they all right here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by incest turn into dunces . Incest part of the devil 's plan . But I think bout Nettie . It 's hot , here , Celie , she write . Hotter than July . Hotter than August and July . Hot like cooking dinner on a big stove in a little kitchen in August and July . Hot . Dear Celie , We were met at the ship by an African from the village we are settling in . His Christian name is Joseph . He is short and fat , with hands that seem not to have any bones in them . When he shook my hand it felt like something soft and damp was falling and I almost caught it . He speaks a little English , what they call pidgin English . It is very different from the way we speak English , but somehow familiar . He helped us unload our things from the ship into the boats that came out to get us . These boats are really dug-out canoes , like the Indians had , the ones you see in pictures . With all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth one carried our medical and teaching supplies . Once in the boat we were entertained by the songs of our boatmen as they tried to outpaddle each other to the shore . They paid very little attention to us or our cargo . When we reached the shore they did n't bother to help us alight from the126boat and actually set some of our supplies right down in the water . As soon as they had browbeat poor Samuel out of a tip that Joseph said was too big , they were off hallooing another group of people who were waiting at the edge of the water to be taken to the ship . The port is pretty , but too shallow for large ships to use . So there is a good business for the boatmen , during the season the ships come by . These boatmen were all considerably larger and more muscular than Joseph , though all of them , including Joseph , are a deep chocolate brown . Not black , like the Senegalese . And Celie , they all have the strongest , cleanest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the voyage over , because I had toothache nearly the entire time . You know how rotten my back teeth are . And in England I was struck by the English people 's teeth . So crooked , usually , and blackish with decay . I wondered if it was the English water . But the Africans ' teeth remind me of horses ' teeth , they are so fully formed , straight and strong . The port 's " town " is the size of the hardware store in town . Inside there are stalls filled with cloth , hurricane lamps and oil , mosquito netting , camp bedding , hammocks , axes and hoes and machetes and other tools . The whole place is run by a white man , but some of the stalls that sell produce are rented out to Africans . Joseph showed us things we needed to buy . A large iron pot for boiling water and our clothes , a zinc basin . Mosquitonetting . Nails . Hammer and saw and pick-ax . Oil and lamps . Since there was nowhere to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young men loafing around the trading post and we left right away for Olinka , some four days march through the bush . Jungle , to you . Or maybe not . Do you know what a jungle is ? Well . Trees and trees and then more trees on top of that . And big . They are so big they look like they were built . And vines . And ferns . And little animals . Frogs . Snakes too , according to Joseph . But thank God we did not see any of these , only humpbacked lizards as big as your arm which the people here catch and eat . They love meat . All the people in this village . Sometimes if127you ca n't get them to do anything any other way , you start to mention meat , either a little piece extra you just happen to have or maybe , if you want them to do something big , you talk about a barbecue . Yes , a barbecue . They remind me of folks at home ! Well , we got here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of my hips from being carried in a hammock the whole way . Everybody in the village crowded round us . Coming out of little round huts with something that I thought was straw on top of them but is really a kind of leaf that grows everywhere . They pick it and dry it and lay it so it overlaps to make the roof rainproof . This part is women 's work . Menfolks drive the stakes for the hut and sometimes help build the walls with mud and rock from the streams . You never saw such curious faces as the village folks surrounded us with . At first they just looked . Then one or two of the women touched my and Corrine 's dresses . My dress was so dirty round the hem from dragging on the ground for three nights of cooking round a campfire that I was ashamed of myself . But then I took a look at the dresses they were wearing . Most looked like they 'd been drug across the yard by the pigs . And they do n't fit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying a word yet  --  and touched our hair . Then looked down at our shoes . We looked at Joseph . Then he told us they were acting this way because the missionaries before us were all white . And they naturally thought all missionaries were white people , and vice versa . The men had been to the port , some of them , and had seen the white merchant , so they knew white men could be something else too . But the women had never been to the port and the only white person they 'd seen was the missionary they had buried a year ago . Samuel asked if they 'd ever seen the white woman missionarytwenty miles farther on , and he said no . Twenty miles through the jungle is a very long trip . The men might hunt up to ten miles around the village , but the women stayed close to their huts and fields . Then one of the women asked a question . We looked at Joseph . He said the woman wanted to know if the children belonged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph said they128belonged to Corrine . The woman looked us both over , and said something else . We looked at Joseph . He said the woman said they both looked like me . We all laughed politely . Then another woman had a question . She wanted to know if I was also Samuel 's wife . Joseph said no , that I was a missionary just like Samuel and Corrine . Then someone said they never suspected missionaries could have children . Then another said he never dreamed missionaries could be black . Then someone said , That the new missionaries would be black and two of them women was exactly what he had dreamed , and just last night , too . By now there was a lot of commotion . Little heads began to pop from behind mothers ' skirts and over big sisters ' shoulders . And we were sort of swept along among the villagers , about three hundred of them , to a place without walls but with a leaf roof , where we all sat down on the ground , men in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispering among some very old men who looked like the church elders back home  --  with their baggy trousers and shiny , ill-fitting coats  --  Did black missionaries drink palm wine ? Corrine looked at Samuel and Samuel looked at Corrine . But me and the children were already drinking it , because someone had already put the little brown clay glasses in our hands and we were too nervous not to start sipping . We got there around four o'clock , and sat under the leaf canopy until nine . We had our first meal there , a chicken and groundnut ( peanut ) stew which we ate with our fingers . But mostly we listened to songs and watched dances that raised lots of dust . The biggest part of the welcoming ceremony was about the roofleaf , which Joseph interpreted for us as one of the villagers recited the story that it is based upon . The people of this village think they have always lived on the exact spot where their village now stands . And this spot has been good to them . They plant cassava @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . They plant yam and cotton and millet . All kinds of things . But once , a long time ago , one man in the129village wanted more than his share of land to plant . He wanted to make more crops so as to use his surplus for trade with the white men on the coast . Because he was chief at the time , he gradually took more and more of the common land , and took more and more wives to work it . As his greed increased he also began to cultivate the land on which the roofleaf grew . Even his wives were upset by this and tried to complain , but they were lazy women and no one paid any attention to them . Nobody could remember a time when roofleaf did not exist in overabundantamounts . But eventually , the greedy chief took so much of this land that even the elders were disturbed . So he simply bought them off  --  with axes and cloth and cooking pots that he got from the coast traders . But then there came a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roofs on all the huts in the village , and the people discovered to their dismay there was cassava . Millet . Groundnuts . For six months the heavens and the winds abused the people of Olinka . Rain came down in spears , stabbing away the mud of their walls . The wind was so fierce it blew the rocks out of the walls and into the people 's cooking pots . Then cold rocks , shaped like millet balls , fell from the sky , striking everyone , men and women and children alike , and giving them fevers . The children fell ill first , then their parents . Soon the village began to die . By the end of the rainy season , half the village was gone . The people prayed to their gods and waited impatiently for the seasons to change . As soon as the rain stopped they rushed to the old roofleaf beds and tried to find the old roots . But of the endless numbers that had always grown there , only a few dozen remained . It was five years before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many more in the village died . Many left , never to return . Many were eaten by animals . Many , many were sick . The chief was given all his storebought utensils and forced to walk away from the village forever . His wives were given to other men . On the day when all the huts had roofs again from the roof-130leaf , the villagers celebrated by singing and dancing and telling the story of the roofleaf . The roofleaf became the thing they worship . Looking over the heads of the children at the end of this tale , I saw coming slowly towards us , a large brown spiky thing as big as a room , with a dozen legs walking slowly and carefully under it . When it reached our canopy , it was presented to us . It was our roof . As it approached , the people bowed down . The white missionary before you would not let us have this ceremony , said Joseph . But the Olinka like it very much . We know a roofleaf is not Jesus Christ , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God ? So there we sat , Celie , face to face with the Olinka God . And Celie , I was so tired and sleepy and full of chicken and groundnut stew , my ears ringing with song , that all that Joseph said made perfect sense to me . I wonder what you will make of all this ? I send my love , Your sister , Nettie131Dear Celie , It has been a long time since I had time to write . But always , no matter what I 'm doing , I am writing to you . Dear Celie , I say in my head in the middle of Vespers , the middle of the night , while cooking , Dear , dear Celie . And I imagine that you really do get my letters and that you are writing me back : Dear Nettie , this is what life is like for me . We are up at five o'clock for a light breakfast of millet porridge and fruit , and the morning classes . We teach the children English , reading , writing , history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At eleven o'clock we break for lunch and household duties . From one until four it is too hot to move , though some of the mothers sit behind their huts and sew . At four o'clock we teach the older children and at night we are available for adults . Some of the older children are used to coming to the mission school , but the smaller ones are not . Their mothers sometimes drag them here , screaming and kicking . They are all boys . Olivia is the only girl . The Olinka do not believe girls should be educated . When I asked a mother why she thought this , she said : A girl is nothing to herself ; only to her husband can she become something . What can she become ? I asked . Why , she said , the mother of his children . But I am not the mother of anybody 's children , I said , and I am something . You are not much , she said . The missionary 's drudge . It is true that I work harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I sweep out the school and tidy up after service , but I do n't feel like a drudge . I was surprised that this woman , 132whose Christian name is Catherine , saw me in this light . She has a little girl , Tashi , who plays with Olivia after school . Adam is the only boy who will speak to Olivia at school . They are not mean to her , it is just  --  what is it ? Because she is where they are doing " boys ' things " they do not see her . But never fear , Celie , Olivia has your stubbornness and clearsightedness , and she is smarter than all of them , including Adam , put together . Why ca n't Tashi come to school ? she asked me . When I told her the Olinka do n't believe in educating girls she said , quick as a flash , They 're like white people at home who do n't want colored people to learn . Oh , she 's sharp , Celie . At the end of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother assigns her , she and Olivia secret themselves in my hut and everything Olivia has learned she shares with Tashi . To Olivia right now Tashi alone is Africa . The Africa she came beaming across the ocean hoping to find . Everything else is difficult for her . The insects , for instance . For some reason , all of her bites turn into deep , runny sores , and she has a lot of trouble sleeping at night because the noises from the forest frighten her . It is taking a long time for her to become used to the food , which is nourishing but , for the most part , indifferently prepared . The women of the village take turns cooking for us , and some are cleaner and more conscientious than others . Olivia gets sick from the food prepared by any of the chief 's wives . Samuel thinks it may be the water they use , which comes from a separate spring that runs clear even in the dry season . But the rest of us have no ill effects . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they all look so unhappy and work so hard . Whenever they see her they talk about the day when she will become their littlest sister/wife . It is just a joke , and they like her , but I wish they would n't say it . Even though they are unhappy and work like donkeys they still think it is an honor to be the chief 's wife . He walks around all day holding his belly up and talking and drinking palm wine with the healer . Why do they say I will be a wife of the chief ? asks Olivia . That is as high as they can think , I tell her. 133He is fat and shiny with huge perfect teeth . She thinks she has nightmares about him . You will grow up to be a strong Christian woman , I tell her . Someone who helps her people to advance . You will be a teacher or a nurse . You will travel . You will know many people greater than the chief . Will Tashi ? she wants to know . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me this morning , Nettie , to stop any kind of confusion in the minds of these people , I think we should call one another brother and sister , all the time . Some of them ca n't seem to get it through their thick skulls that you are not Samuel 's other wife . I do n't like it , she said . Almost since the day we arrived I 've noticed a change in Corrine . She is n't sick . She works as hard as ever . She is still sweet and good-natured . But sometimes I sense her spirit is being tested and that something in her is not at rest . That 's fine , I said . I 'm glad you brought it up . And do n't let the children call you Mama Nettie , she said , even in play . This bothered me a little , but I did n't say anything . The children do call me Mama Nettie sometimes because I do a good bit of fussing over them . But I never try to take Corrine 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we ought to try not to borrow each other 's clothes . Well , she never borrowed anything of mine because I do n't have much . But I 'm all the time borrowing something of hers . You feeling yourself ? I asked her . She said yes . I wish you could see my hut , Celie . I love it . Unlike our school , which is square , and unlike our church , which does n't have walls  --  at least during the dry season  --  my hut is round , walled , with a round roofleaf roof . It is twenty steps across the middle and fits me to a T. Over the mud walls I have hung Olinka platters and mats and pieces of tribal cloth . The Olinka are known for their beautiful cotton fabric which they handweaveand dye with berries , clay , indigo and tree bark . Then there is my paraffin camp stove in the center , and my camp bed134to one side , covered with mosquito netting so that it almost looks like the bed of a bride . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you , a lamp , and a stool . Some wonderful rush mats on the floor . It is all colorful and warm and homey . My only desire for it now is a window ! None of the village huts have windows , and when I spoke of a window to the women they laughed heartily . The rainy season makes the thought of a window ridiculous , apparently . But I am determined to have one , even if a flood collects daily on my floor . I would give anything for a picture of you , Celie . In my trunk I have pictures donated to us by the missionary societies in England and America . Pictures of Christ , the Apostles , Mary , the Crucifixion . Speke , Livingstone . Stanley . Schweitzer . Maybe one day I 'll put them up , but once , when I held them up to my fabric and mat covered walls they made me feel very small and unhappy , so I took them down . Even the picture of Christ which generally looks good anywhere looks peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung in the school and many of Christ behind the altar at the church . That is enough , I think , though Samuel and Corrine have pictures and relics ( crosses ) in their hut as well . Your sister , Nettie135Dear Celie , Tashi ' s mother and father were just here . They are upset because she spends so much time with Olivia . She is changing , becoming quiet and too thoughtful , they say . She is becoming someone else ; her face is beginning to show the spirit of one of her aunts who was sold to the trader because she no longer fit into village life . This aunt refused to marry the man chosen for her . Refused to bow to the chief . Did nothing but lay up , crack cola nuts between her teeth and giggle . They want to know what Olivia and Tashi do in my hut when all the other little girls are busy helping their mothers . Is Tashi lazy at home ? I asked . The father looked at the mother . She said , No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls her age . And is quicker to finish her work . But it is only because she wishes to spend her afternoons with Olivia . She learns everything I teach her as if she already knows it , said the mother , but this knowledge does not really enter her soul . The mother seemed puzzled and afraid . The father , angry . I thought : Aha . Tashi knows she is learning a way of life she will never live . But I did not say this . The world is changing , I said . It is no longer a world just for boys and men . Our women are respected here , said the father . We would never let them tramp the world as American women do . There is always someone to look after the Olinka woman . A father . An uncle . A brother or nephew . Do not be offended , Sister Nettie , but our people pity women such as you who are cast out , we136know not from where , into a world unknown to you , where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am an object of pity and contempt , I thought , to men and women alike . Furthermore , said Tashi ' s father , we are not simpletons . We understand that there are places in the world where women live differently from the way our women do , but we do not approve of this different way for our children . But life is changing , even in Olinka , I said . We are here . He spat on the ground . What are you ? Three grownups and two children . In the rainy season some of you will probably die . You people do not last long in our climate . If you do not die , you will be weakened by illness . Oh , yes . We have seen it all before . You Christians come here , try hard to change us , get sick and go back to England , or wherever you come from . Only the trader on the coast remains , and even he is not the same white man , year in and year out . We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I said . She could be a teacher . A nurse . She could help the people in the village . There is no place here for a woman to do those things , he said . Then we should leave , I said . Sister Corrine and I. No , no , he said . Teach only the boys ? I asked . Yes , he said , as if my question was agreement . There is a way that the men speak to women that reminds me too much of Pa . They listen just long enough to issue instructions . They do n't even look at women when women are speaking . They look at the ground and bend their heads toward the ground . The women also do not " look in a man 's face " as they say . To " look in a man 's face " is a brazen thing to do . They look instead at his feet or his knees . And what can I say to this ? Again , it is our own behavior around Pa . Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her straight home , her father said . Then he smiled . Your Olivia can visit her , and learn what women are for . I smiled also . Olivia must learn to take her education about137life where she can find it , I thought . His offer will make a splendid opportunity . Good-bye until the next time , dear Celie , from a pitiful , cast-out woman who may perish during the rainy season . Your loving sister , Nettie138Dear Celie , At first there was the faintest sound of movement in the forest . A kind of low humming . Then there was chopping and the sound of dragging . Then a scent , some days , of smoke . But now , after two months , during which I or the children or Corrine has been sick , all we hear is chopping and scraping and dragging . And every day we smell smoke . Today one of the boys in my afternoon class burst out , as he entered , The road approaches ! The road approaches ! He had been hunting in the forest with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villagers gather at the edge of the village near the cassava fields , and watch the building of the road . And watching them , some on their stools and some squatted down on their haunches , all chewing cola nuts and making patterns in the dirt , I feel a great surge of love for them . For they do not approach the roadbuilders empty-handedly . Oh , no . Each day since they saw the road 's approach they have been stuffing the roadbuilders with goat meat , millet mush , baked yam and cassava , cola nuts and palm wine . Each day is like a picnic , and I believe many friendships have been made , although the roadbuildersare from a different tribe some distance to the North and nearer the coast , and their language is somewhat different . I do n't understand it , anyway , though the people of Olinka seem to . But they are clever people about most things , and understandnew things very quickly . It is hard to believe we 've been here five years . Time moves slowly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall as me and doing very well in all their studies . Adam has a special aptitude for figures and it worries Samuel that soon he will have nothing more to teach him in this field , having exhausted his own knowledge. 139When we were in England we met missionaries who sent their children back home when it was no longer possible to teach them in the bush . But it is hard to imagine life here without the children . They love the open feeling of the village , and love living in huts . They are excited by the hunting expertise of the men and the self-sufficiency of the women in raising their crops . No matter how down I may be , and sometimes I get very down indeed , a hug from Olivia or Adam completely restores me to the level of functioning , if nothing else . Their mother and I are not as close as we once were , but I feel more like their aunt than ever . And the three of us look more and more alike every day . About a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hut unless she were present . She said it gave the villagers the wrong idea . This was a real blow to me because I treasure his company . Since Corrine almost never visits me herself I will have hardly anybody to talk to , just in friendship . But the children still come and sometimes spend the night when their parents want to be alone . I love those times . We roast ground- nuts on my stove , sit on the floor and study maps of all the countries in the world . Sometimes Tashi comes over and tells stories that are popular among the Olinka children . I am encouraging her and Olivia to write them down in Olinka and English . It will be good practice for them . Olivia feels that , compared to Tashi , she has no good stories to tell . One day she started in on an " Uncle Remus " tale only to discover Tashi had the original version of it ! Her little face just fell . But then we got into a discussion of how Tashi 's people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She cried when Olivia told how her grandmother had been treated as a slave . No one else in this village wants to hear about slavery , however . They acknowledge no responsibility whatsoever . This is one thing about them that I definitely do not like . We lost Tashi 's father during the last rainy season . He fell ill with malaria and nothing the healer concocted saved him . He refused to take the medicine we use for it , or to let Samuel visit him at all . It was my first Olinka funeral . The women paint their140faces white and wear white shroudlike garments and cry in a high keening voice . They wrapped the body in barkcloth and buried it under a big tree in the forest . Tashi was heartbroken . All her young life she has tried to please her father , never quite realizing that , as a girl , she never could . But the death brought her and her mother closer together , and now Catherine feels like one of us . By one of us I mean me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mourning and sticking close to her hut , but she says she will not marry again ( since she already has five boy children she can now do whatever she wants . She has become an honorary man ) and when I went to visit her she made it very clear that Tashi must continue to learn . She is the most industrious of all Tashi ' s father 's widows , and her fields are praised for their cleanliness , productivity and general attractiveness . Perhaps I can help her with her work . It is in work that the women get to know and care about each other . It was through work that Catherine became friends with her husband 's other wives . This friendship among women is something Samuel often talks about . Because the women share a husband but the husband does not share their friendships , it makes Samuel uneasy . It is confusing , I suppose . And it is Samuel 's duty as a Christian minister to preach the bible 's directive of one husband and one wife . Samuel is confused because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do anything for one another  --  not always , but more often than anyone from America would expect  --  and since they giggle and gossip and nurse each other 's children , then they must be happy with things as they are . But many of the women rarely spend time with their husbands . Some of them were promised to old or middle-aged men at birth . Their lives always center around work and their children and other women ( since a woman can not really have a man for a friend without the worst kind of ostracism and gossip ) . They indulge their husbands , if anything . You should just see how they make admiration over them . Praise their smallest accomplishments . Stuff them with palm wine and sweets . No wonder the men are often childish . And a grown child is a dangerous141thing , especially since , among the Olinka , the husband has life and death power over the wife . If he accuses one of his wives of witchcraft or infidelity , she can be killed . Thank God ( and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been here . But the stories Tashi tells are often about such gruesome events that happened in the recent past . And God forbid that the child of a favorite wife should fall ill ! That is the point at which even the women 's friendships break down , as each woman fears the accusation of sorcery from the other , or from the husband . Merry Christmas to you and yours , dear Celie . We celebrate it here on the " dark " continent with prayer and song and a large picnic complete with watermelon , fresh fruit punch , and barbecue ! God bless you , Nettie142Dearest Celie , I meant to write you in time for Easter , but it was not a good time for me and I did not want to burden you with any distressing news . So a whole year has gone by . The first thing I should tell you about is the road . The road finally reached the cassava fields about nine months ago and the Olinka , who love nothing better than a celebration , outdid themselves preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut their eyes at the Olinka women the whole day . In the evening many were invited into the village itself and there was merrymaking far into the night . I think Africans are very much like white people back home , in that they think they are the center of the universe and that everything that is done is done for them . The Olinka definitely hold this view . And so they naturally thought the road being built was for them . And , in fact , the roadbuilders talked much of how quickly the Olinka will now be able to get to the coast . With a tarmac road it is only a three-day journey . By bicycle it will be even less . Of course no one in Olinka owns a bicycle , but one of the roadbuilders has one , and all the Olinka men covet it and talk of someday soon purchasing their own . Well , the morning after the road was " finished " as far as the Olinka were concerned ( after all , it had reached their village ) , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . They have instructions to continue the road for another thirty miles ! And to continue it on its present course right through the village of Olinka . By the time we were out of bed , the road was already being dug through Catherine 's newly planted yam field . Of course the Olinka were up in arms . But the143roadbuilders were literally up in arms . They had guns , Celie , with orders to shoot ! It was pitiful , Celie . The people felt so betrayed ! They stood by helplessly  --  they really do n't know how to fight , and rarely think of it since the old days of tribal wars  --  as their crops and then their very homes were destroyed . Yes . The roadbuilders did n't deviate an inch from the plan the headman was following . Every hut that lay in the proposed roadpath was leveled . And , Celie , our church , our school , my hut , all went down in a matter of hours . Fortunately , we were able to save all of our things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of it , the village itself seems gutted . Immediately after understanding the roadbuilders ' intentions , the chief set off toward the coast , seeking explanations and reparations . Two weeks later he returned with even more disturbing news . The whole territory , including the Olinkas ' village , now belongs to a rubber manufacturer in England . As he neared the coast , he was stunned to see hundreds and hundreds of villagers much like the Olinka clearing the forests on each side of the road , and planting rubber trees . The ancient , giant mahogany trees , all the trees , the game , everything of the forest was being destroyed , and the land was forced to lie flat , he said , and bare as the palm of his hand . At first he thought the people who told him about the English rubber company were mistaken , if only about its territoryincluding the Olinka village . But eventually he was directed to the governor 's mansion , a huge white building , with flags flying in its yard , and there had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was this man who gave the roadbuilders their orders , this man who knew about the Olinka only from a map . I le spoke in English , which our chief tried to speak also . It must have been a pathetic exchange . Our chief never learned English beyond an occasional odd phrase he picked up from Joseph , who pronounces " English " " Yanglush . " But the worst was yet to be told . Since the Olinka no longer own their village , they must pay rent for it , and in order to use the water , which also no longer belongs to them , they must pay a water tax. 144At first the people laughed . It really did seem crazy . They 've been here forever . But the chief did not laugh . We will fight the white man , they said . But the white man is not alone , said the chief . He has brought his army . That was several months ago , and so far nothing has happened . The people live like ostriches , never setting foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and never , ever , looking towards the coast . We have built another church and school . I have another hut . And so we wait . Meanwhile , Corrine has been very ill with African fever . Many missionaries in the past have died from it . But the children are fine . The boys now accept Olivia and Tashi in class and more mothers are sending their daughters to school . The men do not like it : who wants a wife who knows everything her husband knows ? they fume . But the women have their ways , and they love their children , even their girls . I will write more when things start looking up . I trust God they will . Your sister , Nettie145Dearest Celie , This whole year , after Easter , has been difficult . Since Corrine 's illness , all her work has fallen on me , and I must nurse her as well , which she resents . One day when I was changing her as she lay in bed , she gave me a long , mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you ? she asked . Do you really think they look so much like me ? I said . You could have spit them out , she said . Maybe just living together , loving people makes them look like you , I said . You know how much some old married people look alike . Even these women saw the resemblance the first day we came , she said . And that 's worried you all this time ? I tried to laugh it off . But she just looked at me . When did you first meet my husband ? she wanted to know . And that was when I knew what she thought . She thinks Adam and Olivia are my children , and that Samuel is their father ! Oh , Celie , this thing has been gnawing away at her all these years ! I met Samuel the same day I met you , Corrine , I said . ( I still have n't got the hang of saying " Sister " all the time . ) As God is my witness , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I brought the bible , and placed my hand on it , and swore . You 've never known me to lie , Corrine , I said . Please believe I am not lying now. 146Then she called Samuel , and made him swear that the day she met me was the day he met me also . He said : I apologize for this , Sister Nettie , please forgive us . As soon as Samuel left the room she made me raise my dress and she sat up in her sickbed to examine my stomach . I felt so sorry for her , and so humiliated , Celie . And the way she treats the children is the hardest part . She does n't want them near her , which they do n't understand . How could they ? They do n't even know they were adopted . The village is due to be planted in rubber trees this coming season . The Olinka hunting territory has already been destroyed , and the men must go farther and farther away to find game . The women spend all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They sing to the earth and to the sky and to their cassava and groundnuts . Songs of love and farewell . We are all sad , here , Celie . I hope life is happier for you . Your sister , Nettie147Dear Celie , Guess what ? Samuel thought the children were mine too ! That is why he urged me to come to Africa with them . When I showed up at their house he thought I was following my children , and , soft-hearted as he is , did n't have the heart to turn me away . If they are not yours , he said , whose are they ? But I had some questions for him , first . Where did you get them ? I asked . And Celie , he told me a story that made my hair stand on end . I hope you , poor thing , are ready for it . Once upon a time , there was a well-to-do farmer who owned his own property near town . Our town , Celie . And as he did so well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he decided to open a store , and try his luck selling dry goods as well . Well , his store did so well that he talked two of his brothers into helping him run it , and , as the months went by , they were doing better and better . Then the white merchants began to get together and complain that this store was taking all the black business away from them , and the man 's blacksmith shop that he set up behind the store , was taking some of the white . This would not do . And so , one night , the man 's store was burned down , his smithy destroyed , and the man and his two brothers dragged out of their homes in the middle of the night and hanged . The man had a wife whom he adored , and they had a little girl , barely two years old . She was also pregnant with another child . When the neighbors brought her husband 's body home , it had been mutilated and burnt . The sight of it nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , was born at this time . Although the widow 's body recovered , her mind was never the same . She continued to fix her husband 's plate at mealtimes just as she 'd always done and was always full of talk about the plans she and her husband had made . The neighbors , though not always intending to , shunned her more and more , partly because the plans she talked about were grander than anything they could even conceive of for colored people , and partly because her attachment to the past was so pitiful . She was a good-looking woman , though , and still owned land , but there was no one to work it for her , and she did n't know how herself ; besides she kept waiting for her husband to finish the meal she 'd cooked for him and go to the fields himself . Soon there was nothing to eat that the neighbors did not bring , and she and her small children grubbed around in the yard as best they could . While the second child was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lavished all his attention on the widow and her children ; in a short while , they were married . Almost at once she was pregnant a third time , though her mental health was no better . Every year thereafter , she was pregnant , every year she became weaker and more mentally unstable , until , many years after she married the stranger , she died . Two years before she died she had a baby girl that she was too sick to keep . Then a baby boy . These children were named Olivia and Adam . This is Samuel 's story , almost word for word . The stranger who married the widow was someone Samuel had run with long before he found Christ . When the man showed up at Samuel 's house with first Olivia and then Adam , Samuel felt not only unable to refuse the children , but as if God had answered his and Corrine 's prayers . He never told Corrine about the man or about the children 's " mother " because he had n't wanted any sadness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I appeared . He put two and two together , remembered that his old running buddy had always been a scamp , and took me in without any questions . Which , to tell the truth , had always puzzled me , but I put it down to149Christian charity . Corrine had asked me once whether I was running away from home . But I explained I was a big girl now , my family back home very large and poor , and it was time for me to get out and earn my own living . Tears had soaked my blouse when Samuel finished telling me all this . I could n't begin , then , to tell him the truth . But Celie , I can tell you . And I pray with all my heart that you will get this letter , if none of the others . Pa is not our pa ! Your devoted Sister , Nettie150Dear God , That 's it , say Shug . Pack your stuff . You coming back to Tennessee with me . But I feels daze . My daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisters no kin to me . My children not my sister and brother . Pa not pa . You must be sleep. 151Dear Nettie , For the first time in my life I wanted to see Pa . So me and Shug dress up in our new blue flower pants that match and big floppy Easter hats that match too , cept her roses red , mine yellow , and us clam in the Packard and glide over there . They put in paved roads all up and down the county now and twenty miles go like nothing . I saw Pa once since I left home . One day me and Mr. was loading up the wagon at the feed store . Pa was with May Ellen and she was trying to fix her stocking . She was bent down over her leg and twisting the stocking into a knot above her knee , and he was standing over her tap-tap-tapping on the gravel with his cane . Look like he was thinking bout hitting her with it . Mr. went up to them all friendly , with his handstuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the patterns on the sacks . I never thought I 'd ever want to see him again . Well , it was a bright Spring day , sort of chill at first , like it be round Easter , and the first thing us notice soon as we turn into the lane is how green everything is , like even though the ground everywhere else not warmed up good , Pa 's land is warm and ready to go . Then all along the road there 's Easter lilies and jonquils and daffodils and all kinds of little early wildflowers . Then us notice all the birds singing they little cans off , all up and down the hedge , that itself is putting out little yellow flowers smell like Virginia creeper . It all so different from the rest of the country us drive through , it make us real quiet . I know this sound funny , Nettie , but even the sun seem to stand a little longer over our heads. 152Well , say Shug , all this is pretty enough . You never said how pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . Every Easter time it used to flood , and all us children had colds . Anyhow , I say , us stuck close to the house , and it sure ai n't so hot . That ai n't so hot ? she ast , as we swung up a long curving hill I did n't remember , right up to a big yellow two story house with green shutters and a steep green shingle roof . I laughed . Us must have took the wrong turn , I say . This some white person 's house . It was so pretty though that us stop the car and just set looking at it . What kind of trees all them flowering ? ast Shug . I do n't know , I say . Look like peach , plum , apple , maybe cherry . But whatever they is , they sure pretty . All round the house , all in back of it , nothing but blooming trees . Then more lilies and jonquils and roses clamming over everything . And all the time the little birds from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees just going to town . Finally , after us look at it awhile , I say , It so quiet , nobody home , I guess . Naw , say Shug , probably in church . A nice bright Sunday like this . Us better leave then , I say , before whoever it is lives here gits back . But just as I say that I notice my eye is staying on a fig tree it recognize , and us hear a car turning up the drive . Who should be in the car but Pa and some young girl look like his child . He git out on his side , then go round to open the door for her . She dress to kill in a pink suit , big pink hat and pink shoes , a little pink purse hanging on her arm . They look at our license tag and then come up to the car . She put her hand through his arm . Morning , he says , when he gits up to Shug 's window . Morning , she says slow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anything I can do for you ? He ai n't notice me and probably would n't even if he looked at me. 153Shug say , under her breath , Is this him ? I say , Yeah . What shock Shug and shock me too is how young he look . He look older than the child he with , even if she is dress up like a woman , but he look young for somebody to be anybody that got grown children and nearly grown grandchildren . But then I remember , he not my daddy , just my children daddy . What your mama do , ast Shug , rob the cradle ? But he not so young . I brought Celie , say Shug . Your daughter Celie . She wanted to visit you . Got some questions to ast . He seem to think back a second . Celie ? he say . Like , Who Celie ? Then he say , Yall git out and come up on the porch . Daisy , he say to the little woman with him , go tell Hetty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kiss him on the jaw . He turn his head and watch her go up the walk , up the steps , and through the front door . He follow us up the steps , up on the porch , help us pull out rocking chairs , then say , Now , what yall want ? The children here ? I ast . What children ? he say . Then he laugh . Oh , they gone with they mama . She up and left me , you know . Went back to her folks . Yeah , he say , you would remember May Ellen . Why she leave ? I ast . He laugh some more . Got too old for me , I reckon . Then the little woman come back out and sit on the armrest of his chair . He talk to us and fondle her arm . This Daisy , he say . My new wife . Why , say Shug , you do n't look more than fifteen . I ai n't , say Daisy . I 'm surprise your people let you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work for him , she say . Live on his land . I 'm her people now , he say. 1 feels so sick I almost gag . Nettie in Africa , I say . A missionary . She wrote me that you ai n't our real Pa . Well , he say . So now you know . Daisy look at me with pity all over her face . It just like him154to keep that from you , she say . He told me how he brought up two little girls that was n't even his , she say . I do n't think I really believed it , till now . Naw , he never told them , say Shug . What a old sweetie pie , say Daisy , kissing him on top the head . He fondle and fondle her arm . Look at me and grin . Your daddy did n't know how to git along , he say . Whitefolks lynch him . Too sad a story to tell pitiful little growing girls , he say . Any man would have done what I done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , then look at me . He can tell she know . But what do he care ? Take me , he say , I know how they is . The key to all of ' em is money . The trouble with our people is as soon as they got out of slavery they did n't want to give the white man nothing else . But the fact is , you got to give ' em something . Either your money , your land , your woman or your ass . So what I did was just right off offer to give ' em money . Before I planted a seed , I made sure this one and that one knowed one seed out of three was planted for him . Before I ground a grain of wheat , the same thing . And when I opened up your daddy 's old store in town , I bought me my own white boy to run it . And what make it so good , he say , I bought him with whitefolks ' money . Ask the busy man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dinner getting cold . Where my daddy buried , I ast . That all I really want to know . Next to your mammy , he say . Any marker , I ast . He look at me like I 'm crazy . Lynched people do n't git no marker , he say . Like this something everybody know . Mama got one ? I ast . He say , Naw . The birds sing just as sweet when us leave as when us come . Then , look like as soon as us turn back on the main road , they stop . By the time us got to the cemetery , the sky gray . Us look and look for Ma and Pa . Hope for some scrap of wood that say something . But us do n't find nothing but weeds155and cockleburrs and paper flowers fading on some of the graves . Shug pick up a old horseshoe somebody horse lose . Us took that old horseshoe and us turned round and round together until we was dizzy enough to fall out , and where us would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shug say , Us each other 's peoples now , and kiss me. 156Dear Celie , I woke up this morning bound to tell Corrine and Samuel everything . I went over to their hut and pulled up a stool next to Corrine 's bed . She 's so weak by now that all she can do is look unfriendly  --  and I could tell I was n't welcome . I said , Corrine , I 'm here to tell you and Samuel the truth . She said , Samuel already told me . If the children yours , why did n't you just say so ? Samuel said , Now , honey . She said , Do n't Now Honey me . Nettie swore on the bible to tell me the truth . To tell God the truth , and she lied . Corrine , I said , I did n't lie . I sort of turned my back more on Samuel and whispered : You saw my stomach , I said . What do I know about pregnancy , she said . I never experiencedit myself . For all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the signs . They ca n't rub out stretch marks , I said . Stretch marks goright into the skin , and a woman 's stomach stretches enough sothat it keeps a little pot , like all the women have here . She turned her face to the wall . Corrine , I said , I 'm the children 's aunt . Their mother is my older sister , Celie . Then I told them the whole story . Only Corrine was still not convinced . You and Samuel telling so many lies , who can believe anything you say ? she asked . You 've got to believe Nettie , said Samuel . Though the part about you and Pa was a real shock to him . Then I remembered what you told me about seeing Corrine and Samuel and Olivia in town , when she was buying cloth to157make her and Olivia dresses , and how you sent me to her because she was the only woman you 'd ever seen with money . I tried to make Corrine remember that day , but she could n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe us and start to feel something for her children , I fear we will lose her . Oh , Celie , unbelief is a terrible thing . And so is the hurt we cause others unknowingly . Pray for us , Nettie158Dearest Celie , Every day for the past week I 've been trying to get Corrine to remember meeting you in town . I know if she can just recall your face , she will believe Olivia ( if not Adam ) is your child . They think Olivia looks like me , but that is only because I look like you . Olivia has your face and eyes , exactly . It amazes me that Corrine did n't see the resemblance . Remember the main street of town ? I asked . Remember the hitching post in front of Finley 's dry goods store ? Remember how the store smelled like peanut shells ? She says she remembers all this , but no men speaking to her . Then I remember her quilts . The Olinka men make beautifulquilts which are full of animals and birds and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to make a quilt that alternated one square of appliqued figures with one nine-patch block , using the clothes the children had outgrown , and some of her old dresses . I went to her trunk and started hauling out quilts . Do n't touch my things , said Corrine . I 'm not gone yet . I held up first one and then another to the light , trying to find the first one I remembered her making . And trying to remember , at the same time , the dresses she and Olivia were wearing the first months I lived with them . Aha , I said , when I found what I was looking for , and laid the quilt across the bed . Do you remember buying this cloth ? I asked , pointing to a flowered square . And what about this checkered bird ? She traced the patterns with her finger , and slowly her eyes filled with tears. 159She was so much like Olivia ! she said . I was afraid she 'd want her back . So I forgot her as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was how the clerk treated me ! I was acting like somebody because I was Samuel 's wife , and a Spelman Seminarygraduate , and he treated me like any ordinary nigger . Oh , my feelings were hurt ! And I was mad ! And that 's what I thought about , even told Samuel about , on the way home . Not about your sister  --  what was her name ?  --  Celie ? Nothing about her . She began to cry in earnest . Me and Samuel holding her hands . Do n't cry . Do n't cry , I said . My sister was glad to see Olivia with you . Glad to see her alive . She thought both her children were dead . Poor thing ! said Samuel . And we sat there talking a little and holding on to each other until Corrine fell off to sleep . But , Celie , in the middle of the night she woke up , turned to Samuel and said : I believe . And died anyway . Your Sister in Sorrow , Nettie16oDearest Celie , Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat , the constant dampness , even steaminess of my clothes , the swampinessunder my arms and between my legs , my friend comes . And cramps and aches and pains  --  but I must still keep going as if nothing is happening , or be an embarrassment to Samuel , the children and myself . Not to mention the villagers , who think women who have their friends should not even be seen . Right after her mother 's death , Olivia got her friend ; she and Tashi tend to each other is my guess . Nothing is said to me , in any event , and I do n't know how to bring the subject up . Which feels wrong to me ; but if you talk to an Olinka girl about her private parts , her mother and father will be annoyed , and it is very important to Olivia not to be looked upon as an outsider . Although the one ritual they do have to celebrate womanhood is so bloody and painful , I forbid Olivia to even think about it . Do you remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I thought I had cut myself . But thank God you were there to tell me I was all right . We buried Corrine in the Olinka way , wrapped in barkcloth under a large tree . All of her sweet ways went with her . All of her education and a heart intent on doing good . She taught me so much ! I know I will miss her always . The children were stunned by their mother 's death . They knew she was very sick , but death is not something they think about in relation to their parents or themselves . It was a strange little procession . All of us in our white robes and with our faces painted white . Samuel is like someone lost . I do n't believe they 've spent a night apart since their marriage. 161And how are you ? dear Sister . The years have come and gone without a single word from you . Only the sky above us do we hold in common . I look at it often as if , somehow , reflected from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your eyes . Your dear , large , clean and beautiful eyes . Oh , Celle ! My life here is nothing but work , work , work , and worry . What girlhood I might have had passed me by . And I have nothing of my own . No man , no children , no close friend , except for Samuel . But I do have children , Adam and Olivia . And I do have friends , Tashi and Catherine . I even have a family  --  this village , which has fallen on such hard times . Now the engineers have come to inspect the territory . Two white men came yesterday and spent a couple of hours strolling about the village , mainly looking at the wells . Such is the innate politeness of the Olinka that they rushed about preparing food for them , though precious little is left , since many of the gardens that flourish at this time of the year have been destroyed . And the white men sat eating as if the food was beneath notice . It is understood by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same persons who destroyed their houses , but custom dies hard . I did not speak to the men myself , but Samuel did . He said their talk was all of workers , kilometers of land , rainfall , seedlings , machinery , and whatnot . One seemed totallyindifferent to the people around him  --  simply eating and then smoking and staring off into the distance  --  and the other , somewhat younger , appeared to be enthusiastic about learning the language . Before , he says , it dies out . I did not enjoy watching Samuel speaking to either of them . The one who hung on every word , or the one who looked through Samuel 's head . Samuel gave me all of Corrine 's clothes , and I need them , though none of our clothing is suitable in this climate . This is true even of the clothing the Africans wear . They used to wear very little , but the ladies of England introduced the Mother Hubbard , a long , cumbersome , ill-fitting dress , completely shapeless , that inevitably gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never been able to bring myself to wear one of these dresses , which all seem to have been made with giants in162mind , so I was glad to have Corrine 's things . At the same time , I dreaded putting them on . I remembered her saying we should stop wearing each other 's clothes . And the memory pained me . Are you sure Sister Corrine would want this ? I asked Samuel . Yes , Sister Nettie , he said . Try not to hold her fears against her . At the end she understood , and believed . And forgave  --  whatever there was to forgive . I should have said something sooner , I said . He asked me to tell him about you , and the words poured out like water . I Was dying to tell someone about us . I told him about my letters to you every Christmas and Easter , and about how much it would have meant to us if he had gone to see you after I left . He was sorry he hesitated to become involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ! he said . But how could he ? There is so much we do n't understand . And so much unhappiness comes because of that. love and Merry Christmas to you , Your sister Nettie163Dear Nettie , I do n't write to God no more , I write to you . What happen to God ? ast Shug . Who that ? I say . She look at me serious . Big a devil as you is , I say , you not worried bout no God , surely . She say , Wait a minute . Hold on just a minute here . Just because I do n't harass it like some peoples us know do n't mean I ai n't got religion . What God do for me ? I ast . She say , Celie ! Like she shock . He gave you life , good health , and a good woman that love you to death . Yeah , I say , and he give me a lynched daddy , a crazy mama , a lowdown dog of a step pa and a sister I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , the God I been praying and writing to is a man . And act just like all the other mens I know . Trifling , forgitful and lowdown . She say , Miss Celie . You better hush . God might hear you . Let ' im hear me , I say . If he ever listened to poor coloredwomen the world would be a different place , I can tell you . She talk and she talk , trying to budge me way fromblasphemy . But I blaspheme much as I want to . All my life I never care what people thought bout nothing I did , I say . But deep in my heart I care about God . What he going to think . And come to find out , he do n't think . Just sit up there glorying in being deef , I reckon . But it ai n't easy , trying to do without God . Even if you know he ai n't there , trying to do without him is a strain. 164I is a sinner , say Shug . Cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But once you find out what 's out there waiting for us , what else can you be ? Sinners have more good times , I say . You know why ? she ast . Cause you ai n't all the time worrying bout God , I say . Naw , that ai n't it , she say . Us worry bout God a lot . Butonce us feel loved by God , us do the best us can to please himwith what us like . You telling me God love you , and you ai n't never done nothing for him ? I mean , not go to church , sing in the choir , feed the preacher and all like that ? But if God love me , Celie , I do n't have to do all that . Unless I want to . There 's a lot of other things I can do that I speck God likes . Like what ? I ast . Oh , she say . I can lay back and just admire stuff . Be happy . Have a good time . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , Celie , tell the truth , have you ever found God in church ? I never did . I just found a bunch of folks hoping for him to show . Any God I ever felt in church I brought in with me . And I think all the other folks did too . They come to church to share God , not find God . Some folks did n't have him to share , I said . They the ones did n't speak to me while I was there struggling with my big belly and Mr. children . Right , she say . Then she say : Tell me what your God look like , Celie . Aw naw , I say . I 'm too shame . Nobody ever ast me this before , so I 'm sort of took by surprise . Besides , when I think about it , it do n't seem quite right . But it all I got . I decide to stick up for him , just to see what Shug say . Okay , I say . He big and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white robes and go barefooted . Blue eyes ? she ast . Sort of bluish-gray . Cool . Big though . White lashes , I say. 165She laugh . Why you laugh ? I ast . I do n't think it so funny . What you expect him to look like , Mr. ? That would n't be no improvement , she say . Then she tell me this old white man is the same God she used to see when she prayed . If you wait to find God in church , Celie , she say , that 's who is bound to show up , cause that 's where he live . How come ? I ast . Cause that 's the one that 's in the white folks ' white bible . Shug ! I say . God wrote the bible , white folks had nothing to do with it . How come he look just like them , then ? she say . Only bigger ? And a heap more hair . How come the bible just like everything else they make , all about them doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing is gitting cursed ? I never thought bout that . Nettie say somewhere in the bible it say Jesus ' hair was like lamb 's wool , I say . Well , say Shug , if he came to any of these churches we talking bout he 'd have to have it conked before anybody paid him any attention . The last thing niggers want to think about they God is that his hair kinky . That 's the truth , I say . Ai n't no way to read the bible and not think God white , she say . Then she sigh . When I found out I thought God was white , and a man , I lost interest . You mad cause he do n't seem to listen to your prayers . Humph ! Do the mayor listen to anything colored say ? Ask Sofia , she say . But I do n't have to ast Sofia . I know white people never listen to colored , period . If they do , they only listen long enough to be able to tell you what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The thing I believe . God is inside you and inside everybody else . You come into the world with God . But only them that search for it inside find it . And sometimes it just manifest itself even if you not looking , or do n't know what you looking for . Trouble do it for most folks , I think . Sorrow , lord . Feeling like shit. 166It ? I ast . Yeah , It . God ai n't a he or a she , but a It . But what do it look like ? I ast . Do n't look like nothing , she say . It ai n't a picture show . It ai n't something you can look at apart from anything else , including yourself . I believe God is everything , say Shug . Everything that is or ever was or ever will be . And when you can feel that , and be happy to feel that , you 've found It . Shug a beautiful something , let me tell you . She frown a little , look out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like a big rose . She say , My first step from the old white man was trees . Then air . Then birds . Then other people . But one day when I was sitting quiet and feeling like a motherless child , which I was , it come to me : that feeling of being part of everything , not separate at all . I knew that if I cut a tree , my arm would bleed . And I laughed and I cried and I run all round the house . I knew just what it was . In fact , when it happen , you ca n't miss it . It sort of like you know what , she say , grinning and rubbing high up on my thigh . Shug ! I say . Oh , she say . God love all them feelings . That 's some of the best stuff God did . And when you know God loves ' em you enjoys ' em a lot more . You can just relax , go with everything that 's going , and praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it dirty ? I ast . Naw , she say . God made it . Listen , God love everything you love  --  and a mess of stuff you do n't . But more than anything else , God love admiration . You saying God vain ? I ast . Naw , she say . Not vain , just wanting to share a good thing . I think it pisses God off if you walk by the color purple in a field somewhere and do n't notice it . What it do when it pissed off ? I ast . Oh , it make something else . People think pleasing God is all God care about . But any fool living in the world can see it always trying to please us back. 167Yeah ? I say . Yeah , she say . It always making little surprises and springingthem on us when us least expect . You mean it want to be loved , just like the bible say . Yes , Celie , she say . Everything want to be loved . Us sing and dance , make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You ever notice that trees do everything to git attention we do , except walk ? Well , us talk and talk bout God , but I 'm still adrift . Trying to chase that old white man out of my head . I been so busy thinking bout him I never truly notice nothing God make . Not a blade of corn ( how it do that ? ) not the color purple ( where it come from ? ) . Not the little wildflowers . Nothing . Now that my eyes opening , I feels like a fool . Next to any little scrub of a bush in my yard , Mr. ' s evil sort of shrink . But not altogether . Still , it is like Shug say , You have to git man off your eyeball , before you can see anything a'tall . Man corrupt everything , say Shug . He on your box of grits , in your head , and all over the radio . He try to make you think he everywhere . Soon as you think he everywhere , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you trying to pray , and man plop himself on the other end of it , tell him to git lost , say Shug . Conjure up flowers , wind , water , a big rock . But this hard work , let me tell you . He been there so long , he do n't want to budge . He threaten lightening , floods and earthquakes . Us fight . I hardly pray at all . Every time I conjure up a rock , I throw it . Amen168Dear Nettie , When I told Shug I 'm writing to you instead of to God , she laugh . Nettie do n't know these people , she say . Considering who I been writing to , this strike me funny . It was Sofia you saw working as the mayor 's maid . The woman you saw carrying the white woman 's packages that day in town . Sofia Mr. ' s son Harpo 's wife . Polices lock her up for sassing the mayor 's wife and hitting the mayor back . First she was in prison working in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the mayor 's house . She had to sleep in a little room up under the house , but it was better than prison . Flies , maybe , but no rats . Anyhow , they kept her eleven and a half years , give her six months off for good behavior so she could come home early to her family . Her bigger children married and gone , and her littlest children mad at her , do n't know who she is . Think she act funny , look old and dote on that little white gal she raise . Yesterday us all had dinner at Odessa 's house . Odessa Sofia 's sister . She raise the kids . I1er and her husband Jack . Harpo 's woman Squeak , and Harpo himself . Sofia sit down at the big table like there 's no room for her . Children reach cross her like she not there . Harpo and Squeak act like a old married couple . Children call Odessa mama . Call Squeak little mama . Call Sofia " Miss . " The only one seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Squeak 's little girl , Suzie Q. She sit cross from Sofia and squinch up her eyes at her . As soon as dinner over , Shug push back her chair and light a cigarette . Now is come the time to tell yall , she say . Tell us what ? Harpo ast . Us leaving , she say. 169Yeah ? say Harpo , looking round for the coffee . And then looking over at Grady . Us leaving , Shug say again . Mr. look struck , like he always look when Shug say she going anywhere . He reach down and rub his stomach , look off side her head like nothing been said . Grady say , Such good peoples , that 's the truth . The salt of the earth . But  --  time to move on . Squeak not saying nothing . She got her chin glued to her plate . I 'm not saying nothing either . I 'm waiting for the feathers to fly . Celie is coming with us , say Shug . Mr. ' s head swivel back straight . Say what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me .

I thought you was finally happy , he say . What wrong now ? You a lowdown dog is what 's wrong , I say . It 's time to leave you and enter into the Creation . And your dead body just the welcome mat I need . Say what ? he ast . Shock . All round the table folkses mouths be dropping open . You took my sister Nettie away from me , I say .

If you had n't tried to rule over Sofia the white folks never would have caught her . Sofia so surprise to hear me speak up she ai n't chewed for ten minutes . That 's a lie , say Harpo . A little truth in it , say Sofia . Everybody look at her like they surprise she there . It like a voice speaking from the grave . You was all rotten children , I say . You made my life a hell on earth . And your daddy here ai n't dead horse 's shit . Mr. reach over to slap me . I jab my case knife in his hand . You bitch , he say . What will people say , you running off to Memphis like you do n't have a house to look after ? Shug say , Albert . Try to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shit what people think is a mystery to me . Well , say Grady , trying to bring light . A woman ca n't git a man if peoples talk . Shug look at me and us giggle . Then us laugh sure nuff . Then Squeak start to laugh . Then Sofia . All us laugh and laugh . Shug say , Ai n't they something ? Us say um hum , and slap the table , wipe the water from our eyes . Harpo look at Squeak . Shut up Squeak , he say . It bad luck for women to laugh at men . She say , Okay . She sit up straight , suck in her breath , try to press her face together . He look at Sofia . She look at him and laugh in his face .

She go git the water , put it by his plate , give him a peck on the cheek . Say , Poor Daddy . Sit back down . You not gitting a penny of my money , Mr. say to me . Not one thin dime . Did I ever ast you for money ? I say . I never ast you for nothing . Not even for your sorry hand in marriage . Shug break in right there . Wait , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us too . No use in Celie being the only one taking the weight . Everybody sort of cut they eyes at Sofia . She the one they ca n't quite find a place for . She the stranger . It ai n't me , she say , and her look say , Fuck you for entertaining the thought . She reach for a biscuit and sort of root her behind deeper into her seat .

And it seem like , going to Memphis , Grady was all over the car . No matter which way us change up , he want to sit next to Squeak . While me and Shug sleeping and he driving , he tell Squeak all about life in North Memphis , Tennessee . I ca n't half sleep for him raving bout clubs and clothes and forty-nine brands of beer . Talking so much bout stuff to drink make me have to pee . Then us have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves . Mr. try to act like he do n't care I 'm going . You 'll be back , he say .

But what you got ? You ugly . You skinny . You shape funny . You too scared to open your mouth to people . All you fit to do in Memphis is he Shug 's maid . Take out her slop-jar and maybe cook her food . You not that good a cook either . And this house ai n't been clean good since my first wife died . And nobody crazy or backward enough to want to marry you , neither . What you gon do ? Hire yourself out to farm ? He laugh . Maybe somebody let you work on they railroad . Any more letters come ?

She take one look at my face and say Celie ! Then she turn to Mr. . Stop Albert , she say . Do n't say no more . You just going to make it harder on yourself . I 'll fix her wagon ! say Mr. , and spring toward me . A dust devil flew up on the porch between us , fill my mouth with dirt . The dirt say , Anything you do to me , already done to you . Then I feel Shug shake me . Celie , she say . And I come to myself . I 'm pore , I 'm black , I may be ugly and ca n't cook , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Amen , say Shug . Amen , amen. 176Dear Nettie , So what is it like in Memphis ? Shug 's house is big and pink and look sort of like a barn . Cept where you would put hay , she got bedrooms and toilets and a big ballroom where she and her band sometime work . She got plenty grounds round the house and a bunch of monuments and a fountain out front . She got statues of folks I never heard of and never hope to see . She got a whole bunch of elephants and turtles everywhere . Some big , some little , some in the fountain , some up under the trees . Turtles and elephants . And all over her house . Curtains got elephants , bedspreads got turtles . Shug give me a big back bedroom overlook the backyard and the bushes down by the creek . I know you use to morning sun , she say . Her room right cross from mine , in the shade . She work late , sleep late , git up late . No turtles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statues spread out round the room . She sleep in silks and satins , even her sheets . And her bed round ! I wanted to build me a round house , say Shug , but everybody act like that 's backward . You ca n't put windows in a round house , they say . But I made me up some plans , anyway . One of these days . . . she say , showing me the papers . It a big round pink house , look sort of like some kind of fruit . It got windows and doors and a lot of trees round it . What it made of ? I ast . Mud , she say . But I would n't mind concrete . I figure you could make the molds for each section , pour the concrete in , let it get hard , knock off the mold , glue the parts together somehow and you 'd have your house. 177Well , I like this one you got , I say . That one look a little small . It ai n't bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a square . If I was square , then I could take it better , she say . Us talk bout houses a lot . How they built , what kind of wood people use . Talk about how to make the outside around your house something you can use . I sit down on the bed and start to draw a kind of wood skirt around her concrete house . You can sit on this , I say , when you get tired of being in the house . Yeah , she say , and let 's put awning over it . She took the pencil and put the wood skirt in the shade . Flower boxes go here , she say , drawing some . And geraniums in them , I say , drawing some . And a few stone elephants right here , she say . And a turtle or two right here . And how us know you live here too ? she ast . Ducks ! I say . By the time us finish our house look like it can swim or fly . Nobody cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning and go to market . Buy only stuff that 's fresh . Then she come home and sit on the back step humming and shelling peas or cleaning collards or fish or whatever she bought . Then she git all her pots going at once and turn on the radio . By one o'clock everything ready and she call us to the table . Ham and greens and chicken and cornbread . Chitlins and blackeyed peas and souse . Pickled okra and watermelonrind . Caramel cake and blackberry pie . Us eat and eat , and drink a little sweet wine and beer too . Then Shug and me go fall out in her room to listen to music till all that food have a chance to settle . It cool and dark in her room . Her bed soft and nice . Us lay with our arms round each other . Sometimes Shug read the paper out loud . The news always sound crazy . People fussing and fighting and pointingfingers at other people , and never even looking for no peace. 178People insane , say Shug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can last . Listen , she say . Here they building a dam so they can flood out a Indian tribe that been there since time . And look at this , they making a picture bout that man that kilt all them women . The same man that play the killer is playing the priest . And look at these shoes they making now , she say . Try to walk a mile in a pair of them , she say . You be limping all the way home . And you see what they trying to do with that man that beat the Chinese couple to death . Nothing whatsoever . Yeah , I say , but some things pleasant . Right , say Shug , turning the page . Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton Hufflemeyer are pleased to announce the wedding of their daughter June Sue . The Morrises of Endover Road are spearheadinga social for the Episcopal church . Mrs. Herbert Edenfail was on a visit last week to the Adirondacks to see her ailing mother , the former Mrs. Geoffrey Hood . All these faces look happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear and innocent , like they do n't know them other crooks on the front page . But they the same folks , she say . But pretty soon , after cooking a big dinner and making a to-do about cleaning the house , Shug go back to work . That mean she never give a thought to what she eat . Never give a thought to where she sleep . She on the road somewhere for weeks at a time , come home with bleary eyes , rotten breath , overweight and sort of greasy . No place hardly to stop and really wash herself , especially her hair , on the road . Let me go with you , I say . I can press your clothes , do your hair . It would be like old times , when you was singing at Harpo 's . She say , Naw . She can act like she not bored in front of a audience of strangers , a lot of them white , but she would n't have the nerve to try to act in front of me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't bring you to Memphis to be that . I brought you here to love you and help you get on your feet . And now she off on the road for two weeks , and me and Grady and Squeak rattle round the house trying to get our **30;10047;TOOLONG were lying for courtesy 's sake . Nosy would have called the look insincere . When it was just the opposite . The boy 's eyes were that extraordinary Kurdish blue . Some mountain infiltration , way back when ? Though one would n't lightly imply Kurdshipto a Bakhtiary-Pahlevi , except in family teasing . He began to remember the protocol , every item of which , the old man had said , had a desert reason . " Like our obsession with roses and fountains , " he 'd said , in his stiltedly perfect-spoken English . Slang he only wrote . " You AngloSaxonshave the same , Beel . Climatic habits , I mean . Once , in the long vac , while I am at Harrow , I am invited to a school friend 's family in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me why English parliamentarianshave that sheep-snuffle . Or why their wives neigh like mares . ... You must have the same cause and effect in America ; what would they call it there  --  print-out ? " Bakhtiary was always subscribing to dictionaries of slang and obscure academic publications , as well as to dozens of the little magazines , cultist bulletins and pulp rags he called " Yo-yo . " " Because after a time , it does n't bounce . " He loved all the new American euphemisms , the new graphs , as the fresh green evasions of a civilization reluctant to examine itself  --  " Dangerous , not to , yes , but it happens to you people every time . " Why did n't he come to the States and see for himself ?  --  Wert had often written , but this was never responded to . Just as for some years now  --  ever since the tenth anniversary of their meeting , on which date Bakhtiary had sent him a spray of the same small green sherbet-colored orchids he 'd sent to the undertaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill 's wife . " Ought to get rid of that German stuff , " Wert said . " Ca n't do you that much good at the UN . " Or not with us . " Father says the same . " " What 's your post there ? " " Oh , quite insignificant . I am what you call  --  underfoot . To learn . " Which might mean either that the clan had n't been able to buy him in  --  or that he was being groomed for the top . " Vielleicht  --  what is the English for that , Mr. Wert ? " " Perhaps . ' " " Pairhops . No . Purr . . . haps . R-right . " The son was making a steeple of his fingers as children did , with the thumbs serving as portcullis , or door . Opening these slowly , he looked in , spellbound . " Purr-haps it was your last letter from my father , Mr. Beel ? " He closed the thumb-doors , crushing the steeple to fists . " It was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the single-breasted jacket that bound him so perfectly , a buttonpopped . " Why did n't he ever come over here ? " Wert burst out angrily . " He went everywhere else . " " He never tell you ? " " No . " " That it was because of me ? " " No . But I suspected it . " " Something bad , you thought . " Wert could n't answer . His eyes stung . So for Bakhtiary Senior , no more of that tumbling exchange-bazaar of ideas  --  stopped now at the pen , stopped at the throat . Yet stipulating roses all the way , in the senses left to him . Wert remembered planning , years back , how he would take Bakhtiary south , to Athens , Georgia ; they 'd have understood him there . " Nothing bad , Beel . I assure . " The boy 's eyes shone their improbable color . Devotion , in a blue mosque . " I will ask when I see him . If I can tell you . If I can speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , smoothing it , blew his nose . " Sorry . I get these irrational angers , these days . All my emotions seem to turn into them . " " And you are only forty-six . " " He did tell you everything . " Wert put out his hand , was able to smile . " Can I help ? " " But you have help already . Wirklich . Only because of my mission to you  --  am I allowed home . " " Mission ? Thought you were just passing through . " " I see at once you will be too angry . When you walk in . " So this vague , rancid choler he could n't shake must be plain to all  --  in his gait , his gesture , probably even the flushings of his skin . Like those men clowned by drink , whose veined noses marked them . " What is it ? Your  --  mission . " In his mind he was already telling Nosworthy . One of those little corruptions , would it be ? They had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since standards were simply not the same . As the old man had smilingly pointed out to Wert early , moral standards on both sides were impossibly high  --  but in reverse . Would Wert be asked to use his " influence " precisely in some area where he could n't imaginably either have it or exert it ? Like getting a failed candidate for Oxford by , hook or crook past the examiners , and in ? Or persuading the Victoria &; Albert to part with a piece of thep232national treasure  --  at a fine price of course  --  to some avid tycoon in Teheran ? Where the university itself would have done the Bakhtiarys any favor , and maybe the museum , too . It would n't be anything military ; that drama had long since been transferred to the corporations , in the open style learned from the West . No , it would be some amusingly human exchange , which , for the Bakhtiarys not to perform for the cousin or uncle who craved it would be a breach of the highest family faith . Or it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fealty requiredsoared altogether out of sight . Wert would n't be asked anything directly connected with his job . Nothing small , that is . " I have two missions , " Manoucher said . " One  --  to get a sweater set , size forty-eight , for my mother , at Harrods . " He snapped his fingers , grinning . " Accomplished . " " Yes , the pound may be down momentarily , now and then . But thanks to cashmere , never quite out . What 's the other ? " Young Bakhtiary pressed his hands to his vest , looking up . It was an English vest  --  and ceiling  --  but Wert fancied that behind the vest 's wearer he could see the sky in Meshed and smell the sulfur tinge of those winter afternoons when some celestial vegetable seemed to be comfortably burning , while a luminous-eyed young crony , backing himself up against the wall of Wert 's study , recited stanzas nominally addressed to the Five Gates or the Tortoise River , but just barely grazing these loci of history with personal allusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Waiting for persuasion by all hands to help him through ; which was ritual . After which everybody glowed with tea , and went out into the dusk convinced of human glory , and his own part in it . It had been a marvelous way to spend an afternoon . Only the grudgingwould see it as one more of those late-marrying young males ' substitutesfor sex . These days Wert himself could n't persuade a flea of anything ; he was tired of any of that , dejuiced of all early generosities , or ardors , and resigned to his own sex substitutes of the moment  --  a late-melting publovenow and then , or more recently , a brisk smartener with a woman barrister who 'd had her wrenchings also . By now he knew that a life spent in " tours "  --  the departmental phrase  --  had a way of putting the most colorful present into the past , almost as one experienced it . Meanwhile , a single man whose general job classification  --  Cultural Attache  --  might often mean exactly the opposite , could take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and often brightly renewable , especially on leaves home  --  since by now hisp233sophistication on other countries was endless , and his own people , tired of innocence , were well ready for it . But how tired he must be , to sink with such gratitude into these cushiony Middle-Eastern pauses , where there were stanzas of time between thoughts . As in the days after Jenny 's death . " Mr. Beel ? " He sat at attention . Importances often strung themselves along a man 's life in the same recurring style , often with the same people . " My father ask you tell me the history of that day . Of your meeting , " he said , as if coached . " The day at the Danieli . " " Please ? " " Name of the hotel . " " Pardon . We were in maybe twenty hotels that year . " " Um . . . Excuse me  --  I do this for you ? " Manoucher thought , gravely . They had postures for it . " Us . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country he was in , a habit he disliked but could n't shake . Blame it on a tenderness toward the foibles of far places and peoples , which gripped him the minute he stepped over their borders , making the host people his always excusable darlings and him their surefooted interpreter . When young this had made him briefly valuable at his job ; now there was danger of its tabbying him ; in his line , the men who went to the top were not the sensitives . Already this talent for observation may have cost him his nativity . For when he went home on , leave ( where if confrontedas now he should be saying " Bro-ther " or " Kee-rist " ) that other stance persisted . He was always faintly explaining Americans over his shoulder to a savage interlocutor who could only be himself and who gave them no quarter  --  tenderness to the foreigner not being involved . " Let me see  --  " He meant to exhaust all his own pauses . Meanwhile running over the possibilities . Could the dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bowl of roses as was his wont , have become convinced of a heaven of confessive therapy for all ? Nonsense . They never even pushed Islam , except politically . To them , all the other garden-of-Allah Islam doctrine was already consonant with the existent world . Or else the rest of the world was n't worth the conversion . Or not to Bakhtiarys . No , it would be something practical , within the terms of what friends do for one another ; the old man always insisted that Wert had done a lot . Could it be that after all these years they still thought that Wert had some actionable claim  --  against the city of Venice and its non-pavings ?  |p234Or  the Lambretta cycle company , for making what it did ? A couple of the older men in the Bakhtiary household in Venice had had an even odder expectation  --  that the State Department would surely compensateWert for the loss of his wife , either by finding him another or furnishing him the wherewithal for a richer one . These two had even argued which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the household , who knew that Wert by now understood almost everything in that language , watched him . Old Bakhtiary had had one of those countenances made powerful by skin-disease surmounted ; the pocked skin had stretched all-of-a-piece over the heavy features , a fine hide , worsting time even in the ceremonialpicture sent Wert two years ago , when the old man had had a medal for state services unannounced . In the dim Italian voltage , the beard under the shaven cheeks shone dark green . Whether or not from his lack of skin mobility , Bakhtiary had only one facial expression  --  a dignifiedalertness to advantage , so steadily held to that one never had any clue as to his immediate acts . But as to his approving any long-gone claims  --  again nonsense . All the man 's actions were immediate  --  though performed with an air of ageless calm . The waiter was asking whether Wert and Manoucher wanted coffee in the lounge . Beyond , the mai'tresse watched him and Manoucher with a care not all duty ; yes , she was Wert 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably clever enough beyond her station to be companionable , maybe arrested by class difference but not crushed by it . Not at all likely to be one of the poignant ones Wert could n't take . " Tea , " Manoucher said . " I 'll have tea . " " A sweet ? The trifle is good here . " Wert was recalling those Venetian pastry wallows in which the male and female halves of the Iranian household had most nearly converged . The men , arriving one by one or in pairs , had indulged themselves patriarchically , as if they were doing this for the home , as perhaps they were . Clustering at the samovar , lacy tidbits in hand , they looked the more virile for it . The same physical heightening occurred when they leaned intensely over flowers , sometimes over a single bloom , or swarmed almost scholasticallyto examine a fresh bunch of freesias or iris . Extending into what in other countries might be the woman 's sphere , and often in the most delicate attitude , their blunt masculinity seemed only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way that assailed Wert , abashed him and could never have been explained at home . Giggles would come meanwhile from the women , eating too , behind a screen which the hotel had supplied . A sense of their family lifep235exuded through its wooden lattices  --  of deferential girls , black-eyed swans barely out of the nursery , waiting to enter some other harem of family women whether they were to be the one wife or not ; the older women were the go-betweens . In Bakhtiary 's house in Teheran the women 's quarters had still been separate ; even in the relaxed hotel version Wert had seen how the day consumed itself for both sides in dozens of rumorous back-and-forth domestic transactions , beneath which the sexual , a blank to outsiders , must be explicit to all . Courtship , even for those of his young cronies in Tabriz and Meshed who 'd been at university , and for the girls , just beginning to attend , whom Wert had glimpsed there , unveiled by then but black-dressed , off by themselves and still giggling  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groom of an arranged but delayed marriage occupied the engagement period in elaborate romanticizing to his devoted male friend . The girl would be always with women , presumably taking in whatever midwiferyand suggestive passion she could over pistachio-sprinkled macaroons  --  beingurged to more whipped cream and filliped toward a man all in one . When girl and man finally met and coupled in the hot , honey cake dark supplied them , did they speak ? Manoucher , hesitating , was feeling his girth . He , too , saw the maitresse , and lowered his eyes . " No thank you , no dessert . Three months , and I am already getting the marriage-fat . " " Your father wo n't approve of that . " " I have to send pictures , every month . " Wert laughed . Everybody in Teheran knew the story of Manoucher 's mother and father . Old Bakhtiary , having left his country as a young man " to see the world , " had lingered mainly in Paris and other chic corners of France , until he was sixty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had returned home " To found a family . " In the year after the heir was born , when both parents had grown connubially fat , he proposed to his wife that they take a thinning cure at one of the spas known to him during his long golden youth . She , strong-willed as he , had to his surprise refused either to leave home for foreign uncertaintieswhich might unseat her , or to grow thin  --  which both he and she apparently equated with modernity and the West . He had forced her to Switzerland anyway . It was rumored that she had then done the unheard-of  --  refused marital relations . The old uncles of the traveling household , however , blamed her later infertility  --  for which Bakhtiary had dispossessed her , on her weight . In any case she 'd had no more children . The second wife , the old men had said contemptuously , was thin enough  --  from having only girls.  |p236It  could n't matter much with the third wife  --  not for long . " Your father has the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn about ours ; he 's always mocking it . " How much laughter there had always been around him . In his company , the younger Wert had felt pugnaciously in command of life and its golden days  --  with a good swathe of both still in prospect . Even now , whenever one of the letters came Wert saved an evening , dining alone over it in the **25;10079;TOOLONG flat he 'd subleased from a transferred colleague who 'd had a fancy wife . " Decoration by Heals , " the lease agreement said . " Not to be tampered with . " A while back Wert , moved to satisfy the old man 's charmingly voracious interest in the lives of others  --  or in Wert 's life  --  had sent him a picture of the sitting room 's coffin-slim couches and starved , sculptural drapes . The following Christmas he 'd been sent an enormous domed-brass brazier , centered in a multicoloredcircular comforter thick as eiderdown , under which an entire peasant family could lie old-style , feet pointed toward the coals . Since when it lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any woman he brought home . " Not you , Mr. Beel ; he never mock you . " Again the scrutiny , so strong it raised the nap on him . In the lounge , Manoucher parted his mustachios over the tea . Just so tea had been drunk in Meshed , the young cronies in their badly cut blazers , bending in obeisance to the ark of friendship as if an invisible imam had given the signal , their intense eyes brimming over the cup at Wert , the host , at each other , in adoration of the situation of kinship , focused on the samovar whose cobalt flame they could carry anywhere . Sons-of-generals working as Embassy clerks , shy teachers who 'd never before rubbed elbows with those except through this foreign host of theirs , and that one young poet to whom all deferred  --  Wert could never have explained to them how frail friendship was in America . In the red-velvet night clubs of Teheran at the time they could have seen the U.S. version of it in the executives and technicians of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backslapping , sometime thing . Wert had later brought his samovar out with him along the roundabout route he had traveled home , scooping up the last sights of a country in which , still a tyro , he 'd thought he might have left behind a life . Rocking with him in the plane over the Elburz range , cradled on a bus seat along the Caspian and flying again over the desert-bordering bazaar cities in one of whose crucibles it maybe had been made , this bronze , crenellated pot with charcoal crumbs still in its belly , such an elaboration for boiling water merely , and indeed falsely stamped withp237the Russian imperial crest as so many were , seemed to him a concept he was bringing out with him , although when finally disposing of Jenny 's effects he 'd sent the thing itself to Jenny 's parents in Illinois . By that time , Bakhtiary 's letters had begun , and he 'd had no further need of it . His coffee cup clicked against his teeth . I know what I am to this boy-man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from cubship . I 'm a bequest . Or I 'm going to be . It 's been decreed . I 'm to be young Manoucher 's old friend . " What can I tell you ? " he said , leaning forward . " Our story ? It was n't much . " In Manouch 's hard blue gaze and just perceptible headshake he saw that it was . Or it flowered there , as he himself spoke . " We met in Manila , Jenny and I , my second tour . My first , as you know , had been in Iran  --  Tabriz , Meshed . In Manila , she was working for the Filipino professor who was our Fulbright Commission liaison . " An idealistic girl from Antioch , she had hobnobbed with the young Filipino intellectuals who published The Literary Apprentice , teaching them Martha Grahamrhythmics on the side and tangling too ardently with their antiAmericanpolitics . " She was helping picket the American Embassy when I met her . A sailor of ours who 'd killed a Filipino national had been sent home for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roe case  --  in the light of the Marcos regime , what ancient history it was . It had been a period when all Southeastern Asia was hung with the lanterns of exchange scholarship , as if it was nothing but a ruddy international tea garden  --  and Vietnam had been only one more place . " Maybe she married me just in time . " Dressed in one of their Maria Clara blouses , a high-shouldered embroidered trifle which he 'd ultimatelysent home , too . " We were married at the Embassy . " With a wedding lunch at the Overseas Press Club where , as Jenny had written her mother , they 'd had custard-apple ice cream , and a group of dancers had done a dance of stepping over bamboo poles , called the tini-kling . " Venice , where I was sent shortly , was really our honeymoon . " Living at the Danieli with other departmental couples in an expense-paid suite whose governmental arrangements dated from World War II , they had been part of an almost communal life which might well have seemed normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , my father tell , " Manouch said tenderly . " Four months . And such a pretty girl . . . he see her . On her motorcycle ... I did not see her . But all our women talked of it . " " Middling pretty , " Wert said . " One of our  --  girls . Nothing out of thep238ord  --  " Though sometimes in bed , in that silly-soft gilt gondola , as he leaned over that thin profile of hers , which was like a slash of indelible ink on the afternoon-shadowed sheets , the breasts like two small invertedcups , and the patch of pubic hair he and she had called her " mouse , " he 'd actually felt his heart stop , wondering if love-embolism could kill . " She should n't have been on a motorcycle at all in that city ; I do n't know how they sanctioned it , really . But she worked for the consulate , a kind of courier . " And in those days the whole world was deferring to our American machine-style  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doe-eyes . " She was so proud of knowing all the streets she could use it on  --  a whole backyard network . Sometimes she had to part with it , though , and use a vapo-retto . " One noon he and she had run into each other on one of those , and putting a finger to her lips she 'd flirted with him until he picked her up , to the siropy outrage of two well-dressed sixtyish signoras behind , who kept Cara ! - ing each other like machine guns . Cara , can you tell which of the Americans are whores ? I never . Answer : Psst , Cara . Maybe they all wear yellow , like the putanas in Russia . When all four were getting off , Jenny , who was wearing yellow , turned to them , saying in Italian , " He 's my husband , we 're going home for siesta . " Everybody laughed like crazy , and they all ended up for a drink at where the signoras had been heading  --  Harry 's Bar . Where it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hats one of them had made , clicking their bracelets , gradually removing an arsenal of cigarette holders , lipstick cases and other frippery from their handbags , and being persuaded by table acquaintancesto take orders on all of them . Cara Marcella , cara Tonia ; he remembered them yet  --  and how , when Jenny 'd said to him , I parked the Vespa on the Zattere , they 'd rolled their eyes at each other . Chic ! Nobody ever stole the motorcycle , no matter where she left it . Probablythe whole of Venice knew whose it was , she 'd said , giggling . " Such privilege , ai n't it orful , " she 'd sighed . " And four months ago I was a radical . " Seriously discussing their progress , they 'd both concluded they had n't yet compromised on any principles . But they 'd meant to keep a sharp lookout . " She 'd only exchanged the trusty old Vespa for the Lambretta that day . " Wert 's thumb pressed his teeth : " She had n't wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lavish embassy style . And the order had come through . My darling old Vespa , she 'd sulked  --  couldn'tp239we keep it somewhere ? " If she 'd been riding the old one , maybe  --  But it was junked . " " No it was n't . " Manoucher sat up . " The hotel head porter salvage it . My father buy it from him . For me . It go all over Europe with us , for years . Our gardener in Teheran has it now . " He pushed the tea away ; China tea meant nothing to them . " You see , you were so romantic , to us . Both of you . So young . Together  --  in a marriage . So dashing . And no children .... To the women especially , she was . And so odd . Riding that machina like a horse . Astride . " He was reddening . " And in those thin clothes . " The flush deepened . " I was still with the women . When they heard that  --  sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not allowed to look . Never . But I already hear it was n't the same machine . I used to sneak out to where she kept the old one . The porter let me . " The old Vespa . And Wert had kept nothing . Not even the samovar . So romantic they were  --  and so practical . The porter must have been bribed ; Wert remembered him . A bow for the Americans , but for the Iranians almost a salaam ; he 'd probably been on their retainer the whole time . Which had n't prevented him from being the first to run out from his little office and pick up Jenny , or the doll bleeding from the nose that she 'd become . Such thin , gauzy stuffs she wore that steaming summer , that day a green-and-red dress , picked up for a song at those stalls near the synagogue in the ghetto , which fell from her waist in points like a handkerchief . No helmet ; in Italy then nobody did . She 'd loved the way Italian men on foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bella until with a wave she outdistancedthem . " Yes , the women saw it , " Wert said . " And ran to your father . When I came in from the office for lunch , not fifteen minutes later , he met me at the door . He did n't want to let me talk to the women  --  but not because of your customs  --  not at all . He led me in there , when I asked . " He 'd never forgotten the sight of that group of women , their veils rimmed beneath their eyes , clinging to each other in bas-relief , or as if in these quarters which they never left singly , some daily applied nougatpaste kept them even from moving their limbs separately . One of them , on command from Bakhtiary , had been persuaded to drop her veil for Wert , giving her account . " The cobblestones spat her up , " she said , to her husband , not dreaming Wert knew Farsi . " High in the air , with her place showing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If she 'd worn chador like us , " the woman said , meaning the shawled wraps , without which in spite of the heat there , these women never left theirp240rooms , " maybe the head would have been spared . " Then like one of the Fates she 'd raised a draped arm and shut her face from Wert 's sight . Once outside again , the old man  --  if one could call him that as the spry septuagenarian in a silk suit he was then  --  had apologized . " Fateh sours , from only having girls . " When they went back to Wert 's room and saw the Italian doctor in pince-nez and black ribbon , leaning over the pillow and the fall of hair on it , as in one of those Victorian lithographs  --  " A Medical Call "  --  old Bakhtiary had dropped on one knee slightly in front of Wert but still linking hands , so that Wert , forced down with him in that Christian posture , stayed for a minute there hand in hand , staring at the backs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that he could go nearer . There Jenny was  --  or was n't . In the silly gondola bed . " Does your father still have shoes made to his own last in Jermyn Street , and then wear down the backs of them like carpet slippers ? " he said smiling , and stopped short . Manoucher was again staring at him in that bug-eyed , Coptic way which made one realize that all the frescoes , from Persepolis to Greece to the Pyrenees , stated a simply observed physical resemblance . " What  --  what . . . ? " Wert said , and stopped short . How much of this conversation had been said aloud . How much only thought ? And for how long had he been speaking in Farsi ? " Ye-es . " Across the dinky cocktail table Manoucher took Wert 's hand and held it . Wert let it stay . The ill-lit lounge was occupied only by one other couple and a foursome , all of them British and busy at it , and the club was after all  --  thespian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? As if he was reporting on glory , a small tincture of it . And that Manoucherknew . " She was so terribly nice , you see , " he said in English . " Jenny . So  --  nice . And so terribly  --  " Close . The pacts they had had , the jokes  --  all so interwoven . Jenny had n't fenced him in by dying ; she 'd left him irresponsibly freer than he 'd meant or hoped to be . She and he had meant to keep such a sharp lookout . " Do you have a picture , Beel ? " " No . I kept nothing . Except something your father gave me , after-wards . " " She is a dark-haired , my father say . With a good white skin . And features not dick . " His tongue made an effort . " T-thick . And she sometimeplay Fur Elise ' on the hotel piano . " " Mendelssohn 's Spring Song . ' "  | " He say she does not have the blond nose American . Like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pug . Wert burst out laughing . This time the English people did look up , and away . " More like this , " Manoucher said , making a two-fingered aquiline line on the air . " Not quite . A slight wave to it . Like this . " Wert guided him . " There . " He sat back . He felt nearer that bed than he 'd ever dared go since . " Actually , she was n't that other kind of American , but one generation only . Her folks came from Bulgaria but were Armenian ; her maiden name was Arkanian . " " So . " The eyes glowed . " Now 's there anything else your connoisseur father would like me to tell you ? " Like : height five foot six , waist small , weight I du n no , have a try at one-twenty , shoe size seven  --  large . And a head with a great cave-in from which a cockade of brain protruded . Bakhtiary , who measuredall women , had n't seen her at her best . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it . " Manoucher threw up his hands . " Promise you will not be angry , " he said in Farsi . " Please believe me . My father requests for reasons most serious . " The Farsi word was actually nearer " real " as Wert remembered . Or real-to-life . " Yes ? What ? " Manoucher leaned toward him , a forefinger raised like a priest 's . " Be sure to ask him , ' he said on the phone . ' I forgot to . I trust you to , Manoucher . I can trust you to the end of the world . Have n't I done so ? ' Manoucher took time to smile at himself holily but Wert still could n't help liking him . Loving him was nearer the truth . " Go on , then . " " What was the color of her pubic hair ? " When Wert did n't answer , young Bakhtiary stood up . Wert stood also . " This wedding of his  --  must have addled him . " " I could wish it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . " Tears rise so readily to their large , already moist eyes , Wert thought , but is that bad ? They went out to the entrance and got their coats . The doorman handed the red-faced , almost blubbery Bakhtiary his coat , but helped Wert , whom he knew . Or because Wert was senior . Outside , the London evening glittered like channel water , always a puzzle to him how the nights here shone so , with so little light ; must be the wet . Through the portico they could hear this most obsequious doorman in town , out on the steps now , letting in a latecomer . " Guu-udeevunning , sah  --  " like a wipe-down from a masseur . But if you asked to hire him or his wife to masticate food for an old man , they'dp242have you up at the assizes . What was enlightenment , that it could patronize a young man for the tear in his eye ? " I get it , " Wert said hurriedly . " I 'm his bequest to you , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy 's shoulder , higher than his own . " I 'll do my best to act like one . " The eyes above his veiled . When they were about to take refuge in oratory , they often lowered their eyes like this . To let you know . " It is my father 's nature . To make gifts . " All of their natures . The cronies had come arms laden to the train on which Wert left Meshed , though he 'd been there scarcely a year . " Come back , " they said knowingly , more to this year out of their lives than to him , for they must have known he would n't . Raining on him pictures they had taken six months to paint , silver ashtrays marked with their own names , they had wailed it : Come back . He should have sent flowers to Manoucher 's hotel even though the wife was n't with him ; perhaps he still should . The sexual allocation of flowers meant nothing to them ; there was a ritual . Not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sacred , irrecoverable time which had been between them . " Have you a picture of your wife ? " He should have asked at once . He was proffered it . He took the thick cardboard to the light . Odd how in the Middle East they still managed these nineteenth-century photographs , with that same cold purity of line which used to come from plates which took hours of soaking to develop  --  and a long time to pose for . In Tabriz he 'd seen ancient German tripod cameras . Though perhaps in this case it was in the purity of the sitter . On a polished white glare the head of a handsome girl perched in cameo . If that huge space between the eyes was n't touched up  --  no , they had n't minimized the thick brows  --  she must be beautiful , even with a mouth so severe . The glare was n't entirely from the paper . " Soraya . " " Soraya . " Like the Shah 's former queen . Whom it had n't been polite to mention . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she , too , sixteen ? " " She is twenty-four . " Manoucher looked him straight in the eye . " Ah , Jenny 's age , " Wert said too quickly . But very late , for them . Or used to be . In fact the respective ages of both were all wrong . Or more like us . " Will she be joining you over there for your father 's wedding ? " " She stays in your country . To make the house . " A German-style one , by the stern lift of that face ? The Iranians had always admired German expertise.  | " We are married only three months . " " Still time then , " Wert said , knowing these jokes were in order . " To make him a grandchild . " Oh he was trying . This time he knew he was speaking Farsi . Manoucher put the picture away in an inside breastpocket . He had clouded over again . " She is  --  Universitat graduate . " " Ah . . . so you met there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was years out of date on modern Iran . He should have asked Manoucher to meet him in the bar ; maybe , in spite of the Koran , they knocked back their scotch like anybody  --  maybe the two of them should go for a nightcap even now . " No . I never meet her there . " " Ah . You were engaged to her before . " Before he was sent away . But would even that explain the age of the girl ? " No , I never meet her . She say she think she see me once , somewhere from far away . Before I leave Iran . But until she see me the wedding day , she is not sure . " Manoucher put on his overcoat . Preening ? Yes , a little . " It was I. " " Do you mean  --  ? " Of course it was meant . A young man five years away in the raw city they all wanted to conquer . But where girls were merely met . A boy who was important enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'd said . If you were all that and a learner too at the Western arena where for all their public scorn they carefully sent both their richest money-splashing aristocrats and their finest talk-dragons , no , you would n't take just any wife . Amazing how they could act from conventions thousands of years old and still appear inventive . Confidence did it , roiling in this boy 's veins as bright as blood . The " boy " was fastening his overcoat , regally . The doorman rushed to adjust its collar , receiving his tip by a sleight-of-hand so fast Wert only knew of it from the man 's face . Manoucher nodded , standing tall . " I write my father , yes ? And he send her to me . " Just then the maitresse appeared . In the umber light of the old entranceshe came toward them on neat feet , all the time seeming to move deferentially backward . Her gold watch swung from her blouse on its rose-velvet bow-knot , pinned to her collar , not to her breast , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know her place . Yet the gold chains , which he now saw ended in a bunch of functional keys at her waist , stirred in reverse , faintly sexual . In her hand , held out to Wert , was Manoucher 's button , the one he had popped . Wert took it and passed it on . liakhtiary kissed her hand.  | " Mrs.  --  Vrouman . " Wert was n't after all surprised he remembered her name . These things had a way of storing themselves up for him . " My  --  godson . " Surely no member had ever introduced her before . She took it prettily . Perhaps she 'd never before brought any of them a button either . " Vrouman  --  " Wert repeated . Though the " Mrs. " might well be complimentary , in the same way that the British dubbed their cooks . " I had fancied you yourself were Viennese  --  " They exchanged looks . He had fancied . She noted it . " No sir , I 'm Dutch . " She left , thanking them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalled the English would call her  --  a manageress . Until he glimpsed , in the kissed hand trailing behind her , a clutch of bills . He laughed . " So you noticed her , too . " Manoucher joined in . Out on the steps , " Gu-gude night , gentlemen , " rolled down them like suet . " Shall you have a cab ? " " There are no cabs anymore and you know it , " Wert blurted . Ashamed of himself at once , he passed the doorman a coin . " Where you staying , Manouch  --  the Savoy ? My car 's down the alley . I 'll drive you there . " " The Dorchester . " His eyes glinted . Of course . Islam had bought it . And miraculously , here was a cab . What 's it doing , creeping up to them from where it had been waiting ? Marvelously gleaming cab  --  the cabbie had a cloth still in his hand . " ' Ere you are , guvnor . " Allah had dispatched him  --  having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hire for one night , belonged to Manouch . Wert pressed his hand . " I 'll be in New York shortly . Shall I speak to your wife ? " " I will not yet be home . But call on her , " Manouch said in Farsi . " Please . " " Of course , " Wert said , in English . " My mother is with her . " " I always wanted to meet that lady . " " She knows all about you . Also , there is the other wife . " Manoucher 's teeth , suddenly shown , are magnificent . " My father 's , Mr. Beel .... But Soraya does not like it . " " Ah well , two mothers-in-law . " But should n't an Iranian girl  --  a girl who would still submit to being married as this one had  --  be used to such leftover polygamous households ? " My mother and the other wife , they tell everyone in Teheran theyp245come to New York to wait for our child . Except my father . They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is n't yet a child , " he said , gloomy . " Manouch . Only three months . " " And if Soraya  --  if there should not be , I could not tell him , " he said distractedly . Suddenly he is a wild man , pulling at his tie , raking his hair . " Manoucher . Why not ? " Had n't she been a virgin ? Wert dared not say it . " Manouch , control yourself . " It was what one crony back there had said to another , after the story of love unrequited , love hopeless , and more usually , love untold . He patted him . Manoucher straightened his tie and hitched at the overcoat . It was polo-cloth color and cashmere , or maybe even vicuna , and the longest , thickest and no doubt lightest ever seen . No Briton had tailored it , no New York one either . A French expatriate from Algiers maybe , sodden with hashish . " Even it should happen  --  I do not tell him until his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the sugary tones with which they said We are speaking the truth , you will understand , but not the truth . " That is his time ; he should not be  --  worry-ed . " Only this last word being in the English in which Wert had continued to answer him . The thought of that ninety-year-old , spry in mind as he was , on his wedding-deathbed , being incantated over , tossed ribbons and chocolate , going through it , however it would be done , only to have the door closed at last on both his exertions and his suffering  --  it should n't bear thinking of . Why instead should Wert feel that he himself , for all his panoramas , had n't yet had a life ? " I suppose . " " We have our reasons , Mr. Wert . Always . Like you do . " Young Bakhtiary 's voice is cold now , adult , remote . Not a godson 's . What it says is : We know all the nuances . And now  --  would you like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's reasons then . Why for instance hewould want to ask me that most extraordinary . . . personal  --  " Bakhtiary bowed his head , almost all the way to his vicuna breast . " But you ca n't say . You 're not allowed to . " A headshake , violently yes . " Enough . Enough . " The boy might break his neck . Even the cabbie was staring . The doorman , of a higher caste , has turned his back . " Weddings  --  " Wert said . " I had only one of them . " The boy raises his head . How he does alternate his ages ! " When we marry , we also give- gifts.  | " Do you . " He was thinking of Jenny 's " mouse , " tangled wet with both their fluids , and so long now in its body 's grave . If there was a grave . When he 'd wanted to have his family ring , which Jenny always wore , buried with her , old Bakhtiary had whispered : " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persisted , had removed the ring himself , while the Venetianundertaker emitted a shocked Catholic sigh . " Son "  --  Bakhtiary had said in English  --  " grave-snatchers , do n't you see ? What do you bet this man has a connection ? In fact  --  " he 'd said , switching loudly to Italian , " in Venice you can scarcely bury at all . Perhaps you want to send her and the ring home . " Wert could have done that through the Department , and with flags , too , but instead left her in Venice , ringless . Later , sending the ring via Bakhtiary 's kind offer to take care of such details for him  --  to the cousin in Georgia , who , awakened one morning by a solemn Iranian on her doorstep , had never got over it . Bakhtiary had had the ring delivered by hand . " Well , whatever he wants of me , he shall have , " Wert said . " Tell him  --  that it was black . The mouse was black . " For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocked , smiling sadly . " Thank you . And bless you . " They embraced , kissing cheeks . After a moment , Wert leaned on the cab door . " Shall I bring over your mother her sweater set ? " he said in English . Manoucher grinned . " Already done . " And probably by hand . " I 'm loathe to let you go , " Wert said , the old Farsi formalities liquid in his throat . " You can see , my dear friend , that I do n't want to . " He stood aside for Manouch to get in the cab . " Give your father my eternal love . " In Farsi it was easier . " Tell him I keep his letters always . And the copy he gave me of the Gulshan-i-Raz . " " He gave you  --  that ? " When Manouch was caught off guard , the mask made by the mustache faded . One saw the man behind it . " I shall send it to your first son . " The boy sat back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stuck his head in the cab . " Manouch . The child will come . And in time , maybe , to have your father see the  --  what will it be ?  --  the one hundred and seventieth of his line ? " " The seventy-sixth . He exaggerates . " Was the kid smiling ? No , but the man was . " Right . Still , you 're the seventy-fifth . To an American , that 's  --  what 's your New York address by the way ? " A card was slipped to him , bearing more numbers on it than he 'd ever seen on one address . " Where 's that ? " " Queens Boulevard . "  |p247They  burst out laughing again . That used to happen  --  instant double laughter with the father . Who 'd once said , Perhaps we two should be in oratorio . " Thank you , " Manoucher said . " For the mission . You can not weiss how much . " Wert closed the cab door . The cabbie gave a last slap to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' Ave n't the time for a cleanup on the usual . " He swung himself in : " Except I get one of these blokes .... The Dorchester , mi-ind you . Soaking in oil these days . Roight ? Tally-o ! " Inside the cab , whose window was open , Manoucher , dark and erect , said no word . Wert drove home roiled with emotion . Landscapes of it were passing one another in his breast , which must have been empty-ready for them . Meshed , Manila , Venice , and Athens , Georgia  --  as seen through Jenny 's eyes . Teheran  --  though he 'd never seen Bakhtiary there , or ever again since Venice . And Queens Boulevard , which he had n't yet seen . In his youth , some such interweaving was what he 'd come to the Department for . Yet he could no longer see himself making any new moves for the future among these scenes , even though he had no thought of leaving them . Other people might be kindling to new passions , or like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But these days Wert waited for others to set things going ; his own letters to Bakhtiary had said as much . Very liberating it had been , never to get a moral reply , and few direct ones . By the time they got around to answering each other 's thoughts , these had faded gratefully past the contemporary . Any application to living could no longer be made . He meant to take out the box of letters and begin rereading backward , down to the first , under which reposed the red morocco box Bakhtiary had given him after the funeral  --  opened then and never since . It contained a small white , plaster death-mask of Jenny . " One can get anything made in Venice , " the old man said . " Better than a gravestone . One day you can break it . But not now . " Driving home , he began to be irked by the way the Bakhtiarys , father and son , were involving him . Not with their own private lives , which in spite of all the elegant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were a serious friend , they would keep looping your own life around your neck , hanging it on you to confront you with it , as with the box , whose purpose had been : " Mourn now . " Wert parked the car again just off Kensington High , walked into the square where his Hat was and entered the pub almost directly opposite ,  |p248glad  that he was in England where , having had so much of the real poetic thing , they 'd developed antidotes for it . Neither a limbo nor a place to let go altogether , the Hartsdale was a spot where , though he was known , he might sit and consider his friends without having to acquire more of them . It was n't yet ten o'clock ; he and Manoucher had dined early . He sat over a shandy , considering much , then went to the telephone , dialed the Garrick , and when it came on asked for Mrs. Vrouman . A female voice , presumably the kitchen 's , answered : " She 's gone for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice to give him her home phone ; should that tell him something ? At the home number , a much superior female voice asked him to hold on , called out , " Helene Vrouman , Mrs. Vrouman , " came back to ask , " You 're not her mother 's nursinghome ?  --  ah , good , " and without fuss dealt him another number where he could reach her . He was further convinced of the woman 's prospectively tidy cool ; he admired the Dutch . It always pleased him to find women of whatever class who pursued their solitary way with sure , businesslike steps  --  almost as if , had he been the one to die early , Jenny would have become one of them . Cleaving through life neither remarried nor a mere widow-pensioner , and with a certain quiet personalradicalism  --  though by now emotional only , not political . The third telephone number had a familiarity he could n't place . He dialed it . " Dorchester , good evening , " the phone said . Crossing the road to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They ought to be members of the Garrick , all breeds of them . Somewhere on the telephone boards a few tumblers had clicked , and here he was with more knowledge than he ought to have  --  small change as such details were these days . Mrs. Vrouman  --  a woman who did instead of did n't , which he 'd sensed already  --  might fade back now into the collage Wert had made of her , only forgetting the roll of bills , folded perhaps around a calling card . But Manoucher  --  who would n't stay a boy any longer , and whose missions either in Iran or in New York might therefore not be a boy 's  --  troubled him . He was glad of his own flat coming up  --  in spite of its black-and-whiteness so comfortably chaired and bedded that he could always sleep off any ambition there . And so acceptably not his . In the front areaway he passed the sturdy , smutted hedge which never grew . Then came a flight of the spruce stairs he much preferred to a lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would be a fire laid pridefully high by the char whose away-all-day gentleman treasure he was ; each night he lit it , a happy arsonist . On a lean marble table in thep249side hall he would find mail and packages brought in by the porter , who was old enough to love a lord and to settle for an American . A bottle of Bulmer 's cider was always ready beside his turned-down bed . No messages in his box . How did irritation enter in ? Through what cracks ? What he first thought he saw was a white furred arm reaching out from the grate and up past the mantel ; then he saw the flowers on it , crusting thickly . He turned on a lamp . A potted plant the size of a small tree stood in front of the fireplace , one long dazzling branch arching toward the ceiling , then dipping gently to trail its blossom fingers almost in his brazier . Between that and his landlord 's plinth-like marble tables there 'd obviously been no place to set the plant down except on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but on the table lay a ticket which said just that  --  No Card  --  from a shop just where he thought it would be  --  in back of Park Lane , near the Dorchester . If he knew anything about Iranians , the pot would be special too . He knelt . It was . Thick putty-colored ware , calligraphed with early indigo , manganese purple and eye-blue , the kind of pot one saw only in museums or mosques . Or should . Sometimes there was a rare flush of pink on them . He touched it , half smiling . A lesson in how to send an unbribable deputy-ambassador  --  alegal pot . He drew the curtains and turned on every light in the sitting room , rather as he did when he brought a woman here . To assure her of what was here and what uncozily was n't  --  and for later , to be able to turn the lights out . The plant was as tall as a girl might be ; its buds and flowerets were unknown to him . By now he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . He was aware , for instance , of those beaky bird-of-paradise blooms which in Southern California grew outside any dusty insurance office but in New York lorded it over the tables of flash restaurants  --  and that his mother 's favorite , the true American Beauty rose , seemed no longer to exist . His cousin liked freesias , which were available around her birthday . From an earlier time , there were garden sweetpeas , and those gardenias one had sent girls . This great spray of brown bark and flushed white must come from a fruit tree , or what once had been one , tamed now to a shrub . Not apple , and not so pink as the cherry blossoms in Washington . He had an idea it was n't from any of the places where London got its hothouse supply either  --  the Scilly Isles , Kent . Algiers , maybe ? Gibraltar ? Crouching on his heels , he leaned forward . Wound around the plant stem was a coil of what he could identify  --  those same tiny tree-orchids of spotty tiger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they'dp250meant to retire to , before the blacks ' unrest . " Who 'd have thought it of Jamaica ? " Nosy had said , last time Wert went for a visit . " I tell you who should have . Us . " Nothing had rousted Nosy 's gloom , certainly not when Gail had said , " But Nosy dear , how could we have known ? We never had a tour remotely near . " He went to get his bottle of Bulmer 's from his bedside and sat down again in front of this plant , or tree , with that strange wreath at its base . It was perfectly possible Bakhtiary had arranged for this flamboyant bouquet , maybe even to be made to some exotic specific from the Gulshan , which translated meant Rosebed of Mysteries . He saw Bakhtiarylaughing up his sleeve  --  if his throat , in which the cells themselves must be spreading like fantasy , still allowed that . Hell . Who else could have sent that pot ? An hour later , finished with all the cider in the fridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He seemed to himself to have lived always between two parallel tracks which , as far as he could see into future snows , were still separate . On the one hand , human nature was the same the wide seas over . Yet on the other hand , everywhere on those seas , and clinging to the gravels and fjords as well , there were clumps of people cohesively different . This was why the world did n't work out , and he had a job . The big spray of fleshy blooms quivered now and then in a chill current which came from an unshuttable register ; the British never really wanted to understand central heating , but like his old hotel in Manila , where the showers had been present but unconnected  --  they now provided it . Because of this inconveniently precious pot on his hearth , he could n't have the fire he preferred . It had taken over his sitting room , a warning . Its givers meant it so ; he knew them . Never press a moral ; give a gift that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And never confer a favor without first asking one , so that the one given may be acceptable . What favor were they going to ask  --  or confer  --  on him ? Weddings  --  the evening had been full of them , all airborne on the breath of Bakhtiary 's rportality , under that jaunty boast of his , " I shall smell roses all the way , " which one had only to cut shorter to see the meaning of : I shall smell . As your jenny had , by nightfall . As one day  --  you . This branch dipping its gentle tip into his gift brazier  --  was it a rose ? Named for a woman , as roses often were , or for queens ? There must be a whole generation of girls named for that deposed queen whose picture used to be in every palace and hut . Like Manoucher 's Soraya , on whom he must call . Those tenacious tree-orchids , he hadp251seen their like long before . That tenth anniversary bouquet sent him by Bakhtiary had been made of them  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All of this was being done with their dreadful literalness . What was he being led through this evening , like a man wearing a blindfold it was time to drop ? Women  --  the whole evening had been made to murmur suggestively of them . He was being urged to marry of course . But in all this sickly-sweet barrage there would be some steely hook of the practical . He was as sure of this as that he was now staring at an eighteenth-century pot identical with one long ago admired in Bakhtiary 's quarters at the Danieli . Its replica  --  in an artbook of their national museum 's treasures , which had been propped up behind it  --  was as Bakhtiary had said quizzically , " out on loan . " What the hook would be he could n't prefigure , any more than he could dispose of this particular pot by sending it home to his cousin . He had the letters , which might help . Last week 's was on his mantel . " One must learn from the physical , " Bakhtiary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . " Anticipate he must . Or wait to be embroiled ? What saddened him now was that he had a year of grace to find out what he was targeted for  --  about the same time as Manoucher had , to produce a son . With the help of that wife . Even makers-and-shakers like the old man had to wait for grandsons ; who knew but that with the help of the little girl from Ardebil he was hanging on for just that ? Or to see Manoucher safely into harbor somewhere . Both , more likely . And in the rhythm of their ways , Wert too would have to wait with them . Because he was to be a legacy : " To my beloved son , Manoucher , for use in the profession he has nobly chosen : One tame diplomat , carefully cultivated . " Wert laughed . The flowers stirred . If that thing had been a woman instead , its nearest rosy tip could have picked his breastpocket , or put a token there . He felt ashamed , a recent habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their like could spend a lifetime treading the waters of feeling with  --  a friend . In turn , they were friends beyond any shape of friendship Wert was likely to find at home . Certainly not with Nosworthy , whose only real allegiance , after the Department , was to his wife . As Bakhtiary had once commented , this was often the case with the Americans . " We are still very Elizabethan in my country , Bill , " he wrote , " in more ways than one . Have you noticed ? " No , he 'd have to read up on the Elizabethans , Wert wrote back , privately marveling at how his own slapdash education was being returned to him  --  from their side . Sometimes he did have the scholarship , and then his own brain wasp252picked exhilaratingly . What had this senior friend , compared to whose lineage even this pot 's was new , ever really asked of William Graham Wert of Athens , Georgia , scion of only four known generations glossed by one part-time brigadier general ? Only a correspondence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weep into his cup  --  a picnic mug marked St. Ives , left over from a weekend with the she-barrister . When young , he and Jenny had wanted to learn from existence what things were proper to weep for . Only with Bakhtiary had he continued that pursuit . The mug shot from him , but being of thick ware rolled oafishly on its side , where it did have a look of its round donor when she had her legs in the air . He 'd had a pleasant enough time between them . Do n't asperse that shingle she can hang out , either  --  her name scripted in black-on-cream , high on a fine law-court door . Given the temper of the times at home , he might well soon have need of the kind of advice she could supply from behind a desk , with her legs strictly together . " Everybody'snow sunk in dollar-shame , for which somebody else must suffer , " Nosy had reported . What if that bloody intractable , wise , sweet , and wily ninety-year-old should leave money  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , Wert ? He was going to be given something inconvenient . He could feel that for sure . On matters of state , Bakhtiary always addressed him formally . " You understand us so well , Mr. Wert , " he had written once . " I hope your employers appreciate it . " Nosy had paused over that letter , too . " Very complimentary . And what did you answer the old guy ? " Wert had written back , taking the trouble to underline , My country appreciates it . Nosy 'd slapped him on the back for that one . " Tough is n't it , to be friends with any other national ? There was a Frenchman once . I 'm not Catholic , but I was to be godfather to his first child . His wife kicked up a rumpus clear to the Vatican . Where her uncle was a cardinal . . . . And I was just coming in , you know . Would n't do . " " Just after World Wqr Two was it ? " Wert had asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Department then , the last romancers of war . " Right . And before Gail . " NosWorthy had picked up again Bakh 's little disquisition on coitus . " Right you are , Billy me boy . Keep ' em on sex . That keeps everything straight . " That damn plant hiding his hearth made him angry . He knelt in front of it . The pot , a vase really , had been affixed to a modern base made of their overbrilliant silver . They thought nothing of cramming the centu/ries together however hideously . Born knee-deep in the beginnings of world art , they could well afford to leave mere taste to the parvenu West . He put his arms around the great chill vase , and by alternately tuggingand creeping backward managed to inch it safely over and off the raised fender . Waxy buds pressed him , warm and resilient ; not a one dropped . He was being resisted . Over a shoulder he saw that the plant 's highest arch had gracefully entangled one of his landlord 's rapier lamps . Ile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His hair was raked ; a waft of bloom entered his ear . Once , in his teens , he 'd marched in a hometown parade wearing a holstered flag which had continually streamed back over its bearer in a tussle the whole laughing town had been watching ; this felt the same . He went down on his heels again , pulling . There . Done . The tree , for it was surely that , now half-barred a door , but one could brush past . By its scent , which seemed to come from both their exertions , yes , it must be a rose . Perhaps he ought to give it a drink . In his bedroom he found the carafe on the night table freshly filled , although his good char , swerved off routine by the arrival had forgot to turn down the bed . Selfishly , he stood in the doorway and drank the water himself , watching the addition to his household . Maybe best to let it die , while he was in New York , with the char off duty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obligation enough . That was the least a conscientious bequest could do . Being one  --  and he meant to be decent  --  was chancy enough . While taking all care not to be annexed . At home , friendship died when its generation did , but with them , maybe because they had so many more generations to look back on , its obligation rested ever heavier on the young . In Meshed , one of the consular clerks , an older man with a family , had been nearly bankrupted from supporting a widow with family , no relation , because of an obligation inherited from his own father . What Wert had to guard against might be Manoucher 's supporting him  --  with favors impossible to accept . With a persuasion as mild and patientas their water buffalos used to be . If ever a man was marked by son-ship , that was Manoucher . He began laughing again . The tree did n't seem to mind . That pot must have heard a lot of laughter during eighteen years with old Bakh , and after God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrigues in which somebody got the knife , rope tricks in which prisoners were hoisted to oblivion . Nowadays of course , the perpetratorswere westernized  --  which to them meant merely : Your na/tion had better manage its misdeeds more openly ; the world is looking at you . In the Danieli , he used to visit their suite daily , with the sun streamingin gaudily on the fine Tabriz rugs they had laid over the hotel carpet , and the women walking past him barefoot to oil the rugs naturally  --  thoughoutdoors they affected French shoes which peeped back and forth from each enveloping chador as if there was a second and extra-retiring woman within . Fifty years ago or less , he might have had to have his balls cut off before he was allowed inside the door  --  or would have had his tongue cut out afterward . Once , there 'd even been voluntary eunuchs ; their power in public affairs had been so deviously great . In the old days , maybe they 'd have sent him one . To brush his clothes , brew him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose state papers suspiciously free of lint  --  and perform certain services for him when he could n't sleep . As eunuchs had done for the women , it was said  --  for when wives accumulated , a wise husband kept them content . All the habits of the world probably persisted somewhere ; there were no " ancient " ones . Pity Jenny could n't know . He got up , and tiptoed  --  God knows why  --  into the dressing room , where he refilled the carafe and returned with it . Very gently he tested the water in the pitcher with a forefinger . Museums were humidified . The pot felt ice-cold . Delicately as a curator attending a papyrus , lightly humming under his breath and yet restrainingan impulse to pour in instead the rest of the brandy , which was one-hundred-proof Metaxas and sure plant-murder  --  he watered the tree . Whistling , he lit the char 's pretty coal-castle with his usual pleasure , then sat suddenly back on his haunches . He 'd been messed with that 's what . Interfered with in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yearning whistle again . Orioles flew out of a nest in Georgia . His young wife to-that-date had never seen one . She 'd had two musical calls with which she 'd summoned Wert , birds , the family , the world . This one , which he 'd just whistled , the motif from Das Rheingold , had belonged to her relationship with a previous man , and she 'd worked ineffectually to get rid of it . The second , not a whistle at all , she was very proud of , as the most exotic of her collection of street cries  --  the cry of the man who 'd been selling hundred-year-old eggs the night she first came to Wert 's hotel in Manila . Bal000-ch . Ba-l000ch . A gray voice , it had been , smearing through the four o'clock morning grayness , selling what Wert still thought of as a gray egg . Though he'dp255never seen one , he knew of its rumored properties . " An aphrodisiac , " he 'd cuddled Jenny closer to say , she as pink as a bonbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were gray as well . At daylight , two hours from then , she would squeal at the sight of the headless shower in his bathroom , but that was still to come . The cry outside was weird and yet consoling , a seller even at this hour , hawking known medicine for our ills . " For old men , " Wert said to her , over her . Not for young men , growing in a woman 's hand like a root , even at four in the morning . Yet the seller had persisted outside their window ; maybe he 'd seen Jenny come in . Calling the properties of his wares proudly as a proverb , the man kept on , while they 'd climbed to orgasm and fell moistly . Bal000-ch . Ba-a-looch . Wert called it aloud , inclining his ear . Yes , he still did it better than she had , which had annoyed her . Such anthropology was to have been her specialty ; it was to have been the way a diplomat 's wife who refused to be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 'd had a sibling 's rivalry with him even then  --  not for what he could do , but over the general spoils of life . In time would this have grown on her like those calloused spurs on the heels of women who wore shoes too short for them ? In ten years time , eighteen , which would bring them up to now , with her hair still clipped as boy-short as then , when it had looked like Paris , but on the more massive headline of a middle-aged woman where it might now look like Illinois , and with his own hair maybe falling below the ears in what in London had been a " Chesterfield " but back across the water had become closer to **30;10106;TOOLONG  --  yes , he could see the two of them . Especially if they 'd had no children , as agreed . She by now ever louder in company over what she did , he by now the **26;10138;TOOLONG all in one , ever quieter over his own accomplishment , now that rivalry had faded , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her company a man who might have felt better about that accomplishment than he did standing here , after the years without her . He could see it all quite coolly now . A man who , whatever , might one day soon have need of that hundred-year egg . The fire was burning handsomely . The rose tree , if that 's what it was , did n't yet seem to mind . Soon though it would surely need a tropical humidity , and more than the attentions of even a very good char . In all dispassion he must get rid of it . Getting properly rid of the pot itself would he harder . Of ' course he was being messed with out of friendship , too . In the black and white of his rented house the liakhtiarys , father and son , grewp256toward him , the old one and the young , forming three-dimensional and real from that long bas-relief behind them , the great backwall of polite nuance to which they had been kept . When both sides knew it was shadow play , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real . That pair was going to . Why could n't he guess how ? When he already knew what his answer would be . It would be the one he 'd been trained to give whenever the East-West balance was upset that way ; it was given every other day , internationally . He would be the first to call them uncivilized . And to feel ashamed afterward ? Of them and himself ? " How there are friends ! " Jenny had exclaimed over tea and cakes the afternoon of the morning he 'd met her . " How there are friends in every place . " That morning , he 'd been sent out onto the Embassy 's steps to deal with the daily picket line on the Roe case  --  or rather , with the Americans on it . " Send young Wert to talk to them , " the deputy ambassadorof that post had said to Wert 's superior ; " He should know how to talk to them ; he 's just out from home . What else are these young sprouts they 're sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first tour , Wert already had been silently instructed on what would and must happen to him . Ideals were never mentioned , or why the young sprouts like him kept coming on , once upon a time only from the " better " universities and families , now from almost anywhere in the States , in tune with the democratic  --  ideal . Each of Wert 's older colleagues had at some point of intelligence or temperament recognized what his own first struggle had had to be : to remain , throughout all the motley years of foreign seductions , what they knew themselves to be when at home . In their native land ? So it was in the songbooks maybe , when they were there . But to us out here , the young Wert coming out to be tested told himself , it was Home  --  where no " natives " were . Out on the Embassy porch there was something squalid in the sunshinethat wetted him almost as soon as he stood there . He 'd worn the lightest-weave American shirt made , a tropical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a tailor make him a suit of the local silk , which was permissible , and cheap , but he would not descend , ever , to the barong , however elegantly embroidered  --  a shirt so cool and transparentthat it showed the under-arm tufts and chest hairs of all men to be virtually the same . In every post he would learn that there were certain native garments which accepted the climate beyond where a man like him could follow . Southerner though he was , the heat seemed fetid to him because of the conditions beneath , which he 'd by now blunderedp257into like any ordinary observer  --  squatter-towns not yards from these clean steps , where naked babies crawled like red-eyed larvae ; there was a city of squatters inside the cathedral itself . Soon the archbishop would pay them to remove themselves , for which bounty they had come . When they left , others would replace them . " We have to be at the end of the rope to bring our families here , " a man inside there had said to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's earthquake temblors and had more than once been destroyed , had recently experienced a new crack , extending into the sacristy , the chancel and under the statues around which this man 's family and others had grouped a front line of sturdy wooden creates which said whisky whisky whisky in black letters , and might have come from the Embassy itself . Behind these they lived , on dun tickings spotted with the yellow salve of living . The priests sometimes came to spray for the lice that got into the pews . The man 's wife had scurried to hide a pot warming on a Sterno can . " It 's a holy place , yes -- but  --  " The man 's shrug was clearer than his English , learned as a boy here in the " American " war . Only the intellectuals here called it the Japanese one . Or those who were hangers-on at the Embassy . " And the marble is cool , " the man said . It was midday of what was said every month to be the worst month , and Wert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ayra  --  deeshun , ayra deeshun ! " the man said , shaking a spread hand up , up to the vaults above , with a smile that included all cracks . A priest walking the nave stopped to watch Wert slip the man a coin . Nosworthy , at Wert 's side , watched , too . " What 's it mean ? " Wert said when they were out of there . " Ayra deeshun . A sort of Jehovah wills it in Spanish ? " Nosworthy , who was sometimes called Uncle in the Department because he was Uncle **26;10166;TOOLONG in every dependable fiber , had blatted like a goat . His eyes looked tired , though ; newcomers were sent to him to be told what to think , and it weighed on him . " Air conditioning . " On the picket line in front of the steps that afternoon , Wert saw Fernando Diaz , the tall , handsome graduate student who edited the university newspaper which had started the outcry , and Bony Cristobal , a talented writer soon to be barred from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , Wert had had drinks with the two of them , and sitting between them , a tiny incendiary girl with pearly , projecting skull-teeth , who had seemed to belong to both of them , but only politically . They relied on her for the anti-American remarks . After each one of ' these she closed her lips or tried to , then let them recede gurnward , turning to each of her companions like a pleased dog.  | " Why do you bother with us ? " Wert had said . " We 're out of here , officially . Soon we 'll be phased out altogether . " Fernando , who was as well read as anybody like him at home but wrote lavender verses which seemed to have little to do with either his mind or his sex ( they all wrote , whether they were radicals , poets or medical students like the girl ) , said : " You people have been in the Philippines fifty years ; you 're in our blood and we hate you for it . " Rony , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than Tagalog . Better than Spanish . Tell me  --  do I write in it ? No , do n't tell me . I 'll write in it  --  and I 'll get nowhere . I wo n't deserve to , maybe . . . So I 'll write in Tagalog , which is supposed to be my language . And I 'll get nowhere . " At least we 're not responsible for your Spanish , Wert had thought , but had n't said ; how could he ? Yes , get out with the young ones ; we have to know how they think , Nosworthy had said to him . The girl leaned forward , about to snap at him . Above her pearly muzzle the nose was a tiny sepal of flesh , pulled . " You people are in the world 's blood . " And miraculously , her lips had closed . So , out on the sunny steps he had come , that afternoon . Or had been sent . His being there meant nothing  --  a ritual . Just the daily courtesy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one had been a cultivated man who believed in talk , real talk . Nosy 's version of the uses of talk was that it served but need n't mean anything . Wert on the steps still believed with that other ambassador . " Understand their courtesies ; use these . They 'll weep at the sight . Just so you do n't , " Nosworthy had said . " And it lets them let off steam . " Still , out there hatless and exposed on the steps , Wert felt himself to be an emissary  --  and likely never to get over that feeling . " Always remember , " the briefer in Washington had said , checking Wert 's orders : " Wherever you are , you 're us . " And wherever we are , are we the world ? He had n't believed it , even then . It was after five , and the streets of the central town were filling everywhere with ant-crowds arrived from all the crevices , not all of them young but predominantly so ; by seven o'clock the streets would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets and stalled the cars  --  a hegira trotting neat and purposeful , knowledge-bound . It was the hour when the universities let out , or their evening sessions began . Hundreds of universities , most of them private , Nosy had said . " And those size-two girls with flowers in their hair , do n't let them fool you  --  nurses , doctors , dentists , biologists and all the rest . And the men  --  two professional degrees , three  --  even if you 're going into daddy 's bank ... more especially of course , if you 're not . . . Look down there . '  |p259They  'd been in a hotel that night , the highest night spot in town , with the bay below . As many times as Wert looked at Manila Bay , whether it smiled with breakfast sweetness at the false front of tourists lodged along its shore , or sullened with black , peppery rains which vanished forward like motes into steam , he always saw it squawking with the triangulated flames of war , or jigging white and black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that came after gunshot or before . He never knew which war he was looking at , Admiral Dewey 's little take-over , or that later spectacular whose winners were now leaving . " Look , " Nosworthy said . " Dewey Boulevard 's hard enough to cross at best . The whole Orient 's jammed with students . But do n't you worry . Over here they 're good little boys now ; they 've learned their lesson . It 's all for  --  " Rubbing his right thumb on forefinger and middle one , he made the immortal money-sign . " It 's no moral rearmament . " So he , Wert , had come out on the steps , but not as to battle . Only to give the picket line the message they 'd been given yesterday and would expect tomorrow . That the ambassador had taken cognizance . And would convey their message . To the proper authorities . The plaza was really very crowded ; it was hard to say which students were on the line and which only on their scholastic way , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one turning could confuse even an old resident . In colder cities the poor could n't rubble up a hovel right next to a Riviera-style hotel , as they had near Manila 's main one . Or , like last week , appear one morning in the rear slop yard of an Embassy which had n't bothered to plant anything there  --  fourteen peoplematted together in sleep , or in the copulations which produced the round-headed babies lying everywhere among them  --  all with the diseasesor hidden starvations that linked them bone to bone . That first morning , seen from the Embassy 's back windows , as the sun glinted on an exposed cheek or bodice or the white sole of a child 's foot , a chickenchatterof wakefulness ran through the pile of them . " A heap of people , I 've never seen one , " a staff girl said , and fainted ; then the mound down there gurgled and opened , maggoty face after face , saw the Embassy people staring from the office above and folded again , inching over each other but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no pipe . They had stayed on for days ; a democratic ambassador could take no cognizance . A few of the office girls , led by the one who 'd fainted , began leaving the people-in-the-back their own lunchtime sandwiches of bologna or peanut butter bought at the PX market , where they were allowed to buy supplies along with the military . The courtyard people ate whatp260they understood to be food , but left the rest . Their own leavings , of scavenged parings and rice thrown out by restaurants , grew ever larger ; their garbage-hungers required refuse by the bale . Then the rats came ; maybe a baby was taken . One evening , in the dusk of the rainy season , their shusha-shusha rose more excitedly to the typewriters clattering up above . In a fog hung with neon , they were humping themselves together again , consolidating around some provincethey had lost . Again the whole office went to the windows to watch . Slaglike , they moved on , and out . Next morning , an Embassy aide was sent to order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gardens . Just to be sure , the aide , a smart cookie with a will to do for ambassadors what they could n't on their own , chose a cactus furred with a delicate web which entered the skin like nettles  --  and the Embassy'sslop yard was at last sown . " Greetings , Mr. Wert . " Rony came forward one toro step . The girl between him and Fernando nickered in Spanish , spit fleckingfrom her . " Yeah , we know  --  " a young voice said , in sandy American . " You 'll convey it to the proper authorities . And we 're not that . " The voice detached itself to one side ; it came from a slim-headed American girl with one of those cowlick haircuts . Pretty enough . The collegiate ethic she took to be international shone from her . All the way from home . " Are we , Mr. William Wert . " She raised an arm , and made an impish salute . With a hand , foolish girl , which held a roundish object negligently . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear that she could n't quite pronounce her r 's . Then the Embassy 's armed soldier wilting at the doorway shouted , " She 's got a grenade ! "  --  raised his rifle and all but fired it . Maybe the heat made the recruit slow . Certainly he was a green one . Wert knocked the gun up in time . Perhaps her saying William had helped . He went down the steps to her . Shaken , she turned up her palm to him . " It 's only an atis , " she said in her stubbly home-burr , " that 's all it was , " and covered her mouth as if she saw the state of the world for the first time . " I know , " Wert had said tenderly . Raising his head , he saw that the picket line was taking this as personally as he was . Grinning , blushing even , they were already making the proper poems . Taking the roundish object from the girl , he went back up the steps to the soldier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But slowly . Like you 're going to lunch . Get your ass out of here ; I do n't care what your duty-hours are . " He turned the atis in his hand . " You trigger-happy fool , this is ap261custard-apple . " The guard went off whining how was he to know  --  ? The stuff these spicks ate , he 'd said . True , the thing did look exactly like a grenade . If the shot had been fired , would Wert have had to blame this damned country ? It was their fruit . But when he took a good look at her , he began to shake , and his eyes cleared . That night , after pancakes and tea , a walk clear across town , a jitney ride to the Chinese section and a dinner there , he took her to the cathedral . In its depths the squatters were already bedded down . A tiny radio squealed red-eyed . A priest came forward out of the shadows . " They spray for lice , " Wert whispered to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past Wert and the girl with quiet , tranced eyes , he went to the squatters ' corner , made the sign of the cross over them and himself and hung a lamp for them . " How there are friends  --  " Jenny whispered , " everywhere . " When she thanked Wert for saving her life he let her know how she 'd saved his . So that he could still go on with his job in some dignity  --  a trigger-happy fool stopped short of the shameful , just in time . He raised his head at that . The echoes in flats like these were thin but still serviceable . The story he 'd elected to tell himself was a true love story . The lovers had saved each other in the end . She  --  to be spared for Venice . He  --  to be spared for this . Balooch . Ba-a-looch . He was being brought nearer and nearer his wife by those two Iranians , but why ? Were they repeating to him , as if there was some vampire-chanceof resurrecting Jenny even yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or reminding him  --  Buried , maybe only in quicksand . But long ago . He got up and put his arms around the tree that had been planted in his house . Holding its blossom-scent and prickle , cradling deep in boughy arms that bent for him , was like holding a woman whose name he did n't yet know . But there was no use turning out the lights.  |p262ON  A FREEZING SUNDAY in New York some weeks later , he left the hotel in the East Thirties which for years had maintained an abiding home for him in the form of a hamper of two suits of different weights , two pairs of shoes , a raincoat , a dinner jacket and a small monthly storage bill inscribed , " Your pied-a-terre in New York "  --  and set out for Queens in his rented car . The car had the heady vinyl smell which nowadays came with so much that was brand-new ; its seat belt yawped at him like a jailor until he locked himself in . He was home . On the seat beside him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent biscuitsunbroken round the world , was an unwieldy package containing an assortment of their finest , centered around one modest gift to be made at the true and highest Meshed level of eternal friendship  --  his own great-grand-uncle the brigadier general 's silver collapsible travelingcup . All of this packed together in one very large pot of interesting design . " Ca n't afford to insure that , I 'm afraid , sir , " the tail-coated clerk said , admiring it . " That 's all right , " Wert said . " Neither can I. " He 'd ended up buying a seat for the package in the plane to Washington , where it rode belted in like a passenger and spoken to coyly by the stewardess , after she 'd finally agreed to allow it there . " Your wife 's not on the plane , sir ? " He 'd shaken his head , staring moodily at his package . " For the wedding of our very best friend . Friends . " He patted it . " Sorry your wife 's ill , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airlines were permitting that . " The baby , " Wert said . When she passed by again , she reached down and straightened his companion 's seat belt . " Austrian wine cooler , " he said . " Break like crazy . Ca n't think why they wanted it ; they 've been living together for years . "  |p263Though  he 'd never had need of the fantasy life , he 'd rather enjoyed being cast into the expected social frame . He had a lot of random experience and information going to waste . No trouble for instance , to find a home for that plant ; he 'd taken it at once to a dead colleague 's widowed mother , who still lived near Blenheim Park , in the glassroofedatrium her husband had built for them out of complete disregard for the climate and an equal regard for an ancestor who had been the King 's astronomer . She had converted the house to a conservatory , planted its ground to tree nurseries and now lived in a hut at the bottom of her topiary garden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  inthe midst of a grass-and-pebble chessboard on which the thirty-two tree-chessmen whose queen skirts and turreted hats she herself had clipped loomed like adversaries about to move  --  she 'd sighed , " To think that I once collected Belleek ! " From her dead son , who 'd sighed over that , too , Wert knew what that was . What did most people do with the odd knowledge and peculiar people they collected throughout life ? They passed these on to their children , who often could n't care less but in time could n't help being immersed in the fabric , too . " What 's Belleek ? " one said importantly to one 's girls  --  " Why , according to an old friend , it 's an Irish china of creamy texture but nasty puffy shape  --  exactly like the Irish temperament . " Or to the boys on occasion , slowly and mysteriously , " Why that 's a job for the King 's astronomer . " For of course one gave them one 's fantasy , as well . He could recall his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those days the whites more often relegated this duty to the blacks . Until Wert was ten , the cooks and gardeners of the town , the servants and the service people , had been his juvenile literature , a communal resource shared by all white children of his rank . And the blacks of those days , with more held-in fantasies than even their own children could support , had been glad of the chance . So if now in his middle age he began to feel like some weighed-down collector whose bric-a-brac was turning to junk  --  was it only middle age ? Or a profession where he remained a cultural tailor who never sent in the Sunday suit , a diplomate of the world 's health , who must never prescribe ? Not to reach even the brightest conclusion  --  that was his job . But privately , he had accumulated some . Would he and Jenny have had children after all ? Did he want them now ? Other people 's children were like other people 's art to him ; he had never wanted to possess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men never wanted children , and women rarely . When convention didn'tp264force it , a dissolution of other needs or a generalized yearning did , or that great progenitor , accident  --  until they saw the child . Then of course , they wanted to do it again , for the drama it added to the most meager lives . Viewed even dispassionately , to put into the world somethingabsolutely new , yet dragging in its train all the old mysteries , was a marvelous act . He could only hope he was n't going to do something silly with women , or even with boys , though he had no taste for them . Doing either because of his sudden rosy passion  --  to transmit . " Is it a rose ? " he 'd said to the widow , after she and a helper had lifted its clay pot out of the larger one , so that she could see its drainage  --  which had been as should be . The lorry he 'd borrowed from the Hartsdalepub had a brewer 's name on it . Wert wore a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oxfordshire tanning his cheeks . " You look lively , " she commented . " No . Not a rose or a daisy either , you clot . Nearer some form of mountain laurel , I fancy . I shall have to look in the book . If it 's there . " It was n't . " Ca n't be a rose , " he said , coloring , remembering his grasp of it . " No thorns . " Well , perhaps after all some hybrid ; was his friend a grower ? " Used to be one , " Wert said , digging in a toe . " Once owned some of the largest opium fields in Iran . Made his millions from them . But at eighty he got rid of them . And has given a great deal of money for a hospital . " " Ah so , " she said without a blink . " Well , it 's not a poppy . By the way , the hut wo n't take that other pot . The fancy one . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She stopped to detach the withered wreath which still clung to the plant 's trunk . " Why , these were tree-orchids  --  how prettily they 've dried ! I shall save them for my granddaughter , who 's thirteen . At that age they press them , you know . Only us old parties dig . " She got up heavily , dangling the circlet from a wrist whose withered state it matched . " These came with ? How extraordinary . So an old party sent you all this , eh ? Pity . " She gazed up at him with the sibyl bluntness of all good gardeners . " Well , I 'll board your plant treasure for you . " " No , it 's yours . " She gave that English snuffle-click old Bakhtiary must have heard in the Cotswolds eighty years ago , and bent over the plant again . " Ah , you Arab beauty , I 'll take you in . " She fondled the thick stem . " Our village inn wo n't , you know . Take in Arabs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do crowd one you know , abominably . " She crooned over the plant , greedily . " But I 'll take you . Ilowever did you get here ? "  | " I imagine she came by hand , " Wert said  --  and drove the whole way back to London in astonishment . Uneasily , he rang Cicely , the barrister . They had a fine evening  --  though not on the rug . In Washington two days later , he was having lunch at the Monocle with Nosworthy , in town on the same business  --  a departmental conferenceon the serious drop in quality of the new recruits . " We 're getting only the squares , " Nosy said . " White or black . Oh , the ones with good accents and maybe a little money behind them  --  we always got some . And the smart-aleck ones who want to be gentlemen . That 's all right in a foreign-service . As long as there 's also a steady enough stream of men at the top with  --  not only brains , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure , " Wert said . " Could you possibly mean  --  men like us ? " " Ah , come on . " Nosy glanced from one tight little table to another . The place was a congressional haunt rather than one of theirs , which was why Wert had chosen it . " It 's not the Viet war that pisses off the young anymore , by the way . That generation 's gone . " " Where ? " Wert said . " Come on . Into the nation , that 's where . And doing very well . . . . I went up to Harvard the other day . Two staff men we 'd very much like to have . Collaborated on a position paper for us once . Smart as hell , one of them . The other not bad . Not your academic jerks , either . Smooth . Know what that smart-ass had the nerve to say to me ? Mister , when I want to have a hand in my country 's diplomacy , I 'll join a multinationalcorporation  --  where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And his sidekick agreed with him . " " Nosy  --  " Wert said , " you and Gail having more trouble in Ja-maica ? " The answer was yes . They would n't be able to hold onto the house they 'd put all their hearts into , unless they wanted to retire to a state of siege , political and vandal . His wife was desperate . " She says she 's too old to rethink the world . " " But that 's what old age is , is n't it ? When you ca n't ? " Nosy was holding a cigar to his ear , rolling it between thumb and forefinger to hear any stale crackle . He still got them from Cuba . " You thinking much , these days ? " Wert took the offered cigar and lit it . " Multinationals ? Bigger deeds , bigger words . When you and I came in , corruption used to be quainter though . More personal . " " Gim me back that cigar . "  |p266Wert  was touched by the American shyness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke . " It appears I 'm about to be tempted , Uncle . Not sure with what . Want to bet on it ? " As he told his story , beginning with the Garrick and including a good part of that evening 's reflections  --  leaving out only the tree 's effect on him , and maybe not quite  --  a pale , incredulous smile grew on Nosy 's face , but he would say nothing , only shaking his head until Wert had finished . " I 'm fascinated with Manoucher , " he said then . He made Wert repeatall the young man 's utterances he could remember . " I might turn up in Iran ; you never know . " As to Manoucher 's inviting the Garrick 's manageress to the Dorchester , he 'd guessed it almost before Wert said , " It 's even possible he asked her there only for the company . They like female company , you know . Men of the harem nations . For itself . " Nosworthy had once been in Turkey for a long while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They like to be centered in it , that is ; they 're not like us . We get a mortal lot of it  --  but that 's different . " All Nosworthy 's conversational reactions were governed by what he could or could n't tell either his wife or the nation  --  which by now might be identical . Though he was very good about the old man , very polite about the wedding . " They 're not satyriasts ; never think that . The dynastsmean so much to them . " At times he could be a very smart man . " So you 're going to Queens the very day of the wedding ; who suggested that ? " " The Bakhtiary women invited me for it . The wives . " When he 'd called Manoucher 's home , three women had answered , apparently on three different extensions . A fourth phone , over which he 'd heard younger giggles , was picked up afterward . " They 're going to hold a celebration throughout the day  --  I 'm asked to early lunch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by hookup , they hope to talk to Iran . " Hesitated . " To the son I expect , Manoucher . And the  --  family . And maybe the girl . " He did n't know the protocol . Or if there was one . Or whether they still honored it . " It 's all been arranged . " " They must have rented satellite time . " Even Nosy was awed . Wert 's conversation with the three women had been a kind of chorale , with each voice first identifying herself . " This is Soraya . " The young daughter-in-law , it must have been  --  Manoucher 's wife . " This is Fateh . " The old man 's second wife . And " This is Madame . " Meaning clearly the wife . " Only Fateh spoke in Farsi as well as English . Giggling all the way . She sounds a silly type . " The fourth extension 's giggles ,  |p267Fateh  's young daughters , had quickly stopped . On command of Madame . " What does Madame speak ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of times in English , though . " Stiltedly , but it might be only manner . Even the instrument , which vibrated when she spoke , seemed to know this was Madame . " And the daughter-in-law ? Manoucher 's new wife ? " " English , good as you or me . " In a dovelike , scarcely accented voice which Wert , brooding on its tone , could still hear . Resolute . Or some other old-fashioned word , or biblical one . Nosy was , delighted with Wert 's plans for the pot . But when Wert pressed him for an opinion on what the Bakhtiarys might be up to , he would give none . " Well , you 'll find out in a year , wo n't you ? Their plans for you , I mean . I agree they have some . As for why Manoucher 's in exile  --  " Nosy shrugged . " Maybe he 'll tell you that then , too . Maybe it 's even  --  something we ought to keep our eye on . " He rubbed his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mind having that young man in the Department . " On the nature of what gift might be in store for Wert , Nosy refused to speculate , only shaking his head and saying , " I doubt if you 'll have to retire "  --  still with that faint smile . Insisting on paying the check , though , as if  --  Wert himself said  --  it was some kind of anniversary . Usuallythey each paid their own deductibles . " It is an anniversary , " his friend said . Outside the Monocle , they 'd gazed at the wide expanse between it and the building beyond , and the rising breastworks of the rest of Washington . " Since Manila , " Nosy said . Turning , he clapped Wert on the shoulder affectionately . Wert did ti e same , though he was usually undemonstrative with his own kind . Funny , when the European double kiss or male hug of warmer countriesgave him no trouble , abroad . " Well , let me know , " Nosworthy said , when the departmental car drew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenterhooks . " Wert would n't see them for a year ; they were going to Sri Lanka . Wert 's hand was shaken hard in parting , and his face was stared into , keenly . " I always loved Jenny , " Nosy said . On the shuttle back to New York , Wert puzzled over that . Nosy had written him from Manila at Jenny 's death . By the time they met again , three years had gone by , leaving Jenny both too near and too far to be easily spoken of , even if Wert 's new arrangements  --  a woman here , a Woman there  --  had n't been plain . Now , after all this time , there was something ... valedictory in what Nosy had said , yet he 'd done it almostp268gaily . When did people say a thing like that to you ? There was a tone in it which Wert recognized but could n't seize . In New York , the hotel manager welcomed him sadly . A new managementand a renovation was in the works ; after this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In exchange , Wert would have televisionin the room when he stayed there , instead of in the clubby old lounge to which the hotel , quiet as a library upstairs , had always relegatedit , and though his new room would be half the size of this one , he would have a modern closet with sliding doors , instead of that clumsy old armoire . " Gentlemen are going out , " Mr. Wemyss said . At eighty , and with a matching wife who still regretted their death notices could n't be in the defunct Herald Tribune  --  " the Times is simply not the same ! "  --  he was certainly one of them . " Gentlemen are always on the way out , " Wert said irritably . One felt the world was going to rack and ruin when one was of an age to feel it , irrespective of whether or not it was true . But he 'd never before been classed as on that side of time 's colonnades . Luckily , the woman whom he always called first when here still lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted her , along with her three grown daughters . During a round of plays and dinners , Wert made her talk of her girls ; he was n't sure why . She was delighted to . Always tactful with his bachelor lack of interest , she never had . The three were all willful and all pretty . " Like me , once . " Little by little her anecdotes slipped farther out , across table and into their bed . " Oh , with kids , either you eat them alive or are eaten , " she 'd say , staring at her napoleon as if it was a small coffin . Each night now , after love , she resumed her histoire . She was a dear , kind woman ; her house offered comfort artistically disciplined , and in sex her backbone arched with joyful intensity anywayhe asked it to , her breasts pillowing him afterward . He tried to think of her , heroic among her warped nymphs , as all the lovelier for her distress . Blond hair streaming on her satin sheets , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can talk to you about it , with most men you have to walk such a chalk line . " Though the girls were all away on a school trip , the three now advanced on him , steady on over their aches and abortions . He 'd intended to ask their mother to stow his hamper in one of her many opulent closets , but after that night decided not to . Inside him , the vote had gone against her . It was n't in this way he wanted to become part of the dynasts . Besides , on these cold nights which were rocketing up the new year ,  |p269all  New York was a blue mosque . For sure , one would never meet a mullah there . The winds honking him across plazas had no underside from Russia ; at their center he would never hear , like a tuning fork , the desert 's stealth . But down on the Lower East Side , where he went alone one night to the theater , a vendor roasted something on a cart from which came that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with charcoal -- here sweet potatoes , a good try , but not the great hairy beets smoking red and orange , under an Elburz sunset which had hung in the west like a fine rug . In Tabriz , the men shu ing along under that burnished light in baggy pants , suit jackets and bent fedoras had looked to him like tailors from this neighborhood . Before him in a bakery window , soft powdered cakes oozed the same poisonous yellow in front of which he used to see the Tabrizi schoolboys hungering in pairs , their fifth fingers linked . He would never bump into a donkey here if he hunkered till doomsday at the crossroads of memory . But in a dairy restaurant he sat for an hour watching a couple of old men with a week 's growth of beard , as they drank tea from a glass and played a game with counters , while their feet worked happily in and out of shoes worn down at the back . Borrowing the waiter 's pad and pencil stub , he wrote the note he owed Bakhtiary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congratulating him on marriage , and wishing him well . Outside again , he dropped into a stationery store to buy an envelope and stamp . The stage-blue had intensified . The upper bodies of people walking were circled in auras fumed with their breaths . Across the street a gutted building reared , each floor of the facade more open . At its top the stone frame pointed toward him its triangular pulpit  --  but it was n't a mosque . A letter box stood below . This city was its own city now , and the ruins were different . Staring up , he mailed the letter , to which he 'd added a post-script . " Dear friend  --  do n't send me too much . " That note must by now have reached Iran . To lie unnoticed maybe for weeks among the congratulations which in spite of all would be coming to Bakhtiary  --  and to the girl from Ardebil . Strange to think of today as her wedding day also . Would Bakhtiary be sitting apart , on his side of the house , complying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her sake little enough could be done ? While in another part , intoned over by female relatives who saw all their history in her , she sat in separate ceremony , in all her lacy , provincial pomp ? The only wedding Wert had ever seen there had been a peasant affair not far from that girl 's city , near the Caspian . Pious as the girl 's promisesp270might be , it was more likely she was some wealthy man 's daughter , of the sort he 'd glimpsed at their Embassy receptions in Paris  --  a rich Iranian milkmaid , modernized to the septum of her nose . In which case the male guests would be wearing cutaways , the youngest of the emancipatedwomen might be bared and frizzled in the style the Departmentwives termed " Call me Babe , " and after the ceremony , couples would jounce up and down together in their peculiar fox-trots , which seemed to be not so much revived from the nineteen-twenties , as saved ever since . Yet none of this meant that the girl 's promises would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of New York . The ceremony was to be at nine-thirty in the evening . So here he was , driving off to Queens for a one o'clock lunch  --  and already chilly and touchy , after early breakfast at the United Nations with a member of the Americandelegation , unknown to Wert , who 'd rung him up late and hecticallythe night before . " Woodrow Smiley-Brown  --  " this tall , bleached man said when they met , " and yes , I was christened for the late , very late President , father 's friend . As father told me daily , They 'll have to know their history , boy , to place you . ' ... " This over , he appeared less exhausted , keenly examiningeveryone who passed , and oddly excited by the UN restaurant  --  if one considered that he must see it every day of the week . Pumping Wert , he was annoyed at him for knowing only as much as the next man on " the British temp-er-a-ment . " He was one of those who visualized all national temperament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was offering him smoked salmon  --  as a thin slab of some indigenous substance on which a nation 's doings were daily deposited . But the term was useful ; when it came up you knew either that the conversation would get nowhere , or that all human talk was in vain . " No , I wo n't have more salmon , thanks , " Wert said , " I 'm going to a wedding in Teheran at one o'clock . " The roan was duly startled ; Wert had meant him to be . Over here he made use of the most shamefully childish tactics , probably because he no longer felt sure of what men were like here , or women either . In his travel-twisted way , he knew too much . He 'd grown away from those home standards which , if kept rigidly , whatever they were , made a person certain of himself for life . " Your companion going with you ? " Wert 's package , brought up from the parking lot , sat on a chair at the table 's third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be late . "  |p271Smiley  had been brought up to a certain coyness , Wert decided . As the father had . He explained , lightly sketching Bakhtiary and his entourage . " Thought they 'd discouraged multiple wives . That they do n't do that anymore . " " They do and they do n't . " He was n't going to explain Bakhtiary to this man . " Never multiple , though . Islam allows four , I believe . " " So you 're going to lunch with three old ladies , to listen to their husband , the old guy  --  get married again . By international hookup . " " Two wives . Third one 's the young daughter-in-law . And neither wife 's really old . Let 's see  --  " He 'd been intending to do this arithmetic , out of a sense that there were already mysteries enough  --  and that he ought to prepare . " Madame the first wife was married when she was sixteen and he sixtyish ; which would make her now about forty-six . " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling dowager . " " So was the second wife , Fateh . When he was about seventy-two . Eighteenyears ago ; that would make her  --  my word . Only thirty-four . The new bride 's the same age they were . " " Got a daughter at Brearley who 's sixteen , " Smiley said gloomily . " You ever feel that these older countries have the right attitude toward  --  got any daughters , Wert ? " " No . Though I have friends who do . " " Umph ... This daughter-in-law  --  what age is she ? " " In a way , she 's the oldest . She 's already twenty-four . Of course , she went to the University of Teheran . But only just married  --  that 's still very late  --  for their girls . Or used to be . " " It 's us , " Smiley said , still gloomy . " You may depend upon it ; it 's us . " " You know Iran ? " " No , I was a social scientist . Specializing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field . Or a big empty one . Southern Ghana  --  four years there . Then northern Nigeria , two more . Village structure  --  I wrote a book on it . " He leaned forward . " What 's your ambition , Bill ? " Wert had n't been asked that question so bluntly since high school . In reality it was always being asked . In America , unless you had an ambitionthat showed , people did n't know how to ticket you . Even naked ambition , properly bared , made them feel safer . You might even go farther because of it . " On my college placement bureau 's form , I put  --  ' to see the world . ' " I'hey switched it . To ' Foreign Service . ' " " Ileh . " Chin on his big folded hands , Smiley was still swinging his glance keenly left-right.  | " Later , for the Foreign Service application , I switched it , To see the changing of nations , ' I put  --  I was twenty-three . They thought it quite elegant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Best little statement of the departmental cop-out we ever saw , " Nosy had said . " Got you to Manila the moment we saw your resume . We can use a young officer with your kind of talent for talk-talk . " Leaving the young Wert with the first of the romantic sorenesses which were to replace each yesterday 's heart . " Well , you 're seeing it . " Smiley swept out a hand . " Mmmm . " Even at breakfast the UN smelled of polyglot sweets and sours , ethnic stipulations and aversions . The smell of any of those tradingplaces where the map changes ran off the tables like water and populations blew before the wind  --  how this excited him even yet ! " They thought I meant  --  changeover , " Wert said . " Are n't you going to ask me ? " " You ? ... Oh yes . What 's your ambition  --  Woodrow ? " " To have a village . An African village . Named after me . " Smiley screwed up his eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said a series of African syllables , grinning . " That 's me . I could still do it . Even these days . If I went back . " " Ca n't you ? " " I 'm trying . That 's why I 'm here . " " Why 'd you leave Africa in the first place ? " " Came back home to marry the girl I left behind me . Biggest weddingthere since old Woodrow himself . She was the daughter of a dean . " Two women from Sierra Leone passed by in their richly striped and segmented dress . Woodrow stared after them morosely . " Got hooked to stay on , at the college . And never got back to my village . Or had one named for me here . " He grinned again . " The college already being named . " " Say "  --  Wert smiled at himself  --  already so American again . " Say , your father was n't by chance the Brown . The anthro man . My best friend from home studied with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Smiley 's nod plainly had been nodded many times before . " Changed my name . Added on my mother 's . Because of the overtones . " Overtones indeed . " I even saw him once . " The old professor , pointed out to Wert by his worshipful friend had had that worldwide look to him even when shuffling unkempt down a university corridor , through colleaguestweeded up and suburbanized . They had n't been able to do that either to his looks or to his tongue , which now and then made thep273papers with near-indecent pronouncements on American life . As a father , the old anthropologist might well have been one of those who should have had only daughters  --  at least in America . " So when the bid came for here , I took it , " Smiley-Brown said . " Got divorced over it . She said if I ever got back to Africa , I 'd want to stay , and keep her and the kids with me , even marry them to blacks . " He snorted toughly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah . " Smiley-Brown gazed past him and out the window . " Sunday . Know why I like to come here on Sundays ? Because here there are n't any . They 've buried them , under their own Fridays  --  that 's the Muslim one , is n't it ?  --  and Sabbaths , and general hut ceremonies . The way they 're going to bury us . Can you imagine any of our women here ? In their church hats ? " " My wife never wore a hat . " " Ah . Both my wife and my mother did . " Woodrow drummed his fist on the table . " My  --  stepmother does , too . " He shuddered , opening his mouth wide . " Ah , " Wert said . " My father remarried , you see , quite recently . So did my wife . " " Oh ? " The traumas of the recently divorced or divorcing were always so stale and unvirginal . Must be why bachelors listened to a lot ofthem . " What sort d' ya think those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m . " The old guy , Smiley 's father ? Probably , by now  --  some woman who would clean him up . And Smiley 's wife , breathing all this propaganda under that hat ? Very possibly  --  a black . Smiley-Brown was staring through him , and out the other side . " They married each other . " " Eee , " Wert said . " Our daughters are with them . They 've bought a brownstone here , and are sending the girls to Brearley . After all his talk . " " And your sons ? " " Have n't any . " " Hah . " Having exhausted his monosyllables , Wert looked at his watch . Woodrow placed a hand across it . " Scads of time , really . Your boulevard'sjust down the road . . . . So you see what I mean , do n't you ? About the older countries . " Wert stood up . " Sorry . No , I do n't see . " What I see is the frighteningly personal drift of all Men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Manila , who had n't believed in talk-talk , but not from international conclusions  --  only because the sexual tremors which engagedhim from wrist to liver to brain were n't up to it anymore . Or that gambling French cultural attache to whom all culture was a coin , includinghis own . Or even my own British opposite in London , who does act more impersonally than any of us , not as he thinks because his passion-for-no passion is so well ingrained  --  but because the passions of the belly , when sated five times a day , are more ignorable than the rest . Three Senegalese Moslems passed in a waft of white . Wert sat down again . " It 's true , they more often travel together . Arabs . But that 's all I 'll vouch for . " " They 're calling themselves the new nations , now . " Brown screwed his eyes to slits . " And why not  --  they 've got real life behind their backs , re-al struc-tured life . . . while we-uns . . . Arrh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there . " One brilliant group after another , leopard-sashedor pinwheel-haired or in Arab white , went under his pointingthumb . Europeans and others from the West , or dressed like the West , also thronged the hall , but Smiley-Brown was n't seeing them . Harder to , of course , but whether this was because they were more faded in color or more complex in spirit , only time could say . Certainly another quasi-European Westerner could n't . The room was full of people tangentially closer to Wert and each other than most , each conscious that this ribbon of humanity they were in was an era . The scene had that tremendous , noisy vigor which the centrally busy passing scene always did . He 'd never met such publicly displayed human surety as was flaunted here  --  in a hall no longer in its heart devoted to the curatorship of the living world but crowding in for the ceremonious process of its dying . For the coming pyrotechnical death-talk , each country wanted the best seats in the house . There were no shy people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed their table again , ripely as chords in music . Behind them , traipsing on and off one game leg , went an old Hollander , Wetter Maim Schroon-Malmsey , whose names had eighty years ago been amassed to hide the Javanese grandmother he was now forever mentioning . On the committees which dealt with those political prisoners whose betterment had been his lifework , he had the most pacific of tongues , careful never to speak aloud the controversial word " freedom . " While he talked , one could see again the stolid Dutch galleons which had steadily plied history while others fought . When worsted in an argument , he dipped his old bones and blanched-vegetable face like a third-rate actor , one hand on hisp275heart , the other flung high in minuet . He believed in his own cause , yet like most here his very strengths came from a cynical flow exactly opposite . The most enduring international politicians had the same temperament as women of fashion ; they were not profound thinkers but experts at seizing the infallible costumes of the moment , blithely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their closets . Sincerity was not involved . Or the earthly paradise either  --  unless it happened to be a la mode . " I rather wish I could be like the people here , " Wert said . " They know for sure the passing scene is just that . " " Ah , man  --  you want a village . " " Balls . " Both their ambitions , so picayune . " But if I come across a tribe , a noble savage tribe where it 's in the structure for the fathers to marry the sons ' wives  --  I 'm sure there must be one  --  I ' 1l let you know . " " Thanks , there 's a kind bastard . " Smiley was bright red . " But now that you 're offering  --  take me along with you , this afternoon . " Wert recoiled . " Why ? " " Maybe because I know the way . Queens Boulevard may be near , but it 's not easy . " " I 'll find it . " " Maybe because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Western Electric International . " " Sorry . " " Maybe because I 'd like to meet those three ladies . " With each try , Smiley-Brown leaned farther across the table , almost kneeling on his chair . " It 's a Moslem household . Ca n't take a man they do n't know . " " You have n't met them . " Wert threw up his hands . Smiley-Brown sat back with the calm which came from being beyond embarrassment . " Maybe because I want to hear that old guy give the responses , then . " Wert swallowed ; red crept up him also . Anybody who bothered to look could see the two of them for what they were , two angry dogs from the West . " He wo n't be giving them . " A wave swept over him . Two homesick dogs from the West . He could almost see Bakhtiary standing at his elbow in the stage fog which traditionally surrounded such visitantswhen they came to warn  --  or to give advice . " Do n't the men speak at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw , bride and groom had separate rituals . But for all I know , this one could be taking place at the Teheran Hilton . Withp276our ambassador acting as best man . " He looked over his shoulder . " No , I do n't really believe that . . . How would they do it in your village ? " " They  --  " Smiley-Brown shrugged emptily at his own fingers , elbows on the table among the dishes . " Nemmind . " Chin in hand , his look swept round again . " Suppose you think I 'm a monomaniac , " he said hopefully . " No . " I think you 're a fairly normal man , of the sort often born to excessive fathers . " What , then ? " " I think  --  maybe you had to persuade yourself  --  that you were one . Or were persuaded . " By the daughter of a dean . " And now it 's gone . Your village is . " Others having taken advantage of it . Smiley-Brown had his head between his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had left , perhaps thinking bitterly that people who could afford to conduct all their emotions in restaurants , did so at his expense . Or else that all the emotions of such people were table-size . Wert laid down a large tip . Smiley-Brown sat up at once . " Sorry . I only see the kids every other weekend . This is the other week . They always ask me about the village . And never listen to the answer . If it has gone kaput for me , you 're the only one noticed it . " He laid a tip beside Wert 's , patting the package which sat between them . " Help you out to the car with that thing ? No ? Do n't blame you . I might jump in .... Well . Think I 'll take this desperate character to a movie . " " Wait . " Hoisting the package , Wert put it down again , back into the social framework where so much he had accumulated was going to waste . " Your girl goes to Brearley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had n't quite said . " See you know the lingo . Do n't tell me you do have  --  " " No . " " Did n't think . " Wert picked up a napkin and brushed at a spot on the package . " Why not ? " " Something two-dimensional about men your age who do n't have offspring  --  troubled or not . Had n't you noticed ? " Smiley-Brown , having broken down in front of him was getting back at him for it . Whereas in Meshed , or Tabriz , they 'd have linked pinkies over his outburst , and wept mutually . " Hmmm . " Wert looked down at himself . " Well , I 've still got a vest . " He pulled a pen from it . " Listen . Do me a favor . Call up a friend of mine whose girls go there , too . Spend the afternoon . " Was this dirty of him ,  |p277or  samaritan ? Dirty at first , but then the other . " You wo n't be sorry . Warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say I sent you , mind . At least not at first . Today you 're just a wounded parent wanting to talk to another one . " Over here his suits never had any accumulation of paper . He tore off a flap from the package , wrote a name , number and address on the reverse side , and handed it over . " Her troubled daughter 's name is Nancy , same as hers . " Smiley took the paper and read . Half smiling , he tapped his teeth with it . " Do n't get the lady wrong . She 's a friend . " " But I 'm not supposed to mention it , hah ? " " Not right away . " " Not until your own afternoon errands are complete , eh . I see . " " No you do n't . Never mind . If you do choose to go , you 'll find it  --  " How could he say it ? It 's where the two of you can weep mutually . " You wo n't have to  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help him to the car after all . " Oh I 'll go , " Smiley said , lingering at the car door , tensing his long unmu Y ered neck in the raw air . The sky had a leaden secrecy ; it was about to snow . He shivered like a bird . " I 'm curious . " No , you are desperate , Wert said to himself , stowing the package in the passenger 's seat . Arms still around it , he stopped short . But how do I know ? Smiley was studying the reverse side of the paper with the telephone number on it . " Fortnum 's . That the place where the grocery clerksclarks  --  dresslike  --  deputy ambassadors ? " He let his eyes flick over Wert 's second suit , the ten-year-old one , which he was wearing in deference to the coming afternoon , and back to the piece of brown paper the wind was fluttering . " Biscuits , it says here . That great heavy thing holds biscuits ? Poe- Soraya . And what was it  --  Fatima @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " They sent me a pot from Iran that 's damn near a national treasure , " Wert said sharply . " The old man did . I 'm returning it . " " Did he now . Whatever for ? " " Wish I knew . And he 'll only send me something else . For better or worse . As a valedictory bequest . I wish I knew what . " Wert 's neck felt cold ; the dress muffler he wore was too thin . " The ladies know , I fancy . Over there , they usually know everything . " " And never say a word ? " Smiley s ' ; hed . " Never used to . " Wert paused , hand on the car door . " Funny . I can - almost feel  --  what it 's going to be . But not quite . Some bloody complica/tion I 'd be very wise to  --  forestall . It 's on the tip of my tongue , but I ca n't name it . It 's even in my own day-to-day actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even be able to see . " He thought of Nosy . " Are able . Knowing me . " " Ma-an . Maybe you better go to a movie . " They shook hands lengthily , grinning at each other . " Maybe your Nancy and I 'll talk you over , " Smiley said . " If we see anything , let you know . " Both laughed , and kept standing there . " Going to snow , " Wert said , staring up . " Yeah . " Smiley probed the gray sky carefully . " Going to snow . " Watching him go , Wert thought he looked jauntier . Starting up the car , he slapped its dashboard as if it were the rump of a horse . Nancy would be answering the telephone within say  --  half an hour . At least he 'd done a destiny job as neatly as a machine . Going around the block to change directions , he found Smiley on the corner , just hailing a cab . The traffic light held them fast . " Have fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray and fine ; it meant business . Each car traveledthe eclipsed morning in its own shroud . In his three-sided bay window he piloted a satellite lost on Queens Boulevard , in light spectrallybroader than any in London . Through the swirl , high-rise apartmentbuildings lofted up into the mists , dull palaces all with the same portico , occasionally a delicatessen or drugstore alongside . They had no addresses out front ; they were ashamed of having only these six-digit numerals . No doorman knew the number of the adjacent hive . Only one could tell him in which direction on his side the numerals went higher ; across the avenue was an unknown continent . He had by now inquired of four , each a sorrier grenadier as one got closer , all with blank eyes and coffin-chins . Each portico gaped forward , an old alligator'supper jaw , its quartzy hide and gilt sawteeth chipped . Each man stood in the throat , the snow fogging all to an old movie frame . This was a foreigner 's bad dream of America , but a cheaper surreal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing out here ? Once , Middle-Eastern United Nations functionaries had crowded into nearby Queens before they found its Third Avenue equivalent , or the even newer galleries and black basalts of mid-Manhattan . But that would have been years ago , about the same time as when he and Iranians like these had first met . They were dragging each other back , maybe . " Afraid I 'm lost , " Wert said over the drugstore phone . " Sorry . " " Ah , of course . Where are you ? " A high male voice , squeaky , elegant . A papal nuncio , met once in that Rome hotel where all the priests went , had had a voice like that . Since those traveled in pairs , he half expected two men to enter the drugstore . Only one hatless elder came toward him , a fan of salt-and-pepperp280curls high above his head , the handsome face unknown to him , but not its nose curl , these black-silk brows , the cheeklines drawn with a stroke of the pen downward , the nostrils that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fereydoun . Cousin . Come in my car , Mr. Wert . " A 450 SL Mercedes , glowworm in the dim . He led the way , in that sloppy gait of theirs . Wert , transferring the package , could n't see the backs of his shoes . Inside the car , the snow seemed scarcely to have wetted that morning coat and striped pants . It was all coming back to Wert , the way they took the current atmosphere deeply into themselves  --  flowers , heat , oases , rain  --  but not like Westerners , into the boredom of conversation . " I was not in Venice when you were there , Mr. Wert . " He meant Wert to know he knew what had happened there . " I am with Madame . Always . " He pushed that forward , for a reason . I am not with Bakh . But the voice was what astonished . One flute-step beyond mere homosexuality , or age , where among Wert 's travels did it belong ? Bal000ch ? No , not that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions , anywhere . " But I have met your cousin . Your family house in Athens , Georgia  --  beautiful . " " You brought the ring home . My wife 's ring . " Fereydoun 's nod started the car . Yes , they were dragging Wert back . He wo n't dig in his heels , he wants to be . Already . " You 're Madame 's cousin ? " " Oh yes . But I am also Bakhtiar . " He does n't add the y or i that some do ; there are variations . It 's after all a tribe , a locale , as well as a name . And a force in their history . " But Madame was n't with you . In Georgia . " Wert 's cousin would have said . She 'd gone on for pages as it was . " No . Someone else take my place with her . " The French had a name for such flutes  --  the mirliton . The car drew up a circular driveway and under a portico . They 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She does n't travel alone . " Fereydoun turned off the ignition . He sighed . " But Bakh "  --  he paused  --  " he wanted to know what your house is like . " His mouth went roguish , as if it talked out of school . As if it often did . " That far back ? I ca n't  --  " Believe it . But he could . They got out of the car , Wert trundling the package . He 's the family equerry , I suppose , his cousin had written , iii her spritely imp-lady style.  |p281He  waddled rather , but was wonderful with the muffin stand , and compliments to suit . I should n't mind having one of him for my very own . And he knew the ring for what it was . Their grandmother 's sherry-wine ruby . She 'd been enraged at the idea of its going into a grave . Fereydoun 's gait was n't due to shoes , his sleeker than Wert 's own , which the hotel 's hamper had n't improved . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know quite why . At that moment Fereydoun turned just inside the maw of the entrance , where again a uniformed man stood in diminishing perspective  --  and made a low bow of welcome , his hips drawing him back  --  Coppelia , a sorcerer 's bow , a wheedling . Wert had seen old Prince Chumpot shu e on his knees to and from the then young king of Thailand , but that was protocol . This came from the man himself , deeper than style . Fereydoun was n't fat exactly , but pear-shaped , as the striped trousers made plain . Like that castrato tone of voice ? Among the Bagirmi , in north-central Africa , such men were said to still exist ; a retired colleague had so described their voices . Above Fereydoun 's wing collar and bow tie the neck lapped in a girdle-ofVenusfold . A chill hit Wert 's stomach . No , his cousin would n't mind . Ladies from his heath , of her era , could still strangle a chicken because it tasted better after , or shoot a stoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ Episcopal lost his voice , due to virility . Once informed of what a Fereydoun might be , she 'd never condescend to thank of it further , and continue to enjoy her muffins . Like Madame ? Because this would have been the bargain under which she could leave ? Had been allowed to leave  --  Bakh ? They were now on the twelfth floor , in front of one of a long corridor of doors . Fereydoun had rung . " I have key . But ladies want to be warned . " A laugh like a squeaked grass-blade . In the mountains of France they used onionskin for those flutes . " I 'm not dressed for a wedding . " Fereydoun sighed , tremolo . " The other side of the water  --  wo n't see . " He 's Bakh 's era , if not quite his age . A fine-grained eighty-odd. ' ' hose glandular eyelids , not born to that face ? It could have happened , within the boyhood history of those two . Their country 's history was full of sporadic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atarnea  --  and patron of Aristotle  --  was one ; they 're not always tabby cats . Nurses , the general under Justinian . Smart , and faithful beyond other  --  men.  |p282Wert  's hands were chilled . He rubbed them . Just that I 've never knowingly seen one . His own genitals felt cold . Fool  --  it was n't catching . Fereydoun was scrutinizing him , his suit . Footsteps padded to the door . " I 'm  --  a bequest , " Wert said . " Are n't I. " Fereydoun put up a plump hand . Not a hermaphrodite face , but of a special antiquity . The eyes mild with retrospect . Altered to it ? The mouth went roguish again , tittered , and bit itself . " So  --  am I. " As the door opened and was held for them by a woman in chador , Fereydoun bent and transferred the flower in his own buttonhole to Wert 's . They followed the chador , a stolid gray servant-shape , unchanged . Ahead , down one of those lemon-pale hallways which promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings provided , all floorlacquerand cream-colored slats and lozenge design , he heard a fountainof female giggling . Smoke drifted , underlined with perfume ; was there ever any smell more enticing ?  --  promising frivolity and a light session of human politics , nothing to do with government . At the head of the hall he stopped , in a waft of wheat-smell . But not wheat . " Polo ? " he whispered . Not accurate , but the way he remembered their saying it . Their long-grain rice , cooking somewhere . Fereydoun 's teeth glistened . Wert felt his own backbone melting . Oh my God , I 'm going to be happy , he thought , dismayed . From the next room he could already sense that clan energy of people to whom roses were important , but who in their time had also lopped heads , grown opium , with a girlish smile for this when challenged , and two kings back had had a ruler who munched kebab while poets were hanged  --  and whose last Shah had once publicly bowed the knee to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wert remembered the other name for a mirliton . Eunuch-flute . The serving-maid was beckoning . Amazing , how they 'd used to do this from within that garment  --  and to see it still done , here in Queens  --  with the man next to him watching . Wert was made to put his present in a small room off the hall . As he set the box down in relieved good riddance , the name for what it had represented returned to him . Pishkesh  --  theprefavor or sweetening . Or bribe . By which you are warned . Ahead , the chattering has stopped . His own Farsi 's already rushing back to him , clamoring a word for every object he sees , and all the old phrases he 'd always been glib and good at orally , able to float in thep283give-and-take from street to embassy , though nearly unable to write or transcribe . Today , why appear to know any of it ? Little advantage enough . " Alors  --  " Fereydoun says , as if from now on they must expect any language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees is Bakh . The long walls of this triple-sized room are hung with rugs : the two end walls are huge movie screens , one blank . On the other , slide-projected larger than in life , Bakh 's sitting in his garden , a girl at his side , facing the real-life family photograph below . Fifty to a hundred people must be in the room , lined up there , below the screen . Above them , Bakhtiary is in a black suit , on which Wert can sense the baking sun , a hand on each pommel of his highbackedchair . " Bakh  --  " Wert says . It 's much the same face , except for the sunglasses , which are on a table to Bakhtiary 's right . He had wanted the people here to be looking at him . They 'll be able to search his face for hours on end ; he has the advantage of being a photograph . Any secrets are jewels inside him , safe . All the girl 's jewels are on the outside  --  hung between her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare wrists and throat . She 's in Western dress , one of those wisps for summer , but grasps a shawl awkwardly round her shoulders . The small nose has the downward-curvingseptum , just right for a ring , but it too is bare . Her eyes are cast down though , on Bakh . " She is first time out of chador , " Fereydoun says , falsetto . Perhaps he ca n't whisper . " Ah . Madame . " They must have lined themselves up under the screen just before Wert entered . In the center is a long row of women of all ages , brilliantlydressed . In front of these are the children , party-dressed also . Behind the women , garbed in their black-white as if for a graduation day , as if they have n't moved since he last saw their country , stand the men . All bow formally . When Madame moves , the lines break up . In spite of the men 's Swiss watches and Italian silk suits and the women 's spicy French aura , it flashes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two young women with babies on their hips . Or that screen , high above them like a colored sail . They are immigrants . Madame comes forward , robin-breasted in her purple sweater set , on the pouty legs which for Wert link all European women from Finisterre to Leningrad , except for the Swedes . Wert knows when a hand is extendedroyally . The hand he kisses is boneless in that peculiar way . Incurved , almost vestigial , it must never have done more than fold ap284napkin or slip on a ring ; it may never have buttoned for itself or forced on a boot . Its exercise ? Perhaps holding a sheaf of playing cards . He avoids the big pearl on it as he would a royal mouth . An hour later , still seated at Madame 's side , after as many innuendos as there are nuts in the dishes scattered everywhere , he 's exhausted but has learned a good deal , though not yet what 's in store for him . All this is surely intended . At first he 'd wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , but has been persuaded , though by swift gesture only , that they may not be as they were  --  so is now drinking scotch . Some of them may be . Wherever possible they convict themselvesof nothing . Does the jube , the water ditch , still run through Teheran , even on the main drag , Pahlevi ? He has n't been able to get anyone to say . Perhaps they no longer want to say the former Shah 's name . Madame , as he was surely told long ago , is family-connected . Or perhaps because they have moved on . He knows now why they 're in Queens . The place belongs ostensibly to Fereydoun , who was once years ago at the UN . Each time apartments adjacent or on floors above or below have been vacated , he 's acquired them ; he now has two floors , and after brief difficulty with the fire laws  --  a sweep of Madame 's pearled hand  --  has built a staircase to suit . Though he is single  --  had her eyelids leveled for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palace , used to space . He 's of an in-between generation ; though younger than Bakh , his father was a general with Reza Shah . The former Shah 's father can be mentioned by name ; he is history . Fereydoun is her cousin , all here being at the very least cousins , of near or far degree . He 's actually the son of her mother 's oldest half-brother , and as a young man wheeled Madame in her carriage . " Because of our mothers being so young , much is different with us , " she says , again with a leveling . Wert ca n't detect whether or not she ever looks up at the screen ; he 's still waiting for her to mention Bakh . But a queen bee , if ever he 's seen one . What 's exhausting him is his effort to see these people more than visually . Some diplomats never get past seeing foreigners as scenery ; it 's a hazard of the trade . He 's never had that trouble , even with the Japanese , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh he knows the odds of all of it , the self-delusionary traps . Yet these people keep peacocking themselves in his mind , as if it 's in their very character . They have shallownesses he ca n't plumb . Madame , fat as predicted but solidly so , as if every ounce counts for something , is hugely perfumed with a velvety scent meant perhaps to hide her competence . She 's one of those short women whose groomingsp285take their attraction from the concentrated area over which these must be displayed . The face is small-nosed but powerful ; the thick black hair , cut and winged in points on the cheeks , has been ruddied with henna in the way of older women ; he had been given to understand that this was the matronly thing to do . Madame 's voice is ambery in French ; her English grates as if she 's swallowed a string of bronze beads ; both accentsare serenely heavy . If she squirrels meaning in her cheeks , one can always lean forward ; he recognizes the habit queens learn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't learned it from Bakh . Fateh , the second wife , hovering always near , is a thin fashion-plate , expertly auburned all over . An extremely routine sophistication , twirlingfrom rings to dark glasses , to scarves to hair , makes her look older than she must be , no doubt intended , as the mother of all those girls . The rings , seven of them , are more astounding than anyone else 's , but what 's most extraordinary about her  --  realized when she came forward to meet him , bowed with her hands clasped over her face , and greeted him in Farsi  --  was that they had already met . It ca n't be , but of course is . After Jenny 's accident . This is the same woman who , veiled like one of the Fates , had dropped her veil at Bakh 's command . " With her place showing , " she 'd said of Jenny 's fall . And now here she is , with her long silky legs showing , a little skinny and ankle-y , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's heard the chic Departmental women bill to each other like birds , beige beige beige , she looks like many women he 's seen liberated from purdah or chador or even the nun 's habit  --  absolutelycorrect at all times , for anything but home . Two of the girls she 's had from the old man are in the background , mutedly the gigglers he 'd heard over the phone , though not the Swiss school-girls he 'd expected but highly painted young dazzlers . A few of the older men remind him of those he met at the Danieli ; one or two may even be the same . Young or old , the men have lost a certain naivete ; not even the patriarchs would now expect the Departmentto compensate him for the death of one wife by supplying him another . The world has grown smaller for them , too  --  and along with their loss had itself lost something . What aggregate innocences he 's seen lost in his time  --  tribal to national , East to West , and now , ever heavier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loth not long maintain  --  his father used to say , of the blacks who went north . At closer range , the men here have n't changed in their surety  --  which comes out in dash in the younger ones , and in the elders in a mutual tribal satisfaction . Sexual authority , Bakh said once , feeds busiiiesstoo . " Our women make us all feel first-born . So a man can stay poor ,  |p286with  dignity . " The women have had to make the most changes , or the most open ones  --  and suffer the most confusion ? In the main it was the men who forced them to change . They seem to be bearing up . They speak better English than the men . If anything , they want to be Western . The men merely want the West . " You still have your house ? " Fateh giggles suddenly . For the past hour she 'd been interviewing him , extracting just where he works , where he lives and especially whether he can expect to be posted again to Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other women falsely deplore . " Fateh ! " they cluck , and smile . She remindshim of some Southern girls , half honey-giggle , half silly-sass , with an idiot gift for the socially useful impudence . But is this Fateh 's character ? Or her duty ? " House ? " He 'd already described his London one as rented only . " A  --  " Fateh turns to Madame . " A-thens ? " At first he does n't get it ; she 'd pronounced the t . Then he understandsmore than necessary . She 's asking Madame 's questions for her . She 's the second wife . " Athens , Georgia . I 'm afraid it is n't my house . " " Not ? " Fateh makes a pursy sound , chiding him . For not having it . Or not crediting him . " My cousin 's house . " " Ah  --  your cousin 's . " A quick glance at Madame and a rippling phrase . So Fateh , too , speaks French as well as she does English  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd said  --  we know about cousins . So Madame owns Fereydoun 's apartments here ? He 's not surprised . And on Bakh 's money ? A hunk of which she keeps in that pouch-bag of hers , ever-shifting on her lap ? He glances up . All this may be Bakh 's  --  and the day not ended yet . " We 're always passing off our family junk on my cousin . " He sees that they truly do n't catch this . " I mean  --  the family 's always asking her to store things . Because the house is so big . It was our great-grandfather 's house . And some of us did go to be born in it . They seem to understand this perfectly . As to a palace ? He 'll never be able to explain the difference . " The beautiful ring is your cousin 's  --  Fereydoun showed me , " Madamesays idly . Her first question . " No  --  it was my wife 's . " No one 's yet mentioned her . " My greatgrandmother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that class are now more valuable than diamonds . In Switzerland , we know stones . " She speaks to her pearl ,  |p287her  only ring , with a covert glance at Fateh 's array . " Your cousin has daughters ? " " She 's unmarried . " They cast up their eyes . " Older than you ? " " Eighty . " " Ah . A pity she 's not with you . " " She would certainly enjoy it . " " Fereydoun say  --  your cousin very angry . " Fateh rolls her eyes athim . " Because the ring  --  you want to bury it . With your wife . " When he does n't answer , Madame intervenes . " Fateh ! And why not , Fateh ? She was the first wife . " Fateh rises . If this is dismissal , she has no rancor . A sense of the harem is wafted to him . Alliances between the women , in spite of themselves . Or because . With the big-screen husband , up there like Bakh , a still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he 's heard they have their own insistences , powerful ones . " Madame . . . Manoucher 's wife , Soraya . Where is she ? " Madame gets up . Inhaling , she addresses her body to rise , a royal chore . " My son 's wife has her own apparterent . Fereydoun ! " He appears . " He will take you there . " On the way out , men waylay him , the younger deferring to the old . He 's passed from one to the other , with cigars . Some are buying buildingshere ; others already have . He hears that shipping is for the Greek magnates ; they do not poach . And thinks he hears , innuendo in Farsi , that they do n't approve of these shippers ' women . One of the younger men owns a bank . He 's learned that a relative of Wert 's is a banker in Baton Rouge . " A kissing cousin , actually . " They have the same concept , the man says . A black sheep , sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps dogs . Whippets . Races them . Wants to leave me them . I 've refused . Not my sport . And rather expensive . " They look embarrassed , as the moneyed do at the mention of penury . Perhaps they worry he 'll become a liability  --  not that they 'd ignore that . His presence here 's a guarantee of their solicitude for life  --  and of his . He sighs , answering absently from a kind of minor truth when asked what his sport is . " Horses . " He 's sometimes imagined that his pension will run to keeping a filly , on shares maybe , and boarding her out . But he sees that once again he 's reassured them . I le and Fereydoun go up a staircase , Fereydoun plodding . Madame wo n't have an elevator . Because of the " Machine " ? Soraya 's householdp288name . " You 'll see why . " They all have these nicknames , the women . Madame is Four Eyes . " What 's Fateh 's ? " " Mouth . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This place coarsens him . Well , it 's needed . " Fereydoun ... before we go in ... what about Manoucher ? " The old man stops on the stair . " He stays with Bakh . Until . " Possibly a year , the boy 'd said . But when we spoke , the regime wasstill hanging on . " Wo n't he be in danger now ? Now that  --  " Fereydoun waits . He 's good at it . " Now that  --  the Shah . " Wert wo n't go further . How do these people say it among themselves ? In time of revolution these people are the ones seldom asked . The New York papers had n't , much . A revolution belongs to the poor . The old man exhales , putting a finger across his lips  --  a signal Wert 's been flipped in hotel rooms and embassies , seldom sure whether it comes from habit or romance . A world signal : the walls have ears . " You are with your government , Mr. Wert ? Even in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But also the right answer . " Manoucher  --  was already not with the UN . " " Oh ? Since when . " " Since he marry Soraya . " " But Bakh  --  " " Made the marriage , yes . From prison . " " Bakh ? " " Not him . The girl 's grandfather was his friend . She is in prison a year . " Did  --  Manoucher know that ? Beforehand ? " " He is the son . " Fereydoun is a study , quizzical , sorrowful . " He is told . Later , he knows it for himself . Eh , eh . " " A university student , she was , he told me . " One of those . " Eh . . . But Manoucher is also the son of Madame . " Fereydoun , fisting up , pulls on imaginary reins . " All his life , the mother and the father . A power  --  what you call it ? " " Struggle . " " Five years ago Bakh wants him out of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Pahlevi . So the bargain is  --  Manoucher can go , if he goes to them , at the UN . But he must not see his father .... So Bakh still gets his son out of the country . Eh ?

" The deepest yet . Perhaps the hand helps . But as long as Manoucher stays  --  no grandson . " Will the wife go back now ? " Now that the Shah .. . " She can not . How she is  --  you will see . For other women , enough revolution if they are  --  " He lapsed into F'arsi . " Out of the chador , " Wert said , forgetting to pretend he knew none . " Eh .

Head priest . " " I never hear that rumor before . " Fereydoun squints . " But in the case of wives , yes , Hossein is very religious there . " That nervous laugh again . " So . . . now he marries again . It 's late . The fox is at the throat . But an imam will be there . For all to see . And Manoucher , five years in America , is allowed to come home . " After a minute Fereydoun says , " Mr. Wert  --  you are not laughing ? Eh no . What Bakh said is true then . " He waits until Wert straightens his face . " You are the son from the West . " Ho , now . Ho , there . I had a father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ferey 's curiously modeled face  --  is he merely an old gay ?  --  appears over his shoulder . " And still so young , so blond , so handsome , " Fereydounis cackling . " We are so surp  --  pleased . Still such a chance for happiness . " Bless them . For always saving you from themselves just in time . If you 're the son from the West , Bill Wert , then act it . " Mr.  --  " He 's never actually heard the man 's last name . Fereydoun , he sees , is n't going to supply it . " Fereydoun  --  what 's in store for me here ? " The old man grips the balustrade , very handsome in his black-andwhiteway . There 's a decoration now in his buttonhole . His tongue moves under his lower lip , exploring it . " Eh , you do n't know ? " " 1 know he must have his reasons for all this . " What I want to know is  --  how am 1 one of them ? " Reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now its one foot afterp290the other for people like us  --  and do n't look up at the third one , over your neck . " " I 'm returning the pishkesh , by the way . " Perhaps he 's got the word wrong ? " The gift pot they sent to me in London . Came from the museumin Teheran , I think , originally . It 's in that box there . I 've filled it with British biscuits , for Madame . " " Biscuits . You brought biscuits . Dear Mr. Beel , she is insane about them . Bloomingdale 's has never enough . You must tell her at once . " " After you tell me . " But the old man 's coy . It 's none of his doing . He belongs to Madame . The pot  --  that amuses him . " Manoucher arranged for it , no doubt . " " He does what his Soraya tells him , these days . " A sly look . He glances at the door at the top of the stairs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . Like to everyone else . Eh ? Even to me . " A glance at his remarkablegold watch . He smooths it , turning his wrist for the caress . DownstairsWert had noticed some of them still swinging the old-style worrybeads . " So tell me your instinct . I maybe have mine . " " Okay . I 'm to be  --  the American connection  --  right ? " " Eh . Ah . " He is overwhelmed . " That is smart . Yes . Like with the pot . Right . " Thumbing his lip he looks long at Wert , eyes wide . " Ri-ight . " Wert 's not sure of it . But he 's tired of these colloquies in front of closed doors , instead of behind them . He knocks . No immediate answer . " Soraya has a guest , " Fereydoun says over Wert 's shoulder . " This week , from Teheran . Her aunt . And she will not keep a servant . Or not Madame 's . " They hear steps , voices , women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " From his breath , the old man chews coriander . " You will not believe . Manoucher ... Soraya , his wife , has not yet sleep with him . " The door opens inward to what he first mistakes for a flood of sunshine . Concealed lighting is shafting from all corners , spotted from niches and cornices , or bent in strips . Tinted glass , installed over what must be front windows , is lit from between . Because the ceiling is low , the effect is of a chapel cut in half with the top part missing , people below appearing stubbed . The girl of Manoucher 's picture is before him . Awaits him . That 's the stance . She 's all in black  --  that loose " granny " dress almost to the ankles , with black stockings and sandals , too , which girls on the barricades of anything wear these days , or girls who follow that style ; she could be at a " demo " in Boston , ready top291demonstrate for the environment , or at an incendiary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course . That almost accusatory pallor the political ones seem to get . Some of those types wear handcraft decoration : she lacks even a wedding ring . The neck is goose-long , the brows meet over the nose  --  in the picture these must after all have been plucked , but she 's still handsome , in an offended way . Does n't she speak English ? On the phone , had n't she ? " Manoucher asked me to come . " She bows . Clearly she understands , but they 're ushered further in , seated and offered the ritual bowl of nuts , without a speech . A bowl of pumpkin seeds as well . She 's affecting the mode of the lower classes then ? He realizes he 's very angry  --  it must be for Manoucher . Taking a handful of seeds , he cracks one , spitting the husk into his palm . His tongue remembers its old agility . She 's going over him top to toe , darting intelligences to herself . He cracks and splits . " Will you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " He bows a stiff no . She 's achieved a kind of personal chador , he 's thinking . She 'd doctrinairely unveiled . All over the world they do it , not just Iran , or South America , or here . His friend in japan has a blackstockingwife like this one , tall too in the new-generation way , and by God with the same neck . The censorious way they all dress even has a kind of nineteenth-century force and battling charm . George Sand , Isadora Duncan , come to mind . Poor Manoucher . He spits a husk . " Will you speak French ? She knows American , but does n't want to speak it . " Fereydoun already has the harried air of a go-between trying to pour balm . " She wants me to tell you at once , though , that Bakh has allowed them to read your exchange of letters . She and her aunt . While they were in prison . Her aunt much admires them . And you . " Oh he did , did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Bakh he 's angry at . Friendship is to be used , he himself is no coolly off-hand Northerner . But these people never know where intensity should fall short . He 's never been in prison , of course . " Why wo n't she speak it ? " And who then was the rich-voiced girl on the telephone ? Ferey hesitates . Gets her nodded cue . " She has taken a vow . Until  --  " He gets a shake of her head . " A vow . " Insufferable . Wert gets up . " Full of vows , is n't she . " She turns pink , a little . Now his choler 's been released he can feel sorry . Poor things , they 've always had to use their body-wiles . Even in the act of freeing themselves , they hang onto the method . He wanders over to a row of black boxes and instrument panels which interest him , a whole row of ebony gadgetry set underneath thep292stained-glass windows . On the window seat , which runs the perimeter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there 's a red catalogue , open face down . Hammacher Schlemmer 's Instant Phone Order Gift Catalogue . Fascinated , he tracks what must be her purchases , none yet installed . Among them he notes a Spilhaus Space Clock " showing sun and moon positions , constellations , high tide and low , moonrise and set , Mean Solar Time and ordinary " ; beyond it something called Marketline  --  " place your phone on terminal and get 7,000 stocks and options only 15 min. behind the tape " ; a conference telephone amplifier ; an automatic paper-shredder ; and a cordless electric telephoneindex " accommodating one hundred and seventy names "  --  on which are inscribed two . He 's aghast at what his country can provide a foreigner ardent for mechanization . But already mounted on the wall is something simpler , a Song Bird thermometer , a silly eighteen-inch disc with huge numbers and " birds in natural colors , " which jolts his sympathies . It may be made in Western Germany and sold here , but those reds and blues and birds were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave , " Fereydoun is breathing behind him . " But it is only on this condition Bakh gets her out . And she is good girl  --  she makes modern home for Manoucher . Please come back to chair . " " Very modern . " The doodled Farsi script on the telephone pad is familiar , but he has n't time to place it . In his ear a whisper : " Manouch  --  she is really soft for him . Since before he is here . But she has pride , she wanted not to get out of prison like this . Also  --  there is Madame . Who wish them to live in Switzerland . " " Madame knows all this ? " " With us , what one woman does not know , the others tell her . " Never seeing when it 's time to give up gossip and stand together ? At times he fancies that women in search of autonomy need a male coordinator . This is a big room , obviously made of several small ones . Can she hear them across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her younger black . Such a yackety sort her people are when together , yet he 's often seen one of them apart like this , sitting in silence as if in extra air . She 's watching them . Growing strong under their audience ? A harem-habit , he thinks . Will it make for more tenacious female revolutionaries than we have in the West ? " She really wo n't speak English then ? " Ferey throws up his hands . " She has Ph.D . in it . In speech . And I must shop all over New York with her as interpreter . She say Fateh is not the right modern for her . Except at the drugstore. "  |p293Wert  ca n't help laughing . " She 's right . " Suddenly she whirls round at Fereydoun . " Tell him . " In Farsi . A flood of it comes from her , too fast for Wert . Slowing , she addresses him lesson-style . Fereydoun , frowned over by those furry brows of hers , gives verse for verse : " She does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ff-augh . " Wert ca n't help himself . " At first , she swore not to speak it until you Americans left . " Wert shrugs . " Now she finds she does n't want to speak it here . " Fereydoun shakes his head over her next sentence . But Wert has already heard it . She wishes she 'd never learned American . She hates it here . " But when she goes back  --  for the regime will change again , she says  --  they 'll have to let her speak it if she wants to , teach the others even . " Same like coming out of chador , she hisses to Fereydoun , her lip trembling . I miss chador , even . But it is my right . . . . Do n't tell him this . Fereydoun looks from one to the other ; bows his head . " Oh my poor bitch  --  " Wert 's already said under his breath . What a mix-up . He walks back to the chair in front of hers , sits , almost takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Speak in French , you two , " the old man says . " Go on . " Or break down into Farsi ? Though probably he could n't keep up with her . Besides , she 's the kind of girl who on her own makes men feel hostile ; it 's not her ideas . " Soyez bienvenue " =he begins . But he ca n't hack it ; he , too , has his pride . " Came here to say that , you know . To offer what I can . But this is my country . What it offers is in American . " She does have a glare . May even shine in the dark . Still , it 's a wonder her Iranian husband has n't got his rights from her . It 's the old man who explodes . Get on with it , girl . We 're not here to see you alone , remember ? To Wert he says , " I 'm hungry . And it 's almost time out there . " He titters . " For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be done . In a hurry is better . Remember  --  what you and she both owe Bakh . She does n't hurry . Everybody always owes Bakh . The old guy stamps his foot . This one will owe too , she adds , staring at Wert . I did not admire those letters . Shrugging , she stands up , clasping her arms in front of her . So be it . It 's the gesture of the chador . Standing in front of Wert , she 's not as tall as the dark dress presents her . Is this man worth it ? she flings over her shoulder . Then straight up into Wert 's eyes-. - I spend my life to watch . Her eyes are the brilliant Kurdish blue which sometimes travels east into Aierhaijan . Suddenlyp294she breaks her stare with a princess clap of hands , opening her mouth wide . Her yell splits just past him . For a minute he sees horse and cavalry in his head , and raised sabers , then a door to the next room opens and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sees no feet ; this one is the floating kind the superior ones used to be . She 's shaking her old head at Fereydoun . She wo n't . I can not force her . She wo n't wear the black . The old man makes a sign . The woman wheels , catches sight of Wert , gives a shriek , spits a word at Soraya and turns her back , covering her face . " Madame 's bodgi , Mr. Beel , " the old guy says . " Pardon . She did not know any man but me was here . Now , Soraya , now . Tell the woman to bring her in now . Time 's short . Forgive me , Mr. Wert . " He mutters to the servant . She does n't move . You old fool , Soraya says to Fereydoun , not turning her head . She 's staring at Wert . Irish eyes , he used to pretend them , in the mountainshadowof the Elburz . Sometimes a woman showed only one . You old fool . Your Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could he ever have thought this girl was  --  whatever he had thought her ? " Vows are vows , Mr. Wert . But I also promised Bakhtiary . " In English her voice is different , though it 's not the voice heard on the phone . " I bring you a gift from him . " She purses her mouth . Is she going to kiss  --  do they now ? In Iran he was celibate . Flying occasionally to Thailand , where he had a girl , or when he could afford it , to Berlin . Most of the Iranian girl-students had had generals or other officials for fathers . He 'd succeeded in thinking of even the westernized ones as shower-curtained from ear to floor . But the real anti-aphrodisiac had been their sna C+ ed minds . She whistles . Pee00000euuuuuupewi . No , a whistle ca n't be annotated . Call it the warning scratch a prince 's cleats made , climbing up the glass mountain . When he should be hell-bent in the opposite direction . There 's a scuffle and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then a girl saunters from it  --  at first glance the kind of American girl he 's just seen in Washington , or on the prinking streets of nearby Georgetown , airing along on white-stockinged legs which end in those fuzzy pink anklets and childish splat sandals , in just such a short skirt , too , and pink turtleneck , her head shining like a sheared button . A bag swings from her shoulder . Seeing Wert she freezes , as if she had n't expected to see him in the spot where he is . She 's not a patch on Manoucher 's wife for dramatic presence but informally prettier , in a candid way which might almostp295be American . She wears makeup , he sees , when she comes to stand in front of him . But she 's certainly Iranian ; the nose has the exact curve of Soraya 's , though a freckle or two masks that . Now she 's flushing , head bent . Perhaps she , too  --  like Bakh 's bride-to-be  --  is only just out of chador . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as to a younger sister . " Az molaqat e soma xeyli xosvaqt am  --  I 'm very glad to meet you . " Why does everybody look frightened but pleased ? " The other Soraya , " Fereydoun says ceremoniously . " She was born the same year as Manoucher 's Soraya here . And named the same . So that is what we call her . " Not a sister then . " Your half-sister ? " Manoucher 's wife slips her arm around the girl 's waist . They 're of a height , but it 's hard to believe them of an age . Though marriage has n't fattened Manoucher 's wife , it has filled in certain psychic outlines , as marriage does even if unconsummated . He sees now that though the other girl must n't look her age , she 's no teenager . Only unmistakably single . Manoucher 's wife 's smiling at him again . " No . My aunt . " Behind them all the door from the stairs opens , admitting Madame . She halts there , appearing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only toting a saddlebag instead of a gun . She bows to Manoucher'swife , who barely bows back . Slowly one woman after another files through the door , until Madame 's surrounded by a thick circle of them ; half the women from the other apartment must be here , at least thirty . In the stagey colored light they loom like a tribunal focused on him ; what 's he done ? Their jewels flash red , green and blue with primarypower , and with a holy white . Is this an auto-da-fe  --  for his being American ? It 's as they trot forward on their high heels , herded in by grim Madame  --  butbreaking up into their twos and threes because they 're women and instinctively make any line a confab , that the truth comes on him , along with the shock that the name doodled twice on the telephone pad is his own . Just so , walking with a crony , one dusk in Tabriz , they 'd met up with a clump of women , a perfumed cloud of them in chadors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blank , knockered doors in the long , continuous wall that concealed the houses , all with sizable courtyards , which made up that section of the city . The crony , a high-ranking clerk at his own Embassy , had excitedly bulled him back . " My sister I'arvin  --  this is the third time those women have visited her-a very fine family . In our country the women pick thep296bride . This visit means yes . Better we not go in after all . She 'll be making tea for them . " As they 'd walked on to an ordinary teahouse , where women were of course not admitted , a fact he knew as well had come upon him more forcibly . All along the wall , the brass knockers were women 's hands . The groom ?  --  Wert had asked his companion . Oh , the women may bring him along , next time . Had the groom and the girl ever met ? Oh yes , at the university . They like each other . We 're not that old-fashioned . Mehrdad 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , untouched by tobacco . " But when it 's time for ritual , we revert . Do n't you people do the same ? " Wert wished hard and sudden for his cousin , far away in a big old house now only a block from a gas station , yet in a town where certain people still did just that . Ordering the traditional magnolias from the florist if necessary  --  as had been done at his **35;10194;TOOLONG wedding  --  and tying them into the trees . He could telephone to ask her opinion , which she always gave overpoweringly . Cousin  --  under the circumstances , am I the bride , or the groom ? Better still , he could fly there . Away . On second thought , he 'd rather not let his cousin know . Women fester toward a wedding , their very skin irritated by the sight of the male in the single state . His best gambit , the only decent one , is to be stupidly polite . Speak to the aunt . " Do you  --  speak English ? " Wert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two girls , who look uncomfortable . Nor Fereydoun , who glances at his watch  --  and who may have an understandable lack of interest in weddings . " Do n't fuss , Ferey , " Madame says in French . " That damnable program'sbeen delayed another hour . Paris just telephoned . " To Wert she says in English : " My husband 's wedding will be broadcast from Isfahan , but on the  --  the  --  what is it , girls ? " Manoucher 's wife does n't answer her mother-in-law . Her neck grows an inch . The aunt tucks in her chin , modestly . " Satellite . " The women purr admiration , passing the English word like a ball . He wants to clap . " Machines , tous les deux , my nieces , " Madame says . " This one "  --  she points to her daughter-in-law  --  " a speech machine . And the other Soraya  --  what are you , hmrn ? "  |p297Wert  waits , fascinated . That beautiful dove-voice , the voice of the phone , what 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as one does in her country when young , subordinate , yet admitting a fact to one 's credit . " Computer programmer . " " Are they not beautiful together ! " bursts from one of the women . His ears burn . Fateh rescues him . " Brought up together , Mr. Wert , all their lives ! " A humming from the women . He recalls the cronies , their moist-eyed tales of masculine devotion . Are these girls the new-style heroines ? " Did you say  --  nieces ? " Over there behind Madame , everyone giggles . Seems he ca n't make a wrong response . Fereydoun intervenes . " It 's very simple . " But he 's grinning . " The other Soraya 's mother is Manoucher 's Soraya 's grandmother , married at twelve . The grandmother and her own daughter  --  Manoucher 's Soraya'smother , had these two girls the same year , the grandmother first . The father of the other Soraya happens to be Madame 's real brother . The father of Manoucher 's Soraya is the half-brother of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-brother was actually only adopted into that family , being the son of the second wife 's dead sister . So Manoucher 's wife is only an adopted niece ; Madame made very sure of it . " " Otherwise my grandson might know all the parts of speech and still be an idiot , " Madame murmurs rapidly . " When he arrives . " " Otherwise  --  " Fateh raises a ruby-nailed finger , pointing to the girl , we would have send her first . As the aunt ... and so talented , Mr. Wert . " " Bakh ? He would have sent Manoucher both of them , " Madame says gloomily . " Lucky , your country does not allow . " " Madame does not approve , " Fereydoun says . " Of the old Islamic marriage . You may recall her family modernized it . " A silence . Everybody 's recalling . Shah . No need to say it . Shah . " And Reza Shah , " Wert says . " You do n't approve of more than one wife ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The shadow from her false lashes cross-hatches her pupils , reminding him of the x cartoonists used to put in the eyes of a character meant to be blotto . Under all her beige , yes , that other woman . Only an Arabic answer is possible . " Madame Fateh  --  qisma  --  Kismet , gave me only one . " An abdominal groan from the ladies . Ile wo n't dare turn toward theirp298starry expanse , agreeing now with what Bakh used gravely to tell him : Chador is a protection for the man . What 's Ferey 's allegiance , to men or women ? To neither probably ; that 's his value . " Bakh 's new wife , is she of the family , too ? " He 's managed to say something wrong at last . " She is of Ardebil . As one can see . " Fereydoun confides , buttonhole to buttonhole . A sudden keening from Manoucher 's wife . " I did not want to leave prison first . She makes me . " Palms outstretched toward the other Soraya , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . " We came into that prison nearly together ; we should leave together . " Her eyes are shut . Two drops squeeze from them , and a tiny voice from below . " Because she knows I am soft for Manoucher . Yes , it is true . Go , ' she says . She is already getting too old for children she says . Already six months older than me , almost twenty-five . " She opens her eyes . The other Soraya closes hers . They hang onto each other like a pair of just-revealed caryatids waiting for the archaeologist 's pick . " So I say  --  I will wait . I will not have children . Until she , too , comes to America . ' " They remind him of his young cronies of yore . A touch of Damon and Pythias , the complications of the womb notwithstanding . Attacks of adolescent vowing  --  whose attitudinizings used to strike silvery shadowsin his samovar . He ca n't seem to remember that those two have been in prison . Prison , riot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from him . As does his own possible role here . What 's operating here is the clan , that engine always running during either the light or the dark of lives lived within its enclosure . He wants to get nearer it . Even if it burns . At this moment , everyone 's ignoring him for what 's being revealed . Not that they did n't already know . But now the clan 's obligatory scene is upon them . For Madame is muttering to Fereydoun , in schoolgirl German . " To think . To think  --  that to ransom those two , Bakh let those Schweine have his last two opium fields . " " Shhh . Hold dein Mund . " Wert gives no indication of having overheard . The special myopia of those who use a whispered other language as the last resort of intimacy always amuses him . " I was just telling Madame , " Fereydoun says , switching to English , " that her daughter-in-law really adores her . Adores you and admires you , Madame . What 's she done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " You 'll say it anyway . What has n't he said to us , Mr. Wert . In the years he 's managed us . " And how they smile at each other , the servility perfectly balancing the complicity . " Then , I 'll say it . Madame  --  what 's Manoucher 's Soraya done to him but copy what you did  --  to Bakh ? " " Das war personlich ! Nicht Radicalismus ! " Whether it was personal or radical , she likes being reminded of it . " But are those girls really  --  " Wert says . " Of course , country to country , radicalism changes . " " In my country , Mr. Wert , if you are in prison , then you are radical . How nice you speak German , too . " They watch her join the two girls , who are surrounded by the women . " Yes , how nice , " Fereydoun whispers doubtfully . " For your information , Manoucher 's wife was sent to prison for writing something . A lecture  --  about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifesto . " He shrugs . " And one more university riot . But the other Soraya  --  she 's been against the mullahs from the beginning . And that 's serious . She ca n't go back . " " So  --  Bakh 's really out of opium now ? " Or again ? He 'll hear nothing good of the old man from now on . The clan being the clan . " Ah  --  those fields were earmarked for Madame . Part of her  --  settlement . He 'll compensate her . He now has interests in outer space . " Fereydoun pets his watch , soothing it like a cat . " Not everyone can arrange a broadcast by satellite . " He smiles at the word ; his manner is loosening , his English , too . " The other Soraya  --  she 's his favorite . " He 's scarcely moving his lips . " We think  --  he tried to marry her . To get her out of prison , of course . But he wanted to . " Wert stands rigid . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prison ? " But Madame 's already at his elbow , shepherding the girl . " She is very like your American girls , non , M'sieu Wer  --  ike all our girls , she knows for the household  --  but like yours she is also modernly talented . The specialite computer is very chic , non ? But of course she can have children  --  if it is wanted . She is not like some . " A glance at her daughter-in-law . And at Fereydoun . " It is understood  --  she would remain the only wife . But she is also so American she wish to choose her own husband . " Madame 's giggle rumbles in bronze . " She is very hard on us . We are supposed to arrange . Mechanic , you went even to prison to avoid us . Ilah ! And then what happens , naughty girl ? "  |p300All  the women sigh . Or a good many of them . He dare n't look to see . " Quand meme , m'sieu , a lovely thing happen . " Madame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ la chance , this girl . She fall on her feet anywhere . We are tres embarrasse but we are all agree , non ? " A murmur from the others . " She is fallen in love , Mr. Wert . With your letters to B'akh . " The other Soraya is looking at him steadily . Her face is carved farther past youth than the prettiness he first saw : she can well be twenty-five . Why should that hearten him ? When he ca n't bear those pink socks . " They invited you early , Mr. Wert , " she says . " Stop pretending to look at your watch , Fereydoun , you know it was n't to be until four . And we all know who gave you the watch . " All the while staring at Wert , her lashes unwavering . Her lip does n't tremble . " Mr. Wert  --  I 'll just give you what I have for you from Bakh . " Even in the black that Manoucher 's wife wanted to put her in , she would n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help the revolution either . Though there are black circles under her eyes . So she was against the mullahs from the beginning  --  bright girl , if he can believe it . All that will have to be sorted out later . But if she herself 's had a hand in this charade , it 'll be doomsday before he 'll know . What dignity , in either case . An idea occurs to him , on how to save both their faces . What she 'll have for him  --  in the ritual way they like to make wreaths of past friendship  --  will be the letters . Abide by the ritual then . Save her face , poor smart , muddled girl , prisoner of more than revolutions  --  and save his own skin . For in spite of all their effort , they know he 's not the suitor here . His cousin has not applied for him . " Then , if there 's time  --  " Wert said . " I 've come a long way . Perhaps  --  " he turns properly to Madame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " How ridiculous  --  she 's not a sixteen-year-old , to be made to show her jejune accomplishments . Head bent , she 's swaying a little . Well , he wo n't ask her to sing . Or to dance . Immediately he 's ashamed of himself . Manoucher 's wife is hovering anxiously near the girl , who says palely , " I came far , too . From Isfahan , day before yesterday . " " And before that  --  " Manoucher 's wife cries , but is hushed by the girl 's hand . " Hush  --  " the girl says in Farsi . " You owe me nothing . Ah , Soraya , its not each other we owe . Or even Bakhtiary . " The Farsi cadence does n't change her . Not like it does the others . " And he owes us nothing , " she says , looking at Wert . " In prison , any letter is precious . It 's from the outside . " " When were you let out ? " He speaks in Farsi.  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A  --  month ? I had no calendar . " " And three days . Manoucher flew her at once to the hospital in Shiraz . But she had bad dreams there . Then to Isfahan . " " I have no bad dreams in prison . I know what I am doing there . " She 's shaking , now . Wert puts out a hand . She fends him off . " It 's nothing . " " Isfahan  --  " He ca n't help himself . " You saw Bakhtiary . " " I  --  saw him . Y-yes . " Her teeth are chattering ; is it ague ? Malaria ? " Ex-ruse me . I have pill for this . " She slides the shoulder bag down , slowly , painfully opening it , moving constrictedly to take the glass of water the servant 's already slipping her . So they know what the trouble is , then . The pill she extracts and swallows is n't big enough for quinine . Fereydoun asks low : " You dreamed in Isfahan ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open the bag again , it comes to him . They whip them there . She 's been whipped . Out of the bag comes a letter  --  but only one , and not his handwriting . He recognizes the familiarstationery . An envelope like it is still on his mantel in London . What else can there be , to bring ? A box , a small , red morocco box . How small , to travel so far . Farther than either he or she . Beautiful , Bakhtiary said in Venice , the only time Wert ever saw him shy . It came out so very beautiful , that mask , I had one made for myselfAnd better than a gravestone . Wert is reaching for it when the girl topples forward . Fereydoun catches her first , in his long , eighty-yearoldarms . The box with jenny 's death mask in it , eluding all their fingers , has been dropped . No one will ever be able to say by whom . They 've laid the girl face-down on the cushioned seat which borders the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back except the servant . The back of the pink turtleneck is stained wet and glaucous . " Not blood , what is it ? " Fateh whispers . Manoucher 's wife , bending over it , tosses back her head , agonized but proud . The sweater is slowly peeled off by the servant . Fateh , chafing the girl 's wrists , moans like a cat . The girl 's back rises and falls . The upper back is half scab , here and there oozing . Below , the healed small-of-the-back is like rose-colored leather.  --  The hot plate , " Manoucher 's wife says loudly . " The dastband e gapani they put her in , first . Handcuffs from over the shoulder . The night they bring her in , the electricity is off our part of the prison . And iii the room where they use the grill . So they use coal-fire , and iron door . Shiraz hospital say she 's lucky . From the grill , you can not have skin grafts. "  |p302Across  that breathing body , Madame touches her daughter-in-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Madame . But twice . " " So that is why Manoucher . Why you refuse him . " " Oh no , Madame . I do n't refuse him altogether . Not from the back . " Swiftly the daughter-in-law turns her back to them all , kneels forward , and flips up her loose blouse . The lash marks , crossed vertically and horizontally , are perfectly healed . " Madame ! Watch out ! " Fateh tries to pry Madame 's nails from her own pearl string . " Jalel . Moron . Let me be . " Madame 's hands tug at the heavy rope . She drops to her knees in a shower of beads . Beside her the two exposed girlish backs form a ruined folio , opened at the worst page . Next to Wert , a nickering begins , a flute choking higher and higher . Fereydoun is tittering . He grasps his throat , squeezing the hysteria he ca n't stop . Mir-li-li-iiiiii-ton  --  ton . Gagging , he stops in front of Wert , the tears sprouting from his begging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one long worn hand from behind the chador , crack , crack , on each smooth-powdered cheek . Fereydoun drops in a crouch , head down , arms hanging , heavy convulsive intakes . . . whooped breath ... chip chip a-chip . . . and at last silence . " Madame usually does it for him , " the serving woman whispers . Above the veil her brows are grizzled , the lids papery . The blunt bazaar accent cackles . " He ca n't stand the sight of a chicken being cut into even ; it 's natural . " Madame kneels in her purple sweater behind the exposed wounds of the two girls , all three bowed as toward a prie-dieu . The other Soraya sits up , turning between the other two clasping women , her eyes still closed . The breasts that face Wert are unscarred , rose-swollen , milkywhite . Fateh , swooping down upon her with a harem screech , covers the girl with a scarf . But unmistakably , he 's been allowed a glimpse of her . The old servant , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pearls . Fereydoun takes him by the arm . The aisle of women at the door , parting for him , gives off sparkles of gold tissue , black glitter , red-tinted black hair . Throwing off Fereydoun 's arm , he retrieves the letter , which he stuffs in a side pocket  --  and the small box , which he cradles in both hands . They know it contains Jenny ; he 's sure of it . Blinking their mica eyelids they stand like sad eagles either side of a pyramid whose old marriage door he 's expected to reenter . Making an apologetic cringe with his box , he passes them . The bathroom Ferey leads him to is the women 's . Two sunken tubsp303are separated by a broad ledge massed with tall vats of powder and bath salts , loofahs and towels , articles for the hair , all a replica of what one heard their finer bathhouses at home used to be . Fereydoun , at the toilet , is modestly slow at opening his pants . Wert turns his back . The note from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in hand . " Last letter . One sentiment . It 's time . " Scrawled beneath is an ankh . Time for both of them . But he ca n't open the box , shrinking even from shaking it , to hear whether the old plaster-of-Paris has broken . The face inside already clings to his fingertips . Wish I felt nothing . Wish I felt something . Which is true ? " Shall I take care of that for you ? " Ferey , washing his hands with a great yellow ball of heady-scented soap , regards him equivocally . To guard it ? Or to destroy ? Smart equerry , he 's not saying . Casually , Ferey seizes an atomizer and sprays his jowl . He 's at home here . Leave it to him . What better than to leave the past , seamless or smashed , to an old eunuch who knows what his trade is : certain peculiar services . Wert passes him the box , and is freed to urinate , to use the soap  --  to share any of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compromise  --  which must always have been the value of eunuchs . A diplomat ca n't compete . He nods . " Probably you have closets galore . " Along the way back to the main apartment , the notes archways , tilings and cushionings subtly Middle East . Even the windows have been heightened and made mosquelike . But where they are n't draped the view is of dismally gimcrack low roofs , or that palely transitional modern brick which ca n't seem to make a firm imprint on space . " But why are we here , you 're asking  --  " Fereydoun says , " in this neighborhood ? Everybody asks . " " Quite . " " Bakhtiary did n't want us to shine out . Now  --  it does n't matter . " " Because he 's dying ? " " Because we 're all in this country now . Or  --  whoever can be . " " Bakhtiary would never come . I invited him . " " No . He would never come . " " Even to Manoucher ? " Perhaps he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so pale . " Will you excuse me , Heel . Only a moment . " On their left there 's a small room , door open , with a window on another vista  --  east . Fereyp304leaves the door ajar . There in the middle of the room , he 's salaaming . No doubt about it ; he 's praying . Their movements make them supple beyond what Western devotions generally do for one . When he emerges he 's noncommittal , but blowing his nose . The main room 's walls are a dazzle of rugs , making it one of their Arabian-nights enclosures . Now its deep burnishment sickens him . These rugs know too well the mahogany that blood turns to . Under their woolen astronomy of charming animal alembic and arboretums flattened for foot or eye , too often that spongy wound-color . Yet the inhabitants of this always migrant oasis can still thrall him . Crammed now on folding chairs , they 're no longer his or a newspaper 's invention . Their bank accounts have been streaming ahead of them for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and schooling the children here , yet he ca n't imagine them on the world 's choppingboardlike other people ; he ca n't see them as ever settling in . This tent of theirs floats with them , always perfectly aligned  --  and landing anywhere . Up there on one side of the room Bakh presides on screen in his gnarled garden , armed for entry into the oldest eternity , with childbrideand at his feet a dish of sand , scrawled with religion . On the opposite wall there is now a hugely ready video installation  --  no doubt sent the way a five-pound box of candy " from your local merchant " used to be , by a conglomerate . Merely one of the contradictions daily exploding around the world , which any dutiful newscaster would report . Yet would such a reporter see what it is more than money which joins that beaky woman over there in her pared Paris black , that tailcoatedpatriarch who looks about to address the whole chattering family-weddingcrowd yet is never seen to speak , Madame herself , just settling her own group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in haircuts and jackets which ask for blond heads not black , and their awkwardly frothy girl counterparts  --  all the way down to the bright infant dots on a shoulder or a lap ? Except for their servants there 's not a chador among them , or any remnant trace of the beads and saddles of the old donkey culture . Over the last seventy-five years most of these people would n't have slept toeing a brazier or even in the more formal quiltings but in beds importedfrom the West , and their Cartier jewelry may be thieved from them at the best hotels , yet they 're joined to the old bodgi and her vast peasanthood by what they all share . A shallow jube of understanding runs through them all like that old water ditch of theirs , in the way that same dirty old life support used to frame their cities  --  and must still linkp305their villages . The remarkableness of the jube was its shallowness , in which , stared into long enough , all their human commerce became clear . He must always have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him is that he may always have wanted it . Up there on the grainy screen at his left , in that garden picture of erotic duties to self and who knows what obligations to truths greater than the self , his old friend 's expression , that dignified alertness to advantage , has n't changed . But did we in the Department ever considerwhat Bakh meant by advantage ? " Where 'd you prefer to sit , Mr. Beel ? " Not with the men . Their poker-faced swapping dries up at his approach ; he 'll learn nothing . Where are his own letters to Bakh now ? The daughter-in-law does n't admire them ; he 'd be interested to know why ; he admires her . A man would always know where he stood with her . Madame and she are now on the dais , facing the crowd , where many of the women cling separate in the old style , leaving an admixture of couples of all ages , including several striking young pairs got up like internationally gilded statuary , and those few hormonally neuter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He does n't see the girl . The aunt . " Let 's sit at the back . " Fereydoun hesitates . " You Americans . Such democrats . " Near the staircase to Manoucher 's apartment is a short row of emptieswhich must be reserved for the servants ; two in chador are already atits farther end . He and Fereydoun seat themselves at the other . " Who 's that tall guy  --  he going to speak ? " " Our former charge d'affaires . No  --  he 's just  --  " " Showing himself . " Always a lot of that , anywhere in government . Power emeritus , among the displaced . " I suppose  --  Bakh wo n't speak ? " " The marriage ceremony does not require it . " Fereydoun 's one hand , crumpling restlessly ; opens to show a string of worry-beads , a fine one , small evenly worn globes of some cloudy quartz over which the thumb can move contentedly . At first sight of such beads , one might think them rosaries , but their use had been laic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a social admission that men must fiddle . In Iran , a colleague trying to use them to help break his cigarette habit had found them useless to someone lacking their intricate vocabulary of social reference . They were a habit always significantly of ' the background , and always masculine . He 'd heard it was considered lower class to swing them . " I'he cultivated could make them seem a sensuous pursuit , not a nervous one . They werep306old-fashioned now . Bakh had never used worry-beads . Or never in front of Westerners . But Fereydoun 's watch must not be enough for him . " And Manoucher . . . will it be dangerous for him to show himself ? " Never mind , he thinks , watching the beads slide , jerk and slide . " Do n't bother to explain , Fereydoun . There 's no logic in revolution . " Not even in history . We only lead ourselves to expect it . That is how we intellectuallylive  --  even the illiterate . Wert glanced at the two serving-maids . Maybe those most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensed the regime was falling , only to let the boy align himself with it  --  and now mending his own fences with the holy men , must have known this from the beginning . It 's all a walking-on eggs , he 'd written . Between versions of that greediest of all egalitarians , Bill  --  the natural ape . There 's no logic but compensation . That 's what these people know best . The old equerry 's now looking at him in such open pain that he half wants to take him in his arms . " The bride , Mr. Beel  --  " he says in his high voice , " she does n't need to speak either . " Wert sat . Terrible to see a man of that age pacify himself , a revolution , and God knows what all , with a canny string of amethysts . In Wert 's own heavy daytime brogues his toes spread , seeking surface , and delicately retract . " I know . They 're sent . " Fereydoun got up . " It 's beginning . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitation of images has begun  --  a house , a garden torchlighted , major-domos and waiters , food tables at fresco , and a trickle of guests in evening dress  --  from the embassies ? Farther behind is a sombercrowd , more solidly packed , from which the camera skitters back to tables stiff as cardboard , the food still unattacked . Whether the camerais badly maneuvered or psuedo-artistic is moot . " Wait . What is that place ? " " The hospital . In Isfahan . " " And that ? " Wert points to Bakh in his chair and the leaning girl . " Their house in Teheran . " " When ? " " When ? Why , I suppose when the girl first came . Some time ago . ... But that up there . That 's the hospital all right . The garden , yes . " He leans forward judiciously . He must have been a palace man all his life . " I 'll leave you now . My place is with Madame . But , Mr. Beel  --  that staircase behind you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the maids can show you out . " He flicked an eye toward them . " If you must fly . "  |p307So  they 've tried  --  is he admitting ? Starting all the way from London , or even earlier , from those palace reserves of obligation where they store people like Wert . Where ever since Venice , he must have been kept . If he stays , what a confidant this Fereydoun could make . Mere colleagueslike Nosy pale beside him  --  and his clan . " I liked the boy , " Wert said . " Boy ? Manoucher ? " Is Fereydoun going to titter again ? Instead , a surprisingly heavy fist comes down on Wert 's shoulder . " He was there . " The lights dim as he leaves , a genie receding . Except for the two maids on the row , who do n't count , Wert 's left to himself for the first time . So abrupt is the plunge back into this familiar , slow-breathing , cud-in-the-mouth self of his when in crowds , that he examines it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cul-de-sac from which Bakhtiary , with ambush if necessary , hopes to rescue him ? Around him , conversation 's not fading . Their sense of attention is different , requiring constant formal annotation aloud . Very out loud or very hush-hush ; that 's how they live , not much middle ground to them . He 's all middle ground , Bakhtiary 's told him . His country 's taught him to be . Oh there 's ashcan violence in your cities , Wert , stifled mass murder in your suburbs . And political murder , if you can call what 's random or mad " political . " Bakhtiary ca n't . All Wert 's own aggression , he 's pointed out , is now in his country 's bombs , and all his once valuable personal secrecy . Your bombsights are now your people 's chief organs of meditation . What barbarians you 're teaching us to be . There 'd been a convention of Western philosophers at the TeheranHilton ; Bakhtiary had wondered why . " Maybe to observe our code of violence , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lopped off , here and there . A mild thumbscrew , to clear a man 's head so that he may perhaps keep it . Or a skin-peeling , to correct a woman 's . How civilized  --  to be able to suffer personally for one 's views ! There our women are even more equal than yours . They guard our secrets , you know , like the Pentagon does yours . So we must guard them . " On the video screen , Bakhtiary himself is now advancing . The short , sturdy feet plant themselves steadily as the camera travels forward . Wert ca n't see the backs of them . Bakh 's wearing one of the deep black suits of thinnest silk which they used to affect in the worst heat for formal occasions . Here iii Queens in snow weather , some of the men are wearing them . In that blazing garden of ' the still photograph at the left , Bakh 's suit is white  --  for engagement time ? The video garden on thep308right-hand screen is a nighttime one , but well illuminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Though even so , a viewer may be struck with certain cliche album conclusions on the passage of time , The announcer comes on , to a low spate of " Ahs ! " from the audience ; he 's a young Iranian whom many of them know from Paris . Speaking English with an Oxford accent interspersed with French , he ripples out a long list of Bakh 's credits :  --  industrial magnate , adviser to the new regime . On that pause , the camera shifts . The ayatollah is coming forward . The audience sighs . " Ah , that one . " We progress from comfort to comfort , Wert thinks . This mullah 's name is n't yet known to Wert or his newspapers , but he is plainly an important one . His wrappings shine powerfully , properly subordinating the face , which appears to listen impassively . This is Mr. Bakhtiary 's third marriage . Though his holdingsare in the most modern industries , and he is expected to help regularize the regime 's management of these , he himself has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And perhaps he has . With such scant outward change . Ninety years , what has he done with them ; what 's been done to him ? Is that jaw slightly swollen , or merely thrust forward ? The necktie loosened ? Peoplehere are murmuring what people do ; the tenderest audience ca n't help scavenging . " Those dark glasses , I wish he would take them off . " Everybody wants him to look at him or her personally . So does Wert . The bride is from a family prominent in Ardebil . At last , a shot of the bride , in heavy white and a headdress , surrounded by women , somewhereinside the house . Silence . Then a cry from the dais : " Yes , her father has a string of sweet-shops , very prominent . " Fateh is made to shut up , not without laughter . His eyes are getting used to the partial light ; he can see Madame . She 's shed her sweater set at last for a gown which should glitter when she moves . It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He tries to imagine his mother , separated for half a lifetime from his father , presiding in public acknowledgment of his father 's remarriage . With these people , though , it 's not remarrying  --  while we 'll continue to say that even when a man is on his eighth wife . For them it 's been onwardmarrying , as much for clan as for the man . Gallinaceous birds , we are  --  Bakh had once informed him . Look it up , pal . He had to . Ordinary domestic fowl . But what Westerner , if reported this , would honor it ? Minutes ago he was hungry , now hunger 's gone , down wherever other intensities send it . He ca n't name what these are , except that his chest seems to be surgically widening . There 's always the staircase , ifp309coming alive gets too much for him . Glancing along the row , he notes that the nearer chador is wearing dark glasses , a Western modesty . He 's never seen those with a chador . Another reportable fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's placing a tray of sand molded into hieroglyphs similar to those etched in the sand of the tray at the feet of Bakh and his girl in the still photo . Now the real Bakhorthe one moving on video , is seating himself . As the camera advances , a third tray can be seen on the screen , in front of Bakhtiary 's chair . The trinity of them  --  in still , on video and one actually here on the floor before them all  --  is eerie past ritual , suggesting a fourth dimension behind all these submissive replicas . Bakh , the real Bakh , is now looking out at them here . Behind him is the real scene . Is he noting the differ-ences ? There ca n't be many relatives up there in that sleuth-crowd pressing silently behind Bakhtiary 's chair . For one thing , so many are here . On the other hand , there 's no mullah here . No roses . Not a one ; that 's strange . Queens has florists , flowers . Maybe this crowd has n't yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of him is rapt . The mullah 's now addressing the camera from beside Bakhtiary 's chair , raising his right arm up down , up down . On the mullah 's face , which Wert always thinks of as a single generic one , is the stare that such faces always had there , not inward or meditative but fanatically forward , past the flock itself , toward the letter of the law . Yet always full of secular gall . Wert had never seen one without it . They seem to him the most quick-tempered of man 's priests . Is this one reading the Koran , each time scowling up from a scroll half in his sleeve ? No , he 's calling a roll  --  the names of people here . Each time he pronounces a name , Bakhtiary raises his own hand , in salute . Noises of assent come from the room here  --  an old woman 's long , wan agreement , a boy 's yell , quickly cut off , a man 's sobbing . The mullah is doing it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are silences . Up there on the video , it 's a duel between the two old men wielding their arms , one speaking , one mute . The mullah  --  a talon , a sleeve and a spitting voice protruding from the country those here have left  --  is he excommunicating ? Standing right there , mouthing on , he 's fading ; he 's upstaged . Hossein Bakhtiary , raising and lowering his right arm , on its wrist a watch like Fereydoun 's , in its palm a long-stemmed rose , is winning . And why not ? He 's doing what these here have had to do . He 's saying good-bye . The last of the names , sputtered unintelligibly , almost passes Wert by . Just then , liakh removes his sunglasses . The hand grasping the tea/colored flower moves forward , palm up . The eyes are the same . The mouth , closed until now , opens a swollen hole . Wert can hear its tonguelessgurgle . Buh-Beel . They bring on the bride . Wert wants not to watch . Ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's now no sound from this room , none of the woman-surf which hails a bride . Under the heavy headdress and costume which Ardebil has chosen for her , the slender body opens and closes obediently , a white fan manipulated from behind , twice refusing the gold bracelets offered her , a third time accepting , eyelashes fanned on her cheeks in the one close-up  --  while sugar is sprinkled by one of the two contending retinues , both sides in chador . To sweeten the mother-in-law , the announcer informs , his voice perfunctory . Even the camerais restive , disdaining this secondary creature with her trail of " old custom " dragging behind , and her not-to-be-dwelt-on life ahead  --  whose mother-in-law , dead in childbirth , as Wert happens to know , was a girl her own age , surely sweetened now by ninety years in the grave . A camera is never embarrassed . One more flash for the bride 's " beauty , " whiter than the rest of her , then a close-up  --  of Bakh 's . The lens moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epergnes . The smell from the Queens kitchen mingles with them . All the wedding gifts go to the nation . They are on the longest table of all , in huge assortment , more ransacked than piled . The lens travels at table level , like a child 's eye . " Look  --  Grandpa 's silver samovar ; did we give it ? " a young girl two rows ahead hisses clearly . Finally , the camera traverses the crowd . There , tall as a trophy , between two mullahs , and behind him a third , is Manoucher . Quiet now , not even a sound track humming . Over there in Iran , has noise been confiscated , too ? Wert can hear the separate breathings around him  --  even at the end of his own row , from the nearer chador . The pinwheel up ahead has stopped . A cry then from Manoucher 's wife , from the dais . " Manoucher ! How thin you are . It is only five weeks . " True . That same coat he was wearing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights , it hangs from him in points , like his own flesh running from him . What are the seasons there now ? Tabriz may be under snow , blue-glass afternoon ski slopes , with the brass samovar stuck in a drift . But Isfahan 's warmer . Why 's he wearing that coat ? The camera wo n't answer . It 's scouring the facade of the hospital behind the crowd , running briefly over a plaque showing that I losseinp311Bakhtiary was donor of it , returning frantically to rock past the tables of loot , saying without a word , " Palace to palace , to nation ... loot eternally . " The smell from the kitchen here in Queens is imperative . In the deep iron skittles which they 'll have brought over here whatever else they left , the long-kerneled rice is forming that bottom-crust which will be scooped out like brown lace , to be screamed for by the children , dropped on the plates of the favorite . Left too much longer , it will burn . But up there on the screen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heaped melons , green under the false rays , will warm and rot in memory , or be left forever celadon ; the camera 's done with them . Barging on , it 's pushing Bakhtiary 's chair , now seen to be on wheels , into the hospital facade ; he 's in a room of bright chintz  --  a suite , it is , and once more he 's facing front . His hand no longer holds the rose . The dark glasses are on again . The bride is entering . Where 's her retinue of family women ? Gone . Frantically as a gossip columnist , the camera hunts for them , finding only bowls of roses on tables , underscoring banks of these nodding on the deep windowsills  --  there are roses everywhere ! It probes the dewy heart of one of them , and floating dreamily on , finds the bed . A hospital one . Quickly away  --  though not too quickly . Find the couple who 'll lie on it . In a last roulade of the room , avoiding bric-a-brac now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Bakhtiary braces in his chair , his bride at his side . In the background , stage right , a chador'ed woman is briefly profiled , just entering . A proper royal touch . As the camera drains away , the married pair face it stolidly , like ancestors . It drains them away . An announcer godspeeds them . Ici Telefrance . This is no ordinary wedding babble . People are crowding in front of the dais , hiding it . Wert rises . He ought to leave here . He 's going to learn too much . Six chairs away from him , the nearer chador 's now alone . He 's seeing it through the wrong end of the opera-glass , a minute ago big as life up on the video screen walking through that marriagechamberdoor , then traveling thousands of miles to sit , infinitely reduced , on a folding chair . So that same pattern of dull gray flecked with orange is worn in Isfahan ? How often with dark glasses as well ? Walking over he 's off balance , stepping through arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear such perfume , expensive stuff , no raw musk . Or is he bewitched by video roses ? How right he is to fear machine shadow-play for not even spying , for being only the colorless agent of connection . flow pleased to find it negligent . A camera'sp312thought processes are as ingenuous as a child 's . Its sins of omission have to be similarly forgiven . He stares down at the feet beside his . Pink socks . The chador is silent . Once it was their women 's desert mackintosh . Could they help it if their charms doubled inside it , or if they themselvesdoubled in another sense ? What 's it like inside that tent now , for a girl dressed like any girl from Georgetown ? Blazing with new thoughts , yet still pressed with harem voices ? Under which the muddy current of the dynasts is always creeping anyway , even in the smartly bared flesh of the women he knows . That was n't her doppelganger , up there just now in the honeymoon bedroom , yet somehow arrived here the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Programmer . Satellite . The apersonalprocedures we give these people  --  they emotionalize even those to their own use . Fereydoun said : Manoucher was there . He bends over her . " What we saw and heard just now . It was a tape , was n't it ? " The sunglasses lift . They 're smoke-blue . He can just see her eyes behind them . " Was n't it ? " The chador turns its back . " Why ? " " Bakhtiary  --  wanted it . " " Why ? " He can interrogate like this for hours . The chador hesitates ; it can hear that . " The girl will have child . " There 's no dove-charm in this voice . " She is seven-months . The other picture was the real wedding . " Up ahead , people are finally oozing into the next room , where the baked meats must be . He can wait for the gossips he 'll find there , unsure himself whether his revulsion is from cancer or death , or from such a child , ruthlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what miraclesare . Violences aimed toward impossible good . Tears smart his eyes . " When was this ... second ceremony ? " The chador considers . " Three days past . . . four ? I  --  " " Had n't a calendar , yes . " Why 's he so angry ? " Why would Bakhtiary want it ? " " To help Manoucher . Everything  --  was for Manoucher . " From the dais , Fereydoun , seeing them talk , shrugs at them , nodding . He 's supporting Madame on his arm . " They all know then ? That it was only tape ? "  | " Madame  --  Fereydoun was to tell her . Just before . " No one 's helping Manoucher 's Soraya , still on the dais , eyes fixed on the empty video screen , hands dragging against her black . The chador , taking off its glasses , has dropped its veil . Offering her its face , if she wants it near . Manoucher 's wife 's not looking , or not accepting . " And Manoucher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Questions he does n't want to ask crowd his head .

And I am not  --  too much here yet . " Ask about her accent . Or run . " You were at school in Germany . Like Manouch ? " " Switzerland . Only Manoucher had to go to Germany . Like Madame . Then to England . Like Bakhtiary . It was the agreement . " And afterward to us . And now finally , back to Iran . Manoucher 's wife is standing up . In front of her , a train of women moves toward the next room , walking with the prinking body delays of the gauded-up . She walks starkly , but following . The girl from Ardebil 's baby will precede Manoucher 's and hers  --  if they ever have it  --  an infant aunt or uncle , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will precede the son 's . No wonder their men love flowers , bending brotherly over them , their own body-gardens budding so inter-generationally . Where 's Manoucher now ? Who told Fereydoun ? Why is Madame needing to be led away , that immobile dress of hers at last shaken to glitter ? This ersatz Swiss miss  --  he 'll bet it was Geneva where her tongue was trained to tick like a watch and her brain also  --  what was she doing in that bedroom , caught by the cameraman , not by accident , not that camera , at the aftermath door of a wedding already so afterthe-fact ? Who but Bakh could draw her there  --  this Soraya , this other one ? In the West , such a naming would be expected to have psychic effect , here it 's merely a family position , where every member is doweled in from all directions , down to the half-brother , half-sister variations , not all of it remnant polygamy even now , and still so multiform that not to marry too near within the blood takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man to marry a young girl is more than respectable , not necessarily to be frowned on because the girl happens to be the man 's wife 's blood-niece . If ' there are incestuous dreams attached to matching old with young  --  Wert can hear fakhtiary say , indeed hasp314a letter saying  --  then these are Western dreams . With us , Wert , such marriage is erotically just , and eugenically coveted . And  --  he did n't add  --  male . No business of the women . The room 's empty except for the two of them , and the blank video . It 's Bakh 's calendar , why confirm it ? Leave with your own riches . A last letter , a box suitably disposed of . That 's enough . And he himself can answer all of this . " Bakh 's dead , is n't he ? " Then he 's shaking her , this wrapped woman who was sent to him like a rose-tree . Carrying a box to break for him . The chador falls from her , the glasses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White bandages rise out of the wide neck of her dress , expertly overlapping like a mummy 's cerements . But they 've persuaded her to something . The dress is black . He kneels . " How can I  --  I 'm sorry . " " It 's only I heal . It draws together . " Her teeth are chattering . " You have fever . " " Not of the flesh . " From the chador 's folds a long silver-mesh pouch emerges . Like a sword , he thinks , a bumpy female sword , and with some of the same medieval necessity . She dumps its contents into her lap . He 's meant to study them . The pills are ordinary enough , the same compound the Embassy staff used to get at the PX pharmacy . Her hand brushes the bottle aside , the blunt , unpainted hand of any competent American girl , on it a signet ring . Under the bottle is an old iron key of the kind used to open their courtyard doors , a passport , a billfold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain . " My father 's . They let me keep it . " " I have trouble remembering . Imagining , I mean . That you were in prison . " Her eyes are brown , not that fanatic blue . " Because , yes  --  of your wife . May I have a little water ? " In the bathroom , that sponge-strewn spa gilded with luxe from Paris and Venice , the toothbrush glass is an old etched tumbler in a cheap metal holder , the kind one used to get in any teahouse , but important to someone here . The money 's been coming over here for years but now they 're bringing whatever they can to remember with ; even a Swiss bank account is not that restorative . His hand shakes , holding it . What she said was a shock , a shock , showing him not only what she knows but what she is . Bringing her the water , he ca n't help seeing it . He 's brought two other women water in similar circumstance , Jenny during her menstrual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's character in the way they take it . His mother was a dramatizer ;  |p315she  drank her death in sips , and made him watch . Jenny drank with self-impatient shame . This girl 's even shorter on self-pity . She wants the water . No upward thank-you glance as she drinks . He already knows her eyes are brown . He knows more about her than is fair  --  that back , those breasts . The mouse will be black . With the pill , color and girlhood return to her . Aunthood  --  or is it clanhood ?  --  fades . Would he always be able to tell the difference ? He doubts it . " Funny . When I need to be strong , I do n't shiver . Only afterward . Over here . And on the plane . " He picked up the bottle , looked inside . Only the aspirin compound the bottle said it was . " The customs inspector , he looks , too . I tell him  --  no , we do n't hashish , we do n't drink , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be friendly with you . Our flesh is clean . " Her teeth are indeed white . " But you still tremble . And do n't answer questions . " She 's putting the articles in her lap back into the pouch , one by one . Under its silver mesh the shape of each is still decipherable , a support of a kind . " I did not admire Hossein Bakhtiary 's letters to you . Yes , he is dead . " He turned his back . That video screen , what 's it made of ? Not linen . Nothing so mortal . " Of the disease ? " No answer from behind him . The screen too has no opinion . " They kill him after the ceremony ? " When she walked in there ? Then why would they let her go , afterward ? A light , shuffled movement behind him , the kind kids make in games ; you 're guessing close , Wert , you 're warm . Or she 's gone , stolen away . She must want to . He wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the stairs , looking down them . On the way she 's dropped the chador . That cha-cha black dress they 've given her is much too big for her . Even so , a girl like her might accept it to mourn the revolution in  --  a girl more comfortable behind bars . Where there are matters to stand up for . " You kill him ? " He 's surprised her . People judge his exterior incapable of such conceptions . " No ? He wanted to marry you , though , Fereydoun said . " " Once , yes . " " But you refused . " " No one would believe it . " " Why ? "  | " My father was already dead . In prison . We are the stupid ones of the family . " She 's fumbling in that purse of hers again , holding out a palm . The iron key is in it . " I have nothing . " There 's not a jewel on her except the signet ring ; he should have noticed that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousin , his great-grandmother 's ring had been hidden in advance of the Northern army first in the craw of a stuffed owl , then in a sack of spoiled barley , and as houses and barns went for burning , was several times swallowed by a faithful slave . Some people progress through history via their objects . He had hoped not to , if only by default . Envying these others , who travel so light . " Did Bakh  --  were you sent to prison because you refused ? " " I go to prison because of myself ! " She picked up the chador , smoothingit . " Soraya follows me . I am to blame . So then I ask them , to let her go . To come here  --  they will do it . " She tossed the chador on a chair . " So then  --  she ask for me . " Her face is a study . Fatalism ? Too modern a word for it . There 's a rogue smile to it . " But yes , when I am first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody . Fereydoun does n't tell you that . " He sees it . " Madame . " " Oh  --  Fateh , too . Those two are used to each other . But I ? For a third wife ? Even that girl is better . " On the other screen the bride remains , high above them , in suppliant curve . " So they found her  --  " the girl said . " Like you find a nurse . " Wert stared up at Bakh 's thickened mouth . Relieving to conduct this inquiry in his presence , even a token one . Ritual : the uses of . He 's learning . " He would n't have killed himself . Not for pain . Especially not . " " Not pain of the flesh , " the girl said . " No . Or not of his own flesh . " From the other room , the dining quarters , there 's silence now . " He wanted to feel it there in the throat , he said . A knife . Nothingelse would do , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not give him thatsatisfaction . But I agree  --  to watch . " So , the girl from Ardebil . Who will do for me , Wert , what I can no longer do for myself . She 's still up there in the photograph , curving toward nothing . " So . That 's when the camera caught you . When you came to watch . And  --  did she ? " " No . Because of the baby , she would n't . All these months what she does for him , you can imagine . She even lets him put the knife in herp317hand . But at the last minute , she would n't . Because of the son-to-be , she said . Hers . And she ran out . " " Leaving  --  you . " " He picked up the knife himself . He could still walk ; he is only so weak . The chair was for television ; they said the audience could see how much too weak . They are very criticizing . But to do what he wants he has to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tray of hieroglyphed sand is still at Bakh 's feet . Down here , the respondent tray has been cleared away . There 's such silence behind those swinging doors to the dining room ; somebody 's telling them . The physical  --  everything in the universe is anticipated there . Dare a man say that ? What then happens to him ? " And did you watch as he asked ? Damn you  --  did you watch ? " I did . He heard it through a veil , a red thunder in his ears , the knife cold against his own throat , then warm . He found himself kneeling , collar choking him , the slide projector in front of him . He wrenched at the switch . The screen went blank . A white blackout , all the invisible girls gone , or kneeling . She is n't . Her perfume sickens him , or is it her strength ! His throat hurts but is whole . " Roses  --  all the way . " A death erotic to the end ? A rosebed of mysteries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all their heavens of the physical ? Yet the pain which excused the old man to take himself off honorably was n't of the flesh  --  or not of his flesh . Then it must be the - clan 's . Such an act , done in the stench of suicide blood but presided over by a white flutter of family honor , was what we called primitive . Two months from now , the babe would be born again , polymorphous as life itself . That is what we call perverse . How the Koran resembled the Bible . Old testaments . Behold the fire and the wood , but where was the lamb , for a burnt offering ? . . . And they came to a place God had told him of , and Abraham built an altar and laid the wood in order , and bound his son . . . . And the place is a hospital garden in Isfahan , where three mullahs guard the offering . With the father still thinking  --  I 'll save him yet . . . . And the angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the lad , for I know thou fearest God , seeing thou has not withheld thy son , thine only son , from me . But the mullahs were not angels and had n't withheld their hand . The stories were not the same ; only the methods were . No ram appeared in the thicket , as substitute . And Bakh lost.  |p318It  could have happened right after the wedding just witnessed , and before the bedroom scene . The camera had simply omitted it . A camera has no obligation . But I 'm getting up from my knees with the answer in my mouth , as if I 'm still Christian . " By then , they 'd killed the son , had n't they ? " he said . " Manoucher . " She 's leaning forward and down the stairs , her black dress whipped against the banister , retching the name . One arm flails . " Manoucher . Manoucher . " How they mourn . He 's envious . Such a fountain of grief , in Farsi of a range he 'll never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better  --  he stretches his arms to circle her . Two men are coming up the stairs . One is Manoucher . Lumbering ox-eyed , he hunches past the girl to stand in front of Wert . It 's the coat that 's dead , torn at the breast , muddied with handprints , smeared with the orange turd dogs used to leave in the streets there , as if they ate turmeric . Even so it 's kept its shape . The man inside has n't . The coat 's pockets clink as he shifts ; there 's metal weighting them . He 's thin , but not enough to need such ballast . He has his arms and legs . Only the mustache is gone . Yet this body belongs to that coat . Manoucher 's cheek is laid against Wert 's , once , twice and rests there . Wert 's arms go round him as he heaves . This torn creature was never a boy . " Easy now . Easy . Told you I 'd get you here , " the other man on the stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could sit for Uncle Sam ; he looks up . " Hello , Wert . " Nosworthy has a tan , maybe from Jamaica , maybe from Ceylon . Sri Lanka . He leans on banisters round the world . " What  --  " Nosworthy holds up a warning hand . Manoucher 's standing in front of the girl , his right arm moving in a plane between his face and hers ; is he blind ? Wert ca n't see whether or not his pupils are moving . Grunting , Manoucher finds her cheek . He stands back from her , his pockets clanking . The slap makes her rock . A weighted dummy , returning upright the other cheek . Before the two men can act , he turns from her , breathing hard , a gone bull , the eyes red and small but seeing , and lumbers past them , threading the massed empty chairs with a nod here , there , as if to invisible occupants . At the door to the dining room he stops . " I bring them the keys . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He bows to Nosworthy . " You will  --  you will be thanked . " To Wert he says nothing . The door swings behind him.  |p319Cheeks  flaming , the girl 's fingering a tooth . She wards off both men . " He had to  --  " she says to Wert in Farsi . " Ah , poor  --  he never hit a woman before . " When he 's sure she 's all right he turns to Nosworthy . " What are you doing here ? " A departmental question . Who could ever really answer it ? " I was posted there , " Nosworthy says , still leaning . " Ahead of our new , new ambassador . He never got there . Seems we 're both persona non . On my way out , did a good deed on the way , that's. all . Poor bugger . " His long legs shift , tensing . Only symptom you could ever spot . " You do n't believe that  --  fully ? Try . " " He 's not blind . What 's wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather be . . . Excuse me . This lady  --  you 're Soraya , young Bakhtiary 's wife ? " " That 's why Manoucher hit me , " the girl says rapidly in Farsi . " Becausehe is head Bakhtiary now . And because I watched .... But this man , I wo n't speak with him . " " No , this is the other Soraya , " Wert said . It 's not possible to tell whether or not Nosy has heard of her . He deserves his rise though  --  if one can call it that  --  even if he does n't know Farsi . If one can be sure of anything about Wert 's sometime mentor . He 's a member of the Department . Leave it at that . " They offered him a choice , " Nosworthy said . " Blindness , or  --  it seems there are certain ritual  --  punishments . Though I 've my doubts on the validity of this one . Young Bakhtiary chose blindness . They simply did n't keep their promise . He should have known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to him ? " He 's afraid he already knows . " She is n't the wife , then ? " " No . " Nosworthy 's still uneasy . " We 're not sure it was the mullahs , you know . Might have been  --  extremists . " " We do n't have to know , you mean  --  " Wert said . " But I have  --  an interest . " " So I see , " Nosworthy said . " She speak English ? " The girl flicked an eyelid . " Maybe she 's taken a vow not to . " Nosworthy gets it . But what 's it to him if this girl in chador thinks he 's dirt ? Tax him with the one thing he ca n't take . " What they did to Manoucher , " Wert said . " Something you ca n't tell Gail , is it ? " Target . Now he 's lost a friend , if he ever had hire . No cop-out that way , though . One 's always responsible for what one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straighter , away from the banister . One has to admire . " I just do n't happen to , Bill . Tell her what I do n't yet understand myself . " His voice is gentle . Always was . Gentle hand , on Wert 's shoulder . " Remember in Manila  --  Chip 's time ? That day we were in his office together ? " The ambassador who believed in real talk . Remanded to an insignificantpost by a President who did n't . " Yes , I remember . " Nosworthy knew how we younger ones admired him . Uncle is pulling out all the stops . " And I recall the incident . " The ambassador had read out to the two of them a Manila newspaper account of a Filipino who 'd cut off the testicles of a man who 'd defloweredhis sister , and had thrown them into a public refuse can . The paper had reported the victim as attempting to retrieve them , then exclaiming , " Oh , what 's the use ? " Should n't laugh  --  the ambassador had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boys ? Just then an aide had come in , on the matter Wert and Nosworthy were there for . And the ambassador is dead now , and ca n't say . " But that brand of punishment normally fits the crime , does n't it , Uncle ? Does n't that bother you ? Gail would never understand how Manoucher 's helping out Uncle Sam could be a sexual offense . " " Watch yourself , Bill . " " Everybody 's watching  --  everybody . I 've a departmental interest in watching you and me face the violent facts . " " Do n't you go cosmic on me , Wert . " The girl spoke from behind them . " What 's she saying , Bill ? " Nosworthy waited . " You 'd better say . " " Oh , I do n't mind  --  interpreting . That was always my role , was n't it ? Even though I 'm not coming back to it . " The girl is speaking softly , ice water on his back . " She says . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business of the family ... like their cousin . . . Fereydoun . " Wert swallows . " That right now . Manoucher will be giving out the keys in there . . . . And that ... I am welcome . To . . . join them . " You only , the girl says . " Oh , those keys  --  " Nosy said , with compatriot chumminess . " He would n't be parted from them , even in hospital . The Jews did that , you know , when they left Spain in the umpteenth century . Took their household keys with them . Very good hospital by the way . Old Bakhtiarysaw to that . Saw to everything , did n't he , Bill ? Saw to you . " " That makes two of you . How much did you already know  --  or plan  --  in Washington , that lunch we had ? "  | " Did n't take much to see it . That sending you a woman was what they had in mind . Gail  --  " " Saw it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recruit Manoucher ? " " Told you in Washington then I liked the sound of him . When I got to Teheran , I  --  simply got in touch with him . " " You and Gail never got to Ceylon ? " " Sri Lanka . No . Fell through . We 're still persona non there . " As in Teheran , and other places . As even in Jamaica in your own garden , behind a steel hedge no orchids can hide . " I only took soundings , Bill . Give me credit  --  he never even came to the Embassy . " To your hotel ? Or a teahouse ? What would that matter , in a bazaarcityteeming with as many small-boy runners as there are articles of merchandise ? " And you used my name to put the screws on him . " Behind Wert , the girl says softly , " Manoucher would have gone anyway . On his own . As a Bakhtiary . You are not to blame . " Does Nosworthy really not know Farsi ? He 's staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am extremely sorry for him , you know . But you saw him slap her . None of them acts like us , Bill . When are you going to face up to it ? " " I am facing it , Nosy . " He sees him brighten at the old nickname . From the diningroom he hears the mourning noises cognate anywhere , then above the rest a child 's wail , loosed because the adults have given way . Does he also hear Fereydoun ? He turns to the girl , who nods . " Fereydoun heard of it first . " When she bows her head the bandage can be seen at her nape . " Come away with me , Bill . " " That what you came for ? " He knows it is . To the rescue . One of us is in danger of going cosmic . " You ca n't just leave us , you know . There are  --  " " Formalities . " And you 'll put the screws on me with them . The noise inside there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prayer . Smelling as prayer always did in that country , stuffy with food . " Bill . " Nosworthy 's too smart to come close . His long hands slide into his pockets , his pleasantly quizzical face , neatly bordered by its statesidecollar , cocks wryly . " What 's the use ? " The Farsi comes from behind Wert , iron in his back . " What 'd she say ? " So the man really does n't know Farsi . Or not much . " She said  --  ' Get rid of him . ' "  |p322How  light on the stairs a man as tall as Nosy can be , going up or down . Halfway , he pauses . Framed in the stairwell window 's harsh , poster glare , he looks more than ever like Uncle . " I feel responsible for you , Wert . " " Oh  --  I feel the same for you . " Wert did n't watch him go out . The years ahead would take care of it . He turned . " Soraya  --  ? " First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own way through the empty chairs . He followed her . At the dining room door he took her hand . " Afterwards  --  you 'll let me take you to my cousin 's ? " A formal proposal , which he thought she 'd understand as such and indeed , she bowed . They led each other inside . Once again these people themselves pull him back from sentiment . Behind a long refectory table around which men and boys are ranged three-deep , the walls are a backdrop of silver , descending shelf by crammed shelf , from heraldic urns and huge ewers to samovars and lamps , to plaques and plates and goblets , to bud vases singly furled . A sheeny white shallowness came from the intricately matted surface of all Iranian silver , whether from content or the overiridescence of the engraving . The women are sitting directly underneath , clasping children , even teenagers , to their knees . Because he 's never had children , he often looks at them as if they are people . Disaster 's occurred somewhereabove these small awed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; the oldest ones know their elders have horrors to keep . Keys lie all over the table . Manoucher , at its head , is distributing them , each time to an answeringmurmur , imprecation or prayer . He has taken off the coat . They seat Wert at the opposite end of the table , in the place saved . Ritual is in the room , good or bad ; each time Manoucher hands out a key and hears the response , normality shudders closer to him . The keys are all of the same shape . When the last one 's been dealt , Wert hears his own name . An object is passed down the table to him . " Hossein 's  --  " the man next to him , no one he knows , mutters as he lays it in front of Wert . Flat , gradated segments of fine yellow ivory , incised in small double circles , form a fish of about four and a half inches long . He 's seen those double circles before , on amulets against the evil eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wert 's eye is already mentally restringing it . Perhaps this is intended . The string itself is of the cheapestkind . One would n't twirl such an object , but in a pocket the abraded ivory might be subtle and comfortable to thumb . Carefully , he scoopedp323up the white fish , feeling its blind scales , and stowed it away . He has caught it , and been caught . Nobody says anything . Coffee , not tea , and powerfully sugared , is then whipped on the table by the women , with the same hushed but up-to-the-occasion air women anywhere assume in the sickroom , or after death . According to which women serve who he can begin to distinguish families , though there are enough of the tiny silver-framed cups for everyone . They must have known all these five weeks that Manoucher was in danger , just as they had carried with them the more ordinary family portent of a patriarch 's death . Bakh , gambling for his son , had even then entwined his gesture with his own roseate greed for life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of violence as they repress their knowledge of death . Even these people ? Or , scarcely knowing it , had they here made their first real entry into the new life ? The new  --  ritual . Only Manoucher perhaps had repressed nothing . The night he and Wert had dined at the Garrick he must have known what scrutiny might well be lying in wait for him in Iran , after the five years in New York . But he was the son . Across the room , the two Sorayas are once more together . Manoucher'swife , recognizable only by her height and the way she clasps herself , is now in chador , a familiar one . They have exchanged . The other Soraya , in the borrowed black she has no temperament for , and bareheaded , is making no outer attempt to comfort her . There 's no need . They are complements . Manoucher 's coming toward him , carrying his cup : Must anything more be said , commemorative ? Uber alien Gipfeln  --  ist Ruh ? Wert 's never been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goethe . Probably these days many people feel the same about us . But death at least is always translatable . Say nothing . Another kind of effort is being made . The petal-shaped cup shakes in Manoucher 's palm . He drinks . " Some of these people have now no houses , Beel . In the past they have paid big house-deposit money here , which the agents will now not give back . But now these people get no more money from home . We have lawyers , but need perhaps a special one . You have names ? " Manoucher 's sweat-beaded upper lip , seen without its mustache , is as long as his father 's . In boyhoodhe retrieved a motorcycle , kept all these years in a garden in Teheran . Whose wall now has no key . Or perhaps there 's no longer a wall . But business will he clone.  | " I 'll  --  see that you get one . In Washington . " " New York is better . We will all be here . " In a body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they do . " You 'll be in London , Beel ? " " Not for long . Manoucher  --  I must speak to you personally : " As if from the first we have n't . " I must tell you something . " Which you already know or suspect . This being what ritual is . " You 're the head of the family now . " No harm mentioning it . " I want your permission to take the other Soraya to meet my cousin . She agrees . " Now that Manoucher is thin , pit his smooth face as if from smallpox and you would get old Bakhtiary 's lineaments . No miracle . This is what happens between dead fathers and live sons . The minute Wert 's father was dead people began to remark how he resembled him . Manoucher set down his cup . " Rightfully , we should both speak to my mother . But she is  --  resting . She does n't wish  --  to see me . " His face is impassive . Gray is draining into it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She goes tomorrow to Switzerland . Soraya , my wife , goes with her . " He 's looking over at his wife , at the wrapped woman she has now become . " A lot of our money is there . They will . . . see to it . " But money , the restorative , the bracer , is n't helping . He sways . Wert rushed to the sideboard , to a silver decanter which indeed did hold whisky . " Here . None of us has et . " In emergencies he became British now . As in sex , he became Southern again . The she-barrister had noted it . " Or perhaps you do n't drink alcohol . I forgot . " But Manoucher has already downed it . He sits with glass in hand . Over on the women 's side , Fateh 's two tarted-up daughters are kneeling in front of the two Sorayas chattering excitedly ; news of the departure has spread . Of the two departures . Two and two ; things are symmetrical here . Clans are . Ankhs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time by powder puff . The two gigglers , lips pursed , are lightly wielding long-handled ones over the other Soraya 's still face . Now they 're at the eyelashes with a brush , now intently at her lips , . dipping each time into a tray between them piled bright with gilt jars , tiger-striped boxes and a suede roll of instruments . Life goes by tray here , and by whatever hieroglyph . The other Soraya sees he 's watching her . Under a last brush of powder , she sneezes . Perfume wafts toward the two men . " I had whisky first in London , " Manoucher says , staring . Fateh 's girls , deserting the finished Soraya , begin coaxing Manoucher 's wife from her veil.  | " At the Dorchester , I had it , " Manoucher said , turning his back on them . Children are drifting past , boys chasing girls , small toddling after big . " About London  --  " Wert says , " I 'll be leaving now anyway . " Manoucher 's head hangs . His profile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand on his shoulder . " Remember at the Garrick , eh ? That cabby you hired ? Soaking in oil you all were , he said . " It gets a smile . Manouch puts a hand on Wert 's hand . They stay so , clasped . After a bit , Manoucher takes a deep breath . " We were never in oil . " " I know . " " My father thought it always too  --  too " Impermanent . " " A bubble , " Manoucher says in Farsi . He releases Wert 's hand . " But , Beel , must you resign ? " " Better so . I 'll find something over here . " " Ah  --  New York . Perhaps the UN ? " " That haven for leftover diplomats ? Sorry . " " Of which I am one . " A pause . Manoucher 's head comes up . " But yet with some  --  clout . " The usage is intended . It 's Bakh 's . " No ! " Wert said violently . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's forgotten the room of people . Their alerted faces are frightened , tender , vulnerable , proud , pleased . These two headmen have made a conspiratorial nest  --  and it 's working . " Ah , Beel  --  what a too young country you are . " In Farsi , Manoucher soeunds even fatherly . " Marvelous . In politics , how you still stop to blame . " But the contempt seeps through . " It 's a waste in anything . But most in politics . " Wert bursts out hysterically laughing . People smile . The West always cheers . Manoucher nods back at them with dignity . " Besides "  --  he whispers in English  --  " that Uncle of yours . That baby papa ? How could you think it ? That it was him . " Wert 's shaking . Not much , nothing heroic . Just chicken-sick , that chile , the old home kitchen help say in his head . " Industry , yes  --  Much better to be there now , than in government . " Suddenly Manoucher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The boy stands shyly , squirming in his jacket and tie , the skin like dark dew , the eyes pure , the lips full with hope . He 's the hope of the world , Wert thinks  --  I never noticed it . Manouch cuffs the boy 's cheek . " Get Mr. Ordoobadi . " The kid rushes off ' , blushing like a page . Ordoobadi turns out to be the man who knows about banks andp326Wert 's relative in Baton Rouge . He also knows the name of the lawyer Wert might best procure for them . He speaks a fast-blending patois of Farsi and English . The idiosyncracies of almost any major American city 's country clubs are at his polished fingertips , and like the clubs , suffering from a certain industrial pollution . He 's been everywhere in the service of the Bakhtiary interests , from Beverly Hills , where they do n't scorn to be backers of a boutique which dresses the stars , " A whirlywind success ! " to Huntsville , Alabama  --  " You know NASA ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is Wert up on what Bakh these last years was into ? " Space , I believe . Outer space . " The obverse of inner space ? Wert 's never thought of it that way before , but in this man 's orbit it does obtrude . " I like best Texas , though . Fine red people . Fine hearts . And in New York , of course , the Kinkerbocker Club . You belong ? " Hungry , light-headed , sick at heart  --  though that 's curiously fading , or blending with what may be sexual hope ; we wo n't call it love yet  --  he 'll believe even Mr. Ordoobadi at the Knickerbocker Club . " No , I 'm a Southerner . Georgia . " " Ahhh . They are more honey-butter there . " Ordoobadi sparkles with what he knows well enough is his " line "  --  the more telling because he believes it . He 's divided the people of this country by color , which is after all how it began . Florida girls tend to be fish-belly white . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor  --  and hopes we 're in control there . Thinks we are . " Also in Bridgeport . Very pale . " Washington ? " Ah  --  a girl rainbow . But not only from yours . " " You 're a poet . " And under the gloss , one of my old cronies , to the life . Ordoobadi takes the compliment as due ; all men of his race are . But at the moment real estate preoccupies him . Children are running everywhere with bowls of nuts and finger food ; the intensive predinner nibbling has at last begun ; the two old servants are circling . He waves a comprehensive hand , accepting a soft drink from one of them . Pity  --  but soon they must move from this neighborhood . " Too much brown . " Not blacks , no , and not Puerto Ricans . He does n't actually know what they are . He snaps a finger . A tall , good-looking boy appears . " My son . At Deerfield Academy . Mohammed , what are the people in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Doctors , nurses , orderlies , hospital staff mostly  --  from the nearby ones . Dentists . " The boy shrugs . " Airline stewardesses , personnel . They team up . "  | " No , you know what I mean . What are they ? " Ordoobadi turns to Wert . " Twenty years ago , they begin coming here , I am told . From when your people leave their country . " The boy 's faintly smiling . " He means the Philippines . " He 's not being insolent . He 's merely been born too late to know Bakh 's generation and into circumstances which have made him wiser than his father . But two to one , he 's no longer the hope of the world . " Couple of them were at our school . " His father dismisses him . " Not like these . " " No . I 've been in the Philippines . " Twenty years ago , that slowmovingsquatter-crowd behind the Embassy  --  could some of those here  --  be some of them ? This small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the sons of the sugar land-holders , I fancy . " In the Manila opera house , their wives wore spun-sugar dresses , jenny had joked . " Or of diplomats . " A servant is at Wert 's elbow , decanter in hand . They 've noted him already . He pours himself one . " Whisky , Ordoobadi ? " " Eh  --  no thanks . " He bows . " I have though many men in my busyiness , who drink it . " " I 'm sure . " Representative Americans . Who , like anyone who joins a clan , will never quite make it to the top  --  even if not brown . From the grave , a voice he 's incontinently glad to hear . Now , Beet . Never think we 're as stuck in our skins as you are . When among you , we 're not observing our prejudices , but your statuses . Safest for us to be at the top . So the voice will go on . That 's something . " You ever think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The card extended has Ordoobadi 's name , four intercontinental offices and a cable line , but no company name . " Sell space , eh ? Just pure white space . " " Eh ? " Wert repeats it in Farsi . " What good Farsi ! " " Honey-butter style . " But Ordoobadi is jubilant . " Listen to this , Manoucher ! What do you think we sell ? We sell  --  " Manoucher is gone . On the women 's side , those two doll-babies , bending over from their four-inch heels with their round bottoms reared , have persuaded his wife from her veil . iler revealed face , rigid as a mask on a neck not itsp328own , is untintable . Clearly even those two do n't dare . All by herself she has a symmetry , of lap and knee , lax hands on them , of black brows dabbed . The blue eyes swim , blinking . There 's a Bellini in the National Gallery looks like that , but it has an infant on its lap . On impulse he walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She must know the effect they have on him . He 's just identified it . When he kisses her hand , Fateh 's girls breathe in as one . Or does the whole room already know what he 's just found out ? That he 's been sent the wrong girl ? Had she herself known at once ? That they should have sent her to him ? Poor blue-eyed , bluestocking Machine , with a neck made to arch more under kisses than under doctrine , she does remind him of Jenny , but only because he recognizes that blend of the steadfast and the mercurial  --  and knows just how far it will go . Of all the people here , she 'd have made it quickest to being an American . He lets go her hand . In Switzerland , life under Madame 's vengeance will assuage her guilt ; it 'll be like being in prison again . But after that , a girl like her must verge toward convicted action . Or toward a man , possibly a family one . Or will she become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charioteering Dianas in the new high-philosophical , female business style ? Before that , he and the other Soraya must send for her . Hope is what she needs . " Speak English , " he says to her . " Oh , not to me . But generally . Break a vow , why do n't you ? Maybe it 'll help . " Cruel . He 's learning . " And I 'll write you , from America . Letters you might even like . " He sees that the other Soraya has vanished . A sharp-eyed chorus in duo at his elbow supplies the answer before he asks . " She is waiting outside . " " We are ready to eat , she does not want to . " " She will help drive ; she has international license . " " They have pack you a lunch . " " A very good lunch . " " Good-bye . " " Good-bye . " What practical girls they are , and she is . Prettier than Manoucher 's wife , the other Soraya is also easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brave , she 'll have his admiring tenderness forever . Plenty steadfast , too , she sees beyond ideals alone . She is the true heroine . Pink socks . Manoucher 's wife would have been  --  will be  --  neurotic enough to fight with him , sardonically knowing what is wrong with him . Livingp329with him , or near , she 'd wage war against the West in him  --  and so assuage his guilt . Wert wants both of them  --  in the house . He understands that concept perfectly , wanting at once to talk over this marvel , and his devious progress to it , with the person who would understand each  --  perfectly . Who would agree that in both these solemnly breathtaking girls there are certain flecks of humor  --  discernible in each like the flakes in a glass of Goldwasser , which could flourish best in concert  --  which must be what harem humor is . Who would concede that for the time to come , or maybe for all time , the girl waiting outside for him is now Soraya , Manoucher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Bakh has done for him , considering the modern world . And Wert is going to accept . Knowing every nuance of the climb by which he 's come to it  --  every horizontal traverse , crampon and pickax by which two mountaineers can climb from opposite sides to the top  --  new snow on old ice being specially dangerous . Which top turns out to be a flat space just big enough for two pairs of boots , one of them worn down at the back . Does such a space have any credit in the realms of higher conflict ?  --  Probably not . Some human weaknesses are too small for international congresses . ... Oh do n't be too sure about that , Wert . As I 've hinted before  --  there 's an underskin sexual thrill to the changeovers of nations , whether these come by codicil or a landing onshore . Take the spinster British  --  shrouding supple India in her own muslins and pongees . Or the French with their ferocious dictionaries , seducing Algiers from behind a coy fretwork of civil law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll rape it yet . With our barbarian wedge . But now they want him out of here , the whole crowd . Those men he 's met are surrounding him , fiercely suave . He 's theirs now . Those he has n't met are smiling allegiances , crude or austere . But like any in-laws they have family secrets to mull over , feelings still to be kept from him . The wedding is over , of him to them . " Good-bye . " " Good-bye . " This dark rug-room , spored with their moisture and light , is already growing them a world here , which can go anywhere . They 'll penetrate the contradictory life over here  --  our bathrooms like hardened blancmange , our pavements dirtied with garbage gone beyond collection ,  |p330the  fat land gone nitrate-rich with wells our farmers themselves dare n't drink from  --  yet all of it still gassed only with domestic stainings , for generations not browned with mass blood . Into it they 'll insert themselves , arrowheads steelier than are known here , but bazaar people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the local words for what with them will end up in the clan machine , and in the gems wound like electric lace around the women . Where we bar them from our inns , they 'll buy them . Their keys will grow here as these always grow , iron affecting the host soil . It 's nothing new . In London , all the stationers are Pakistani now ; in New York , Korean all the fruiterers . Such a movement comes from below the money-mark as well , a lowly surf no United Nations dare legislate aloud , no bourse will bother with . The Bible and Koran are full of it . No diplomacy can hold out against it , it 's the paranoia of what happens . Nations move . How very tiring it has been , though , not to admit that ever-third world to consciousness . " Good-bye . " " Oh , good-bye , Ordoobadi . " Ordoobadi 's hand makes a feint at being firm , then lies limp in Wert 's . But it 's merely the bisexual handshake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it 's the new opium , Misser Wert . You think about it . " Wert tiptoes from the room , closing its door behind him . Crossing the empty second room of chairs and screens , he closes that door as well , with caretaker heed . So , Smiley  --  my village . See you at the KinkerbockerClub . On the landing she 's waiting patiently ; a girl without a calendar . Otherwise , that girl has vanished . Or all versions of her yet seen . Brown coat now , brown cap , shoes to match  --  and stockings , soft plop of brown bag . The going-away clothes , who has n't contributed them ? Jewels in her ears . Collar up , one ca n't see the bandages . She 'll do for him what he 's never been able to do himself . She 'll heal , but not too easily . She 'll keep a sharp lookout . But she 's not alone . Fereydoun 's valise is at his feet . His hat is on his valise . " You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let her go alone . " " Ca n't they . Or only to prison ? " She 's already sneaking her glasses on , as if they 're contraband . " And your cousin . That charming lady . Would she approve ? " " My cousin has more than charm . " " I recall . " Fereydoun squats to his hat . Smoothing it , he looks like ap331butler stirring a campfire . What bruised-blue bits of human offal , human history , he must grill there from time to time , some of it his own . There 's a Tory glow about the old man , a stubbornness like the light seen through the stained-glass of badly reconstructed saints . What is it ? " Madame  --  wishes me gone . It was never my house . " Why , he 's honest , that 's all . But with such a struggle to show it , under that equivocal voice , plumped countenance . Could one learn to divine it ? " And Manoucher  --  wishes not to look at me . " How easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cousin is already half in the room , consoling with all her native good : Oh , but , Mr. Fereydoun , your knees are still so good , for our age . She , not Wert , could become Ferey 's confidant , more hardened in the hands than Madame but as welcomely imperious . On her antebellumporch in old Athens  --  with their backs to the gas station  --  she and he can exchange old civil wars . She learning , for instance , how long before this Sunday in Queens Fereydoun had had to be the silent harborerof bad news . Hearing , too , what Wert only now surmises . Up to now he had visualized the old courtier ever behind a screenwork of telephone calls . Now , looking at the old man and the girl , he grasps the collusive innocence which has had to be meted out between them . She had carried the news . Wert looks over at the girl . " In that case  --  ? " A brown chirrup from her . " Okeh . " She 's gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luminal , half pleasurable . " Well then , Ferey -- -I expect my cousin 'll be proud to have you . She liked you very much . " Fereydoun 's already standing , fingertips together . His own story will remain inviolate , except for a tremor of it that Wert can guess at : And I , Fereydoun , will not have to bear the sight of Manoucher . " Thank you , " he says low . " Your car 's a rented one , is n't it ? Why do n't we go in mine ? It is mine . " He blushes again . " Give me the registration . Fateh will take care of delivering it . " " She drives ? " " Like the wind . " He goes off to take care of it . " He 'll have some money of his own , " the girl says . " He does n't know it yet . Bakhtiary saw to it . Your cousin will take him in ? " " For good ? You 'd want that ? " " Best for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat . " Possibly she 'll be glad to . They 're about the same age . And tastes . " Crazy . How can he know what Ferey 's tastes are , or even his owncousin 's , ( luring those intervals when all creatures are a lone unit ofp332being ? He 's merely tired of clocking the differences between people ; he wants likenesses . It 's then we can make decisions for others . " And , that house of hers . " With all its assembled family garniture . " He can organize it . Like a palace . " Relieving me of that yoke . Wert finds he can smile . " Look  --  it wo n't take long to get to my hotel . They 'll find rooms , for you and him . The manager 's  --  a gentleman . Tomorrow you 'll see a doctor . " He 's prepared to insist . No answer . " At my cousin 's  --  we 'll decide what next . That okay with you ? " She has a right to know what to expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to him . To a sound he ca n't identify , either what it is or where it 's coming from , except that it 's not coming from the dining room . Pillahil-ilah-allah-ilal . The voice of the wedding presents , wailing from the box-room downstairs ? Or all the random birdcallsof his life come to plague him , as men are plagued when they find pleasures too strange for them ? **25;10231;TOOLONG . Balooch . No , it 's the call to evening , from the mosque . Do they have an imam , here ? Together , they follow it . In the small room off the hallway a slim figure , white-shirted , is touching its forehead to the floor over and over . It 's a young man , a young man 's voice , rasping and uncertain , new to heavenward allegation , testing it . Or greeting what presently exists . It 's the Ordoobadi boy . Finished , he passes their niche without seeing them . Wert has a view of his face . That face knows it is immigrant . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cronies for tea . This girl is bringing him dowry enough . The reasons for violence  --  he must always have wanted them . Wert raises his head , sniffing . He knows that smell , long-grained in the nostril , Caspian , on the edge of char . They 'll eat it anyway , as they always do . This meal is not on camera . Each child shall have a piece of its burnt lace . " The rice is burning . " That driver 's cap she 's wearing must be Fateh 's . The long visor projectsfrom her forehead like an antenna , over goggles that watch . He lifts the cap off , the glasses also , half wanting the guises never to end . She 's to lead him to the wilderness . Underneath , her eyelids are wrinkled shut in prune misery . Her mouth is moving , in his language . He bends his ear to it . " Make me be here . I am not here yet . Please  --  make me be here . " Ferey , passing them on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They seem to be in a passage of love.  |p333The  small room Wert can see over her shoulder has nothing religious in it except an east window . It 's reddening . Old Sol 's going cosmic , once again . In the mean street down below , buildings hulk on their paws before him . South of Vancouver , on the last coast West , mountains slope to the sea , kitten in the starlight . Praise all the path between there and here  --  his country . The game is always to enumerate , to praise , swallowing all ethical or aesthetic disappointment . To traipse across the steppes , the kraals , the wadis of whatever , the golf courses and the health stations of the new , new world , or the old , with heart-warming dinners everywhere . He ca n't . No more palaces , except for Fereydoun . How give someone your country except by first in faith receiving it , taking it like communion on the tongue ? In all its shames and glories . He pressed a hard palm against her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , " he said . We 're the western approaches , limpid in the starlight . They have n't really seen us yet.  | " OH MY HOMES  --  " Mulenberg writes to his daughters . The word processor has already corrected him  --  " honeys . " After spending three of his daily Free Room hours in mute session with it , he is n't about to argue . Those are his first written words . Behind him , Gilpin hunches in one of the silvery Easy Chairs , so labeled by its distant manufacturer . An easy chair should n't be luminous , he said the first day . He always has a book . Sometimes he annotatesrapidly in what he says is a form of speed-writing but each day he politely refuses use of the processor . " Bravo , " he says now . " Do n't stop for me . " " I 'm not . If you 're sure you do n't want it . " " Hath too lean and hungry a look for me . We wo n't have them at The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives its usual gaunt twitch . " Shakespeare  --  " the man now known to them as Cohen-Lievering says , making it out the airlock in one eel-hipped slide . His large head , bobbing on its rubber neck , recedes last . " Some exit line , " Mulenberg says . " He once had to recite whole plays , for his stuttering . " Gilpin nods toward the shelves of personal-history folders which line the forward wall . " Moves like an angel , though . " " Or like a bat . Extra-sensory vibrations in his nose . Where 'd he go ? " Mulenberg has no further reason to be envious of Lievering on Veronica 's account , unless one is stupid enough to be envious of history . The man to be jealous of , for commanding love he has n't sought , is sitting across from him . " Second crew 's ' cabin , next to the cockpit . He and Mole . " Gilpin 's facep338lights up . " That 's where they 've berthed the boy . The whistlers ' cabin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mascot , eh ? " " You might say  --  everybody 's . " Gilpin hunches further into the offending chair . He and Mulenberg are both in their more comfortable fatigue suits . He looks up from his usual brooding , the space pencil on its wrist-clip dangling idly . There 's gravity here , but no loose objects are allowed . " According to Mole , Ship 's Commander Captain Dove thinks Lievering looks like Jesus . A Jewish Jesus , the captain said . " Gilpin grins until the joke takes . " Mole  --  " Mulenberg says . " That the boy 's name ? Or his situation . " He 's not been too dazed by his own affairs to see that there is one . " He was born to it . " Gilpin shuts his lip . The man ca n't lie ; he even dislikes chairs for pretending to be Easy . But he can be sloppy about the facts . " Dove is n't the ship 's commander , " Mulenberg says gently . " Commander 's an air-force cross-over none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if even Wert has . Keeping him under wraps . " Gilpin smiles at himself  --  the kind of man who would see his own drawbacks in perspective . " Should 've known they 'd never stand for a commander named Dove . " So even Gilpin is n't idealist enough to assume there are no military aspects to this mission ? " The Civilian Courier , " Mulenberg says with a smile . Their brand of hype . So simple it works . For the great mass of the simple . For whom he has no contempt but no special feel , either . Except for his travels , he might have been one of them . " Wert says that word acts on me like a glass of wine . Civilian . " " Wert does n't get to go forward much , does he . For a man who 's going to be administrative officer . " Some show of equality was usually made by the military , when they wanted a man 's services . There had been  --  for Mulenberg . " Wert has  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pretty dated , eh ? " The answer is just a headshake , but with more cussedness than maybe shows . Anyway , a man not to be lifted up by his own lapels . Yet accessible . Gilpin may make it his business to know about you , but this is why you can talk to him . Mulenberg sighs . " Wert had daughters , he 'd know how dated he really is . Especially if they 've got the idea you travel light . " Veronica crosses his mind , like a wraith which ca n't get away this time . Where is she ? Not far . " Promised to write them a full account . Sop339as not to be just a  --  you know . Passenger freight . Maidie 's the emotional one , though to see her you 'd never know . Married to that town she lives in . Keeps their home on firehouse discipline . " Though that broker husbandof hers will never find the brass pole to slide down on for getaway . " I did something to shock her years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might as well know . I tore the dress  --  from the body . She had n't spoken to me since . Until the corridor . " Mulenberg stretched , staring up . Ceiling and walls here are some stuff the lay trade has n't got the patents to yet . " So this trip must be of some use . " Mulenberg 's chuckle does n't quite make it . He presses a wall slot , closes on the dropped lozenge and pops it in his mouth . " Tessa 's the kind one . The Californian . Lives in a Mendocino ravine , runs a commune . " He grins . " No one person 's supposed to run a commune . But Tessa does . With a lovely boy , now and then . Big girl , like her sister . Like me . Both of them with minds like their mother , sort I can talk business to . Miss that . Matter of fact , their college yearbook called them the two Kwan-Yins . " Though Tessa is n't that neat a dresser , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would horrify Maidie with price-guilt . But now , after years of drouth , he must find a present for Maidie , too . What can it be , from here ? " As for that lad  --  I like his spirit . Though that age , I never know what to say to them . " He chuckles . The lozenge has helped . Everything here works as it 's meant to . " Know what he said to Ver  --  Miss Oliphant ? I feel at home with you because you 're like me . By now you 're just a little bit black . ' " " Smart boy . " " Where is she ? " After that scene in the corridor he knows his offhandednessfools no one . " She has to wander . Reporter habit . " Gilpin smiles  --  since who can wander here ? " My guess is she 's in with Seat Six . " In the Hygiene Unit , one side of which has become the two women 's hangout . He smiles too for that female bonding . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's glad when Gilpin laughs . Watch myself , eh . Lived too long in Islam . " " Ah . You meet Wert there ? " " I recommended him . But d' ya know , I ca n't remember . Whether I actually did meet him . " " He blends . It worries him . " Mulenberg shuffles his notes , gathered for him in Washington . " Well , better get on with it . " Ile turned back to the machine . " You know  --  " he said dreamily , " I 've been going on the idea , tell the emotional stuffp340to Maidie , the practical stuff to Tess . Divided like they always were , or trying to be . But maybe that 's what 's holding me up . " " Lucky  --  " comes from Gilpin behind him , " That you can tell the difference . " There speaks a man who 's settled all that , Mulenberg thinks . Is it because I have n't yet , that I divide the girls ? Gilpin would never humiliatea corpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thrall to any of it ? He 's so safely in thrall to the multitude . " I 've read you , " Mulenberg said . Behind him , Gilpin writes : " How vulnerable they often are , the men with daughters only . Sometimes they have extra stature because of it , sensitivities they themselves do n't identify . Their loves are often marked by being so much with women  --  surely this man 's are . But the world can make them feel they 're men without sons , so sometimes they hunt the male life ? Bonding with the expense-account bars , the academicor commercial offices . And when they meet the lads '  --  other men 's sons  --  are shy with them  --  " " But , too easy for me to see what children are to people , since I have none . Like Wert here , up to now . " Otherwise , Wert 's life is so outrun by the past decade that to men like Mulenberg it must read like history . Nothing so outmoded one political framework as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is getting to be the last of a certain kind of national , a man whose responses , geared to Earth politics , are of a kind which , along with the twentieth century , begins to disappear . Decades go faster toward the end of a century . The old politics is now as primitive-sounding as old land-grants . The new century is in the air . So far according to what he 's reading , Wert has no children . But unlike Gilpin , he 's thought of it . Quickly , Gilpin buries his head . Not before he sees Mulenberg 's newestopener , transcribed on the lighted screen where the processor 's user and any audience may follow his thoughts , reblinked : Dear Kwan-Pins : Mulenberg 's going to cheat . His file of space data , executed by researchstaff at his various offices , is merely a dictionary of heterogeneous fact designed to help him self-orient . He 'll use it whether he understandsit or not  --  as really the more honest reportage on his present condition . And in spite of that salutation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him to do . As it comes to him ! He trembles with communication , holding that abused word in his mouth like a lozenge . I le 's nakedp341in this new limbo , with his two communicants . None of the three of them yet a corpse . Girls :  --  I 'm in a kind of common room and library which we 've taken to calling the Free Room , because we 're on our own here  --  not otherwiseprogrammed  --  and it has gravity . Pseudo of course , made by revolving the room , which is a cylinder , just as will be done in portionsof the habitat . Or so I get it . You understand I hope that we 're not en route to another planet . Excuse if I insult your intelligence . I find that notion still prevalent down below . We 're of course en route to a man-made station , only one larger and farther than ever before . And for longer inhabitance .

So thatHe pauses to look behind him , as he 'd done when he mentioned their philosopher . In sarcasm . Yet it 's a comfort to have that man near . Turningback to the keyboard , Tessa 's last blithe postcard comes to mind : Daddy , I have something to share with you .

Strictly , there are no mornings here .

But this he would rather not reveal . They will think it is him.  --  Once at the landing station , we 'll set our own day lengthsWhat 's he saying ? On a mainly industrial station already manufacturingcrystals to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must long since have been set . Why should he be defensive about that or about any of it ? For it now occurs to him that he is.  --  But we maintain . Since we must wear our full life-support suits at all times in the cabin or at drill , the bath hour is welcome . Everythingunisex , including a modified Jacuzzi . Privacy , though , can be calculatedScrounged , rather . The two women have more or less been allowed to be alone . Or so it 's working out . Over and above the scheduled life  --  in this one-way mousehole , as his big body sometimes inveighs at him  --  there 's always that other overlay . Of things working out.  --  For circulation 's sake , we 're expected to use the massage aids , alone or mutuallySo far as he knows , nobody 's been mutual , in Cabin Six.  --  All our activities are closed-circuit monitored , the video-auditor being the computer only , of courseOf course . But why think otherwise ?  --  We 're then left to various drills which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sick Bay , the said Galley and Hygiene Units . As well as our sector 's access to the Payload Bay  --  your daddy 's special interest , heh , heh  --  and to the forward and aft Avionic Bays , which includeHere he has to refer to his notes , which thank God and staff are as organized as a president 's should be , for a minute returning him in delicious pain to what it had been to be one.  |  --  radar altometers , general purpose computers , mass memories , rendezvous sensor electronics , microwave scan beam landing system , accelerometers and one-way Doppler extractor  --  all of those forward . Also rate gyros , aeroservice servo-amplifier units , all of these aft except the **25;10258;TOOLONG units , which are located in both . The names are by and large self-explanatory , except for that last one , whose function I confess I have n't yet learned . What a Doppler reactionis I have n't time for here , but any aerodynamics manual will explainPure bluff , Mulenberg , as they 'll know . Somehow that cheers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't up here yet . That scares him.  --  What we do not see are the passengers other than our own six , each cabin and service area being separate because of atmosphere maintenance . The Free Room has artificial sea-level atmosphere . We go in and out like at a bridge game . In fact , all our alternating arrangementsare a damn beautiful cooperative game . Or ballet . Maidie , you 'll know about thatIn which in the absence of any ballet master , the strangeness of what we do sometimes washes over us . Yet once , when by chance he was the one to dip out of a bay in order to allow Veronica entry  --  she lifting herself on the handrails with a face clearly ready for glory  --  he 'd caught a sense of what they were here for . He 'll have to mention Veronica soon.  --  Otherwise , except for no stewardesses  --  skyroom too precious  --  we 're like guests at a dull resort managed by the aeroequivalent of the Cornell School of Hotel Administration . Have n't seen the other guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise us both . That is  --  though we ca n't see each other all at once , or in sections , like in a jumbo jet , one hundred strong sipping from paper cups  --  an open-circuit viewing of all of us by all of us is on the prospectus . For the third week  --  no specified day . Most of our calendar is set . I understandthere 's already an events-calendar for two of your years ahead , on habitat  --   |p344The  flow of ordnance requires it . But that three-week turnaround visit to and from earth of the Courier , in time will it come to seem like the visit of the cruise ship to the remote port  --  everybody down to the dock ? Morale activities are to be planned  --  even Earth sells its opera tickets well ahead . But behind these happy exertions , all the equilibrationsof an artificial sphere will have to be kept going . In his New York office , one entire wall-mapped room monitors company operations which span the globe . But no care had to be taken to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitant will spend some portion of time at that . Appointed time . As here . Where then do the rumors come from ?  --  As for the sights , dear girls , we 're promised EVA . Not any rival of yours . Extra-Vehicular Activity . Planned EVA , they call it , or UnplannedEVA . Until I see it I ca n't say for sure , but I think of it as crewmen dancing on the surface of the shipMaybe to pat and inspect that ceramic skin whose spotty resistance to the terrible heat of reentry is always being " confirmed . " An uneasy word , industrially . Did that heat obtain not only at the moment of rendezvous between Courier and Earth as it reenters atmosphere from orbit , but also between Courier and habitat  --  as the Courier " docks " ? He 's never given it any thought . His notes do n't say . But the diagrammedOrbiter , slate-blue on cloud and annotated like a psalm , made the blood surge . Though if he 's still talking more or less to Maidie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes in for , which he secretly finds jaunty . Planes are asexual , so far as a passenger is aware . But though an Orbiter , with maybe a nod to the plants , carries its propellants in " pods " and has all the old " wing " and " tail " analogies to the birds , it " mates " with its own booster rockets , has " umbilicals " on the fuselage and aspires at all times to the " rendezvous . " The bell rang , signaling the first third of the time here . Mulenberg turned around . Gilpin gives him a " hard at work , too ? " smile . Mulenberg smiles back . No  --  I ca n't separate Maidie . They 've always complained we did n't separate them enough . Their mother used to call them " Messa-Taidie . " Calling them in from play . He smells the leafsmokeof long ago autumn dusks , sharper than any oxygenation within these NOLEX-felted portholes  --  and hears how he must sound to Gilpin . " I 'm an obsessive . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dreamers . According to a psychological study done for our personnel department , the best of us do n't even dream in money . Worse than artists , my doctor says . With even less to go on . " " You businessmen brought us here . " Polite man , if overcompassionate . Mulenberg wonders if Gilpin knows how literally that might be the case . Early on , the " international space effort " for the original long-term gravity-free environment had been mostly an affair of European prime and co-contractors , though he 'd worked with them all in a way  --  Fokker Netherlands on the optical windows and scientific airlock , Alitalia and Micro for module and thermalcontrol , SABCA Belgium for the film vault , INTA Spain and TERMA Denmark and FOKKER Germany for the management system integration and testing . Mulenberg 's company had had paper in all of them . As well as actually collaborating with the United Kingdom on a large instrument pallet-structure which could be controlled from withoutin some configurations , and finally , on the tunnel-connect between crew-compartment and pressurized modules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contractors with NASA itself . On the Courier , of course , all suppliers had had to be USA . He 's kept his long since diversified company out of application software , which he regards as pure flea-market and discount-store hell . " Nowadays I only know the charts , Gilpin . And the bankers . Not even the engineers . Amazing , is n't it . " " Not to me . " " That 's right . Heard you speak once . " " Oh ? Oh , I 'm only in the middle , far as dreaming goes , " Gilpin says hastily . " Wobbly place . " " The lad does n't think so . " In the silver-brown luminescence of the cabin , composed of many muted reflections of metal gone angle-soft under outer shadows which come and go , producing that rotogravure effect which once gave depth to faces in early-century Sunday supplements , they 're all learning to translate facial expressions anew . Gilpin 's face has clouded . But so has the porthole . " Mole ? The boy 's pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mulenberg stares down at his page of daughters . So are they all  --  adventure . Sure they know , and hit you with it . But Gilpin , who 's childless , romanticizes . Any confidences are wasted on him . " Guess I 'm the only parent in Cabin Six . " " So far . " When Gilpin does n't respond further , he 's moved to personalize him/self . Like when the staff used to hold back . " I say lad ' maybe because the head nurseryman at my father 's place used to . Used to call me that . " And maybe because I have n't got one . " A lad is a boy with a nice streak of cussedness , ' Dineen used to say . " " Mole 's got that . " " Spends a lot of time up front . Forward . " " That berth he 's been exchanging with Lievering now and then , yes . But they do n't allow him in the cockpit . " " The  --  ? I should think not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain  --  " " Training knowledge ? " Gilpin seems now to want to swap glances with him . " Being pals with Lievering should sure give him the hang of it . But the young ones all take everything once-over easy . " Except Maidie . Who 's like him . It 's Maidie he could tell about following Veronica from that half-craved distance . " Tried to get him to talk about architecture ; we 've built factories around the world . But nix . Sure does n't sound like what he is . Or act it . What the devil is a catabolist ? " Gilpin 's laugh loosens up both of them . " It 's a fancy school of Japanese architectural theory . More mystical than structural . Seems to work . It 's not new . Started in the fifties . " These days it 's the young who are the antiquarians of the decades . Falling in love with their grandfather 's era , though not with its real properties . " He says he 's lost interest , in favor of another profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Reformer , student grade ' ? " " Private , first-class . ' " When Gilpin throws up his hands the second book he 's been reading sprawls  --  a small , dowdily old one , exotic on a floor which might be metal or grapholite . " We ought n't to laugh , " Gilpin says . " None of our family has humor , " Mulenberg says shyly . " I wish the girls . " They both bury themselves in their " work . " Gilpin takes up his pencil : " I like Mulenberg , poor chap . What an extraordinary thing  --  one of Veronica 's one-night stands to come so far . A man of considerable personal resource who is always deprecating that ; he knows too well what the world usually thinks of tycoons . Here I 'm a man suspended from my money , ' he told me our first hour here , ' want to see how Ip347do . ' Yet he was clearly that , before . A space-dreamer all his life ? Since he suffers from a poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NASA blueprint of the vehicle , which he 's learned by rote . He 's used to being coached by experts . Goddard sent him three to get him through the training , which he then crammed into half the time it took the rest of us , getting a deserved top score  --  a feat I heard nothing of from Mulenberg himself . Look at him , tending his data like a purist , hoping for the time  --  vainly I suspect  --  when he can dispense with it . It bothers him that I call the flight deck a cockpit . Up to now , his forays into self-knowledge have all been one-night stands also . Down beneath them is this other tenacious life of the emotions he 's been taught to be ashamed of  --  which he 'll peel to the bone to get to . Yes , I like him . He is my opposite . " I say poor chap ' because of Veronica . Who 's known where she is since she was born , and wants only to go farther . Who maybe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gilpin watches it sway on its chain . The claustrophobiaof any space journey adheres not only to the vehicle but to the motion . One 's walled up  --  in motion . A coffin of it , after a while static as a train at standstill in a station . Past which all eternity wheels . The pencil crept toward him slightly . Not a delusion . Whatever degree of gravity is here , whatever air mix , Mulenberg will know , or know the place for it in his file . But the idea of the " delusions " Mulenberg alleges he 's beginning to collect on his own is unnerving . " Baby idees fixes , " he said yesterday , " can run through an office like wild rabbits . " And journeys with a sense of mission breed abstractions of no more value than imaginary music ; people think windily on Everest . What Gilpin would n't give for an old jet-liner crowd of ordinary travelers weaving their to-and-from-the-toilet rhythms . Florida-bound couples in identical vanilla checks and with the irritable lardiness of pensioners . Or one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with profiles sharp as their portfolios . If he and Mulenberg and the others come to share some idee-fixe which can pass for real , what then ? " The hazard here is eerieness , " Gilpin says aloud . " It attracts . Like an emotion . " Or it does me . But there 'll be no opera in another town to fly me to . Maybe we can learn to wrap and unwrap one another in hot sheets . I like the design of the sick bay . Our cabin seems a tough community . Except for its persistent young guest  --  who thinks himself the toughest of all . Wonder how the other cabins have done ? I lard top348keep in mind that there are four such sick bays and four Free Rooms like this one , for a total of twelve passenger cabins , plus that cabin of whistlers , the relief crew . Plus all those on the flight deck  --  how many ? We shall see . In little more than a week . He sits up straighter . Even in the Free Room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has an array of newspaper clips spread before him , has n't responded . The so-called silence here is cellular , capable of growth , composed of many small auricular coils of approach . The core of one 's hearing is always being scratched . It 's not unpleasant . But if Gilpin had a piano keyboard he would skitter it from bass to treble with the back of his hand . Or if he had a tuba  --  give one hippo snort . In his time he 's played both , badly . He sees by the built-in ship 's clock that the free hour , actually an hour and a half , will soon be half up . " Stars do n't twinkle here . " Gilpin stares out through the thermal pane . " Rude of them . " Far up ahead the wing rides steady as a coastline . Made of honeycomb aluminum . Mulenberg pushes his half-lens reading-glasses up onto his Triton head of hair . He seems never to remember he can look over them . On his face is the blank smile of scholarship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilpin knows this already . " Sorry . " His clips are disposed on the flip-out desk in front of him like a wreath of witnesses to what is still called " the space effort "  --  as if outer space is a still recalcitrant part of creation which refuses to recognize its own potential . It was in collecting this batch that Mulenberg , on one of the impulse errands by which he now and then removed himself from routine , had gone himself to the newly non-corporate floor in the Gulf &; Western Building on which the clipping agency lodged , and there in that obscure cul-de-sac had caught sight of Veronica emerging from another elevator , so intent on a brace of shoulder bags marked **26;10285;TOOLONG This End Up that she had n't seen him . A person had opened an adjacent door marked in dusty brown , THE SHEET , and had helped her in with them . Inside the clipping agency , standing at the counter at which Anythingin the World could be potentially furnished him , he had n't been able to demand it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass-connected beyond what it supposed . A minute later he said , " Give me anything you have on The Sheet . " His own Tessa subscribed to it . Later a secretary went back to get the file on the Courier . " Here  --  they 've mixed the Courier clips with more stuff on that rag , The Sheet  --  are n't they something ? I would n't use them again . " To him that loadp349in her arms seemed to issue out of some proper voodoo in which two lives were being wooed to their space-slot in destiny .

There are facts in his file which seem to belong most to her.  --  Did you know , Maidie , that the younger a woman is , the more sensitive to startle from sonic boom ?

And there are plenty who will not . Who will be left here to preserve this kingdom . Some who will be left behind because he is weary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , see how they study each other , behind masks of smiles and manners , the nosegays of inconsequential talk . To whom ( each is wondering ) has the King made promises ? How can it be determinedwhich are sheep and which are goats ? They are like exegeticalpedants , each one seeking to gloss every wrinkling of the King 's forehead , the least rising or knitting of the King 's eyebrows . They aim to translate the language of light in his eyes , to read fortunes in his laughter . And he would laugh out loud at this comedy if he were not , in his own estimation , the chief clown of it . So it is , he thinks , that we are all shackled . Like galley slaves at their oars . So goes this world on its long voyage . . . . Late in January he was told that the Queen had left her Palace of Whitehall in Westminster somewhat suddenly . Had moved the Court to Richmond Palace . Not long after came reports that she was now suffering from failing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be sure . And at her age any illness or indispositioncould easily become her last . He had been advised by allies , here as well as in England , to move his own Court to Holyroodhouse , so as to be close by the walls and the powerful castle of his chief city and so as to be near to the end of the long road north from London . Here he should be in case the news does come . At first post riders seemed to be arriving in troops , and within this fortnight a special messenger from the Queen 's cousin , Sir Robert Carey , came with news that the end is near and that the King should stand in readiness . But now , most likely because of the wild cold weather , there has been no news from Richmond Palace . Perhaps there is no news to report . Perhaps there will be none . Perhaps even those first reports were not wholly to be credited . For all in England who send reports to him know the words he wants most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important news for him . Which the weather is withholding . Or perhaps the bearers of the news have been prevented ( by English enemies ? ) from coming to him . Who can know ?  |p261Who  is to be trusted ? If wishes come true , some of these men , his tried and true hunting companions , will ride south beside him for the longest and best hunt of all . If all his hopes are now to be dashed , then he and all these men ( and many more besides ) will make the journey south in armor . May God forbid that ! For the idea of the battlefield weakens and sickens him . Yet it has become necessary that his nobles and gentlemen should be sworn . As long ago as late ' 99 , the earls and barons and lords of Scotland wrote and signed " A General Bond Made by the Good Subjects of the King 's Majesty for the Preservation of His Highness ' Person and the Pursuitof his Undoubted Right of the Crown of England and Ireland . " In which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gear " to the King 's cause . Did so , to the King 's amusement , in language and phrases which arrogantly parody the Bond made by the EnglishCourt and Council many years before , against his mother , the Queen of Scots . By now , more privately ( for he was told that the Bond of ' 99 outraged the English Queen ) , all have sworn , if it should come to that , to go forth to kill or to be killed for the sake of his claim . That prospect stuns him . For , all private scruples aside , if it should come to open war , then win or lose , in victory or in defeat , many of these men will never gain more than at most six feet of English earth to call their estates there . That has happened before , to their grandfathers and time and again before that to generations beyond counting . Still , some of these hot-blooded men seem to be eager to tempt God and to test His providence . There is talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges of swords and axes . No talking of it in his presence . He will not tolerate such talk . And they know the rumor how even the sight of a drawn and naked blade offends him . They do not speak of weapons when the King is in earshot . But he hears what he hears and knows what he knows . In one sense it is well for the English to know that oaths have been taken and that preparations are being made in Scotland . But the King shudders to think on it . Because in war and in defeat ( which all men know can come to pass from a loose nail in a single horseshoe ) he might find himself King of no kingdom , north or south , ruler of nothing . Yet and still , despite all these doubts , he does not fear the fu/ture . It is sufficient to have endured the past and to spend his fear on the present . How much will wind and rain , these long nights , muddy roads , swollen streams , and flooding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A day or two , perhaps even a few hours , could make the difference between success and failure , war and peace , crown or no crown . Wind rattles the windowpanes at Holyroodhouse . Cold rain spurts from spouts and splashes in the courtyards . Smoke coughs in the fireplace . The King 's legs , though warm at last , have commenced to ache from too much standing . He calls out for a chair and a footstool for his feet . And he calls for another cup of spirits . Settling on the cushions of the chair , raising his feet on the soft stool , sipping from a tall , ample cup , he can close his eyes and picture a horseman riding north . Can see a horseman shrouded by a long cloak and bent low to his horse . Moving slowly , ever so slowly , against wind and rain , toward Scotland . Can picture the image of that horseman clearly , perfectly . But not the rider 's face . Try as he will , he can not imagine whether the news coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the valley of Skerne and crossing the Tees on a stone bridge of three arches into Yorkshire . " Shake a bridle over a Yorkshireman 's grave and he 'll rise from the dead and steal your horse . But , never mind , you can drown your sorrow if they do . For there 's no place in England to match it for the strength of its ale . " Lonely riding through marshy ground broken only by fording the River Wiske . Till he comes to Codbek , spanned by a single stone arch , and leading into Northallerton . Village of solid limestonehouses facing a single length of street . A prosperous place on account of the cattle-and-horse fair , but its castle 's no more than ruins and the name of Castle Hill . Then seven miles and a way bit to Topcliffe , sitting on a low hill and marked by the embattledtower of the parish church of St. Columba . Crosses an old timber bridge above the dark swift water of the Swale . Near to the road are vines of black grapes like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with trees few and not much sign of plowing and planting . Country riddled by brooks and streams . Good grass for grazing . Mobs of sheep . At sixteen miles from Topcliffe to pass through the ancient Forest of Galtres . So cut and thinned of timber that only the name is left to bear witness to the oaks that grew there . To the wolves and bear and red deer . To hunters and hunted who ran in the shade , then vanished forever with it . Soon to arrive at York , second city of England , set on both banks of the River Ouse and safely contained within a three-mile circuit of white stone walls . All overlooked by the towers of thep266largest cathedral in this country  --  York Minster , Church of St. Peter . Made of the same stone as the town walls , still splendid with stained-glass windows as fine as any in this world .

Oh in the high and golden days there were forty churches here and four monasteries and four friaries and sixteen hospitals and nine guildhalls and two castles and five strong towers ! Now since Dissolution and the disastrous Pilgrimage of Grace there has been steady decline . Though it remains the seat of the Archbishop of York . And a seat of government . For the old Abbot 's House of St. Mary 's Abbey ( now called King 's Manor ) is palace for the Council of the North . Entering near the Manor through the north gate called Bootham Bar . Going perhaps to the Blue Boar or maybe the Bridge Inn near to the river to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very piles of the ancient Roman one . Ten miles across fertile country of growing grain . With patches of woodland . Planted with oak and ash and elm for standard . Tall lime trees , their yellow flowers besieged by clouds of bees . Next a fine bridge of eight arches , crossing the Wharfe into the village of Tadcaster . Best known for brewing and truly famous for horseshoes . Fording the little Cock Beck beyond the southern end of the village he now has a dozen miles before Wentbridge . Fording the Aire at Ferrybridge he has only four miles remaining he 'll come down a hill to a stone bridge of five arches set over the Went . Then uphill again and gone across open country . Aiming for the innyard of the Angel in brick-walled Doncaster . Where the River Don runs wide and cloudy . Busy town with watermills by the river and brick kilns within the walls . With markets forp267wool and leather . And with a celebrated cattle fair . Solid timber houses with slate roofs and well shaded by elms . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for wagerson the wide Town Moor . If only he still had his little Scots mare and time to spend . Then he would linger long enough to relieve some Yorkshiremen of their prosperity . But he must be gone . First through sandy country to the village of Bawtry . A poor place with a few shabby half-timbered houses set close to a little pond . Lying low and swampy next to River Idle . Then farewell to Yorkshire and welcome to Nottingham . Road running through flat red-clay fields . To Scrooby ( a mere hamlet only ) with its large moated manor house for the Archbishop of York . Crossing Barnby Moor to the tile-making place of Petford , set on both banks of the Idle . Thence over Markham Moor to the hills around Tuxford , with apple trees planted . Then down into the town , houses of brick and tile and limestone barns for the crops of wheat and beans . With two large inns  --  the old Crown ( where they tell you Princess Margaret Tudor rested on her way to become Queen of Scotland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running flat and straight for ten miles among the branches of River Trent . Seeing the narrow , shallow-draft boats of that river . And at deeper places seeing barges with sails . Keeping watch for the spire ( one of the tallest in England ) of the Church of St. Mary Magdalen . From miles away marking the center of Newark . Now crossing the river there on a wooden bridge . Passing close by walls and gatehouse of the Castle that Edward the Confessor first built . And where ( as story goes ) King John died from eating peaches given to him by the monks of Swineherd . Through streets toward Beast Market Hill , and into the cobblestoned marketplace . It 's a brewing and malting town ( for the cool , calm , amber-colored water of the Trent is most excellent for brewing ) and a famous cattle market too . And Newark 's a town of many inns all close by the market  --  the Saracen 's Head and the Angel and Maiden 's Head and Cardinal 's fiat and Trip to Jerusalem and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thep268elegant timber-and-plaster White Hart with a gallery overlooking the market . Then out by South Gate and into the flat fen country . Sometime , while he was still a child , this man now calling himselfScarecrow or Beanstalk for the fun of it , must have come to the attention of William Cecil . And soon after would have come under his patronage . Sir William Cecil to whom he therefore owes everything he is and is not , all he has done or had to leave undone . For whom his deepest feelings will always be deeply mixed . His picture of pleasure comes directly from the hospitality of the Cecils . He 's almost certain to base it upon the recollection of dinnertime with Cecil and his family . Dinner as served in the Hall at Stamford Baron or at the Canon Row house or , later , with Queen Mary dead and Elizabeth crowned , when he had returned from exile to rejoin the Cecil household , at the old Rectory at Wimbledon . Anywhere they were , where , now as then , all things will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff-necked , self-righteous rigidity or of haughty ostentation . Table linens , cloths and napkins , always snowy . Spoons of silver gleaming and knives sharp and the plate and tall salt shining in candlelight . The bread , only the best manchet or wheaten bread , is well baked with never least stain of burned crust that must be scraped off . The fish or meats , the fowls and salads , the cheeses and fruits , will all be fresh and abundant . Never crudely disguised in sauces or hidden in a cloud of spices . Beer will be new brewed ; cider will be the best pressing , never musty and sour ; wines will never be cloudy , but clear and crisp and only lightly sweet , without any cloying aftertaste . Servants will be neatly dressed , with clean hands and faces , moving to and from the kitchen and pantry , or to and from the sideboard with cups and glasses , as quick and as quiet as shadows . And there will not be talk of affairs of state or of business , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) if the Spaniard or the Turk or the Moor were busy bombarding the walls and battering the gates of London . It may be there will be a consort of music coming from the minstrels ' gallery or from behind the carved screen of the hall , but most often there will be a topic for con/versation . Cecil will lead the talk , his fine handsome face , composed of delicate features , lively and animated ; his dark eyes beneath a high smooth forehead , capturing the candlelight . Leading and directing , like a musician himself , as if talk were music , engaging all who are seated at table by his continual curiosity and , especially , by his attention for each person present . During those dinner conversations at the Cecils ' it seemed possible to have his thoughts taken seriously , to take himself seriously .. . . After rising from table , unless there happened to be some truly extraordinary and unavoidable business , there was always a leisurelytime spent in the garden or , if the weather were poor , then in the parlor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's colloquy not tossed aside , but continued , expanding its boundaries . William Cecil will labor as long as any farmhand at harvest ( and often , also , far into the night ) , wearing his clerks and servantsinto early old age with him . Yet there will be no sense of that  --  weariness of labor done , tedium of work to follow  --  imposingupon the pleasure of the dinner hour . " And there will never be any unseemly hurry , either , at the times set aside for prayer and worship . I can imagine that one day there may well be rabble and soldiery  --  bands of inimical Frenchmen , of Spaniards , Flemings , Germans and Italians , every Lord have mercy on us ! , of rowdy Scots  --  directly at Cecil 's gatehouse . And yet I believe that the entire office of The Book of Common Prayer , from opening sentences and General Confessiondown to last words of the Collect for Grace , would be offered up . And as calmly and sedately as ever . " From the example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live well , even richly , in this world and yet without pride and vanity . Learned , too , that a man can fare deliciously ( in all things ) without waste . That he can cultivate sober elegancewithout relinquishing the refinements of simplicity . Yet this simplicity can be deceptive . Take , for instance , the newly acquired and newly refurbished house Cecil has established for himself in Westminster , an imposingbrick building with four tall embattled towers and wide , paved courtyards , standing on the north side of the Strand , acrossp270from Russell House . The messenger will see it for the first time at the end of this journey and will see so much of his master in the choice of that place for his city establishment . A house which is strong and plain , then , proud without ostentation . And he will find it ( as he might expect ) well equipped and appointed inside . Where the guest or visitor may be startled by the contrast betweenoutward simplicity and inward beauty . Cardinal Wolsey would never have understood it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich city merchant would . More than that , the merchantwill appreciate it , seeing Cecil as more like himself than the nobility . Those who do not know him well will consider the simplicity of his residence , and its location on the north side , facingroad and not river , to be proper for Mr. Secretary . **28;10396;TOOLONG . Appropriately unenviable , indicating the man 's awareness of the limits of his ambition . Others , friends and allies , take delight from this slight duplicity ( a plain cloth glove disguising jeweled fingers ) which Cecil wisely practices against the unimaginative . Who must be protectedagainst envy and malice . Indeed , they must be protected from knowledge that they lack power which is commensurate with their image of themselves . Friends and allies will appreciate this . Seeing that , in truth , Cecil does not wish to aspire to climb too high too quickly . They will see how ( in the most serious sense ) discreet Cecil is . The messenger understands this well ; for , in a different way , he has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago learned ( else he would not be here to prove it ) that those who are weak must be encouraged to feel as strong as they would like to be . And the powerful must be generously unchallenged lest their deepest fears  --  that strength will fail them , will vanish like a sunbeam  --  shouldbe exposed . Child of his times , William Cecil has to be fearful also . And in some ways which this messenger , his servant , does not imagine . For , Cecil , with good reasons , has come to doubt not only the Queen 's continuing favor toward him ( is not the Earl of Leicester , an enemy when all 's said and done , closest to her of any man alive ? ) , but also her ability to defend this kingdom from fractious elements within and from the tightening ring of implacableforeign enemies which surrounds even as the sea does thisp271island . Elizabeth has already ruled longer than her brother or her sister . All odds are against a long life . Twice already she has been sick enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own fortune . What he fears is the ruin of all the world as he knows it . Nor can the messenger imagine how much Cecil , overburdenedand overworked , driven by his many duties , has aged beyond his years . His joints ache from more than common English ague . His bowels trouble him . His feet swell and wince from gout . Too often precious energy fails him . He is an old man ( disguised ) in middle years . Occasionally a journey to Bath , or to the blue warm bubbling springs in high Buxton , seems to restore him somewhat . But not for long . Cecil has come to believe that chances are he can not serve for many more years . Not many , even among those closest to him , can have guessed this . For Cecil has , since youth , affected a grave dignity , an old man 's careful self-possession . And his discipline is such that he could probably maintain a soft voice and a smiling mask even if his feet were on fire . And so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir William Cecil 's rush to regain the old and to build up the new . On the one hand there is the haste to finish as much as he can before it is too late . Hoping , against the odds , that he will be able to leave an estate , something of real value , for his sons and daughters , his old mother and his widow . Especially for the two sons , the bearers of his name . What sadness ( and irony ) there ! Thomas , a wild youth , ne'er-do-well and , it seems , lazy and ill educated and self-indulgent , but still the eldest and first born , child of Mary Cheke , Cecil 's first wife , dead more than twenty years ago . And now a new half brother Robert , three years old , quick of mind but small and sickly . Robert who , even if he lives to become a man , can not be expected to come to much . If only there were a way to graft some of little Robert 's intelligence upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospects of his sons have worn Cecil more than his body 's pains . Still , it is his Christian duty to have faith in the future and to provide for it . And if in the end he should fail , and if this estate , these houses with their extraordinary accumulation of rich andp272beautiful and worthy things , should come not into the hands of lawful heirs , but into the possession of others , unimagined strangers or perhaps even known enemies , still there will be some undeniable harvest of honor there . If these things of this world are truly worthwhile , then chances are that they will be well cared for by whoever takes possession of them . Even deadly enemies . True , his coat of arms may be painted or plastered over . Indeedhis very name may be erased , struck , blotted , cut from every paper and all records and documents . His tomb and monumentcan be defaced or destroyed . And yet , even if only in stubbornmemory , it will be known that once upon a time William Cecil was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is forgotten , too , then the things themselves , being preserved preciselybecause they are beautiful and worthy , will carry some sense of being , to perfect strangers . Who will be compelled to wonder at what they can not imagine  --  who owned these splendid things ? Whatever else , gigantic footprints will have been left by him . Yet there is another motive , a better and wiser one , which even Sir William Cecil may be unable to define clearly . At the same time that he is seeking to preserve something against the ruins of time , his desire is also to perform an act of good faith for his sovereign . Against the promptings of reason ; against the weight of the odds ; against the examples of history as he knows them ; surely against the strong tide of events , as he perceives that tide to be running ; it is an act of faith in ( still young at thirty-two years ) Elizabeth the Queen . Faith that she will rule long enough and in peace and prosperity and safety , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also , that by Providence he will be permitted to continue in her service , and that she will continue to reward him for it . A sad and witty way of thanking the Queen for her bounty even as he is asking her for more . His courtly way of telling her that he understands and approvesof her weakness for brave and extravagant gestures . His counselor 's way of reminding her that there is a futurewhich must be prepared for . . . .  |p273.  .. and soon  --  broad and wet beneath pale skies  --  in Lincolnshire . Called land of yellow bellies , for there are more frogs and eels than men there . The rider suddenly there , startling a flapping and whistling of waterbirds from the reeds , shivering aspen and willow as he 's gone again leaving dust clouds and mud clods behind . Up and down Gonerby Hill ( highest between Edinburgh and London ) and into Grantham on the Witham , town of red-roofed , half-timber and brick houses . Changing horse at the Angel , then up steep Spitalgate Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals . To arrive at last at the ancient town of Stamford ... . " Where at the age of seven , armed with a new satchel to carry books and papers , with a sharp penknife and some candles , I was sent to Stamford School in St. Paul 's Street . " Never to forget the hard benches where they sat , two boys sharing each of the slanted oak desks set in rows in a heavybeamed , high-ceilinged room . " Cold as a key in a door it was in wintertime , and my nose alwayssniffing and running and my fingers as stiff as twigs . In summer afternoons it was as sweaty as a chimney corner . Laboringwinter and summer under the unblinking gaze of the tall , thin , weary Master , perched up there on a stool in front of the schoolroom , with a supple birch rod in his hands like a wand of high office . Behind us , unseen and always felt , was the Usher spying on us . I tell you it was a long , heavy-lidded , fart-rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day , too , except for Sunday . " Learning Latin by heart through ceaseless exercises of recitation . Never to forget the weight and feel of William Lily 's grammarand Nicholas Udall 's Flowers of Latin Speaking . Trained to read and write , in prose and verse , in the slowly dying tongue of Caesar and Cicero and Terence , of Horace and Virgil and Ovid . . . . " And all things taught , enforced upon memory as it were , to the sharp tonne of a fertile laid smartly across an open palm or swollen knuckle ! , . And often enhanced by the swish and smack ofp274the Master 's birch rod as it made acquaintance with the wincing bare flesh of my backside . " Though let me say , as I learned later , it was better at Stamfordthan elsewhere . For , bless him and thanks be , Mr. Cecil has always disapproved of too much use of the rod on young students . Except for necessary matters of discipline . " He will pass along Stamford 's High Street , going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole row of inns , one of which , the Tabard , is partly owned by Cecil . But will not change horses there , but will continue to the bank of the Welland and go into Northamptonshire on narrow Packhorse Bridge . Past Cecil 's parish church of St. Martin and then in less than a mile to enter the outer gateway leading to Six William Cecil 's country estate . Where he 'll have a strong fresh horse and a better saddle . Where he 'll receive a replenished purse and some food and drink in the huge high-vaulted kitchen ( all that is left of the monastery that was here ) with its hundreds of burnished copper pots and fireplace large enough to roast an ox whole . No time for more than snatches of news in kitchen and stables . But time enough to marvel at the confusion as a swarm of masonsand carpenters and joiners and glaziers and craftsmen of all kinds ( Englishmen and strangers too from Flanders and France ) hurry to ready the place for the Queen next month . And what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow-gray stone called Barnack Rag . And set around a large courtyard with a tall four-story turreted gatehouse and large angle towers at the corners . The walls of the house are a wonder of mullioned glass windows . And a roofscape like a wild forest with turrets and pinnaclesand vanes and balustrades and decorative miniature castles . With chimneys grouped and pillared as in the Tuscan fashion . All of this set amid thirty acres ( not counting the six miles of park and woods and ponds ) of orchards and gardens . For the growing of every kind of herb and flower needed for health and for contentment . Every kind of bush and shrub and tree for berriesand nuts and fruit . On this subject the messenger will hear of lemon trees and or/ange trees and even a pomegranate tree recently planted . To be maintained by continual and exquisite care . " Better to be an orange tree than a poor man . " He will see women busy with yards of cloth being cut and sewn to make new livery for servants . Old servants drilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and good manners . Thanks to the Lord he has no part to play in all of this . And must be gone . To carry more letters and papers and reportsfrom here to Cecil in Westminster , given into his hands by the new Steward  --  Mr. Thomas Bellot . Who does not know him from any other dusty horseman passing through . Just as well . Finishes food and drink and leaves the kitchen to keep on riding . For London . Which is now some ninety miles away . Having done well enough at Stamford School , he was packed off , across the stream-stitched miles east of Stamford to study at Cecil 's own College of St. John the Evangelist in Cambridge . And , thanks to Cecil 's generosity as a full-fledged pensioner , beholdento no man . Except to his patron . Required to wear , outside his chambers , a plain and sober academicgown . Not like the few sons of the nobility allowed to affect gaudy colors or to wear satins or velvets or silks . Nor permitted to wear a sword . Required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free as old Adam to disregard . To risk the consequences , fines , and loss of privileges . And , for certain offenses , to risk the humiliation of a public whipping in the Hall . Which rules and consequencesnever served wholly to inhibit him ( or most of his fellow students ) from their full share of japes and pasquils . Times of drunken bell pulling . Times of panting flight from proctors and porters . Times of ( strictly forbidden ) swimming in the Cam . Meantime he studied at logic and rhetoric , trivium and quadrivium . Attended lectures and disputations . Was exposed to the excellentinstruction in Greek to be had at St. John 's . Acted in Latin plays in the college Hall . And followed the advice of Cecil , paying a fee to the collegep276bell ringer to come and wake him at four o'clock in the morning . So that he might have an extra hour for his studies . Mostly his memories now are of weather . Often , and especially if he is possessed by a melancholy humor , this remembered weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray . Cold mists rising up , ghostlike from gray earth and gray water , partly concealing the twisted shapes of gray leafless trees . All the while a light rain is falling out of a low sky whose clouds are the texture of muddy wool . Sees himself there , too , small and shivering , thorn-jointed from damp and cold , his hidden flesh a landscape of goosebumps . Can see , as if from a bird's-eye view , this figure of himself with one or two others  --  for the rule is they must always go at least in pairs  --  leaving chambers on the south side of the court at St. John 's . Floating across the courtyard in their gowns like a little squadron of black-sailed ships . Coming outside through the gate onto the cobbles of the street . All of them ignoring what fog anyway mostly disguises  --  not merely the towered , three-storied grandeur of brickwork and stone that is the college gatehouse , but , over and above the arch of the gate , a wonder of rose and blue and gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lady Margaret Beaufort , Countess of Richmond and mother of King Henry VII . Showing , beneath the brightly painted statue of St. John , the arms of England and of the Tudors and the Beauforts . Crowned rose and portcullis . Daisies and borage . And even a pair of spotted yales  --  proud beasts so seldom to be found outside of books , sporting tail of an elephant , body of an antelope , and head of a goat ... . " I am not yet old enough or forgetful enough to cherish the illusionthat my youth was a springtime . " And yet , nonetheless , unquenchable and irrepressible , like flame catching kindling , sometimes an image of the Cambridge springtime will overwhelm him . Trees in flower , their leaves as delicate as if beaten into shape and brightness by goldsmiths . Rinsed air trembling with the wings of butterflies . Sky embroidered with birdsongs . And not only the gardens , but also the grass of yards and fields , the banks of the swollen river , surging with crowds of flowers . Such opulence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces of Joseph 's coat of manyp277colors ; how certain rebellious ( reforming ) angels have just now broken one of heaven 's windows and these , then , are joyous fragmentswhich have fallen in a silent storm to gravel the reawakeningearth with all the colors and shades of hoping . But most often he will find himself recalling the weeks of Septemberbefore Michaelmas and before the beginning of term . The harvest is in . The reapers have swept across the fields , stoopingand kneeling with their sickles . Corn has been cut and stacked , left afield a brief time to dry , then carted home to the barns . Stubble has been mowed for gathering straw and for stover . Harvest supper has been held in halls and churchyards . And now the sky goes blue and gold and the light changes , castinglong shadows . Time for the Stourbridge Fair , set in the fields between NewmarketRoad and the river . With people coming there from all the shires and from Scotland and the Continent . To buy and to sell and to pleasure themselves . Strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cookfires , mingling with the scents of the enormousmarket of spices and herbs . Hearing the languages of other places and the dialects twisted out of his own tongue , falling on his ears as if these words were being sung . Taste of foreign foods , tingling the mouth . Sight of strange faces , with different cuts and lengths of beard and hair . Sporting so many different kinds of clothing . Moving among the crowds and touching , say , soft furs worn by a Dane or a Hanse merchant , perfumed leather of a French wine dealer , or sleek Italian silk of a Venetian here to sell the spices of the East . To feel and to heft the sweatslick weight of foreign coins in his palms . Moving amid the profusion of sounds and broken music of voices , he could hear an inner voice telling him , with the sad solemnitywhich only youth can manage , that never , ever again beyond the limits of Stourbridge Fair would he experience any of these things again . He was not able to imagine days to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among strangers in other countries . Times when it would be a matter of life and death to comprehend the languages and dialects of others . Times when it would he necessary to speak and even to act like a native . Mercifully he was unable to envision days to come when the least coninion sights , sounds , and odors of England wouldp278seem as strange to him as anything in distant lands . Times when , dreaming himself back , would find himself hungry for the simplestthings of England . Only now , years later , can he perceive how those careless , alewarmedSeptember days , spent in wandering the Stourbridge Fair , were more practical apprenticeship for the life he would have to live than all of his other courses of study at the college taken together . Soon after the Fair comes fall and the beginning of the new term . The light is now like wine in a clear Venetian glass . And the days end with sunsets like the coals of a dying fire . The moon too rises slow and huge and fat , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to the owls . As days become the property of rooks and crows and gulls gleaning the fields . Which now must be turned and plowed and well spread with dung . And the firewoodfor winter cut and hauled and stacked close at hand . The year 's last fruits must be brought in and carefully stored . And one final skywide fountaining of swifts and swallows before they vanish from the bleak air . Then the rains begin again . " Well , let rain patter on the roof and run down the spouts . No matter to us . For we shall sit by a fire and enjoy the end of the season . With new cider . With hazelnuts and roasted chestnuts . We shall darken our teeth and our tongues with the sticky sweetness of new-picked blackberries . " And so , resurrecting autumn , he recollects the place more clearly . The colleges , built around their courts behind walls and gates and thin turreted , battlemented gatehouses ; the halls and hostels , the inns with their huge signs and the vivid colors of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old castle facing the Fens at the north edge of town , down past St. Giles and Magdalen College , then crossing the river on that old five-arched bridge of stone and timber . Following Bridge Street for a couple of hundred yards , past the church of St. Clement 's to the corner of the High Street . . . . " Where was I ? " Oh yes , with my companions , I had just left the gatehouse ofp279St . John 's . Turned right to walk briskly past elegant Trinity , shabby Glonville , and next King 's .. . . " Just beyond that still-abuilding college , standing gray and white , alone and wetly shining on a wide field of sparse grass and tree-lined paths , is the newly completed Chapel , a line of slim pinnacled buttresses which somehow magically hold not merely the weight of an enormous roof of timber and lead , but also the long walls so pierced with tall windows as to seem to be made mostly of stained glass . And these windows are still whole and shining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have broken as many windows in and around Cambridge as elsewhere in England . These are still all of a piece even though King 's is a powerful center for the reform of religion . And so it is that on rare , sunkindled days , a certain slanting light will transform this Chapel . Making it seem not to have been made of timbers and cut stones set on the solid earth , but instead mysteriously composed of something else , something insubstantiallike woodsmoke or ground fog . Sometimes the light of a still and windless dawn , silhouetting this Chapel , will cast its reflection , wavering but whole , upon the surface of the Cam . Sometimes , seeking to follow that floating image to its source , he has entered the Chapel to walk the length of the Antechapel and the choir . Inwardly rejoicing as he saw those windows broadcast many-colored lights . Which ( he imagined ) are the coinage of heaven . Looking up , above that spindriftcolor , above the carved-oak screen , above all monuments and heraldic emblems and ciphers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the windows , looking all the way up to where the delicate , intricate vaulted ceiling , defying rules of weight and burden , soars as if to prove the theorems of a new geometry , demonstrating the airy architecture of God 's ( loyal ) angels , he , becoming in that timeless instant as light as a puffball of seed , a dandelion , say , boneless and bodiless , created no longer of clay and dust , but as if now made only out of light and breath , felt able to rise and float and soar into empty air with graceful ease . If only he had possessed full faith ( as much as a mustardp280seed ) to do so . If only he had known the prayer , the words which , like some spell , would free him from the shackles of his doubts . In self-defense now , when doubts seem more an armor than a burden , he will recall his own age in years and the age of the world . To justify such feelings . To explain the times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if by sudden gusts of wind . Maybe he was then ( as he would insist ) as stuffed with idle hopes and false illusions as any Whitsun goose is crammed with bread and spices . Yet if so , he was not alone . So , likewise , were all the others all around him . The whole world was on fire , burningwith change and revision and reform . And Cambridge became a center for it in those ( ah , lost now ) days of the reign of the young King Edward . Who would surely ( no one doubted it ) follow the pattern of his family , his grandfather and father , and live and rule long . Those were days , too , while the King was still young , of rule by the Lord Protector . So they were days not without profit for the Protector 's Secretary  --  Mr. William Cecil . And so not without reasonable hope of future preferment for himself . In fairness to himself , this man can now point to that small , black-gowned figure moving along the High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , the child of one age and time . But also the child ( and victim ) of the timeless condition of youth . A very young man full of the sap and juice of life . Though , of course , hoping then that he might be waking soon , as from a long sleep full of dreams , to find himself a full-grown man . Taking the whole world , past , present , and future , precisely as he found it on a damp early evening , made just as it was and made so just for him , as he and his friends hurried along past the field and the ghostly white shape of the Chapel at King 's without any special thought or feeling beyond the recognition of somethingstanding , as it should , beautifully in its appointed place . They are on their way to the old White Horse Tavern across from the walls of St. Bene't 's , close to the clutter of shops and houses and the buildings of St. Catherine 's . To find a seat or a bench or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Tavernwhich had the ambiguous nickname of Little Germany.  |p281Where  a man can learn all the latest Protestant songs and dances from the Continent  --  including the pure Geneva Jig . By custom , even from times before he was born , debates on religion took place at the White Horse . Here men from the Cambridgecolleges talked freely and openly and passionately . There he listened to subtle , sometimes dangerous discussion of delicate subjects  --  transubstantiation , predestination , the true and proper nature and number of the holy sacraments ; the virtues and faults , strengths and weaknesses , of the newly published Book of CommonPrayer and also the best ways and means for translation of the Scripture into the common tongue ; and thorny questions such as the place of good works if we are justified by faith alone ; and whether or not the Pope in Rome may be taken literally to be the Anti-Christ ; and the place and purpose ( if any ) for altars and images and vestments and candles and incense and all such things and whether these were things adiaphoric and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was any place for these things in a reformed and purified service of worship ; and if there should be , by name and title , any Bishops ; and if priests should marry and whether married people may ever lawfully divorce ; and which stands foremost ( when and if they must come to stand opposed to one another ) , private conscienceor civil and public ordinances . All of it left him speechless and perplexed , yet somehow joyousin his confusion , as he and his friends headed back for the college in the foggy night , broken only here and there by a wall lantern . He can still see himself , a rumple-gowned figure , stumbling along , as they all do , up Mill Street . Going past the high Dutchbrickwalls and the gatehouse of Queens and then coming to the fields just beyond , which are open clear down to the riverside . There 's some talk , then , about a run to the river by the group of them and of a swim there . But that is all swashing braggadocio . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chill water or heart to risk punishment for it . So , instead , turning up a path , they walk to rejoin the High Street . Their voices are raised louder than they may realize in unending discussion as they begin to hurry to reach the college before the gates are locked . Then stop/ping . All gathering around and laughing out loud as one of them , unable to control himself , stands in the narrow lane with his gown hiked up high so that he can piss long and hard , an arching stream hissing and splattering against a wall . And he laughs , too , when he 's able to see that his pissing foolish " student is none other than himself . Next , all the others must join in . And there is a kind of pissing contest . Cut off by bell sounds in the air . Clock striking . Soft bells ringing , muNed by fog , as now they go racing up the pavement , their gowns flying out behind them , each like the tail feathers of a crow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quarter mile to the gate of St. John 's . Just in time . As the porter pulls the gate to and bolts and locks up . They are staggering across the courtyard . Panting too deeply to laugh anymore . And now someone , not himself this time , groans and begins to heave and vomit . And another , someone else ( it must be the Fellow charged with governing them and their chambers ) , has lit a candle and peers down from an open window . He begins to curse them . Promises punishment ... . He can not remember if there was punishment or not . Can not care much , either . For what may have been serious , even fearful for him then is only foolish to him now . " And that 's a blessing , after all . Let us suppose that instead of shedding old fears in forgetfulness , from crib to coffin , we were to accumulate more and more , keeping them as we grow and change from one age to the next . Suppose that we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to acquire our own unique treasury of wounds and scars , each one vividly memorable . Well , sir , if that were so , then to live would be chiefly to wince and to cringe . Past would be insupportable , present unbearable , and the unknown future would be more terrible than both together . " So much has happened to him , to the world as well , in the dozen or so years since he and his friends ran panting and giddy in the night , their young hearts fisting and pounding .

Where Time is the fearful teacher whose punishments are endless.  |p287Excer|pt  from a letter written by Robert Carey , Earl of Monmouth , to Sir Ferdinando Gorges . . . and , all in all , the lad is working out well . Much as I trust your good judgment , Ferdinando , I could scarcely have expected you to find the right man for this techy problem of mine . In my memoir , which I plan to write down before the last coals of my mind have burned out , I shall be speaking to my own posterity . I am writing to my family  --  children andgrandchildren , to be sure . And also , God be willing , to their children and grandchildren and so on for as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now I know , sir , that all your thoughts are set on a course for the future , that your dreams are of the New World now . It may be what keeps your heart and mind younger than your years . You must find my course , tacking slowly and awkwardly against the wind and into my past , a puzzling choice . Maybe a foolish one . And yet I believe we are prompted by something of the same spirit . My destination , though roundabout , is the future also . Be that as it may , I must seek to waken a weak and sleepy memory . And this young fellow is excellent for my purposes . For he listens well . Pays deferential , mannerable attention to an old man . Yet being young and lacking ( as yet ) the fine polish of duplicity , he can not disguise it when his attention wanders away or when the tedinni of my recollections begins to be a yoke on his shoulders.  |p288By  the way , Ferdinando , this fellow would be well advised not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep secrets more closely . What might have been annoyance , even outrage to me , coming from my own servants or ( especially ) from my own kinfolk , is a benefit coming to me from this young scholar . I find myself suing for his attention . Which , though an exercise in humility , is better than losing it without knowing so . Secondly , however , and far more valuable I think , is this  --  that much that I rehearse for him is , clearly , altogether strange to him . From his puzzlement I discover much that we took for granted has either vanished or else become baffling to these young folk . Take , for instance , the wars . . . our wars . These fellows , like this lad here , who grew up in the slack time of peace have no memory of war . None other than our own  --  the recollections of old veterans . Which memories , as we both know , are faulty , more sham than truth , and all the more so as time passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can call up only the image of what they have seen . Poor shabby wretches plucked out of the prisons or pressed into service by brute gangs . Ill fed and ill equipped , poorly trained by fellows who know no more than they do , they are shipped off to die of fever or ague ( if not starvation ) if they are lucky . They have seen the leftover scum of these late disasters , sitting on their stumps of legs at the gates of manor houses , leaning on crutches in marketplaces , begging ... . Having seen these things , what can they believe except that we were madmen to go to the wars ? They can not imagine the wild glories of it . Foolish it may have been , but , Ferdinando , there were times when heart pounded and the blood sang like a choir , when breath was short and sweet and we seemed to carry our very souls like water in our hands . There were times of exaltation worth all the pain and danger . Times when the cries of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like music . For we who heard them were marvelously alive and whole . God forgive me ( God forgive us all ) . But there were bloody times more joyous than anything else I have known . I tell you , Ferdinando , all those years I served as a Warden on the Borders ( always chafing to return to Court ) were thep289happiest years of my life . And if the Wars were not so pleasing , still they were the best schooling I ever had . Only yesterday I was telling him about the siege of Rouen in ' 91 . When we served under Essex and the King of France . Remember that winter ? I was seeking to explain to him the folly of that night scalado we attempted against the walls of St. Catherine 's Castle . How my Lord Essex ordered us to wear shirts over our armor . And how , as a result , I lost most of my shirts that night , which I loaned out to others who proved not so lucky as I. How we crouched in trenches with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord . Trumpet and drums and then forward we ran toward the walls , welcomed by plenty of shot . For they were well prepared for us , though we were somewhat aided by the dark . Running forward with ladders into shot and fire . Then suddenly in retreat , running back the way we had come , still peppered and falling , tripping and staggering over the bodies of poor wretches who had fallen . Back to the trenches to hide our heads . And then , soon after while we panted like hounds , catching our breath , there came a sudden quiet . And into that quiet came the laughter of the Earl of Essex . " Jesus , Jesus , oh sweet Jesus ! " He was calling out even as he laughed . " Sweet wounds of Jesus , we have done it again . The damned ladders are short by two yards or more ! " How , all of a sudden , after that bloody charge , the stupidity and failure of it , this seemed the greatest jest in all the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to laugh , too ; and the French Papists on the wall began to laugh , unable to contain themselves against the noise of several hundred men laughing as if to empty themselves of laughter forever . Ferdinando , I began to laugh aloud again even as I told of it . He managed a smile , out of his best manners , but he looked at me as he might have looked at a Bedlamite . I sought to explain to him the sense of it . How time and again , in the reign of the Queen , the English scaling ladders had somehow proved to be made too short for walls to be taken . How we did well enough in open field of battle against all manner of enemies , even the Spaniards . We were best of all when besieged ourselves , and we could hold a place as well and as dearly as any soldiers he has ever heard of , ancient or modern . But how , timep290and time again , in attack to scale the enemy 's walls we failed . How it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field littered with dead and crippled Englishmen . " Ah , " he told me . " That is a terrible pity  --  and I can not understand how you could crouch in the trenches and laugh because of it . " " Nor can I , lad . Nor can I. I shall never understand it . But we did so . Laughed until we were spent and gasping for breath , some staggering like drunkards , some rolling on the muddy ground . " " Still , it is strange . " " Well , lad , the best I can tell you is that we laughed with all our hearts and perhaps because we had no tears left by that time . It was laugh or turn to stone . " Since we were talking of the siege of Rouen , I could not let the subject pass without some mention of your valor there . How you saved the lives of my Lord and his best friends ( myself also ) . How we had ridden close to the walls on a fine morning and , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Froggies on the walls . How while they had us thus engaged , they aimed to cut us off from our own people by sending a half a hundred men out of a sallyport . And they would have done so , too , except for you , Ferdinando . You were in command of the trenches that day . And seeing the Froggies come out the sallyport , you led a band of your best men out of the trenches to attack them first . Yourself  --  and indeed half of your men also  --  all unready for combat . In doublet and hose only , no armor . Armed only with a rapier . Outnumbered and poorly armed for it , you and your men came shouting out of the trench . So startled the French that some of them dropped their halberds on the spot . And they ran like a flock of sheep for the safety of the sallyport . There was a great volley of shot from the ramparts . And I think ( do I remember it right ? ) you were sore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound at Rouen , but can not remember when it was . Well , you are much with us still , Ferdinando , with only a limp to show for your French wound . And you were never such ap291prancer or dancer , if I may say so , that the wound has anyway hindered you . Saved all our lives , you did on that occasion . If I have failed to thank you for it , then I do so now . And if I may have thanked you often , well , sir , here 's another . To continue . The innocence of my listening scholar has made me look again at the old world ( somewhat ) through his own eyes . Which is like seeing myself , ourselves , in a peculiar looking glass , one of those which can make us seem fat or thin , short or tall , deformed or beautiful , as the case may be . It is as if he were such a glass and I were making faces in front of it . Which can lead me astray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can also be , I confess , more than a little entertaining . Good Ferdinando , the labor ( and sometimes pain ) of raking my memory must finally please me if it is to succeed . Even the unfortunate fact that he is somewhat of a Puritan in matters of religion has proved a help to me . That he seems to feel himself to be , by birth and education both , my moral superior , is an aid to memory . It is far more gratifying to be able to shock the fellow than it would be to find that my worst excesses could not raise an eyebrow . The other day I told him a tale of you and me , Ferdinando . Since it all happened so many faded years ago , I trust you do not mind my retelling it . But if you do mind , it is too late now . The mischief is done , and all that remains is to smile and to bear it with patience . Good digestion is more important than justice to men of our age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him the story of the hundred-crown wager . About that time when we both had come home to Court from the wars in The Netherlands . How we looked to be rewarded . And how we were not . I told him how , before time frosted and fattened us , you were a handsome fellow and as handsomely dressed , too , as anyone at the Court . How you allowed yourself a certain vanity about your appearance . And why not ? After all , there you were , alive andnot much the worse for wear after hard campaigns in the Lowlands . Where many a good man had found a home beneathp292six feet of wet sod . Those of us who were fortunate enough to be alive had reason to swagger a little . And you more than most . So I proceeded to tell the lad how one evening after supper you and I and some others ( whose names are lost to me now forever ) were playing at cards in my father 's old chambers at Blackfriars . How you happened to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegant fishpond frequented by the finest gentlemen of the Court , you were so highly regarded , on account of your good looks and the excellence of your amorous performance , that you were not asked to pay any fee for their favors . This claim resulted in an harmonious motet of hoots and jeers . One thing led to another until you announced that you were willing to hazard a wager , odds of ten to one , against any of us . If we were to go there together , that , offered a choice , these fancy strumpets would choose you first among all the rest of us . How the others were willing to concede the laurels of the brothel to you . But how I accepted your wager . And I put up ten crowns , against your one hundred , that they would choose me . Up we jumped from the table and brushed and combed and polished ourselves . Put on our swords and called for torches . Then rushed out into the night and directly down to Puddle Wharf . Where it required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bankside . Torches burning brightly and all of us singing cheerful bawdy ballads we had learned ( if nothing else ) in the wars . It 's a wonder we did not wake the Queen in her bedchamber in Whitehall . Landed and made a great show and confusion of paying ( and cheating ) the watermen . Then off we went , all in a drunken pack , following behind you , Ferdinando , who knew the way so well you could have found it blindfolded . Directly to the right door . Much knocking and pounding till the porter came . Then much talking and pleading ( and the payment of a coin or two ) before we could be admitted . At last to stand in the chamber like a rank of soldiers while they were to study us and pick the best men . How they carefully looked us over , one at a time , as we stood there solemn in our best Court finery . And how when they came to look at me , I doffed my cap and made a deep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners , as you and the others may have thought . But because , unknown to you , I had pinned a shiny gold Angel at the center of my head and hair . So when I took off my cap and bowed to the whores , that coin caught the candlelight like a little sun . And , just so , it caught their eyes and hearts . Which was why they chose me for their very own , ignoring you . Carried me away to the upper chambers for a night of pleasure . Whilst the rest of you were left to feed your vanity on astonishment and empty air . Yes , it cost me the price of a gold Angel . Much too much for a night with any whore in London . But balanced against your extravagant wager of one hundred crowns , it provided me with a tidy profit for my pleasure . The moral of which tale  --  as I told you at the time , Ferdinando  --  is never make a wager against a man who has had to gamble for his living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safest wager and take your money for his own . Well , sir . When I told this boy the story , he blushed like a girl . Which led me to the inference that he is not completely unfamiliar with such places . Did he believe the story ? You are wondering . I doubt it . For to believe it he would have to stifle his doubts , good Ferdinando , that the likes of you and I were ever as young and foolish as he is.  |p297A  Monsieur Mon Bon Frere et Cousin le Roy d'EscoseI hope , my dear brother , that my weighty affairs at present may make my lawful excuse for the retardance of the answer to your ambassador , but I doubt not but you shall be honorable satisfied with all the points of his commission . And next , after my own errand done , I must render you my innumerable thanks for such amicable offers as it hath pleased you to make , making you assured that , with God 's grace , you shall never have cause to regret your good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection as ever one prince owed another , wishing all means that may maintain your faithful trust in me , that never will seek aught but the increase of your honor and safety . I was in mind to have sent you such accidents as this late month brought forth . But the sufficiency of master Archibald Douglas made me retain him . And I do render you many loving thanks for the joy you take from my narrow escape from the jaws of death . To which I might easily have fallen but that the Hand of the Highest saved me from that snare . And because the curse of that design rose up from the wicked suggestion of the Jesuits , which make it an acceptable sacrifice to God , and meritorious to themselves , that a King not of their profession should be murdered ; therefore I could keep my pen no longer from discharging my care of your person , that you may not suffer such vipers to inhabit your land . They say you gave leave under your hand that they might come and go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuasions . And account him no subject who entertains them . Make not edicts for scorn ,  |p298but  to be observed . Let them be rebels , and so pronounced , that preserve them . For my part , I am sorrier that they cast away so many goodly gentlemen than that they sought my ruin . I thank God I have taken more sadness for some that are guilty of this murder than bearing them malice that sought my death . I protest before God . But such iniquity will not be hid , be it never so craftily handled . And yet when you shall hear all , you will wonder that one accounted so wise will use such matter foolishly . But no wonder . For then they are given over to depraved feeling , they often make such slip . I have been so tedious that I take pity of your pain , and so will end this scribbling , praying you believe that you could never have chosen a more sure truth , that will never beguile than myself , who daily prays for your long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELIZABETH R.The letter is dated the fourth of October , 1586 . Written in her own hand . Quick , easy , and , as always in those days , legible . But not with such care to suggest any more than an expense of spontaneousthought at the moment of composition . As if she were thinking out loud on the page . Therefore intended to be taken as the truth . It was clear and as straightforward a letter as any she would ever write to him . Yet , even so , it is thick with the shadows of her own inimitable and often times impenetrable style . Crabbed , many have called it . And others say obscure . He thinks now  --  years having past and vanished since then  --  that it is a matter of adroit ambiguities . Devious is the word he would use , thinking it but not speaking it . Subtle is what he would choose to say . It is easy for him to summon up the King of Scots , poet and scholar , poring over the letter . Studying it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( if paintings and drawings and the descriptions of others are to be taken as true ) pouting with annoyancehe is seldom able to disguise.  |p299What  in the world is this woman trying to tell him ? What is it that she is really saying ? Alone as he is , except for the gentle and regular snores of a servantsleeping on a pallet just inside the door of this chamber , Sir Robert Cecil can not help smiling at the King 's puzzlement of long ago . Alone in the late quiet night and , for the moment , feelingsecure in the company of papers . Where he is , after all , most content . Where , even if his eyes are heavy and he nods with sleepiness , he is most completely alert and alive . As it is with the world of clerks , like himself , so it is with kings . They sit still somewhere at the heart and center of the busy hive . Ambassadors , messengers , agents , and adventurers ( yes , even spies and sometimes murderers ) come and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits and pieces . Returning it to itself in shards and coins ( sometimes jewels ) . The Prince sits enthroned at the center . Caged by custom and ceremony . Urgently vulnerable to deceits of flattery and the blunted , softened truths which , so misshapen , are indistinguishablefrom outright lies . Yet somehow the best Princes , those who survive and succeed , can translate false into true . Can , from some broken pieces , imagine and re-create the world anew . Stunning , dazzling power and freedom of hobbled imagination to consume and to create . He thinks of your wily London merchant . Those merchants who , from their houses in this city on this island , buy and sell daily from all the world  --  wood and timber from the Baltic , fur from Muscovy , spices and silks from the East , fine glass from Venice , wines and oil from the sun-struck Mediterranean , ivory from Africa . Their daily trade . The Merchant ( as Cecil knows and imagines him , with a mixture of awe and contempt , the proper mixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carpetcoveredtable with scales and coins , pens and ink and papers , maps and charts . From all these , He constructs the world . Then he sends out for sale to these imaginary places his real English wool or cloth or corn or tin or brass . His ships follow the winds to and from all the raw edges of that world . Cargoes come and go , are lost and saved . Factors and agents arrive and depart . While he ( together with his little brood of clerks ) , wise orp300foolish , sits at the center and succeeds or fails . Sits still and yet is forever changing . So it is , in this new age , with Kings . Busyness is all . Except at the quiet still center . Where Kings ( merchants of kingdoms ) keep watch upon each other . Most often compelled to piece together friends and enemies out of words and numbers . Each invisible to the other . Yet each joined and linked to the other . Sometimes like lovers . Often like Jacob and his Angel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name .... From his patient father William Cecil , Lord Burghley , he has learned to love the secrets of papers . The same love and same secretswhich made it possible for Philip II of Spain to govern this world 's widest empire from an austere chamber not much larger than a monk 's cell . The first secret ( he tells himself ) is this : that it is not so much the words or numbers , though none can be ignoredand all of them must be embraced , as it is the invisible fire within them . The thing which from one imagination kindles another . Or put it another way . Call it the unseen power which serves to set imagination free to adventure as much as any soldier , sailor , or adventurer . As much and more than any common merchant . Oh , many a good man , a King or clerk to Kings , has been buried beneath cold papers as by a great settlement of snow . Weight becoming intolerable . Yet those same papers can be indescribablylight . Lighter than feathers blown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . His own feathers . From which wings are to be made which will permit him to fly free out of the maze and over the tops of the walls and soaring high into blue astonished sky . He is too educated , too ironical and skeptical , to allow himself such thoughts for long . Must wake from them . But , still , he cannotdeny he warms body and soul by the white fires of these letters . Can not imagine living without them . These letters of Kings and clerks are  --  if truth be told ; which it will not be ; for he must , by custom , sigh and complain at the tedious , heavy-lidded burdens of his vocation , else too many would envy him too much  --  are all the wine and poetry and music , all the joy he can wish for . Now that all love is lost . . . .  |p301Tonight  he is studying the letters he has at hand which passed between the Queen of England and the King of the Scots . And likewise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yearlong correspondence with King James . Which began almost at once , following the execution of the Earl of Essex . And which will continueuntil the matter of this Succession is finally settled . One way or the other . He considers this letter from the Queen to James in the fall of ' 86 . James was twenty years old at that time . He , Cecil , was twenty-three , already working with his father and for the Queen . Though without rank or office yet . Merely a clerk to the Queen 's great Clerk . Observing everything . Learning what he could know and , as well , learning to know what he could not know . Looking over his father 's shoulder . And King James in the fall of ' 86 ? Most surprising , he had managed to survive . On which no good gambler would have risked a wager . Friends and enemies , favorites and rivals , had come and gone . He had suffered dangers ( often ) and many humiliations . But he had come this far . Most important for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And still possessed of some power in those days . Still styled and recognized as Queen of the Scots by most of the world . In which sense he was her son and a Prince , but no King . She was Queen whether she remained a captive in England or no . And there was the possibility that she might marry again . If not to some English nobleman , then perhaps to some foreigner . At one time it seemed she might marry the hero Don Juan of Austria . To rule jointly . And there had been talk of Philip of Spain . And what if she were to have children by another husband ? And the Queen of Scots still had the allegiance of a powerfulfaction of Catholic lords in Scotland . Whose strength was more dangerous than ever before . For it was now uncertain , since they had ceased an open rebellion against the rights of James . Truth is , by ' 86 any number of these Catholic lords had become his allies in his effort to maintain some power to balance against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preach and to speak against him whenever his actions were disapproved of . Nor had been abashed I ) v his outrage against them . " I care not a turdp302for thy preaching ! " he had yelled . But neither that nor ( more serious ) the Black Acts passed by Parliament against the Kirk deterredor much discouraged their zeal . And there were the Protestantlords . Some who favored the Kirk , more who , for one reason and another ( and always chiefly for private greed and personal ambition ) were at odds with each other and with everyone else . And who had proved , many times , to be a threat against the King . Once , not long before , from August of ' 82 until June of ' 83 , James had been held captive by a group of these  --  the Lords Enterprisers . With the encouragement and connivance of the English . He had managed to revenge himself upon the leader of the Enterprisers , the Earl of Cowrie . But the others had fled to Englandand remained until they were needed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Scotland surrounded and supported by enemies . Who , fortunately , hated and envied each other more than they hated or envied him . So there he was , a paradoxical creature . On the one hand confident , even perhaps too confident of his abilities , because he had come through so much . Alone in the center of this ring of enemies and indifferent , often double-dealing friends , he had learned to keep his own counsel . And had learned , too , that he had a better mind , both by natural gifts and through rigorous training , than anyone he had ever known . More than anyone he had ever favored . For already , by ' 86 , there had been favorites whom the King had loved and honored  --  with extraordinary gifts of titles and offices and with the riches to go with them : Esme Stuart , James Stewart , and Patrick , Master of Gray . But his mind had always proved more than a match for these . As far as James could tell , he had no equals except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spirit were not so proud or kingly . At the same time that he rejoiced in his intelligence , flesh shrank , winced , quailed . He had lived all his life in constant fear of death by violence . ( With every good reason in Scotland . ) And he wore a padded doublet always to protect himself from the thrust of a knife . Which , so far , had not come . Cecil , frail and himself almost wholly dependent upon the power and agility of mind , can understand the contradictions ofp303the King . Cecil has a deep sympathy for the Scotsman , albeit a sympathy gently but firmly modified by the necessary sense of his own superior abilities . False humility being , in Cecil 's view , as crippling an illusion as rash , intemperate pride . No question the King has great intelligence , but Cecil 's sense of superiority derives from years of experience with the Queen . Her particular ways and means . There is neither question nor doubt in Cecil 's mind that the Queen is far more intelligent than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any other Prince , livingor dead , that he has known of . And even this is not a matter of natural gifts ; though hers are undeniable . Nor of her education ; though John Cheke and Roger Ascham were surely equal to George Buchanan and were , in all ways , kinder and more generouspedagogues . Nor could it be defined as the difference in the experience of the two . For , if anything , Elizabeth 's life had been as anxious and as dangerous as James 's . It is something else . Comprehensive understanding . Fire of imagination lifting her thoughts and her spirit above themselves . If the figure for it is fire , then he , Cecil , has been well-warmed by standing close . It is this warmth , this sharing of the fire of the Queen , which gives him a sense of superiority over the King of the Scots . He could tell the King a thing or two , if he should ever choose to do so , about this Queen whom he and his father have served . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few things . Beginning from the first of the careful , secret letters which he has been exchangingwith the King . Letters which are lightly disguised , nicely decorated with little ciphers and mildly enigmatic allusions . Such things as the King takes delight in . But nothing so gnarled or obscure that anyone else except a fool could be fooled for long . Does he imagine the King to be a kind of fool ? Even , as he has been called by some , the wisest fool in Christendom ? The simplicity of the codes and allusions reflects on Cecil and not on the King . Flatters the King by confirming his own superiority . Besides which it gratifies his restless spirit . Allowing him to dispose of these matters with deliberate speed and to be off and about his pleasures . Which he much prefers to the business of state.  |p304Aside  from these tropes of conspiracy , Cecil 's less obvious messageis delivered more like the Queen 's . Is more a matter of inference , of implication , of insinuation . That is : it is his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while meaning not somethingelse , but something more . So that the meaning of any letter is more than the sum of all its parts . The whole is intended to play directly upon the King 's hopes and fears . No hope without fear . No fearing without hoping also . Playing on these as a skilled musician will pick out music from the strings of a lute . For , as the proverb has it : There is no music without frets . Take this particular letter for instance . The letter he has only just read and tossed aside . Its purpose seems plain enough . To offer a brief , polite excuse for a delay she has taken in responding to his last letter . Which was , evidently , delivered to her by an ambassador . Also to thank him for his concern and apparent joy at her recent escape from the latest plot against her life , the BabingtonPlot . So named after its young , rich , and altogether foolish leader , Anthony Babington . The letter is dated only days after Babington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Undergoing the death on a specially built high gallows at St. Giles ' Fields . A few days after that , and only a week before a Queen 's Commission , newly created , will assemble at FotheringhayCastle to try the Queen of Scots . There is no direct mention of her . It seems to Cecil now , though he can not be any more certain than was the King then , that there is an obvious allusion to Queen Mary  --  " And yet when you shall hear all , you will wonder that one accounted wise will use such matter foolishly . " This must have aroused the King 's curiosity . Absence of any mention of the Queen of Scots or of the extraordinary Commissionand the extraordinary trial  --  things which James would have heard of from his own sources  --  served to force him to bring up the subject himself . If that subject were now to be raised between them , it would have to be his doing . It was as if Elizabeth did not consider her plans for the Queen of Scots to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James , it seemed that she was assuming that these things lay beyond the limits of his power . Whatever her motives might be , the King was left in an awk/ward position . And that ( Cecil believes ) would have been preciselythe Queen 's chief motive . To leave him doubtful , puzzling at her motives and all the while feeling an awkward dependency . Finding himself having to wait upon Elizabeth to say or do something before he could do either . What the King could not have imagined then was that the Queen must have already made up her mind not only to see to the trial of the Queen of Scots , but also to entertain seriously the possibility of killing her . Either by murder or execution . The Queen also allowed herself freedom from the first inception to the irrevocable execution , not to follow through with her own plan . Permitted herself to be able to change her mind . In any stratagem she sought not to arrive too soon at definitive endings . For she did not imagine that she could understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ineffable strangeness of it . The future was always wilderness . Terra Incognitaby definition . She employed gardeners ( Burghley , Walsingham , the preeminentexamples ) to manage her present affairs and to make plans and contingencies for an imaginable future . But it is not the imaginable future which concerns her . It is the wilderness of the unimaginable . It has ever been the characteristic quality of the Queen 's designs that when and if they come to pass , they must seem largely accidental , the results of impulse . That is to say , it should seem that she had never had any plan or design . And insofar as she has , in any given instance , been able to defer firm choices , there is a truth in that misperception . All of which has added value for her . For whenever an enemy does perceive the direction of one of her stratagems , he can never be sure that she will follow the logic of her own design . A true dissembler will honor ( or fear ) her as possibly the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been achieved by her duplicity . And so by placing the fate of the Queen of Scots in a shadowy future , she could choose to avoid any mention of that future to James . She used the occasion to play upon the deep-rooted fears of the King whose life had always been in danger since birth . She chose the seasoned hero 's easy shrug ( knowing that he would bep306offended by this ) and the unarguable statement that only the hand of God had saved her life . Ignoring , for the moment , the busy hands of Walsingham . And then stressing future danger , the dangers for him , likely to come from the Jesuits . That warningbeing one of the practical purposes of this letter . To see if she might frighten James into closing his kingdom to these priests . Or at the very least perhaps she could encourage the King 's suspicionsof his Catholic subjects and of France and Spain . Anythingwhich might inhibit their influence on him at just this time . Anything which might increase his sense of standing alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dependency on the English Queen . Only that summer , in June of ' 86 , had she finally awarded him a pension . Something which had been the subject of negotiations between them for years . Something which , in spite of the persuasionsof her Council , she had always managed to find reasons not to do . Looking back years later , Cecil can see that concerning payments to James ( or to other Scots ) there was a strong case eitherway . The Queen believed that Scots were not to be trusted at any price ; therefore that if they had to be bribed , it should always be at the least possible expense . Walsingham and Burghley , and most of the others of the Council , believed that a few thousandpounds , properly distributed , might allow them to control affairs in Scotland . The Queen considered that an unnecessary extravagance . For the most part she did not want to control the affairs of Scotland . Rather , she was content to encourage them to continue in their feuds and factions . So long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to spend much to seek their goodwill . But now she had at last settled a reasonably generous pension on King James . Less than he asked for , but more than he must have expected . This in return for what amounted to a defensive alliance . All that he had received concerning Succession was her ( private ) assurance that she would not prejudice any lawful claims he might have . As for the Succession nothing much has changed since then . Except that the Queen is older . And the King is no longer to be called young either . He is , however , a more attractive prospect to many Englishmen these days . Having maintained his governmentwell in that almost ungovernable country . And , favorites orp307no favorites , he has married a royal princess of Denmark and has produced heirs . If he should come to the English throne there need never be such an urgently confusing time as this again . He brings his own Succession with him . As recently as March of i6oi , soon after Essex ended his days on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling upon Sir Robert Cecil in his offices of the Duchy of Lancasteron the Strand . Chief of these were the Earl of Mar , Governorof Edinburgh Castle and Master of the Household for James , Edward Bruce , and David Foulis . With Essex gone and his factionbroken and dispersed , they had nowhere else to turn but to Cecil . So he agreed to begin a secret correspondence with King James . Taking the Queen 's letters as a model he wrote a lengthy letter to the King in which he suggested that though his service to his Queen was , as it should be , completely loyal , nevertheless " I perceivewhen that natural day shall come , wherein your feast may be lawfully proclaimed ( which I do wish may be long deferred ) such shall not be rejected , as lacking their wedding garment , who have not falsely or untimely wrought for future fortunes . " James was being reminded that even though the end of the Queen 's days is certain , his own accession to the throne of England , his " feast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawfully proclaimed . That word lawfully is coiled like a snake on the garden path . For there are certain quite serious legal problems , matters which might prohibit James from ruling in England . For , so long as the Queen lives , they can not be discussed or dealt with . Moreover , he continued , there was the matter that the Queen 's wishes must always be paramount . That if her mind were ever somehow to be set against her cousin , she might be " inclined ( if not resolved ) to cut off the natural branch and graft upon some wild stock . " A prospect which could not have pleased James . Finally , at the end of his letter , Cecil chose to offer some coun-sel : Your Majesty know that jealousy stirreth passion , even between father and son , that passions beget injuries between Princes , and that injuries either given or taken , in your case , breed alienation . To the first weakness in ller Majesty 's mind Ip308have already briefly said  --  That what was possible for art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successor in the mind of a possessor , hath been in the highest proportion labored by many against you . Out of this conclusion , that the eyes of Her Majesty 's suspicion could not be diverted from other practices , unless it were engraved in her heart that you were impatient of any further attention . It being well known , that as love is of all things subject to the greatest blindness , so fear once multiplied , neither trusteth profession nor heareth reason . To resort therefore to my just grounds , your best approach toward your greatest end , is by Your Majesty 's clear and temperate courses , to secure the heart of the Highest , to whose sex and quality nothing is so improper as needless expostulations , or overmuch curiosity in her own actions . The first , showing unquietness in your self , the second challenging some untimely interest in hers . All of which was sound advice . For as the Scots King had sent many agents to treat with influential men of Court and Council to make his case for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had overlooked the Queen 's sensitivity concerning this subject . She would not ( and will not ) permit it to be discussed . Unlessshe herself should choose to discuss it . It is a felony to write about the Succession or , for that matter , to be found in possession of any books or pamphlets dealing with it . There is no questionbut that she could be alienated from her cousin if he should prove to be too demanding . So Cecil had done the King a good service to caution him . Yet with his emphasis upon dangers , upon the doubtfulness of his cause , Cecil had heightened the King 's anxiety . For , from much study of the King 's words , his books and literary works and especiallyhis letters , Cecil took him to be a man made easily anxious about things yet to come . Because the King is hopeful he is also anxious . Like his father , Cecil believes that when all else may be in doubt , still papers can be trusted . For words , not spoken , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a lie ) can not lie . There is a golden essence of truth in them which can not be refined away to nothing . And ( he imagines ) this gold becomes purer with the passing of time.  |p309Take  the Queen 's letter of the fourth October of ' 86 again . Something she tells him . After shrugging off danger and casting blame upon the Jesuits , she presents herself as altogether unlike the King in wise magnanimity toward her own guilty , misled subjects : " For my part , I am sorrier that they cast away so many goodly gentlemen than that they sought my ruin . I thank God I have taken more sadness for some that are guilty of this murder than bearing them malice that sought my death . I protest it beforeGod . " It was well she did not also protest it before Walsinghamor Burghley . From whom she had demanded , in rage against these conspirators , that new and special torments be devised to dispatch them all as painfully as possible . Burghley had patiently explained to her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . But that if the full rigor of the sentence for treason were skillfully applied by the executioner the results would be at once sufficiently painful to the victims and terrifying to beholders . And , indeed , upon that high gallows , built so that a huge crowd could witness it well , when the first three conspiratorswere executed it was done that way . With all the agony the executioner could pluck from their bodies . The crowd was not pleased . Cried out against the cruelty of it . And so the prisoners killed on the next day were , by the Queen 's own command , more kindly treated . Allowed to hang and die before being drawn and quartered . James would have known this . Would have known her to be dissembling when she swore she had borne no malice against the conspirators who had planned to kill her . Do we not read our own faults directly into motives and actions of others ? Whatever she might say for herself , he was sure to assume the worst . Therefore why not say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . Well before the fall of ' 86 she knew him well enough . And had spoken aloud ( where it could be heard and was reported ) on the subject of his character . The occasion was the execution , in June of ' 8i , of the Earl of Morton , the formerRegent . Who had been a friend to England and Elizabeth and an enemy to the Queen of Scots . James , then only a lad of fourteen , had connived with his favorites , Esme Stuart and James Stewart , to arrest Morton at Council on the last day of December in 1580 . The very day before James had spent in the company ofp310old Morton hunting together . And at the end of that day the King declared to him  --  " Father , only you have reared me . And I will therefore defend you from all your enemies . " When the news was brought to Elizabeth that Morton had been executed in Edinburgh , she was outraged . " That false Scotch urchin ! " she cried out . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would protect him . And then the next day he had him seized and cut off his head . What must I look for from such a double-tongued scoundrel as this ? " Double-tongued scoundrel ! False Scotch urchin ! Had she changed her mind ? Not so much so that she was embarrassed to lie to him . And then to challenge him , if he dared , to disbelieve her . But ( Cecil wonders ) did she really find his duplicity reprehensible ? Only when it surprised her . As in the case of Morton . Whose life she might have had the power to save if she had known how threatened he was . But the Queen herself never doubted the efficacy of a lie to protect her crown or her kingdom . Therefore there was ( he thinks now ) a certain admiration in her anger : " What must I look for from such a double-tongued scoundrelas this ? " Cecil accepts the idea that the essential nature of a man is best revealed by his actions at times of danger . For the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lifetime ridden with fears and disappointments , must have been during those months of ' 86 . When the Queen first arranged the trial and condemnation of his mother , then contrived her execution in the Hall at Fotheringhay Castle . No question that the Queen outplayed him . If it can be taken as a kind of game between them . Once the Queen of Scots had been condemned to die , the Scots ( even those many who had opposed Mary ) came together against England and Elizabeth . James , waiting upon Elizabeth to act next , but seeming certain she would not dare to take the life of the Queen of Scots , found himself unpopular in his own kingdom . In November he sent one ambassador , Sir William Keith , to intercede for the Queen of Scots . Again in January he sent Sir Robert Melville and the Master of Gray . The latter , as Cecil knows , served Elizabeth as well as the King . As did many anotherScotsman . James was willing that his mother should be im/prisoned for life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she must not be executed . Cecil knows that the Queen did not take his arguments seriously or consider his pleas for long . For by two clear signs it was plain she could kill the Queen of Scots without much worry : first , that he did not threaten to break off the newly made alliancewith England or offer to do without his pension . Secondly , he coupled all his arguments for sparing the Queen of Scots with questions and proposals concerning the Succession . Elizabeth and her Council concluded that his pension and his hopes for the English throne outweighed everything else . Cecil nevertheless wonders how the Queen may have judged this . Whether James gained or lost value in her eyes . Certainly he lost some respect . But , even so , he can imagine a certain admirationby her for the young man who , ruthlessly tested , proved to be so ruthless himself . Willingness to sacrifice anything in his lust to be King of Britain was contemptible . Yet on the other hand . . . The notion that he so deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been a flattering one . But to this day Cecil does not know which judgment , contempt or admiration , is paramount in the Queen 's estimate . This should not surprise him , for he , too , is full of mixed feelings about the King . In the last week of January James wrote to Elizabeth once more to try to make a case for sparing the life of the Queen of Scots : A Madame ma tres chere Soeur &; Cousine la Reigne d'Angleterre Madame and Dearest Sister , If ye could have known what divers thoughts have agitated my mind , since my directing of William Keith unto you , for the soliciting of this matter , to which nature and honor so greatly and unfeignedly bind and oblige me ; if , I say , you knew what divers thoughts I have been in , and what just grief I had , weighing deeply the thing itself , if it should so proceed , as God forbid , what events might follow thereupon , what straits I would he driven unto , and amongst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects : If these things , I yet say again , were known to vou , than I doubt not but you would so far pityp312my case , as it would easily make you at the first to resolve your own best into it . I doubt greatly in what fashion to write in this purpose , for you have already taken so evil of my plainness , as I fear , if I shall persist in that course , you shall rather beexasperated to passions in reading the words , than by the plainness thereof be persuaded to one who , as soon as they be past , can usually weigh the reasons , then I can set them down . I have resolved in a few words and plain to give you my friendly and best advice , appealing to your ripest judgment to discern thereupon . Well . Was ever a reader more humbly warned ? This letter seems to begin not with the bowing of courtesy , but with the crawling which , they say , is the fashion in the Court of the Great Turk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter that follows . What thing , Madame , can greatlier touch me in honor , that both is a King and a Son , than my nearest neighbor , being in straightest friendship with me , shall put to death a free Sovereign Prince , and my natural Mother , alike in estate and sex to her that so uses her , albeit subject , I grant , to a harder fortune , and touching her nearly in proximity of blood . What law of God can permit , that justice shall strike upon them whom He 's appointed supreme dispensors of the same under Him ; whom He hath called Gods , and therefore subjected to the censure of none in earth ; whose anointing by God can not be defiled by man unrevenged by the Author thereof ; who being supreme and immediate lieutenants of God in heaven , can not therefore be judged by their equals on earth . What monstrous thing is it that Sovereign Princes themselves should be example-givers of the profaning of their own sacred diadems ? Then what should move you to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good faith I look not for at your hands ) honor or profit ? Honor were it to you to spare , when it is least looked for ? Honor were it to you ( which is not only my friendly advice , but earnest suit ) to make me and all other Princes in Europe eternally beholden unto you , in granting this my so reasonable request , and not ( appardon , I pray you , my free speaking ) to put Princes to straits of honor , where through your general reputation and universal ( almost ) misliking of you may dangerously peril both in honor and utility your person and estate . . . . And now , Madame , to conclude , I pray you to weigh these few arguments , that as ever I presumed of your nature , so the whole world may praise your subjects for their dutiful care for your preservation , and yourself for your princely pity ; the doing whereof only belongs unto you . Respect then , good Sister , this my first so long continued and so earnest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as may become your person to give , and as my loving and honest heart unto you merits to receive . But in case any do vaunt themselves to know further of my mind in this matter than my ambassadors do , who indeed are fully acquainted therewith , I pray you not to take me to be a chameleon , but by the contrary take them to be malicious imposters , as surely they are . And thus praying you heartily to excuse my rude and longsome letter , I commit you , Madame and dearest Sister , to the blessed protection of the Most High . Who can give you grace so to resolve in this matter , as may be most honorable for you and most acceptable to Him . From my palace of Holyroodhouse , the twenty-sixth day of January , 1586-87 . Your most loving and affectionate Brother and Cousin , JAMES R.What interests Cecil now is not the arguments James mounted in hope of saving his mother 's life . If indeed he really feared for her life . Cecil thinks that James misunderstood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that profound misunderstandingwhich gives his pleading letters now such a perfunctorycharacter . As if they were matters of form only . Some have thought so . The Queen herself may have thought so , may think so still . She has implied as much . But , as Cecil begins to understand the man , James simply never imagined that his mother would 1w put to death . Therefore his letters were written , and his arguments , such as they were , were made so that he might be entitled to feel that he had helped the Queen to make up herp314own mind . Laughable ? Hardly ; for it was the stock-in-trade of Burghley ( and others ) for all those many years . And it remains the tactic of Sir Robert Cecil . With a difference . That difference is that more and more she does not appreciate any kind of explicitpersuasion . Rather , in the same sense that she insists more upon the rituals of flattery than ever she did as a younger woman , so she prefers to imagine that she has arrived at all decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , counseling them , rather than the reverse . Perhaps it was always so . If so , then James erred badly if he hoped to gain favor by a demonstration of his powers of persuasion . Even if he had succeeded , he would have been recognized by her not as an equal Prince , but rather as a young man with the makings of an excellent clerk . No matter . Whatever his motives , the case failed . And that was that . Words could not save the Queen of Scots . More to the point for Cecil and for England are his views of kingship . The most he could have gained from presenting his philosophy of kingship , in the letter was her weary annoyance at his presumption to seek to teach her what it means to be a Prince . No one , except a rebel or a fool , would deny that Kings are indeedGod 's viceroys on earth . Beyond that claim , however , are many subjects for debate . Our Queen might well agree with James in theory that Kings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not subject to any kind of judgment . Even by their equals . She might think that a pretty theory . But she knows better . She will vigorously defend her prerogative and privileges . But she prefers the limits of her power to be more cloudy than clear . With Parliament , indeed with her own Council , it has been a business of give and take . And she has taken care not to challengethe Laws of her own kingdom . Since that time there is more evidence to go by . Poet and scholar , James has written two books on this subject  --  The Trew Law of Free Monarchies ( 1598 ) and Basilikon Doron ( 1599 ) . When Cecil first read these books , Essex was still alive and the chief supporter of the claims of King James . Therefore Cecil studied them for clues to the character of a man who might be an enemy to him . Recently he has examined them with morep315sympathy . Seeking to know the man through his theories . Yet also bearing in mind that these were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost ungovernable lords and by a Kirk which has strenuously resisted his view that the King 's authorityis inherently ecclesiastical as well as secular . They were also written against other works . Especially the celebrated De Juri Regni apud Scotos of ' 79 . Written by George Buchanan , his old teacher whom he had feared and hated to Buchanan 's dying day . What troubled James most about Buchanan 's book was the argument that it is the right of a people to resist tyranny . As , indeed , the Scots had done with both his grandmother the Regent and his mother the Queen . And as some had tried to do with him . By the time he came to write his own books on the subject , Buchanan was dead and he had had the old man 's work banned and burned . Yet it had been popular in Europe and in Scotland . It needed to be answered . And so he did so . Basing his argument upon the special divinity which is conferred upon Kings . " Kings are called Gods by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " because they sit upon God His throne in the earth , and have the court of their administration to give unto Him . " And in Basilikon Doron , addressed to his son and heir Prince Henry as a guide to kingship , he says the same thing with more emphasis . " Therefore ( my Son ) first of all things learn to know and love God , to whom ye have a double obligation ; first for that he made you a man ; and next , for that he made you a little God to sit on his Throne , and to rule over other men . Remember that this glisteringworldly glory of Kings is given them by God to teach them . . . so to glister and shine before their people , in all works of sanctification and righteousness , that their persons as bright lamps of godliness and virtue , may , going in and out before their people , give light to all their steps . " These books are King James 's letters to the world . A portrait of himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time being , it is sufficient to know that James has assumed that a literal divinity is conferred with a crown . Which may make his studies of Scripture and of history , and especially of the intricately snarled chronicles of Scotland , more than a lit/tle baffling to him . But which may also serve to make the laws and customs of the English difficult for him to fathom . If and when that should be a practical matter . The last chance for James to act on his mother 's behalf came in that January . While his ambassadors were there in London yet another ( timely ) conspiracy against the English Queen was uncoveredby Burghley and Walsingham . She wrote to James about this . Briefly , but with a clear warning of what was to come . You may see whether I keep the serpent that poisons me , when they confess to have reward . By saving of her life they would have had mine . Do I not make myself a goodly prey for every wretch to devour ? Transfigure yourself into my state , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life and reject the care of murder , and shun all baits that may untie our amities . And let all men know that Princes know best their own laws . . . . To my very good brother and cousin , the King of Scots . Transfigure yourself into my state . Ah . Exactly his hope , his dream , his intention . And yet exactly what he was incapable of doing . Still , that invitation may have inspired him . For it allowed him , if he were foolish enough , to misinterpret it as doubt and weakness on her part . Her next letter to him came in February within days of the death of the Queen of Scots . It is a letter which seems , still , to be weighing and sifting choices she must make . Nothing in it could have seemed final . Which was just as well . Seeing as Elizabeth would claim that the death of the Queen of Scots had never been intended by her . Your commissioners tell me that I may trust her in the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and allies promise she will no more seek my ruin . . . . Suppose you I am so mad to trust my life in another 's hand and send it out of my own ? . . . Let your Councilors , for your honor , discharge their duty so much to you as to declare the absurdity of such an offer . And , for my part , I do assure myself too much of your wisdom , as , though like a most natural good son you charge them to seek all means they could devise with wit or judgment to save her life.  |p317Yet  I can not , nor do not , allege any fault to you of these persuasions . For I take it that you will remember , that advice or desires ought ever to agree with the surety of the party sent to honor of the sender . Which , when both you weigh , I doubt not but that your wisdom will excuse my need , and wait my necessity , and not accuse me either of malice or of hate . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Queen of Scots to the care of a neutral Prince as an absurdity concocted by his ambassadors on their own . Nothing seems certain here . Exceptthat she will not consider letting the Queen of Scots leave England . By the time James received this letter the Queen of Scots was dead . And here beginneth a kind of stage play . World for the stage . The value of which performance , to the Queen and to all England , depended on ambiguity . The question was not one of truth but of belief . Queen must act as if she truly believed her own accounting . As if she expected others to believe it as well . Her first public reaction to the news of Mary 's death was of astonishment and grief . The Court was at Greenwich in that secondweek of February when the news from Fotheringhay arrived . It was Burghley himself who concluded that it should be kept from the Queen . And so he ordered it to be ... . Cecil knows his father would not have dared to do such a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen . So that she could have an adequate occasion to be surprised . And then to react to the news in such a way as to confirm and strengthen her story . There was no other reason to try to hide the news . And there could be no hiding of it . On the ninth of Februarythe Queen , in the company of her Maids of Honor , came back to the Palace from an afternoon of riding in the Park to hear on the breeze from upriver the bells of London . " Why are the bells ringing out so merrily ? " she asked . " Because of the death of the Queen of Scots . " First astonishment , then grief . Finally rage at her Council . Burghley banished from Court . Walsingham sick . Her secretary , Mr. William Davison , clapped into the Tower . For handing on the warrant for the Queen of Scots ' execution . Which , indeed ,  |p318Queen  Elizabeth had signed . But which , she insisted , she had no intention of acting upon . She promptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you knew ( though not felt ) the extreme dolor that overwhelms my mind for that miserable accident which ( far contrary to my meaning ) has befallen . I have now sent Sir Robert Carey , this kinsman of mine , whom , ere now , it has pleased you to favor , to instruct you truly of that which is too irksome for my pen to tell you . I beseech you , that as God and many more know how innocent I am in this case , so you will believe me , that if I had bid aught , I would have bid by it . I am not so base-minded that fear of any living creature or Prince should make me afraid to do that which were just ; or done so to deny the same . I am not of so base a lineage , nor carry so vile a mind . But as not to disguise fits most a King , so will I never dissemble my actions , but cause them to show even as I meant them . Thus assuring yourself of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , if I meant it , I would never lay it upon others ' shoulders , no more will I damnify myself that thought it not . The circumstances it may please you to learn from this bearer . And , for my part , think you have not in the world a more loving kinswoman , nor a more dear friend , than myself , nor any that will watch more carefully to preserve you and your estate . And who shall seek otherwise to persuade you , judge them to be more partial to others than to you . And thus in haste , I leave off troubling you , beseeching God to send you a long reign . Your most assured loving Sister and Cousin , ELIZABETH R.The audacity dazzles Cecil . Anything less would have implied some sense of guilt . She accepts none . It was all , simply , a miserableaccident . . . . After an appropriate delay , in early March , back came reply of King James : Madame and dearest sister , By your letter and bearer , Robert Carey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you unhappy fact . As , on thep319one part , considering your rank and sex , consanguinity and long-professed goodwill to the defunct , together with your many and solemn attestations of your innocency , I dare not wrong you so far as not to judge honorable your unspotted part therein ; so , on the other side , I wish your honorable behavior in all times hereafter may fully persuade the whole world of the same . And , as for my part , I look that you will give me at this time such a full satisfaction , in all respects , as shall be a means to strengthen and unite this isle , establish and maintain the true religion , and oblige me to be , as I was before , your most lovingJAMES R.How easy it proved to be ! He allowed himself only one sly littlemoment  --  the hope that the rest of the world ( depending , of course , upon her good behavior ) might come to believe her as much as he did . Otherwise it is a bill for payment due . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strengthen and unite this isle , establish and maintain the true religion , " and to win back his love and goodwill . The success of this request may be judged by the plain truth that it is still unresolved these sixteen years later . There was no dancing in Scotland when the Queen of Scots was put to death . How James received the news was in question . Some said he took it with a strict , impassive face . Others reported that he became ill and took to his bed . Still others said that he could scarcely contain his joy . " Now I am sole King ! " he cried out . He put on purple for mourning , but declined to respond to the challenge of his nobility . Who said that armor was the only proper mourning dress for the dead Queen . There was much talk of revenge and punishment . And nothing came of it . The Queen and everyone else of importance were all too busy preparing against the enormous power of Spain to trouble themselvesmuch about Scotland or its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Cadiz , Sir Francis Drake caused the delay of the Armada . But by late spring of ' 88 , it was certain that the Armada would soon sail and that at last the great Enterprise Against England would begin . It was necessary , then , to secure herself against danger fromp320Scotland . And for the Queen to counteract Spanish influence and any offers which they had made to win over James . The occasion of this letter was twofold : to acknowledge the return of her most recent ambassador to him ( she had sent her close kinsman , Henry Carey , Lord Hunsdon ) and the news that , with some Englishaid from the castle at Carlisle , King James had been able to capture and destroy the castle of Lochmaben in Dumfriesshire . Which had been in the hands of Catholic rebels for a long time . To our good brother and cousin the King of Scotland : My pen , dear brother , hath remained so long dry that I suppose it would hardly have taken ink again , but , mollified by the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to execute at Lochmaben , together with the large assurance that your words have given to some of my ministers , which all cloth make me ready to drink most willingly a draft of the River Lethe . . . . She announces herself as ready to forgive and forget . And emphatically ( again ) insists upon her innocence in the death of the Queen of Scots . God , the cherisher of all hearts ever so have misericord of my soul as my innocency in that matter deserveth , and no otherwise ; which invocation were too dangerous for a guilty conscience ; as I have commanded the bearer more at large to tell you . And for your part , my dear brother , think , and that with most truth , that , if I find you willing to embrace it , you shall find me the carefulest Prince of your quiet government , ready to assist you with force , with treasure , counsel , or any thing you shall have need of , as in honor you can require , or upon cause you shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for never yet were they stained , neither will I make you the first on whom I shall bestow untruth , which God will not suffer me live unto . I have millions of thanks to render you , that so frankly told Carey such offers as were made you , which I doubt not but you shall ever have cause to rejoice that you refuse . For where they mean to weaken your surest friend , so be you assured they intended to subject you and yours . For you see how they deal even with their own in all countries lesser than their one ; andp321therefore God , for your best , I assure myself , will not let you fall into such a danger , under the cloak , for all that , of harming other and advancing you . But I hope you will take Ulysses ' wax to save you from such sirens . It were most honorable for you , if it so please you , to let them know that you never sent for their horse , though some of your lords ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too saucy in this ) made believe you consented to their message , which they themselves desired your pardon for . This will make them fear you more hereafter , and make them afraid to attempt you to weaken your assured friend . If I deserve not your amity , persecute me as your foe ; but , being yours , use me like a Prince who feareth none but God . Your most assured loving sister and cousin , ELIZABETH R.So long as the Spanish threat continued that summer , so did the letters . Professing friendship and goodwill . And all based upon serious doubts about James . Cecil is familiar with Lord Hunsdon 's memorandum on the King . Which the Queen took to heart .

" In truth , weather and winds saved James as they had saved England . For the Spanish ships were blown clear around Scotland , except for a few shipwrecked along the coast . To the King , as to many , even in England , the fate of the Armada must have seemed to be a greater disaster to Spain than it truly was . But Elizabeth knew Philip of Spain well enough to be sure that so long as he had any resources he would not hesitate spending them to conquer England . And that now that he had suffered a disastrous humiliation , there could be no negotiations for peace . That he possessed the power to continue to make war for as long as he chose to . Thus , even as bonfires roared and bells rang and rang , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly warriors , all scoured armor and grandiose plans , even as she smiled and smiled , acknowledging the praise and prayers of her people , her inmost heart must have been as heavy and cold as a stone . Even his father imagined ( at first ) that a victory or , anyway , a successful conclusion to this war was now possible . God had puffed His great cheeks and made the wind and blown away the Papist Armada . Surely God would continue to bless and favor His people . The Queen believed only what had happened . But knew what was sure to happen next . Knowing , as if the truth of it had been suddenly lit as lightning can fill a night with a daylight brightness , that only her death could change anything . Knowing that even the death of Philip could not bring peace . Far from it . His heirs would be compelled , out of Spanish honor , to honor his vision . Knowing , then , in the sad wisdom of the heart , that this great victory settled nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That more English blood would be spilled than all the wine flowing in celebration from the conduits of London and Westminster . That , sooner and later , more bodies by far than all these shouting crowds would die or be crippled by it . Knowing that they would come to hate her . That all this energy would turn against her , and , indeed , against themselves , as war continued . With its little rosary of victories and defeats . With its unimagin/able cost in blood and treasure . Knowing that the next time they will ring the bells and fire the bonfires and dance in the streets with this much clamor and joy will be precisely then  --  at the death of her . So , even as she smiled and smiled , she was , in a true sense , celebratingher own death . Was witness to what it would be like here after she died . Smiling and smiling and smiling . Like a skull . And it is all there in her letter to James . Though it is put in the terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this tyrannical proud and brainsick attempt will be the beginning , though not the end , of the ruin of that King ... . James may have ascribed the tone of her letter to weariness and doubt . Even to fear . But never mind his misapprehension . More to the point : he , who seems to have spent most of his energyfor most of his days in dreaming of the future and waiting for it to arrive , seems not to have been able to imagine what that future would be . One of the things it meant was that the exchange of letters between them continued . Regularly or irregularly according to events . Sometimes warmly . As on the occasion of the King 's marriage to young Anne of Denmark , a marriage of which the Queen was most approving . And in the meanwhile , let it content you to give me so much right as to assure yourself that no witness there of so princely a pact shall wish it more success , nor greater lasting joy than myself ... . Letters of congratulation and joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one and another of his remarkableescapes from ( real and contrived ) dangers . It amuses Cecil that even in her official letters she could not resist a chance to apply her usual pressure . Urging him to act more vigorously against his Catholic subjects . Forever pushing him toward the exercise of justice . And thereby , as Cecil sees it , committing himself more openly to the Protestant cause . Or ,  |p325more  aptly , to her cause . Making himself ever more dependent on her . Nor could she ever seem to relax her pedagogical manner . She would somehow ( to what end ? ) teach him how to be a King . And so her letters , whether of approval or disapproval , almost alwayscontain instruction of one kind or another . Slacking of due correction engenders bold minds for new crimes . And if my counsels had all as well been followed as they were truly meant , your subjects had now better known their King , and you had no more need of further justice . Advance not such as hang their hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold can corrupt , think not your gifts can assure . Who once have made shipwreck of their country , let them enjoy it .

God is witness that I malice none , but for your security is the only care of my writing . I desire no blood , but God save yours . Only this my long experience teacheth me : when a King neglects himself , who will make them enemies for him ? A long-rooted malady , falling to many relapses , argues , by reason , that the body is so corrupt that it may be patched but never sound . When great infections light on many , it almost poisoneth the whole country . It were better , therefore , that the greater part were kept solid though some infected perish . Preserve the better part and let example fear the follower . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strings to one bow , they may shoot strong , but never straight . And if you suppose that Princes ' causes be veiled so covertly that no intelligence can betray them , deceive not yourself . We old foxes can find shifts to save ourselves from others ' malice and can come by the knowledge of the greatest secret , especially if it touches our free hold.  |p326Let  not shades deceive you , which may take away best substance from you , when they can turn but into dust or smoke . An upright demeanor bears ever more poise than all disguised shows of good can do . Remember that a bird of the air , if no other instrument , to an honest King shall stand instead of many feigned practices , to utter aught may any wise touch him . Assure yourself that no greater peril can ever befall you , nor any King else , than to take for payment evil account ; for they deride such , and make their prey of their neglect . There is no Prince alive , but if he show fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he be out of minority . I confess that divers be the affections of many men , some to one , some to another ; but my rule of trust shall never fail me , when it is grounded , not on the sands of every man 's humor , but on the steady rock of approved fact . Judgment of others was not necessary ( after she had endured some time as a Queen ) to build her confidence . But the flattery of others was and is demanded . Even James had to be prepared to be a flatterer at the appropriatetimes . And except for some flourishes of a high and weighty style , James has found few occasions which have allowed him to addressthe Queen in a pedagogical fashion . A few aphorisms scatteredhere and there . Like wild flowers growing among weeds . But for the most part the King has always been on the defensive . Most often forced into that posture by the Queen . Who is not only forever lecturing him upon the subject of kingship , but also demanding explanations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters with apology . Apologizing not only for things done and left undone , but also for his words . Words which he must claim to have been well meant , but somehow misinterpreted . Over the years the King has often found himself craving the pardon of the Queen . In the epistolary quarrels between them when , teeth gritted in fixed smiles of politeness , they have attempted to settle the issue of frays between their subjects , especiallyalong the ragged Borders . Or have sought justice , askingp327that some malefactor or other be returned to face trial . As if justicewere a contest between them . When you gamble with the Queen ( Cecil well knows ) , it is not necessary that she should win every hand to be happy , but when she does win a hand she must be paid in full then and there . There is no waiting for the end of the game to reckon up winnings . It may have been greatly satisfactory to the Queen to know , even before the execution of the Queen of Scots , that nothing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones ) seemed to be more important to James than his pension and his hopes for the Succession . The latter impinges upon the former . To this extent . Very often , so frequently as to belie any other explanationthan as a pattern of deliberate forgetfulness , payment of James 's annuity has been late . Treaty or no treaty , he has been kept waiting and often required to remind her of the promised payment . And then , upon the receipt of it , must thank her profusely . Which manages to multiply his expense of gratitude for the original promise by precisely the number of payments that must be made . In short , it is as if he must renegotiate his treaty for each payment . She knows that he can not do without his pension . He would be absurdly destitute without it . It is reported that he has not one full set of plate to his name and must borrow from his nobilityfor any large feasts or banquets . Moreover , he can not accept , openly at least , gifts from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , like the poor cousin that he is , withoutanger . At the least sign of impatience he has been chastised . At each ( rare ) display of anger he has been treated to a taste of her anger and to the nearest thing to a box on the ears or a slap in the face that can be conveyed by words on paper . For a loving friend anxious to reassure the King and to assist him to shore up the power of his sovereignty , the Queen has displayeda remarkable capacity for discovering all kinds of enemies in his own kingdom  --  the Catholic lords , the preachers of the Kirk , his very Councilors . If he has truly believed her , he must have imagined himself to lie ringed on all sides by hostile enemies. licit whether or not he believed her , nevertheless doubtsp328were ' planted and continually cultivated . She fed fuel to his fears . Not the least of those fears was ( and is still ) the fear of her , of her habitual ambiguity , of her evidently passionate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of her rage . Which , from time to time , exploded . As if to justify his worst apprehensions . I doubt whether shame or sorrow have had the upper hand when I read your last lines to me . Who , of judgment deemed me not simple , could suppose that any answers you have writ me should satisfy , nay , enter into the opinion of anyone not void of four senses , leaving out the first . When the first blast of a strange unused and seldom-heard-of sound had pierced my ears , I supposed that flying fame , who with swift quills often passes with the worst , had brought report of some untruth ; but when too many records in your open parliament were witnesses of such pronounced words , not more to my disgrace than to your dishonor , who did forget that ( above all other regard ) a Prince 's word ought utter naught of any , much less of a King , than such as to which truth might say " Amen . " Besides your neglecting all care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might light upon you ) you have chosen so unseemly a theme to charge your only careful friend withal , of such matter ( were you not amazed of all senses ) could not have been expected at your hands ; of such imagined untruths as never were once thought of in our time . I do wonder what evil spirits have possessed you , to set forth such infamous devices , void of any show of truth . I am sorry that you have so willfully fallen from your best stay , and will needs throw yourself into the whirlpool of bottomless discredit . Was the haste so great to hye to such oprobry , as that you would pronounce a never-thought-of action afore you had but asked the question of her that best could tell it ? I see well that we two be of very different natures , for I vow to God I would not corrupt my tongue with an unverified , uncertain report of the greatest foe I have , much less could I distract my best-deserving friend with a spot so foul as scarcely may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts from your subjects upon no better ground than this quagmire , which to pass you scarcely may , without the slipp329of your own disgrace ? Shall embassies be sent to foreign Princes laden with instructions of your rashly advised charge ? I assure you the travail of your words shall pass the boundaries of many lands , with an imputation of such levity , as when the true sunshine of my sincere dealing and extraordinary care ever for your safety and honor shall overshade too far the dim and misty clouds of false invectives . I never yet loved you so little as not to moan your infamous dealings which you are in mind .. . . Bethink you of such dealings and set your labor upon such mends as best may . Though not right , yet salve some piece of this overslip . And be assured , that you deal with such a King as will bear no wrongs and endure no infamy . The examples have been so lately seen as they can hardly be forgotten , of a far mightier and potenter Prince than many that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amends I may or will ignore such indignities . We have sent this bearer , Bowes , whom you may safely credit , to signify such particularities as fits not a letter 's talk . And so I recommend you to a better mind and more advised conclusions . Praying God to guide you for your best and to deliver you from sinister advice . . . . Your more readier sister than yourself path done , for that is fit , ELIZABETH R.Poor James . Forever having to make " large amends . " Apologizing , explaining , defending words and actions . And at those rare times when the shoe was on the other foot , when it was he who was in the right and ( it seemed ) she who must find a way to explain or apologize , he was treated to yet other forms of her indefatigable guile . Silence was one kind of reply . A month or two or more , followed by a letter which made apology merely for silence and delay , explaining these away as the result of too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his earlier complaint . Leaving it for him to try to return to the subject of it . If he dared to . Another tack of hers : to answer him with perfect innocence , as if confused by any complaints that he might possibly have . It is very welcome to its , and at all times shall be , that you ,  |p330invited  as you write by our example and by the obligations of true kindness , do use plainness in opening unto us any thing that lies in your heart . But why at this time the same is used as a means to obtain the curing of some wound ( as your letter doth insinuate ) we'do not well understand . For in the examination of all our actions toward you , we do not find that any thing hath passed from us that may be construed for a wound , except the same language of plainness , which yourself do well affirm to be an undisseverable companion of true friendship , but do change habit when it cometh from us and not from others ; with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessed , and that our frank and real dealing hath ( out of your own apprehension ) strucken deeper than we intended , or bred any other conceipt in your mind than in his own nature the sincere and mutual expressing of each other 's thoughts should do between friends , we will from henceforth be more reserved ; as being one who , neither in deed nor in word , either have or mean to violate our former just and affectionate profession . Leaving the King regretting that he complained to her about anything in the first place . It could be a subject fit for laughter . How a wonderfully clever Queen was able to control her young cousin ( and all his neighboringnorthern kingdom ) without the use of force of arms . And without fulfilling the usual requirements of large bribes and pensions . Indeed without spending more than the most frugal sums . And how ? Chiefly by and through words . Her letters . No small victory in that mastery over a King who is poet and scholar . Defeating him , then , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is the much larger matter of the Succession . Which was the chief , if not the only , reason that her crafty game with him had so long succeeded . For , first to last , he would sacrifice almost anything to achieve that ambition . The more it had been dangled and deferred , the more his hunger for it increased . So that , as he grew into maturity and wisdom in other things , the dream of the Succession grew stronger also , from desire to lust to ( by now ) obsession . Meaning that if he were willing to offer up his mother 's life for the sake of his dream , then by now his will/ingness to sacrifice had increased that much more . In a sense Elizabeth 's letters , her often arrogant pedagogy , her long-winded and emphatic advice upon any and all subjects that interested her , whether or not these in any way truly concerned her , the ice of her sarcasm and the fury of her unbaited temper , all these things tested and proved to her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have proved something to him also . That if a man can learn to swallow pride and to live with shame , then he is possessedof greater power to realize his hopes than many another who values the world 's estimate . That is , James had learned from the Queen the truth that every good servant ( even Cecil himself ) must come to know  --  the heady , liberating power of outwardand visible humility . Learned that shame and humiliation , which James had known since childhood , can not only be borne , but also can sometimes lead to more profit than honor and pride . Many a proud man , among those who dazzle the world into admiration , has died shamefully to preserve and defend . . . what ? The very pride and honor he lost with his life . King James is a student of Scripture and much taken with the Sermon on the Mount . It may be that he has learned how ( literally ) the meek may inherit a goodly portion of the earth . If this is true , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair with him . For she has taught him what he must know to be a King of England . Others were willing , like the Queen 's grandfather , to fight to possess the crown ; that is , to wager their own lives , and the lives of many others , to seize it if they could . But who among them , if any , could wait for it humbly ? Who would be willing to live for it , upon the hope of it only ? Cecil doubts that she would , even in anger or out of perversity , name any other successor than James . Provided that James continues to play the role she assigned to him . The moment of final decision for the Queen , as Cecil sees it , came after the Essex rebellion . It was then that she could have denied him his hopes . And with justice , too . In April of i6oi she sent a lengthy letter to James . To be carried by special ambassadors , who had come to England evidentlyto plead for Essex 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known concerning the King 's friendship withp332Essex . And to learn what they could about the King 's right at the Succession . In particular they came to propose that James might be awarded some lands in England which had once belonged to his grandmother , Margaret , Countess of Lennox . Thinking thereby to circumvent the English law which forbade the throne to anyone not in possession of land in England and ( at the same time ) forbade a foreigner to own estates in England . Thinking that if he were awarded his grandmother 's estates , he could claim to be de facto an Englishman . But thinking ( truly ) that the Queen 's response to this request would give a strong clue concerning the Succession . Of the Essex rebellion she said little and , as usual , was both casual and indirect . Yet also pedagogical . And where your ambassadors have congratulated us from you on the occasion of our happy prevention of the late treasonable attempts , the suppression whereof , praised be God , fell out to be only the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that office from you , and requite you with this good wish , that thelike may never befall you or at least be as easily passed over ; that being utterly extinguished in twelve hours which was in hatching divers years . Surely , Cecil thinks , there is an implication which will not be lost on the King , that she knows more about this plot than she will choose to say . Surely there is a message in the ease with which the plot fell to pieces . Much of the rest of the letter , all but the final paragraph , is concerned with matters of business between them . Finally she comes to treat the problem of the Countess of Lennox 's lands : Lastly , touching your desire to have some lands where the title remains yet undecided , we will speak shortly to you , that we found of all things most strange , considering how well ye have discerned our disposition therein heretofore that such demand should be renewed , since yourself can not be ignorant that some consequences which depend thereupon hath made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . All which considered , seeing you profess so clear a desire to remove all scruples , we hope to hear no more of any of these matters , which are so unworthy ofp333our dispute , who have and do resolve to nourish and perform all princely correspondency , which can be by nothing more disgraced than when our common adversaries shall see , that when new causes rise not , old and bypassed scruples are revived. . . . we hope to hear no more of any of these matters . . . So much for the King of Scotland and his latest stratagem to assure himself of the Succession . Her letter must have chilled him well . As if written in ice . And yet . . . . His ambassadors returned to Scotland with other news and letters . Among them the first letter to the King from Sir Robert Cecil . It was the King who initiated the correspondence between them , once he had some sense of certainty about Cecil . He wrote to Cecil as soon as his special ambassadors , Mr. Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to Scotland and reported to the King what had been understood between them in Cecil 's offices of the Duchy of Lancaster in the old Savoy . The King ( Cecil knew this as soon as they did ) had sent them with instructions to warn Cecil to support the claims of the King or be prepared to suffer the consequences . The King was not dreaming that his ambassadors would arrive to find Essex executed and all his faction scattered . Finding no one stronger than Mr. Secretary . They saw that threats and bluster would not do . Cecil might not promise the Succession to James . Clearly no one in England could do that and be believed . But just as clearly ( it seemed to them ) no one could now succeed to the throne in the face of Cecil 's opposition . The King could never peacefully come to the throne if Cecil were prepared to oppose him . With Essex gone  --  and who could know , for certain , how much Cecil knew of the dealings between Essex and the King of Scots ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first letter from James , with its quaint little code  --  3o for the King , io for Cecil , 3 for Lord Henry Howard . I am most heartily glad that io hath now at last made choice of two so fit and confident ministers with whom he has been honorably plain in the affairs of 3o , assuring o that 30 puts more confidence in them , according to the large and long proof that hep334hath had of them than in any other that follows him , like as 10 is most beholden unto them for the honorable report that they have made of him to 30 , to whom they have , upon the peril of their credit , given full assurance of the sincerity of io ... . Something more than the end of Essex 's power was required before Cecil could seriously begin to support James . Convenient that Cecil 's cousin , spymaster Anthony Bacon , had died at the same time . Bacon , long in correspondence with James , could have caused difficulty . Would have made any kind of correspondence with James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King 's first words serve to stress , it was essential to have trustworthy messengers . There had been earlier opportunities for Cecil to begin to treat with the King . But he could never trust those who suggested it . Cecil has not managed to prevail by trusting other men with his fate . It is rather because he feels sure that the King trusts his ambassadors . And because 30 can not have the occasion to speak face to face with io , that , out of his own mouth , he may give him full assurance of his thankful acceptance of his plain and honorable dealing , he therefore prays io to accept of his long approved and trusty 3 , both as a surety of his thankfulness and his constant love to him in all times hereafter , as also to be a sure and secret interpreter betwixt 30 and io in the opening of their minds to one another ; whom 10 hath the better cause to like and to trust , since , long before this time , 3 dealt very earnestly with 30 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a dealer betwixt them . Whereupon 30 was contented that 3 should deal between Essex and 10 , for a conformity betwixt them , as well as for 30 in his own time , but that 10 mistrusted and aspiring mind of Essex , 30 can not but commend , taking it for a sure sign that 10 would never allow a subject should climb to so high a place , and that he should ever be in thrall to a subject that hath been from childhood trained up in the service of a free Prince .. . . That they should likewise make use of Lord Henry Howard ( 3 ) suited Cecil well . Lord Henry has been corresponding with the King for years now . And before that he was in correspondence with the Queen of Scots . And it was once the rumorp335that he had hopes to marry her . Brother to the Duke of Norfolk ( who was executed for treason ) Lord Henry has been continuallyin and out of difficulties . Mostly he has been out of favor with the Queen . His nephew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Philip Sidney was a godson of King Philip II of Spain ) was implicated in the Throckmorton Plot . Finally was convicted of treason and sentenced to death . Lord Henry himself is Catholic , but with the understanding , if not the approval , of the Queen . He is obliged to Cecil who managed his release from Fleet Prison so that he could travel to Italy . The Queen has long given evidence of disliking and distrusting him . And James ? Well . Here is a member of the great and ancient Howard family . A family which has been for generations close to the crown , kin to the crown , and mostly out of favor . Except , of course , for the Lord Admiral , the aging Earl of Nottingham , who is much favored by the Queen . The King has something to offer to Lord Henry and to all the Howards  --  hope of restoration to former glory . Thus Lord Henry 's support has some value to the King , and Henry may be trusted . He has nowhere else to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the two men . Lord Henry is a scholar , also . Indeed he has lectured at Cambridge and might have embraced the life of a scholar if it were not so much beneath him . There are advantages for Cecil , too . Lord Henry is beholden to him . On several counts . And will continue to be so . Lacking the Queen 's ear and her trust , he is one of the least likely men alive to betray Cecil . And whatever the future may bring , come James of Scotland or some other , Cecil will need allies . The Howards are allies at this time . And it pleases Cecil to be in a position of simple , unequivocal superiorityover this man . That kind of satisfaction is wonderfully satisfying . Lifts flagging spirits like nothing else . Except perhaps a just reward for good and honorable service rendered . But justice is so rare in this bruised and bitter world as to be discounted altogether . Revenge is not so rare . Can even be arranged . But much care must be exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the satisfactory occasion presents itself , only a saint or a fool would deny himself the pleasure of it . Moreover Cecil would argue ,  |p336since  the other kind of justice  --  freely granted appreciation for work done well  --  is quite as rare in this world as any unicorn free of the threads of tapestry , then , good sir or madame , the rough and ready repayment of wounds and repair of injuries by acts of revenge is the only form of justice most of us will experience on this side of heaven . Or hell , as the case may be . That Lord Henry Howard is a vengeful man is another source of comfort to Cecil . He can depend upon him for more than if hunger for virtue and zeal for righteousness were the whips that drove him . And yet 30 doth protest , upon his conscience and honor , that Essex never had any dealing with him which was not most honorable . As for his misbehavior there , it belongs not to 30 to judge of it , for although 30 loved him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to embrace his quarrels , but to accept of every man according to his deserts ... . As to the Earl of Essex . Lord Henry had been his friend and had supported him . Though he was not directly involved in the rising . One can not question the word of a King . Therefore , this King stands firmly on the strength of his word ( " Arid yet 30 doth protest , upon his conscience and honor , that Essex never had any dealing with him which was not most honorable . . . " ) in places which are the most ambiguous . Cecil knows what went on between Essex and the King . And the King must know that he knows . Else he is a fool . Nevertheless insists upon the royal lie . WhyP To give Cecil occasion to say something concerning Essex . The King , introducingEssex by name into his letter , is challenging Cecil to make his views known . Allowing Cecil the opportunity to defend himself against the story that he destroyed Essex . And , having lied himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cecil knew he must be very careful . With Essex gone , the factionfell to pieces , and only the dispensable parties were executed . Cecil saved Southampton . Who remains in the Tower , waiting for the Queen to die . If James comes to the throne , it will be his privilege to pardon Southampton . Cecil has saved Southampton for him  --  and as insurance for himself.  |p337In  the vulgar and popular world , ballads and satires and libels still appear . Cecil is blamed , together with Ralegh and Cobham , for the downfall of Essex . And the King knows that . Would Cecil , lawyerlike , argue a case in his own behalf ? Would he denounce Essex as unworthy of the favor of the King ? When he wrote his reply to James , he gave a single paragraph to answer the challenge . And now I must leave the quick and resort to the dead , of whom I would to God I could speak the best , seeing by yourself his name was remembered , which is shortly this :  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as could have given me security that his thoughts and mine should have been no further distant than the disproportion of our fortunes , I should condemn my judgment to have willingly intruded myself into such an opposition . For who know not that have lived in Israel , that such were the mutual affections of our tender years , and so many reciprocal benefits interchanged in our growing fortunes , as besides the rules of my own poor discretion , which taught me how perilous it was for Secretary Cecil to have a bitter feud with an Earl Marshal of England , a Favorite , a Nobleman of eminent parts , and a Councilor , all things else in the composition of my mind did still concur on my part to make me desirous of his favor . The tone is sad and wise . Regret for what came to pass , but no regrets for his own part in it . Indeed , no admission ( or denial ) that he played any part except that of a dutiful , obedient servant to the Queen . The subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open it again . Kings can not , finally , love a rebel . Even one who acts in their behalf . Best that Essex should be dead , to be honored or despised at the King 's pleasure , than to be alive and well to be feared and forever mistrusted . . . . His servant 's snores , like the snores of an old dog , from the trundle bed , these are the nearest things in Cecil 's life . And the fitful swaying of candle flames , scent of melting wax . Shadows  --  his humpbacked body cast huge on the wall by these flames . As if the wall were aflame . As if he were ( lancing in those hugep338flames . Silently screaming there . Or as if the flames were like light in moving water . Light and water , light and flame . Dizzying . A feeling of the instant before falling . Feeling of what it must be like to drown . In the sea slowly sinking , end over end , a rag doll , while far above light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music he can not hear , can not imagine . As if a moment before sleeping and dreaming ... . Rises abruptly to move to pitcher and ewer . Pour water , clear and cold . Drawn from one of the nine springs that feed the water , by lead pipes , to this palace . Nine clear springs . And in the larger chambers there are rows of pipes and casks . From which the water may be drawn , according to the separate springs , or blended together . Sometimes he thinks it is not warmth of this brick palace that brings the Queen here , as she claims , but the water . Which is good . Which is cool . Which is very sweet . Splashes his face with cold water . Chill wakening him from the edge of a vision he could not bear . Himself in a nest of flames , screaming and screaming without making a sound . Pauses a moment , as he dries his face with a linen napkin , hearing dimly , beyond his servant 's snoring , the rise and fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imagines how it will be in an hour or two . When wrapped and mu 11 ed against it , his servant holding a covered lantern , he moves across cobbled courtyards and finds the way to his own comfortable chambers . Where there will be his great , curtained , four-posted bed waiting warmly . Where there will be fire in the fireplace . Where he can lie in the comfort of clean sheets and the warmth of heavy blankets . And stare at the watery shapes of the fire beyond the curtains . Ready to sleep . Heavy-lidded , but unwilling to let go for fear there will be no returning . Never mind . He now returns to his table and papers . The King must be encouraged ( if and when he shall come to power ) to understand he is deeply beholden to those who have worked to make it possible . And chief among those must be , when and if that time arrives , Sir Robert Cecil.  |p339Cecil  has warned him of the folly of seeking any kind of popularityin England . Further I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to say this much to Your Majesty : that although it be a common rule with many rising Princes to refuse no address or request , yet you will find it in your case , that a choice election of a few in the present will be of more use than the general acclamation of many . . . . Whosoever therefore persuades Your Majesty that it is necessary for you to be busy to prepare the vulgar beforehand , little understands the state of this question . Neither shall Your Majesty find my words untrue in this one thing more  --  that if the extraordinary persons ( though small in number ) whom neither base nor haughty humors draw to love you , should find themselves to be used as a motive to increase the public party ( it being ordinary for the vulgar to follow better example , without any such precedent insinuation ) , surely the minds of men of spirit and value are so compounded , the addition that is sought of the greater part will be the privation of the other . To which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement : No . Ye need not think that I am so evil acquainted with the histories of all ages and nations that I am ignorant of what a rotten reed popularity is to lean upon , as some in your country have very dearly bought the experience thereof of late . I am no usurper . It is for them to play the Absalom . Yea , God is my witness that I shall ever eschew to give the Queen any just cause of jealousy through my behavior . And , besides that , I ever did hold this maxim , that a few great spirits were the ordinary instruments and second causes that made the world to be ruled according to their temperature . . . But yet it is true that the hearts of the people are not to be rejected , but not to be compassed by any particular insinuation with every one of them , which would breed greater jealousy in the Queen than good success with them . But good government at home , firm amity with the Queen , and a loving care in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these are the only three steps whereby I think to mount upon the hearts of the people . . . .  |p340It  is Cecil 's belief that Englishmen have concluded that whatevercomes to pass following the death of the Queen must be accomplishedas peacefully as possible . Where a generation or so ago they might have been willing to fight to prove any claim to the crown believing , perhaps , that blood must be spilled to consecratethe wearing of a crown , they would now prefer a peacefulsolution more than the rights of any claimant . All the more reason for the choice of James , outspoken defender of peace and concord . Cecil , too , wants peace . And not only because , as a pensioner of Spain , he is charged to find a way to a peace . But he has learned that James would prefer to establish peace himself . For , when asked for his views concerning peace with Spain now , beforeit was in his authority to do more than offer advice , the King was strongly against it . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the English crown : When I have advisedly considered and deeply looked into this matter , I can not surely but think that the time being weighed , and the present state of things , such a peace at this time must be greatly prejudicial , first to the state of religion in general , secondly to the state , both in religion and policy of this isle in special , and lastly most perilous for my just claim in particular . Amongst many , three principal gates for procuring these forenamed mischiefs by this peace would apparently be opened . First , free trade betwixt these nations would so soundly conciliate and extinguish all former rancors as it would so more be thought odious for an Englishman to dispute upon a Spanish title ; secondly , the King of Spain would thereby have occasion , by his agents of all sorts , laden with golden arguments , who would have free access to corrupt the minds of all corruptible men for the advancement of his ambitious and most unjust pretenses , besides the settling of sure means for intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seminary priests , and all that rabble wherewith England is already too much infected , would then resort there in such swarms as the caterpillars or flies did in Egypt , no man anymore abhorring them , since the Spanish practices was the greatest crime that ever they were attainted of , which now by this peace will utterly be forgotten.  |p341Not  content to warn Cecil of the dangers of peace with Spain , the King felt free to offer criticism of the English treatment of the Catholics . As , of all things , too lenient .. . And now , since I am upon this subject , let the proofs you have had of my loving confidence in you plead for an excuse for my plainness , if I freely show you that I greatly wonder from whence it can proceed that not only great flocks of Jesuits and priests dare both to resort and remain in England , but so proudly do use their functions through all parts of England without any controlment or punishment these many years past . It is true that for the remedy thereof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not me for longing to hear of the exemplary enforcement thereof . I know it may be thought that I have the like beam in my own eye , but alas it is a far more barbarous and stiff-necked people that I rule over . St. George surely rides upon a forwardly riding horse , where I am daily burst in daunting a wild unruly colt . And I protest in God 's presence the daily increase that I hear of Papery in England and the proud vauntery that the Papists make daily there of their power , their increase , and their combined faction , that none shall enter to be King there but by their permission , this , their bragging , I say , is the cause that moves me , in the zeal of my religion , and in the natural love that I owe to England , to break forth in this digression , and to forewarn you of these apparent evils ... . The King 's apparent zeal was intended to test Cecil . There was no way to avoid the issue . But perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vouchsafeth to acquaint me with the inward temper of your mind , in matter of religion , I take for an unspeakable favor , for what can give more rest to an honest man than to foresee the continued blessing of living under a religious Prince . . . . For the matter of priests , I will also clearly deliver Your Majesty my mind . I condemn their doctrine , I detest their conversation , and I foresee the peril which the exercise of their function may bring to this island , only I confess that I shrink to see them die by dozens when ( at the last gasp ) they come so near loyalty , only because I remember that mine own voice ,  |p342amongst  others , to the law ( for their death ) in Parliament , was led by no other principle than that they were absolute seducers of the people from temporal obedience , and confident persuaders to rebellion , and , which is more , because that law had a retrospective to all priests made twenty years before . But contrariwise for that generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ordinary merchandise of any thing than of the blood and crowns of Princes , I am so far from any compassion , as I rather look to receive commandment from you to abstain than prosecute . But of this matter there is enough said , for , though I confess that neither your commandment , nor the greatest power on earth , could make me alter my pace , for private consideration , in the matter of blood , against my conscience ( if it were otherwise than I tell you ) , yet being , as I have showed it to be , as well against the priest as the Jesuit , I will presume only for Your Majesty 's satisfaction ( against the prejudice of rumor ) to let you know particularly how Her Majesty resolves to proceed in this matter . . . . It has been Cecil 's policy to play upon the factions among the Catholics , working to increase division between the seminary priests and the Jesuits . He knows that the King 's policy is similar . If Cecil were ignorant of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flatterer than Councilor , he might have answered the King in kind . Cecil has now concluded that the King 's promises to Catholics , offering toleration in return for support of his claims to the throne , are very thin . That he may need an excuse to break them . But given the excuse , he will not be bound long by any previous understandings . Cecil has been determined to be assured , even as he has been seeking to reassure the King , that the Succession of James can be peaceful . It can be done , he believes , provided that the King understandsthe role that he must play . The Queen has spent years in educating and preparing him . Now it falls to her Principal Secretary to bring that schooling to completion . Thus in a sense he has been making negotiations on behalf of the Queen . Though forced to do so in secrecy and without her knowledge or approval . An arrangement whereby he will be able to preside overp343the transfer of the sovereignty of this kingdom to the King of Scotland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England . And for himself . He has no intention of laboring long and hard , and at risk , without excellent prospects of earning favor . If the King has hopes of improving his rank and power in the world , well , so does Cecil . This King has proved himself to be generous to a fault . Especiallygenerous to those whom he favors . Yet often generous to anyone in need . Even among his enemies . As if he somehow innocentlybelieved that ill will can be converted to goodwill by generosity . He has done this with only the most limited of means . And no doubt one of the strongest appeals of the Successionis the prospect that he will have at last the means to be more generous than ever before . But the King has nevertheless seldom favored those to whom he has owed much . Especially those to whom his debts have been greatest . It is for certain that the King does not like to feel beholden to others . Cecil hopes to be well rewarded . If he brings the King to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity . King must need Cecil even more to be King of England than he does to become so . Meantime the Scotsman must be constantly encouraged . It is best that he should be allowed to maintain some burning coals of doubt until the moment when the crown is placed upon his head . Fortunately the Queen has long since planted doubts in him that will never wholly disappear . And as it is true that your constant advised and uninfected flock , greater I assure Your Majesty , now than my pen shall need to express , in power and place , are so devoted to the present , as all the earth can not change their duty or divide their affections from her person , to whom their only allegiance is due ( until God Almighty shall otherwise dispose of her ) , so vouchsafe me in this to be your oracle , that when that day ( so grievous to us ) shall happen which is the tribute of all mortal creatures , your ship shall be steered into the right harbor , without cross of wave or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . .  |p344All  of James 's experiences at sea have been unfortunate . Going and coming , to fetch his bride from Denmark , he encountered the most terrible weather . It has been learned by careful investigation , including judicious torture , that a coven of Scots witches was responsible for the winds and waves that nearly took his life and treated his innards so roughly that he cared very little , at the time , whether he lost his life or not . Cecil could not have selected a more meaningful comparison to impress upon the King the need for a skilled pilot . No question , either , but that he must offer appropriate flattery . Flattery being the most expeditious form of encouragement . And it must be taken as such by the King . But nevertheless it must be satisfactory . Only fools permit themselves to depend on the complimentsof others to ease the heavy burden of awareness of their faults . Only a fool could seriously desire to have weaknesses named strength , deformities called beauty , folly identified as wisdom . Deformity has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is willing to concede , have been beneficial . And one of these is a point concerning flattery . Point is that every man has need of it , even himself . Needs it like food and water , love and righteousness . Every man hungers and thirsts for the recognition which flattery confers . And all the more so as we feel the less worthy of it . It is a ritual due to superiors . Like doffing and holding your hat in the presence of betters . Like bowing . Like kneeling . Its grudging absence connotes either ignorant misunderstanding of rank and degree or persistence of a proud and unruly spirit . The King of Scotland is known to be a kind of coward . He greatly fears the possibility of tumult and violence anywhere around him . Would the King , then , be pleased to be called courageous ? Flattery coming from a fool and addressed to another fool is what it would be to proclaim King James of Scotland to be a creature of heroic resolution . Lies might be sweet to hear . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's flaws is , finally , insulting . Insolent . And tends to confirm the truth of the weakness that it seeks to disguise . There 's nothing to be done to change the King of Scotland from a coward to a hero . What has been done has been to name his firstborn son Princep345Henry as the new Hercules of the age , as the Isaac of Scotland and the militant Kirk , as , likewise , heir to the ancient King Arthur of Britain . As heir to James he is , therefore , heir also to his claims to England 's throne . The King has offered the magical possibility that all of his flaws would become virtues , that his weakness would be transformedinto strength in the next generation . He may hope and believe this himself . Like any father with his child . Meantime , Cecil judges the King has lived with his weaknesseslong enough to prove that he can bear them . The art of flattering that man who 's not a fool is to speak not to his weakness , nor , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to address yourself to his . . . vanity . For in a true sense every man 's vanity is his greatest weakness . It is the one weaknesshe has not learned to live with or to do without . Cecil will never stoop to salute the King for his regal courage or bearing . He will honor him for spirit , for the enviable power and admirable quickness of his mind . And this succeeds precisely because the King 's mind is just good enough to justify vanity . When I beheld this latest letter of yours , so full of wisdom , greatness , and moderation it gave my mind a double consolation ... . For what could be more absurd for men of common sense than still to pester a Prince ( whose time is precious ) with so many petty particulars , if we had not tried your habit of patience ; and what ought men of any understanding to be more afraid of than to offer so much counsel to a Prince of so much understanding , if it were not true that we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratitude ... . Cecil found that an exchange of compliments was not unlike a game of tennis . For James could be superlative in his praise also : My dearest 1o , I am ashamed that I can yet by no other means witness my thankfulness for your daily so honorable , judicious , and painful labors for the furtherance of my greatest hopes than by bare ink and paper , and that your travails of so great worth and inestimable value should be repaid with so poor recompense . Butp346the best excuse is that these papers are but witnesses of that treasure of gratitude which by your good deserts is daily nourished in my heart . . . . All of which is encouraging to Cecil . Even though all promises glitter like morning dew at first light , they all too often vanish , like the dew , into empty air . And as the proverb has it : Great men are giants in their problemsand pigmies in performance . To be indispensable he needs to appeal directly to the King 's fears . Fear can become such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be confused without it . Cecil believes that James would be suspicious if there were nothing to be afraid of . It is part of Cecil 's function to offer the King some dangers which , together , by superior intelligence and cunning , they can overcome . The King takes pleasure in the untying and unraveling of plots and conspiracies . Well trained by his father and by Walsingham also , Cecil has proved himself expert at the discovery of plots . The King knows this well . Knows , too , that there are at all times plots against the state and the person of the sovereign . That is , plots are always there to be found by looking for them . Most can be safely ignored until such time as exposure may have value . As , for example , to remind the populace of the Prince 's mortality and to bring them in unity to surround the sovereign with their love . Or the exposure of a plot can silence or break apart some faction which has become dangerous . As Throckmorton 's Plot and Babington'sscattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous malcontents . A plot can be uncovered which serves to remove an enemy within the state , as Sir Henry Howard'sbrother , the Duke , was hopelessly entangled in the Ridolfi Plot of ' 72 and died for it . Plots can be found which serve the purpose of cautioning the Prince . Such was Essex 's discovery of the plot of Dr. Lopez to kill the Queen . Unfortunately for Essex , the Queen was unimpressed , believing the plot was fabricated by the Earl . Guilty or innocent , Lopez died the traitor 's death ( perhapsbecause the Queen was more concerned then to teach Essex a lesson than to save the life of a foreigner ) , and the Earl gained almost nothing by it . In the absence of wars , which can be won or lost , or open re/bellion , which can succeed or fail , it will be necessary , if and when the King shall succeed , that he has occasions to demonstratehis wise capacity for awarding justice and for tempering justice with mercy . There will be no difficulty in finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimes in England . Except perhaps that the practice of witchcraft is not so prevalent here as in Scotland . Though many gentlemen and ladies of the Court will have their stars cast by some doctor skilled in astrology , it has been a long time since there has been much concern about witchcraft . Perhaps the coming of James will serve to revive some interest in the craft of witches . If he should come in peace , and if there are ample occasions for him to demonstrate his judicial wisdom , nevertheless he will also need to show ability to overcome enemies . Even in peace . . . perhaps especially in conditions of peace where enemies are disguised if not unknown , there must be a triumph over some opposition . And at the very least places must be made for the King 's men . Both Englishmen and the Scots he will have to bring with him . Some new places can be created , to be sure . And places and offices will multiply , also , in the lesser courts to be formed around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places will have to be made for new men . Surely men holding office now under the Queen will have to be promptly removed . This King will want to have such changes appear to be more a matter of justice than of royal whimsy . Cecil 's task has been made easier for him . That there are enemiesin places of power has long been a theme of the correspondenceof Lord Henry Howard with the King . It is his nature to suspect , to seek , and to find enemies . His misfortunes have confirmed the continual whispering ( of himself to himself ) that it is more the malice of others than bad luck that has shaped his fortune . At this time it is fortunate to be joined in alliance with Lord Henry . Not only because King James trusts him ; not only becauseLord Henry 's correspondence with the King antedates his own by years ; and not only because friendship with Lord Henry helps ease away the difficulties of Cecil 's having once been in opposition to Essex ; but , beyond all these things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have to contend against his malice . Lord Henry has enemies he has cited ( again and again ) as enemiesto the King and to his Succession . Chief are Sir Walter Ralegh ; Henry Brooke , eleventh Lord Cobham ; Lord Grey of Wilton ; and Henry Percy , thirteenth Earl of Northumberland . Considering these . Ralegh has been a partner to Cecil in business ventures , and a friend . But no matter how he might bestir himself on Ralegh 's behalf , should he wish to do so , there is nothing much Cecil can do to save Ralegh 's place . Lord Henry will insist on that . It will be part of the King 's reward to Lord Henry , then . Moreover , quite aside from any slanders and libels spread against him , Ralegh is an offense to King James . He 's strong for war and the King for peace . Ralegh has ridiculed witchcraft and the power of witches ; and he has been named as a skeptic in religion . Even an atheist . The King loathes the custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; Ralegh has dealt in tobaccoat great profit . The rumor was that at the execution of Essex , Ralegh smoked his pipe and insultingly blew smoke on Essex as he passed on his way to the scaffold . It was widely repeated that gentlemen there asked Ralegh to withdraw from the scene . That he went to the White Tower ( still puffing his pipe ) and watched the execution ( looking triumphantly pleased ) from a window there . That afterward he scorned Essex'sdeath , saying he died like a calf and a coward . Cecil knows how rumors are spread and what can be cultivatedfrom them . Surely the King 's mind is firmly made up against him . What 's to say ? Ralegh has been blessed with good fortune under the Queen . Most of those who matter believe his good fortune to be undeserved . Of all the great men at Court he is now the most unpopular . In honesty , Cecil would have to advise the King that dismissal of Ralegh from his offices will win approval . Ralegh has become perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like many a man before him , and live quietly in the country . There are worse things.  |p349As  for friendship . When choice arrives between friendship and survival , then farewell friendship . Ralegh knows that . Has written about it . Would sell Cecil 's hide if he had to . Something troubles Cecil , however . Though Ralegh is arrogant enough to deceive himself in many things , he is neither stupid nor foolish . Cecil can not permit himself the luxury of imagining that Ralegh understands his own precarious position less clearly than Cecil does . He may know less than Cecil . But Cecil does not know how much Ralegh understands . Or what he plans to do . He does know that Ralegh dismissed overtures made to him by the Duke of Lennox , acting for the King , to reach an arrangement with James . Ralegh 's rejection of Lennox has been construed by Lord Henry and taken by King James as strong evidence that he is committed to some other claimant . More fool he , if that is true . As for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , Cobham Hall , has parks and gardens said to be the equal of any in all England except for Nonsuch and Hampton Court and for Cecil 's own Theobalds . Ah , easy for Cobham Hall to be fine to behold when all of Kent is one great garden . Where England 's finest apples are . And pears and plums and cherries . Where the strawberries are fattest and the raspberries are sweeter than you can believe . Where the best hob nuts are gathered . And where the hops for making our beer are grown . Cobham 's father was his father 's friend . Was Lord Chamberlainand Privy Councilor . And this his son is Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and Knight of the Garter . Laden with honors . Yet , like the Howards and the Percys , the Brookes have had their share of traitors . Have been luckier in keeping heads and bodies together . Cobham 's father ( like Cecil 's ) once supported the Lady Jane Grey , then turned to Mary Tudor just in time . In Wyatt 's Rebellion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sir Thomas Wyatt , now betraying him and for Queen Mary . Queen Mary pardoned him on Good Friday . At the time of the Ridolfi Plot he was clapped in the Tower but soonp350released . Most said he was spared on account of his friendship with Burghley . Others took him to be a secret agent , albeit a noble one , for Cecil . Used to entrap Lord Henry Howard 's brother . Treason and double dealing are in the blood of the Brookes . Now the son , since ' 97 Lord Cobham of Kent . Overbearing , proud , vain , violent , stupid , and dangerous . Elizabeth was his sister ( bless her , pray for her soul ) and he hated her marriage to Cecil . Now that she is gone , Cecil is free to hate him and all that family . Well . Thanks to the malice of Lord Henry Howard and the follies of Lord Cobham , Cecil need not do anything to guarantee Cobham 's future fall . Lord Grey ? A man of the war party , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from James . Also he is Southampton 's mortal enemy . When James frees Southampton , as he surely will , then Lord Grey is finished . The inveterate hatred of Lord Henry for these men , together with the disposition of the King to fear and distrust them , makes it awkward . In many things Cecil has worked inwardly with Cobham and Ralegh . The three have been sometimes taken to be a faction , an unholy trinity in the eyes of their enemies . It was against them particularly that Essex claimed his rising was directed . If that cause did not bring crowds out into the streets to support it , never mind . The charge remains . So it has become essential for Cecil to disassociate himself from the other two  --  in the King 's mind at least ; never you mind about the sweaty rabble who shift with the slightest turning of the wind . Lord Henry 's adamant hatred for the two is good help . And it is comforting to know that he can convince the King that there is no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labors of Sir Robert Cecil . The King can hardly be expected to allow himself to be enthralled by a swarm of doubts about Cecil even as he must trust his future to him . No , what he will do , as all men must do , is exercise his freedom obliquely ( like a man dancing in chains ) , choosing to suspend some doubts and to transfer others upon the shoulders of other candidates . All of which simply means this : that the King wants to believep351in Cecil and wants to believe Cecil has disassociated himself from all pernicious influences . But Cecil must meet the King halfway . To do this , however , calls for sleight of hand . For he can not arouse any suspicions in Ralegh or Cobham . If anything , he has to ease whatever inclinationthey might have to suspect Cecil . Can do so by binding himself more firmly in outward and visible signs of friendship and goodwill . Which he has done . And yet he has to be careful not to rouse doubts in the King . His answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announce his duplicity to the King and to invite him to share in it . For this I do profess in the presence of Him that knoweth and searcheth all men 's hearts , that if I did not sometimes cast a stone into the mouths of these gaping crabs , when they are in their prodigal humor of discourses , they would not stick to confess daily how contrary it is to their nature to resolve to be under your sovereignty ; though they confess ( Ralegh especially ) that natural policy forces them to keep on foot such a trade against the great day of mart . In all which light and sudden humors of his , though I do no way check him , because he shall not think I reject his freedom or affection , but always use contestation with him , that I neither had nor ever would contemplate future idea , nor ever hoped for more than justice in time of change , yet , under pretext of extraordinary care of his well-doing , I have seemed to dissuade him from engaging himself too far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assume for me or my present intentions . Let me therefore presume thus far upon Your Majesty 's favor  --  that whatsoever he shall take upon himself to say for me , upon any new humor of kindness , whereof sometimes he will be replete ( upon the receipt of private benefits ) , you will no more believe it ( if it come in other shape ) be it ever so much in my commendation , than that his own conscience thought it needful for him to undertake . . . . In a sense this is most flattering to the King . Whether he believesit or not is less important than that he should conclude that Cecil is truly a duplicitous nuui . Which will confirm thep352King in his own feeling that he is quicker and more clever than even Cecil . Therefore need not fear him too much . As for Cecil , is he troubled in conscience by this ? Not much . For a man 's first obligation is to himself and to his estate . As his father once put it in writing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man too far with thy credit or estate , for it is mere folly for a man to enthrall himself to his friend further than , if just cause be offered , he would not dare to become otherwise his enemy . " Be free to be a just enemy , then . Especially when that friend insists upon the same freedom . For Cecil has seen what Ralegh wrote to his own son on the same subject : " Take especial care that thou never trust any friend or servant with any matter that may endanger thine estate ; for so shalt thou make thyself a bondslave to him that thou trustest and leave thyself always to his mercy . " Northumberland represents another problem . . . . He is one of the ancient nobility  --  indeed , by the intricacies of blood kinship , he happens to stand eighth in line to the Succession . Not so close as to be feared , but near enough to the throne to be listened to . A leader among loyal Papists , he is not known to be a Papist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has spent much of his life living not in the Percys ' North Country , but in the mansion at St. Andrew 's Hill , Blackfriars . His studies and experiments have earned him the nickname of the Wizard Earl . Reasons for the antagonism of Lord Henry toward Northumberlandare clear to Cecil . Both come from Catholic families of ancient nobility . Both families have suffered at the hands of the Queen 's justice . Northumberland 's uncle , Thomas Percy , was beheaded in ' 71 for his part in the Northern Rising . His father , the twelfth Earl , was three times in the Tower , and the third time died ( mysteriously ) by his own hand . It could be said that Lord Henry and Northumberland had equal disadvantages . But Northumberland has fared better . At the time of the Armada he was trusted with a command . Lord Henry was not . He has enjoyedenough of the Queen 's favor to maintain his family 's wealth . For years Lord Henry had to depend on a modestp353pension . Lord Henry 's enemies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership than trust Lord Henry . Northumberland also has been carrying on a correspondence with James . Which James has passed on , together with copies of his replies , to Cecil . This to demonstrate to Cecil that he will keep no secrets from him . Cecil knows better . But takes the King 's gesture to mean that the problem of Northumberland will fall to Cecil . There are sundry reasons the King fears Northumberland . The Percys have been foes of Scotland for as long as memory allows . Wealth and pride of the Percys must be an offense to the penuriousKing . For Northumberland can endure comfortably without the favor of the King . He can not rightly be ignored , but he cannotbe rewarded as easily as others , either . Then there is the matterof his marriage . For a time it was truly believed that Northumberlandmight marry the Lady Arabella Stuart . If he had , then James 's chances for Succession would have been greatly diminished . As it happens , he married the sister of the Earl of Essex instead . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And finally , not least of their differences , the directionstheir scholarly minds have taken  --  the King dedicated to theology and poetry ; the Earl toward the new philosophy  --  have made it a certainty that they could never be friends . And yet Cecil believes it is the letters of Northumberland which have troubled the King most . True , the King has professed irritation with Lord Henry 's letters , calling them " Asiatic and endless volumes . " But he relishes them . Enjoys the richly decorativeflattery , as if words were gilded plasterwork . Delights in the malice , the embroidered malevolence of gossip . Is pleased by the pedantry and learning , which are much like his own . Northumberland'sletters are different . In both style and substance . While dutiful , their tone is nevertheless more nearly that of an equal than that of any of the other letters the King has received from England . Direct , plain , and straightforward . The two main points that are most in question among us , and that I think I may give Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether after Her Majesty 's life your right will be yielded to you peaceably , without blows ornot ? the other , whether it be likely Your Majesty before yourtime will attempt to hasten it by force . As for the matter of your claim after Her Majesty , I hearalmost none that call it in question . . . Surely James must have ( inwardly ) started , as if reaching for fruit in a basket , he had taken hold of a snake . In such plain words must rise up from the dead his tutor , Buchanan and the stern Regents of his childhood , the great Lords who made him weep for fear and shame and laughed to do so . Failure of imagination on both sides . For surely poor Northumberland must believe this King , close to his own age and eager to be the King of England , would preferplain speaking from the nobility . Cecil sees at once that Northumberland 's counsel , blunt as it is , is truthful in premises and wise in conclusions . Moreover , it has this much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkwardness of having to say certain things to the King . Take , for instance , Northumberland 's judicious reassurance to the King that the ancient nobility of England can be relied on not to stand against his Succession . Northumberland arrives at his assessment of the English nobility as a part of his persuasion against any idea of the King 's to seize the crown by force . If the weary time of Her Majesty can not be long in the course of life  --  for it is certain that young bodies may die , but old bodies must die out of necessity  --  would the hazards of war then countervale the time that may be ( but perhaps ) gained ? For the dividing of our forces into so many different businesses , soon they would be recalled together when it should come to the question of so essential a point . It is true that of the nobility , some are not satisfied , the gentility displeased , the men of war muttering , and the popularity is grieved . Yet let it be considered from whence these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillars to adventure so great an action on . In theory the King should be reassured to know that he needp355not consider the choice of war . It should give him strength to resist the persuasions of those Scots who believe otherwise . Essentially , it is the same advice which Cecil has offered  --  be calm and be patient and the kingdom can be yours . And the King , with his picture of himself as one among the ( blessed ) few peacemakers in this fallen world , should be pleased to understand that peace is the most reasonable , most expeditious policy . And yet , much as he hates and fears war , the King does not wish to be denied the choice of it . Wishes peace to be considered his gift to England . Peace-loving or not , he does not wish to be told that it would not be possible for him to win the crown by force . Besides which Northumberland has already , in this same letter , carried truth too far for his own good . Reminding the King that if things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be seftled on the field of battle . Besides , Your Majesty is not ignorant that if any of these courses be discovered afoot , that your own subjects , being so prone in their disposition to lay violent hands upon their Prince , how easy it would be to find instruments to take you away , which all of your servants could not hinder nor help ; and if taken away , either by fortune of war or otherwise , in the minority of your son , he being but a child would hardly be invested ever with his right in this kingdom , others having once taken possession over his head ... . Good Lord deliver us ! If the thing which Northumberland desired most was to frighten the King out of his wits , he could not have chosen a more efficient means . Rekindling the memories of his past , remindinghim of the ever-dangerous present and awakening fear for the future . A fear not only for himself but for his heirs . Woe unto the messenger who bears harsh tidings . Northumberlandcannot have conceived that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being a man without much fear himself , Northumberland can not conceive of the tactics of the truly fearful . Can not know how fearfulness engenders in the spirit so much self-contempt , self-disgust , as to be unbearable . Insofar as truth threatens his hopes , the King can not bear to hear of it . Thus , ironically , his ears sealed , as if to the music ofp356the sirens , the King missed much of the practical wisdom Northumberlandhad to offer . The nobility are unsatisfied that place of honor are not given them , so soon as they become judges of their own desert ; that offices of trust are not laid in their hands to manage as they are wont ; that Her Majesty is parsimonious and slow to relieve their wants , which from their own prodigalities they burdened themselves withal . They repine that the state value them not at that rate they prize themselves worthy of ; neither is there many in this rank , for some are pleased , and others are not capable ; so Your Majesty may discern these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want , and self-conceipt , hot discontents soon born and soon dying in themselves , stings not bitter enough to lead them on to so great a hazard , when their considerations of blood shall tell them , that that Prince which shall follow can not but conclude them in his heart to embrace the same disloyalties upon like apprehensions : discontents rising from the ingratitude of human nature , which for the most part forgets former benefits if unsatisfied in his last wishes . Thus Northumberland 's paradoxical view that the only nobilityto fear would be those who would rise up to act in his behalf . As for the people . The Earl expressed their discontents and warned the King against depending on popular support if he should try to take the crown by force . The popular griefs are subsidies , taxes for the wars , grants of monopolies , and delays of justice , in all of which they rather condemn Her Majesty 's instruments with the burden of it than conceive any hatred of her person ; this observation being almost infallible , that a commonality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice straight than hi advancing any man 's title . I am of the opinion that it is much easier for a great man , popular in his own country , to move them to commotion , than for Your Majesty , if you were so disposed . ( And if Essex could not move them to commotion , how shall you ? ) In his reply to his " right trusty cousin , " James thanked him for his " wise , plain , and honest letter . " He agreed wholeheartedlyp357that war and rebellion would be as foolish as they would be dan-gerous : It were very small wisdom , by climbing of ditches and hedges for the pulling of unripe fruit to hazard the breaking of my neck when , with a little patience and abiding the season , I may with far more ease and safety enter at the gate and enjoy the fruits at my pleasure , in the time of their greatest maturity . . . . And what confidence could I ever have in those that for pleasure of me had betrayed their present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true that , though Princes sometimes make use of treason , yet they ever hate the traitor , with what security could I think to make my residence in a kingdom so full of traitors ? Soon James wrote to ask him about Cobham and Ralegh . And ( again ) Northumberland spoke to him more plainly than he should have . As for Cobham and Ralegh and how they bend toward your right . . . Although they be in faction contrary to some that hold with your title , yet in that point I can not deny but they be of the same mind and to run the same course . The first of these two I know not how his heart is affected . But by the latter , whom sixteen years of acquaintance hath confirmed to me , I must needs affirm Ralegh 's ever allowance of your right . And although I know him to be insolent , extremely heated , a man that desires to seem to be able to sway all men 's fancies , all men 's courses , and a man that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never be able to do you much good nor harm , yet must I needs confess what I know , that there is excellent good parts of nature in him , a man whose love is disadvantageous to me in some sort , which I cherish rather out of constancy than policy , and one whom I wish Your Majesty not to lose , because I would not that one hair of a man 's head should be against you that might be for you . Whether or not the King could ever accept his judgment of Essex , Northumberland 's account surely contained disturbing news for the King . That he was well rid of him : " I must say , justly , that although Essex was a man endowed with good gifts , yet was his loss the happiest chance for Your Majesty and Englandthat could befall us ; for either I do fail in my judgment , orp358he would have been a bloody scourge to our nation . " But most surprising to the King was the statement that Essex had never had any intention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring himself to power . Did he not decree it that it was scandalous to our nation that a stranger should be our King ? . . . How often have I heard him inveigh against you among such as he conceived to be birds of his own fortune ? Did his soldiers and followers dream or speak of anything but of his being King of England ? . . . Well , to conclude , he wore the crown of England in his heart these many years , and therefore far from setting it upon your head if it had been in his power . James could only hope that it was not the truth . But , true or false , until then he had never had reason to imagine Essex had been betraying him as well as the Queen . The King was left wonderinghow much Northumberland knew of what had passed between him and Essex . These doubts are greatly to Cecil 's advantage . He is grateful to Northumberland for planting them . Finally , and perhaps more in private jest than for any other purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unnamed person . ( Who appears to be none other than Cecil ! ) Thus Cecil has the pleasure of seeing himself presented favorably and defended against criticism . Saying first that Cecil supports his title , " that after Her Majesty upon whom he layeth the foundations of his fortune , that the secret of his conscience doth conclude your title to be the next right , that his heart will then wish that it may have approbation with all men and that for the present he will not be the man to wrong you . .. . Northumberland goes on to deny that Cecil could ever support the claims of the Infanta . Stakes his honor on it . Points to the clemency following the Essex rising as positive proof of this . If he should affect to bring in the Infanta , as has been laid to his charge , which way would he work it , when all his friends be contrary with whom he converseth ? By himself I know he can not do it . And there is nothing more odious in his nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor , a thing that should not slide under my pen but upon assured grounds . This may be further induced for a confirmation that I hold  --  was not the clemency that hath been used to all the nobility that offended in the last rebellion and many others that were conceived to lean toward Your Majesty ? Was it anybody else that saved Southampton ? Has he not mitigated the extremities against Mountjoy ? And should not Essex have gone near to have lived if an assured combustion in our state must not of necessity have followed by his life ? If these are not sufficient warrants for my judgment , to conclude that his heart is not Spanish , I refer it to Your Majesty 's wisdom and submit myself to your further knowledge . Nevertheless out of the trust it hath pleased you to repose in me , I must give you notice that I can not believe he will ever open himself unto Your Majesty , upon any condition , so long as Her Majesty lives . For he is very wise and is not ignorant how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should think or look toward a new sun . . . . For he is very wise . . . . It is clear to Cecil that the King will not ever trust Northumberland . And that if the transformation of the King of Scotland comes to pass and he is settled securely on the English throne , Northumberland will be wonderfully dispensable . But Cecil can see that he will be of some value to the King at the beginning . And there is one important way that he will be of value to Cecil , though he can not so much as hint at this . No doubt Lord Henry will be rewarded promptly enough . Will surely be sworn onto the Privy Council . The blending together of Lord Henry 's generalineptitude and his malice toward many could make him dangerous . He will be better off with a rival on the Council . What better rival than Northumberland ? Who will attract his malice and will leave Cecil free to consolidate and strengthen his own position . Finding place for Northumberland on the new Council will ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is beholden to the man . Well , many in England now are writing letters to King James . Some from every faction . And some whose sole faction is self-in/terest . Thanks to the King 's goodwill , but more than that to Cecil 's own intelligencers , he knows who they are and what they are telling the King . As far as he can tell there are few among the Court and Council who seriously support the claims of any other than the King . The Lady Arabella , far from London at her grandmother 's Hardwick Hall ( one of the few houses in England which Cecil truly envies ) is being closely guarded . Thanks to her latest attempt to marry her way to the throne . No one can even come near without Cecil 's permission . Which can serve a double purpose . Certainly she is prevented from plotting to seize the throne before James can be proclaimed . And yet , if something should change , if something should happen  --  and who knows ? who knows ?  --  to deny James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as not to be denied her rights . Why does Cecil deceive himself ? As if the wager were still to be made . As if he himself , studying these papers , even his own letters , like a scholar from another era , had not long since committedhimself . Slowly , to be sure . As in love and seduction . But by now he stands or falls with James . The Queen could change everything with one public word . But the Queen keeps her silence on the subject . She could die in. the night , any night . Or she could live and rule for another decade . She has been melancholy since the return here to Richmond . The death of her old friend and cousin , wife to the Lord Admiral , the Lady Nottingham , here at Richmond has grieved her . She may not endure her grief . Or she may . Tomorrow she may be dancing to pipe and tabor with her Maids of Honor . Tomorrow may send for Mr. Secretary and , aimingto lift a burden off his hunched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be James of Scotland . Or may be not . . . . Tomorrow she may . But it is already tomorrow . He rubs weary eyes . Carefully places his papers in the chest and locks its several locks . He splashes more cool water in his face . Pauses as he counts the bells of a chiming clock . He must now hurry back to his chambers and be snug in his bed when the time comes for his servants to wake him . He must shake one old snoring fellow just outside the door , wake him like a dog . Top361help him into his cloak . To light the lantern and , muttering softly to himself , lead the way . As for himself , what 's his hope and assurance ? Why , promises and good wishes like everyone else . The King has written : I can not also omit to display unto you the great contentment I receive by your so inward and united concurrence in all the paths that lead to my future happiness , most heartily wishing you to continue in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward you , whom I know to be only moved for the respect of conscience and honor , to deserve well at the hands of a lawful , natural , and loving successor to your Queen and country .

" During the last of forty-nine and first months of the new year  --  when Edward Seymour , Duke of Somerset , fell from eminence and it looked like William Cecil was sure to stumble also , I spent much time in Cambridge listening to sermons . I began to imagineI might have a calling . In those shortest days of the year , I began to believe I might become a preacher of the Gospel . " Now you will laugh out loud at the idea . And so will I. " Time and more daylight and better weather soon relieved me of most of my religious fervor . By Christmastime of fifty Cecil had managed to separate his fortunes from the Duke 's and soon climbed higher  --  to be Secretary to King Edward . This fallen world began to look shinier then . . . . " Cecil sent word for him to come down following the present term . And so it was that early in the week after Easter , lightheadedless from the spirit of the risen Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he hefted the wooden chest containing his worldly goods out of the gate of St. John 's and up along High Street , to the Black Bear Inn on Market Hill . Placed chest among the goods and baggage of a four-wheeled , six-horse wagon . Then climbed up to sit on it among a few other passengers bound for London . " I remember next to nothing of that journey now . I recall inconstantspring weather . Sunshine , then rain , then mud , next sun , and soon again dust rising from the road . Clusters of clouds and then clearing . Myself soaking wet . Then steaming dry in my cloak . " And on the last day of it , rainy winds vanished . Sun burned warm in a cloudless sky . And earth , and everything that was now suddenly sprouting , growing , and blooming on it , was as sweet as can be after a rain and everything was invested with shining clarity as if seen through fine glass . He felt as if he gulped down a glassful of strong wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tip of his tongue . He was no longer stiff and sore from cramped traveling . Had already forgotten the miles behind him.  |p367Forgetting  finally even himself . Becoming only part of the day he was witnessing . Possessed by the skywide splendor of it . It is just so , in that spirit , that he first sees the city . As the wagon continues to crawl  --  feeling as if it might be a barge floating on calm water  --  along Bishopsgate Road , he sees off to his left the squat church towers and spires of the villages of Hackney and Stepney . And to his right , to the west , on somewhathigher ground , the windmill and the slender spire and the cluster of trees marking Islington . Now straight ahead , directly down the road , across fields with scattered houses and buildings and churches , rising to fill the wide horizon like a vast painted cloth , there stand the battlemented wall , the gates and gatehouses , towers and tourelles , of London . Many more than a hundredspires and steeples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . Harbor where spires and towers are like the masts of ships . All of it stretching between , to his left , the White Tower , at the heart of the Tower of London , weathervanesglinting from four corners , to the tower and tallest of all spires of Paul 's Church atop its hill . And then farther to the west , a distance beyond the city walls and earth and green of some open spaces , the towers and long roof of St. Peter 's Church at Westminster Abbey and , too , the roofs of the Hall , the Old Palace and Whitehall Palace and of the great houses lining the banks of the Thames . And all of it shining for him then and now , this city built betweenand among low hills and marshy ground by a river . This ancient city , newly baptized by this day 's skyful extravagance of afternoon sunlight . Within him as the wagon rolls on , routine and unhurried , a paradoxical spirit prevails . It is as if he were made of canvas , a sail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tense and lighthearted . Feeling from his first sight that whatever has altered himself has done so for as long as he may live to remember it . Feeling  --  as much with his skin now as inwardly  --  smitten , blinded . Like some foolish knight in one of those old tales of courtly love . Schoolboy that he still was , he turned away from the intensity of experience , like someone stumbling , and reached out to catch hold of something that he had by heart :  |p368Urbem  quam dicunt Romam , Meliboee , putavi Stultus ego huic nostrae similem .. . Tityrus speaking out , in the first Eclogue of Virgil . Telling Meliboeus how it had been for him to come to the city of Rome from his little market town in the hills . Confessing how nothing in all of his life till then had prepared him for what would happenthere and for what he would see and feel . Like a poor fool , my friend , I imagined that the city called Rome was like ours ... . But it was not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . It was altogether different . It emptied the insidesof the purse of Tityrus like a gutted fish . Sent him home with a broken heart . So London also would prove not to be another market town . Not like any other English town . He knew this at first sight , thanks to the advantage of Virgil to guide him . To guard him . For there was , at his heart , just as there is in lust , a palpable sense of danger . Which served to heighten joy and excitement . To make them all the more precious for being threatened . But that was once upon a time . It will not be so again . Never the same ( as he knew even then ) though a hundred or a times in memory , he will see himself as a youth on a baggagecart . Coming toward this magic destination as once , say , pilgrims and crusaders came toward the walls and gates of Jerusalem . The man remembering knows this and knows also that even the look of the city would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it takes to tell its fields and suburbs would be filling up , crowded with new houses and buildings . That much that was old and fine in the city would come down for the sake of what could be called ( for its brief time ) new . That even the most proud and permanent shapes could be altered forever in one wink of time . A crack of thunder and a flashing tine of light in the sky . And the spire of Paul 's Church was all on fire and soon all gone . He can still picture that young man coming along with the baggage cart . Bouncing on Bishopsgate Road . He can picturep369that , and even now his spirit will dance . But will dance to a different tune . Sometimes he wishes he could cry out a warning to the boy with his name and face . That he could enter into his own memory , as a dreamer can sometimes enter his own dream , as if it were a stage and the dream a play , with full knowledge that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pitiless present and step into his past . Could speak to the young man he was . But if he could , what would he say ? What could be said that the boy would be able to believe ? And , belief or not , what could he say that might serve to change anything ? There 's another question that he would prefer not to ask himself . And that is  --  whether a change , any change at all , good fortuneor bad , better times in exchange for worse , would be worth the weakening and diminishment of the once-realized feeling of precious and precarious joy ? He would not wish to lose that to gain anything . Instead , in this memory which is so close to a dream , he stands by the roadside watching the cumbersome wagon pass.  |p373You  have yourself an excellent seat , most comfortable bench with a back and a soft , fat embroidered cushion you 'd be happy to own . You have a view of all the stage ( as well it ought to offer at the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gathered around the stage platform . You can see the people in the ring of penny seats in the lower galleries . You sit highest , beneath the thatched roof . There are the young courtiers , too , gaudy flock , with their chairs and stools set upon the stage at the edge of it . A few in the Lords ' boxes directly over the tiring-house . Who must see the actionbackward and from above , but who can be well seen and appreciated . Curried and curled and shined and barbered and groomed , they are here for all to see in all their Court clothing . The clothes worn by any one of them , it 's said , would buy and sell any theater several times over . Even such a grand one as this . Is that surprising ? Hardly so anymore . Many of these fellows are sowing more debts than wild oats , and will live at the mercy of any sort of pawn-taker or Dutch moneylender to die on hay among the company of debtors and felons . Yet meanwhile how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! They are players from a more encompassing play . Who have come here to witness this one especially because it 's new , but also because they have heard that its subject and performance will suit them well . It was played first , less than a fortnight ago , across the river as a part of the revels in the handsome Hall of Middle Temple . It is something that nrnist I ) e seen . Better be seen now , since it 's notp374likely to be played often . Well , it did well with those lawyers and judges , to be sure , and few of the courtiers have left during performance . Those who did so made no great show of departure , but tiptoed away like embarrassed shadows . Meaning they had appointments that must be kept . Those who have remained have remained quiet and still . This play would seem to be somewhat too sharp , somewhat too satirical , even , in a curiously comic sense , somewhat too sad to show for the Queen this year . Perhaps such a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good while ago . But there was no play like this one , then . Now she needs cheering . And since this company is the Lord Chamberlain 's , it will be called upon to make some of that cheer at Court . But with something more suitable for her mood . It 's not a play for merchants and the men of the Guilds , either . But , then , few plays are . Anyway , they will hear all about it from their servants and apprentices who 've come here today ; who are better off spending three hours in the playhouse than in a tavern , drinking and gambling . It is not a play  --  oh , no , not by any means !  --  for your sober Puritans . Who would not laugh and who would be confirmed and strengthened in their opinions of the Devil 's playground . Yet they might be surprised , if they looked and listened , at how close the world of this play is to the real one they worry and pray over . Truth is , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the world goes always about its blithe and doomed way as if perceptions of the pious were Bedlam lunacy . Yet they do not need this , or any other play , to assist them . They have lectures and sermons . God bless them , they can sing their psalms together and be content . This is not even a play intended to be diverting to the general crowd . It 's never likely , for instance , to empty the Southwark alehouses or the Bear Garden . Or to trouble the rival playhouses  --  the little Rose , the Swan in Paris Garden  --  if it ever opens up again . Or the Fortune , across the river and the other side of London'swall near Cripplegate . Or handsome Blackfriars , all indoors under roof , where some of these same gentlemen of Court will go by coach this same evening . This play 's not likely to be played here ( or anywhere ) often.  |p375But  still , all in all , there 's a good-sized crowd for it . More than a thousand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their labors today . Labors which are almost over now . . . . Poor Hector is dead at last , as we all knew he would be . Killed here , however , in this version , by a trick . Achilles has had the body dragged offstage to be tied at the tail of his horse . To ride in his triumph . No one , on either side , seems to be greatly pleased . Ajax says it for the Greeks when he gets the news : If it be so , yet bragless let it be , Great Hector was as good a man as he . Agamemnon is skeptical , but hopeful that , finally , " our sharp wars have ended . " The surviving Trojans  --  Aeneas , Paris , Antenor , Deiphobusbelievethey have won a battle . But , of course , have lost the war . Troilus is allowed to say some last troubled words . Ending with an unlikely strong resolve . Which , even if honored , will amount to nothing . As we know . As all the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort go ; Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe . And , ceremoniously , sadly , they leave by means of two of the curtained tiring-house doors at the rear of the stage . From the third door , old Uncle Pandarus wanders in . Just in time to be cursed and beaten by Troilus . Who has , at least , learned somethingfrom his brief , unfortunate experiences in love and war . Thus Pandarus ( here played by a fellow who calls himself William Smyght ) , though somewhat the worse for wear , is left onstage to have the last words in an epilogue . A sort of parodic benediction . The task before him of pleading for sympathy . When only laughter is forthcoming , he pulls himself together , French pox and all , to win their applause with witty insults : . . . weep out at Pandar 's fall ; Or if you can not weep , yet give some groans ' Though not for me , yet for your aching bones .

Till then I 'll sweat and seek about for eases , And at that time bequeath you my diseases . Rude laughter and applause . Comic bow , clownish , and he exits quickly as if he expected oranges to be thrown at him . A curtain concealing one of the Lords ' boxes above is snatched open . And there are the musicians beginning to play . The chief players now reenter for the dance around the stage . That wonderfulfool , who seemed in performance a moment ago so clownish and little and deformed ( it 's Robert Armin who 's chief clown now that Will Kempe 's gone ) as scurrilous-tongued Thersites , is back to lead the jig .

One of them steps forward to seize the pretty boy who played Helen of Troy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Helen ) in a lively dance . Cheers from the ground . Players dance away . Music plays the audience to the doors . And now a boy has come to fetch you to the tiring-house to meet the player you have come here to see . ... Come now , he says . He , like the other actors in this noisy cheerful room  --  there 's wine , there 's laughter and much crowding about of friends and admirers  --  is dressing , with the assistance of an apprentice for the tricky lacing of things , for the world . Half locked in study of his looking glass as he removes paint , he is talking like a man who has not spoken to anyone for a while . Like someone who has been shipwrecked and only just now saved . . .. Come now , he 's saying . You must admit that there is in our bestial nature the very twitch and shudder of contrarities  --  so many of such that a stranger to this earth , a man , say , from the far Bermudas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon , observing our sundry mundane chores and pleasures , watching us as we seek to go on living till we die , would swear in good faith that that is all we are , namely , no more than bundles of contradictions , like bundles of kindling wood in search of ap377fireplace to call home ; this contradiction , then , this wince of paradox ; which , like a rotten tooth that shortly plans to bid mouth and jaw farewell ; this tooth which is beginning to reveal its secretintentions by a shivery and shooting pain ; and then , mind you , only when the tip of the tongue may choose to explore it ; only when tongue touches it , will that forlorn , rebellious , alienated , **25;10426;TOOLONG wretch of a tooth , so white and shiny and sound on outside and all poison and corruption at heart ( like certain fine gents of Court who shall never be named this side of Tyburn 's gallows by these lips of mine ) ; only then will this wretched and dissembling tooth send forth an unmistakablemessage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messengers running eagerly toward you to bring you a generous invitation to join in the world 's close harmony with some loud howling of your own ; and , sir , I ask you , does the sure and certainknowledge that this consort of pain , this petty concert of inner and outer howling , will follow as swiftly behind the touchingof the aforesaid tooth as , shall we say , the swiftest greyhound coursing half a step and one snap of jaw behind the puff of white fluff at the arse of a running hare , does knowledge of what will happen serve to prevent your educated tongue from doing its worst ( ? ) ; I 'll answer it does not ; not so , for the tongue , though lord and master of many pleasures , until that same tongue finds himself too old and tired to care what 's the difference between white salt and sugar ; the tongue of man , I say to you , by its very nature is forever an adventurous explorer  --  a Drake or Hawkins , a Cavendish or Frobisher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explore every inch of this world , bitter and sweet , smooth and rough , hot and cold ; tongue would touch and taste it all ; but can only go where head is ; and this side of Tyburn or the Tower , head is most likely to be found where feet will take it ; which  --  that is , where head and feet go  --  is too often , between meals and the sweet and sweaty sessions of love , likely to be nowhere that tongue would choose to be ; tongue then , comfortably imprisoned and idle , yet curious as any house cat , will explore the pains and pleasures of where it is ; will therefore touch that tender tooth and will start with an innocent surprise each time the fain makes you howl like a krummhorn or a hautbois ; and so tongue will continue until that poor tooth bep378yanked out and discarded ; and even then , sir , it will continue to find content , in exploration of the empty space where tooth was , remembering the poor old fellow fondly ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once pushed into the well . . . . . . . I began with the notion that there is contradiction within us , division in one and all . One of a bundle of many of the same . Which , taken together , make us whoever we are . I began there and then , like a spider on a summer morning , I spun out of myself  --  and , I might as well confess , out of the rags and tatters of many others , my betters , from whom I must beg , borrow , and steal as best I can  --  I spun out a figure for my thought . An odd figure of speech , made all the more so by both the style and the digressions , by all the decoration , as it were ; making strange that which is common . That is , I could have said , could n't I ? : There is a paradox in our nature . Though we love pleasure , we play with pain like a tongue toying with a bad tooth . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in acquiescence , like Papist priests bowing around an altar . As we might nod and agree to such wisdom as : The wolf eats the sheep and the great fish eat the small . Ah , yes ! Yes , indeed ! If fools were wearing white caps , then we should all of us seem no more than a flock of geese . Can you quarrel with that ? He that leaves certainty and sticks to chance , when fools play the pipes , he must dance . No ? All gems from the treasury of the accumulated country wisdom of England . I could say such things and you would nod agreement , thinking safely to yourself : I will get common sense and wisdom from this fellow as soon as I shall get a fart from a dead horse . . . . There now . As soon as this lazy , turnip-fingered boy can finish my tags and points correctly , I shall be ready to call myself dressed . And then we may go . Where was I ? Paradox . Tooth and tongue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . .. . Oh , well . Nothing so monumental was intended , I assure you . Merely a figure of speech in anticipation to what I assume your first question will have to be . And what would that be ? . . . I am assuming , sir , that having bravely sat for more thanp379two hours and witnessed our play  --  and I trust in good comfort and hope with some pleasure , having sat there and seen this afternoon'sperformance , which , on the whole , went well , I do believe . . . . Very well . From first to last . . . . Why , I thank you , sir . For myself and all these others . To resume , you will no doubt have wondered why our poet and these players should trouble themselves with the matter of Troy . Why a crowd of people should have come here to spend their afternoontransported to an antique , imaginary Troy . A Troy that never was , nor ever will be , beyond the edges of our stage . Why they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strut and swagger , rant and rave , pretending to be Greeks and Trojans . You are wondering , what with all the struttingand swaggering , ranting and raving , out there all around us in every which direction , with London and her suburbs offering up more comedies and tragedies , more wonderful jests for ninniesand more miserable tales of woe than company of players could ever hope to imitate , why we are here . For a penny they could climb the tower of Paul 's Church . For a penny they could see the Tower of London and the wondrous zoo there . For a penny they could be guided through Westminster Abbey and touch the graves of kings . Why have all of these people come here to be transported to an antique and imaginary Troy ? . . . Come now , he says . Surely you have been wondering about that . I might have wondered about that if I had had a chance to do so . But I never left Troy and the tents of the Greeks . . . . God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More than could be expected , I think . Lowers the looking glass to stare in your face , frowning , his eyes narrowing . Someone else , someone who has not been where you have been and done what you have had to do , might even be intimidated by his expression of controlled ferocity . For you the problem is not to laugh . Lest like a flushed bird this fellow shall flee away before he can be snared . So be it . You hasten to reassurehim . Perish the thought . Pray continue if you please . Now his laughter bubbles at the lips , then bursts out loud.  |p380Fills  the room . The others , startled , pause in the midst of their changing from Greeks and Trojans into Englishmen . Pause to watch as he pulls away from the lad who 's lacing his right sleeve at the shoulder . Pulls away and , without a glance to see if it is still there , falls back upon a joint stool , shakes his head , and laughs and laughs . ... Please forgive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always seem to be acting whether I want to or no . Forever playing the fool . It seems to be my nature . " And you are more convincing off the boards than on them , " one of the actors ( the youth who played Troilus ) calls out . ... Surely someone was convinced this afternoon . You heard the applause . " They were happy to know it was over and done with , " says another , the boy who played Helen , cause of all trouble and tragedy . " Oh , it is true that you were excellent today , " Ulysses tells your player . " As Pandarus you have no rival . You could play the part without rehearsal , without troubling to learn by heart a singlespeech . " ... Do n't tell that to the poet or he will punish you by cutting some of your interminable speeches . Chances are he 'll make you the arse end of a horse in his next comedy . " We shall hire you for that part , knowing how you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing again . The apprenticepatiently lacing his sleeve . ... I am not , as you see , a member of this company . They wish you to know that . Yet to whom do they turn in haste and with many pleas and promises , at the very last minute , mind you , when their own worthy Pandarus overeats or overdrinks or overdoeswhatever it may be ( aside from acting ) that he truly does well ? To whom do they come when they must have someone or have no play at all ? Why , for certain , they come pounding on my door like petty constables . Coming to find me , because , coarse threads though they are , they know where quality goods may be found . .. . It 's true I am not one of this proud company and never will be.  | . . . But by far heaven and the Pope 's red , rosy ass , I was already a player and performing every kind of part you can imaginewhen most of these scurvy fellows were still trying to learn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horseshit in a barn . . . . Listen , your honest English player has got as many scars on his back as any old Winchester whore . To prove thereby his longevity among the fraternity of rogues and vagabonds , of minstrelsand fiddlers and jugglers and suchlike masterless men . I 'll wager gold I am the only man here in this tiring-house who has been whipped down the street at the cart 's arse and can prove it , too . " I do not doubt you at all , " says Achilles , who has been broodingmost handsomely until now , and who now stands , dressed and looking more like a courtier than those who sat on the stage today . " No doubt , however , it was not so much a matter of law as it was their unanimous judgment of the quality of your acting . " Before Pandarus , stung , it seems ( who knows ? ) , can rise from his stool to reach for his sword on its hook , it is Helen of Troy who speaks out and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to laughing again . " There was a fellow that was with this same company last year  --  or maybe it was the year before  --  who had lost one ear in the pillory . Whether it was the left ear or the right one , I ca n't remember . But no doubt at all that one ear was gone . " . . . See that ye despise not one of these little ones , for I say unto you that in heaven their Angels behold the face of my Fatherwhich is in heaven . " Where is that speech to be found ? " poor Helen asks . . . . Why , ' t is a part I am struggling diligently to memorize and later to play . More laughter . Dressed , putting on cloak and buckling sword , he 's ready to leave . He leads you with him , passing close by Achilles . . . . If it seems that I have been appropriately cast as Pandarusin this play , consider young Achilles here . Who would sooner creep into his scabbard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pandarus ? " . . . Yes ?  | " Were you really whipped at cart 's tail ? " ... Yes , by God , I truly was . And it was in Bristol  --  of all forsaken places , a town where half the population could be whipped on one day and the other half on the next without doing injustice to any innocent person . And , do you know ? , they hired a fiddler , a fellow I knew well , as it happens , and so pickledfrom many years in many taverns that he 'd lost the knack of it and played the fiddle about as well as a Barbary ape . Hired this poor fellow to walk along and play in front of the cart while I was whipped through the streets . And the whole time , in all that pain and shame , I was thinking that the worst punishment was having to listen to his fiddling . . . . Ah , but that , my friends , is another tale for another time and place . It has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of your fools falls ill again , pray remember me . And out into brisk air , waning afternoon light . Shouts rising up from the Bear Garden . Where , no doubt , some English mastiff has just now had his head crunched like a ripe apple . And so the world 's bloody afternoon continues . As it was and ever shall be . So begins your part in it . Well , you can kill this fellow here , this common player , if you have to . Can leave him dead in alley or ditch , if it comes to that , not losing sleep over it . Oh , sweet Lord Jesus , no ! Too late for that , for regrets or bad dreams . Yet you find yourself hoping that all will go well . Except for a hearty thirst , you are feeling fine . The play was a pleasure , and this odd bird may yet amuse you . . . . Sir , he is saying . May I recommend that we walk to the Bridge and cross over there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a play at Bankside . Something for luck . Besides , if you save the money you would spend on the hire of a boat , let me tell you there are two excellent taverns , one at each end of the Bridge . And it would be a shame to pass them by without pausing long enough to wish each other good health and good fortune and a safe crossing of London Bridge . ... And what could be more pleasant than a walk on such a fine day as today ? Yes , it is more than tolerable for the time of year.  | . . . Indeed , sir , it is so . Well , then , let us walk back through the Clink to the Bridge . . . . You are not a Puritan , are you ? I mean , sir , you do not look like one . But in this duplicitous age all the world seems to be populated with players . Listen , I have seen whoremasters who could pass for Scots preachers . And just the other day I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must admit he was at a distance  --  wholooked every inch an Italian fop . Since you were open enough to ask a question to settle your doubts , may I ask you one ? . . . At your pleasure . You are not Irish , are you ? . . . Oh , my God , sir ! You ask a question like a cudgel to the side of the head . Irish ? My God , not hardly ! Not hardly at all . Why , that is like asking if my mother was a whore and my grandmother a better one . I am sorry if I have offended you . . . . Your question showed nothing of impercipience . The truth is , I have spent some time , and too much of it , in Ireland . After that unfortunate business in Bristol , I was impressed and shipped over to serve as a soldier in the bogs . Where they must have believed I would be buried with many another Englishman , not to mention the Irish , who 've kept the grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have lived to tell the tale of it . And in a sense you may not be so far from the mark , after all . For if I have not one drop of cloudy Irish blood in my veins , I confess there must be a crew of Irish bastards who may have more than a drop of my own . There 's no waste in nature . I 've left more new ones behind me than ever I killed . . . . In the name of good old double-dealing Nicodemus , let us talk no more of Ireland . Let us look to the present and try not to dwell too much upon the cloudy past . . . . Here we are in fair Southwark . Home for most of the watermenand half the whores of London . Home for the Bishop of Winchester 's Palace and for five different jails . Three of which have , at one time and another , sheltered my poor , and always innocent , skin and bones . Ilona. also , sir , of many fine inns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we enter thatp384one yonder with the sign of the White Bear . Which we call the Bear at Bridgefoot . Now , you begin to spend time visiting a number of taverns . The two of you are keeping track of neither how much time is passing nor at how many of these cheerful places the time goes by . As to the former , you depend upon London law which says that no drink may be sold after eight o'clock in the evening at this season . You count on this , allowing always for the possibility that any such fellow as this will know of a place or two , within his ward and neighborhood , where he and his friend may circumventthe letter of the law . And as for the latter , why , it 's true that these taverns are as different in a little of this and that as one man is from another , but as afternoon blends into evening , they begin to seem as much alike as a row of trees . They are crowded and noisy with some music being played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shout in order to be heard at all . There are thick gray clouds , a patch of fog if you will , of the aromatic tobacco smoke from many pipes . Which , no matter how expensive tobacco is , hold the fashion in London nowdays . You can hire a pipe in any of these taverns if you feel inclined to smoke . The Player has his own which he carries with him in a fat wallet on his belt . It 's a short-stemmed pipe with a large silver bowl , upon which bowl is graved somebody 's proud heraldic arms . ... It came to me fairly and honestly , he says , and by a single roll of the dice . He keeps puffing like a blacksmith 's chimney . He has mastered the art of making circles and other odd shapes with the smoke . Which allows him to call himself a Professor of smoking , prepared to teach these tricks to anyone foolish enough to pay him to learn . No one in these taverns is so foolish . For they all seem to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each place you enter . Goodwill grows warmer when they discover the Player is accompanied by a gentleman with a purse who can pay the reckoning . They gather in groups around the table to exchange jests and quips . To watch him , free for nothing , blow his marvelous shapesp385with tobacco smoke . And a few to cadge themselves a free cup of wine or a bottle of ale . You and he are not drinking ale . Nor beer , the son of ale , nor hard Devon cider . Nor any of the lighter wines  --  claret or cute . None of your muscadine or malmsey , no old Rhenish or new Rhenish , not Italian Vernage , Malvesin Greek , not Rhine wines nor either your full-bodied Romeney from far off Romania . No , sir , nothing will do for today ( and tonight ) but something restorative , a medicinal drink for healthy men  --  shining Sack from Canary ( he 'll have it from no place else , not even Andalusia ) with just a mite of white sugar stirred in as an aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proper prologue to a session of Sack drinking  --  for our Player has been a full three hours now without a drop of anything stronger than some double beer for the sake of his throat and voice and must now make haste to recover lost time , you commenced at the Bear at Bridge f oot with a full cup of what they call ( schoolmasters of taverns ) spiritus dulcis , and he translated on the spot as " the spirit that giveth life when flesh is ready to hang itself and be damned . " Which , whatever it is called , is alchemical creation composed of Sack distilled twice over and flavored with spirit of roses and with candy . It clears nose and throat , cleans the eyes with fresh tears , tingles the toes and fingernails and does cause the stomach to leap and rejoice like a young lamb . . . . And now , says he , you are baptized for serious drinking of good Canary Sack . By the time you have done both ends of the Bridge and then turned away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mitre  --  " not , mind you , the one by that name in Cheap , up by Mercer 's Hall close to the Conduit and St. Mary Colechurch , but rather the other one toward the south end of Bread Street , close by the river , " or else to the Mermaid found on Old Fish Street , between Bread and Friday 's ; or probably both , both places where you stand a good chance to meet with players and poets and the self-anointed quickest tavern wits in London ; by that time you will be feeling careless as a wide-winged Angel soaring along the edges of an April breeze ; feeling much too cheerful to permit yourself to worry much over the knowledge which you can not dismiss with a shrug and a quip  --  namely that when youp386awake in the morning ( if you live that long ) , you will feel nothing like any Angel and like nothing so much as a shabby blackbirdbaked alive in a piecrust . Your best hope for the future is the silent , solemn promise to yourself that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel and the cobblestones of Londonbegin rolling beneath you like the deck of a ship , you shall begin to care for yourself like a well-paid physician . That you shall begin , very soon now , to measure and count your doses of this medicine . That you shall decline some refreshment or , failing that , you will , sly fox , pour out some of this very drink in lieu of any attempt to match this fellow . For it 's clear as can be there shall be no keeping up with him . Not since London Bridge has there been any serious rivalry between you . He has already swallowed enough to drown a warhorse ; yet still his eyes are open and alert . His tongue has yet to turn into a woolen blanket to wrap around words . And his words , they run like hounds finding and following one scent after another . More ( it seems ) for the joy of running , for the sake of barking and belling , than for anything else . All this while names of taverns begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the Horn and the Cock and the Dagger , the Swan and the Star and the Phoenix , Windmill and Tripoly , the King 's Head and the Saracen 's Head , and not to forget the Woolsackor the Three Cranes in Vintry . Where , at the last , and grateful for the large mercy of it , you are introduced to Oysters in Bastard Gravy , oysters cooked with ale and bread crumbs and seasoned with ginger and pepper and sugar and saffron . Which is enough to send you on , without tripping or toppling , to the Mermaid . Where a winter salad of boiled turnips and beets and carrots , followed by sturgeon cooked in claret , some chicken and fruit in a pie , and ending with a sweet pie of apples and oranges , leaves you if not as sober as a Tyburn hangman , then more sober than any Justice of the Peace in England . And thus both of you able to find your way to his house , with the aid and comfort of a pair of link boys from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk upright , singing and whistling a little , it 's true , but not loud enough to wake any sleeping citizens or to cause the Watch to arrest you for a pair of common Rousers and Nightwalkers.  | . . . Do n't worry and fret , he assures you , clutching a brace of two-quart pottles of Sack , bought just before eight o'clock . They know me well , the Watch , for what I am  --  a gentleman and scholar . Gent and scholar seems to have lost his hat . Perhaps at the Mermaid . But you have yours on , squarely , and you can manage to walk with shoulders back and a certain loose swagger at the hips . As you follow the player and the shadow and dancing of the torchlight , you pass the time between here and there by the reinventionof your conversation with this fellow . Most of the time it was more like soliloquy than exchange . But no matter . Soliloquy is his craft . And none of it was truly pertinent until it came time at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come to find him . All the time before that was only preparation for you . Meantime you had him to listen to . Story of his life . Which telling you have been resigned to since you entered the tiring-house at the Globe and shook his hand . Has there ever been a player who did not love the story of his life better than any other ? Has there ever been a player whom you could take as an honest witness ? Not that all actors are liars , but that actors lie as much as anyone else and are more gifted at it . Well , true or false it can sometimes be entertaining . Which is some consolation since you are going to hear it , like it or not . . . . From my speech you probably take me to be a Londoner . And I think I can never be so truly at home or at ease anywhere else ; and I have been to many places in my travels . But like nearly every other Londoner I was born elsewhere and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet ) my fortune . Someone has described London as the seed-plot for the shires of England . A place from which new plants come . The opposite is true . Raw country stock comes to London and takes root here . It 's those who have flourished and come into wealth here that go forth to spend it by buying lands and building houses . Begins a talc that 's familiar , but no less true for being so . Story of a poor child in a parish far from London . He is vague , but by the sound of ' it and the harshness of the life he summons up , it must 1w the north . Though likely no farther north than York/shire . His father was a laborer for the manor farm . Working for wages and those wages small . Often hungry ( as he remembers it ) often cold and raggedy as Lazarus , the children , his brother and sisters and some other kin who were orphans . His father , a vague tall memory , died young . His mother became an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she married again , a younger man , a worker no richer than his father had been  --  " which is to say , sir , penniless . " One who had lost his own wife and had some young children to look after . This boy had early proved himself quick to learn . The Schoolmastertook care with him , and there was talk of sending him away to the grammar school in the nearest market town . But then it was that his mother married again , and soon he was sent off to be an apprentice to some kinfolk of his mother . Who lived , as it happened , in London . . .. I sometimes think , he says , I might have been a scholar . Gone on to the university or the Inns of Court . But what then ? There 's many a university wit I 've known here in London who has been forced to borrow from me to pay his reckoning . To London to learn a skill , and he not quite twelve years old at the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school and study also , under the Queen 's law , her dream that all of Englandshall read and write in her time . . . . You mentioned mixed feelings , often opposed to one another . As in a mock combat . A tilt or a joust in the Tiltyard upon Accession Day . Myself in a suit of silver armor , in two suits of silverarmor . Each suit worth the price of London Bridge with all the shops and houses on it and all the goods therein . Myself against myself , layered with the favors of half the ladies of Westminster , on a huge English warhorse , ready to break a lance on the shield of myself . . . . Oh I never miss it when I am here in London in Novemberand can acquire a ticket , preferably without paying for it . I can strut and jet with the best of them . And doff my borrowed hat and cry Vivat Regina when the Queen and her ladies appear in the Gallery and the games begin . .. . You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And once was among the knights and lords in the yard . Albeit not as one of them , but as one of a flock of Centaurs  --  players we were , set cun/ningly upon hairy little ponies from the isles of Scotland .

As well as , alas , in two pieces . . . . . . . But there are other times . Bleaker . Darker . When the emblemof my feelings is not so grand . When I close my eyes and picture no palace and tiltyard , but rather a stinking prison , cold and dirty . Wherein a pair of half-naked wretches are wrestling with one another , groaning and gasping as they roll and slither in filthy straw . For what ? For a loaf of stale bread tossed to them . Which they will not share . Bloody and sweaty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrestle until one is defeated . Lies spent and limp , heaving to breathe . While the other scuttles away to the corner like a rat  --  indeed , most likely kicking aside the rats to act like a rat himself  --  to gulp and choke down his tasteless bread . Yet with a sense of joyous triumph and with contempt for the other fellow on the floor , my wretched , meager , distressed , and disgusting companion . Who now is weeping like a woman or a child . Who now rolls over so that the thin light from the window falls briefly on his face . And then , of course , I see that he is cursed with my face also . That my enemy is only my-self ! . . . You see , then , the layers of it . Truth must be a woman , for it is so covered and disguised with so many layers of clothing . What I mean to say is that it seems even my mixed feelings are an odd alloy and often counterfeit . False coins . Even my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir ? Perhaps it is the source of your craft as a player . . . . Could you believe and accept my Pandarus ? I can not imagine him other than as you made him out to be . . . . Bless you , then ! Let us drink to the stage . . . . Let me return to the solid earth . If I can . It 's Sack and sugar that has taken away my tongue with a writ of habeas corpus . Maybe I should change my drink . I hear of a doctor in Bishopsgate who sells a most wonderful medicine made of distilledspirits and the essence of the poppy flower , cleverly blended together . A good draft of which is said to put the drinker into a nodding , speechless , happy , dreaming trance . Ip390must remember to try some one day . It might improve my dispostion . I know the stuff and do n't advise it . Pray continue with your story , if you will . . . . Less than twelve years old I came to London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And like everyone else who comes to London , I was ambushed by it . Had never imagined anything like it . How could I ? Though , for sure , I was no fool then . I had listened , all ears and hopes , many times to travelers speak of the city . I had formed an impression  --  Jerusalem and Babylon , together with some words from Nineveh and Tyre and some bits and pieces of poor old Sodom and Gomorrah . But was not prepared for this city . . . . Now one of the first things London does to anyone who comes here is to force him to reconsider his whole life up to that time . Saying to himself : " Where on earth have I been before coming here ? " . . . As to life with my kinsman , let me dispose of that simply . My story is not like the one you would hear , for the price of a tankard of beer , in this tavern or a hundred others . Malcontent tavern wits will tell you tales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running away . Of being cheated and deceived . Et cetera , et cetera . While if you were sitting down to supper even now , at the high table of some merchant 's house , some fellow from one of the Guilds ; who , if he has not already been so , has every good chance of being chosen as a Sheriff of Middlesex and maybe one day as Lord Mayor of London , such a fellow would tell you tales of industry and frugality , of skill learned well , of virtue rewarded . " It 's these ne'er-do-well , scurvy , and idle sturdy rogues , whose very souls are as lazy as old cats ; who will not work a day unless they have to ; who are perfectly content , and so have no other purpose in life , to enjoy a full belly and shoes that fit well enough , warm clothes in the wintertime , and the frequentcompanionship of a poxy drab , some wench whose ministrationscan transform oak into willow , make hempen rope from a soup bone , if you follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sleep through morning , lose the afternoon at the playhouse , and then haunt the taverns and alehouses as if they were graveyards and every night were All Hallows Eve ; ill/educated cynics who 'll tell you there 's no purpose in industry and diligence , in honest deference to one 's betters , because ( to them ) the world is all a besmeared painted cloth , no more , and what 's to be had is all leasings and orts and rotten reversion . " Look about you , sir , and consider that thirty years ago I did not own more than my wits and a pewter spoon . Let them scoff as may . Their betters will live in almshouses endowed by me . And as for themselves , a lucky few will end their days in a spital house . And their bones will rest in unmarked graves ! " You do the merchant vehemently well . . . . Why , thank you , sir . Do you imagine they really speak like that at the supper table ? Who knows or cares ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Done ! But I shall tell you neither of these lies . I was never ill treated or overworked . I was taught and I learned the skills of leatherwork well . I can still make you a fine leather belt and an excellent pair of riding boots . I delighted in learning the craft and in working at it . Likewise delighted to put on my blue coat and my flat statute cap to go forth ( whenever I was free to , which was often ) to explore the wonders of this city , stem to stern , root to highest branch . I can not claim to have been corruptedby it . . . . Yet , nevertheless , I often thought of home . With mixed feelings . . . . Exactly so . What he now tells is one of the oldest stories of England . True , as he says , the labor was almost unceasing . True there were bad times for all of them ; and these latter recollections strike at surprisingtimes , when least expected , often times of good cheer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to summon up and settle in the spirit of some character created by a poet . Child of this Queen 's reign , he has known no other sovereign , save by reading and by the tales of elders . Child of this Queen 's times , he knew ( at least until he was a grown man and was pressed to serve in war himself ) nothing but peace . Oh , as a lad he heard stories of the Earls ' Rebellion of ' 69 . When the northern Earls rose up for . . . whatever it may have been . Was shown the very tree where soiiw wen from t this same village , who hadp392marched with the Earls and were too poor to be either fined or ransomed , were hanged in the Queen 's name to set an example . . . . I never pictured myself  --  certainly not in those days  --  as being among the ragged wretches standing at the back of a cart with a rope around my neck , waiting to be hanged from a tree limb for the edification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would be the Queen 's own man , the gentleman on a horse , lookingmuch like the statue of St. George ( which no one had the Puritan malice or piety to deface ) in the parish church . A handsomefellow in armor , a knight myself no doubt . No pity in my eyes . A sneer on my lips as I told those rustic rebels to hurry up with their prayers so we could drive the cart out from under them and be off to the alehouse to wash down the dust . . . . Ah , I was a pitiless child ! At least in the stories I imagined for myself . I learned to read early , and our goodly minister would let me read in the copy of Foxe 's Book of Martyrs which was kept in the church . Sometimes I would read aloud for the benefit of some of the older folk who could not read a word . I would read to them in a loud , clear , somewhat pompous voice , in imitation of our parson reading the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of their own from the village , could read so well . And I would be amazed that these old folks , the oldest and wisest in the village , though they could not read a word , would sit there and weep for the suffering and deaths of people they had never even met , much less known of , without I had read the book to them . .. . Soon enough I knew what would move them most and soonest . And therefore I would blend and interpolate Foxe 's storiesto that effect . It pleased me greatly to see them weep . Or to save them from weeping . Once or twice I took the liberty of savinga martyr from rack or fire either by a miracle ( which they liked best ) or by the timely arrival of a band of good Christian men , who were rather like Robin Hood 's band , though led by a fine handsome fellow who looked much like the St. George in our church . . . . Those versions got back to the parson . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprentice actor before you were ever a cordwainer . It was your first craft.  | . .. I reckon that 's so . Not that I ever imagined myself as a player or any such thing . Though sometimes , I remember , I would be taken in a wagon with other children of the village to a market fair . Where we could see jugglers and tricksters and sometimes a few fellows performing a play . Most likely some story from the Scripture . Which everyone could be expected to know something of . Or else , perhaps , some old piece from the legends of old England  --  tales of King Arthur and his knights . Perhaps a jolly comic tale stolen out of Chaucer or Gower . .. . I have done it myself in lean times . Played to the bumpkins on a platform at market fair . I have been hooted as Herod and cheered as King Arthur . I would often see boys no older than I was . Some lad with a straw in his mouth and a sneer on his face . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , better or worse , except for a turn or two . You see how memory softens the past . No news to you there . But there is some sweet truth at the heart of changing . For , to begin , he knew no other way of living . Except what he read of in books . Which he took to be mostly false . He could conceive that his life was hard and was poor . But he never imagined , till he left home for London and for good , that his life was in any way seriously different from anyone else 's . Excepting , of course , the beautiful Queen with a jeweled crown on her head , sitting in glory on her throne in what might have been Fairyland or Heaven . And then there was the Knight who possessed the manor there , which included their village . Who was seldom there , except to keep Christmas hospitality , being a gentleman of the Queen 's Court . In his case there must have been ( as the child thought then ) either some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as unlike St. George as a glove is to a shoe . Perhaps , he thought , it is a disguise that he wears  --  his huge swag belly made from a cushion , his frounced gray hair and his scraggly beard being both wigs . No doubt if he and his lady , who , though somewhat more comely , seemed to be dressed in disguise also , came in their true glory , they would turn poor villagersto stone . The boy took no chances whenever , during Christmastide , this knight came . riding up the village lane , aiming generally for thep394inn , looking , for all the world , like a loosely packed , two-handed grain sack , with a hat set on top of it , and the whole thing set on a saddle on a scrawny and unwilling nag . Boy would see him , quick doff whatever rag of a hat he was wearing , with a bow and a flourish , all of this with his eyes closed . For safety 's sake . Once when Knight was coming from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy did not see horse or rider until the last moment . Startled , he leaped to pull off his hat and close his eyes . Saw only that the horse jumped , startled also . With his head bowed and his eyes closed he heard a sound , like a sack of grain ( indeed ) falling onto the muddy lane . Followed by a groan . Followed by the drumming of hooves running off into distanceand silence . Followed by a snort and then a snore and then a sequence of snores as steady as breathing . Keeping his eyes closed he backed away to where he knew there was a tree he could slip behind , then peer around . Did so and saw that Knight on his back like a beetle . Sound asleep and the rain beginning to fall . Ran to the inn and told the keeper that the Knight had gone to sleep in the lane . " Which is where he rightly belongs , " the innkeeper said . " We should leave him there to drown in his own juices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good Christian men in this village . Come , lads , let 's drag the lord out of the mud . " So off he went with a brace of drunken fellows to see if they could save the Knight without falling down themselves . Once in those days , the parson arranged for the boy to read aloud the gospel for Epiphany from St. Matthew . It was on the occasion of Twelfth Night at the manor house . When all the village , young and old , came to the Hall for cakes and ale and singingand games of chance . ( " Even as little children we knew better than to play at any game of chance with the Knight ; for it was understood that manners and Christian charity required we should let him win whatever game it might be . Though this was somewhat difficult to understand . Since the parson and the innkeeperand the others cheerfully took every coin in his purse when he played at cards or dice at the inn . " ) It was the hope of the parson that the Knight would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his education . They had rehearsedthis in Church until the parson was fully satisfied . And now the time comes and the boy is brought forward to stand before the Knight and all of the company , The Book of Common Prayer in his hands , and to read : " When Jesus was born in Bethlehem , a city of Jewry , in the time of Herod the King , behold there came Wise Men from the east to Jerusalem , saying , where is he that is born King of the Jews ? For we have seen his star in the east , and are come to worshiphim . ... Then Herod , when he had privily called the Wise Men , he inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared , and he bade them go to Bethlehem and said , Go your way thither , and search diligently for the child . And when ye have found him , bring me word again , that I may come and worship him also . . . . When they saw the star they were exceeding glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child with Mary his mother , and fell down flat , and worshipped him , and opened their treasures , and offered unto him gifts : gold , frankincense , and myrrh . And after they were warned of God in sleep that they should not go again to Herod , they returned into their own country in another way . " The old Knight , full to brim , to the edge of lips and the fringe of beard with the fumes of spirits if not with the good spirit of Christmastide , rocking back and forth on the heels of his boots . . . ( " For he was always booted and spurred both indoors and out ; and likely , it was guessed , he slept in his boots either to save the effort of bending over to put them on or because no one had found a way to pull them off his feet with ease . " ) . . . before the blazing logs on the fire , was simply furious . " Priest ! " he cried out . . . . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or did , which was not infrequently , he would call him priest ' to remind him of his Papist days and , also , as the Knight imagined , to shame him for the unhesitant ease with which he had retained his parish by taking oaths and becoming a clerk of the Church of England without any struggle of conscience . The Knight was overlooking how he himself had undergone the same transition from one faith to another , from one order of worship to another ,  |p396with  no more response than his outspoken annoyance at having to learn anew when it is proper to stand and to kneel etc . " ) " Priest ! " he cried out . " You mock me in my own house ! " " Not at all , sir , " says the parson . " I thought it might please you to see a village lad who has learned so quickly and so . well . " " Oh , indeed it does , Priest . Indeed it does . . . . " Turning to the boy he pats him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waggy-tail dog who has just done an unusual trick . Hands him a shilling . Which is more money than he has ever held in his hands before . One hand closes over the coin like a claw . It would take torture to cause him to open that fist . And the boy decides that this Knight may now say and do whatever he pleases . Because the payment of a shilling buys that privilege . Indeed for a penny he would sing and dance and turn a cartwheel . For a shilling he 'll read through the Bible forward and backward without stumbling over any words . Even the tonguetwistingnames of the Jews . " Indeed he 's a gifted little pup . No question , " the Knight continued . " A most amazing little country crow able to read those words from the book without hesitation or embarrassment . And , Priest . . . . " ( Back to the parson , his voice full of gravel again . ) " You have prepared him well for this world . There is neither place nor office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sword . ' T is an age , with a Queen on the throne and ne'er any husband to guide and direct her , ' t is an age for sweet fellows who can dance and sing . And most of all these times are ripe for clerks who are quick with words . They thrive and prosper and take precedence while those of us whose service is to protect and defend the hearthsides of England , are passed by , left high and dry , our servicesbelittled by perfumed , lacy scroyles who are more at home with a feathered pen than ever with sword and buckler , dagger and rapier , black bills and brown . . . . " ( " The satiric beauty of all this , you understand , " the Player tells you , " is that our Knight had never come nearer to war than attendance at the county muster . He safely rode out the Rising of ' 69 in his bed , suffering from an ague , brought on , no doubt , by his inability to determine which side was worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our parish , indeed the whole country , could recall his ever drawing sword from its scabbard . Not evenp397to cut a pie or a piece of cheese . None had ever seen the fellow 's blade out of the scabbard . Though he often , in moments of brief fury , such as after losing at roll of the dice or a hand of cards , swore a mighty oath and clapped hand on the hilt , as if his next move would be to yank it free and to carve up everyone in sight . Hand on hilt was as far as he went . Which divided our village into two factions . There were those who believed there was nothing more to his sword than the hilt , that hilt and scabbard were all . Others , more admiring , said that there was , indeed , a real sword there , but it had rusted tight in the scabbard through times of peace . And whoever could pull it free and draw it would be the next King Arthur . " ) " Whilst men of the sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose fathers might be any one of a dozen scabby ditchdiggers and jakesmen who found their mothers willing behind a haystack in harvest time , rascals , then , without blood or breeding or reputation , fresh from their Oxford and Cambridge and their quibbling Inns of Court , coming out of those academic laystalls where idle , cowardly , parasitical snots learn Latin words and numbers , and songs and dances and witty jests which will serve to advance them in Caesar 's world and at the expense and discomfort of their inherent betters ! There is no justice at Court in this age . And there never will be , neither , until Frenchman or Spaniard shall land in England or the Scot shall cross the borders again . Then , by God ! , these dainty fellows will be as scarce as wolves are in the city of London . Then the call will go out for swordsmen ! Pray it shall not be too late ! " With which exhortation he clangs hand on hilt and , tugging ( in vain , as ever ) steps backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become the first burned martyr this village has produced . But two husky fellows jump to seize him and pull him safely forth with no more damage to him than some scorching and smoke at the arse end of his galligaskins . " All too true , I fear , sir , " the parson says , matter-of-fact and quietly . As if nothing had happened . As if he 'd made a remark about the weather and the Knight had grunted agreement . " But now , as for the lad . . . . " " Aye , the little bit of a horse turd reads as well as any Bishop . And he shall have his reward . "  |p398Another  pat on the doggy head . Another shilling . Having , no doubt , forgotten the first one . Thus making . the boy ( with both fists turned to claws now and the Prayerbook clamped tight underarm ) the richest person beside the Knight and his lady ( who seems to have vanished ) in the Hall . " Priest , " he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I shall take him with me to read for the Queen . And I 'll wager he 'll not leave the Presence Chamber without acquiringat least the reversion of an office or a lease of some crown lands . Then , perhaps , we can go to serve him . If he can find a place for a simple old swordsman who can only claim to have done his duty , always , as he saw it to do . . . . " At which point , just as the first large , clear tears began rolling down his cheeks , a great blast of a ram 's horn came from the far end of the Hall like a giant breaking wind . And here came servantsbearing tankards of nappy ale and wonderful cakes and cream . A fiddler began to play for the country dancing . Which our fat gray knight was good at . For though he was no doubt as clumsy as a calf at Court with all their galliards , pavanes and allemandes , their basse dances and haute dances , when it came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shake-a-Trot or Bishop of Chester 's jig and suchlike , he was as lightfoot and quick as a fox moving across the crust of the snow . . .. But can you believe he truly spoke like that ? I believe you . Which is much more to the point . . . . Two shillings ! That 's the most I 've ever earned for a performancein all of my life . May it happen sometime again . . . . To continue . ( And so he does . ) You want to be just . The man saves himself from the squalor of self-pity by his unquenched humor . Which allows him to see some of the riddles of remembering as adding up to something like that sign you 'll find in certain alehouses , called the Sign of Three Fools , depicting two obviously foolish men . And where 's the third ? Why that must be you , sir , who is looking at the sign . . . . Look , sir , he 's saying to you . Look what happens when your London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That money goes into land . Land in the country andp399a house there . It is the dream of every ambitious man who comes here . Even native-born Londoners sing the same tune . They long as much as any of us , born and half raised in the country , to return to the land . Returning in triumph , to be sure . No one would slink back and pick up his old shovel and hoe again . A man would rather die here than go home again , admitting to folly and failure . Which evidence  --  that no one returns saving in prosperity  --  mightcause countrymen to misconstrue to draw inference that all who go to London prosper there . .. . Ah , sir , they know better than that . But just as I cling to illusions about country life , so the countryman keeps his illusions about the city . It makes him feel better to believe there is a place he could go , where all men prosper . Where there 's money to come by as easy as picking apples off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's throats like dogs , cut and long-tail , barking and snarling over a red bone . . . . And you would not have to be here long , sir , to notice how the Court , following the fashion of the Queen , affects countrydances and such things . To observe how all the City and the Court do contrive to keep a country calendar of holidays . As if both Court and City would prove to be pure cloudy illusions while the country and the old customs of England were as hard and true as baked Flanders brick . I have heard that Queen and Council are troubled that hospitalityis not kept in the country as it once was . . . . Yes , that 's the paradox of it . Your Court gentleman can not afford to be absent from the Court for long . Except when the Queen goes on Progress . . . . True , then they are scarce enough . Because these Progresses are tedious and troublesome for everyone but the Queen . They are uncomfortable , and there is small gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unless it 's his pleasure to steal silver spoons and such . .. . And behind all this , sir , is the great unspoken thing . What must not be said aloud , but must surely be understood as the secretcause behind so nuuly actions of these days . And what would that be , in your opinion ? . . . Well , sir , it is the Queen 's age and health . May she livep400and reign long . But it does not seem likely . It is given out that she is healthy as a horse . But there are other stories , too . Those who saw her at the latest Parliament reported she looked not well at all . That crown and robes seemed all too heavy for her . That she stumbled and had to be helped . Well , no question the Queen is old . ... What 's on the mind of the others is the Succession . Who shall follow after her ? Who do you suppose ? ... Oh , sir , I have neither opinion nor favor . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be loyal to whoever shall lawfullysucceed the Queen . Well said . ... Carefully said . Allow me that . . . . But , to dispose of your question . As I take it , the younger gentlemen of Court ( who will honor and serve whoever sits next on the throne ) tend to favor the claims of King James of Scotland . Because he is a man and a practicing King who must have learned some lessons in Scotland . And because he is a stranger . One who can offer Englanda new beginning . Of course , every new reign is a new beginning , but a new reign by a foreigner is fresh enough so it can be every man for himself . And unlucky he who gets the hind tit of the sow . But surely he will bring many Scotsmen with him . ... I have heard that . And have heard an answer to it , too  --  that he has in Scotland a small and shabby Court . And , sir , I can attest to that , having been there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For another time . Pray continue . ... The first reason , then , is that he has such a meager , shabby Court . Which , even if he brought them all and gave away Scotland to the Danes or the Irish or , perish the thought , to the Wild Scots of the North , still would be lost here among us . But the men of Court are willing to wager he would want to be rid of many of both old dogs and old fleas . They wager that he , too , is desirous of a new and clean beginning . . .. And the second good reason is this . It has been a long time in England since there has been a second Court . Not sincep401our grandparents . But this King of Scotland and his Queen keep separate Courts . And soon the eldest son , the young Prince Henry , upon whom much hope is laid , will be old enough for a Court of his own . In England he will be Prince of Wales . Which means that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorb ambition . And to offer offices and rewards . A miraculousmultiplication like the loaves and the fishes . . . . Moreover , a third reason that he seems to be favored is that his own Succession is clear . With children , with two sons of his own , we would find ourselves spared the worry that has troubledso many . Are there doubts about the Scot ? . . . They wonder at his nature . Whether , from what they have ascertained , he may prove to be a vengeful ruler . You are thinking of his mother  --  the Queen of Scots ? . . . Yes , and other matters . The Earl of Essex . Was he not a favorite of the King 's , in a fashion ? . . . Perhaps . Here he eyes you closely . He 's not drunk yet . Nor so at ease as to be free of suspicion . There seems to be a measure of doubt concerning the King 's religion . . . . Protestant , sir , though of what shade no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised an exemplary Protestant . Yet it is also told by Scots as well as Englishmen , that the King is tolerant of all Papists . Except for seditious Jesuits . Too good to be true ? . . . Where were we before we became so uncautious as to talk of things which are none of our affair ? Country and city , I believe . He continues with a catalogue of country holidays as they are practiced in London , relishing ( as well he might on a chilly evening ) the warmth of May Day and Midsummer Eve . Which leads him surely to recollections of happy village days . . . . Lord , we had times then ! On holidays you forgot all troublesand were glad to be alive . You set your face attentively . Put your head at an angle for easy and timely nodding . Keeping your eyes fixed on his . **28;10453;TOOLONG an infinity of pleasant convolutions . There were whole valleys on tributaries , each with many thousand well-tended gardens . Towns along the banks were entirely subsumed in their devotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one portion of one century in which they enjoyed a seemingly endless spell of clear weather . There were old opera houses , great estates , hidden root cellars and spring enclosures , gray churches built by the Dutch , wharves that stretched a mile into the river and were hung on some days with dozens of sturgeoneach of four hundred pounds or more and bursting with roe . The skating was unparalleled , except perhaps in Holland , for the early Dutch had built several hundred miles of canals through wilderness , swamp , field , and village , upon which a skater could glide all alone under the moonlight for a long winter 's night , and hardly know that he had been out ten minutes . Often boys or girls would come home in the blare of early morning , after a night of racing the moon , having fallen deeply in love . On the Hudson , infatuation was a great and complicated phenomenon . It was sometimes ridiculous and endearing : that is , to see adolescents caught painfully in the pleasant traps into which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to themselves . " I love you , " they would say to the imagined beloved , though it might have appeared to someone else that they were speaking to a snow shovel or an egg crate . The valley seemed to have run on love . But , luckily , commerce and farming were richly endowed , and the seasons were intense and fruitful ( ice and maple sugar in the winter ; shellfish and flowers in the spring ; vegetables , grain , and berries in summer ; everything at fall harvest ; and lumber , minerals , whale products , beef , mutton , wool , and manufactures all yearround ) , for if they were not , there would have been chaos . On the Hudson , there was always the opportunity to be educateddeeply in the heart . The beauty of the landscape did the rest , along with the magic of the moon , the river 's hot and reedy bays , the glittering silver ice , days of summer or days of snow submerged in an ocean of clear blue air , fields never-ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the south.  |p201THE  water of the Lake of the Coheeries was as lush and blue as the water of a round and opalescent glacial pool . Its plentiful fish were full of silvery fight ( rising above the lake like flashing swords ) , and they fled from place to place in a spectral bath of intense and unvaryingfidelity . It could be angry and brutal in storms , and drinking from it was an awakening and a blessing . And sometime not too deep in winter , each year , the Lake of the Coheeries would surprise everyoneby freezing over during the night . In the second week of Decemberat the latest , the inhabitants of Lake of the Coheeries Town sat by their fires after dinner and stared into the darkness around their rafters as Canadian winds rode in hordes and attacked their settlementfrom the north . These winds had been born and raised in the arctic , and had learned their manners on the way down , in Montreal  --  orso it was said , since the people of Lake of the Coheeries had n't much respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripped off tiles , broke branches , and toppled unwired chimneys . When they came up , everyone knew that winter had begun , and that a long time would pass before the spring made the lake light yellow with melting streams that fled from newly breathing fields . But one winter the winds were harder and colder than they had ever been . The night they started had seen birds smashed against cliffs and trees , children crying , and candles flickering . Mrs. Gamely , her daughter Virginia , and Virginia 's infant , Martin , stayed in their tiny house and imagined pure hell on the lake . They could hear huge waves breaking against the soft wiglike tufts where the fields met the water . In the middle of the lake , said Mrs. Gamely , the water was being blown into giant foamy castles , and all the great monsters from the deep , including the Donamoula , were being ploughed up and turned over like roots in a new field . " Listen , " she said . " You can hear them shrieking as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a cross between seaborne spiders , writhing serpents , and the sharpest knives ; even though their eyes are big and open and have no eyelashes , and they stare at you like cockeyed beggars ; and even though their teeth are a forest of bony razors , still , it 's a shame to hear them crying like that . " Virginia fastened onto the darkness , listening for the shrieks of sea creatures being tossed like a salad in the middle of the lake . Allp202she heard was the wind . Mrs. Gamely rolled her tiny eyes and held up one finger . " Shh , " she said , and listened . " There ! Hear them ? " " No ! " answered Virginia . " I hear only the wind . " " But do n't you hear the creatures , too , Virginia ? " " No , Mother , only the wind . " " I 'll bet the little warmkin hears them , " Mrs. Gamely said , referring to the baby sleeping soundly in its fat flannels . " There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've seen them . When I was a little girl on the north side of the lake ( way before I married Theodore ) , we used to see them all the time . Of course , that was long ago . They ran in schools , and came to the shore near the house , just like tame dogs . Sometimes they would leap over the dock , and sink a rowboat . My sister and I used to stand on the pier and feed them pies . They loved pies . The Donamoula , who was about two hundred feet long and fifty feet around , loved cherry pies . We would throw the cherry pie into the air , and he would catch it with his forty-foot tongue . One day , my father decided that this was too dangerous , and he made us stop . The Donamoula never came by after that . " She knitted her brows . " I wonder if he would remember me . " Ever challenged by her mother 's unorthodox views , Virginia thought of a means to answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her mother and was pleased and amazed by the sly , robust intelligence in the old woman 's face , by her massive form which was neither fat nor tall nor thick , by the large strong hands , the shapeless velvet and muslin dress with a green yoke , the two sweet little eyes set close together in a glowing cheeky face topped with a haystack of soft white hair , and the purring white rooster ( his comb was mandarin red ) that she held in her arms and occasionally stroked . " If Jack went away for fifty years " Jack was the rooster , Quebec-born , originally Jacques  --  " and then came back , would he recognizeme ? " Virginia asked . " Roosters do n't live for fifty years , Virginia . And besides , he would go back to Canada and probably never return . They speak French there , you know , and can never do anything right . They would probably turn him into a cocoa van , or use him as a mold for a weather vane . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away for fifty years and then come back . " " Okay . But where would he go ? " " To Peru . " " Why Peru ? " Conversations like these , touching on every subject known to man , would often usurp a good part of the night . Mrs. Gamely had never learned to read or write , and used her daughter as a scribe , and as a researcher among encyclopedias , questioning her at length about everything she found . The old woman 's sense of organization was a miracle of randomness as illogical and rich as the branches of a blossomingfruit tree . She could easily discuss 150 subjects in an hour and a half , and Virginia would still finish awed and enlightened by what seemed to be a relentless and perfect plan . Though Mrs. Gamely was by all measures prescientific and illiterate , she did know words . Where she got them was anyone 's guess , but she certainly had them . Virginia speculated that the people on the north side of the lake , steeped in variations of English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tool with which to garden a perfect landscape . Those who are isolated in small settlementsmay not know of the complexities common to great cities , but their hearts are rich , and so words are generated and retained . Mrs. Gamely 's vocabulary was enormous . She knew words no one had ever heard of , and she used words every day that had been mainly dead or sleeping for hundreds of years . Virginia checked them in the Oxford dictionary , and found that ( almost without exception ) Mrs. Gamely 's usage was flawlessly accurate . For instance , she spoke of certain kinds of dogs as Leviners . She called the areas near Quebec march-lands . She referred to diclesiums , liripoops , rapparees , dagswains , bronstrops , caroteels , opuntias , and soughs . She might describe something as patibulary , fremescent , pharisaic , Roxburghe , or glockamoid , and words like mormal , jeropigia , endosmic , mage , palmerin , thos , vituline , Turonian , galingale , comprodor , nox , gaskin , secotine , ogdoad , and pintulary fled from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sow 's ear , because Virginia spent inordinate proportions of her days racing through it , though when Mrs. Gamely was angry a " staff of ten could not have kept pace with her , and halfp204a dozen linguaphologists would have collapsed from hypercardia . " Where did you learn all those words , Mother ? " Virginia might ask . Mrs. Gamely would shrug her shoulders . " We were raised with them , I suppose . " She did n't always speak incomprehensibly . In fact , she sometimes went for months at a time strapped down firmly to a strong and worthy matrix of Anglo-Saxon derivatives . Then , Virginiabreathed easy , and the rooster was so happy that had he been a chicken he would have laid three eggs a day . Or was he a chicken ? Who knows ? The point is , he thought he was a cat . The wind rose even more , leveling haystacks , collapsing barns , driving the lake onto the fields . Mrs. Gamely and Virginia could hear a ferocious jingling as billions of ice fragments shuffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the insects that had ever lived . The house groaned and swayed , but it had been built to weather storms , and was the work of Theodore Gamely , who , before he had been killed , had intended it to shelter his wife and daughter no matter what might happen to him . Now his youthful wife was an old woman , the daughter in her thirties ; and they had been in the house alone for all that time , except when Virginia went off to marry a French-Canadian named Boissy d'Anglas , and came back three years later with a newborn son . " Do you think the house will fall down ? " asked Mrs. Gamely . " No , I do n't think so , " Virginia answered . " I 've never known the wind to blow like this . The coming winteris going to be very difficult . " " It 's always difficult . " " But this time , " said the mother , " I think the cold is going to break the back of the land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will get sick . " In combination with the wind , such pronouncements sounded accurate . In fact , whenever Mrs. Gamely spoke solemnly , she was usually right . Whether or not what she predicted would come true , that night the wind reached almost two hundred miles an hour , and the temperature of the still air was minus five degrees Fahrenheit . After an unusually bone-shaking blast , Mrs. Gamely got up and paced in circles about the center of the room . Wood burned in thep205stove , hot and bright . She circled the kitchen table , face upturned to the ceiling . Up there , it was a swirling purple , while the walls and floors were the color of warm rose , cream , and yellow . The roof rattled . Jack jumped into Mrs. Gamely 's arms , and she held him like a cat . " Is there snow , Mother ? " Virginia asked , almost as if she were still a child . " Not in this wind , " replied Mrs. Gamely . She threw some more wood into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double-barreledshotgun . She said that , on a night of great cold , bonds break , prisons open , lunatics are pushed over the brink , animals go berserk , and the monsters in the lake might try to come into the house . They sat there all night , not bothering to go to bed . Although Christmas was some weeks off , it felt like Christmas Eve , and Virginiaswayed slightly back and forth with her baby in her arms , dreaming and remembering . Their house was stocked with enough dry wood for two winters , and the pantry was packed up to the ceiling with smoked meats , fowl , and cheeses ; dried beef and vegetables ; sacks of rice , flour , and potatoes ; canned goods ; preserves ; local wine ; and things that the two women needed for their prodigiousskills in cooking and baking . The shelf was filled with books that were hard to read , that could devastate and remake one 's soul , and that , when they were finished , had a kick like a mule . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as light as whipped cream and three feet thick . Virginia had had some difficult times , and there would undoubtedly be more hard times ahead . But now she was home , in a bay of tranquillity , and it was pleasant just to dream . Canada : the name itself was as flat and cool as a snow-covered field . It took Virginia and Boissy d'Anglas two days on his sleigh to get to the Laurentians , and what pleasure to watch the moon swell up from the horizon amid the gaps between snow-bound trees . Her years in Canada were difficult to recall , but the memory of the journeythere was clear , and all she really needed . They started out one afternoon , when the sun was low and gold . The snow that day had been warmer than the air , and had shone with a yellowish glow like that of evening light against a brick wall . Two horses , one brown and one nearly red , had pulled north into thep206wilderness at an even canter which they might have sustained forever , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveled as if in daylight , thanks to a blinding moon reflected by the snow . The horses loved the fresh track before them , and ran across open fields and between stands of pine as if they were racing . Boissy d'Anglas and the young woman that he had nearly abducted were possessed . Their faces were on fire and their eyes were alight . Minute by minute , shadows were transformed into mountains or groves as they closed upon them and could see the winter-etching in ledges and leaves . Lakes and leaping streams appeared and disappeared on both sides of the road , and as they took the hills and curves the landscape seemed to roll as if it were the ocean . The perfectly round and frozen moon was as bright as ice . The horses were so happy to be running under the aurora that they probably could have gone all the way to Canada without stopping . But they were made to halt when they arrived at the edge of a frozen lake that stretched north like a highway between lines of hills and jagged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if we should camp here and start out tomorrow , or drive until the horses drop . This is the road we follow for two hundred miles . If I set them off within the hour , they 'll die sooner than not finish . " " Can you sleep ? " Virginia asked , implying that she could not . " Do you think the horses could sleep ? " " No , " he said , snapping the reins , and , as the sleigh thudded onto the snow-covered surface of the lake , they were off . They crossed rivers , railroads , and roads ; they passed lighted settlements and whining mills ; they penetrated high cold forests , lighting their way with lanterns when the moon was obscured by the trees . Virginia did not know if she were on the sleigh , racing through a freezing and dark pine forest and dreaming of home , or at home by the fire , dreaming of how she had once been taken up completely by the muffled pounding of horses ' hooves on the snow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to a sick and feverish child  --  slowly , overheated , and stale . Mrs. Gamely threw open the door and looked out . As a cold river of blue air came to redeem the hot room , she said , " Not one flake of snowp207fell in all that wind . What good was it ? All it did was steal away the heat and make us burn a lot of wood . " " What about the lake ? " Virginia asked . " The lake ? " " Did the lake freeze ? " Mrs. Gamely shrugged her shoulders . Virginia got up and put on a quilted jacket . The baby was placed gently into a cocoon of the same stuff , and they went down to the lake . Even before they rounded the corner of the house , they knew that the lake had frozen , for they heard no lapping or breaking waves , and the wind was even and shrill instead of being divided into a hundred different sounds , like birdsong , as it hit the whitecaps . The lake had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter was due . Just how difficult it would get could be forecast by the smoothness of the ice . The finer it was , the harder would be the succeeding months , although  --  in the days before it snowed  --  iceboatingwould be unlike anything on earth . Mrs. Gamely had seen the lake in its smooth state before , but never like this . It lay there almost laughing at its own perfection . There was not a ripple , streak , or bubble to be seen . The terrible wind and the incessant castellations of foam had been banished and leveled by the fast freeze of heavy blue water . Not a flake of snow skidded across the endless glass , which was as perfect as an astronomer 's mirror . " The monsters must be sealed in tight , " Mrs. Gamely said . Then she grew silent in contemplation of the winter to come . The ice was airless , smooth , and dark . Fox two weeks the sun rose and set on Lake of the Coheeries Town , low and burnished , spinning out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle breeze moved from west to east on the lake , sweepingthe flawless black ice clean in a continuous procession of chatteringicicles and twigs that fled from wind and sun like ranks of opera singers who run from their scenes gaily and full of energy in a stage direction stolen from streams , surf , and the storms which fleece autumnalforests.  |p208Even  though the air temperature never went above ten degrees , the weather was mild because the wind was light and the sky cloudless . With their wells freezing up and their world nearly still , the inhabitants of the town took to the ice in a barrage of Dutch pursuits that saw the sun rise and set , and gave the village the busy and peculiar appearance of a Flemish winter scene . Perhaps they had inheritedit ; perhaps the historical memory deep within them , like the intense colors with which the landscape was painted , was renewable . A Dutch village arose along the lake . Iceboats raced from west to east and tacked back again , their voluminous sails like a hundred flowers gliding noiselessly across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight sound as gleaming steel runners made their magical cut . A little way in the distance , they sounded like a barely audible steam engine . Miniature villages sprang up on the lake , comprised of fishingbooths ranged in circles , with flapping doors and curling pigtails of smoke from stovepipe chimneys . Firelight from these shelters reflectedacross the ice at night in orange and yellow lines that each came to a daggerlike point . Boys and girls disappeared together , on skates , pulled into the limitless distance by a ballooning sail attached to their thighs and shoulders . When they had traveled so far on the empty mirror that they could see no shore , they folded the sail , put it on the ice , and lay on its tame billows to fondle and kiss , keeping a sharp eye on the horizon for the faraway bloom of an iceboat sail , lest they be discovered and admired to death by the younger children who sailed boats into the empty sections just to see such things . Blazing fires on shore ringed inward bays and harbors like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or rum and cider , and venison roasting on a spit . Skating on the lake in darkness , firing a pistol to keep in touch with a friend , was like traveling in space , for there were painfully bright stars above and all the way down to a horizon that rested on the lake like a bell jar . The stars were reflected perfectly , though dimly , in the ice , frozen until they could not sparkle . Long before , someone had had the idea of laying down wide runners , setting the **29;10483;TOOLONG village bandstandon them , and hitching up a half-dozen plough horses with ice shoes to tow the whole thing around at night . With lights shining from the shell , an entire enchanted village skated behind it as thep209Coheeries orchestra played a lovely , lucid , magical piece such as " Rhythm of Winter , " by A. P. Clarissa . When the farmers all along the undulating lakeshore saw a chain of tiny orange flames , and the shining white castle moving dreamlike through the dark ( like a dancer making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their skates and pogoed through their fields to leap onto the ice and race to the magic that glided across the horizon . As they approached , they were astonished by the music , and by the ghostly legions of men , women , and children skating in the darkness behind the bandshell . They looked like the unlit tail of a comet . Young girls twirled and pirouetted to the music : others were content just to follow . This carnival used up much of the stored reserves of firewood , food , supplies , and feed . It was a foolish thing to do , but the people of Lake of the Coheeries were not able to ignore the perfect weather , which got them rolling at fever pitch . They were careless and crazy . Squandering their gains in the relaxation of their souls , they danced , they sang , and they damned the hard winter to come , affirming their trust in nature by following to the letter its paradoxical orchestrations . Even Mrs. Gamely , a paragon of conservation , gave freely of her stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fearless baking of a hundred pies . She and Virginia skated behind the bandshell . They danced on the shore in marvelous , civilized , humorous reels in which the old contributed wit when they could not contribute grace , and the young listened to their elders , who told them in their dancing to hold on , to love , to be patient , and , most of all , to trust . No one could be blind to this lesson after seeing Mrs. Gamely , a widow upon whom the years had come down hard , dancing and laughing on the soft shore , or even on the ice . B Y the middle of January , no one had enough food . They were stretching it out , hoping that it might last until summer ( which was impossible ) , and everyone was disastrously fat and unhealthy from the wild eating in December . " The icicles have come home to roost , " declared Mrs. Gamely , slightly subdued , but not yet melancholy . " The way I figure it , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , " we have enough food to last until about March.  |p210So  what . March is cold . Lamston Tarko and his dog froze to death on the last day of March , thirty seven . How are we going to eat ? That 's the question . " " Do n't the other villages have food that they can give us ? " asked Virginia . " No . Their harvests were ruined by hail . Ours were n't , and we did so well that we gave them enough to survive on . We did n't even sell it , we gave it . But now we 're all on the same goat . The way the wind blows in winter , no one will come to help . Besides , we 've always done for ourselves . I wish Antoine Bonticue were here . He could think of something , and so might have Theodore . " " Who was Antoine Bonticue ? " " He died before you were born . He used to live between Coheeriesand the march-lands . He was Swiss , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Swiss and he went around in a spider cart ? " repeated Virginia . " Yes , " said Mrs. Gamely . " Spider carts are wonderful . They 're very quiet , and you ca n't drive them on busy roads , because the spiders tend to get crushed . They 're also somewhat slow , but they 're quite economical , especially for light loads . As you might be able to tell from his name , Antoine Bonticue weighed less than a hundred pounds . He was some sort of engineer , and he used to stretch cables and pulleys from one place to another . Evidently , rigging cables is therapy for the Swiss : or part of their theology . What was it that he used to say ? ' A balanced arc between mountain rows / as servant to his master shows / the power of besieged belief / in something somethingsomething , something something something  --  something to do with ducks , or rainbows . ' " Theodore would know what to do . We will , too . After all , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slicing off a chunk of smoked beef , spilling upon the table half a pound of dried corn , and grating some hard cheese into a small pile of dairy sawdust . A pur " e of these three things went to feed the baby . The rest became a kind of landlocked bouillabaisse into which dill brought its springlike scent and red pepper was shaken until the dish that they cooked had enough life top211attack them as they devoured it . The sting was satisfying , but the two women were left hungry . What will we do in March ? they wondered . That night , perhaps because it was already the fifth night that they had gone to bed hungry , the answer came to Virginia in a dream that was served up as richly and elegantly as hotel food that lives deep inside booming silver domes and rides from place to place on noiseless carts . She dreamed of spring in a great city of fuming gray squares and whited sepulchers , of bending willows , and rivers that turned up their spring bellies in wind-flaked sapphire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squares in a weave of streets like a basket of nested snakes , a city of smooth silk hats and cool gray coats , of silent music played on flashing cloud light , of delirious green trees , of stores that led to secret tunnels , of clear days , and crystal palaces , and endless portraits ever arising . This city became alive , and was her lover . She took it without inhibition , grappling with it breathlesslyand nude . She sweated , rolled her closed eyes , and sawed back and forth from thigh to thigh , as it overwhelmed her with its surging colors . The dream taught her that cities are not unlike huge animals which eat , sleep , work , and love . It taught her what it was like for something as massy and giant as a whale to make love unbraced in the gravityless blue ocean . And it taught her that her future ( she had always known that her future was in her , waiting to be shaken out ) was in the city , and that she would spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dream . When she awakened she was still half dreaming and still wet from her extraordinary labor , but she calculated immediately that , if she were to go away with the baby , Mrs. Gamely would have more than enough upon which to survive , and might even help someone else . Mrs. Gamely 's initial opposition was silenced by the beauties and accuracies of the recounted dream . " Though I have n't ever been there , " Virginia said , " I seem to have known it all well enough to have created it . " To Virginia 's surprise , Mrs. Gamely did not bring up the misfire with Boissy d'Anglas . Instead , she grew as excited asp212a follower of a lost cause who sees in her old age the possibility that the cause may revive and succeed . They embraced a thousand times before Virginia left , and it made them cry each time . The last thing Mrs. Gamely said to her daughter was , " Remember , what we are trying to do in this life is to shatter time and bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the whole world . " Virginia did not know exactly what her mother had meant . THE lake was covered with snow by the time Virginia and her baby rode along its length in a huge troika pulled by horses heavy enough to shake even the thick ice of the Lake of the Coheeries as they pounded down the snow road . By afternoon , they were in the mountains , ascending steadily , turning on hairpin terraces from which they could see a world of white and blue . Now and then a snowy hawk rose from the background camouflage of glistening bone-white fields , and navigated the ocean of air , slipping sideways on the wing more gracefully than a skater . As they neared the top of the range , they watched the effects of high winds upon the accumulated drifts . Powerful continental gusts burst upon cornices and sculptured ridges , sending up vertical jets of loosed snow . Behind these white silk curtains were glowing rims of gold where the sun shone through their crests . There was so much screaming and whistling that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleigh driver halted on a round cakelike knob , the summit . Resting there , they saw a landscape of ice and snow crossed and covered by hills and ridges from which white powder rocketed into the air . The horses dipped their heads and shook their ice-encrusted manes . " From here on , " said the sleigh driver , shouting with difficultythrough his muffler and the blasts of mountain air , " you ca n't see the lake , but only the east and , soon , the Hudson . Take one last look , for we are now on our way to a different place . " The road led not through fields and past overlooks , but deeper and deeper within an untouched forest , between rock cliffs a thousand feet high , near ice-covered gorges where falls and flumes pounded like jackhammers and covered hundred-foot oaks in freezing spray.  |p213They  glided over dimly lit roads , springing upon shocked families of deer that had an air of offended innocence , and which they sent whitetailedinto the forest , carrying their solid six-foot horns like little battleaxes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They drove through vaulted mahogany-colored courses made by trees and snow , and the horses leapt ahead , swallowing the space in front of them and effortlessly compressing the air of the cool snow tunnels . Virginia held her baby to her , inside her coat . His name , for the moment anyway , was Martin d'Anglas , which seemed very apt for a swordsman who swung on ropes , or a legionnaire , and much less apt for a little newt all wrapped up in blue . His mouth and nose stuck out of a navy cashmere balaclava , and he took the cold air like a puppy . Virginia threw back her head to look for hawks and eagles , and was surprised at the many she saw perched in gothic nests high in the trees . They watched , unconcerned , as the troika slipped past . " Look at all those dignified eagles up there , " she said to the driver . " If they did n't look like they were made of porcelain and gold , I would swear that they were justices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long gradual slope led to the riverbank , and they came down it just at dusk , to an inn by the Hudson . Pigs huddled together in the yard , singing for the innkeeper to let them into the pig quarters for the night . Muffins of pure white smoke emerged from the chimney . Virginia and Martin ( she had already begun to pronounce the name in English ) would stay until early morning , when a giant iceboatthat could hold half a dozen passengers and their luggage would take them downriver as far as the open channel , where they would get a boat south . In the middle of the night , the innkeeper 's wife  --  a woman with cheeks redder than the rash that sometimes appeared on Martin 's two tiny hams  --  knocked on the door . Virginia switched on the light . She was uncomfortable from a lush and tremendous dinner of lambchops , cornbread , and dandelion salad . The light glared at her , and , in response to its rays , Martin began to punch with his springy little arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is it ? " she asked . " Sorry to wake you , dear , " said the innkeeper 's wife with a voice that had I ived many years in a crock of mint jelly , " but Mr. Fteleyp214just got a telephone call from Oscawana . The iceboat 's not running , something about the drifts of snow , so you 'll have to skate down there tomorrow , first thing . The cutter will wait until noon . If you leave at eight , you should make it in plenty of time . Mr. Fteley will pull a sled with the luggage . " " I see , " said Virginia . " How many miles is it from here to Oscawana ? " " Just twenty , " answered Mrs. Fteley , " and the wind will be at your back . " " Oh , " said Virginia , as Mrs. Fteley disappeared . She turned off the light , and then fell asleep within five seconds . She dreamed of skating , and ( as so often happened ) the next morning she found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours and hours , she skated nearly in a trance , centered between the mountain banks , on a road of white ice . She was one of those women whose legs seem to come up to everyone else 's shoulders . It would have been impossible to keep her in jail , since , no matter how far across the room the jailer hung his key she would have been able to hook the ring around a toe and bring it to her with one sinuous fold of thigh and calf . So she was a natural speed skater . One long push was good for fifty yards : and she could push for hours . She was only five eleven , but her figure was perfect . Her hair was blue-black , as glistening as the thick pelt of a healthy seal . She had a perfectly formed white smile that was soft , inviting , and full of power . She was not quite as arresting in photographs as she was in the flesh , for her beauty was sprung directly from her soul , and proved that physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor was she beautiful in a coy sense , either . When she was severe , she looked severe . When she was angry , she looked angry . With Martin bundled up and riding on her back , she skated downriver , rounding its curling bends and keeping her eyes upon the converging shorelines and ice . She would stop every now and then and put Martin in front of her , kneeling to check on him . He was so well wrapped that he slept as if he were at home in a cradle . Then she would hoist him up and begin again , more and more powerfully.  |p215Though  the wind was at her back , she was going fast enough so that her hair was pushed from her face . Behind her at a distance of a mile or so came Mr. Fteley , the innkeeper , pulling a light sled . They traveled silently past sleeping settlements of red brick and slattern wood . At a bend in the river , near Constitution Island , Virginia saw an icehouse in which she decided to rest and escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop just before the dock , the silver blades of her skates sending up an abrupt shower of fresh-milled crystals that hung in the air and sparkled . Around the side of the building was an entrance bay for boats and sleds , through which she glided into the dark interior , expelling half a dozen frightened sparrows . It was full of hay and templed blocks of ice in glassy walls that reached up to the roof beams . She was much warmer away from the wind , and she glowed from her exercise . She swung Martin around and unwrapped him . He was awake and smiling , as if he were in on a wonderful joke . Perhaps he was happy because his mother was radiant in the darkness , her cold reddened face central to the scheme of symmetrical light that came through the cracks in the walls . As the blood coursed through her , it brought with it lucidity , equanimity , and a light pounding rhythm that set the baby up and had probably made him smile . While she fed him she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head back to stare into the darkness , , where the birds lived , beyond the ice blocks . Long before , in the most severe winter the Coheeries had ever known ( until the one they were in ) the farmers had cut ice from the Lake of the Coheeries and filled an icehouse on the lakeshore not far from where the Gamelys lived . There was so much of it that it remained , underneath fresh ice cut in subsequent years , for half a century . Then the icehouse was sold to a man who wanted it for a printing shop , and no one put any more ice in it . Soon the old ice was reached , and one summer , when Virginia was six or seven , she was playing near the blocks that had been recently uncovered after half a hundred years . The unrelenting heat that had driven her inside the icehouse was melting these veteran glass bricks and creating little rivers of fresh water . Virginia thought that she was alone . She pressed her palms up against a melting slab full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had warned her to stay out of the icehouse , because it was full of terrible dangers . " The Donamoula comes into the icehouse at night , " Mrs. Gamely had said , " to chew on blocks of ice and slap his tongue against the salt . If he sees you there , " she told the rapt little girl , " he might think that you are an hors d'oeuvre . Stay out of the icehouse ! " Though afraid of the Donamoula , Virginia had wanted nonethelessto see him , and maybe even to ride him across the lake , like a torpedo . The way Mrs. Gamely described him , it was a safe bet to warrant that even if he did eat little girls , it was only by mistake . Anyway , she moved about with the stiffness peculiar to children who imagine that they are being observed by sea monsters or things that live under the bed at night , and every once in a while she would glance toward the lake door to see if the Donamoula had arrived . Just when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percussive , wet , sudden , fishy slap . She would not have moved , could not have moved , for all the blueberries in the Adirondacks . Again , the same fishy slap , met this time in the cold mysteriousair by yet another , of lower pitch . Dizzy with fear , Virginia moved her head a quarter-turn . No Donamoula . She looked around , convinced that she was about to be encoiled by the swift forty-foot tongue that could catch a cherry pie the way a darter newt catches a bloime bug . No Donamoula , and yet the sounds kept coming  --  slap slap , quasha , flaship , swipa , spatch ! As her fear subsided she realized that the noise was coming from atop the pyramid of ice . She climbed up , numbing her hands and knees . At the summit , near the hottest space under the eaves , not far from a summer sunray that had broken through a rotted shake and shot down in a tight yellow beam , was a little blue lake of newly melted fifty-year-old ice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before she was born , had been frozen still , and had now come to life and were smashing their flippant tails in protest and joy . They were silver and gold , and their eyes looked like wise old rainbows . Virginia remembered the intense unmatchable pleasure of taking the two shad by their twitching scaly tails and carrying them down the pyramid so that she could toss them , in the most beautiful ,  |p217airborne  , moment of their lives , into the lake , where they vanished in the dark water  --  perhaps to tell their tale to the other fish and refresh the population with the intricate mystery of youth in age , and age in youth . Magic , she knew , was all about time , and could stop it and hold it for the inquisitive eye to look through as if through cold and splendid ice . She shifted her gaze from the darkness to the white glare floodingthrough the doorway . For a fraction of a second , Mr. Fteley appeared in the opening , panting along in front of the sled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went onto her back , and out she flew from the icehouse , like a racehorse from the start , chasing after Mr. Fteley . She was in a fine mood when , in a confusion of wind that whipped their scarves in all directions , she caught him . Shouting now over the anarchic wind  --  they were in a widening bay  --  she said , " Mr. Fteley , why ca n't the iceboat make it upriver ? The ice is smooth and thick . I do n't understand . " " The drift wall , " shouted Fteley . " The what ? " " The drift wall ! " he shouted again . " By pure coincidence , it snowed all in one place just north of Oscawana , and then the wind piled it up in a wall across the ice . It blocks the river completely , as sure as my name is Fteley , from shore to shore as high as the hills on both banks . They ca n't tunnel through because they fear it will collapseas it melts . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he shouted over the wind . " As high as the surrounding hills ? " " Yes . " " How high are they ? " " A thousand feet , " he screamed back . " We 'll have to climb it and slide down the other side . " When they rounded one of the alpine bends that made the HudsonHighlands look like a collection of looming rhinoceros horns , they saw the drift wall  --  which , unlike Rome , had sprung up in a day , and which had about it the smooth , thoughtless , malicious air of a modern skyscraper . The drift wall was a pile of snow that stretchedp218from mountain to mountain across the solidified river . It was steep , a thousand feet high , and shrouded at the top by a tumbling mist that devoured itself and regenerated , blooming like time-lapsed roses . " I ca n't climb that , " said Mr. Fteley , " not with this luggage , certainly . I thought it was lower , and did n't know about all that stuff at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fear , his eyes fixed on the long lateral summit . " Christ , " he said , " you may think that I 'm a chicken , but I 've got to consider Mrs. Fteley and my little Felicia . Why do n't you come back upriver and stay with us , free of charge , until the damn thing melts . It 'd be a mistake , miss , to try to climb that . " " Mr. Fteley , " said Virginia , her blood still hot from the skating and her heart still lively from the glory of resurrected colors that she had remembered in the dark icehouse , " I do n't think that you 're a chicken , I understand that you 've got to think of Mrs. Fteley and Felicia , and I certainly would n't ask you to climb that because of my luggage . So why do n't you go back , and send me my things wheneverthe iceboat can get through . Meanwhile , Martin and I will go over . " But , miss ! You 'll disappear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there 's nothing to clutch on to . You 'll tumble all the way down and die . " " Mr. Fteley , " said Virginia , her eyes full of lights , " the way I feel now , I could leap that wall in one jump . And if I climb it , as I will , I 'll go in one sure step after another , I wo n't be afraid , I wo n't fall back , and I will get to the other side . " " How can you know that ? How can you be sure ? " " Simple , " she said , " I 've seen myself there . " " You 've been over already ? " he asked , somewhat confused . " No . " " You 've imagined then . That 's different . That 's a cat flying after a bird . " " No , I have n't imagined . I 've seen . That 's no cat flying after a bird . " " What do you mean , you 've seen ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You 're crazy ! " he said , with an aggressive , nasty lurch . " Youp219ca n't see the future . You ca n't feel the future . People like you end up in loony bins . It just does n't cut . " " Like hell , Mr. Fteley , " answered Virginia , quite angry that she had been attacked for giving an honest answer . " It cuts . And I 'll get to the other side . " Then she grew even angrier , and turned on him for the way in which he was looking at her . " The world is full of leaden slugs like you , innkeeper , who are afraid of the powers of the heart . You hope that mountain climbers and acrobats fall , that daring bridges collapse , that those who can feel the future be punished . If everyone were like you , Mr. Fteley , we 'd still be in hides and skins . Hides and skins . Go back to the inn . Cook up some farina . Put your spittoon on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because Martin and I are going to the city . " With that , she turned away from the innkeeper and began climbing . She found that by means of a chain of small steps driven into the dense snow , she soon was high above the ground , like a worker on the face of a dam . Had she fallen backward , she and Martinwould have gone through the ice like a cannonball , never to be seen again . But she did n't look back , the left foot was always forward , she breathed calmly , and she concentrated . In an hour she was nearly at the top , standing vertically in the holds she had dug in the snow , with hands and fingers stuck in as deep as she could push them and spread as wide as she could spread them to get a grip . Sleeping peacefully on her back , Martin was suspended a thousand feet above the ice . Down below , Mr. Fteley was running back and forth like an ant ; amazed , afraid , and angry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the drift wall . Unfortunately , it leaned out . To get over it and into the curtain of mist , she would have to climb while leaning back . How ? The snow was hard to hold . She imagined herself and Martin falling , and , as she did , she felt her previously strong hold loosening . Then it occurred to her that she could reverse that effect , and she tried to do so . She imagined herself sticking to the wall , proceeding with surety and grace , losing not a second of her momentum . When she had become agitated with that vision , she made her move , punching holes in the compressible snow while saying to herself , " Go ! go ! " and she moved up and out . She did hang outward for a few seconds , but her momentum took care ofp220her and thrust her over the edge . Afterward , she thought she heard one long clear blast of a French horn , and realized that it was an illusion of her heart springing free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up by the mist . She found herself thrown about by gusts of wind and visible currents of whitened air that rushed at her from all directions . She did n't actually walk across the ridge , she was waltzed across by the turbulence  --  which occasionally picked her up and spun her upside down but always put her back again on her feet . In the end it simply spat her out on the other side , having treated her with unusual and uncharacteristic gentleness ( all because of the baby on her back , for whom allowances had to be made ) . Straightening her hair , she walked a few steps through the thinning mist , and then was in the clear again . There , fifty miles to the south , was the city . IT was another world  --  shadowy , white , and , above all , silent . The city 's silence , however , was only the solidification of all its countless sounds , fused by mass and distance . Against a background of viscous blue , towers rose like bone . Volumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , channeled and directed to a place unknown , where it would be received as a dense static , a hissing , a white noise , like surf . The light , too , would compress upon a distant shore . As steadily as a machine , the city signaled its existence in a spectrum of low thunder , with arms outstretched to the future , and memories of what lay ahead pulling it in omnipotent traction . The air was as clear as that over the Lake of the Coheeries , and yet there were within it distorting lenses that magnified and reduced entire coasts , rivers , and mountain ranges  --  without explanation and seemingly at will , but always with pleasing effect . Virginia found that she was able to enter the scene before her wherever she wanted , approaching closely to see its every detail . What most attracted her were the ways in which things moved . Seen from afar , they seemed to fit an overall pattern of which they appeared to be ( and must have been ) ignorant . Ships traveling on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward motion : it dogged them likep221magnetism , and could be felt as surely as the ship itself could be seen . The yaw and pitch of these vessels weaved invisible threads , as did the coding of the whitecaps ; the passage of clouds ; the very busy , mouselike galloping of traffic on distant expressways ; and the hemispherictracking of reflected light in jagged palisades of soaring glass . Down below , the ice was clean and white , a slab of enamel that did not seem cold . She saw the enormous iceboat pinned at its dock , and a line of people stretched from the loading pier to a big Hamilton-classcutter , stacks smoking lightly , which rested on the ice , frozen in . People were streaming on board to weight the cutter and smash the ice ways upon which it unwillingly lay . It was pointed like a compass needle , its orientation an appeal for the chance to hit blue water and steam through the Tappan Zee toward open ocean . Not even a child could have been more impatient , and , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful that it looked like a cross between a steam engine and a knife . As Virginia approached the cutter she noticed that the officers were pacing back and forth , upset that the weight of a thousand extra passengers and their baggage was not enough to break the prison of ice . She walked up a snow ramp to an open door in the hull . " We 've taken all the passengers we can , ma'am , " a young officer said to her . " There 's really no more room . " " But you 've taken on passengers in the first place to add more weight . Is n't that so ? " " Yes , ma'am , " said the officer , with an amused smile , " but one more person is n't going to make much of a difference . " He indicated the great size of the ship , and he did n't seem to care that Virginia and Martin would be left alone on the ice . In fact , he seemed to derive pleasure from his indifference . " Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin . Martin burped . " All right , " said the officer . " But you 're the last . " " I can see that , " Virginia said , looking about the empty ice . She put Martin on the snowbank , and jumped onto the ship . There was a creak in the ice that made everyone look up . " Just acoincidence , " the officer stated . Martin began to kick and scream . He did n't like being the onlyp222one not on the ark . " Now , now , " said his mother as she was about to pick him up and take him aboard . The officer had turned away to scold a young boy who was trying to fire a torpedo at Verplanck . As soon as Martin was lifted over the bulkhead and taken inboard , there was a sharp explosive crack and the ship settled into the river , sendingup thousands of tons of green water that washed over the ice like a tidal wave and froze by the time it reached shore . The passengers cheered . Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not lose the opportunity to address the officer . She cleared her throat and said , " We want to ride on the bridge , and lunch with the captain . We would like a five-ounce filet mignon , watercress salad , a baked potato , tea , a strawbery tart , and some gently warmed milk . " " And just who the hell are you ? " asked the officer , unaware of their role in the recent drama of physics . Rather than explain , Virginia took Martin aside and fed him herself , and then had the steaming oyster pan roast and hot buttermilkbread that had been offered to the passengers . She had learned her first lesson of the city , and she was unperturbed . Mrs. Gamely had a small book of paintings by the artists of New York and the Hudson , and when she leafed through its polished pages she felt much the same as some Lake of the Coheeries women felt when they were in church . As she looked at this holy book , she would often say things that Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guard officer  --  a man whose gold regalia on a rich navy coat made him look like a painting in motion  --  Virginiaunderstood , and she speculated that the city would be cold , completely of itself , unconscious , that its every move would be transcendent , and that each of its hundred million flashing scenes would strike a moral lesson . Such a city would extend vision , intensify pity , telescope emotion , and float the heart the way the sea is gently buoyant with great ships . To do this , it would have to be a cold instrument . And , despiteits beauty , it would have to be cruel . This was deeply bound within the book of images . Only they could explain it . Out of respect and love for her mother , Virginia had learned to regard paintings as something in which time wasp223shattered and light was understood , and to know the steadfast link between high emotions and beautiful images . She knew that the imagehad to be cold , because its task required silence and detachment in the presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized until now why it had to be cruel as well . The cruelty and coldness were almost physical forces . As they acted upon the heart , they made it rise and feel . They purified motives and tested the soul with uncompromising certainty . Images and people had to be strong enough to stand by themselves . For when they did , they had the capacity and power to be interlinked , and to serve . Virginia stood on deck for as long as she could . The ice-choked river ebbed and flowed from and against the staid sides of the ship , and the wind was like a grindstone of ice . Though he was trim for his age and was not coated with too much blubber , Martin was as warm and flexible as an Eskimo baby , and seemed completely impervious to the cold . In the end , she had to go inside because she was cold . He did n't mind the warm cabin , and as they sailed down the river he made bicycling motions with his legs and practiced facial gestures . Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the mountainous banks , trees bent and swayed in the sunny wind . Houses of stone and wood stood on hillsides crossed and bound by miles of neat dry-wall . Great oaks loomed over the river . In Croton Bay , the boys were playing hockey or speeding along the ice with makeshift sails that they had filched from their mothers ' linen closets . The hills of Ossining , and the streets that climbed them , seemed from the river to be sad and forgotten . Ossining was peculiar , and shoddy , too ( for it had become poor ) , but its steep streets , slate roofs , and massive oaks were portraits of beauty and honor . They passed Tarrytown and the Tappan Zee , where rolling jolly fields were the skirts to craggy thunderous mountains , and orchards came fearlessly to the base of cliffs . Sailing through a gap of pylons in the Tappan Zee bridge , the cutter 's black steelwork came near to coil iding with the high roadway but only saluted it with smoke . Half a mile south , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As soon as Virginia saw the gates of the shining city , and the white clouds sweeping over , she knew that she was meant to be there . Itp224did not draw people to it the way it did for nothing . It was God 's crucible , and she was on her way into it . Down they glided , they glided down , on the fast-flowing river that swept by the town . As they accomplished their nearly silent traverse , the setting sun made the glass palisades and gray towers a shield of gold . And as its light disappeared from all but the tips of spires which glowed like smoldering punks that children used to signal by , the city turned on its cool chemical lamps : a hundred million flashes , fires , altars , and hearths racked on mountainous towerswith castled tops  --  the whole masterpiece bullying Virginia in the insistent and gentle fashion of a good teacher . Next to this enormousharrow of gold and green , of shining ledges and needles , the ships tied up at North River piers looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look , Martin , " Virginia said , holding him so that he could see the whole thing , " . . . the golden city . " After ten miles of lights and towers , they pulled up at the fireboatpier on the Battery and the passengers of the cutter were dischargedinto the night . The officers wanted to speed them into the city so that they could take their ship beyond the Narrows for some real work amid white waves as tall as church steeples , and over a prairie of green troughs . The passengers passed through the wooden halls of the fireboat station and found themselves immediately face to face with teeming streets . Thus the country people were thrown into the city 's gaping mouth . VIRGINIA and Martin began to walk aimlessly through the cold . She had neither a plan nor the slightest idea of how to make her way , and by ten o'clock she found herself , exhausted and limp , leaning against a tile arch in Grand Central Station . Streams of people went by without noticing her , because , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . The several hours of walking in the cold had made her very hungry , and it was a fine coincidence that she was standing just outside the Oyster Bar , where rooms of happy diners deep underground ate frothy oyster stews or sizzling fish steaks while white-jacketed barmen served up clams and oysters on a productionp225line worthy of its finer , more anarchic , deeper-underground predecessors . Virginia pressed against a window and took all this in , but only with her eyes . Now and then , someone looked up and saw her . This was the heart of the city . In these marble corridors , beggar women roamed by the hundreds . Those who looked up would not look up for long . Virginia was about to turn away and wander , when she saw a young woman on the far side of the dining room rise and peer at her . Then the woman pointed , and asked silently , with gestures that were clear , " Is that you ? " Virginia looked behind her , as she often did when people called out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the other woman , who was wearing a green silk dress , began to wade through the crowded restaurant . Waiting for the green silk to duck under and then surface amid the arches , Virginia worried that , because she was tired , she must have looked terrible . But she was wrong . Even though she was slightly winter-frayed by the city , and had walked about too long without a hot drink and some moments of sitting down in a warm room , she still was painfully beautiful . And though cold and tired , she stood straight . When the woman in green emerged from the domes and tiles , Virginia saw a face that she recognized from the Lake of the Coheeries . It was Jessica Penn , a childhood friend from many summerspast . For several generations , the Penns had come to the Lake of the Coheeries each summer ( the men for weekends and Augusts , the women and children for an entire season ) to watch the light layer itself across the lake , to sit on the porch in world-shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming about once , to anchor in a cove of straight rock walls that no one had ever seen or would see again , to run through blue-green forests suspended in summer 's slow northern time , to come to know the faces , laughter , and eccentricities of those whose fate in life was to die and be halfrememberedby children . " Yes , " someone might say , fifty years later , " I think I remember Aunt Marjorie . She was the one who tied bells to the pet bear , showed us tricks with magnets , and baked ginger cookies . Or was that Aunt Helen ? " Virginia heard the sound of her oars as she rowed amid thep226reeds , a child in full summer . Shuddering like a crazed cymbal , the sun lighted the Lake of the Coheeries until it was as hot and as lightgreenas the banks of the Nile . Mrs. Gamely , a much younger woman , was calling down from the house , " Virginia . . . Virginia . . . Virginia . . . " , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia . . . Virginia , " she called , as the oars dipped in the dark water and Virginia rowed hard to return home . But , though once the oars had been dipped dreamlike into the dark water , the lake had turned to ice with the sadness of the passing years . One winter , very early on , Theodore Gamely took Virginia with him to inspect the Penn house . Neither water nor ice , the lake was impassable , and to get to the other side they went a long distance by sleigh and on skis , and traveled at times through tunnels in the high drifts . The Penns ' house was an empty ice palace of silent tortured rooms . Oriental rugs , summer furniture , National Geographics , fishingequipment , puzzles , and disconnected lamps huddled in the cold . Snow enveloped the house all the way up to its second-story windows and made it seem like a long-forgotten cave . As her father went from room to room checking for damage , Virginia stayed on the ground floor , trapped by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There they remained all winter , in their old-fashioned finery , still and forgotten , trying to come out of the paintings and embrace one another . When Theodore Gamely came down the stairs , satisfied that all was well , he found that his little daughter , bundled in her furs , was crying  --  because , she had said , the people in the paintings were dead , and they had to stay alone and apart in this cold room under the snow . But then her father picked her up and took her to each painting , recounting as best he could its history . He showed her old Isaac , whom she had loved very much because of his sad and gentle face , and because he was almost as small as a child ; he showed her Isaac Penn 's wife , Abigail , their sons Jack and Harry , and their daughters Beverly and Willa . " Harry is Jessica 's daddy , " he said . " He 's alive , is n't he ? " " Yes , " said Virginia , sniffling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young that she hardly remembered seeing Harry Penn a few times the previous summer.  | " And here , " said her father , " is Willa . Willa is alive , too . She lives in Boston . " " Who 's that ? " asked Virginia . They stepped forward a few paces in the gloom , and looked up at a high cold wall upon which hung a portrait of a young woman . " That 's Beverly , " said Theodore Gamely . " I remember her only vaguely . One night , a long time ago , I went on a sleigh ride with Beverly . We went very fast , faster I think than I have ever gone since . We stopped at an inn , where we played Duck Thumb . I was just a little boy : almost as young as you . " " And who was that ? " asked Virginia , pointing to a painting directly opposite the one of Beverly . " That , " her father answered , " is Peter Lake . He was the man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room ? They loved one another , but she died when she was young  --  I remember the summer when they came to the lake without her  --  and he disappearedforever . " Virginia seemed likely to cry again , so he said , " It 's true . Peopledie . That 's what happens . But think of the children . There 's Jessica , her cousin John , and the Penn children from Boston . You should n't be worrying about these things , little girl . " He brushed her hair from her forehead and kissed her . Then they left that freezing gallery , and Virginia would always remember the colorful spirits , floating about her in the half-light , as if she had known them . But though she remembered their stories , she could not recall their faces . Here , in another gallery , underground , was Jessica  --  like Virginia , a full-blown beauty , though the difference between city and country was profound and apparent . They were somewhat taken aback by the way in which they had aged , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resume the friendshipthey had had as young girls . Knowing this , they were restrained , though they could feel a certain new warmth between them , born of the mutual realization that they were not foolishly effusive , and had developed into dignified and intelligent presences unwilling to barter away what they had become , for a short-lived reminiscence that could not have been sustained.  |p228Martin  threw a reflexive punch at his mother 's friend , who then led both of them through the Oyster Bar to a large circular table , where Virginia sat down and was introduced , round robin , to Jessica'snumerous companions . It was a journalists ' dinner , and , among journalists , Praeger de Pinto ( though quite young ) was the most eminent . In addition to being managing editor of both The Sun and The Whale ( that is , The New York Evening Sun , and The New York Morning Whale ) , he was engaged to Jessica Penn , and was therefore the leader of the gang  --  though he would have been anyway . He knew just about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that much more . " You look like you 've had a hard journey , " he said . " I have . " " Have you come from the north ? " he asked , having heard of the refugees occasioned by the amazing snows and stunning cold that had gripped everything above the Hudson Highlands , and seemed to be on the way to the city itself . She nodded . " The far north ? " " Yes , " she said . " How ? " " Not easily , " Virginia answered , and looked down , embarrassed . " Let 's get some food into you and the child , " Praeger said . " The maitre d ' has a very gentle fish porridge for babies : I 've seen him prepare it , and I 'd eat it myself . And , as for you , may I recommend that you have what we 're having ? " " I do n't know . I do n't have much money . " " No no , " Praeger assured her with remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monthly management dinner . Everyone eats on The Sun . We 're having some oyster pan roast , grilled haddock filets stuffed with lobster , roasted potatoes , green peas , and Dutch beer . It 's coming all around , and in half a second I can order another place . " " Thank you , " said Virginia , delighted at her excellent fortune . " Do n't mention it , " said Praeger . " May we introduce our-selves ? "  |p229That  was a rhetorical question . They were itching to introduce themselves , especially the single men , except for Courtenay Favat , who stuck his head in the air , like a turtle . Jessica said , " I 'd like you to meet my friend Virginia Gamely . " " From Lake of the Coheeries , New York , " Virginia added in a voice like a bell , after which the managing editor called the roll of his subordinates according to the order in which they ringed the table . There was Courtenay Favat , editor of the home and ladies ' page , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrons looked to it for canning and pickling hints , or advice on how to darn and crochet . Courtenay was simultaneously food , wine , fashion , and home editor , and he had half a page or less per day in which to operate . The Sun was devoted to hard news , literature , science , exploration , and art . Its competitor , The New York Ghost ( a tabloid founded by the Australiannewspaper magnate , Rupert Binkey , and left to his grandson , Craig ) had literally thousands of employees doing Courtenay 's job . They even had an editor-in-chief of vegetables , and a dry-cleaning critic . But because Harry Penn was a puritan , a spartan , a stoic , and a trojan , he brooked no full-page banner headlines about truffles or potato puffs . Hugh Close , The Sun 's rewrite editor , had the boundless energy of a hound , and was always perched upright , like a Labrador waiting for a stick to be thrown into a cool lake . He had a red mustache , and red hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see puns in everything , and one could not speak to him without suffering an embarrassing disinternment of double entendres . His suits were gray ; his shirts had collars with bars ; he could read a thousand words a minute upside down and backward ( the words , that is , not him ) ; he knew all the Romance languages ( including Romanian ) , Hindi , Chuvash , Japanese , Arabic , Gullah , Turqwatle , and Dutch ; he could speak any of these languages in the accent of the other ; he generated new words at a mile a minute ; was the world 's foremost grammarian and a master of syntax ; and he drove everyone mad . But The Sun was unmatched in style and linguistic precision . Words were all he knew ; they possessed and overwhelmed him , as if they were a thousand white cats with whom he shared a one-room apartment . ( In fact , hep230did not like cats , because they could not talk and would not listen . ) Then there was William Bedford , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even when he hiccuped , it was said , a stock price jumped out , and he had asked in his will to be mummified in ticker tape . He looked like a British major who had just emerged from the desert , which is to say that he had a long thin face , hair of bronze , gold , and silver , and an expression that was lean , and grave , and slightly alcoholic . Both his father and grandfather had been presidentsof the New York Stock Exchange , so he knew everyone and everyone knew him . His column was religion to many , and the organization of The Sun 's financial section was a pleasant miracle of graphs , charts , illustrations , and accurate analysis . Harry Penn always said that he wanted people who were good at what they did , even if they had ragged edges ( though Bedford was an obvious smoothie compared to the various saws that headed other departments ) . " We 're not a college , " Harry Penn once declared . " We 're a newspaper . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts , fanatics , geniuses . I do n't care if they 're a little peculiar . Close , here , who is sort of peculiar himself , will polish out all the unbecomingoddities , and that will give us a paper which is to the newspaper trade what the Bible is to religion . Understand ? " To round it out was , appropriately , Marko Chestnut , chief artistfor both The Sun and The Whale . All the time that they had been talking , he had been sketching , and he introduced himself by holdingup the drawing he had done . No stranger to the powers of art , Virginia immediately knew several things about Marko Chestnut . First , as with the other senior staff of The Sun , he was , in terms of his skill , second to none . Over many years of rapid sketching , the demand upon a newspaper artist for speed and memorization had taught him to extract the real and essential lines of the scene before him . And Virginia was pleased that he was not content , as so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humorous sketch of the diners . Although she did not know it , restaurants all over the city were filled with partial caricatures that betrayed not the subjects ' distortions , but the artist 's lack of vision . One could , in a few lines , show the soul . One could , if one had the courage . For the world was full of feelings , and there was so much to people that even weak lines ofp231charcoal could enlighten and amaze  --  not because of what they were , but because of what they showed of the truth . In Marko Chestnut 's drawing , virtues and idiosyncrasies became magically evident . Praeger de Pinto was drawn larger than the rest , and , like all people of destiny , had a look of both contentment and agitation . Bedford had shining eyes , a gray suit as pale as ash , and a smile like that of a kind wolf . Next to him perched Close , caught disarmingly in a moment of laughter . Courtenay Favat was pictured as a very small face subsumed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , standing , was an unmistakable fusion of womanly beauty and ripening sex . In the drawing of her there was no color , but , rather , a suggestion of ivory where thighs and bosom pressured a rounded outpouring of silk . Marko Chestnut had emphasized Virginia'sspringy black hair , her country-straight back , and her delightful smile . Martin was given a lifted eyebrow . His skepticism was directedat Marko Chestnut himself , who was bent over , faceless , renderingthe drawing in which he appeared . When the introductions were completed , a band struck itself up in a corner under one of the many echoing arches and began to play palm waltzes . Praeger summoned a waitress to ask for two and a half more dinners , for Virginia and Martin , and for his secretary  --  red-haired , green-eyed Lucia Terrapin , who had come in with some things for him to sign . The halibut steaks sizzled , the peas glistened like medieval enamels , the potatoes sang to one another of the pleasures of their roast , and the beer was as good as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake of the Coheeries tavern . They ate like jackals , and though they tried to discuss business , they were having too much fun . The conversation drifted while , eating ferociously and tapping their toes to the tune of Dewey 's " Olives Omnikia , " they attempted to find out about the long-legged northern beauty , and her baby who sang along with the music in a most unusual , unrestrained , and mysteriouscacophony . " Is your husband coming down soon ? " asked Lucia Terrapin , who was young , and bound to make faux pas . " I do n't have a husband , " Virginia answered without the slightesthint of discomfort , " at least not for the present . His father , " shep232continued , turning briefly to Martin , " was overtaken with a religious fervor so extreme that he had to leave us . That 's all right . We 've accommodated . " Trying to smooth the ripples , Lucia said , " Is he still up there , in Lake of the Fairies ? " " Fairies ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it called that before . It 's Lake of the Coheeries , not Fairies . " Hugh Close was suddenly excited by the possibility of learningthe derivation of a word . " What does it mean ? " he asked . " It does n't mean anything , " answered Virginia . " It 's a propername . " " Yes , but where does it come from ? Which is to say . . . " " It 's etymologically uncertain , " Virginia declared . " But I have my own theory . You know of course that a beer ' is a measure of linen or woolen yarn containing two cuts , the sixth part of a hesp or hank of yarn , or the twenty-fourth part of a spyndle . Though the origin of the word is obscure , most philologists agree that it 's close to the Old Norse herfe , ' meaning skein , " she said , sparkling . " But do n't be fooled by Old Norse cognates ! " " Certainly not . I should say , " said Favat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fooling around with aural analogies of English and the Teutonics , especially Old High German , you 're bound to make mistakes . The secret for determiningthe origins of upper New York State place-names lies , I believe , in morphological and orthographical distortions produced by naive transliterations or imprecise recollections ( or , of course , translingual or cross-dialectical phonological adaptation ) of placenamesin an unfamiliar language . What I think is that Coheeries is the American dialectical form of Grohius , who was one of the first Dutch patroons to settle west of the mountains . In encompassing most of the eastern shore of the lake , his estate may have been thought to include the lake itself . Thus , the Lake of Grohius , transforming slowly over time into the Lake of the Coheeries , just as Krom Moerasje , ' meaning crooked little swamp , ' in Dutch , became Gramercy ' in English ; thus your Gramercy Park . But I really do n't know . " She laughed . Everyone who heard this , especially Close , was as stunned as ap233bird dog at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little dissertationwas not the normal stuff of social discourse , for , after all , she had spent her life with Mrs. Gamely , who could spit out thirty paragraphslike that as easily as she could turn a flapjack . " Do you have a doctorate in linguistics ? " asked Praeger . " Me ? " Virginia was surprised and embarrassed . " Oh no , Mr. de Pinto . I never went to school for a day in my life . There is no school in Lake of the Coheeries . " " There is n't ? " " No . " " I thought , " said Marko Chestnut , " that every child in New York State had to go to school . " " Perhaps , " Virginia explained . " But , you see , Lake of the Coheeriesis n't really in New York State . " " It is n't ? " several people asked at once . " No , " she said , anticipating difficulty . " It 's not on the map , and mail never gets through unless one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain . You ca n't , well , you ca n't just go there . " " You ca n't ? " " No . " Now she knew she was on thin ice . " You have to be . You have to be . . . " " What ? " " You have to be . . . " " A resident , " said Jessica . " Yes ! " Virginia exclaimed , " a resident . " Then , because Jessica brought all her influence to bear , the matterwas quietly dropped . No one believed in the cloud wall anymore ; no one could see it ; no one understood . It was best not to pursue the subject . Anyway , recognizing Virginia 's unusual perspective and apparentintelligence ( not to mention her beauty ) , each department bead proceeded to sound her out with an eye to offering her a job . Economic as usual , Bedford asked her , quite simply , what she did . " In what circumstance ? " she responded , puzzled , for in Lake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question . " For a living , " he said , unwilling to be put off . " Oh , all kinds of things . I help mother cultivate the grapes and ( urn , and tend the vegetables and the apiary . I cut ice from the lakep234in winter . I fish . I gather berries , weave , mend , cook , bake , sew , and take care of Martin . Sometimes , I do the calculations for the village accounts , or read to Daythril Moobcot when he has to go down underneath the dynamo to fix it . I work a lot in the library . The town has very few people , but in our library we have more than a million and a half volumes . " " That 's it , " Praeger said under his breath , wondering if she could write , and what she might say . " And I tutor children and adults when they are in need , for which the village pays me a small cash sum . " Even Favat was interested in her now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muffins and other rural foods ( which , in fact , she did ) . " Can you draw ? " asked Marko Chestnut , already in love . " No , " answered Virginia , modestly looking down . She was uncomfortablenow with all this attention : she had not really been aware of it at first . Jessica rescued her . They had had a difficult trip , Jessica said , and it was time for the baby to sleep . Before they went to bed in the new Penn house ( somewhere , it seemed to Virginia , inside a vast maze of overly prosperous streets ) , Jessica spoke to Virginia on the landing . " Praeger told me that he would like to see you , tomorrow if possible , at The Sun . He thinks , " she continued , with the air of an official about to award a lottery prize , " that he may want to offer you a job on The Sun or The Whale , or both , as is often the case . " " But I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I have a feeling that you could learn . Do n't you think it might be a fine idea ? " " Yes , " answered Virginia . " If I 'm lucky , I 'll dream about it tonight , and tomorrow I 'll know what to do . " oN the afternoon that Virginia went down to Printing House Square to see Praeger de Pinto in the old and beautiful offices of The Sun , the city was ablaze in winter blue . To get there she had to pass through the Lower East Side and Chinatown , and these places full ofp235surging color , that were the match of any Oriental city , pleased her no end . By the time she reached Praeger 's office , strength had come to her from a thousand dissonant sources . She had harvested it from the city , the harbor , the ten thousand ships moving down a net of fast rivers , and the pristine geometry of the colossal bridges . Praeger asked her questions for two hours , drinking in her soft eloquence and marveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you write the way you speak ? " he asked . " I suppose so , " she said . " But I 'm not sure . " Then he sent her into another room to write her first impressionsof New York . She returned in an hour with a perfect essay as fresh as an apple . He read it twice , and then again . It was as pleasurablefor him as kissing a beautiful woman . " I feel , " he said , " as if I 've seen this city for the first time ; and I thank you for it . " Virginia had written only what had seemed to her to be the truth of the way things were . " Will you write a column for the editorial page ? We 'll run it in both papers , twice or three times a week . The system here is unique : it was fashioned after that of a whaling ship . Everyone is paid in shares , and  --  except for the size of offices and number of assistants  --  the benefits are equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well compensated because you would have a large numberof shares . " Then Praeger told her the range of the money , and even the low figure was more than she thought might have come to her in a lifetime , much less a year . The high figure was greater than the gross domestic products of Lake of the Coheeries and Bunting 's Reef ( the next town ) put together . It scared her , but then she remembered that in traveling through the city for an hour , she had seen enough to write a thousand encyclopedias of deep praise . Surely , she thought , two or three pieces a week would be no problem consideringthe fact that a day 's walk among the towers , bridges , and squares would send her home with her pen cocked as if it were ready to he launched from a crossbow . " I think I 'll take it , " she said . " But I do n't know the city , and I do n't know this kind of work . I fear that if I start too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , besides , Mother always said that onep236must be devoted to the thing itself , so I do n't care for quick promotionsand too much ease . Let me start from the beginning , with everyone else . I like the race rather than the winning . " " Do you ? Really ? " " Yes . I 've imagined great victories , and I 've imagined great races . The races are better . " " The pay is n't the same at the bottom . " " We 're not materialists . We do n't need much . " " The custom here is to give a new employee ten days at salary , during which he can think about what 's going on , and make an honorable and efficient break with whatever he has been doing . I expect you to rise rapidly . I hope that before the year is up , you 'll be writing a column for us . " Virginia walked through the spacious galleries of The Sun , past people whose work seemed to mesmerize them , and she skipped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She took half of her ten days ' salary and put it in an envelope that she bought from a man who sold stationery from the inside of his coat . This she would send to her mother . She had n't that much left , and she knew that it would be difficult . Still , she took the crowded streets and passed like a newly crowned queen through one after another of the city 's exhausting districts . When she got to the Penns ' , she picked up little Martin and danced about . This was only a dream . But the next day , upon her awakening , the elements of the dream fell into place exactly . Even the words spoken were the same . She had seen in her sleep the details of rooms in which she had never been , and known weather that had not yet formed , and streets upon which she had never walked . One thing was noticeably different . In Chinatown , on the way home , she bought Martin a big cherry cookie . It was sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a Chinese hat . He seemed very strange . Now there were practical things to be accomplished . She had to find an apartment , get some new clothes , arrange for someone to take care of Martin while she worked . But these things would be easy . She believed that the city was so full of combinations , permutations , and possibilities that it permitted not only any desire to be fulfilled ,  |p237but  any course to be taken , any reward to be sought , any life to be lived , and any race to be run . She closed her eyes and saw the city burning before her in enticing gold . The sky , filled with great voluminousclouds , was ablaze in winter blue.  |p238THOUGH  San Francisco is a tranquil city , anesthetized in blue , when Vittorio Marratta died it was if a clap of thunder had rolled over the hills . Had he not specifically prohibited it , the line of black limousines following his hearse would have been a mile long . He was central to several communities at once , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even his enemies to pour out their respect . Signor Marratta was the leader of San Francisco'sItalian community ; a scientist whose discoveries in astrophysicswere weighty enough to occasion the naming of not one but three galaxies after him ( Marratta I , II , III ) in a far-distant section of the northern sky ; the onetime president of the university across the bay , in the days before its troubles shattered the scholarly quiet in which it had been founded ; a former captain in the Navy , commander of ap239capital ship in wartime ; and a wealthy fleet owner whose fast containercarriers graced the bay with arrivals and departures several times a day from or for Tokyo , Accra , London , Sydney , Riga , Bombay , Capetown , and Athens , and whose tugboats made all the adjustmentsrequired for the very same harbor that his ships made busy . The obituary writers drew their incomplete sketches , touring through his life like travelers to England who do not ever see swans , sheep , bicycles , and blue eyes . They knew that he had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had deserted the carnage , spent a year like a thief , and finally swum into the harbor at Genoa to climb up the anchor chains of a ship , which  --  unbeknownst to him  --  was headed for San Francisco . They knew that he had married the daughter of a ship owner , but they did not know how much he had loved her before she died , or what it had done to him when she had . They knew that he had fought for the presidency of the university , but not how hard and taxing a fight it had been . They knew that he had discovered galaxies and described some fundamental truths , but they did n't know by what hand he had been guided , nor that , after many years of deep thought about what he had seen and measured , he had been rewarded by the sight of something that he was unable to reveal only because of the character of the age . And they knew that he had two sons , but they knew little about them . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds of things happened . Relatives bustled about buying flowers and renting automobiles , only to find that they had been excluded from the procession by order of the deceased  --  who had wanted just his sons at his graveside , and a priest . Lawyers and accountants were put to work as hard and suddenly as Seabees who must build an airfield in half an hour . Academic buildings were renamed . The observatoryflew its flag at half-staff . And everyone wondered how the sons would manage all that would be left to them . Seventy-five large ships , all the tugboats in San Francisco Bay , a department store , several office towers , enough prime real estate upon which to build another city , trusts , subdivisions , and the ownership of large blocks of stock in great corporations , were all at issue in the will . Signor Marratta had come to own a section of the economy as varied and richly colored as a long core sample from the bed of a tropical sea ,  |p240and  his herd of chattels was like the one on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disposition of these assets . The will was read on a Wednesday in May , three weeks after the funeral , when the cracks of thunder had begun to fade . In May serenity , students left on sunny empty roads to see other parts of the country , and those who remained were enjoying the strong sun , and the shining clear days that were still wonderfully cool . A hundred people were gathered in the nearly ultraviolet shadows of the largest room in the Marratta house on Presidio Heights . Swaths of deep blue were visible through French doors that led to a long balcony overlooking the bay . Had it not been for the chill of the marble , as white and clean as the cliffs of Yosemite , Signor Marratta himself might have been forgotten , for , with 150 people in attendance , the reading of the will was like a cross between a private school commencement , a court-martial , and the assembly of a covert religious sect . Sitting in the first row were the two sons , Evan and Hardesty . In their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong and restless in a way that suggested that they should have been not in a ballroom but out on a playing field somewhere , or in a forest where the light was dazzling on blue streams . " I fear , " said the senior of the five lawyers who directed the proceedings , " that today there will be much disappointment in this room . Signor Marratta was a complicated man , and as is often the case with complicated men , he favored simple actions . " During nearly half a century of association with him as friend and legal adviser , I found myself in a lifelong debate about the law . Signor Marratta did not know the law , but he knew its spirit , and as often as not he insisted upon a simple approach that I rejected  --  only to hear from me ( after much labor and research ) that , indeed , he was right . I do n't know how he did it , but somehow he knew what the law intended and in what places it would stand fast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply on his behalf for posthumous honoraryadmission to the bar , but , rather , to caution you against making a quick judgment about what will undoubtedly appear to some as a rash act . " Signor Marratta was the richest man I have ever known , and he left the shortest will that I have ever seen . If you expect to sit herep241for hours , listening to ever larger disbursements , you will be surprised , for he has provided most of everything to only one inheritor , and a small gift to another . I am afraid that many of you will be deservedly embittered . " Instead of stirring , the room was tense with silence . Expectation and fear coiled together in a stalemate as symmetrical and interdependentas the struggling snakes of a caduceus . Representatives of universities and charitable institutions , directors of hospitals , longforgottenrelatives , stray acquaintances , obscure employees , and delegatesof the press strained together in suspense  --  all but the very last hoping beyond hope that the rash act of which the lawyer had spoken would make them wealthy beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Evan would receive the small gift , which would probably be something bitter and ironic in token of his less than exemplary character . His mother 's sudden death had made him a master of calculated greed , dissolute behavior , and indiscriminatecruelty , and he lived only for what he could extract from his father , who loved him despite this . He had bloodied Hardesty so often in vicious boyhood attacks that Hardesty was always afraid of him , even in Hardesty 's late twentiesafter he had fought in two wars and long been a strapping athlete . The years of military service , interrupting his career at graduate school , had made the younger brother diffident and shy . He had been broken more than once in the army , and was one of those who had come back hurt and disillusioned . The witnesses at the reading of the will assumed that everything would go to Hardesty because he was so quiet and nondescript , and they eagerly awaited the final slap that Evan would receive for all the drugs he had taken , cars he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days he had wasted . They saw that even in the short space between the lawyer 's announcement of the peculiar conditions of the will and the undoing of the waxen seal that had protected it , Evan was staring at Hardesty in a way that suggested intimidation , flattery , and murder . Evan was sweating and breathing hard . His fists were tight and his eyes wide . Hardesty , on the other hand , sat sadly next to hisp242brother , thinking , undoubtedly , of their father  --  not because he was pious or dull , but because his father had been his only friend , and now he was horribly lonely . He wanted the proceedings to end ; he wanted to return to his rooms , where he had very little except books , plants , and the view . Evan had moved out years before to an aerie on Russian Hill , a cavernous triplex that he used for seducing women who were impressed by the vast amount of electronic equipment he had amassed against several of its walls so that it looked like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . He slept on a blue-and-gold Persian rug , wrapped in an old Abercrombie &; Fitch rust-colored wool blanket . His pillow , however , was eiderdown , and he always kept a clean case on it . Apart from thousands of books , Hardesty had few material possessions . He did n't have a car , preferring to walk or take public transportation wherever he had to go . He did n't have a watch . He had one suit , and it was fifteen years old . And he had one pair of hiking shoes , and they had seen three years of daily use . In contrast to his brother 's closet of eighty shaped suits , half a hundred pairs of Italian shoes , and a thousand ties , hats , canes , and coats , Hardesty 's wardrobe could fit into a small knapsack . Considering his wealth , he lived rather simply . His father had known very well that Hardesty was silent and withdrawn because he was recovering from the wars , gathering strength , learning . Signor Marratta had loved Evan the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  all in sorrow . But he had loved Hardesty out of the deepest respect and sympathy  --  all in hope and pride . It was generally believed that Hardesty would be rewarded for his asceticism and discipline , and that he would emerge as a solid and engaging figure fit to control his father 's wealth and manage it justly . There was much pleasant anticipation of seeing him move from his quiet world into the rush of things , where , it was presumed , his fresh and obviously keen intellect would be not only constructive , but surprising . Of all those present at the reading of the will , only Hardesty did not assume that he was due for an apotheosis in dollars , and only Hardesty sat calmly and free of expectation . The lawyer read.  | " Herein the last will and testament of Vittorio Marratta , San Francisco , drawn the first of September , the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-five . " All my worldly possessions , ownerships , receivables , shares , interests , rights , and royalties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is on the long table in my study , will go to the other . Hardesty will decide , and his decision as it is first announced will be irrevocable . Neither son will be entitled to the patrimony of the other , ever , under any circumstances , the death or desires of one or the other notwithstanding . I make this declaration in sound mind and body , convinced of its justice and ultimate value . ' " At last , Hardesty was amused . Though he had a sense of humor , it was largely a private attribute . For the first time since his father 's death , he smiled , and in doing so he revealed even further that he had a kind , intelligent , interesting face  --  unlike that of his grimacingbrother . Hardesty shook his head in pleasant incredulity and then began to laugh when he saw Evan begin to quiver in anticipation of having to get a job . No way existed for Evan to appeal the decision , and neither could he think of any means by which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always hated it , even though it was made of gold , because it was engraved with words that he did not understand , and his father had spoken about it in terms far too reverential for a tray worth no more than several thousand dollars . So what if it had been brought from Italy . It was just junk , and he saw it as a pact between his father and Hardesty , a magical link between them that excluded him . The terrible irony was that he would be left with the salver ( which he had often ridiculed and once even thrown out the window ) and Hardesty would inherit enough to make a thousand men rich . Evan was convinced that he had n't a chance , not because Hardesty was interested in the wealth ( for he clearly was not ) but because Hardesty 's integrity would force him to take responsibility for managing the assets that everyone well knew Evan would mismanage . So the older brother closed his eyes and prepared to face what was for him the equivalent of a firing squad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marratta assets ( exaggerating what need n't have been exaggerated ) , saying the numbers to himself likep244a monk in a trance . Perhaps his father 's soul , in ascension , had eavesdroppedon his first son 's spirit as it was told of the father 's passing , and had been offended by the elated singing . All Evan knew was that Hardesty had the satisfied look of power . The assembled political and communal leaders set their eyes upon Hardesty to confirm that what was obviously in his self-interest was also in the general interest , and to urge him to do the expected . Surely , they seemed to be saying , if you renounce the inheritance and it goes to Evan , you will have committed a great evil . Several of them , knowing their own children , grew quite nervous . " I recommend , " the lawyer said , " that we adjourn these proceedingsuntil we are notified that Mr. Marratta has reached a firm decision . " He wanted Hardesty 's ear , so as to persuade him to do the right thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , " said Hardesty . " I 've decided . " The tension this engendered was , if not unbearable , at least unpleasant . On the one hand , if he had wanted time to think , it would have meant that he was not sure , and to be unsure of such an obvious choice was a dangerous sign of instability . On the other hand , a firm and quick decision could go either way , and even the right decision would have been taken too quickly . One way or another , it was frightening . If only they could get to him before he opened his mouth , to make sure that he considered these options in context . " Such a momentous choice , " began the lawyer . " No , " Hardesty said firmly . " You do n't understand . My father had a way of speaking , a way of doing things indirectly so that we could learn while he slowed decisions and held them open to view . When we were young , if we asked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'd show us his watch . Everything he did enabled others to learn . He was desirous that we ' by indirections find directions out . ' And , in this instance , his wishes are very clear to me . Perhaps if I did n't know him so well  --  excuse me , if I had n't known him so well  --  I would have a choice . But I have no choice here , not if I am to fulfill his ambitions for me , and , like him , rise out of myself and become something better than what I am.  | " No . I gladly and lovingly submit to his will , and I am sure of what he wanted . The salver is mine . " A bigger stir could not have been created in San Francisco if the San Andreas fault had finally unseamed itself . Evan could hardly stand the shock . Possession of so much wealth took away his voice for an hour and a half : the sudden infusion of cash alone was like half a pound of cocaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except for the brief moment it took to condemn him . Then , penniless and powerless , he was ignored in favor of his brother , to whom , by necessity , all eyes began to turn . The lawyer had wanted to know why Hardesty had done what he had done . But Hardesty refused to tell . The salver had been given to Signor Marratta by his father , Hardesty said , who had received it from his father , who had received it from his father . . . etc. , etc. , how far back no one knew . But that was not the reason . He thought it best to separate himself from the cacophony and gossip that he caused in San Francisco . He was no longer entitled to his room with its wood-railed balcony high above the bay ( and would miss it forever ) , he was unsure of what he would do for a living , and possession of the salver was demanding in itself . He knew that , to satisfy what he understood to be its requirements , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to convert and desecrate their father 's study , Hardesty would have to go there and find his way past shields and blockades of memory to claim the great and demanding gift . Then he would leave forever the city of his birth , his home , and the place where his father and mother were buried . THE study was the highest room in the house , surmounted by a small old-fashioned observatory in which Signor Marratta had spent many hours in the early days before photon-count narrow-field telescopy . Because they were on the most elevated piece of ground in Presidio Heights , the study on the top floor had a commanding view . As Hardesty climbed the stairs , he remembered what his father had taught him about views.  | " See it , and it is yours , " he had said in Italian to the little boy , carrying him from one window to the next , and guiding his eye over the hills , bay , and ocean . " Look there , " the father had said , pointing at distant hills the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pelt of the spotted beast . Look how they roll . Look at the muscle under their lively backs . " Outside , the fog and clouds were invading armies which swept in ragged determined lines and flying wings of devoted cavalry to surround the city and outflank the bay . They rushed past and almost buried everything with their pointed and trembling peaks , but still there was a crown of blue above the mountains , so that the light in the study was pure and deep . Light that was predominantly ultraviolet , purple , and blue washed over Hardesty 's face , and over the salver , which glistened like something unearthly . As if he were moving under water , he slowly approached the massive table where the salver had been left by his father as casually as if it had been a dish from the kitchen . The Marrattas believed that the salver was protected . It had survived wars , fires , earthquakes , and thieves , who , like Evan , seemed not to want it . Hardesty wondered how his brother could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun it shone in a hundred thousand colors , all subsumed in gold and silver . Seamless rays arose from it in a solid thicket , radiating in blinding beauty from the words engraved around the rim , meeting the others above the center , and plunging downwardto illuminate the primary inscription . The light on Hardesty 's face went from violet and blue to gold and silver . He felt its warmth , and saw again the inscriptions  --  four virtues , and one seductive and promising sentence suspended in their midst as if it were the hub of a wheel . Many times , his father had taken him to read them , insisting that they were the most important things he could have , and implying with a sharp dismissive gesture of hand and arm that wealth , fame , and worldly possessions were worthless and demeaning . " Little men , " he once said , " spend their days in pursuit of such things . I know from experience that at the moment of their deaths they see their lives shattered before them like glass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they have been pushed , and the expressions on their faces are those of the most unbelievingp247surprise . Not so , the man who knows the virtues and lives by them . The world goes this way and that . Ideas are in fashion or not , and those who should prevail are often defeated . But it does n't matter . The virtues remain uncorrupted and uncorruptible . They are rewards in themselves , the bulwarks with which we can protect our vision of beauty , and the strengths by which we may stand , unperturbed , in the storm that comes when seeking God . " When Hardesty 's mother had died , when he had gone to war , when he had come back , and at all other times of grief , danger , or triumph , his father had made sure that he had gone to the salver . He could almost see his father in front of him , turning the golden tray in his hands . Signor Marratta first read the silvered inscriptions in Italian , and then translated . A foreign language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that marriages between those who speak different tongues allow a gentleness and tolerance untouched by destructive wit . For example , a Japanese kitchen maid might easilymix with the stiffest of the English beau monde , for they would not be able to use her language as a handle with which to throw her out . The same with the virtues when recited in Italian . They were in no way overbearing , or the stock-in-trade of schoolmasters and ministers , so Hardesty accepted them the way he might never have acceptedthem in his own language . " La onesta , honesty , " was the first , never properly valued , SignorMarratta had said , until one must Jose a great deal for its sake alone , " and then , it rises like the sun . " Hardesty 's favorite , even though it was the word about which his mother 's death seemed to revolve , and even though he associated it with tears more than with anything else , was " il coraggio , courage . " Next was one that he hardly understood  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it not a defuncttrait of the martyrs ? Perhaps because it was so rare , it was as mystifying to him as the last virtue ( which almost bumped into " la onesta , " at the bottom of the plate ) , the most puzzling , the one least attractive to him as a young man , " la pazienza , patience . " But none of these qualities , hard to understand as they might have been , and even harder to put into practice , was half as mysteriousas the pronouncement inlaid in white gold on the center of the plate . It was from the Senilia of Benintendi , and Signor Marrattap248made sure early on that Hardesty knew it and would not forget . Now , after his father 's death , alone in a study that was at times high above the clouds , Hardesty picked up the gleaming salver and translatedits inscription out loud : " For what can be imagined more beautiful than the sight of a perfectly just city rejoicing in justice alone . ' " He repeated this to himself several times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held everything he would take with him . A quick look at San Francisco from the tranquillity of the high and isolated study was all he needed to show him that this city  --  as stunningas it was  --  was not and would never be the seat of perfect justice , having no relation to it . It was a paradigm of soulless beauty  --  always cool , forever silent , asleep in blue  --  but it had nothing to do with justice , for justice was not so easy . Justice came from a fight amid complexities , and required all the virtues in the world merely to be perceived . As he walked out of his house for the last time , he realized that any guile and sophistication that he had learned was now gone from him forever . What if he were asked where he was going ? What could he say ? " I 'm looking for the perfectly just city ? " They would think he was a lunatic . " Where are you going , Hardesty ? " Evan asked when Hardesty emerged from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm looking for the perfectly just city . " " Yes , but where are you going ? " Evan wanted Hardesty to guide him in his new responsibilities , and had decided to offer him a very large salary if the lawyers interpreted the will as allowing him to do so . " You would n't understand . You always hated the plate . I alwaysloved it . " " For Christ 's sake , what was it , anyway , some sort of a treasure hunt ? " " In a way . " Evan began to get interested . He knew Hardesty was smart , and now he suspected that the plate was the key to El Dorado . " Have you got it ? " " Right here . " " Let me see it . "  | " There it is , " Hardesty said , taking it out of his pack . He knew exactly what Evan was thinking . " What does it say ? Can you translate ? " " It says , Wash me , I 'm dirty . ' " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told you what it says , Evan . " " What are you going to do ? " Evan asked , in desperation at being left . " I may be going to Italy , but I 'm not sure . " " What do you mean , you 're not sure ? How will you get there ? " " I think I 'll walk , " Hardesty said , laughing . " Walk ? You 're going to walk to Italy ? Is that what the tray says ? " " Yes . " " How ? There 's water , there 's a lot of water . . . . " " Goodbye , Evan . " Hardesty began walking . " I do n't understand you , Hardesty , " Evan screamed . " I never did . What does the tray say ? " " It says , For what can be imagined more beautiful than the sight of a perfectly just city rejoicing in justice alone , ' " Hardesty shouted back . But Evan had already gone in to claim the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ K E R in medieval-looking gray coveralls stiff and dirty with orange paint did not understand why Hardesty , his passenger , trembled with emotion as they drove across the Bay Bridge from San Francisco to Oakland . But it was clear to Hardesty , as they tunneled through a cool bank of mist and watched ships etching white tracks across the deep water below them , that he was going from one world to another . So great was the difference between San Francisco and its foghornson islands in cold waters , and dusty Oakland , that they should have been separated not by seven miles and a bridge , but by seven thousand miles of sea . The shock of traveling between San Francisco and its numbing ultraviolets and Oakland and its dizzying sun enabledHardesty quickly to revert to his army self . As the tollbooths disappeared behind him , he found that he was prepared to climbp250barbed-wire fences , hop freights , sleep on the ground , and cover fifty miles a day on foot . Leaving his emotions where he had shed them into the bay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no money , a vague idea , and a golden plate . The heat on the Oakland side seemed to have started up within him sleek engines that had been silent since the war . He did n't take long to find a good position behind some reeds on the bank of a railroad line running east . He lay there in the sun , his head on his pack , chewing a sprig of grass , until he heard the sound of traveling thunder . Squinting through the vegetation , he saw a lone engine coming down the track . Where the diesel exhaust rose above its black-and-yellow striped cabin ( it looked like a huge motorized bee ) , the air wiggled like a bunch of springs , and six men in denim hung out from both sides in the fashion of circus acrobats on a horse . Everything went by with a roar , and Hardesty put his head back on the knapsack , content to wait . After falling in and out of sleep , he heard the unmistakable rumble of a multi-engined freight . Without even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to look , for when the eight engines came along the rails , pulling two hundred cars , the earth shook and the reeds sang . Oil-covered water in a nearby ditch began to ripple and quiver . The first engine was as black as a gun , and had a yellow light glaring from the top as if it were the truth itself . Having just started out of the Oakland yards , it was beginning to pick up speed , straining to get going , and Hardesty could hear the sharp concussions of the couplers as they snapped into place to pull the hundreds of cars all the way down the line . Quite possibly there 's nothing as fine as a big freight train starting across country in early summer , Hardesty thought . That 's when you learn that the tragedy of plants is that they have roots . The reeds and grasses on the hot mounds and in the ditches turned green with envy and begged to go along ( which is why they waved when the train went by ) . The train itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noise of wind in the trees , easy summer in deep valleys , brown rivers , sparklingbays , and so much prairie that alongside it infinity would look like a tick . When Hardesty saw that a clean new gondola car was coming ,  |p251he  slung his pack and began to run alongside the train . The occasionalstones that had rolled from the railbed onto the black loam path paralleling it dug into his feet through his shoes . Every now and then he would glance to his right to see if the gondola car was approaching . The second ladder moved into place . He put his right hand on it and felt it pulling him along . By the time his left hand had grasped hold , his legs were windmilling at a prodigious rate . Then he moved his right hand up a rung , jumped , and he was riding ahead , free . All in all , it was many times better a sensation than finding a hundred-dollar bill . Vaulting the low bulkhead , he fell onto planks of brand-new pine that smelled like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high enough to keep out most of the wind ( but not all of it ) and hide him from view . He might not be able to see railroad detectivesstanding by the side of the track , but then again , they would not be able to see him . And he would be able to see the fields , the valleys , and the mountain ranges . He could stand up without fear of being decapitated by bridges and tunnels , pace back and forth , run around in circles , whoop , dance , and leave his pack in a corner knowingthat , no matter how much the train lurched , the pack would not roll off into a field , never to be seen again . He was n't hungry , it was lovely weather , and he had the whole country before him . Not surprisingly , he began to sing , and because no one in the world could hear him , and he sang without inhibition , he sang well . The next morning , somewhere in the mountains near Truckee , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight pines , Hardesty paced the length of the gondola car , still happy , though , after a night on the boards , no longer elated . As the train labored up the grade , he realized how difficult his future was going to be . He had often jumped freights to go into the Sierra in rainless summers , but he had always had a home to which he could return . With that no longer true , he was beginning to get some idea of what it had been like for his father to desert a unit of Italian mountain troops that had been cutting itself down to nothing in the Dolomites , and make his way ( as a fugitive ) to the sea and finally to America.  | " For the first months , " Signor Marratta had said , " it was n't so bad . We spent most of the time building fortifications high on cliffs , and we could see the enemy only through our telescopes . But when our redoubts and theirs were finished , generals on both sides were compelled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this seemed ridiculous . We had been quite happy , up there in the mountains , until we began to get killed . I went to our maggiore , and said , ' Why not a stalemate , a balance ? Just because they 're killing each other on the plain does n't mean that we have to do it up here . ' He thought it was a splendid idea , but who was he ? Rome wanted territorial gains . Our half-hearted sharpshooters began to shoot , our artillerymen stuffed the barrels of their fieldpieces and started their bombardments , and those of us unfortunate enough to have been alpinists had to trundle through the defiles and make dangerous ascents  --  so that we might suddenly appear two hundred feet above our unsuspecting adversaries , and shoot down at them . I left half a dozen good friends hanging lifeless on their mountaineering ropes a thousand feet high on sheer walls , because the enemy shot back . They used their cannon , in the most deadly and unpredictable fiat trajectories , to burst apart the cliffs we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted was to live . Had I persisted in that struggle between armed chapters of the Italian and Austrian alpine clubs , you probably would not be here . Besides , you can now join either club and get reciprocal membership in the other . " But Signor Marratta had also had regrets about deserting . Both loyalty and responsibility often did justify the act of dying in place , and it was hard to rid himself of the feeling that he had made " the great refusal . " Hardesty thought that perhaps he himself had shirked his responsibilities when he chose the salver . But , as usual , his father had structured the question so that either choice would have brought him doubt . The doubt , his father might have said in characteristic Marratta fashion , would propel him to seek a far more thorough , adventurous , and valuable resolution than he would seek without it . " All great discoveries , " the elder Marratta had once said , " are productsas much of doubt as of certainty , and the two in opposition clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , Hardesty was thrown with irresistiblep253force to the floor of the gondola car . In the fraction of a second before he lost consciousness , he regretted that the boards seemed to be risingtoward his face ; he wondered what was on his back ; and he feared that the car ahead had tumbled over and was in the midst of crushing him . Then he blacked out . When he awakened , he was lying with his face to the sky . Blood had clotted over his cheeks , he felt sore , and he discovered on the side of his head a gash as long as a caterpillar and at least as distinct . Then he noticed a creature squatting against the wall . Only by blinking , and clearing the blood from his eyes , could he see that it was a man who could not have been more than five feet tall , but who looked about two feet high because of the powerful muscle-bound way in which he was squatting . He was wearing a costume that , at first , Hardesty could not take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as a whole it was breathtaking and unbelievable . His shoes were big dollops of greasy black leather that looked like pomaded cannonballs  --  theseHardesty recognized as the most expensive mountaineeringboots with many years of wear and a bear or two worth of grease . To fall in a river with shoes like that meant certain death . And if they were to catch fire they would burn for a month , even under water . He wore zigzagged edelweiss-design , purple-and-blue knee socks , cobalt blue knickers , rainbow suspenders , a violet shirt , and a pirate-style bandanna that was the same purple and blue as the knee socks but had a hypnotic pattern of red washed through it . His face was almost fully covered by a beard and perfectly round , rosecoloredsunglasses . Two fingers were missing from his right hand , three from the left , he carried a bright blue day pack , and he wore a sling of mountain-climbing equipment that was the necklace of necklaces . It was dripping with silver carabiners , baubled with shiny climbing nuts , clanging with pitons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred fluorescent interwoven colors . Slung over his shoulder was an orange-and-black climbing rope , and he was chewing a piece of beef jerky as big as a notebook . " Sorry about that , " he said between chaws on the beef . " I jumped the train from a bridge and I did n't see you . Thanks . " " Thanks for what ? " asked Hardesty . " Cushioning my fall . "  | " What are you ? " " What am I ? What do you mean by that ? " " What the hell are you ? Am I dreaming you ? You look like Rumpelstiltskin . " " Never heard of him . Does he climb in the Sierra ? " " No , he does n't climb in the Sierra . " " I 'm a climber . A professional . I 'm on my way to the Wind Rivers , where I 'm going to do the first solo of East Temple Spire . If I 'm beartrap enough , I 'll do it at night . Boy , that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuts are safe . " " Yes , " said Hardesty , " I , too , am glad that your rack and nuts are safe . " " That 's a bad gash you 've got . You ought a put some Nandiboon on that . " " What 's Nandiboon ? " " Great stuff , Oil of Nandiboon . It heals anything real fast . A friend of mine brought it back from Nepal . Here .. . . " He reached into the blue pack and brought out a small flask , which he uncorked with his teeth . " I sort of feel responsible for you now . " " Wait a minute , " said Hardesty as the oil was smeared over his wound . " Do n't worry , it 's organic . " " What 's your name ? " " Jesse Honey . " " What ? " " Jesse . . . Honey . Honey is my last name . It 's not my fault . It could have been worse . I could have been a girl , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who the hell knows what . What 's your name ? " " My name is Hardesty Marratta . What 's in this stuff ? It 's beginning to sting . " " It does sting . But it heals real fast . " The pain from the Nandiboon Oil was on the rise , and Hardesty suspected that it would rise quite high . It did . Two or three minutes after it had been applied , the Nandiboon Oil was seething into his skin in thousands of boiling potholes . Whatever Nandiboon Oil was ,  |p255it  was a good imitation of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide . Hardestyrolled in agony . " I 'll get some water , " screamed Jesse Honey . " There 's a stream crossing the switchback . I 'll catch you when you come this way up ahead . " Hardesty did n't even hear him . But ten minutes later he saw Jesse Honey 's hand begging for assistance over the edge of the gondolacar , and he went to help him . Jesse Honey threw a plastic jug of water into the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislocated it . Hardesty collapsed again . Jesse Honey seized his arm ( the wrong one ) and proceeded to relocate it according to the principles of first aid . But , since it was already located , he , in fact , dislocated it . " Are you trying to kill me ? " Hardesty shouted . " Because if you are , I wish you would just get it over with . " Jesse Honey seemed not to hear , and went about relocating both of Hardesty 's arms . " I learned that on Mount McKinley , " he said , with evident satisfaction . Then he washed the Nandiboon Oil off Hardesty 's face , and jumped from the train once again . When he returned , he was carrying a huge pile of brushwood . " What 's that for ? " " Got ta make a fire to boil water to cook the food and have tea , " Jesse Honey said , lighting up the kindling . " How can you make a fire on a wooden.floor ? " Hardesty asked , too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flames were leaping in the wind . Jesse Honey tried to stamp them out , but when his greasy boots began to ignite , he withdrew . For half an hour the wind carried the fire to front and rear . Lubricating oil , paint , the wooden floors and interiors of boxcars , dunnage , and a thousand miscellaneous cargoes all took flame until finally the train- was blazing in sheets of fire . The train crew discoveredit too late to stop , and tried to make for the saddle of the mountains , where there was no wind . By the time they got there it was too hot for Jesse and Hardesty to stay on , so they jumped off andbegan walking east . As the sun set , they could see two red glows ( the brighter being the conflagration on the train ) , and they heardperiodic explosions marking the demise of tank cars laden with corn/bustibles . According to Jesse Honey , it was all part of nature 's way . " Trains , " he said , " were never meant to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night they walked along the length of cool valleys on the crest of the Sierra , where they found only starlight and the deep tranquillity of mountains in early summer . The silence of the trees and quiescence of the wind were nature 's hope and disbelief that winter had passed , a time when the wild terrain holds its breath before rejoicing , for fear of calling back the bright blue northerns and the snow . At first , Hardesty and Jesse did not speak on the chalk-white paths that blackened shafts of alpine defiles , and their eyes tracked the stars as they watched the rim of the mountains swallow them up . The air was springlike . It conveyed the same buoyant pleasure as walking into a gathering of little children , arrayed like wild flowers , in their colorful hats and scarves . As always on the first day at altitude , it was easy to walk all night , and besides , the air was so fresh and the streams so roiling , white , and numb that no living thing which knew joy or freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon came up as creamy as pearl , perfectly round , benevolent , a flawless bright lantern . Jesse claimed that there was an excellent freight line in the direction that he insisted they follow , just a mile or two ahead . They had covered fifteen miles by the time the moon disappeared and the east brightened , and still there was no railroad . " There 's a beautiful bridge right over the track , " said Jesse , " made of logs and cables . I do n't know who built it , and I do n't know what for , but you can drop right onto the train with the greatest of ease . " " I do n't understand , " said Hardesty . " Why do you have to fall from above every time you get on a freight ? Why not just run alongsideand catch a rung ? " Jesse looked at him with hurt and annoyance . " I ca n't , " he stated bitterly . " I ca n't reach high enough . " " Oh , I see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was breathtakingly short . " How tall are you , anyway ? " " What 's the difference ? "  | " No difference . I 'm just curious . " " Four-four and three-quarters . I was supposed to be six-three . That 's what the doctor said , from the spaces in my X-rays . My grandfather was six-six , my father six-eight , and my brothers are taller than that . " " What happened to you ? " Jesse bristled . " I do n't know , " he said , shaking his head . " For a man who stands four feet five inches tall . . . " " I thought you said four-four and three-quarters , " interrupted Hardesty . " Drop dead , " Jesse snapped . " For a man who stands four feet five inches tall , this is a difficult world . When I read in the newspapersthat they describe someone who 's five-eight as being of below average height , how do you think I feel ? Girls wo n't even look at me . Most of them do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . I was n't allowed to join the Army , though the Navy was eager to have me  --  as a chimney sweep . I went to college , I 'm an engineer , and the Navy wanted me to sweep their goddamned chimneys . When big tall jerks strut around because they 're proud of how tall they are , I just want to take a machine gun . . . . It does n't matter . I do n't care anymore . What I need is a beautiful short woman in a little cabin near a low mountain range . " " I think that there are places like that in the Black Forest , " Hardesty said , " where , according to legend , at least , you might find what you 're looking for . " " No trolls , " said Jesse . " I was born American , and that cuts out trolls . " " No , no , no . I 'm talking about pretty little blond blue-eyed women like you see on carved bottle stoppers . " " Not forme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind whose knees come up to my throat . " That day they covered forty miles in the full sun , talking about women , mountain climbing , freight trains , and politics . Jesse was an avid supporter of President Palmer ( perhaps because he was the shortest president since Linscott Gregory ) , whereas Hardesty was willing to vote for him , but no more than that . They were self/there they would walk through vast stands of dwarf pine . Hardesty said he thought that he might have broken a bone when he cushioned Jesse 's landing . " Do n't you know ? " asked Jesse . " No , I do n't . I never broke anything before . " " You never broke anything before ! That 's crazy ! I 've broken nearly every bone in my body . Once , I forgot to anchor my rappel , and I broke sixteen bones at the same time . I was absentminded on the Grand , and belayed myself with a reepschnur . ( That 's like using a shoelace . ) Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think I broke everything except my word , because , after the reepschnur snapped at forty feet , I kept falling for another three hundred and fifty . " " I 'm surprised you did n't die . " " I hit a lot of ledges . " They came to a crystal-blue lake almost as long and narrow as a river . From atop a group of boulders on the south side , they could see the railroad line about a mile across the water . Jesse said that they would have to swim , but that because the lake was geothermal it was as warm as bathwater . Hardesty put his finger in , and disagreed . " Not on the edges ! " Jesse exclaimed . " Any fool would know that geothermally warmed lakes are hot only in the deeper portions . That 's where all the heat exchange takes place . Several tons of refrigerated thermal currents activate an ion-intensive , BTU-rich wave transfer beginning at the upwelling parameters of the tollopsoid region of the deepest central subset . Thus , the agitated interference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimensionalflows of surface water trapped in an oscillating torroidal belt that varies only with alkaloid surfactant inversions of normal stability caused by drought-induced desiccant concentrations due to insufficient intra-aqueous leaching . " " Still , " said Hardesty , " we might do better to walk around . " " Not a chance . The railroad is not even tangential to the lake . It veers down from the northwest and veers up again to the northeast , because they built it that way in the days when they needed to top off the boilers of steam engines . The lake is fifty miles long , and this is the central part of it . Besides , even if we walked to one end , we'dp259still have to cross a river , and crossing a river is a hell of a lot more complicated  --  believe me  --  than crossing a lake . At least the lake stands still . " Apart from his explanation of why the lake was warmer in the middle than at its edges , what Jesse said sounded reasonable . So they set to building a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they swam . " That 's hardwood , " pronounced Hardesty over a bunch of logs that Jesse was dragging toward the assembly point on the beach . ( Jesse himself could hardly be seen through the thicket of gray  --  he looked like a porcupine with a purple skin disease . ) " It wo n't float . " " Hardwood ? Ha ! This is Montana balsam . It 's what they use in the interior of dirigibles and such . Of course it will float . " They lashed it together with spare reepschnur cord , and pushed it from the rocks into the water , never to see it again , for it went down like heavy chain . Then they started to swim . The sun was setting , but they had decided to get wet anyway , and build a big fire on the other side , since there was plenty of Montana balsam all around . Jesse said it would n't burn , which assured Hardesty of a comfortable blaze by which to warm himself . Wrapping their clothes in bundles to put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the water , knapsacks balanced on their shoulders . In theory , only the bottom of the packs would get wet . But that theory lasted only for the ten minutes that they could swim fast . Then , at the center of the lake , they sank deeper into the water , and everything got drenched . The water there was as cold as a mountain stream at midnight on the last day of January . The colder they got , the faster Jesse talked in what sounded like a high-speed collision between a physics textbook and a politician . " I know this may sound like an excuse , " he said . " But tensor functions in higher differential topology , as exemplified by applicationof the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem to Todd Polynomials , indicate that cohometric axial rotation in nonadiabatic thermal upwelling can , by random inference derived from translational equilibrium aggregates , array in obverse transitional order the thermodynamic characteristics of a transactional plasma undergoing negative entropy conversions . "  | " Why do n't you just shut up , " said Hardesty . Jesse did n't open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes near their fire collapsed , and his purple knickers burned up . From that time forward , he went bare below the waist except for a New Guinea style penis shield that he fashioned from a discarded Dr Pepper can and hung from his waist on a piece of reepschnur . He soon took to extolling this form of dress as if he were a Seventh Avenue designer introducing a new line . " It 's very comfortable , " he said . " You should try it . " Two hours after the fire burned out , a thundering mass of steel wheels and coughing diesels swung by the lakeshore , and Jesse and Hardesty found a comfortable flatcar to carry them toward , Yellowstone . Hardesty got up first , and Jesse ran by the side of the tracks , flagging dangerously , until Hardesty hoisted him aboard . Hardesty was easily able to see him , because his buttocks shone in the light of the moon . Twenty-four hours later they jumped off the train rather than ride north into Montana and Canada , walked for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the Yellowstone River . Hardesty looked up at the sky , which seemed to be threatening rain . " Why do n't we build a shelter , and see what we can do about crossing this river tomorrow ? " he said . " I think it 's going to rain . " " Rain ! You think that looks like rain ? " Jesse asked . " Obviously , you never were in the mountains for very long . I know that it ca n't rain . Do you know what infallibility is ? I 'll tell you : it 's me predicting the weather . " He glanced at the huge cumulonimbus clouds rolling toward them from the north in a mountainlike wall that shredded up the moonlight . " That 's going to pass in five minutes . Tonight will be pure velvet . Stretch out on the pine needles and sleep . " " I do n't know , " Hardesty said , wary of the clouds . " Trust me . " Half an hour after they had fallen asleep , a crack of thunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying and turned them over like flapjacks . Lightning struck in machine-gun reports , felling trees . The river , which had already been a whipping , dashing flume , was now so fast and white that it looked like a streak of lightning itself . And the rain that came down was not ordinaryp261rain that falls in inoffensive drops . Hardesty and Jesse tried as best they could not to drown . " Follow me , " Jesse said through a mouthful of water . " What for ? " " I know where there 's shelter . I saw it on the way in . " They swam uphill for a few hundred yards until they got to the entrance of a cave . " I do n't want to go in there , " Hardesty proclaimed , although he knew he would go in . " Why not ? It 's perfectly safe . " " I 've always hated caves . I guess it 's because I 'm Italian . " " Come on . I 've been in this cave before , I think . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he left a couple of nice feather beds , supplies , furniture , and lamps . " " Sure , " Hardesty said , as darkness swallowed them up . " Why do we have to go in so far ? " " To get to the hermit 's place . " " What about bats ? " " There are n't any bats west of the Platte . " " That 's not true . I 've seen bats in San Francisco . " " Or east of Fresno . " After twenty minutes of groping along dark paths in a hissing subworld of hidden streams and mocking echoes , they came to what they sensed was a great chamber , for the sounds of their footsteps fled away from them as if into the open air . They felt vast space above and to the sides , and no matter which way they walked they found no walls but only level floor of rock and earth . They crossed small well-behaved streams as warm as bathwater and saw in them glowing chains of phosphorescent creatures . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own light , blinking by the hundreds of thousands in busy silent codes . They seemed like an army of dedicated workers absorbed in preparations for an unspecified journey . Batteries of little lights that racked up billions upon billions of permutations and combinations seemed to be driving unhindered toward some mysterious goal . For hours , or perhaps days , Hardesty and his guide wandered on the plain of lighted streams . Jesse completely forgot about thep262hermit 's place . All they cared for was the color , the endless map of calculating rivulets , and the routes of tranquillity and silence that they followed into pitch-black emptiness . Like musical tones , the streams mixed and separated . Hardesty clutched the small pack in which he carried the salver . At one point , they stood in the middle of a glowing plain so vast that they wondered if , in fact , they were still alive . But eventually they had to think about returning to the surface . Hardesty suggested that they walk against the flow of the largest stream . That way , they would at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luminescent net began to drop away , the one they followed grew larger , the phosphorescence gradually disappeared , and they found themselves in a huge chamber at a distant end of which flashes of lightning were visible through an opening . " This is perfect , " Jesse said . " A nice soft floor , dry , and the exit is right over there . Let 's go to sleep . " " Do n't you think , " Hardesty asked , " that we should light a match , to see what 's in here ? " " What could be in here ? There 's nothing in here . " " I do n't want to go to sleep without knowing what 's around me . " " That 's stupid , " Jesse yelled . " Hey ! Whatever 's in here , to hell with you ! Go to hell ! Kill us if you like ! Arrragghh ! " For a small man , he had a miraculous voice . The challenges made Hardesty 's ears ring . " Even so , " Hardesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matches , " I want to take a look . " He struck a match . At first the white-and-blue spark blinded them , but then the golden flame strengthened , and they looked up . " I see , " Hardesty said quietly . In lines as neat and well ordered as the rows of cardinals seated at an ecumenical council , were a hundred or more surprised , temporarilyblinded , twelve-foot-high grizzly bears . Not knowing what to think of the two strangers who had come into their midst , they turned to each other for advice , pawed the air , and rotated their heads in confusion . Hoping to keep away the bears , Hardesty lit as many matchesp263as he could hold in his palpitating fingers . The augmented light enabled him to see the bats . The bats , not surprisingly , numbered in the hundreds of thousands , or in the millions . They clung to the roof of the cave in a solid mass several bats deep ; they were the size of the broken umbrellas that one sees stuffed in trash cans on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hideously purple and pink . They began to move in a growing chain reaction which prompted the bears to roar , showing white teeth as sharp as a splintered hayrack . When the matches were exhausted , the bears converged and the bats began to fly . Smothered in brown fur and silky wings , Hardesty and Jesse realized that they were not being attacked , but , rather , that they had started a panic . A torrent of bats and bears burst from the cave , like boiling mud spit from a volcano . Hardesty and Jessie were thrown out the entrance onto a pile of rocks illuminated by bolts and sheets of stroboscopic lightning . After the animals were out , Jesse suggested that they go back into the cave to sleep . " I suppose you do n't think they 'll come back , do you ? " " I would say the chances of that are only about fifty-fifty . " " You do what you want . I 'm going to sleep right here on this sharp rock . " The next morning , Hardesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbing two pinecones together . When that failed , he tried to get a spark by hitting a rock with a stick . Finally , Hardesty found some more matches , and they were able to make a fire that did n't burn down the forest only because everything was so wet . They still had to cross the river . " We should walk downriver to try to find a bridge , " Hardesty suggested . " Although the chances of the river getting narrower upstreamare obviously greater , the altitude 's going to increase , which probably means less settlement , whereas , downriver , there will likely be highways , easier terrain on the banks , and maybe a stretch that 's calm enough for us to swim or shallow enough to wade . " " That shows what you know , " Jesse answered with considerable indignation , since he was the professional guide , and they were in his mountains . " There is n't a bridge that we can use for two hundred miles up or down this river . If you walk against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mossy cliffs . To the south , it gets wider and stronger as tributaries join in . You 'd have to go to Utah before you 'd find a place still enough to wade . " " Then what do you propose ? " " Doing what I always do , what I 've done a hundred times in situations like this , what anyone who really knows the mountains would do almost automatically . " " What ? " " Build a catapult . " " To throw us across ? " Hardesty asked . " That 's right . " " It 's a quarter of a mile wide ! " " So ? " " Let 's say we could make a catapult that would do the job . All right . It throws us across . What do you think 's going to happen then ? I do n't know what trajectory you plan , but we could be falling from very high . We 'd be killed instantly . " " No we would n't , " said Jesse . " Why not ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite bank ? All we have to do is ride on shock pancakes , with extended reticular netting to catch in the trees . " " Shock pancakes . " " I 'll show you . " Jesse then set immediately to building the catapult , the shock pancakes , reticular netting , lean-to 's , and access paths . Although Hardesty did n't believe for a minute that anything would work , he was carried away by Jesse 's confidence , his surety in constructing the various travesties , and the splendid , classical , intriguingidea of a machine that would enable them to fly . For two weeks they labored without sleep , eating little except the notebook-sized pieces of jerked beef , tea , and the trout that they pulled from the river . At first , Jesse insisted on cooking the trout with body heat during the night ( according to him , an old Indian method ) . " There are better ways , " said Hardesty , who then showed his guide how to plank fish . At the center of a new clearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and piles . They had felled many trees andp265stripped miles of vines with which to build a two-story frame supporting a one-hundred-foot tree that pivoted on a huge beam . A basket containing several tons of rock held the shorter end down until the long tree was winched close to the ground and fixed there as taut as a crossbow . Shock pancakes and reticulated nets were attached to the catapult head . They looked like wicker-weave lily pads ten feet thick and forty feet in diameter . Hardesty and Jesse were to be strapped onto them with guy wires of orange and black mountainclimbingrope . To protect themselves further , they made big balloonlikesuits of soft underbark that they wrapped around themselves over alternating layers of moss and puffballs . These " cushions , " as Jesse called them , were so big and unwieldy that they had to be kept on top of the shock pancakes , or Jesse and Hardesty would never have been able to climb on . All in all , Hardesty was skeptical , and refused to commit himself to launch . But in the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk to Utah , he decided to take his chances in a moss-andpuffball suit on a shock pancake thrown into the air by a giant catapult . Besides , the thing was insanely alluring . At the appointed hour , they climbed the launching pad , put on their suits , and tied themselves in . Jesse had in hand a lanyard that would yank a wooden cotter pin from the trigger mechanism , and send them flying . " You see that clump of green over there ? " he asked , indicating a soft-looking bed of young pine . " That 's where we 'll land . Our descent through the air will be slowed by the aerodynamically stable design of the nets and pancakes . The nets will grapple the trees , and the pancakes will take the force out of any direct impact . Needless to say , these suits are the ultimate protection . " If you 're frightened , do n't be . I 'm an engineer , and I 've got this figured to the last decimal point . Are you ready ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 've got to adjust this group of puffballs here . Okay . I 'm ready now . Mind you , I think you 're a lunatic , and I do n't know why I 'm trust . . . t . . . . " Jesse yanked the lanyard , and they were thrown with tremendousforce , not upward into the air , but directly into the river , about fifty feet from shore . They hit the water like an artillery shell , throwing a geyser ofp266white foam a hundred feet high , and they , the pancakes , and the nets were quickly submerged deep in the rapids . Luckily for them , the whole package was righted in the neutral buoyancy , and when they surfaced they found themselves floating head-up . Racing downstream , tied into their suits and onto the pancakes , and unable to move , they were conscious only because the freezing water had revivedthem after the first shock . Hardesty started to struggle out of his suit . " Do n't ! " Jesse screamed . " You 'll drown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Go to hell ! " " Seriously ! " " Seriously ? " Hardesty was frozen with accumulated anger , annoyance , disbelief , and disgust . " Seriously ? " " Take my advice or you 'll be in for trouble . " " You do n't think that riding at forty miles an hour down icecoldrapids , on shock pancakes , in puffball suits , is trouble ? You know what you are ? I 'll tell you . You 're an incompetent . You do n't do anything right . " " I ca n't help it if I was born short , " Jesse screamed back over the roar of the waters . " Tall people are n't so great just because they 're a few feet higher . " Hardesty exploded . " It has nothing to do with short or tall ! " Then he realized that they were about to float under a bridge that could not have been more than a mile or two from the catapult . Little girls in rhubarb-colored glasses peered over the railings , fascinated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you call that ? " Hardesty asked . " That 's a toll bridge . I do n't know about you , but I do n't throw good money after bad . " Too exhausted to continue shouting over the sounds of the rapids , Hardesty slumped in his puffball suit , staring with tired eyes at scenery that rushed by as if seen from a railroad train . Just as he was thinking that the situation was n't so bad , because in a day or two they might hit calm water and be able to swim to the east bank , he saw that the river up ahead disappeared completely . The water justp267stopped , and a shocking picture of empty air and faraway clouds continued in its place . " Ryerson Falls , " said Jesse . " Three-quarters of a mile high . I never went over them in a puffball suit . " Hardesty was torn between wanting to strangle Jesse , and trying to gather his thoughts before death so that upon quitting the earth he could cry out something beautiful and true , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amused smile . He was able to find the intensity and beauty that he wanted , in the plunge itself . Physical forces in a complicated coalition of gravity , acceleration , and temperature were powerful and intense enough to satisfy him . It made sense . Nothing was as comforting as the enduring purity of elemental forces , and returning to them could not mean defeat . But he never thought that he would die in a bark suit , strapped to a shock pancake , next to an incompetent midget . They went over a dizzying edge , and found themselves in the empty air . As they fell , they sometimes hit the water that was falling next to them and were tipped one way or another . The farther down Hardestywent , the greater his hope that , having come as far as he had , he would survive . In the last few feet , although he was going very fast , his hopes skyrocketed because the water was so close . The bottom of the falls was a blizzard of foam and bubbles in water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air a hundred feet below the surface . Their buoyant contraption was eventuallyhurled upward , and they popped up in the middle of the stream half a mile from the falls , greatly startling two fishermen  --  who were n't sure what they had seen , but knew that it was as big as a car , and seemed to be driven by two backward-facing humanoid figures in strange uniforms . They landed in a place that was full of geysers , mud holes , and pits of boiling sulfur . Without even looking at Jesse , Hardesty got out of his puffball suit , slung his pack over his shoulder , and set out toward the east . " It 's not a good idea to go in that direction , " he heard Jesse calling out from behind . " You 'd do best to follow me . You have to have years of experience to walk on these crusts . Otherwise , you canp268go right through . It 's more dangerous than walking on a minefield , and you 've got no training . Look at all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honey . AFTER six months on a sheep ranch in Colorado , Hardesty had earned enough and been in one place for a long enough time to set out east again . The owners of the ranch , a young couple whose names were Henry and Agnes , had needed him to help bring the sheep down from high pasture , to take in the hay , and to do whatever else had to be done before the snows . But when , in November , winter came in tentative fashion , laying down snowfields that were swept away by a weakening sun , they needed him no longer . Anyway , Agnes was far too pretty for the sanity and dignity of a hired man without a wife of his own . So they took him in their ancient wooden station wagon to a railhead somewhere at the foot of the Sangre de Cristo range , from where he rode in a single diesel-powered freight and mail car , sitting on the plank floor next to the conductor , to a larger town through which passed the last of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young conductor said , " the Polaris will speed through here faster than a burning rabbit . If you want the stationmasterto flag it down for you , you 'll have to tell him in plenty of time , because he has to climb to the top of the water tower with his lantern to do it . " Hardesty bought a new pair of pants in the town store . His jeans were so soaked with lanolin that he used them to make a fire by the side of the tracks , where he waited for the Polaris as it grew dark . He was used to sitting very still at the higher altitudes where Henry and Agnes kept their sheep , and he knew how to out-think the cold  --  with the help of a massive shearling coat that had been given to him as a part of his pay . The trance he used to defy temperaturerobbed some senses to pay others . He felt nothing , but he could see and hear everything . And because of that he was able to detect the Polaris long before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its blinding headlight made a faintly shifting glow in the mountains far away , and its barely audible , attenuated sounds camep269drifting through the night air to unsettle the dogs and to alert Hardesty , who got the stationmaster to climb the water tower and light his lantern . The swinging red lantern eye charmed from the mountains a dancing white blaze that ran across the plain , slewing its agile beam on every curve to trim the young winter wheat and catch the animals of the field by riveting in place their translucent green eyes . As it closed without losing speed , the stationmaster yelled down from the tower , " Do n't be disappointed if he does n't stop . Sometimes they just do n't see my lantern . They go so damn fast , this is such a little town , and when they 're on the eastern run they pass through here right after dinner . I guess it makes them a little sleepy . " But he kept waving his lantern from the top of the tower , swaying his entire body , even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They saw it ! " the stationmaster yelled down . " Start runnin ' that way . The last car will be a mile down the track before it stops . " Hardesty ran alongside the squealing , decelerating train . The yellow lamps of the dining cars made the snow in front of him the color of an oilcloth slicker . Glancing up , he could see people at dinner , some lifting bottles of wine , some pressing their faces against the windows in vain efforts to see why they were stopping , some with cloth napkinsheld to their lips . The last car passed him very slowly . Streamlinedinto a teardrop , it had above the lantern on its rounded end a lighted glass nameplate that read " Polaris , " as if it were the title of a film on a movie marquee . A porter pulled him in through a bullet-shaped door , and hit the go signal . By the time the door was closed , the train was clacking down the track , and had restored the smooth heartbeat of the plains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " New York . " " Most people that get on in the middle of nowhere do n't go to New York . Maybe Kansas City , and that 's a big thing for them , but New York ? Uh-uh . You got enough money ? " " What 's the fare ? " " I ca n't tell from this place . It 's not on my card . I 'll send the conductor , and he 'll calculate it . Meanwhile , you ca n't ride in the club car , so come with me , and wait in the vestibule . "  |p270As  they walked through the club car , an old man in black stopped the porter . " Kindly leave him here , Ramsey . We 'll take care of him . " " Mr. Cozad ? " the porter asked , in surprise . " We need a fourth for our game . " The old man spoke in a voice colored by three-quarters of a century in west Texas . " Have a seat , young man , " he said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . The leather was comfortable and soft . Still throbbing and red from his run in the cold , Hardesty loosened the sheepskin coat , then decided to take it off entirely , and put it and his pack near the window . The club car was a purple and black canister dotted with incandescentlamps in red shades . The silver-haired old men who played cards were in dark suits : their hands moved about as if disconnected , and their faces were like white masks floating above an unlighted stage . The light seemed to be fueled by the rhythm of the rails , its frequency determined by the ticking of the track joints . The cards themselves glowed mysteriously , like phosphorescent bones , and the faces of the kings , queens , and jacks smiled like Cheshire cats . " Like a gin and tonic ? " asked Cozad . " No , thank you , " Hardesty replied . " I do n't drink . " " Something else then ? " " Tea . " Cozad ordered tea , which was brought to Hardesty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bass . " You do play cards . " " I do n't , " Hardesty said . " Not as a matter of religion , but because I just do n't . " They were astounded that there could be such a thing as a plains cowboy , riding in their club car , who did not play cards . " Young man , " Cozad said , " I never met anyone above the age of five who could n't play poker . You 're not trying to make it easier for yourself , are you ? " " No , sir , " Hardesty said . " I never played enough to remember the rules . " " But you did play . "  |p271Hardesty  shrugged his shoulders . " Mainly fish : that is to say the game of fish . I 'm not describing my opponents . " " There 's a game called fish ? " " Yes . " " Never heard of it . What about seven-card stud ? " Warmed and incited by the tea , Hardesty asserted , " I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn , could n't I. " He smiled . Cozad tapped the green leather table as he spoke . " I do n't think you 're a sharper . But if you are , you 're in the right place , because we  --  me and Lawson here , and George  --  have a reputation that frightens most people away from us . What we count on is some young ram with a lot of his father 's money , who thinks he can beat us . This train has proved empty of rams . You are n't one . I can tell just by lookin ' . But we do n't like to play without a new face . That 's our invitation . " " I have only two hundred and sixty dollars , " Hardesty said , " and I 've got to pay my fare . " " We could put the calf in the ring , Coe , " Lawson said . " What 's that ? " Hardesty asked . " It does n't sound so good to me " What that is , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set you up with a stake so you can play . If you lose , you owe us nothing , and you yourself lose nothing . If you win , you pay us back and keep the rest . It 's how we teach our sons to play . " After ten minutes of drill in five-card high-low draw , they bankrolled him with $10,000 . Being a Marratta , he did n't bat an eyelash at that kind of money , and they were momentarily suspicious . But they knew every decent player in the country , and would have been grateful ( had he been able to beat them ) to have found a new one . Word would have flashed from one end of the continent to another that a young power was on the rise . " Okay , " said Cozad . " Whatever is , is , and whatever is not , is not . It 's started to snow out there . Turn up the stove . This game ends at mile marker five on the west side of St. Louis : not before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a limit of ninety thousand dollars . Food and beverage on the dealer . Draw for deal . "  |p272Peo|ple  thought that gamblers were no good because they did n't work . But anyone who thought this had obviously never stayed up all night between Denver and St. Louis staying sharp on the cards . It was sore comfort . The forward hurtling of a train through blinding snow and arctic winds was hypnosis in itself , and the warm club car , as quiet as a library , did not encourage taking risks . The snow-coveredcountry outside was a rough place where it was possible to die just from the wind , and animals there were lowing just as if there had never been any men on earth . If a switchman someplace in Nebraskawere to have overslept , the train might easily have flown off a fifty-foot bank . People did n't like gamblers , because gamblers remindedthem that they were gamblers , too . So they invented the libel that gambling is n't work . It is work . It 's worse than work . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this out . His throat grew sore and his muscles started to ache . His head felt as if it had been bolted to his spine by a Visigoth mechanic . But all the time that he played cards on a green leather table as the Polaris shot across short-grass country in the long white night , he knew that he was doing what he was supposed to be doing . It was not just that Cozad , with his patrician 's beard and gentle eyes , was remarkably like his father . Nor was it that he was winning , and he was . It was , instead , that he had given himself to fortune entirely . And it had much to do with the hard beauty of the prairie outside . He could n't see much more than the surprised coils of snow dashing against the window like panicked sagebrush , and he sweated , because the old men ( who were cold despite their angora vests ) wanted the heat on as high as it could go . He put his cards down on the table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the tea and the sound of the rails had gotten to him . But he was winning . He never slipped below six thousand . Then he began to build over that , steadily , without fail , in complete blind confidence . " Which is higher , four of a kind or a flush ? " he might ask , much embarrassed that the rules had n't stuck with him . For several hours , the old men lost a lot because they thought that he knew how to bluff . But he never bluffed once , he just won  --  if not the high hand , then the low hand . Once , when one of the old men had a flushp273with the queen as top card , Hardesty had a royal flush . If one of the old men had a hand of irredeemable garbage , Hardesty would throw out worse garbage , sometimes only by a point , or not even that if it were a tie and the issue was decided by who had put out first . " Things like this happen , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five just west of St. Louis , and the game ended . Hardesty tried to give back his winnings . They would n't let him . They got off in St. Louis . " Go to the bank in the station and get a check for that sum made out to you , " Cozad instructed . " People have been killed for a lot less . And another thing : it was just luck . An armadillo can play better cards than you can . Be grateful . " Hardesty was saddened when Cozad left , because Cozad looked like his father , and he would never see either one of them again . He went to a bank near the station to get his check , came back , bought himself a compartment on the train , and tipped the porters the way gambling winners were supposed to . He took a long shower , shaved , and went to bed . Winter air and daylight came in the partially open window until the compartmentwas blinding white and freezing cold . Hardesty peered from his warm bed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was drawn on the Harvesters and Planters Bank of St. Louis , and it was for $70,000 , even . He had a few thousand in cash in the other pocket . The ground was covered with snow outside of St. Louis and on into Illinois . He had asked the porter to awaken him only in New York . The sleep that he wanted was perhaps not deserved , but it was well paid for . Long before they reached Chicago , he was dreaming of the darkened club car , the glowing cards , and the blood-red lamps . EARLY one morning in the beginning of the second winter that she had spent without Virginia , Mrs. Gamely arose and peered out the attic window . She held Jack the rooster in her arms as if he were a fat white cat . After Virginia left , she had spoiled him silly , feeding him corn until he could hardly walk , and talking to him for hours on end as if he could understand her inimitable polysyllabic Latinates and her short , strong , Anglo-Saxon phrases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's arm . He had at least one quality which humans , especially students , might well have envied : no matter how many hours she talked , he would stare directly at her , transfixed . If there were a pause in her exposition , he would strut for a pace or two until she started up again , and then freeze in place with a look of rapture until the next silence allowed him to shift his foot or cluck to clear his throat . No chicken in her remembrance ( and she could remember thousands of chickens individually ) had ever had such an extraordinary attention span . Jack earned his keep . He was clever . He looked like a panorama of snow-covered hills behind which a blazing sun was just about to set ( the effect of his red coxcomb ) . He was courteous , forbearing , bright , and sincere . And , had he been able to understand English , he would have learned a great deal . Mrs. Gamely had secrets that she had never shared even with Virginia , because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . After five days , the snow finally stopped a foot short of the eaves . When Mrs. Gamely looked west she saw the village standing firm in a sea of white , its chimneys smoking busily with the breakfast fires , the inhabitants barely visible as they stood upon their roofs to survey the arctic lake . It was said that the second winter was going to be harder than the first . Predictions such as this had been nurtured into gigantism by a summer so hot that the lake water was scalding and chickens laid soft-boiled eggs . That August , houses , trees , and sometimes whole forests had suddenly burst into flame as if the sun had been beaming at them through Priestley 's glass . " So the pendulumwill swing , " said Mrs. Gamely to Jack , as they watched the wind whipping at the snow . " And so it has swung . Forever a balance . Nature hangs on stubbornly to rhetoric and ethics , even if human populations have long abandoned them , and its grammar is strict and idiosyncratic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills of snow . God is treating us to fire and ice . He must be agitated . He must have something in mind . " A sharp knock on the front door startled her into a violent hiccup . She put her hand to her chest and said , " Daythril Moobcot tunneled . " Racing through the cottage as fast as she could , she wondered why they had come through so early , and hoped that it wasp275not because of any bad news . When she opened the door , there was Daythril Moobcot , standing in an ice-blue tunnel that went all the way to the village . " Daythril ! When did you start this tunnel ? " " Two days ago , Mrs. Gamely . " " Why ? I have plenty of provisions . You know it 's unwise to tunnel in a blizzard . You 're old enough to remember when Hagis Purgin and Ranulph Vonk were buried in their own tunnel and were n't found until spring . Always wait to see how much snow there 'll be on top . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving around because we heard over the telegraph that the blizzard caught the Polaris somewhere within the county lines . There are two hundred people on it . If they 're still alive , we 'll be bringing them to the village . Can you take in five or six until the plough train gets through ? " " Naturally I can . They wo n't be too comfortable , but so what , they 'll be alive . How are they going to get from the railroad to the village ? The shortest distance it could possibly be is fifteen miles . Wo n't it be the death of all those city people in their city clothes to come that distance in deep snow at forty-five below ? " " No , ma'am , " said Daythril Moobcot , proudly . " We 've been planning for two days . Fifty men left an hour ago . They 're pulling twenty-five sleds loaded with food , warm clothing , and skis that we scrounged up or made . When they get to the railroad line , two scouts will be waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent the two fastest skiers in the village . One of them will have found the train , and will lead the others to it . They 'll bring everyone back , in the dark . It 'll take a long time , since most of them probably do n't know how to ski . " " I 'll set out the bedding , " Mrs. Gamely said . " And I 'd better start baking right away . They 'll need some hot breads and a boiling stew , especially if they 've had nothing to eat for a few days . Will they know what has happened to them , and where they are ? " " I doubt it . " " No matter . The ones with good souls will find out , and those who do n't know , do n't need to know . " She closed the door and began to rush about , assembling the best of her provisions , lighting her bee oven , and whipping up an ambrosial batter.  |p276DURING  the five days of blizzard the trainmen and passengers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food and burned all the coal that had been in the hopper car . Now , huddled together in two sleeping coaches , they were wrapped in blankets , curtains , and rugs , and they faced small fires in improvised wood stoves fueled by ripped-up paneling and sacrificed baggage . The engineerhad nearly frozen to death finding the telegraph line , only to discover that it was dead . Half a dozen men with pistols fitted to improvised stocks sat in the bright sunlight on top of the train , just about even with the snow , waiting for arctic hares and birds . As a result of their labor , three quail and a rabbit were boiling at length in a caldron down below . The idea was to cook the flesh out of existence , so that the watery soup could then be justly divided ( infants were well fed from a special reserve of food that would remain until the last adult was unable to feed them ) . Cold and hunger in concert had quickly brought forth the essentialqualities of those upon whom they were visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after they had foolishly set out in the snow and frozen to death , unseen , in drifts only a hundred feet from the train . A woman had surrendered to madness ( or perhaps had been mad to start ) , quite a few were deathly ill , and one man was dead from gunshot wounds he suffered while trying to steal food from the common store . Those were the casualties . The trainmen , however , faced their responsibilities selflessly . And others were equally heroic in caring for the sick , giving up rations and blankets , and working to counter the influence of people who were easily disheartened . After the snow stopped , Hardesty spent most of his time on top of the train , scanning the sky and drifts for game . Neither he nor the other hunters talked . They were too far apart , they did n't want to scare off their quarry , and it was too cold for conversation anyway . They wondered to themselves how long it would stay so frigid that the plough train would not be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred miles distant , and they knew that it was toop277cold for machines to fly , since all forms of lubrication had become stickier than taffy . They sat bundled in parkas and blankets , watching their breath crystallize in front of them and remembering the five-day blizzard , when fine snow blown into perfect equilibrium by balanced and opposingwinds had seemed to hesitate in midair and freeze the passage of time . They watched the sun traverse a subdued winter arc , and , occasionally , thinking that they had seen a rabbit , they fired their pistols into the snow . In this area it sometimes remained fifty below or less for weeks at a time . They knew that even if every single one of their remaining bullets had found its mark in a fat hare , there would not have been food sufficient for a day . Most distressing was that the fittings and freight would be burned up by the next morning , and there simply was not enough bedding or winter clothing to keep fifty people from freezing to death , much less two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functional , unburied , unblocked equipment that could travel over snow , would he know to go to them ? Would they be an important priority , and could the many miles between the nearest settlement and the stranded train be covered in time ? It seemed to those who could reason that everyone there was soon to die . Down below in the disheveled sleeping coaches , they did n't know how fast the train was being gutted , or how terribly cold it was outside , or that drifts forty feet high were all that anyone on the roof of the train could see . Still , they took comfort from their number . Two hundred people , together , were safe , they thought . But Hardesty knew that this was a mistake , for his father had told him of the thirty thousand Turkish soldiers on the Russian frontier , near Ararat , who had been surprised by an early mountain winter and had later been found , grouped together , frozen to death . Cold , he knew , had never been impressed by numbers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagining at times that they were on a polar sea . Their hands and feet were long numbed , and had ceased to tingle . It was hard to believe that such freezing white light came from what they had once known as thep278sun . When this sun was most of the way through its short winter arc , and was so flat , cool , and tame that it looked like a metal disc trapped for show on the face of a grandfather clock , the men on the roof of the train prepared for the worst . Soon it would be dark , and the cold unbearable . Soon the fires would stutter and go out , sending up a last gray column of cooling smoke . The sun , their only hope , was quickly heading downward . They stared in its direction , trying to harvest the last of its light and warmth , but it was a cold and unfamiliar thing , and the hiss of the wind seemed like its dying exhalations . Hypnotized and blinded , utterly still , they did not immediately see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miles away , a line of strong winter-bred farmers moved in military formation , kicking and gliding on their long skis , dipping down into the depressions in the snow and taking them at speed to get momentum for the trip up . They came as steadily as a herd of reindeer or gazelles . Fifty men pulled twenty-five sleds . Stretched out in a wide phalanx with a sled between each pair , they looked like hills and mountains on the move , or a tide of trees . Breathing intently , they swept over the snow , heading for the stranded train  --  which the eastern scout had seen from a hill five miles to the northwest . He had then skied down to meet the others , who had set off on a ten-mile race with the sun at their backs . When the train appeared to them , it seemed to be floating upon the drifts , swamped , and the thin lines of smoke rising from it seemed about to expire . In this strangely immobilized excursion craft were two hundred men , women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . Making for them with all their strength , the farmers thought that danger was in truth a lovely thing that had to do with air and clouds and sea . As they closed , the men on the train began to hear their skis , their breathing , and the sound of the snow compressing as the columnmoved across it fifty abreast . They thought that it was the wind , risen to mark the sunset . Then they thought that it was an animal . When they finally could see through the glare , they could hardly believe their eyes . From the sheer white , from nothing , from ap279hundred miles of rolling drifts , an army of nearly silent skiers was closing upon them . The men on the train cried out , but the sounds that came from their frozen throats were just gurgles and moans , so they began to fire their pistols in the air , one shot after another . Upon hearing this , the Coheeries men began to whoop and cheer as they raced along on their skis . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with piled snow , everyone knew what was happening , and quite a few of them began to weep , laugh , and even pray . The cars erupted in commotion , and those who had imagined that they were lost climbed out the hatches to stand in the open air and greet their rescuers . Who were these men in homespun and fur ? There was no time to explain ( they never would ) if they were to get back to the settlementwithout too much traveling at night . " The moon is full , and it will light up the countryside like a flare , " one of the Coheeries men said to the train crew ( who had never heard of Lake of the Coheeries ) . " But it 's best to start off in the light , so that those who do n't know how to ski can learn when it 's warmer . We have skis for everyone , and we 'll pull the sick and the children in sleds . " In an hour , everyone was fitted with skis , supplied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chocolate , instructed , sledded , and eager to start out . They did not whistle across the drifts as their Coheeries rescuers had done , but , by evening , they were moving at a steady pace . Three Coheeries men led in a vee , carrying-torches for everyone to follow . The others pushed a flat track across forests and fields , migrating in starlight , following the three pitch-pine torches and their ragged orange flames . The moon came up as they were emergingfrom a huge stand of pine onto a flat ten-mile-wide whitened plateau . The landscape was glowing , but they kept the torches because they looked so lovely sparkling ahead , and by that time the pace had increased and everyone had grown used to chasing the three I fights . The city people , clad now in furs and wool , quickly grew ac/customed to the melancholy brush of moonlight and the soft overwhelminglight of the stars . They soon grew to love the cold air and the snow , and they quickly forgot why they were there . Their activitywas self-justifying , far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do in the future . They quarter-timed across the fields , with the aurora borealis faintly green and flashing off to their right . Then , from atop a long rise , they saw the village sparkling like a group of colored candles . It was on the edge of the lake , which was crowned by the blue-and-green aurora now hanging in the sky in astounding silent ribbons . Smoke from Coheeries chimneys crept up in intertwining white garlands and tangled on the moon . Now skiers , countrymen , they raced in contentment , hissing down the slope , speeding toward the Christmas candle that danced before them by the frozen lake , and as they skied into the town they saw the people of the village standing on their roofs or in their bright windows . When skis were stacked near the doorways , families reunited , and groups formed , they went inside to eat and rest . Having been without food for days , many were starry-eyed and entranced . They thought they were in a dream world . How pleasant it was . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was death , then how lovely , and how much better than any life they had known , for it was something that seemed to be flooded with light , and in it all emotions had an inexplicable buoyancy . " No , " they were told . " You 're not dead . Far from it . " But they did n't know whether to believe these good people , and when they went inside they yearned to be out again under the stars , in the cold that seemed no longer capable of hurting them . H A R D E S T Y and four others were escorted through the snow tunnel to Mrs. Gamely 's . When he , a cuckoo-clock repairman from Milwaukee , a young Marine , and a married pair of Bengali tourists strained their eyes and peered into the firelit interior of Mrs. Gamely'scottage , they saw Mrs. Gamely standing by the stove , with Jack held in her arms in front of her . The way she looked ( with her tooclose-togethereyes , and an expression of humility and mischief per/fectly combined ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its nest . She stepped forward and bowed neatly to each of her guests  --  as shyly as a little girl in patent-leather shoes at her first dance in some echoing gymnasium . They reciprocated . They sensed something about Lake of the Coheeries , but did n't know what it was . So they were very cautious , and returned her bows as deferentially as explorers straining to emulate a custom of the bushmen . It occurred to Mrs. Gamely to seize upon this unusual willingness to oblige her , and she repeated the greetings . They followed suit . When she went down the line yet again , bowing gracefully each time , they had to respond in the same way . This went on for at least five minutes , until Mrs. Gamely ( as bemused as she could be ) noticed that one of her guests was missing . Looking about , she saw a handsome young man sitting at the table , filling one of the new clay pipes . As he watched the bowing , he grew more and more delighted at Mrs. Gamely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he understood her . One might think that the sudden arrival of five unknown guests would prompt a flood of talk from an old woman who had been alone for more than a year , especially if she , like Mrs. Gamely , had a vocabulary of six hundred thousand words . But she had many hours each day in which to talk to Jack and to herself , and since she was the only one in the world who could understand exactly what she was saying without raping the dictionary as she spoke , she seldom unleashedher full range of words on passersby . Instead , she devoured their speech , milking them like cows for the secrets of their dialects and regional usages . She put five new words in her store from the cuckoo-clock repairman alone  --  escambulint , tintinex , walatonian , smerchoo , and fuck-head ( all of which , save the last , were Milwaukee terms referring to the various parts of cuckoo clocks ) . The Bengalis were a gold mine . Their English , like waving silks and Birdsong , so entranced Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly collapsed because they could hardly get anything to eat . " What do you call that , in your country ? " Mrs. Gamely would ask , pointing , for example , to a steaming loaf of Coheeries bread . " Bread , " answered the husband.  | " Must be variants , " Mrs. Gamely insisted . " Well , yes , " they chirped together , and the husband went on . " When a little fellow wants bread , he says , Ta mi balabap . ' " Balabap ? " " Yes . Balabap . " " And what do you call a policeman who takes bribes ? " " A jelby . " " And a broken weir upon which swans nest ? " " A swatchit-hock . " So it went as she fed them milky-white Coheeries bread , venison stew , roasted Canadian bacon , and a tureen of mixed vegetables in venison broth . She apologized profusely for not having any salad . The worst thing about winter was that there was no salad , and try as they did the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by freezing or otherwise . For dessert , she had baked a batch of **32;10514;TOOLONG with cherry-brandy centers . But because there were six for dinner , she had used up all of her platters , and had nothing upon which to serve the cookies . Alert to the importance of such things to women of advancing age , Hardesty reached into his pack and pulled out the salver . Either because it had been polished as it had moved around in the pack , or because it was somehow changing , it seemed more dazzlingthan it had ever been . When he held it for them to see , they took in their breaths , for it caught the flamelight and the yellow glow of the kerosene lantern like a mythical shield , and its rays struck out in all directions , as busy and alive as the lightscape of a great city . What entranced them most was not the glimmering gold , but that here was a still thing which moved . It was molten , calculating , changing in front of their eyes . " That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Too beautiful just for cookies , " Mrs. Gamely added . " I could n't use a salver like that for serving cookies . " " Why not ? " asked Hardesty . " It 's not delicate . Hardly that . My brother threw it out of a seven-story window onto concrete and it was n't even scratched . It 's pure gold . It wo n't stain or tarnish . I would n't mind if you used it for serving up roast beef . Something like this , which is of the highest order , can do even the humblestp283tasks . That 's true about words , is n't it , Mrs. Gamely ? They serve peasants as well as kings . " He tossed it upon the table , where it rang for two minutes as it settled down like a spinning golden sovereign , and warmed everyone'sface as if it were a coal fire . Mrs. Gamely went to the oven and got out the cookies . As she placed them around the salver , Hardesty read and translated the virtues . When Mrs. Gamely began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inscription in the center . " Does it really say that ? " she asked . " For what can be imaginedmore beautiful than the sight of a perfectly just city rejoicing in justice alone ' ? " " Yes , " Hardesty answered . " I see . " She covered the inscription with a line of cookies , and did not mention it again . That night , as she lay in her bed upstairs , thinking about her charges sprawled on mats and blankets in the main room the way Virginia 's friends had done in the past at their pillow parties , she wondered about things she had heard as a little girl , about certain beauties that she had once been promised would arise . And with tremendous excitement and fear , she thought that these promises might come true in her lifetime , after all . She had long given up on them for herself , and hoped only that Virginia or Martin would see them . She had once believed in miracles , shining cities , and a golden age . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were only illusions . But now she was n't quite sure . A great massy wheel seemed once again to be turning . Or was it a vain and foolish misinterpretationof her past ? Probably . But , no . No . The lake had frozen . And the start of the third millennium was drawing near . Perhaps it was not an illusion , for the lake had frozen early and as black as a mirror only one other time . It was when she was a child , and the Penns had come from the city to bury Beverly Penn on their island . Tears came to her eyes as she thought of the cold night not long after the Penns had returned to New York , when she had been awakened by the pull of the stars , which hissed and crackled like an icy waterfall , and were dancing all over the sky , brighter than she had ever seen them . She was onlyp284four or five , and had to stand on tiptoe to see out the window . It was then , as she looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning of the word " arise . " THE day that Hardesty arrived in New York was cold and dry . Nevertheless , tentative whirlwinds of snow sometimes swept the avenues , twisting about in gray light . The city had not yet been interredin its January shroud , and the fact that the streets were still bare gave December the air of fall , just as reluctant snowbanks can give the air of December even to May . This was the first city he had ever seen that immediately spoke for itself , as if it had no people and were a system of empty canyons cutting across the desert in the west . The overwhelming mass of its architecture , in which time crossed and mixed , did not ask for attentionshyly , like Paris or Copenhagen , but demanded it like a centurionbarking orders . Great plumes of steam a hundred stories tall , river traffic that ran a race to silver bays , and countless thousands of intersecting streets that sometimes would break away from the grid and soar over the rivers on the flight path of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper that was straining hard to be . Hardesty knew right off that an unseen force was breathing under all the gray , that the events and miracles of the city were simply the effect of this force as it turned in its sleep , that it saturated everything , and that it had sculpted the city before it had even opened its eyes . He felt it striving in everything he saw , and knew that the entire population , though prideful of its independence , was subject to a complete and intense orchestration the likes of which he had never imagined . They rushed about here and there , venting their passions  --  struggling , kicking , and shuddering like marionettes . Ten minutes after he left the station , he saw a taxi driver kill a peddler in an argument over who had the right of way on an empty street . He wanted no part of this city . It was too gray , cold , and dangerous . It was perhaps the grayest , coldest , most dangerous city in the world . He understood why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But he was too old for such things , and he had already been to war . Furthermore , his intention was to look throughout Europe for a beautiful city that ( momentarily , at least ) might be entirely just . In such a city all forces would smoothly align , and all balances would be brought even . That would never occur in this ragged place of too much energy and too many loose ends that lashed about like taut cables which suddenly are parted . New York could never be fully at peace with itself ; nor could any one vision defeat , compress , and control its crooked and varied time , for this would require the perfect and able recognition of signal beauties , and a gift of unforeseen grace . Never would New York know perfect justice , despite the greatness of its views and its well-plotted interweaving of the magnificent and the small . For Hardesty , who was in poor spirits after a long and difficult train journey in which he had zigzagged over half of Pennsylvania and been shunted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and snowmobile repair shops , New York was a difficult city , far too rich in the ugly , the absurd , the monstrous , the hideous , and the unbearable . Everything capable of being exaggeratedor distorted , was . Normally acceptable customs and occurrences were changed into startling nightmares . The very life functions were transformed . Breathing , for example , was never taken for granted , since , half the time , thanks to the many chemical works and refineries , it was nearly impossible . Battalions of heinous voluptuaries corrupted eating into a sport of pigs . Sex was for sale as a commodity , like roasted peanuts or manganese . Even elimination , never the most regal thing , was dragged down to baser levels by snorting , grunting dilapidations who squatted mercilessly upon the sidewalk in full public view . But then the wind changed , the light came out , and he was caught up in some sort of magic . For no apparent reason , he suddenly became king of the world , and was overflowing with the schemes and riches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he was undergoing an attack . Though suddenly ecstatic , he retained enough presence of mind to try to determine why his emotions had flipped upside down . He thought it might have had something to dop286with the city itself , since everyone he could see was either weeping at death 's door or dancing with hat and cane . The city seemed to have no middle ground . Certainly the poor were poor and the rich were rich as nowhere else . But , here , wealthy women in sables and diamonds sifted through garbage cans , and paupers who slept above subway gratings strutted down the street declaiming furiously about monetary policy and the Federal Reserve . He saw great numbers of men who were women , and women who were men . And , in Madison Square Park , there were two lunatics in bedsheets , circling one anotherlike fighting cocks , screaming that they had found a magic mirror . Hardesty decided to deposit his check in a reputable bank and figure out later whether he would stay for a while in New York or immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deep whistles of which he could hear as they started downriver and across the sea more casually than canoes on a millpond . In San Francisco , walking into a bank was like walking into a palace  --  which was the way it should have been . But in New York , banks were cathedrals , which was perhaps not the way it should have been . If a law had been passed to change each bank into a church and each second vice-presidentinto a priest , New York would instantly have become the centerof Christendom . Hardesty slapped down his gambling check on a waxed marble counter in the Tenth Street branch of the Hudson and Atlantic Trust . The teller appraised it with a professional stare . " We 're not taking these , " he said . " We had a telex this morning instructing us to refuse any checks drawn on Harvesters and Planters in St. Louis . I imagine it 's gone under . I suggest that you go to our main office on Wall Street . They might be able to clarify the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he found himself on an even keel when he walked into the Hudson and Atlantic headquarters in the financial district , the only reaction appropriatefor its interior was a gasp of wonder . A cream-colored marblefloor stretched away like the wheat fields of Kansas . Messengers on bicycles carried documents and dispatches over it from one departmentto another . When a small child deliberately released a toyp287helium balloon , everyone watched it drift up to the ceiling , where it seemed as small as a grain of sand . A bank officer who did n't like the way Hardesty was dressed told him , showing a newspaper to prove it , that the St. Louis bank had failed . " You have three choices , " he said . " You can hang onto the check and become a creditor ( or hope that someday they 'll get back on their feet ) , you can sell it as an acceptance for about a cent and a half on the dollar , or you can tear it up . " Hardesty thought it best to rent a safe deposit box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty years , like a locust , it would rise to fly . And , if he could lease a box wide enough , he would put the salver in it too  --  since he did not fancy carrying around many pounds of gold and silver in a city where , it was said , every tenth citizen was a thief . Deep below the wheat-field floor were marble chambers and barred cages . Hardesty found himself in a little cell with an enormousmetal box , in which he placed the salver and the check . He looked up . From all around came chants and tones , as if prayers were being said in the warrens of a Tibetan monastery . A score or more of middle-aged men in cells like his own were counting their coupons and their certificates in low voices imbued with the gravity of final reckoning . He leaned back in his chair , lit his pipe , and listened . The sounds of shuffling and counting were as tranquil as the lapping of a lake . The occasional shuddering metallic rattle of steel grates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the whir of combination wheels was like the purring of a cat . In the dimly lit cell , Hardesty watched his pipe smoke wind to the ceiling . He stayed there for several hours , thinking about what he had to do next . In his pocket was a long letter in his own handwriting from Mrs. Gamely to Virginia . The letter itself was a puzzle , being beautifulyet utterly incomprehensible unless one were to have the humiliatingexperience of using a dictionary to understand one 's own language . It read like a runic ode , but was dotted here and there with plain English gossip , quotations , recipes , and news about the condition of crops , lake , and various forms of animals identified by name and species ( Grolier the Pig , Concord the Goose , etc. ) .  |p288Mrs  . Gamely had taken him aside and dictated it to him , makinghim promise to deliver it personally , because , as she said , " Coheeriesmail is heteronomic and ludibund . " The problem was that Virginia 's mail , whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her whereabouts were a mystery . But Mrs. Gamely had made Hardesty swear that he would seek her out before he left New York . Upon asking what he should do if he could not find her , Mrs. Gamely had replied , " Keep looking . " Now , because the bank in St. Louis had failed , Hardesty no longer had as much time as he had thought he would have . He wondered how he would find VirginiaGamely , and he half regretted that he had agreed to do so . But that is not to say that he was not pleased with the city , and with the prospect of searching through it . SOON it was dark , and people were gathering for dinner or hot drinks in restaurants and cafes with slanted glass awnings that were covered with snow . But Hardesty passed by these places and did not come in from the cold until he came to the library . This was the deepest place in the city , for its hundred million isles were further subdivided into countless patterns , chapters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely lines derived from a series of coordinates , which the eye pieced together and united in a riverlike flow , as if all the bent and convoluted little sticks were the lights of a cityscape that was beautiful from afar . In fact , when Hardesty walked among the books that lined the high walls of the main reading room , he felt as if he were walking into a city . The plain of tables and readers flanked on four sides by tall rectangular bookcases was a parodyof Central Park , especially since the reading lamps were as green as grass . While scholars were returning to their nocturnal labors after meager dinners of bile and gravel , Hardesty began his researches . He was in his natural element , he knew what to do , and he moved fast because the walk in the cold had made him alert . First he went through every conceivable directory , looking for Virginia Gamely 's name . He even went into the reception hall and called directory assistanceto see if she had an unpublished number . Evidently , shep289did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . Hardesty called the police , who could not help , they said , because they were too busy chasing criminals and sleeping in patrol cars under bridges . Besides , why was it their business ? Having overturned all the easy stones , he started on the boulders . Since Mrs. Gamely had n't the vaguest idea of where her daughterwas , Hardesty decided to accomplish in the library what he had been unable to do at Mrs. Gamely 's because she had been too busy to make associations . He would find out about Lake of the Coheeries , and , by discovering its characteristics , deduce enough about Virginia to help him track her down . First , the atlas . But Lake of the Coheerieswas not in the index , and , in the place where he knew that he had been , the map showed a strangely empty patch of green with occasional relief and a nameless river or two . The detailed maps , the official surveys , and the historical gazetteers were similarly uninformative . Wherever he turned , he came up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half hours of puzzlement , he quit for the night just as the library was about to close . If there was nothing about Lake of the Coheeries in this great repository , there was likely to be nothing anywhere . While he was putting on his coat in the marble reception hall , he asked the library clicker  --  a man so old that he looked inside-out  --  if he knew of a cheap place to stay . " I have limited funds , " Hardesty said , " and I 'm looking for someplace that 's simple , clean , and inexpensive . I do n't need a bathroom in my room . " " Who has a bathroom in the room ? " asked the old man , whose job was to press a clicker every time someone walked by . ( It had been a long tradition at the library and could not be abandoned , and he did n't know how to do anything else . ) " The bathroom 's another room . It ca n't be in the same room unless it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they do n't got that . " " That 's right , " said Hardesty . " Good thinking . What I meanis that I do n't need a private bathroom , connected to my room . " " How about sharing a room , sort of ? " asked the old man . " What do you mean , sort of ' ? " " What I mean is that the Widow Endicott takes in boarders. "  | " More than one to a room ? " " Not exactly , but it 's cheap . And it 's clean . You look like a strong young man . " " What has that got to do with it ? " " The Widow Endicott has got certain appetites . She makes certaindemands . Understand ? " " What 's she like ? " Hardesty asked . " What 's she like ? Oh Lordy ! What she is like ! If only she 'd been around when I was able . " " I might as well look at the place , " Hardesty said . " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well look at the place . You would n't want to disappoint a poor widow , would ya ? Very kind of you . It 's on Second Avenue , way downtown . I do n't know what street crosses it , but it 's near the old Coheeries Theater . " " The what theater ? " Hardesty shouted . " The Coheeries Theater . They do n't call it that anymore , but I remember when they used to have stage plays there . Now they use it for wrestling , dance shows , and vaudeville . " " What do you know about the theater ? " " In general ? " " The Coheeries Theater . " " Just what I told you . " " Do you know why it was called that ? " " Let me see . Why was it called . . . I du n no . I never thought about it . Maybe it 's a kind of clam or something , and when the curtain went up on the plays  --  Shakespeare -- it was like a clamshell opening . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the winter night to see what he could find out about the place from the place itself . The marquee of the Coheeries Theater had written upon it the words " Lucha Libre , " and all the stores for ten blocks around were boarded up , though diagonally across the avenue was the Widow Endicott 's boardinghouse , the very sight of which made Hardesty 's heart jump with fear and curiosity . Even if she turned out , in fact , to be a hag , the house itself was magnificent . Candles burned in thep291windows , the brass shone like gold , and the eaves and trim were kept up as if the place were a national monument . The theater had seen much better days . Forty people sat in the front rows , eating shish kabab or hot pretzels and awaiting the wreck of vaudeville , which had been resurrected for those too poor to have a television set . After picking his way over pools of sticky litter and through drifts of spilled popcorn , Hardesty took a seat in the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimmed and the curtain was raised . He could see that the once-elegant dome and walls were covered with murals and scrollwork . But it was too dark to make out details , and he contented himself with watching the show . For the lighting , though more than half a century old , cut out all the world except the velvety dream beyond the footlights . The darkness popped with remembered silver flashes , and the colored gels and beams were as fresh as the face of a young girl who has been out in the snow . First came two comedians . Their jokes were in Yiddish though their audience was in Spanish ; their toupees were of a material that resembled orange excelsior ; and they went through their routines with closed eyes . Then came a bicycle act during which a frightfully skinny Sicilianrode a bicycle around the stage for about five minutes . When the booing became too much for him to bear , he screwed up his features in pain and determination , and tried to stand on his head on the seat . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was in truth not very good at riding a bicycle . But when he tried to stand on his head , he lost control of his vehicle , and he and it flew over the apron into an empty row of seats . Next came a well-worn group called The Singing Cucumbers . How they had managed to stay out of the salad for three-quarters of a century was a mystery of considerable grandeur . In cucumber costumes , straw boaters , canes , spats , and pencil mustaches , they sang three songs  --  " The Mice Made a Break for Freedom , " " Beethoven 's Nephew , " and " The Boer War Triangle . " Despite their incapacities , these touching , persistent , thirdrate  --  seventh-rate  --  theatricalpeople strove to excel . They thought that they were artists : they said so on their tax forms and in busp292stations in northeastern Delaware , and they almost had it right , for they were not artists , but art . They were in themselves like sad songs , or revealing portraits . Something about them was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see very clearly beyond their driven ambitions . And they had never figured out that their every move made them part of a sad tableau . Last on the bill was a dancing act . Three odd young girls who called themselves The Spielers danced in wooden shoes and green homespun dresses . A card on a tripod identified them as Little Liza Jane , Dolly , and Bosca , the dark girl . They jumped and twirled in strange jigs , and seemed not to notice that they were onstage in a theater . They loved to dance . They danced with each other three at a time . They smiled . And in the end they gave three lovely and innocent bows . The lights came up before the wrestling , giving Hardesty a chance to study the murals . A dozen scenes from Lake of the Coheerieswere clearly depicted in shady old oils . Here was the lake in summer , spring , and fall , ice-covered in winter . Here was the village , under the stars , in the snow , or surrounded by somnolent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the lake . Here were village girls , farmers , and a horse pulling a sled . But in the dome of the theater was the most unusual picture of them all . It showed an island in the lake , at night . Rising from it was a whitened column of stars , as if the Milky Way had dipped down in imitation of a rainbow . What Hardesty next saw pushed him down in his seat and made him tremble . Engraved around the dome in letters that now were so dirty that they could hardly be seen , were the words , " For what can be imagined more beautiful than the sight of a perfectly just city rejoicing in justice alone ? " The wrestling was half over by the time Hardesty made his way out of the theater . Just before the exit was a plaque stating that the Coheeries Theater had been donated to the city by Isaac Penn . This was a lead , though undoubtedly blind , that he would have to follow . But he wanted to sleep , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The coincidence of inscriptions could not possibly have beenp293more than just that . Certainly the perfectly just city would never arise on these unclean ruins , not in the lap of an industrial civilizationknown primarily for civilization in the breach , not in a noisy inhumane city fashioned in gray after the image of a machine , nor from amid the soot-covered spires , the ice-choked riverways , and the endless avenues of careless war-torn architecture . No . Everything he knew told him that it could never be so . It was merely a coincidence , and would not keep him from traveling on . Still , he was dazed . And he was putty in the hands of the Widow Endicott . S H E was a red-haired beauty , an Amazon , almost as big as the marblestatue of Diana in the park at Winky 's Hill . Ten husbands had died in her bed , so she started a boardinghouse for young men just in from the country . These she shuffled around among several rooms that adjoined her own , and among the baths , showers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment 's notice to pop in and copulate . She was perfect and insatiable . Each breast was a marvel . Her forest of red pubic hair was soft , fragrant , and deep . She was as white as ivory but glossed in red because of her red hair and the rhythmic undercolor of her fine skin as the blood beat through it . She liked that Hardesty was trim and strong , and she put him close by . From the way that she looked at him , he suspected that he would be making love to her soon . He went to his room , undressed , and got into bed . When he was half asleep , protesting in a borderless meditation the notion that New York might be anything but a crowded tool chest on a slag heap of materialism , the connecting doors to the widow 's room flew open . He walked carefully through a small passageway into her bedchamber , which was entirely white . Even the floor was white , and there were no windows , only a skylight . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bars of an iron grate , pulsing like a Pittsburgh open hearth . The Widow Endicott was redolent in her white bed in the light of the seething coals . She was undulating as she lay back , her hips propped up on a big pillow . Hardesty saw beneath the white silky skin an outline of delicate ribs . She was an essay in red ; her deep auburn hair , her lips just slightly apart , thep294tips of her breasts as short , slight , and red as a scarlet brush stroke  --  and her red pubic hair gleaming like a Pacific forest . Though Hardestywished that he were a painter , so that he might paint her , paint her is not what he did . Hardesty 's useless struggles at the library the evening before were well compensated twenty-four hours later , after he had spent most of the day recovering . Though there was not a single reference to Lake of the Coheeries , and the word Coheeries itself probably did not exist in any of the books in the library , entries for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found himself in the Penn archives , surrounded not only by books but by pamphlets , broadsides , photographs , letters , and manuscripts . A large number of letters and telegrams had been sent via Hudson or by hand . The Penns , a family associated with newspapers , whaling , and the arts ( there was even a young collection on Jessica Penn  --  a Broadway actressof whom Hardesty had heard ) , maintained a summer house in a place that was never identified as anything but " L of C. " Enough material rested in the archives to absorb several scholars in long and productive careers , but Hardesty was drawn mainly to the photographs , of which there were thousands  --  all black and white  --  in the powerful , communicative style of the nineteenth century , when sensibilities born of painting contributed to photography what photography itself would soon help to obliterate . These pictures were chronologically arranged in brass-hinged albums of varnished cherrywood . Each turning of a page revealed a photograph with a key in which the subjects were identified and the setting was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the century solely by this record , one might have thought that it was a time devoted primarily to rowboats , toboggans , snow shoes , tennis racquets , oceangoing yachts , and outdoor furniture . The Penns loved to take pictures of themselves as they played sports , or sat in the summer sun looking over the sea . Although quite a few shots were of Isaac Penn at public functions or in the midst of his staff on The Sun , and some were of Beverly playing the piano , Jack doing an experiment with his chemistry set , or Jayga standing in an imperial pose , arms akimbo , in front of her stove , most were of the family together . They were gathered in the snow , picnicking in high mead/ows , racing horses , rowing in the August heat , or walking along the beach at the end of day  --  sunburnt , healthy , listening to the slowly unfurling waves . As the history of the Penns unfolded for Hardesty , welling up from the past with surprising vitality , he noticed two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes that were to be expected : after all , from his perspective in the future , Hardesty was not surprised that the infant Harry quickly grew until ( in two hours ) he was in command of a regiment ; or by the staccato freezing and unfreezing of the lake ; or when ( from one wooden album to another ) lovely little Willa became lean and , yet , voluptuous , in a way that reached out to Hardesty across a good part of the century . From his godlike perspective , he was able to gloss over minor inconsistenciesand not worry about people who appeared and disappeared , or changes in posture , decor , and fashion . He was , after all , floating in a lake of a hundred eventful years . But the archivists had done such a good job that when they faltered Hardesty wondered why . The inconsistencies which stayed with him were that Beverly seemed always to be in a stronger light than anyone else ( some of the pictures betrayed an aura that not even the chroniclers had noticed  --  much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared for a short time in one of the cold and snowy years immediately preceding the Great War , and remained unidentified . He looked neither like the Penns , nor like a servant , nor like a member of the upper classes . He had a rough , solid , workingman 's manner , and one could tell even from a photograph that he spoke English the way the Irish did , that he was strong , and that he was good with tools . His burly hands were not made for a pen or a piano . He might have been the foreman of The Sun 's mechanics , the keeper of their farms in Amagansett , or the captain of one of Isaac Penn 's merchantmen  --  buthe was n't , because he was often dressed like a dandy , he always stood near Beverly , and , in one picture , he had put his arms around her with a tenderness that caused Hardesty to stare transfixed at the photograph for fifteen minutes . Hardesty felt that this man 's affection , like Willa 's coming into womanhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was far more than affection that moved him . It was love . And then Hardesty discovered the strangest seriesp296of images . A somber wedding , with Beverly  --  hardly able to stand  --  supported on the man 's arm . A long string of photographs of an island in the lake , bare and trembling in winter , almost indistinguishable from the snow-covered ice . In none of the photographs was the stranger identified . Underneathhis silhouette in the key to each picture in which he appeared was simply a question mark . Who was he ? The meticulous archivists did not know , and apologized for not being able to explain him . A note attached to the last binder said that the living members of the Penn family had refused to comment on their photographic history , or , for that matter , even to review the collection . Hardesty studied the interloper 's face . He liked it . He liked it very much , and he was moved by the half-unnamed couple who simplydisappeared , and who , apparently , would be forgotten for all time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more or less . Here and there , perched on a haystack or ensconced in the upper scroll of a horse-drawn sled , were Gamelys  --  healthy yeomen , children , local people of the lake , who obviously knew the Penns and spent time with them . Though the Penns seemed to have left Lake of the Coheeries , distintegrated , and been frozen in place within their own dynasticarchives , Hardesty decided to seek them out , in the hope that Virginia Gamely had done so , too . AS great as the city was in nearly all respects , it had one unaccountableand unforgivable failing . For the many many millions of people , there were only two major newspapers . True , one could buy ten or twelve pages of day-old news in any language of the world and in any alphabet , and hundreds of stations crowded the electronic spectrum , like the bands of a coral snake , but the population as a whole was regretfully polarized : one followed either The Sun or The Ghost . There was a Morning Ghost , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghost , Morning Edition ; and The New York Ghost , Evening Edition ) , and there were The New York Morning Whale , and The New York Evening Sun . Their rivalry straddled both editions , dusk and dawn . Anyone native to the city knew this apposition asp297readily as night and day , light and dark , or fat and thin . But Hardestydid not . So when he came to a newsstand on an empty street corner , a lighthouse amid a sea of swirling blue snow , he was surprised to discover that The Sun was indeed still in the hands of the Penn family , and that Harry Penn  --  infant turned regimental commander  --  wasits editor and publisher . He went down to Printing House Square at ten o'clock , assuming that at that hour a newspaper would be in the middle of a sprint for the deadline . In fact , it was sprinting so hard that no one noticed Hardesty or would answer any of his questions . For two hours , he stayed in the middle of The Sun 's glassed-in courtyard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above as hundreds of reporters , copy boys , messengers , worried editors , and inky printers crisscrossed around him heading from one door to another or up and down the open stairs that led to each of the floors looking over the enclosed court . But then , at midnight , everything stopped except the presses  --  which began to rumble on the bottom floors , like the engines of a ship , as if they were not merely stamping out impressions , but moving the building ahead in a turbulent and foggy sea . Hardesty went to the city room , on the third floor , where he stopped the first person he met . This was , in fact , Praeger de Pinto , the managing editor . " Excuse me , " Hardesty said . " I 'm trying to find someone who came originally from the Lake of the Coheeries , where the Penns once had a summer house . It may have been foolish for me to have come here , but I have no other connections and no other way to locate her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she is , or for suggestions about how to find her . " " Are you looking for Virginia Gamely ? " Praeger asked . " That 's exactly who I 'm looking for . " " She works here . " " Then I 've found her . " " But she 's not here now . We just put The Whale to bed , and she 's on The Sun . She comes in at six in the morning . " " My name is Hardesty Marratta . I was on the Polaris . . . . I have a letter from her mother . " " I can give it to her . "  | " Her mother made me promise to do it myself . " Praeger introduced himself and invited Hardesty into his office on the floor above ( to which they ascended via a cast-iron spiral staircasethat pierced the ceiling ) to talk about what Hardesty had seen in Lake of the Coheeries . Praeger had been interested in the place from the time that Virginia had first brought it up and then conspiredwith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was interested in Hardesty 's descriptions , both for their content and because he recognized that , like Virginia , Hardesty had a gift for language . " I do n't know what it is about Lake of the Coheeries , " Praeger said , " or even if Lake of the Coheeries does , in fact , exist . But everyone who passes through it seems to acquire a way with words that I like very much . Maybe we 'll have some seminars up there ( if we can get to it ) , or bottle the water for our coolers . " They spoke for several hours , touching upon a dozen or more subjects and discovering that their views were remarkably similar . They were weary and relaxed ; they both loved the strain of winter ; they enjoyed one another 's sharp conversation ; and they got along extremely well , except for one thing . They disagreed about the nature of the city itself . Hardesty was in no mood for toleration of its numerous and outstanding urban deformities , and would not forgive what he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigid way that it was laid out , architected , built , fixed , and maintained . He hated it as if he were about to love it  --  unforgivingly , irrationally , sadly . Though they were beautiful and magnetic , the deep-throated whistles that shot through the snow and rattled the windows of The Sun made him uneasy , and the thought of the endless internal horizonsincorporated into the streets , bends , alleys , and roosts made him extremely uncomfortable . Praeger had seen this before . " You 'll soon be forever in love with the things you now despise , " he said . " That 's what you think , " returned Hardesty . " I 'm on my way to Europe . I 'm not going to be here long enough to fall in love with anything at all . " " The anarchy will hold you . " " How could it ? It 's what I detest the most . "  | " You know that it is n't anarchy at all , and that , even if it is , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , as well , that the very fact the city survives and remains on its feet implies an equilibrium , which , in turn , implies the presence of a high and opposingforce for each category of degradation . " " I do n't see them . Do you ? " " Only rarely . But when I do , I can see that the balances are maintained . I can see traces of a perfect age , in the way that veins of the roughest ore can lead to gold . " " And what if the ugliness and the horror wear you down untilyou are unable to appreciate what you hope for , should it arrive . " So much the better . I love the risk . I like it that  --  try as I might  --  the outcome is hardly up to me . The plans for the city were drawn on the same table as the plans for war . It promises nothing , and yet it can be inimitably generous . You should stay awhile and get some idea of how it works . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , summer and winter , they become a song , a message . I always think that they 're saying , Your time is a good time , and though I have to leave , you can stay . How lucky you are to be in the city just before it opens its eyes upon a golden age . ' " They parted uneasily , because Hardesty resented that Praeger had predicted a change in him , and Praeger resented having had to do it . What did Praeger care , anyway , about what Hardesty thought ? But he promised to introduce Hardesty to Virginia the next day at four , just after The Sun was put to bed . Hardesty walked five miles through a driving snowstorm to the Hotel Lenore , a tall tower in midtown that caught the snow against its high glass sides and sent it falling in bushels like whitewater dashing through a flume . The streets had been as empty as the prairie , and while they were white it had seemed as if the possibilities of which Praeger had spoken were indeed present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wars of equilibrium were waged . The night manager gave Hardesty the highest room in the hotel . Because he had found Virginia , and could leave New York in a day or two , Hardesty felt that he could afford the astronomical price . He had left The Sun at one in the morning . Now it was so far in thep300middle of the night that the clocks had quit , and time seemed to have been obliterated by the raging storm . When he arrived in his room on the 120th floor , he went to the window and peered into the skein of wind-snarled white ebbing and flowing against the glass . This was a frustrating , hard , unforgiving , unkind city , strong on suffering , punishment , and murderous weather . Its climate and population were a scythe that swept relentlesslyuntil even the strong fell before it , and the weak in their great numbers vanished from the streets forever and died unremembered in the cold and dark . Standing on the 120th floor , he could see nothing  --  and he took that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hardesty was cheered when he discovered that there was a sauna in the bathroom . Soon after he stepped in and closed the cedar door , the heat began to come up and a bank of sunlights blazed . After trudging across the arctic boweries , he was delighted to find himself in a dry desert , but he was so cold that it took him forty-five minutes to work up a sweat . The next day , he would deliver the letter to Virginia Gamely , and , if he were lucky , board a liner that would charge the ice and break from the harbor . Then its whistle blasts would be in his favor , not against him . But they seemed not to be against Praeger , certainly , who thought they were like an organ in a church , commandingattention , calling forth those emotions that shook the body like a reed . Hardesty heard the deep whistles even in the desert on the 120th floor , at three , or four , or five , or whatever o'clock it was in the morning . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrieking now ? Can ships be leaving at this time , in the teeth of the storm ? And who hears them ? Ceaseless activity , even when everyone was presumed to be asleep , suggested to him that the city did have a life of its own , and that there was indeed something underneath , slowly and methodicallyworking its way out . Nearly faint , he emerged from the sauna and went to the window . The storm was still raging , but , staring into it , he became aware of a glow . Straight on , it , too , must have been high in the air , and it appeared to grow stronger as the wind went mad and rocked the steel cliff in which he stood.  |p301Then  , as if the snow were fog and the hotel were a ship , a space opened up as if to accommodate motion , and a lighted tower came into view suspended in the maelstrom and seemingly independent of the ground . It was the top of an old skyscraper  --  floodlighted in blue , white , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a transparentcurtain , it always managed to shine through , as bright as a halo . Toward morning , when dawn made the blizzard gray and the world was clouded over , the tower was lost . T H E morning was as clear as glass . Hardesty went to the window and surveyed a forest of high towers slicing up the wind that came down from Canada herding the color blue before it like a vast number of sheep . On distant bridges , golden streams of glinting mica  --  cars in the morning sun  --  moved to and from the city . And the sisters of the ships he had heard in the storm , ships as big as cities used to be , placidly crossed the wave-etched harbor , sliding over high whitecaps like a hot iron on linen . In the streets , people were jumping like puppets , racing around at a speed that astonished even them . On those clear icy days when the full moon could not even wait for the dark , and circled the sun in the sky , they danced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paddock , they acted like people who have discovered somethinggreat , and , in justifying the saying that New York is a city which dies and rises the way other cities go to bed at night and get up in the morning , they made the long lean island of Manhattan ring and tremble like an unsheathed sword . Hardesty took nearly the whole day to push through these lunaticson his way to Printing House Square . They would give neither him nor anyone else an inch . Lines of traffic bolted through red lights . Bakery trucks raced on the main avenues at 125 miles per hour , assassinating bicyclists and pedestrians . Balkan pretzel vendors in two-foot-thick padded clothing and fleecy aviator caps charged each other with their flame-holding wagons , bumping like buffalos , to lay claim to a corner . With attache cases strapped to their backs , stockbrokersin three-piece suits raced in life or death agony on crosscountryskis from Riverside Drive to Wall Street . On one bustlingp302avenue , the second story of each commercial building on both sides of the street for five miles was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these during the lunch hour , and heard several hundred thousand combative screams , as figures in white sailed through the air , legs cocked and arms outstretched , like Russian dancers . There were fires blazing on every corner , mortal arguments on each block , robberies in commission , buildings attacked by squads of devilish wreckers , and buildings assembled by construction workers who rode single cables until they disappeared into the sky . Hardesty found it difficult to get downtown and stay the same . The city wanted fuel for its fires , and it reached out with leaping tongues of gravity and flame to pull people in , size them up , dance with them a little , sell them a suit  --  and then devour them . It was late and dark by the time he reached Printing House Square , where The Sun 's offices faced those of The Ghost across the way . The Ghost had large electric signs on its huge headquarters , proclaiming its success and popularity , whereas The Sun glowed gently from inside a masterpiece of neoclassical architecture . Hardesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His rapidly beatingheart was whipped on even faster when he found Praeger de Pinto and Virginia sitting together on Praeger 's leather couch , closely and easily enough to suggest that they were perhaps more than just comfortable with one another . Intense jealousy struck him like a missile . The agony was physical . Damn this city , where there was no justice and never would be . He knew upon seeing Virginia 's eyes that this was the woman for him , and he cursed the timing of it , since he could see that she and Praeger . . . . But then he thought that maybe he was just imagining it , for when Praeger stood to greet him it appeared as if the distance between Praeger and Virginia on the couch had been at least a foot . A foot and a half , he thought , full of hope , perhaps even two feet . Hardesty decided that this lovely unselfconsciouswoman with long black hair and supremely intelligent eyes , would soon be his wife  --  Praeger or no Praeger . " I 'll crush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud , without knowing it . " Who ? " asked Praeger . Virginia was curious as well , and alreadysmitten . " Craig Binky , " Hardesty blurted out , fast on his feet.  | " Oh , " said Praeger . " We all would like to do that . But what brought you into the fold so soon ? " " I saw today 's Ghost . Infuriating . " Virginia smiled . From the way Hardesty had looked at her , the slight shake in his voice , and his unhappiness , she knew that he had fallen in love . This showed a certain weakness of character , yes , but it was a commitment she could not ignore . Though she tried to hang on to the steep slopes down which she felt herself sliding , after just a few minutes she gave up entirely . Still , she did not want to be rash  --  she had a child to consider , because she had been rash once before . Praeger de Pinto , who had always been and would ever be in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversationand the not-quite-regular breathing , and watched Hardesty and Virginia discover one another while the shifts changed on the two papers and Printing House Square filled with crowds of pressmen , copy boys , and clerical workers treading down the snow . Before Hardesty delivered Mrs. Gamely 's letter , he spoke of the Polaris and of how , by accident , he had come to Lake of the Coheeries . As he spoke , he could feel Virginia 's love for the landscape he was describing . He was glad that it was winter , when love and ambitionflare in the cold . Perhaps if she had not been framed by the dark glass behind her and the snowy square dazzling with the lights of The Ghost , he would not have been able to talk to her in a way that almost trumpeted his intentions  --  that is , to everyone except Virginia , who valued them so much that she could not be sure of the obvious . After a while , they looked up and discovered that Praeger was gone . " How long do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked with a smile . " I do n't know , " Hardesty replied . " But let 's have dinner . " " I have to feed the baby , " she said . " Mrs. Solemnis likes to leave by six . " Hardesty 's confidence left him a lot faster than it had come . Again , he felt physical pain . Then she looked at him and said , " I 'm not married . "  |p304They  did n't find Praeger , but as they left the building , those of her colleagues who passed Virginia saw from Hardesty 's look of unsteadytriumph , and from her devilish , luminous blushing , that they had cause to give her quick knowing smiles  --  which only made her avert her eyes in delight . Hardesty had laid aside his sheepskin jacket in favor of a charcoal-graywoolen greatcoat for which he had traded a good portion of his reserves . He commented on this , and on how much warmer the sheepskin jacket had been , even if it had n't been as long . " Oh no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't want you to walk around in a shearling jacket . Not in the city , anyway . Wearing wilderness clothes here is as foolish as wearing city clothes in the wilderness . " They walked into the ferocious north wind , letting it sweep over their faces as if they were bathing in a river . He did n't dare take her arm when they crossed congested avenues , though he very much wanted to . She said she liked his coat , and she was bringing him home for dinner . At the moment , that was enough for him . The Chinese and Italian markets lay together back to back . Hardesty and Virginia went through the many acres of stalls , row after row , as if they were walking alone in the spring . The fruits and vegetables stacked in the cold reminded them of a garden , and the dead fish with mouths open in shock had the expressions of leaping trout . " I torment The Ghost sometimes , " Virginia said , " by following them in their pieces and doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer they did an article on the Chinese and Italian markets , and , as usual , all they talked about was the food . As far as The Ghost is concerned , if you ca n't put it in your mouth , it 's incomprehensible . " " I know , " said Hardesty . " I was rather amazed to see that page one of today 's Ghost had a two-column headline about a new way to braise artichokes . " " Of course . They do that all the time on page one  --  black bordersif someone 's souffle falls , banner headlines about a new kind of sauce . . . . I wrote an essay three days later , and I did n't mention food once . And yet , I think it was a better description of the market than they had , because the least of the market is the food . " " What is it then ? " Hardesty asked , though he already knew . " Buying and selling , faces , the color , the light , the stories thatp305breed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find all these clear lights strung so high and gleaming in the cold ? " she asked , indicating the chains of electric bulbs over the stalls . " Harry Penn got a telegram from Craig Binky , that said , How can you cover the marketand not mention food ? ' Imagine , they send telegrams between two offices on the same square . Harry Penn cabled back , Eating assassinates the spirit . ' " I like to eat , " she said . " In fact , I 'm hungry right now . But a rack of lamb is not the Roman Empire . " They bought a cut of steak and half a dozen kinds of vegetables , and they walked back through the acres of pearly lights , watching their breath condense in white clouds before them . " My house is that way , " Virginia said , " but I do n't want to go through the Five Points ; it 's too dangerous . So let 's walk up to Houston , and circle back . " " That 'll take three times as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the Five Points ? I went in there today and nothing happened . " " You were lucky . Besides , it 's dark . " " Do n't worry , " said Hardesty . " Thieves sleep in early evening . " The Five Points had seen bandits of many races and ethnicities roost on its roosts and snake about in its alleys . Fashions in crime and demeanor had changed with the times , the languages , and the temptations . But , essentially , the thieves and brigands were the same , and their weapons were the knife , the club , and the gun . Hardesty was right , though . They rested in early evening , for they were alive only after a few hours of darkness . The streets were empty and winter had left its charm at the boundaries of the Five Points  --  which was like a cave without an exit . Hardesty and Virginia had the sense that they were being observed from darkened windows . The only thing they heard was the ringing of a faraway bell , and hideous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that its pure sound was here powerless and corruptible . Halfway through , they began to see what they had been unable to see before . In the shadows were confused forms , bodies in pain , outstretched hands begging for mercy or release . With every step , the eyes that glowed at them grew more numerous , and the cries sharper.  | " I ca n't explain it , " said Hardesty , " but the empty streets are full . " He took Virginia 's arm and they walked toward a fire that burned at the edge of the district . At a fire there would be firemen and police , perhaps even the press . And the firelight would brighten their way until they broke out of the Five Points . A row of tenements was engulfed in orange . Billows of black smoke reflected the light downward and damped the sparks . All around , for as far as the eye could see , rejoicing crowds with firelight in their eyes took pleasure . A roar went up as children fell back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressed from roof to roof of the burning buildings . The fighters were so taken up in their combat that they ignored the fire which silhouetted them like cast-iron figures on a lantern stage and swallowed them up one by one as they dropped in defeat . Virginia was shaken , and Hardesty was sorry that he had insisted on going through the Five Points . " I did n't know , " he said , still numb from watching the children perish , though they had fallen back without a sound and had disappeared quite neatly . " It 's completelydifferent by day . I just did n't know . " Men and women came running in from the streets , like lizards darting to catch some sun . The sidewalks were soon overflowing , and foodstands began to appear . With no fire department , no ambulances , no trucks , no spotlights to leach away the shuddering orange light , the fire blazed , the tenements crumbled , and the people died . Through the middle of the crowd came a mutilated and disfigureddraft horse pulling a wagon loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to go around . But horse and wagon were soon engulfed , and moved in stops and starts . " Look at that animal , " Hardesty said , not knowing whether to feel compassion or disgust . " He 's the biggest dray horse I 've ever seen , and he 's as slim as a thoroughbred . Imagine what he must have been through . " As a gang of children beat him about the face with switches and his master beat him from behind with a heavy whip , the horse held his head down and closed his bruised eyes . Scars cut across his flanks and withers . Old craters in his hide were overlaid with the more recent burns and sores he suffered from a primitive and rudely lash/ioned harness ; his tail and mane were clipped to a stubble ; he had only one ear left intact  --  the other had had several pieces taken from itThe wagon was heavy . And yet the horse , who was so badly cut up that he looked like a man who has been tortured by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was strong , and despite his enormous size , he was graceful . When the muscles moved in the difficult pace he had to hold between his master'sdesires and the torment inflicted by the children , they showed themselves to be as solid and lean as those of a carefully bred racehorse , but many times as massive . When his horse and wagon cleared the crowd , the driver cracked the whip against the animal 's head and made him canter in harness . This he did with surprising grace , straining against the wood and leather that cut his flesh and rubbed against his sores , as if he were free and in an open field . The curves that he described were unaffectedby the load . They were perfectly elated , full , and round . He lifted his head and pushed into the darkness as if motion itself were one of the dimensions of paradise . WI N T E R , then in its early and clear stages , was a purifying engine that ran unhindered over city and country , alerting the stars to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare upreaching trees . It was a mad and beautiful thing that scoured raw the souls of animals and man , driving them before it until they loved to run . And what it did to northern forests can hardly be described , considering that it iced the branches of the sycamores on Chrystie Street and swept them back and forth until they rang like ranks of bells . It was ferociously cold by the time Hardesty and Virginia arrived at the apartment house on Mulberry Street and climbed the dimly lighted winding stairs , their faces red with the stinging remembrance of a wind which had whipped at them and blown Virginia'sscarf straight back . Now they were in the heated hallway , following the stairs , rising through the building in epicycles more appropriate to the planets . The ever-suspicious eye of Mrs. Solemnis ,  |p308a  Greek sponge fisherman 's widow , appeared in the door periscope and bounded back and forth like a radar blip . " Who is it ? " she asked . " It 's me , " answered Virginia . " Who is me ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia Gamely . For goodness ' sake , Mrs. Solemnis , I live here . I employ you . " " Oh , you . " Mrs. Solemnis opened the door and thrust Martin into Hardesty 's arms , saying , " You take . " Although he had not been on earth for much longer than a year , Martin was perfect , from his tiny curled fists to the long blue flannel tail ( a Coheeries baby gown constructed to accommodate him as he grew ) that made him look like a small , breastless mermaid . He carefullyrested a cheek against the cold cloth of Hardesty 's coat and closed his eyes in complete trust . Hardesty felt the slight weight in his arms , the baby 's breathing , and an occasional twitch of an arm or leg . He looked down at Martin 's soft sleepy face , and kissed him . " Yes , " he said , bouncing him gently , " sweet baby . " Hardesty left his coat on so as not to disturb Martin , and watched Virginia move about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Mrs. Solemnis was not . She glided through the several rooms , knocking things into place and aligning them symmetrically . In her charcoal-gray suit and ruffled shirt , she looked like a portrait from another century , the kind in which the subject stares from halflighton into time . But despite the dignity of this portrait Hardesty could not restrain his laughter , because as she walked to and fro she would stop and turn to check on him and the baby , or to smile in embarrassment for being so neat , and when she did she seemed like the mechanical bears in shooting galleries , who pause and swivel so they can be shot . The effect was exaggerated when , explaining that she wanted to change , she backed into the bedroom in little mechanicalsteps , closing the door after her . Wondering if it had been wise to allow him inside ( she had visions of a crazed lunatic tossing Martin great distances , probably because , in his Coheeries gown , Martin was shaped like a football ) , she peeped out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a shooting gallery ? " Hardesty asked . " No , " she answered , reappearing in her charcoal suit because she had forgotten to change . " I 'm practicing for an interview with Craig Binky . He has a notoriously short attention span . When you talk to him you have to make threatening motions and bizarre gestures . Otherwise , he does n't understand . " " Who told you that ? " " Harry Penn . He knows that Binky ca n't resist any kind of flattery , so every once in a while he sends a reporter over to find out the secrets of The Ghost . Tomorrow it 's my turn . That 's how we know everything that goes on there and exactly what they intend to do in the future . But we are a mystery to them . Though we care little about secrecy , The Sun and The Whale are like the two halves of a clam . Nothing leaks , because everyone knows his job and has a share in the enterprise . As far as I know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' page . Last week , we ran the recipe for my mother'ssaxophone pie , and The Ghost had it the same day . In all the world there 's only one saxophone pie ( it 's made with peaches , resin , blueberries , rum , and mint ) , and I doubt that The Ghost spies  --  who tiptoe around our building in false beards and mustaches  --  were able to steal it from the composing rooms . " She took the baby . Hardesty threw his coat across a chair and stood near her in a way that made them look like a creche in a town square . He , too , was dressed in a suit that might have been from a nineteenth-century portrait  --  it was a little too big for him , and it made him feel as if he had just stepped from a carriage . " Are you irrevocably divorced from his father ? " " Yes , " she answered , with neither bitterness nor regret . " Do you ever want to go back to Lake of the Coheeries ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . " " Soon ? " " When these winters end . Perhaps during the millennium . I think that , with the millennium , much will have changed ; if not in the world , then in me . I hope to have seen something far better than anything I have ever seen before . " Hardesty did with his emotions what one does with one 's body in sitting bolt upright . " What do you mean ? " he asked  |p310She  dodged the question , for her only answer was one of faith and intuition , and she wanted neither to burden him nor to turn him away , though she did want to tell him , and she did want to embrace him , and to be embraced . Hardesty went to the window . Over courtyards and courtyards , a mile-long corridor of terra-cotta-colored buildings , vaulted stone windows , slate roofs , and trees that in summer were green billows rising from the private gardens of the poor , were the two battleshipgraytowers of the Williamsburg Bridge , alive in lights like blue diamonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , rocking the baby , " was built later than nineteen-fifteen . It 's as quiet as a meadow . In summer , the trees hold hundreds of birds that sing in the morning . Someone has a poultry roost , and when the sun comes up and floods the yards like the tide of Fundy , the cock crows . It always sounds to me as if he 's saying Nineteen-hundred ! Nineteen-hundred ! Nineteen-hundred ! ' " " Do you think that in a few years he 'll be saying Two thousand ! Two thousand ! Two thousand ! ' ? " " I think , Mr. Marratta , " she answered , almost gravely , " that in a few years not only the cock will be crowing two thousand . Everyonewill . " " Because it 's an even number ? " he asked , narrowing in on her . " No , " she said , nearly shaking , because she wanted him to narrowin , and she was afraid . " Not because it 's an even number . " " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because these extraordinary winters will end . " " And the city will change ? " " Yes , the city will change . " " And what if it does n't ? " " It will . " " Why ? " " If nothing happens whatsoever , still , the relief will change everything , as will the difficult schooling in expectations . It will change . That much I know . " " How do you know ? " Hardesty asked  | " You 'll think I 'm crazy , " she replied , turning her head away as if she were hurt . " No , I wo n't think you 're crazy . " " I know , " she said , " because these winters have not been for nothing . They are the plough . The wind and the stars are harrowing the land and battering the city . I feel it and can see it in everything . The animals know it is coming . The ships in the harbor rush about and have come alive because it is coming . I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act has significance , and that , in our time , all the ceaseless thunder is not for nothing . " " I believe it too , " Hardesty said , taking her hands . And thus , as fast as a whiplash , a marriage was made one evening in winter , in a city sure to rise.  |p312THERE  was a lot of light on the sea , and a good-tempered wind rounded the headland in strength , pushing beforeit a trim outer-banks sloop with mainsail running full and a spinnaker swelling ahead . To the west was a long empty coast of fragrant green vegetation . The water flowed in currents and streams within the brine where cool rivers had broken clean of a bar and erupted into the ocean like a plume of expiring fireworks . The riggingcreaked in protest , because the boat had not been made to fly at twenty-five knots . The sea was crowded with fish , and the beaches were whiter than a cut in new glass . Although they had not spoken since they had abandoned that day 's fishing and set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother Holman knew of one another 's concern with the sunnyp313but insistent gale . It got stronger by degrees , never slackening , until it seemed powerful enough to blow the sea off the earth and into empty space . " Can we tack against this wind , Asbury ? " Holman shouted . Asbury shook his head . " Nothing could tack against this wind , " he shouted back . " I 've never seen anything like it . This is the kind of gale that sinks fleets of warships . If we try to come about , we 'll bust up for sure . Still , we 're lucky . " " Why ? " " Because a wind like this should make sea state ten , but the sea is as flat as ice . That 's because the wind is so steady . If it was n't , it would make waves a hundred and fifty feet high . And we have n't got much of a transom , " he said , looking at the water a foot below the top of the tiller post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spinnaker , " Holman asked . " No , " ordered Asbury . " I 'll do it . It 's too dangerous for you to move .. . . " But before he could finish his sentence , young Holman , only twenty-one and rather slight , began to crawl toward the bow . Asbury called for him to come back , but he would n't , and he inched forward , resisting the force of the wind like a man who is trying to hold his place in a rapids . " Just cut it loose , " Asbury shouted . But though the words were snatched away and propelled forward , Holman had no chance of hearing . With one foot braced on the cowling in front of the mainmast , and the other pressed against a winch , he began to undo the spinnakerline . " Cut it ! " his brother yelled to no avail . " Cut it ! " When the line started smoking through the cleet , Holman realized that he was sitting on top of the coil . He raised himself a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he pitched forward into the sea . Asbury threw a life ring to starboard and began playing out the rope . After all one hundred feet of it had shot through his hands and I Tolman still had n't surfaced , he let go of the end , hoping to leave Holman something to hold onto . But then Asbury was stunned to see that Holman was still with him , half in and half out of the water on the starboard side , hangingp314on to the spinnaker line . He was repeatedly dashed against the sea . Sometimes he was lifted fifty or sixty feet into the air and thrown back against the water when the sail whipped down . Intending to free the spinnaker and haul his brother in on it , Asbury rushed forward . But the wind blew him off his feet and knocked him against the mainmast . With his vision darkened and half his strength gone , Asbury still managed to unfold his clasp knife . He cut the spinnaker halyard . But instead of lowering the pulley the way it normally would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While he was trying to decide what to do , Asbury looked at the end of the sail and saw that Holman had let go . Then the spinnaker flew into the air and collapsed onto the surface of the water . He peered through the blood that was thickening in his eyes , but had he been able to see he would not have seen Holman , who disappeared under the water . He determined to come about , even if it killed him . Slipping on his own blood , Asbury went to the helm . When he reached the tiller , he slumped against it and held on . His hand stuck to it because of the blood that was over everything . " Where 's it coming from ? " he asked out loud , because there was blood in the wind , in hot droplets that , at first , he thought were rain . But it was his blood , spurting from an artery in his scalp . He tried to stop it with his hand , and it sprayed through his fingers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mast , he leaned against the tiller hard and pushed it over . But the only thing that happened was that the stern rode up in the water and bumped along like a popper lure . Because there was nothing else to do , Asbury held the tiller over until his strength left him and he fell onto the floorboards . He tried to get up , and could n't . He pressed the wound against a rib in the hull , hoping to stanch the bleeding . The last thing he remembered was the sound of the wind . When he awoke he was desperately cold . Though he was not far north , and it was June , it was night on the sea and he had been badly injured . He thought that his neck would be forever paralyzed in the crooked position into which it had frozen against the rib in the hull , and he could n't open his eyes . Like someone who stays awake all night in the cold rather than get up to find an extra blanket , he remained in that uncomfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , until he was alert enough to understand that the smooth and varying motions of the boat signified temperate sleigh rides down shallow swells . The sound of relentless wind had vanished , leaving in its place the familiar gurgling of brine mixing itself up in the centerboard well , and the noises of rigging that ached like trees in the fall . To get free , he threw himself over on his side . Though he felt an overwhelming pain in his head , and though his ribs collided with the anchor , he found that moving had done him a great deal of good . He moved as much as he could . After freeing his lashes of caked blood , he opened his eyes . As the circulation was restored and he grew warmer and less stiff , he looked at the stars and realized that it was early morning , probably about four o'clock . Assuming that he had not slept through an entire cycle of nights and days , he calculated that Holman had been in the sea at least sixteen hours , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rogue wind such as that which had overpowered them , Asbury could not hope to get back to the approximate location where his brother had gone overboard , in less than three or four days . Since they had been coasting , they had had no navigational instrumentsother than a compass . Asbury could not know where he was except by the crudest dead reckoning , and instinct , which told him to steer west-northwest for the nearest land . He put on a sweatshirtand Holman 's leather jacket . He was still cold , but he knew that the sun would be coming up soon . And he finished off a roast beef sandwich and an apple that had been left from lunch the day before . In preparation for a long hard sail , he ate the core of the apple , and he considered and rejected the stem , thinking that , if it were to come to eating wood , there was plenty in the boat . As miserable as he was for losing his brother , a steady course under the stars worked its magic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come far more slowly , but it came fast enough , and traveling straight over a glistening sea in which he could see a raft of stars revived him . Gliding through the oil-black sea under stars so still and dignifiedthat they might have been decorations for the dome of a cathedral , Asbury began to realize where he was headed , and why . It wasp316something that he could understand only with the gifts that come of early morning  --  one of those things , like a dream , that one can not always piece together again to remember and feel in sunlight and day . And yet enough early risings and enough work of heart and memory will bring it , half alive , from unfamiliar depths , like a slowly panting fish , hauled on deck , with fading eyes that beg for the sea . No one knew how old Asbury Gunwillow 's grandfather was , but he claimed to be well over 175 . " I 've got ta be , " he would say . " I 've got ta be a hundred and seventy-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began , I had just bought out my partner in a drygoodsstore in St. Albans , Vermont . During the war , I moved all my stock to New York and set up next to the Brooklyn Navy Yard . We supplied the yards when they built the ironclads . By the time Lincoln was shot , our warehouse covered a whole city block . " Then he would look to the ceiling , his gray eyes and delicate white hair would catch the light coming into the room , and his expression would turn to disbelief and confusion . " How could I be that old ? " he would ask . " No one lives to be that old . And besides , I 'm not clear on how the time went . But I remember , for example , where we lived during the war . " " Which war ? " Asbury asked . " I do n't remember . Our house was in the middle of the city , on a hill that gave us views of the Atlantic , the Hudson Highlands , the Ramapos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything from that house . I could see thousands of children playing in hundreds of parks . I could see them on the swings and slides . I could see the buttons on their coats . I saw the barges and ships on the river , and I knew where they were going , what they were carrying , and when they would arrive . I could see into every office , house , and cellar of the city , and not even a newly picked daffodil in a bottle of water on a windowsill could hide from me . I looked into every garden , over the shoulders of singing housewives , and into the committee rooms , the hospitals , and the theaters . I knew exactly what was happening at the Stock Exchange and what was going on in all the Staten Island steambaths . How could that be ? " he asked , doubting himself . " I do n't know.  |p317But  it 's true . It was like being up in a balloon on a clear summer 's day , watching everything . " On either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were boxwood mazes with one-way gates . Each had miles of passages , and the leaves were so dense that you could n't fire a bullet through them . One balcony that looked north was suspended by cables . It had an airy feeling to it , and we used to sit there after dinner and drink tea . The dog slept in the corner , in his own special dog nest under a green awning . It was very cool there in summer , that 's why . Give a dog a cool place in summer and a warm place in winter , and he 'll sleep for the rest of his life . The balcony faced north . Every evening , in the north light , the rivers were strikingly blue . . . . Are you my son ? " " No , Grandpa . I 'm your grandson . " " Which one are you ? " " I 'm Asbury . " " Where were we talking about ? " " About New York . " The old man stared vacantly ahead . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You ought to go there . " " Why ? " " Catch it before it gets too late  --  the engines . " " What engines ? " " All of ' em . They 're all set up to play one sound . They 're tuning , I think . It is n't right yet , but it 's music . One will lead . The others will follow  --  and that 'll be the day . " " I 'm sorry , Grandpa , " Asbury said , " but I do n't understand exactly what you mean . " " What are we talking about ? " " The engines . " " Oh , the engines . What do you want to know about them ? " " You said that they 're all set to play one sound . " " I did . They sit there as quietly as dogs , facing in all directions , some abandoned in the dark , some rusting and aging , others well tended . It does n't matter . They have souls . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They move , do n't they ? Who do you think sets things to moving ? Nothing that moves lacks a soul . I ought to know . You ever heard of a bellwether ? It goes for engines too . There 's one engine that 'll pick up the intervals as they pass through it , and echo them just right . Then all the others will follow . " If I was young like you , I 'd go there myself , " he said . Then he had a coughing fit . He turned purple very quickly , but just as rapidly cooled into blue , and finally breathed easily in white . Asbury wondered how the old man could breathe so little . He seemed to inhale and exhale only a few times each minute . Asbury must have wonderedthis out loud , for when his grandfather was once again in possessionof himself he said , " Because I do n't need oxygen . I 've already come to all my conclusions . I 'm just slowly gliding down . Someday I 'll be as light as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Go to New York . " Asbury had promised . But until the day that the wind had taken him , he had forgotten what he had vowed . Now , after a few sunny days on the sea , he was surrounded by a low-pitched rumble that he took to be the thundering heartbeat of a city , and he had no doubt what city it was . H A R D E S T Y Marratta and Virginia had fallen in love in the obsessiveand total way of two people who have seen the same truth which they can not quite comprehend . And though the times were not as promiscuous as they had been several decades earlier , no one would have blinked had they taken up residence together ( Virginia 's apartment was just barely big enough for three ) or maintained some sort of indecisive relationship that , like many others of its type , was half scandal and half hesitation . But they did n't . Instead , they courted almost as their parents had done . Perhaps it was that , save for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother and Virginia had not known her father . They had been brought up on tender descriptions , and had heard the stories of their parents ' courtshipsin the most glowing terms . And perhaps it was because Virginiahad been unsuccessfully married , and was still wary of visions ,  |p319even  if they were her own ; whereas Hardesty , who had been drafted into combat twice in his life , had already suffered conscription doubly . For whatever the reason , their passion unrolled in a long , easy wave , and they courted , slowly and gently , throughout the severe winter that followed their first meeting . Hardesty lived in the attic of a house on Bank Street . The roof was peaked , and he had to bend when passing through doors , but the neighborhood was quiet and all he could hear apart from the wind and snow was the sound of bells ringing through yards and gardens as churches patiently struck the hours , their halves , and their quarters . Cats and squirrels made astounding leaps and tightroped the telephone lines in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shame . When a cat walked in the snow , it moved like an exiled queen , the epitome of caution and pride . Once , a hawk alighted briefly in the courtyard , but only long enough to look under each of its mottled wings and then rise up . The air was often choked with snow or sweet wood smoke that darkened things and had a way with time , suspending it . And when night came early with its snowy blue light , the world looked like that quiet place depicted in paperweightsfilled with water and confetti . Every afternoon , just as The Sun was put to bed , Hardesty called Virginia from a public phone ( neither had a telephone in the house , believing it a wasteful extravagance ) . They discussed the composition of dinner , and later , as they walked from different directions toward Virginia 's apartment , they gathered ingredients from markets and stores on the way . Sometimes , if Virginia were working late or Hardestyhad finished early , he would meet her in Printing House Square and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , Hardestyhad a solitary walk at dusk down Greenwich Avenue . He thought there was no finer street in the city . Whenever he passed St. Vincent 's Hospital he felt as if he were inside a great Russian novel . Its looming walls and large lighted windows spoke of things eternal ; and seated next to timid interns , in local restaurants with wood fires and evergreen wreaths , were people of fashion and means who seemed in comparison to be astonishingly empty . How could they help it ? The interns carried with them the truths of death and dying , and when they walked across the street in the snow they did not shed thep320strange melancholy of their sleepless and terrible year . Though he felt obliged to carry out the task his father had skillfullyengineered for him in San Francisco , Hardesty was held in place by powerful attractions and satisfying responsibilities . Thinking of how it would be to leave Virginia made him sadder than he could tell . The way things were set up , he would have to betray her . He truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlantic with him or anyone else , having had her sleigh ride to Canada . Thus far , she had successfully held him back . And , then , there was his job . Praeger de Pinto had found in him not just a kindred spirit , but something better  --  a competitor . Praeger was never sure that Hardesty would n't think of what he himself was thinking , beforehand , and , despite what this implied about Praeger , Praeger consideredit a magnificent talent . He had asked Virginia about Hardesty on several occasions , because he wanted to hire him . But he did not know in what capacity : he thought perhaps as a political writer , or a neighborhood reporter , since he had discovered that Hardesty knew Italian . Furthermore , he wanted Hardesty to ask for the job . One Saturday afternoon , they met by accident at a skating pond in Brooklyn . This place was famous for a vista of New York that compressed the city unerringly , so that one could look down the rifle barrel of a long avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting . Sitting on crowded benches in a rectangular yellow building with roaring wood stoves , and windows that faced Manhattan , Praeger , Virginia , and Hardesty had pounded their skate blades on the floor to throw off the ice shavings and then stared in a daze through the ten-degree air . " I wonder what that strange-looking tower is , " Praeger had said , almost to himself , referring to a Moorish campanile of rose-colored stone . And , to his surprise , Hardesty told him . " That 's the Clive Tower , " Hardesty said , " built in 1867 byJohn J. Clive , in honor of his son , who died at Mobile Bay . " Hewent on to discourse about its place in the city , its relation to thehistory of architecture , and the engineers and architects who built it . Praeger asked about other buildings . Hardesty knew most ofthem , and soon the spots of fire that Praeger had set worked themselves into the blaze of a lecture in history , architecture , poetry , andp321thunder  --  a portrait of the city from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hardesty himself . Only when they saw a group of local boys playing hockey by torchlight did they realize that it had grown dark . " How the hell do you know all that ? " Praeger asked . " I 've been reading and walking around a lot . " " What did you do in San Francisco ? " " I did n't do much , " Hardesty confessed . " I was resting after the army . I rested for a couple of years . But when I came back the first time , I managed to get a doctorate in the history of art and architecture . That 's probably what you want to know . " " It makes no difference to me , " Praeger stated , " as long as you know what you 're talking about , and I think you do . Why do n't you write a few pieces for The Sun and The Whale ? If they 're as good as that little dissertation on Western civilization that just went by , you can have a regular column . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added . " You see , " Praeger began , turning toward Hardesty because he knew that Virginia already knew , " The Ghost has an architecture section : section thirty-nine , on Mondays and Fridays . But it 's a personalitiespage . For example , they recently had a piece on a character  --  I think his name was Ambrosio D'Urbervilles  --  whose design statement ' was to stuff an entire apartment from floor to ceiling with dark purple cottonballs . He called it Portrait of a Dead Camel Dancing on the Roof of a Steambath . ' " If we compete with them , we have to do it as if they were something other than what they are . To avoid their influence , we try to pretend that they do n't exist . To counter the mirror-image effect , we fight them as if they were actually serious opponents . This takes much imagination on our part , and elevates them a great deal . But Harry Penn would have it no other way ; and , these days , neither would I. " " I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoves thundering in his ears like sunstroke . " I read the thing about the camel dancing on the roof . " As the hockey players ' torches flew across the night ice under the glow of lighted canyon walls , Hardesty told the editor of The Sun that he would try his best to portray the city.  |p322Within  a week , Hardesty and Marko Chestnut began to wander in search of those places constructed to hold and keep the spirit . These were not hard to find , because they existed literally in the hundreds of thousands , from Riverdale to South Beach , and from Riverside Drive to New Lots . On Thursdays , The Sun ran Hardesty 's commentary across two full pages . In the center of each page was a large pen-and-ink drawing by Marko . They gave The Sun 's readers Brooklyn from the air : there it was , spread out before them like a pinioned eagle trying to eat the ouster of Staten Island . They gave them the chaos of Fourteenth Street , the chimneys of Astoria , silveredsections of the East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Manhattan 's golden spires as seen from Weehawken at sunset , when the city of glass burns like a star in space . The more they found , the more they could see to find , and they did very well by The Sun . But all this only made Hardesty increasingly impatient to see the just city . He resolved to overcome all his feelings and inclinations , and get on a boat to Europe . Though he loved Virginia , loved her even more than he felt responsible to his father , there was something else apart from either of them that drove him on . Its power astounded him and made him think of those men who leave their families to go to war . And now he , too , was about to trade , to take the cold wind for the warm , because of something that was not his own , and that spoke to him from a time so distant that he had to admire it merely for its tenacity . He was wrong to leave , and he knew it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong for the sake of a perfectly just city , was another . He told Virginia on the first of June , and it caught her completelyoff guard . She cried fiercely , and then she attacked him . She tried to pull his hair , and landed a punch or two . " Get out ! " she screamed in rage . When he did get out , she slammed the door and bolted it , and he heard sobbing that broke his heart . After all that , he could n't just knock at the door and step back into the house , so he bought a ticket for a ship that was soon to depart , and went back to his attic , cursing summer . The day that Hardesty left New York he took a taxi through the city on his way to the ocean liner . It was early on a Sundayp323morning in the beginning of June , in perfect weather . Though it was cool , serene , and blue , no one was in the streets but the sun . Passing through Chelsea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that seemed to come from the buildings themselves , their abandoned inner courtyards , and the souls of their inhabitants . He could not have loved Virginia Gamely more , and he wondered if what he assumedlay at such a great distance were present in this very city  --  or even in Virginia herself , if the future were to be fair and imaginativeenough to take refuge in a single soul . If that were so , then he would be doing the wrong thing . Midway through the aria , he saw a familiar figure crossing Hudson Street with an easel over his shoulder and a box of oils under his arm . Marko Chestnut was returning from painting the Hudson early in the morning , when the light was best and gangs of hoodlums were just going to bed . The Hudson was a thousand rivers , changing with each variation of the light  --  mild at dawn , whitecapped in a strong autumn wind , royal blue under an empty sky , covered with white ice , green and gray in winter storms , a mist-covered mountain lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their strong and unambivalent light . Hardesty had the taxi pull over . He jumped out and called to his friend , who was always wary , because he was often attacked when he painted outside . Marko began to scurry away . " It 's me ! " Hardesty shouted . " I thought you left already , " Marko said , squinting through his glasses . " I 'm on my way now . What time is it ? The boat leaves at eight . " Marko Chestnut hesitated , looked at his watch , and said , " It 's seven . How come you left so early ? The pier for the Rosenwald is only three blocks from here . " " I did n't think it was that early . " " Have you eaten yet ? " " No . " " Let 's go to Petipas and have some breakfast , " Marko Chestnut suggested . " We can walk from there to the boat . " They had breakfast in the garden at Petipas , watching birds in the sunlit ivy on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliffs of the Hudson . " How can you leave a woman like that ? And for what ? You know she was left once before , by that Canadian lunatic , what was his name , Boissy d'Anglas ? " " I know , " Hardesty answered . " It 's not fair to her . It 's not fair to you . It 's wrong . Maybe , as a widower , I can know things that you ca n't . But let me tell you something  --  you 're an idiot . You 're throwing away the most precious . . . . For Christ 's sake , do I have to explain this to you ? " " No . " " Then why not just stay . " " I ca n't , " Hardesty whispered . " My father . " A ship 's whistle rent the air . " Is that the Rosenwald ? " Hardesty asked . " It may be , " Marko Chestnut replied . " But if it is , it must be heading downriver . It 's already twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bitch , I 'll remember this ! " Hardesty said with a threatening look . " You 'll thank me , " Marko Chestnut stated confidently . They ran out of the restaurant . Struggling with his easel , Marko Chestnut overturned tables and chairs and broke a lot of china . Hardestyhailed a taxi , and sped south . Marko Chestnut followed . Their two cabs arrived at the Battery simultaneously , and the tourists did not understand what was happening as Hardesty , and Marko Chestnut ( lugging easel and paints ) , ran to the southernmost extension of the promenade , screaming epithets at one another . As trim as an admiral in a new set of whites , the Rosenwald was getting up a good head of steam , and her towering stern had just cleared Liberty Island . Hardesty started to unlace his shoes . " What 's the point of swimming ? " Marko Chestnut asked . " A ship like that goes twenty knots . " " That 's right , and the water 's freezing . I do n't expect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in case it stops . What can I lose except a little body heat ? " He dived into the harbor and began to swim . To Marko Chestnut'samazement , a minute after Hardesty jumped , the Rosenwald sent up a plume of black smoke and went dead in the water.  |p325THE  officers of the Dutch ship Rosenwald were flattered that Hardestyvalued their services enough to immerse himself in the outrageouspudding of filth that passed for water in New York Harbor . They took him down somewhere near the engines and pushed him into a scalding shower , after which the ship 's doctor gave him ten injections , and the chief steward brought him a gallon of beef bouillon . He would have declined an invitation to dine that evening at the captain 's table , had he not been wearing the captain 's own sapphire-coloredvelvet bathrobe with Holland 's royal crest in gold on the pocket . It is difficult , he reasoned , to refuse an invitation from someone in whose bathrobe one is . When Hardesty finally managed to get on deck , he saw New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a piece of flashingjewelry . Nothing of human proportion could be made out amid the blocks and towers . But an occasional dome or the graceful fall of a catenary put the glassy cliffs in scale , and reminded Hardesty that within and among them people were shouting and singing , women were stepping into the shower , and pianos were being played as dancers danced . Virginia was there , somewhere , going about in the summer sun . Not far upriver , newly awakening forests rested betweengreening fields and blue mountains . Here and there , early summer fires built to clear the forest alleyways of fallen limbs sent up smoke that seemed to climb as slowly and carefully as alpinists . It was hard to leave New York in summer , by sea . Hardesty immediately began to miss the city where never-ending avenues jumped over rivers on bridges that habitually bumped the clouds , and where history and the future seemed to run side by side in shock and disorder . And he longed for Virginia . He longed for her so that he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water was far too cold for him to make it . He realized as well that to do so would probably be considered eccentric , especially in light of the way in which he had come on board . Besides , he would probably get chopped up in the propellers , and his clothes were being launderedand pressed , which meant that even if he survived he would
