A vote for Egypt 's great dam <P> Every summer the ancient Egyptians threw a beautiful virgin into the Nile to propitiate the river god . The Nile was Egypt 's lifeblood : its waters renewed the parched land , and its sediment enriched the soil . But at times there was too much water , engulfing fields and villages , or too little , bringing famine and death . <P> In the 1960s , this timeless cycle was broken . With construction of the Aswan High Dam , the largest and most ambitious barrier ever built across the river , the Nile 's annual floods were brought under complete control . A 2,000-sq. - mi. reservoir was created , and , through the dam 's turbines , enough hydroelectric power was produced to meet half of Egypt 's electrical needs . Irrigating canals created a million acres of new farm land . <P> But the Soviet-aided project also generated megawatts of controversy . Environmentalists charged that the dam would rob the Nile Valley of the silt that had made it fertile . They predicted increased salinity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases like schistosomiasis . They also anticipated erosion of the Nile Delta . The great dam became a symbol of Third World development gone awry . <P> Now , in a surprising reassessment , a team of American and Egyptian scientists sharply disputes this view . Speaking at an environmental conference in Israel , Chief Scientist Khalil Mancy , 52 , conceded that the dam has caused severe dislocations . <P> But he added that with the Aswan liabilities have come new benefits . The collapse of the sardine industry in the Delta , for example , has been balanced by the creation of a rich new fishery in the Aswan reservoir . The Nile 's increased salinity turns out to have been exaggerated ; the salt level , the scientists found , is up only 10% to 15% , not yet enough to damage most crops . In fact , the greatest threat to water quality is not the dam but the growing pollution from thriving towns and farms along the now peaceable river 's shore . As for schistosomiasis , it is on the wane . <P> The University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require costly remedies . To halt coastal erosion , dikes will have to be built , and a steadily rising water table may require protection for monuments like the Temple of Karnak . It will be still more difficult to get the 100,000 Nubians displaced by the big lake to adapt to the unfamiliar life of settled farmers on newly arable lands . But even with these problems , Mancy , who first gazed lovingly on the Nile as a youth in Cairo , remains enthusiastic . " Would I build the dam again ? " he asks rhetorically . " I would say yes .
