Americans have always wanted it both ways . From the first tentative settlements in the New World , a tension has existed between the pursuit of individual liberty and the quest for Puritan righteousness , between Benjamin Franklin 's open road of individualism and Jonathan Edwards ' Great Awakening of moral fervor . The temper of the times shifts from one pole to the other , and along with it the role of the state . Government intrudes ; government retreats ; the state meddles with morality , then washes its hands and withdraws . The Gilded Age gave way to the muscular governmental incursions of the Age of Reform . The Roaring Twenties gave rise to the straitlaced Hays Office of the ' 30s . The buttoned-up ' 50s ushered in the unbuttoned ' 60s . And , most recently , a reaction to the sexual revolution spurred a spirited crusade to reassert family values that helped sweep Ronald Reagan into the presidency . <P> Each swing brings to the fore a series of questions . What is the role of the state in enforcing the morality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulating private conduct ? Is morality a question of individual rights ? Or should the state play an active role in nurturing values deemed worthy by the community ? <P> These questions were at the heart of the debate last week surrounding the release of the final report of Attorney General Edwin Meese 's Commission on Pornography and a series of restrictive Supreme Court decisions that , among other things , allowed states to outlaw homosexual sodomy . Though significant , neither the report 's findings nor the court 's rulings were , on their own , momentous . Taken together , however , they seemed emblematic of a new moral militancy evident in communities around the country and of a willingness of government officials , from federal to local levels , to help enforce traditional values . In addition to the pornography report and the sodomy ruling , consider : <P>  --  More than 10,000 stores across the country , including such mammoth chains as 7-Eleven and Rite Aid , have removed Playboy and Penthouse from their shelves , many of them acting after receiving a letter from the Meese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P>  --  The Supreme Court last week upheld a New York State public-health nuisance law that would permit officials in Buffalo to close an adult bookstore for one year because of solicitation for prostitution on the premises . <P>  --  In another decision last week , the court gave a narrow interpretation to the First Amendment in a case involving the suspension of a student who gave a speech colored by sexual innuendo . <P>  --  The court ruled two weeks ago , in a case involving advertising by gambling casinos in Puerto Rico , that even truthful ads for lawful goods and services could be restricted by the state to protect the " health , safety and welfare " of its citizens . <P>  --  The Justice Department issued a ruling that would allow businesses to discriminate against workers with AIDS if there was a fear that the health of other employees was jeopardized.
