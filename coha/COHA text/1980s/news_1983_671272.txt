Today , in both ballet and modern dance , many " obstacles " of plot , symbolism and dramatic pantomime have been swept away and a choreographic work may consist of nothing but dancing to music . Yet , often , such works are facile and pointless . Music - or , to put it more exactly , a certain approach to music - may now constitute a new obstacle to choreographic expression. // There are commentators who praise works that consist solely of steps to music as examples of " pure dance . " But there are times when some things can be so pure as to be colorless or tasteless . At their simplest , pure-dance compositions are little more than displays of energy . In more sophisticated examples of the form , a dance composition offers a visual and kinetic equivalent of a musical composition as translated into some balletic or modern- dance technique . But seldom does this choreography add new dimensions to a score ; it simply puts choreographic linoleum on the floor for dancing. // Although there exist a few choreographers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monumental pieces of music will bring about monumental choreography , most choreographers are modest and avoid grandiose symphonies and oratorios . Yet their tact may result in a work as simultaneously well-crafted and dismaying as Helgi Tomasson ' s " Ballet d ' Isoline , " to Messager , for the New York City Ballet , a piece that is little more than pretty steps to pretty tunes . Such a ballet may be " pure . " Yet it also seems inconsequential. // // Although they may exploit dancers ' technical skills , choreographers are sometimes surprisingly hesitant to offer distinctively personal interpretations of musical scores . Yet , presumably , the scores they choose must mean something important to them . And since no piece of music inevitably requires choreography - music being a self-sufficient art - if choreographers have nothing interesting to say about a piece of music , they might as well leave it unchoreographed. // It is worth noting that , in public statements , Balanchine would disdain fancy interpretations of his ballets and speak as if choreography simply involved setting appropriate steps to a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his remarks too literally. // Balanchine ' s ballets constitute a remarkable set of choreographic visions , raptures , ordeals , quests and exaltations . Balanchine even altered music to suit his own expressive purposes . Thus he lopped off the first movement of Mendelssohn ' s score for " Scotch Symphony " and reversed the order of the last two movements of " Serenade , " even though the reversal destroys the formal symmetry of Tchaikovsky ' s composition . However , that same reversal brings the ballet to an achingly beautiful conclusion. // Balanchine may have insisted upon notions of esthetic impersonality so that he could be free to fill his works with any personal feelings he wished without fearing that viewers would automatically regard each new ballet as a choreographic confession or gossip column . In so doing , he resembles T. S. Eliot , whose critical theories scorned mere self-expression , but whose poetry concerned deeply personal moral and religious struggles . What is important in both Balanchine and Eliot is not the letter of their theories , but the spiritual fire that transfigures their works. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can treat music too reverently . When Peter Martins began choreographing a work to Rossini chamber music for the New York City Ballet , he may have realized that one piece of music was insufficient for a ballet on the scale that he wished . Therefore , he utilized two pieces and the result was " Rossini Quartets . " But the two pieces he chose are so similar as to cancel each other out when one immediately follows the other . Mr. Martins tried hard to make " Rossini Quartets " interesting to look at , but it became dull to listen to . The late John Cranko ran into a comparable problem when he yoked two Bach concertos together for his " Brandenburg Nos. 2 and 4 " for the Royal Ballet. // In contrast , in his " Esplanade , " to Bach , and his " Aureole " and " Airs , " to Handel , Paul Taylor takes individual movements from several different concertos and arranges them in a new order . This may horrify pedants . Yet the musical rearrangements make possible some unusually inventive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no choreographer wishes to get mired in allegory or snarled in subplots . Even so , choreographers often appear to be unusually ill at ease when they use music that was either written for some specific theatrical purpose or given programmatic significance by its composer . If the taste of our time may make choreographers avoid explicitly programmatic dances , their respect for music may make them feel that they must indicate their awareness of a score ' s program , if it originally had one . However , the choreographic results may be too pallid to be satisfactory as dance-drama , yet too annoyingly allusive to allow one to regard the work solely as an abstraction. // For instance , there ' s Joseph Duell ' s " La Creation du Monde , " for the New York City Ballet . Milhaud wrote this score for a 1923 ballet about African mythology . Mr. Duell had no desire to imitate that scenario . Yet , apparently , he felt he ought to acknowledge that he was familiar with the score ' s history . So his ballet does contain moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reticently that they have little impact. // Music , traditionally the choreographer ' s ally , is in danger of becoming the choreographer ' s master and what was initially a liberating Classicism may be turning into a stultifying academicism . To prevent this from happening , choreographers should be encouraged to work directly with musical collaborators so that the creative process can be a mutually rewarding dialogue between dedicated artists . If nothing else , commissioned scores may free choreographers from the constant necessity of having to tailor dances to the structural demands of such traditional forms as the sonata or concerto. // The dance arranger - someone who adapts another composer ' s music for dancing - can also be of help . A sensitive arranger can make existing pieces of music sound as if they had been especially composed for dancing . Thus Simon Sadoff ' s arrangement of Purcell intensifies the power of Jose Limon ' s " The Moor ' s Pavane . " And certain arranged dance scores are so attractive that they are even occasionally heard in concert : among them , William Walton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Wise Virgins , " Vincenzo Tommasini ' s arrangement of Scarlatti for Leonide Massine ' s " The Good-Humoured Ladies " and Manuel Rosenthal ' s arrangement of Offenbach for Massine ' s " Gaite Parisienne. " // Finally , it should not be forgotten that " pure dance " is only one of many valid forms of dance and that whenever any single form becomes stultified , it may be time to reinvestigate the possibilities of another . Of course , the only real solution to choreographic problems is choreographic imagination . But if all choreographers possessed that in abundance , no one would need to worry about how they used music. // //
