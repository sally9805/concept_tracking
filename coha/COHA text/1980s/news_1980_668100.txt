WASHINGTON - " In any year it is difficult , " said one observer of the House . " In an election year it is more difficult , and in an election year with a recession , it ' s excruciating . " It is foreign aid , and in a congressional season of balanced budgets , a faltering economy and a Republican resurgence , the annual appropriations bill for nations abroad seemed doomed from the start to be what Rep. Clarence Long ( D-Md. ) once called " the little pig in the litter . " Since last fall , the Carter Administration , foreign-aid program has been operating about $1.7 billion below its request of $9.2 billion , and the State Department is worried about further cuts in 1981 . The Export-Import Bank has exhausted its funds , and there is growing concern about Washington ' s commitment and influence in the World Bank . As chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee for Foreign Operations , Long tried again last week to come up with new money , but his amendment failed in a stormy floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versus state revenue sharing . " Responsible foreign aid is important . I have always supported it , " said Rep. Margaret Heckler ( R-Wellesley ) , who incurred the wrath of Speaker Thomas P. O ' Neill Jr . by first backing and then opposing the Long amendment . " Foreign aid should never be as high a priority , " she said , " as the sharing of American tax dollars at the state and local level , dollars that flow back to and relieve the tax burden on the average American citizen . " The same political pull between domestic and foreign priorities is seen in reverse in the case of Secretary of State Edmund S. Muskie , who told a New York audience this week , " There is no lack of rhetoric calling for more American leadership in the world . . . . We must be prepared to pay the costs that leadership requires . " As Senate Budget Committee chairman until this spring , Muskie played a different role - he tried to control federal spending . One of the ironies of the failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of State frustrated its sponsors last winter when he prevented any action on the billbecause it threatened the budget ceiling . " He wore a different hat then , " said one Administration official . As much frustration as there is with the amount of foreign aid this year - which is being paid for under a continuing resolution , since no bill was ever passed - there is concern that there will be further cuts or no bill again for fiscal 1981 . The Administration had wanted $9.2 billion for this year ; instead , funding under the continuing resolution has been close to $7.5 billion . This shortfall has hit the development banks especially hard , including the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development , the main branch of the World Bank . Under a House-Senate compromise , which Muskie delayed as Budget chairman and which was never enacted , $350 million more was to go to these banks . Of that sum , $165 million was to go to the World Bank . Established at the end of World War II , the World Bank has never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is considered something of a courtesy because of this country ' s historic commitment to the institution . Robert S. McNamara , the current president , is scheduled to retire next June , and upon the announcement of his resignation , the Bank hinted that a non- American might be chosen as his replacement . Since then Muskie has tried unsuccessfully to get Congress to add funds for the bank , and the defeat of Long ' s amendment last week has added to the concern . " It is enough to raise a question in the mind of the bank , " said one Administration official . " Why should we be having a lead role in the bank if we are going to diddle around and not meet our commitments . " Though traditionally considered a part of " foreign aid , " the Export- Import Bank both predates the World Bank and is a quite different institution . Its function is to encourage American business abroad by providing credit , for example , to facilitate foreign sales , but it has been caught in the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorization is already exhausted , and while there may be an effort to write a special appropriations bill this month to solve this problem , Congress has little if any room left under the budget ceiling it has set for 1980 . The situation is further complicated because the House and Senate must soon recalculate their estimates of all federal spending , and these new figures are likely to show even less room for foreign aid . " We will have to move quickly , " said one bank supporter , " or the window ( the space under the budget ceiling ) will close . " B08005090
