 | In the world of children 's television , cluttered with ephemeral superheroes , such as Transformers and the Real Ghostbusters , the ever low-key Bert , Ernie and Big Bird have achieved the closest thing to immortality . " Sesame Street , " which revolutionized educational programing with an integrated cast and an entertaining format aimed specifically at disadvantaged kids , turns 20 this year , and 11 million U.S. households still watch it every week . The Emmy-award-winning show has become such a cultural force that the Smithsonian 's National Museum of American History is honoring it with a retrospective that will run through October . Despite " Sesame Street 's " undeniable success , the commercial-television industry has been slow to emulate its approach . Saturday mornings remain the time when He-Man , Ninja Turtles and Robocop battle each other in the ratings . Now , advocates of quality children 's TV are hoping President Bush will soon sign legislation forcing networks to devote time to educational programing . Nonprofit profits . Given the financial success of the nonprofit " Sesame Street " ? it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , magazine sales and international television last year ? it seems odd that it would take government intervention to persuade broadcasters to reach out to the preschool audience . The appeal of " Sesame Street " has not been missed elsewhere , either . Eighty-three countries have their own , successful versions of the show . ( In Israel , Big Bird is transformed into a huge hedgehog ; in Mexico , he is a large green parrot . ) Network executives in the U.S. insist that they , too , would love to air such quality shows , but that such productions are not economically viable for them . They point out that " Sesame Street 's " financial success is rooted in spinoff products , a bonus new shows ca n't count on . " Television is not philanthropic , " argues Geraldine Laybourne , president of Nickelodeon/Nick at Nite . " Marketplace conditions demand the most success for the least amount of risk . " Although all shows are expensive to produce , prime-time shows can make a profit by charging advertisers top dollar to reach an audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand , with its narrow underage viewership , is able to charge advertisers only a small percentage of the prime-time rate . From a programer 's perspective , it does n't make sense to spend time or money on a show that by  | definition ca n't bring in huge revenues . Certainly , few commercial shows can afford to devote the time to developing material that " Sesame Street " can . Rather than simply telling kids they should accept those who are different , for example , " Sesame Street " producers chose to have Ray Charles sing the Muppets a special song called " It 's Not Easy Being Green . " The show 's producers also commission original research to find out how and what preschoolers can learn . Next season , for example , the show will tackle geography and ecology in an effort to respond to the nation 's concern over pollution and reports that Americans know little about geography . A new form of viewership rating has also contributed to the current dearth of quality shows directed at preschoolers . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional family-viewing diary system with the people meter , which requires the viewer to punch in a complicated code right at the moment of viewing ? a skill that is beyond most 5-year-olds . As a result , the company has disenfranchised preschoolers , says Squire Rushnell , a vice president of children 's programing for ABC Entertainment . " They 're not measurable , and if they 're not measurable , then they 're nonexistent , " he insists . Since shows for " nonexistent " audiences do n't show up in the ratings , they do not survive . Rushnell points to " The Clowns of Happy Town , " a quality preschool show that ABC first aired at the same time the people meters were introduced . The show was not renewed . Laybourne of Nickelodeon thinks the people-meter impact has been mitigated by the fact that preschoolers often watch television with parents , who can operate the device . But she agrees that the people meter is one more impediment to quality children 's programing . For as much praise as " Sesame Street " garners from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its format . Jerome Singer , psychologist at the Yale University Research and Consultation Center , thinks that kids learn and retain information better with a slow , reflective approach rather than with the fast-paced , some say fragmented , presentation " Sesame Street " offers . The show has adjusted its format in response to such criticism over the years , de-emphasizing its trademark rapid-fire presentation and flashy graphics , which had been designed to capture the attention of kids of the TV generation , accustomed to the bombardment of attentiongrabbing commercials and sound bites . Many of the 1-to-2-minute segments of seasons past have been slowed to 5 to 6 minutes each in the current season . And a greater emphasis is being given to human relations and emotional issues as well as to the alphabet and numbers . A few seasons ago , preschoolers learned about death when the actor who played Big Bird 's friend Mr. Hooper died . His character died , too , and the children were told that he would not be back . Last season , viewers learned what it means to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delivery . Dulcy Singer , " Sesame Street 's " executive producer , is quick to point out that the show now features continuing plot lines within and between shows . For example , next fall , the topic of fire safety will be tackled over several weeks . In one episode , Susan and Gordon 's son , Miles , will have a practice fire drill in school . In another , there will be a drill at home at 123 Sesame Street . Finally , when the smoke alarm goes off one morning , Miles and his parents will know how to escape without injury . But how much of an effect does " Sesame Street " actually have on its young viewers ? Although studies have found that " Sesame Street " does give kids a head start in school , some experts wonder if educational television can really promote interest in learning in a larger sense . " All a good TV show does is make a kid want to watch more TV , just like a good book makes you want to read more books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York University . To see if avid viewers grow up to be avid learners , the Children 's Television Workshop has commissioned a $1.2 million study of the show 's long-term effects . Although children 's educational TV has not caught on the way " Sesame Street 's " creators had first hoped , the importance of its mission has n't gone unnoticed by broadcasters . Next September , Nickelodeon is launching a new show , aimed at preschoolers , called " Eureka 's Castle . " Three psychologists will be consultants , acting as a sounding board for ideas for the music and puppet-based show . Using humor , it will teach kids to handle everyday problems such as how to answer the phone , share with friends and cope with being sick . The show may turn out to be another gem for young television viewers to treasure , but it is not likely to be the start of a trend . For Nickelodeon , the show is an image booster , helping to fulfill its mandate as a kids-only network and to give back to the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castle " is being financed in part with the syndication profits from the gooey hit game show " Double Dare . " The network does n't expect the new show to turn a profit .
