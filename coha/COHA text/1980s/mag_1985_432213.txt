 | If you ever visit the Aero Valley Airport in Roanoke , Texas , to take a flying lesson , you may be surprised to see that your instructor , Edna Gardner Whyte , looks more like a grandmother than a pilot . Mrs. Whyte , the first woman in America to be issued a private pilot 's license , has spent more than 30,000 hours in the air and has trained nearly 5,000 pilots in her 50 years as an instructor . At age 82 she not only still teaches flying , she competes in crosscountry air races . In Edna 's home on the grounds of the Aero Valley Airport , photographs and clippings from her life cover the walls , and the 126 trophies she has won are on display . Clearly , flying is her life . " The most important part of my house is the airplane hangar attached to it , " she laughs . " With my four airplanes right next door and my house full of flight students who come to visit me , I 'm never lonely ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1902 , one of three children of Walter and Myrtle Gardner . When she was eight years old , her father was killed in a railroad accident , and her mother , a teacher , supported the family while Edna cared for her six-yearold brother , Donovan , and sister Vera , 2 . Three years later her mother came down with tuberculosis , and the children were sent to live with relatives until their mother recovered . After graduating from high school , Edna entered nursing school and in 1924 became a registered nurse . " I went to work at a hospital in Seattle , Washington , and that 's when the flying bug bit me , " she said with a chuckle . " A patient I was taking care of asked me if I liked airplanes . I said yes , even though I 'd never even seen one ! " When the patient was discharged from the hospital , he offered to take Edna flying , and she quickly agreed . " Before we left the ground , he showed me how the stick worked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Edna said . " And after we took off , he actually let me fly the plane ! I thought he was a great pilot ? until he made a terrible landing . We hit the ground , bounced hard , and spun around in a complete circle ! " Edna later learned that her " instructor " had only eight hours of flying experience . Despite the bumpy landing Edna enjoyed the flight so much that she continued to take flying lessons whenever she could afford them . She went on her first solo flight in 1927 , got her student license the same year , and in 1929 received the first private pilot 's license ever issued to a woman . " What a time I had getting that license , " she recalled . " The examiner gave me a written test first , and an hour after I had completed it , I was still sitting there waiting to take my test flight . Finally I asked him if I had failed the written test . He said , Why are you trying to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was because I wanted a career in aviation . " The examiner reluctantly took Edna for her test flight , and she easily passed . " But then he said he 'd never given a license to a woman and was n't about to start now ! " I was so frustrated I just burst into tears . It was embarrassing ? but he must have felt sorry for me because I got my license after all . " For a few years Edna pursued flying as a hobby while she continued her nursing career . She joined the Navy 's nursing corps , and in 1931 , while she was stationed at a hospital in Newport , R.I. , she met Amelia Earhart . " Amelia was recruiting women pilots for a new group she was forming ? the International Organization of Licensed Women Pilots , nicknamed the " 99 's " because there were 99 charter members . One of them was me . " The last time I saw Amelia was in May of 1937 . We had dinner together just before she left for her flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She told me she was worried about her plane 's radio . She had removed the antenna from her plane because she thought she 'd have more speed without it ? but then she reconsidered and decided she 'd better have it put back . " Unfortunately , the antenna was never put back and Amelia Earhart 's plane was lost in the South Pacific . She was never heard from again . " We lost a fine pilot when we lost Amelia , " Edna said sadly . " She did so much for women in aviation . " I n 1935 Edna decided that she , too , would try for a career in aviation . She applied for several positions but found that nobody wanted to hire a woman pilot . So she decided to become a flight instructor instead . " I applied for a job at a flight school in New Orleans , but the two men who owned the school just did n't want to hire a woman , " she said . " I begged them to give me a chance , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Edna 's good-humored patience and her skill as a pilot made her very popular with the flight students . " When I saw how many of them wanted to fly with me , I decided to start my own flight school , " she said with a smile . " What better way to earn a living than doing what I loved best ? " She obtained a bank loan using her car as collateral and bought her first plane on credit . Before too long she had so many students that she expanded her business , borrowing more money to buy four additional planes . Her former employers , furious at her , accused Edna of stealing their students and told her they 'd ruin her . The airport became a war zone as they raced their planes past hers or cut her off in midair . But Edna refused to be intimidated . When they could n't frighten her , they tried a new tactic : filing complaints against her with the Civil Aviation Authority . " One day when a student of mine was attempting a landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane over , " Edna recalled . " Fortunately , he was n't hurt , and since there was no damage to the plane , we turned it rightside up ? it was a very light two-seater ? and flew it back to the airport . The next thing I knew my former employers reported me for flying an unsafe air-craft ! " Several weeks later a man from the C.A.A . came to see me and said he was going to revoke my license . I was devastated . If I lost my Iicense , I 'd lose my business , too , because I was still making payments on my planes . So I hired a lawyer and fought back . " After a month-long court battle the C.A.A . finally agreed that I had been set up and returned my license . But by that time I had spent some $5,000 defending myself . " Edna continued to teach until 1941 ;  | then , like millions of other Americans , her life was interrupted by World War II . The Navy sent her to train pilots at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1944 she served as a nurse in the Philippines and also flew huge transport airplanes filled with wounded servicemen to base hospitals . After the war Edna returned to Fort Worth . With money borrowed from the government she started Aero Enterprises , a flight-training school for war veterans who wanted to become pilots . Aero Enterprises became so successful that she had to hire several flight instructors to help with the work load . Then , at the age of 44 , something totally unexpected happened to Edna : She fell in love with George Whyte , one of the flight instructors she 'd hired . " I had never been in love with a man before , " Edna said with a laugh . " Every time a man got interested enough in me to talk about marriage , I 'd compare him to my plane ? and then I 'd choose the plane every time ! " After a three-month courtship Edna and George were married , and the years that followed were the happiest of her life . George became Edna 's business partner , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? caring for George 's eight-year-old daughter , Georgana , by a previous marriage . At first Edna found raising a stepdaughter to be much more difficult than she expected . " Georgana and I just did n't understand each other , " she said . " She went from our home back to her mother 's on a rotating basis , which was hard for all of us . " But I tried to make her happy . I gave parties for her , taught her to fly , and we became much closer . Of course , we had a few bad times , too , but what parent does n't ? " Georgana is married now , and she 's an expert pilot , " Edna said proudly . " She 's had offers to teach flying but turned them all down because she wanted to stay home with her two young children . " In 1968 George and Edna 's happiness came to an abrupt end when George , a chain smoker , developed a cancerous sore on his lip . He underwent surgery to remove it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst was yet to come . Two months later Edna noticed that George was limping . When she asked him why , he said his right foot was so sore he could n't put weight on it . Edna looked at his foot and discovered his skin was almost black in color . " I took him straight to the hospital , " she said quietly . " After examining him , the doctors said he had gangrene . They suspected a small untreated blister had led to gangrene because his circulation was so impaired by his heavy smoking . For months they treated the foot with medication , but it did n't get any better . Eventually they had to amputate his leg at the knee . " George never regained his health following the amputation . Because he could no longer fly , the Whytes sold their business and Edna taught flying several hours a week at another flight school , devoting the rest of her time to taking care of George . The cancer that had started as a tiny sore on his lip had now spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaker . " George and I had always dreamed of building our own airport , and sick as he was , George still wanted to do it , " Edna said . " So in 1969 we bought twenty-four acres of land in Roanoke , Texas , for our airport . But just a few months later the cancer spread to George 's lungs . I knew then that he was n't going to make it . " George died in March of 1970 . " It was the worst time of my life , " Edna said sadly , " but flying kept me going . Whenever I missed George , I went flying ? I knew that 's what he would have wanted me to do . " She also knew he would want her to fulfill their dream of  | building an airport of their very own . In 1972 , when she was 70 , she decided it was time to turn the dream into a reality . She went to the Small Business Administration to apply for a loan , but they refused her , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . But Edna did n't give up . She raised the money herself by selling some of her planes ( she owned 12 aircraft at the time ) and borrowing from friends . Late in 1972 she opened Aero Valley Airport . Her business cards read , Friendly Aero Valley Airport ? Growing Without Federal Money ! Single-handedly she built Aero Valley into a thriving aviation facility . Today the airport hangars 360 airplanes , has three flight schools , and specializes in restoring antique aircraft . Though she sold the airport a few years ago , Edna still teaches flying several hours a day . " I 'm glad to see that so many of my students today are women , " she remarked . " Aviation is full of opportunities for them ? they can be corporation or commercial pilots , work for the Weather Bureau , or be an FAA controller , among other things . " T hough teaching is her first love , Edna said she still enjoys air racing . In April of 1984 she completed the grueling 2,100-mile American Grand Prix Air Race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing for as long as I can pass my physical , " Edna said . " I just would n't be happy sitting in a rocking chair . " Edna has always prided herself for having a perfect safety record ; however , in August 1984 she had her only accident in 58 years of flying . She and one of her students were practicing emergency landings when the landing gear of Edna 's plane hit a wire hidden by trees . Using the techniques that she had been teaching the student when the accident occurred , Edna minimized the impact . Although the student was n't hurt , Edna fractured her nose and had to be hospitalized for a few days . " I was more concerned about the plane than myself , " Edna joked . " It was a total wreck ? not even good for parts ! " She admitted that it was a frightening experience , but said that in all her years of flying she 's never been afraid while at the controls of an airplane . " That 's because I 'm never alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the window at the cloudless blue sky . Smiling , she continued , " I believe in God , and He 's always taken care of me . My airplane helps me when I 'm up there ? but I know it 's God who keeps me out of trouble ! "
