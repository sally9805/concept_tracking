Andrei Gromyko 's trip to the U.S. has given new urgency to a task that preoccupies Western experts on Soviet affairs : interpreting the current murky status of the Kremlin leadership . Says a top U.S. analyst in Washington : " We 've got to get a better fix on who is running the show . This ignorance could really screw up our decisions . " <P> The mystery facing the specialists deepened with the brief , repeated appearances on Moscow television last week of a strikingly frail Soviet Leader Konstantin Chernenko . The General Secretary , who took office in February , had vanished from public view on July 13 , ostensibly to enjoy a summer vacation . He had been seen only once after that , presenting medals to three cosmonauts in a ten-minute film clip on the Sept. 6 Moscow evening news . <P> Chernenko 's latest appearances , within days of his 73rd birthday , were hastily arranged . One occasion was the presentation of the Order of Lenin to Harilaos Florakis , head of the pro-Soviet Communist Party of Greece . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks earlier . He leaned on the corner of a desk for support and had difficulty breathing as he read his prepared text . Three nights later , Chernenko turned up again on the news program , giving a strained , five-minute message to the Finnish people . <P> The strange vignettes only confirmed what most Western analysts have suspected : Chernenko is in precarious health . In an effort to determine the extent of his illness , CIA experts have been running the Soviet-made clip of his Sept. 6 appearance through a sophisticated film analyzer , frame by frame . Their conclusion : snippets were cut from the film to eliminate some of Chernenko 's more obvious stumbles and trembling . Although an exact prognosis can not be made from a piece of celluloid , it is clear , says a senior British diplomat , that Chernenko " does not look like a man with too long to go before incapacity or death removes him from the scene . " The Soviet leader is known to suffer from emphysema and a heart condition . <P> The real problem lies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of Chernenko 's health and the way decisions are being made in the twelve-man Soviet Politburo . Specialist opinion varies widely , but there is broad agreement that the Kremlin is preoccupied by the recurring problem of succession . The process is more complicated and painful than usual because it is the third period of uncertainty in two years ( Leonid Brezhnev died in November 1982 , Yuri Andropov last February ) . The upshot , says Harvard University Professor Richard Pipes , is " a profound crisis and lack of direction . " Kremlinologist Marshall Goldman of Wellesley College in Massachusetts calls the Politburo situation " the worst of all circumstances . Everyone knows Chernenko is sick , so no change is possible .
