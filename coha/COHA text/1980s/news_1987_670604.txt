But when he ordered a seminary in St. Petersburg closed in 1918 , the faculty migrated to this pleasant Polish town and founded what became the only Catholic university - for that matter , the only private university - in the East bloc. // The Catholic University of Lublin is twice intriguing . It turns out qualified people outside of state-controlled institutions , but more than that it is a power base for the church at a time when the church is edging toward a greater say in public affairs because of disorientation in the Communist Party. // The university has operated without interruption except for five years after 1939 , when the Nazi occupiers of Poland closed it . The Communists enabled its revival after the war . Soviet troops under Nikolai A. Bulganin liberated Lublin in July 1944 and installed a Communist Government that ordered the university opened to re-establish a semblance of normalcy . <> <> ' A Comic Situation ' // " It was quite a comic situation , " said Jerzy Cieszkowski , the university secretary . He said a delegate of Poland ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university , while the Minister of Education in the Communist Government ordered : " If you don ' t open we ' ll nationalize you. " // " So we reopened , " Mr. Cieszkowski said , " and it was curious . On old photographs you see Bulganin , in uniform , at the inauguration of the academic year. " // Nowhere in Communist Europe is the Roman Catholic Church so intertwined with society as in Poland , and the university affords Poland ' s church a training school as it searches for a role in dispelling a national crisis of the spirit that set in after martial law . But the school also tests tolerance toward private groups that march to another drummer than the party ' s. // " For some time I ' ve observed the emergence of many small groups - among workers , youths - and the authorities don ' t crush them , but tolerate them , " said Wieslaw Chrzanowski , dean of the law school . " In my opinion , the social pressure of such small groups gives the sense that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some form of pluralism. " // Professor Chrzanowski , a former adviser to the Solidarity trade union who was forced out of a state research institute two days after martial law was declared in 1981 , illustrates how the university intertwines with society and how the currents of church and politics intermingle. // " To accept Solidarity now is quite impossible , " he said . " It is not possible to reconstruct it in the same form . We must try many independent groups , nothing so global. " // The university , with about 4 , 300 students and about 400 professors , is no ivory tower , and its relation with the country ' s Communist leaders is not a dispassionate affair . <> <> Years of Harassment // It was harassed under the Stalinist rulers of the early 1950 ' s , when professors who would not conform were forced out and others were pressured with trumped-up charges of financial irregularities . In 1968 , when Jews became the target of intense Government discrimination , the university harbored Jewish students dimissed from state schools. // There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanities and social sciences - and the school defines its role as provider of leaders for the Roman Catholic Church . Most senior church officials are alumni . Stefan Cardinal Wyszynski , the Primate in the tense postwar years , graduated from the law school . Karol Cardinal Wojtyla , now Pope John Paul II , lectured in the philosophy department. // " We must as Catholics have our own standpoint , " said Professor Chrzanowski of the law school . " We need specialists - in family law , even criminal law , the philosophy of law . The church is a large institution , it needs legal experts. " // The school ' s economics department specializes in small business and agriculture , potentially fruitful areas for private entrepreneurs , though state-run companies sometimes give financial help to students they hope to employ after graduation. // Pragmatism in money matters shows up elsewhere . The school is financed largely by donations from Polish Catholics . When plans were drawn up for a new John Paul II center , a state-run construction company bid $35 million to put up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracting company that expects to do the work for $10 million . <> <> Tensions Have Lessened // The links with the Government are less tense than in the past . In 1980 and 1981 the authorities permitted the reopening of several departments that were closed in the 1950 ' s , including modern languages , the social sciences and law . The authorities recently approved construction of the new wing , which will be financed by contributions from North America and will enable the university to double its enrollment. // The school traces its roots to the theological faculty of the University of Vilnius , now in the Soviet Union , whose Polish professors were forced to St. Petersburg by the czar for their part in the unsuccessful 1830 uprising against Russia. // After the Bolshevik Revolution , the priests were expelled and went to Lublin , where they were housed in a diocesan library until 1922 , when Jozef Pilsudski , Poland ' s leader between the wars , gave them a former army barracks as quarters. // The university is a kind of barometer of church-state relations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cieszkowski said , " we know it here . " <> <> A Search for Cooperation // Lately , the Government is trying to win over the church for greater cooperation . But there is a cautionary sense that this might only reflect the party ' s weakness and will not last . " The authorities tolerate a lot of groups , " Professor Chrzanowski said , " but of course they don ' t want to legalize them. " // " I remember in October 1956 , there were also about 150 groups , mostly discussion clubs , " he said . " But in March 1957 , the Interior Minister published a communique reminding people that every organization had to be registered . If not , in one month it would be crushed. " // The Rev. Marian Kurdzialek , a historian of philosophy , described the signs in Poland as ambivalent. // " We are not convinced that things will change quickly , " he said. // " If you discuss principles , that would not be reform of political conditions , but a reform of Marxism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system . So , you can not serve two lords . You have to decide. " // The philosopher comes to an uncomfortable conclusion . If the church spoils relations with the people , Father Kurdzialek said , " No cardinal , no pope can help. " // " Credibility , " he added , " is our only authority. " //
