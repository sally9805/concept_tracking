The Senate rejects a constitutional amendment <P> As the afternoon wore on , the crowd outside the Capitol grew larger and louder . Demonstrators carried placards demanding the return of God to America 's classrooms . Television evangelists addressed the crowd through megaphones as journalists jostled for position . Inside the Senate chamber , Majority Leader Howard Baker announced : " The hour is at hand to stop talking and start voting . " All 100 members came to the floor during the 52 minutes of roll calls as Vice President George Bush ceremoniously acted as presiding officer . But the final tally left many prayers unanswered . The vote last week on a proposed constitutional amendment to permit organized praying in public schools was 56 to 44 in favor , eleven votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to approve the measure . <P> If the amendment had been passed by a two-thirds majority of the Senate and the House and subsequently ratified by three-fourths of the states , it would have overturned a series of Supreme Court decisions . Dating back to 1962 , they declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Amendment . <P> The rejection of the amendment was particularly disappointing for President Reagan . A longtime supporter of school prayer , Reagan revived the issue in this election year as a way to rally his conservative core constituency . Even though the Executive Branch has no official constitutional role in the amendment process , Reagan endorsed a version of the proposal that would have permitted spoken prayer in classrooms . When conservative Republican Orrin Hatch drew up an alternative proposal permitting only silent prayer , correctly arguing that it would have a better chance of passage , Reagan pressured him into backing down . <P> The President mounted a low-pitched lobby , inviting Republicans Robert Stafford of Vermont and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania to the White House for some friendly persuasion . As he left the Oval Office , Stafford said to Reagan , " Of all the Presidents I 've known , from Eisenhower to you , you 're the hardest to say no to . " But both Senators did indeed say no , along with 16 other Republicans and 26 Democrats . Political pressure appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year , 20 voted for the amendment . Of the 67 Senators not up for reelection , 34 voted no . <P> Opponents hammered away at the weak spots in the measure : the problem of who would decide the wording of school prayers ; the possibility of offending children from families of minority religious beliefs ; and the fundamental issue of the separation of church and state . Connecticut Republican Lowell Weicker , who led the opposition , concluded the Senate debate by asking his colleagues , " Why forfeit our birthright of religious liberty for a mess of speculative , political pottage ? " <P> Taking the floor after the vote , North Carolina 's conservative Republican Jesse Helms exclaimed , " Mr. President , we have just begun to fight ! " Most Senators , however , wandered out of the chamber , apparently relieved that the voting was behind them . The controversy may persist , but the issue in the Senate and House is dead , at least for this year . If the President is reelected , the school-prayer amendment will most likely be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go on . "
