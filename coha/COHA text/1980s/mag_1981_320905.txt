Training financial planners <P> Until a few years ago , personal financial planning was a service for the very rich provided by full-time family lawyers and investment managers . Middle-and upper-income people generally had to make do on their own in a topsy-turvy investment world where the rules for efficient use of money have become shredded shibboleths . A penny saved is no longer a penny earned ; it might well be a penny lost to higher taxes and inflation . <P> Enter the certified financial planner , a new breed of personal financial consultant with expertise on how to help people make the most of their money . C.F.P.s assist families in straightening out finances , dealing with high interest rates , saving effectively and managing their debts . Says William Anthes , 38 : " Many people should be living a lot better than they are . There are families making $50,000 that are feeling pressed but should n't . " <P> Anthes is in a position to know . He is president of Denver 's campusless College for Financial Planning , a nine-year-old institution whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a current enrollment of 5,200 . Mainly through correspondence courses backed by rigorous testing at 140 centers throughout the U.S. , the college turns out C.F.P.s trained in such areas as risk management , taxes and investments , and estate planning . <P> Many of the college 's students already have some training in law or accounting ; one is a marriage counselor who wants to deal effectively with marital money difficulties . C.F.P. does not yet have the status of C.L.U. ( chartered life underwriter ) or C.P.A. ( certified public accountant ) , but Anthes and his fellow faculty members hope to change that by funneling more people through 18 to 24 months of courses at a tuition of $850 . About 50% of the college 's graduates belong to the Institute of Certified Financial Planners , which in January will begin setting education standards for its members . The Atlanta-based International Association of Financial Planners claims 8,200 members . As of now , there are no licensing requirements anywhere in the U.S. , and almost anyone with a pocket calculator can call himself a financial planner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are people calling themselves planners who are n't really qualified . " <P> Once trained , C.F.P.s do very well , commanding hourly fees ranging from $50 to $150 and flat fees of $300 or more , depending on the size of a family 's income . Richard Silverstein , a C.F.P. working in Los Angeles , earns more than $100,000 a year . And the market is growing . Families earning $25,000 to $50,000 are the ones most in need of planning , and the number of those households has more than tripled since the mid ' 70s.
