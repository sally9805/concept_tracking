txt HAVE YOU TOLD your son that a 10 Per cent annual rate of inflation means that a pair of shoes that cost him $20 at age 18 will cost him $40 when he Is 26 ; 580 when he is 34 ; 5160 when he is 42 ; and 6640 by the time he is 58 ? A little pamphlet with this question gread over three pages was distributed five years ago by the Leslie Analytical Organization of Chicago . The only change in the figures today would be up . That 's the bad news . We grasp for any good , and found a small ray of sunshine deep in the Wall Street Journal . Most economists expect inflation to stay in double digits this year . A few who are considered somewhat adventurous think it might be 8 or 9 per cent . BUT A DARING projection of 6 per cent or less inflation comes from Gert Von der Linde , chief economist at the Donaldson , Lufkin &; . Jenrette financial house . Stability in food and energy are factors , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 29 per cent of the consumer price index . We hope he 's right and the majority is Wrong . If he is , there 'll be a cost ? unemployment and harder times for homeowners , savings institutions , real estate developers , contractors , mortgage bankers , and construction workers , von der Linde warns . The Reagan administration also predicts 6 per cent or less inflation if Congress enacts its program , though it may take more than a year . The Reagan people say it will hurt a lot of people and businesses to get Inflation under control , but when it 's done , everybody will be happier . MOPE FOR GUN CONTROL : My re . gird for Bob Hope went up a few notches this week when he told a radio interviewer he 's for gun control . I did n't see any news stories on it , and only heard a radio news account , but Hope ? said approximately , " I 've got to talk to the President about this . There 's no reason why guns should n't be licensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunters of any of their rights . " BREATHING IS IN : I was surprised at the number of people who , like myself , do deep breathing to relieve tension , headaches , and in one case , kidney stone pains . That last one seems a little far out , but a Chicago man says that by deep breathing , " I was able to control pain from kidney stone attacks , and was able to pass the stone some two months later myself . " There is a difference of opinion over whether the benefits of deep breathing are physiological or psychological . One caller said : " You know what you 're doing ? It 's self-hypnosis . There is n't any physical change . You 're hypnotizing yourself . " That 's fine with me . I do n't question why it works , if it works . And as I said last week , there 's no way you can hurt yourself with this prescription . And the price is right . LEADERSHIP : U.S , Rep. Paul Simon ( D. , Carbondale ) wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of House Speaker " Tip " O'Neill are increasing . He predicted that the Republican House leader , Bob Michel of Peoria , will be a similar target " before the year is out . " Simon was wrong . They started after Michel before the week was out . The problem is not with these leaders , Simon says . It is with changes in the House procedures and attitudes . " The most fundamental change today is that members on both sides are taking polls for everything , determining what public opinion is before they take a stand , " Simon says . " Many of these members were elected by following the prevailing winds of public opinion , and they stay in office that way . " Appeals by national leaders , even a ' President or speaker , mean little . These members are like hot air balloons , gorgeous to behold in their ascent , but if you probe deeply for substance , you wilt hear the hiss of air escaping . " ( Simon is such a gentleman he did n't say " hot air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The right medicine rarely tastes good , Simon says . People elected to public office inevitably face the question of whether they were elected to mirror the wants , needs , ideas , prejudices , and mistakes of their constituents , or to study problems , assemble facts , and use their best judgment . Followers take the first course , leaders the second .
