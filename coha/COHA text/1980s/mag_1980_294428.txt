DES DAUGHTERS <P> Some 2 million pregnant women had taken DES ( diethylstilbestrol ) to help prevent miscarriage before the Food and Drug Administration alerted physicians to its dangers in 1971 . Doctors suspected that the estrogen drug was causing vaginal and cervical cancer in daughters born to those women , and more recently have also implicated it in genital abnormalities and infertility in sons . Now there is more unsettling news for DES daughters . When they reach childbearing age , they appear to be more vulnerable than others to miscarriage-as well as to stillbirth , premature birth and ectopic pregnancy ( in which the fetus grows outside the uterus ) . Dr. Ann Barnes of Massachusetts General Hospital studied 1,236 women , half of them DES daughters . She reports in the New England Journal of Medicine that the risk of not achieving a full-term birth was 69% higher for DES daughters than for others . Barnes also offers some reassurance : 81% of the DES daughters who became pregnant still achieved at least one full-term live birth ( the rate for non-DES women is 95% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group was small , DES can not be definitely implicated in the miscarriages . <P> <P> LIFE AND DEATH BETS <P> Many a gambler in the gaudy casinos of Las Vegas has staked the last of his cash on a " life or death " bet . But literally ? That seems to have been the case at the city 's Sunrise Hospital last week , where some overnight nurses and aides apparently placed bets on when terminally ill patients in their ten-bed intensive care unit would die . According to the Las Vegas newspapers , one nurse , known as " Death 's Angel , " pulled plugs on the life support systems of as many as six patients . Rather than protest her actions , some co-workers apparently treated the deaths as an opportunity for wagering . The bizarre game came to light when another nurse overheard comments in the cafeteria about " Death 's Angel . " David Brandsness , the hospital 's administrator , calls the charges " as serious as any that could be made in the health-care profession . " <P> <P> TEST-TUBE KIDS <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Norfolk General Hospital in Virginia , some 3,000 women have applied for admission . So far , only 35 have been selected for the treatment ( cost : $3,500 to $4,000 ) , in which an egg is removed from a patient 's ovary and fertilized in a Petri dish with her husband 's sperm , then inserted into the uterus . <P> Now comes word that as many as half a dozen women at the clinic have been impregnated . Though it is far too early to predict how many of them will carry their babies to full term , Drs . Howard Jones Jr . and Georgeanna Seegar Jones , the husband-and-wife directors of the clinic , have expressed hope for a 50% success rate . Thus the odds seem to favor the birth , late this year , of the first U.S. test-tube baby . <P> <P> DEATH BY FRIGHT
