Continuing a bad tradition <P> Short-lived rallies aside , the past few years have not been good to most owners of common stocks , and 1981 was no exception . Mauled by high interest rates , uncertainty over Reaganomics and nervousness over recession , stock prices failed to catch fire after climbing to the year 's high back in April . With only a few days of trading left this year , the Dow Jones industrial average , the most widely watched market indicator , stands at 873 , down 91 points from the 964 closing on the last day of 1980 . <P> That is hardly heartwarming . But neither is it cause for depression or panic selling , says Dow Watcher and Market Analyst William M. LeFevre , 54 , of the New York investment firm of Purcell , Graham &; Co . The market , he says , is behaving as it almost always has during the first year of a Republican Administration . <P> LeFevre is one of a handful of Wall Street gnomes who try to discover a correlation between events and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 30 Dow industrial stocks through the first year of Republican and Democratic Administrations going back to William McKinley in 1901 . LeFevre discovered that the Dow rose during the period for every Democratic President from the fourth Inaugural of Franklin Roosevelt to Lyndon Johnson . The only exception in recent times was Jimmy Carter 's first year , 1977 , when the indicator dropped by 17% . <P> But for Republican Presidents , the opposite is true . The Dow fell an average 12.4% in the twelve months after the Inaugurations of Herbert Hoover , Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard Nixon . It is down in 1981 too , by about 9% . <P> LeFevre also found trends that are more encouraging for Republicans after the first year of new Administrations . Prices for stocks in the Dow industrial average go up smartly : about 13% in the second year , 20% in the third and 6% in the fourth . LeFevre explains that this is because Republican Presidents sensitive to looming congressional elections traditionally stimulate the economy at about the time their second year in office starts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupant of the White House that unless he gets the voters in a good mood , he is going to lose a lot of seats in Congress . " <P> If history holds true for this Administration , says LeFevre , stock prices should now begin rising in a fairly steady 32-month rally . They should then peak in August of 1984 , when the Dow will reach 1345.61 , almost 300 points above its all-time high of 1051 , set in January 1973 . <P> Investors will not have to wait as long to see if another of LeFevre 's theories proves correct . This is his Super Bowl indicator . After 13 of 15 contests since 1967 , the market has gone up the year in which the National Football Conference team won the Super Bowl , and down when the American Football Conference team was the victor . So the best gauge-in chartist terms-for Wall Street activity in 1982 is Super Bowl XVI , which will be held on Jan. 24 in the Silverdome in Pontiac , Mich . Watch closely . Then buy or sell .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
