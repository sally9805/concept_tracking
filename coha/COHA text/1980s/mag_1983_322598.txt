Vermilion 's chairman at 99 <P> Although confined to a wheelchair , with failing eyesight and hearing , J. Fred Boyd has no notion of quitting as chairman of Vermilion Bay Land , a Louisiana oil-and-gas company he helped start 39 years ago . He gets monthly reports on company affairs , and attended all three of the company 's board meetings last year . Last week in Detroit , he attended his 50th consecutive annual meeting , where he was elected to his 13th term as chairman . The only thing unusual about all this is that he is 99 years old . <P> Boyd began his career in the early 1900s , selling typewriters . He later opened an office-supply business in Muskegon , Mich. , and was that city 's first Ford dealer . In 1928 he invested in the Mount Forest Fur Farms of America , which raised muskrats . The company went bankrupt in 1931 . He helped reorganize the failed firm as Vermilion Bay , and the company struck it rich when oil and gas were later discovered on the Louisiana muskrat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land in Louisiana . Last year the company had profits of $1.6 million on sales of $6.2 million . It has only four employees and obviously no mandatory retirement age . Vermilion has a pension plan , but Boyd is not included . <P> With C.W Sunday , 61 , handling the firm 's daily responsibilities as president , Boyd 's position has rarely been challenged , and he is still consulted on major decisions . Last year John Augustine , a Michigan stockbroker , was soundly defeated in his bid for a director 's seat because of his failure to win Boyd 's approval . This year Boyd 's only opposition was a shareholder who circled the chairman 's age in the proxy and wrote : " This is absurd . " Boyd , who , with his wife Helen , is the second largest shareholder , with a 16.4% stake , won re-election with 84% of the voting stock . On Oct. 25 , American business is due to get the first known centenarian chairman of the board .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
