7 t is early afternoon as I walk up I to Jimmy Stewart 's Tudor-style home in Beverly Hills . A small van crammed with tourists on a " See the Stars ' Homes ! " tour quickly comes to a stop in the street . They press their noses against the van 's windows and wait expectantly . I ring the bell . The door opens and Jimmy Stewart stands framed in the entryway . He looks as if he had just stepped out of a vintage Norman Rockwell painting . His gangling 6 ' 31/2 " frame is attired in a blue blazer , gray slacks , and a maroon tie ; he blends perfectly with the Ivy League feel of the brick house . Stewart shakes my hand ; then , seeing the bus , he waves at the tourists . " You .. ah . . . waal ... you 'd better wave , " he says in the world 's most imitated voice , a mixture of corn syrup , stammer , and pure fun . I wave . Jimmy waves . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " Hi , Jimmy ! " muffled by the sealed windows of the van . " Well , now . . . come on . . come on in , " Jimmy Stewart says . He waves one last time and then closes the door behind us . I wonder aloud whether overenthusiastic fans ever get off the bus and knock on his door . " Oh , sure , " he says , leading me into the living room . His walk , at age 80 , is still the familiar Stewart gait , like a circus clown on spindly stilts . " They . . . they want me to autograph something , or mostly just to say hello , " he says . " Does n't that interfere with your privacy ? " I ask . Then a different thought hits me . " Or do you feel you belong to the public ? " I ask . " Absolutely , " he replies . " I do n't feel that my private life is my own . I must devote some of my life to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long ago someone told me that even though I might become a star in the movies , always remember this  --  never treat your audience as customers  --  always treat them as partners . I 've never forgotten that . It 's ... it 's a tremendous piece of advice , " he says . For five decades Jimmy Stewart 's " partners " have applauded his down-to-earth qualities , both on and off the screen . The ideal father , he attended PTA meetings and marched in Boy Scout parades . He 's the decent guy who 's long been a staunch member of the Beverly Hills Presbyterian Church . He 's the patriotic American who flew 20 combat missions in World War II . He 's the nice guy who 's never had a scandal attached to his name , and he 's been married to the same woman for more than 38 years . Once described as " the most normal of all Hollywood stars , " James Stewart is still the " aw , shucks " kid on the block , the " Mr. Nice Guy " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world of fans . Stewart 's 1940 MGM biography stated : " His type is as normally average as the hot dog and pop at Coney Island . " Moviedom 's moguls capitalized on his ideal American appeal by casting him in parts that projected that image . His first big hit , Mr. Smith Goes to Washington , established him not only as " Mr. Average Nice Guy " but also as an exceptionally talented actor . In Mr. Smith , Stewart played Jefferson Smith , a decent , trusting person who by fluke is appointed senator by his state 's crooked party machine . The climax of the film is Smith 's filibuster on the floor of the U.S. Senate to prevent his fellow senators from voting on his expulsion . The scene was a grueling one for Stewart . " Grueling is as good a word as any , " Stewart remembers . " The hardest thing for me was trying to fake the hoarseness in my voice as the filibuster went on . " As he recalls the story , Stewart begins to speak in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day 's shooting , the director , Frank Capra , came up to me and said , ' Jim , you do n't sound as if you 're losing your voice ; you sound as if you 're faking it . ' Now , that really worried me , so on the way home I stopped at an ear , nose , and throat doctor and went in and said , ' Is there any way you can give me a sore throat ? ' " And he just looked at me kinda puzzled and said , ' I 've heard you Hollywood people are crazy , but you take the cake . It 's taken me 30 years to learn how to keep people from getting a sore throat , and now you come in here and want me to give you one . O.K. , I 'll give you the worst sore throat you 've ever had in your life ! ' So I said , ' Well . fine . ' " The doctor agreed to accompany Stewart on the movie set the next day . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vile mercury solution that swelled and irritated the vocal cords . " I could hardly talk , " Stewart remembers . " Hurt something terrible , but it worked ! " Stewart 's medically aided tour de force in Mr. Smith garnered a 1939 Academy Award nomination , the first of five . Stewart and Clark Gable ( for Gone with the Wind ) were rated as equal favorites to win , but Robert Donat took home the prize as the schoolmaster in Goodbye , Mr. Chips . A year later Stewart did win the Oscar for his portrayal of a young newspaperman in The Philadelphia Story . Whatever genre Stewart has performed in , from westerns ( Winchester ' 73 ) to mysteries ( Rear Window ) , from biographies ( The Spirit of St. Louis ) to sentimental tales ( It 's a Wonderful Life ) , he has never subordinated his own image to that of the character he portrayed . Asked if hereally plays himself on the screen , he replies , " I think I like Laurence Olivier 's answer . He said , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I guess that 's what I try to do too . " Jimmy Stewart stands quietly in his living room , surrounded by photographs and mementos of a life he has shared with millions of moviegoers . On the black surface of a grand piano are framed photographs of his wife , Gloria , and their four children ; pictures of Stewart with Ronald Reagan ; and a color shot of Gloria and Jimmy with Pope John Paul II . Stewart points to an oil painting on the wall and says , " Hank Fonda painted that . It 's of my horse , Pie . He died two days after Hank finished painting it . I rode him for 20 years in my western movies . " A skilled horseman , Stewart made some 18 westerns , ranging from his first 1939 comedy role in Destry Rides Again with Marlene Dietrich to a minor part opposite John Wayne in The Snoods ! ' ( 1976 ) . As the " fastest slowpoke in the West , " he also starred in such classics as Broken Arrow , Cheyenne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brennan , often cast as his tobacco-chewing sidekick , once remarked , " Jimmy Stewart 's not one of your rootin ' - tootin ' , quick-draw cowpokes . Jimmy may look like he 's dawdlin'along , but it ai n't so . He 's really one smart hombre . And straight as a hitching post ! " " In many ways , westerns are the most legitimate and colorfully dramatic tales of Americana , " Stewart says . Then he adds , " I loved making them . " Stewart turns away from the painting of his horse and walks to a couch near a wall of bookshelves . " Well , I guess we can sit here . I call this ' my spot , ' " he says . Behind him on the bookshelf is a statue of an elephant . " Nice to have something conservative around , " he says with a sly grin . Stewart is a staunch conservative Republican and a close friend of Ronald Reagan 's . Asked why he never ran for president , Stewart replies , " I ca n't talk fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the couch , hands folded in his lap . His fingers are long and delicate , better suited for portraying a pianist than playing a western sheriff drawing a six-gun for a shootout . I ask whether his favorite movie was a western . " No , a comedy , " he replies . " It 's a Wonderful Life , that was my favorite . I liked it because the story was n't from a book , or a play , or a true happening , or a script developed by writers . It came from two sentences in letters that the director , Frank Capra , received from a friend . One of the letters had a p.s. that said , ' Just remember , no man is born a failure . ' Later , another letter carried this p.s. : ' Nobody 's poor who has friends . ' The movie evolved from those phrases , and it fascinated me . The whole cast and crew had the feel of being creative . It was very exciting for an actor . " Is there such a thing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . " Are you ? " I do n't . . . think so . " Stewart responds slowly . " I mean , acting does n't come easy to me . I 've always had great respect for it , because you can never sit back and say , well , ' I 've got it made and I can play anything . ' You 're always learning . " Is acting fun ? " Sure , it 's fun . Anything that 's your life 's work has got to be fun , for you and the audience . " Who has been the greatest influence on your acting career ? " Josh Logan , " Stewart says without hesitation . " Without him I would n't even be an actor . He was completely responsible for getting me into acting . " Stewart leans forward , his elbows on his knees . " It was at Princeton , and I can remember exactly where it was on campus when Logan told me about the University Players . 1 can remember as if it happened just the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAITLAND STEWART was born in the improbably named town of Indiana , Pennsylvania , on May 20 , 1908 . His father , Alexander Stewart , ran a hardware store , and when customers did n't have enough money to pay their bills , he 'd accept something in barter . One day a downon-its-luck carnival troupe came in and paid with an accordion . " I just started fooling around with that accordion , " Stewart remembers . " Every note does n't have to be exact . You 're able to fake a lot on an accordion . " Stewart took his accordion along when he attended Princeton as an architecture major . Still interested in performing , he joined the school 's prestigious acting organization , the Triangle Club . He performed in several plays written and directed by his classmate Josh Logan . Logan remembers that Stewart " genuinely liked being on stage , but it took him a long time to admit it . I finally asked him if he had ever thought about becoming an actor . ' Good God , no ! ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' Well , he not only got a B.A. when he graduated , but an A.B. ? Acting Bug . " " I had n't seriously considered being an actor , " Stewart recalls , " even up to that day I walked across campus en route to get my degree in architecture . I figured I 'd go home in the summer and work in my father 's hardware store , then go back to school and get my master 's degree . That 's when I ran into Josh . I suppose it was the most important moment in my life . " Logan told Stewart about the University Players , a group of unknown young actors , including Henry Fonda and Margaret Sullavan , who tried out Broadway-bound plays in a smalltheater in Falmouth , Massachusetts . Logan , directing the group , asked Stewart , " Why do n't you come up to the theater for a few weeks this summer , bring your accordion , and play in the tearoom ? " Stewart figured it would be a good idea , and he went . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stewart says with a shrug . " The people said my playing upset their appetites . " Stewart hung around sweeping floors and working on props and sets until Logan finally gave him a bit part in a play . One he appeared in that summer , Goodbye Again , soon moved to New York . The young student-actor-architect later joined it on Broadway . " I was onstage for only a few minutes in the first act , " Stewart remembers , " but I always came out for the curtain call . I could hear the audience whisper , ' Who 's that ? ' " Stewart decided to stay in New York , and after floundering from job to job , he landed a good part in the drama Yellow Jack , which put his name up in lights for the first time . Shortly after that success , he was offered a contract by MGM Studios . MGM did n't know what to do with the lanky , 130-pound actor when he arrived at the studio in 1935 . " He 's a human giraffe ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gangly actor in comedies playing dull and dependable " other men " who always lost the girl . In one such film , Wife vs . Secretary ( 1936 ) , he played opposite the blonde bombshell Jean Harlow . " Harlow was a great kisser ! " Stewart remembers enthusiastically . " We had to do a romantic scene in the movie , and I 'd never been kissed that way before in my whole life . I mean , boy , when Harlow kissed you , she kissed you . Well .. ah . . . you see , we had to do the scene over and over , and by the time it was filmed , I was a very exhausted young actor . " Then came the breakthrough movie ? Mr. Smith Goes to Washington . Suddenly , the studio realized exactly what image Jimmy Stewart projected to audiences  --  a decent guy , an average fellow , the epitome of the honest , ideal American . Stewart 's skyrocketing career was interrupted by the Second World War , and he entered the army . Sent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying 20 combat missions over Germany . He is too modest to talk about his war exploits . " The war was just something everyone did , " he says . He returned a full colonel with a chestful of medals , including the Distinguished Flying Cross . ( He was promoted to brigadier general in the reserves in 1959 , and he retired in 1968 . ) He resumed his movie career in 1945 and continued to land parts opposite the glamorous women : Marlene Dietrich ? " an absolutely stunning woman " ? Lana Turner , Ginger Rogers , Paulette Goddard , and Olivia de Havilland . Although Stewart dated many of his costars , he remained the most eligible bachelor in Hollywood until 1949 . At age 41 , he met and married Gloria McLean and became stepfather to her two children , Ronald and Michael . Two years later Gloria gave birth to twin girls : Judy and Kelly , The Stewarts ' marriage has lasted almost four decades . Frank Capra once asked Jimmy about the quality of his marriage . " He was silent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he scratched his ear and drawled , ' It 's good . . . darn good . . . I guess it 's that way because Gloria and I really like each other . . . and we 're not afraid to show it . ' " I ask one last question : In 100 years , how would you like James Stewart to be remembered ? He pauses for a long time : " I . . well . . . I 've never been asked that before . I guess I really do n't know . " He thinks for a moment and then says , " People come up to me  --  it 's happened so many times  --  and they say , ' I remember something you did in a movie ... ' and they ca n't remember what the picture was about , or when they saw it , or even its title . What they remember is something that happened , something that moved them . Maybe it was just a look or a word , an action , a tiny piece of time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just . . . I just want to know I 've given people a small piece of time they 'll never forget . " He is silent and I look at him hard , thinking of the legend he is , and I remember what Bette Davis said two years ago : " There are four remaining superstars : myself , Cagney who died in 1986 , Hepburn , and  --  Jimmy Stewart . " Then she added , " And he 's the nicest . " A few minutes later Stewart opens the front door of his home for me . As I step out , another van skids to a halt in front of the house , and the fans wave wildly . 1 turn and look back at Stewart and he is smiling  --  and waving
