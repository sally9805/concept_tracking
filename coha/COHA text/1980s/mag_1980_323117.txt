The Met seeks $100 million <P> Financially speaking , most U.S. opera companies-like most U.S. arts institutions of any kind-are built on a sort of San Andreas fault . Each year they can expect some crevasse to open up between income and expenses . This gap can be filled in on a year-to-year basis through contributions . But for shoring up the foundation over a longer period , there is nothing like an endowment : a large chunk of money tucked away in solid investments . The annual income from the investments ( nowadays from 8% to 10% ) cushions deficits , while the principal provides a hedge against inflation and a bulwark against various disasters . <P> As a last resort , an endowment can be dipped into when there is no other way to stay in business . The Lyric Opera of Chicago has had to use its fund in just this way , draining it from $2 million to a current $3,500 . The San Francisco Opera , on the other hand , is able to plow half the income from its $5 million fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opera , whose $43 million annual budget is four times as large as that of any other U.S. company , has a relatively paltry endowment of $2.2 million . In a press conference last week , Met President Frank Taplin and Executive Director Anthony Bliss announced plans to remedy that situation in a big way . By its 100th anniversary season in 1983-84 , they said , the Met aims to raise its endowment to $100 million . Its nationwide campaign has already gathered $33 million in pledges , including a single gift of $5 million from the Texaco Philanthropic Foundation . <P> Among other things , the endowment will enable the Met to make improvements to its building and stage , to be freer in scheduling worthwhile productions with doubtful box-office appeal and to expand programs like its cultivation of young singers . With the additional money going into such projects , Bliss pointed out , there will be no letup in the need for annual contributions to offset regular operating deficits . Those contributions now total $14.6 million and will almost certainly have to go higher in future seasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undercut the annual fund raising ? Bliss said no , predicting instead that it would foster greater interest and confidence in the Met . " Over the years there have been times when we did n't think we could afford to open our doors or meet our payroll , " he said . " This endowment will ensure our institutional independence and long-range stability . "
