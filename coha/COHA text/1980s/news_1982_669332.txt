There are fascinating hints that it might be . Of course the hints could just as easily be a propaganda ' ' peace offensive ' ' orchestrated in Moscow to protect the Soviet Union during the shakedown phase of the post-Brezhnev era. // During the past week there have been hints or signs or tentative moves in each of the four areas where Soviet action has caused nearly a decade of serious tension between East and West. // This ' ' second cold war ' ' phase dates from the deployment of some 20 , 000 Cuban troops into Angola by Soviet air and sea lift in 1975 when Gerald Ford was President of the United States , Henry Kissinger was secretary of state , and Mr. Kissinger pleaded in vain with the Congress for a vigorous American response. // A Soviet forward foreign policy spread from Angola into Mozambique , Ethiopia , and southern Yemen . Today there are Cuban troops and Soviet ' ' advisers ' ' in Angola , the Congo , Ethiopia , Mozambique , South Yemen , Nicaragua , and Grenada. // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildup of Soviet weapons . The forward movement reached its adventurous climax with the invasion of Afghanistan in December of 1979 . In Western eyes it continued with the imposition of martial law in Poland a year ago . In Soviet eyes this was a defensive move , but whatever the motive , the deed refueled in the West a sense of Soviet menace. // These four events - the Soviet arms buildup , deployment of Cuban troops in Angola , the invasion of Afghanistan , and the suppression of incipient political freedom in Poland - highlighted the phase we might call ' ' the second cold war. ' ' // If Moscow were to cease and desist or perhaps just temper its behavior in these four areas - the world would be a quieter and safer place for all its inhabitants. // Might it happen ? Consider the events of the past week. // The President of the US has confirmed reports that the Soviets have signaled their intention to make a new offer in respect to nuclear weapons in the European theater . They have let it be known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cruise missiles in Europe , they in return would cut down their intermediate range force from a present level of more than 600 to 250 , of which 150 would be targeted on Western Europe and the other 100 on China. // Washington was quick to say this would not be good enough , which is the routine response in diplomatic negotiation to an opening move by the other side . But the fact remains that the Soviets have made an opening move that modifies their previous position and calls for a response from Washington . Said response is now being argued out in the back rooms there. // The important point is that a real negotiation about limiting those Soviet weapons which most worry Europe has begun . And there are accompanying signs that Moscow is interested in talking about the bigger intercontinental strategic weapons with the US. // During this same week of much talk about weapons control came an actual announcement in Poland of a modification of martial law . Again , what was announced is not good enough for Washington . The President wants the Polish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solidarity as a precondition for lifting US sanctions against Poland . The revival of Solidarity is not in the cards. // But the severity of martial law has been tempered , and will be further tempered to a point where the NATO allies in Europe will be resuming normal relations with Poland regardless of what Washington may do or not do. // Nothing firm has happened yet about Afghanistan . But there continue to be hints from Moscow and from other Soviet-bloc countries that the new Soviet head man , Yuri Andropov , would like to find a way to get his troops out of Afghanistan and put an end to the drain on Soviet resources of the guerrilla war there , which is about to enter its fourth year . Afghanistan has become Moscow ' s Vietnam . Is there any way out ? // Angola is a more active story. // Chester Crocker , US assistant secretary of state for Africa affairs , was in Moscow this past week talking to Leonid F. Ilyichev , Soviet deputy foreign minister , about Angola and Namibia . On the same day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Defense Minister Magnus Malan - met with representatives of the Angola government in the Cape Verde Islands . Add that Mr. Crocker ' s deputy , Frank Wisner , has been several times recently in Luanda talking to Angola leaders. // The purpose of all this activity among diplomats is to work out an arrangement under which Cuban troops would leave Angola , or at least be reduced in numbers . In return , South Africa would grant independence to Namibia and cease its military sorties into Angola. // Would Moscow go along with such a deal ? If Moscow did agree , and if the Cuban troop presence in Angola is reduced or eliminated - well , that would reduce or remove the original cause of ' ' the second cold war. ' ' // So , we have serious negotiations looking to a removal of Cuban troops from Angola , the beginnings of serious talk about nuclear weapons limits and controls , and abatement of the severity of martial law in Poland . That reduces tensions in three of the four main areas of the ' ' second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only hints , of Soviet weariness with the costs of attempting to repress dissent in Afghanistan. // The net of it is that the Soviet posture is defensive , rather than aggressive . One would expect that at the beginning of a new Soviet regime . It may last only until Mr. Andropov consolidates his position in the Kremlin - if he does. // But then , if one wants to indulge in optimism , it could be noted that the Soviets may be learning in Afghanistan the same lesson the US learned in Vietnam . There are limits on military power . . . and costs. // Moscow ' s expansionism of the past eight years was built on military power . How much of the position it has gained in the world from that military power will endure ? If the Soviets , too , have learned something about the limits of power - the immediate future might be something better than just a short-term truce. // //
