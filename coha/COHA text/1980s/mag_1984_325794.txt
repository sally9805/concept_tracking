A few close friends gathered round when the awful impact of Edwin Thomas ' $15,000 loan to Ursula Meese began to sink in . " I blew it , " Ed Meese kept repeating in a low tone . " I completely forgot about it . " At one point , when her husband left the room to make a phone call , Ursula broke down and wept . Never before had the friends seen Ursula Meese cry . " I 've done this to him , " she sobbed , " and he does n't deserve it . " <P> The scene poignantly etched Meese 's troubles as he seeks confirmation as Attorney General . In his early days in the White House , Meese was the confident , unshakable " deputy President . " Supervising both the National Security Council staff and that of its domestic equivalent , the Office of Policy Development , he was one of a handful of aides who could walk into the Oval Office without an appointment .

But he was still Reagan 's closest ideological soul mate , valued for his unswerving loyalty and his ability to reflect the President 's political instincts . <P> Friends say Meese 's dream was to be Attorney General , and when William French Smith stepped aside , Reagan was quick to oblige . Meese 's legal qualifications were hardly overwhelming : a 1958 graduate of the University of California Law School at Berkeley , he spent eight years as deputy district attorney for Alameda County , Calif. ; worked briefly as a button-down attorney in private industry ; and from 1978 to 1980 taught criminal law at the University of San Diego Law School .

" He was trying to live up to the Joneses , and the Joneses felt sorry for him , " says one , referring to the loans Meese got from friends . Even so , Meese 's dream of being Attorney General is clearly on hold . " I see a hurt in his eyes , " says his old friend Republican Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada . " He seems bewildered .
