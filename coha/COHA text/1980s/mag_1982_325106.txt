Of baseball 's teams on a roll , Atlanta is the hottest <P> Casey Stengel , the New York Mets ' first manager and " perfesser , " once celebrated a two-game winning streak by donning a high silk hat and taking a carriage ride around Central Park . So streaks are relative . Which is more remarkable-that by the start of last weekend the Chicago White Sox had won eight games in a row or that the Baltimore Orioles had lost nine games in a row ? That the Detroit Tigers took seven straight or that the Milwaukee Brewers dropped five straight ? What 's going on in baseball this season ? <P> The San Diego Padres have actually won nine consecutive games . In the 14 years of the franchise , not once , not at any point , not in any season-never-has San Diego been so much as nine games over .500 . Suddenly the Padres are winning games nine at a time . In making the most of their jubilation , the Padres infuriated the Los Angeles Dodgers , who at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baker thought the San Diego hand-slapping ( high fives , low fives ) a little elaborate for April , and the teams waged a brief beanball war over this point of etiquette . When the dust settled , Los Angeles Manager Tommy Lasorda concluded that the entire affair was just something " prefabricated " by the media . <P> Managers ' imaginations often come into play during streaks . Throughout the St. Louis Cardinals ' eleven-game winning streak , Whitey Herzog 's key strategy was to have Reserve Outfielder Dane lorg deliver the lineup card to the umpires . Meanwhile , Earl Weaver was tossing the Oriole clubhouse looking for his own lucky messenger to end the drought . ( " Has Elrod Hendricks been out there yet ? " Weaver moaned last week . ) <P> But of all the streaks , the most surprising and exhilarating was Atlanta 's . With their same old team and the Mets ' old manager , Joe Torre , the Braves won their first 13 games of the season , two more than the modern major league record set by the Oakland A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's aggressiveness , " Catcher Bruce Benedict says . " It 's pitching , " says First Baseman Chris Chambliss . However , a lot of people think it 's Torre . <P> In the year of Joe DiMaggio 's 56-game hitting streak , DiMaggio had a hit in every spring-training game . The principle was not lost on Torre , who wanted to win in Florida and acquaint the team with the sensation early . The Braves won twelve of their first 14 spring games , and now the players do not seem as amazed as the fans , who are flabbergasted . " I 've never seen so much enthusiasm , " Torre says . " And I was at the World Series with the ' 69 Mets , the team of destiny and all that . " <P> Almost since the day it made off with Milwaukee 's franchise in 1966 , Atlanta has been one of the depressed areas of the major leagues . Though the first season brought out a million and a half customers , attendance had fallen to 534,672 by 1975 . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride ostriches and push baseballs ( with his nose ) around the base paths .
