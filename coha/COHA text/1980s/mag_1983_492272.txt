The antismoking movement , that dedicated gang of activists determined to clean up the indoor air and also to persuade people to quit smoking , is having a profound and even fascinating effect on the nation 's business . Personnel directors , learning that an employee who smokes can cost a firm up to $4,500 a year , are having second thoughts about hiring smokers or allowing smoking on the job . Managers reflect on this question when an employee wins a cash settlement , successfully litigating a claim of damaged health stemming from working in a smoke-ridden environment . High-level executives ponder the news that 34 million people have quit smoking , and that only one-third of the adults in the United States now smoke . The business community 's reaction shows up in the help-wanted ads specifying that " only nonsmokers need apply . " Radar-Electric Inc. of Seattle hands applicants a form with " Do You Smoke ? " written in red ink at the top . If the answer is " Yes , " applicants are told to forget about filling in the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restricted smoking on their premises . Big corporations such as Mobil Oil , Sears , Johns-Manville , Xerox , the Bank of California , and Travelers Insurance took the lead in this category , ruffling some employees ' feelings in the process . Similarly , federal workers must now abide by smoking-zone regula tions . A number of states have passed comprehensive bills affirming nonsmokers ' rights , and some states greatly restrict smoking in public buildings . Minnesota 's " Clean Indoor Air Act " requires no-smoking areas in all buildings open to the general public . Bars and tobacco stores are excepted . The national trend is clearly for greater expanses of no-smoking areas in our public life . The residue of smoking costs big bucks in cleaning , maintenance , repair and replacement . The financial penalty in lowered productivity , absenteeism and health , disability and death benefits makes any corporate or government bottom-line specialist become a potential convert to the no-smoking cause . Interestingly enough , some businessmen are seeing the marketing value of providing a smoke-free environment to their customers . When Lamar Muse started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gimmick to set Muse off from all the other airlines competing for Texas travelers . Aware that the smoking section on any plane has shrunk in recent years , Muse , a 30-year veteran of the business , announced that his new airline would be strictly " no smoking . " Results ? Muse got considerable publicity , has a seatload factor quite good for a newcomer and is making money . Thrifty-Rent-A-Car , the nation 's fifth largest in this field , designated 12 percent of its fleet as no smoking in late 1982 and reports " extremely good results . " Thrifty received many letters from grateful nonsmokers and inquiries from two other big car-rental companies who are considering putting a part of continued on following page 32 their fleets into the no-smoking category . Hotel operators , who are traditionally willing to cater to the whims and variety of lifestyles of their guests , are now setting aside entire floors for clients who want a smoke-free environment . Many hostelries , including the luxurious sort in the Hyatt Regency , Radisson and Four Seasons chains , provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is one motel operator bold enough to designate his entire establishment as no smoking : The " Non-Smokers Inn " in Dallas . The entrepreneuers who felt the first pressure of the no-smoking movement are restaurant and cafeteria owners . For many diners there is nothing more obnoxious than smoke drifting into the nostrils and mouth while enjoying a meal . Many restaurant operators have responded to the complaints by nonsmokers , and have tried to set aside nonsmoking sections and in some instances have even made sure that their establishments are entirely unpolluted by any pernicious smoke fumes . There is no official count available on the number of such dining places , but they 're increasing at a rapid rate . As the nonsmoking movement spread throughout this country during the ' 70s , so did " networking , " the practice of exchanging information and advice among any group of people who have a common interest . The pioneer organization ASH ( Action on Smoking on Health ) became the focal point for the litigation , lobbying and the public-information activity of the budding movement . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , founded and run by Lamar Muse and his son , Michael , which has assumed the chore of coordinating the efforts to provide complete travel arrangements specifically designed for nonsmoking customers . Muse operates out of Dallas , Houston , Midland/Odessa , Tulsa and Los Angeles . So the Muses , father and son , came up with the idea of offering nonsmoking travelers in these markets not only the smoke-free ride in one of their DC Super-80s , but smoke-free Thrifty-Rent-A-Cars and lodgings in nine hotels and motels providing a smokeless environment . So now travel agents have one more " package " to sell  --  this one for nonsmokers . Lamar Muse , 62 , is known as a willful , flamboyant and successful airline executive . Years ago , he was the principal figure in launching Southwest Airlines in Texas . Yet his vigorous manner of giving orders got him into trouble with Southwest 's board , and Muse was surprised when they accepted his resignation as president in 1978 . He was 58 then and had 30 years in the airline business , but felt too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his contract with Southwest expired , freeing him to start another airline . He named it after himself . Muse Airlines was up , up and away on July 15 , 1981 . Its target of competitive opportunity ? Naturally , Southwest . But Muse Airlines needed an emblem to make it stand out . " We were competing with an airline that Lamar had made famous , " explains Edward W. Lang , Muse vice president , " so we needed something to set us apart , something they could n't match , something to get us a lot of press and publicity . " July/Aug. ' 83 Lamar Muse , who had just quit smoking after 40 years , made the bold announcement that his would be the first nonsmoking airline . He also began issuing statements as to why he quit smoking . " I started feeling as though there was an elephant on my chest , " he said of his addiction to cigarettes . He added the reflective observation that his first wife , Jaunice , " smoked those darn Camel cigarettes until the day she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to people 's consciences , as well . " We know that there are a few confirmed smokers , who , even though they spend an hour in church every Sunday without smoking , will ride the competition 's plane on the 50-minute flight between Dallas and Houston because we prohibit their smoking , " he proclaimed the day when his airline was launched . There are cynics in Dallas who claim that Lamar Muse , who once flipped cigarette butts onto his lawn or anywhere else every five minutes , had trained himself to stop smoking just so he could have a gimmick for his new airline . Muse swears this is n't true , but admits that his no-smoking edict for his airline was " purely a marketing decision . " This country has changed , " he says . " Our surveys indicated that 9 out of 10 airline passengers prefer nonsmoking . " Still , son Michael , 33 , a lifelong nonsmoker , was n't sure that the smoking ban would work and worried that smokers would shun the new airline , leaving it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " recalled Lamar , who made himself chief executive officer to Michael 's mere presidency . " I just said , ' that 's the way we 're going to do it . ' " Muse the elder reasoned that since their airline 's principal trips were 50 minutes , only 30 to 40 of which could be used as smoking time , smokers would n't mind the relatively brief abstinence period . To keep smokers happy , Muse gave them " Smoker 's Survival Kits , " little packets containing a puzzle , chewing gum , candy , and a form offering " heavy smokers " a free return trip if they sign their names after this statement : " Sorry , I thought I could make it without smoking , but I could n't . " Very few passengers have sent in the form . According to Edward Lang , the overwhelming majority of responses to the smoking ban have been enthusiastic approval . " My wife is a chain smoker , " a California man wrote . " She felt the excellent service and friendly personnel made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she might start chewing tobacco as an alternative . " Another passenger made it short : " I 'll fly Muse when I can because you do n't allow smoking . " One passenger , " a confirmed smoker , " expressed " great fears that I may not be able to sustain myself , " but said the congenial crew and clean airplane made him decide to fly Muse again . Yet another letter was signed by 20 people expressing appreciation for the no-smoking policy and saying " We love you . " Lang says proof of loyalty to Muse is the fact that , at certain times during the day , Southwest has Dallas-Houston flights every 15 minutes , while there is one every hour by Muse , and yet Muse passengers will wait . " If people miss our 8:00 a.m. flight , " Lang says , " the next one is 9:00 a.m . They could catch two or even three Southwest flights before 9:00 , but they stick with us . " Lang says Muse 's load factor is 58 percent , just four points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dallas-Los Angeles run , the old doubts surfaced again . Asking smokers to hold off for 30 to 40 minutes is one thing , but could they sit still for the three-hour flight to the West Coast ? " I called on 13 travel agencies to convince myself , " says Lang . " All but one told me not to have Muse go back to smoking . They said we had built a loyal base of customers . " Muse can rightly claim that its planes are the best smelling ; air-filters have to be cleaned once every six months instead of every six weeks ; and crew members ' absenteeism and sick leave costs are less than airlines that permit smoking // Although Lang claims " Muse is not part of the antismoking movement , " the airline has joined promotions by the American Cancer Society ( " The Great American Smokeout " ) and the American Heart Association ( making donations to AHA for each round-trip ticket purchase ) . The no-smoking rule on Muse presents occasional problems . Some smokers repair to the restrooms and puff away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because lavatories are quite vulnerable to catching fire and airplanes on fire are deathtraps . Muse trains its flight attendants to be especially attentive to this potential , and it has installed smoke alarms in the lavatories . And while Muse got an enormous amount of publicity for its no-smoking policy and its alliances with the American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association , there is no ban on smoking in Muse Airlines offices or for that matter in the cockpit of Muse planes . " Pilots can smoke while flying , " Lang admits . " They have to keep the door closed , of course . I guess 30 to 40 percent of our pilots are smokers . " Still , Muse flight attendants go up and down the aisle , tending to passengers ' comforts , even thanking them for flying with Muse . " One passenger replied , ' I had no choice , ' " says Lang . " He was a prisoner being taken to Texas . The security officer told him his sentence would start on the flight because this prisoner was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22,000 cars as no smoking and offers them in 60 cities . " The response has been tremendous , " says Douglas E. Harrison , Thrifty 's vice president of operations . " These cars just smell fresh and clean , and that 's why people ask for them . " " Thank You for Not Smoking " signs , as well as the international symbol showing that smoking is banned , are placed on the doors , dashboards , ashtrays and trunk decks of these cars . " We researched the marketability of no-smoking cars , " says Harrison , " and concluded this alternative made good business sense . The majority of people today are nonsmokers . " We save on cleaning costs from not having to repair burns on the carpets and the seats . Smoke film does n't build up on the windows . And when we go to sell the car , we do better than we do with other cars because the no-smoking cars do n't have that used smell . " It 's a matter of relying on people 's integrity when you ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach down for the ashtray , they 'll discover it 's full of mints . We think the smokers who rent nonsmoking cars and are tempted can be pacified by these mints . " Harrison reports an " extremely good response " from customers using the no-smoking cars , and says two other major car-rental companies have asked Thrifty how this innovation works . When a guest registers at Lyndon Sanders ' " Non-Smokers Inn " on the Carpenter Freeway in Dallas-West , he or she must sign a " Nonsmoking Agreement , " all in red letters . The agreement specifies that the guest , any person " in my party " or " any guest of mine " will not smoke in the room rented . If that agreement is violated , the guest must pay $100 in " cleaning and detoxification charges , " and if a suit is filed for violation , the guest must agree to pay " reasonable " attorney 's fees and incidental expenses that the inn incurs . This is a rather tough prohibition , but it has n't kept people away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an absolute ban on smoking anywhere on the premises . Moreover , if a guest is caught smoking and insists on continuing , he or she can expect to be evicted from the premises . That 's how determined Sanders is . Perhaps a half-dozen of the 65,000 guests who have stayed at the inn since it opened in March 1982 were involved in smoking , and each time it caused a ruckus akin to that at the Ivory Soap company the day one of the " It Floats " bars sank in the company swimming pool . " One of them was a doper , " says Sanders , 54 . " He left his dope paraphernalia , which we confiscated along with his other personal effects . He never returned to claimthese things . " Two other instances involved a guest 's visitor who reached in from habit and lit a cigarette . The guest flushed it down the commode immediately , and called us . We made an inspection and used a deodorant . The guest agreed we could inspect the room on checkout , and if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid for super-cleaning . We inspected , and there was no trace . " Sanders ' associate is Wandra Hodges , 45 , a militant antismoker , married to a smoker for 25 years before she divorced him . " 1 collected once from two young men who got right in the room and let their guests come in and smoke , " she said . " We could n't rent that room for two weeks . We fumigated and super-cleaned it , and still , a guest came in one month after that and said she could smell the smoke . She was super-sensitive , so we moved her to another room . " When Sanders was a youth he smoked , but soon came to hate it with a passion . After a career as a teacher in the ' 50s , he finally settled into the motel business . Recalling nights in rooms smelling of smoke residue , including one bad night in Kansas City where " my pillow reeked of smoke , " Sanders determined to put his antismoking conviction into practice . On March 15 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Alamo to this Texan , Sanders opened a 15-room section of his Dollar Inn in Albuquerque , New Mexico . The section soon recorded the highest occupancy rate in the motel and was expanded to cover half the rooms in the 218-unit inn . " We had guards patrolling the inn in Albuquerque , " says Wandra Hodges , " and they had German shepherds with them . if a guest smoked in a no-smoking room and made trouble , the dogs would be a help . If the smoker still did n't cooperate , we would call the police . " Actually , troublesome situations at either of Sanders ' inns are rare . He makes the plausible claim that nonsmokers are better behaved as guests . " They are more thoughtful than smokers , " he says . " We have never had to call the police for drunkenness , theft or other type problems at Non-Smokers Inn . " Sanders claims that operating costs at his Dallas inn are 30 percent less than they arc in a conventional motel because of savings in cleaning , replacement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be marred by burns . This saving , he says , makes it possible for the Non-Smokers Inn to offer rates ranging from $32 to $56 a night ( Governor 's Unit ) , somewhat lower than those of motels with comparable facilities . The inn 's rooms are quite nice and verge on being luxurious . They have two touchtone phones ( one in the bath ) , color TV ( on cable ) , an FM radio , comfortable , large beds , a free health spa and swimming pool and complimentary coffee or tea in the morning . The security is quite good . A magnetic card opens the room door . There are guards inside and out , according to Wandra Hodges . And of course , the danger of fire is minimal since a major cause of fire  --  smoking  --  is monitored by special smoke detectors in each room . If nonsmokers are better behaved and more productive , as no-smoking advocates believe , then the NonSmokers inn personnel should be a cut above the run of motel employees . Why ? Because Wandra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all new employees sign an agreement stating : " I do not smoke and I will not smoke . Further , in the event I have been around those who do smoke for any reason , and it is noticeable , I will change my clothes , bathe and shampoo my hair , if necessary . 1 further agree , should I smoke , 1 will tender my resignation immediately . " " Even to get an interview for a job , the applicant must tell me that he or she has n't smoked in six months , " Wandra says . " We had a husband-and-wife team here once as managers , and they were not crusaders . It did n't work out . She had smoked just before they came here . " Wandra paused and said , in lament , " It just did n't work out . " The inn was a bit of a curiosity when it was being built and during the first year of operation . Sanders had announced that his motivation in opening it was that he mourned the loss of several people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , by smoking . " It kills 1,000 Americans every day , " he said of tobacco smoke . Still , he got nuisance phone calls from people telling him he was " dumb " to open a nonsmoker 's inn . Then there was the subcontractor at the construction site who , on learning what the motel was all about , said , " Oh yeah ? Well , I 'll light one up right now . " He did , and blew the smoke in Sanders ' face . Building time took longer than expected , according to Wandra Hodges , because of Sanders ' insistence that , once the doors and windows were in place , no worker could smoke on the job . " We told them they had to leave their cigarettes in the car or at home , " she explained . " Several times when deliverymen showed up they had cigarettes in their mouths . We had to stop that . Then one guy shows up with three long cigarettes in his mouth . But they were n't lit . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and empty their ashtrays onto our driveway and then hurry away . Once a lady came in here smoking , and I stopped her at the door , looked her in the eye and said , ' You ca n't bring that cigarette in here ! ' She went out to the gutter and stomped it out . " But Sanders and Wandra have their outgoing sides , too , and it is expressed in their practice of giving free donuts to people who work for the airlines and rental agencies in hopes they will refer nonsmokers to the inn . The monthly donut bill is $1,400 , and Sanders regards it as a good investment . The Non-Smokers Inn managed to turn a profit in its first year . The average occupancy rate of Dallas hotels , Wandra says , runs between 60 and 68 percent . According to Wandra , the Non-Smokers Inn is running 74 percent , and the number is rising . She and Sanders will not rent rooms to smokers . They love to mouth and print these antitobacco aphorisms : 1 . Smoking is colorful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone who smokes is like licking out of a dirty old ashtray . 3 . Cancer cures smoking . Wandra admits there are moments at the inn , however , when it 's tough to make a decision . " Two men came here chewing cigars , " she said . " We let them in as guests , and I am sure they did n't smoke . But they sure chewed a lot . "
