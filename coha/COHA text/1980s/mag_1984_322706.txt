For returning vets , Normandy brings a crosscurrent of emotions <P> On the Atlantic coast of France , just above the pointing finger of Brittany , Normandy juts out like a green thumb into the blue-gray waters of the English Channel . At this time of year , the lush countryside is lit up with apple , pear and cherry blossoms . Along narrow country lanes , lilacs bloom around stone farmhouses and over ancient walls . Cowslips , daisies and bluets ripple through the wet pastures , interrupted regularly by thick hedgerows . Once again the surging Norman spring is laying down a floral carpet over the old killing ground . <P> For the Normandy veterans who come back for the first time , the experience often brings a bewildering rush of emotional crosscurrents : nostalgia for the pride and purpose they felt as young soldiers mixed with something akin to guilt for having survived when death randomly took so many friends . At Omaha Beach , where the water 's edge turned red from American blood , returning veterans remember the deafening roar of battle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the lap of a low surf , the keening of seagulls and occasionally the shouts of children playing on the beach . The puzzle is how to connect the remembered knot of constant fear , the moments of horror and exhilaration in combat , with the tranquil landscape beyond the beach . It is a vision by Edvard Munch imposed on a romantic painting from la Belle Epoque . Some of the veterans , now mainly in their 60s , simply sit down on the beach and stare out to sea . For others , the contrast between recollection and reality , that old trick of time , brings tears to the eyes . <P> Samuel Fuller , 71 , a film director and screenwriter who lives in Los Angeles , was 31 when he hit Omaha Beach as a corporal with the 3rd Battalion , 16th Regiment of the 1st Infantry Division , the Big Red One . A small , intense man with a cigar perpetually in his mouth , Fuller returned this month for the first time and felt a little lost . He could not find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cliffs beyond the beach . The tall tree on the heights designated before the landing as an assembly point was missing . In a surprised , almost wounded tone , Fuller noted , " All the wreckage is gone . " It was hard for him to believe that all those destroyed landing craft , tanks and trucks had disappeared . " Look at the parking lot and the vacation houses , " said Fuller . " The place has turned into a resort ! " Still , he was moved by the sight . Hoisting his nine-year-old daughter Samantha onto his shoulders , Fuller moved across the 200 yards of beach to the water line . For a moment he stood there silently , then retraced his steps of 40 years ago with his child , instead of a pack , on his back .
