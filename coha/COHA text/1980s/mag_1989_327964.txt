In 1939 a musical called The Straw Hat Revue opened at Manhattan 's Ambassador Theater . The show , which cost $8,000 to put on Broadway , featured such future stars as Danny Kaye , Imogene Coca , Alfred Drake and a young dancer named Jerome Robbins . This week  --  50 years later and four blocks south , at the Imperial Theater  --  Broadway welcomes another revue , Jerome Robbins ' Broadway , with another cast of young hopefuls . But everything else about this show is bigger , riskier and very late ' 80s . For one thing , its co-sponsor is a Japanese liquor firm . For another , it carries an all-time-high ticket price of $55 . And the cost of its opening is $8 million , a thousand times that of The Straw Hat Revue . <P> These days , that 's show biz . But Jerome Robbins ' Broadway is no ordinary show . It is an unprecedented monument , a living museum that one of Broadway 's great names has erected to himself . The master shaman , now 70 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or choreographed between 1944 and 1964 . The sailors from On the Town again saunter through wartime New York , New York . The royal courtesans of The King and I restage Uncle Tom 's Cabin , Siamese-style . West Side Story 's Sharks and Jets strut toward one more epochal + rumble . The shtetl Jews from Fiddler on the Roof hold true to tradition . <P> With this new show , Robbins is both appealing to Broadway tradition and bucking it . He is a man going up against his own legend  --  as the premier American-born dancemaker , whose works for the ballet and Broadway suavely merged high art with pop culture . Robbins has always been a spellbinding storyteller ; the narrative clarity of each movement instantly draws viewers into the roiling emotional life of his characters . In his comic ballets , visual gags fly past like precision pies in a Keystone caper . This show proves he is back where he belongs , on a street that belongs to him : Jerome Robbins ' Broadway . He has prepared meticulously for this moment : nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks of preview performances . " I was n't just putting shows on the way they were , " he says of this elephantine gestation . " I was redoing them all , putting as much energy and direction into them as I originally did . " The show will need 16 months of sold-out houses to break even , and its backers are audibly apprehensive . " Robbins has an economic interest too , " says co-producer Bernard Jacobs , president of the Shubert Organization , " but artists are very peculiar . Finally , we are all in his hands . " They are also in the hands of the ' 80s Broadway babies , raised on body mikes , synthesizers and musicals with no dance numbers . Will they care about a showman who has n't staged a new show in 25 years ?
