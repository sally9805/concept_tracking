The tall man in the dark double-breasted suit stood ramrod straight while Edward Koch introduced him at a city hall press conference . Then Richard R. Green , freshly appointed chancellor of the New York City school system , biggest ( 939,142 students ) and arguably the baddest in all the land , said to the mayor , " Why do n't you be seated ? " Koch complied , like a schoolboy whom the principal has put in his place . And when His Honor tried later to rise , the Big Apple 's new headmaster froze him with a turn of the hand . <P> That 's how things tend to be when Richard Green , the first black to hold the New York chancellorship , steps forward . Green , 51 , has ruled for the past eight years over the 55-school Minneapolis system , where 40% of the 40,000 students are minority youngsters and where the quality of education had sagged badly through the ' 70s . After first putting in 16 months of planning , Green moved so firmly that in Minneapolis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shut down 18 underused schools , imposed a citywide curriculum and instituted achievement tests for kindergarten through ninth grade . Those who failed were held back , including almost 10,000 kindergartners over five years . Green negotiated millions in corporate gifts to the school system . And he broke segregation patterns with busing , magnet schools and careful ( some thought rigid ) monitoring of racial balance . To halt white flight , he organized tours of a turned-around school for real estate agents . They were impressed . So are education observers , who now rate the system among the nation 's best . Even his critics , who consider him arrogant and closed-minded , are grudgingly admiring . Says Len Biernat , a law professor who ran unsuccessfully for the school board as a Green opponent : " He 's a strong , strong person and can stand up to the heat . " <P> New Yorkers figure he will get plenty of that . Minneapolis is one thing , they snort , New York City is something else . Despite islands of excellence maintained by devoted principals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroys rulers who would grapple with 32 autonomous districts and a $5.2 billion budget that evaporates with few observable results . " The dimensions of the system can be overwhelming , " admits former Chancellor Nathan Quinones , who decided to give up last August . Says a high school teacher : " The three best things about the job are June , July and August . " <P> Consider , as Green must , the realities of the other nine months . Dropout rates approach 90% in some ghetto schools and  --  depending on who is counting  --  30% to 55% citywide . A surfeit of aging buildings crumble in disrepair . Desks occasionally spill out of overcrowded classrooms into hallways prowled by student hoodlums who " have been bringing weapons to school for years , " says one principal . An overpowerful custodian 's union , whose president was killed last year in what police described as a gangland-style rubout , dictates the hours schools will be open . Tenured high school principals can not be fired without interminable hearings . Under a 19-year-old decentralization plan , elementary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters  --  which has resulted in a chaotic absence of accountability . Nevertheless , the central bureaucracy keeps a stranglehold on orders for such bedrock necessities as textbooks and Xerox paper .
