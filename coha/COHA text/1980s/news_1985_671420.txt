But the commander , Gen. Paul F. Gorman , told the Senate Armed Services Committee that support of the rebels should be resumed , along with diplomatic measures , to keep up economic and political pressure and " bring the Sandinistas to a reckoning " // Asked after the hearing how long such pressure would take to produce changes in the Nicaraguan Government , he replied , " Years. " // <> <> Nicaragua Proposes Meeting // General Gorman , who will turn over his command on Saturday , said that while most of Nicaragua ' s neighbors had unofficially told him that they would favor a change in the Sandinista Government , the rebel forces were too small and ill trained to accomplish such an objective. // " I would argue that you build your policy on what ' s possible , " he added later . " I don ' t think overthrow is feasible in the near future. " // In Costa Rica , Reagan Administration officials said , the Government is considering whether to curtail relations with Nicaragua , a development that the officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicaraguan rebels . ( Page A13. ) // <> <> Power Sharing Called Aim // The Administration ' s justification for supporting the rebels has evolved in the past year from blocking arms shipments to neighboring countries , to pressuring Managua to amend its behavior in the region , to seeking a change in the Nicaraguan government. // President Reagan , at a news conference six days ago , said the goal of United States policy was to " remove " the " present structure " of the Nicaraguan Government . The President said he wanted the Sandinistas to " say ' uncle ' " to the rebels and allow them to share power. // General Gorman said today that the rebels had not succeeded in cutting off arms shipments from Managua to Salvadoran guerrilla groups . But he said the civil war in Nicaragua had " drawn off the energies of the Sandinistas and has diverted one heck of a lot of money " that would have gone to underwrite the Salvadoran revolution . " Whatever you were investing in those 16 , 000 fighters , you got more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But as far as actually winning their military struggle , he said , the Nicaraguan rebels are " marginally able to sustain " their troops and can not expect victory " in the foreseeable future . " <> <> Salvador Rebels in Switch // General Gorman said that in El Salvador military gains by the Government had forced a major reversal in the strategy of the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. // He said the United States had obtained copies of " instructions " from rebel leaders in Managua to field commanders to abandon a strategy of fighting the Salvadoran Army in large formations , to break down their formations into smaller units and to return to urban warfare that had been abandoned a few years ago. // As a result , he said , the number of guerrillas in the capital city of San Salvador had grown recently from 50 to 500 , with missions to kill and kidnap Government officials as well as attack economic targets . <> <> Shootings Said to Restart // " The shootings have started again in San Salvador , and in my judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F.M.L.N. decision , " he said , using the initials in Spanish of the rebel group. // In response to a question from Senator Edward M. Kennedy , Democrat of Massachusetts , the general said there was " no reason to believe " that the violence was caused by death squads operating with Government approval. // General Gorman ' s appraisal , given at a three-hour hearing , was the finale of a 22-month assignment as commander of the Southern Command during which he was credited with building the American military operation from a sleepy backwater to a forceful instrument of foreign policy . The general has announced he is retiring , after 40 years ' service , to a farm in Virginia. // His successor , Gen. John R. Galvin , was at the hearing today and said he planned to depart for the command headquarters in Panama on Thursday. // <> <> New Aid Sought for Rebels // General Gorman ' s appearance came as the Administration is pressing Congress to permit $14 million in covert aid to the Nicaraguan rebels . A vote is expected in April or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of United States assistance , which was cut off by Congress last year , the ranks of the rebels had been growing . He put the strength of the several rebel groups at 16 , 000 armed men and said they could field " half again as many fighters in several months " if given financial support. // The main accomplishment of the rebels , he said , has been to drain resources that the Nicaraguan Government would otherwise use to subsidize Salvadoran guerrilla groups. // Praising the Nicaraguan rebels as " freedom fighters " whose goal is to oust the Sandinistas , he said : " I don ' t see any immediate prospect that these guys in blue suits in the hills are going to march into Managua . It seems to me that the whole resistance movement has got another year or more of slogging to go before that were ever in prospect. " // " The answer , " he added , " lies in some kind of combination of pressures and diplomacy. " // <> <> Manuals Again an Issue // Later , General Gorman referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Central Intelligence Agency had supplied the rebels with manuals for guerrilla warfare. // " Most of these folks , as I understand it from talking to the Hondurans and Costa Ricans , are uneducated campesinos , " he said . " Most of them can ' t read . I think the only people that have used the manuals that were produced for them effectively is members of this body. " // Questioned after the hearing , General Gorman said United States aid would not change the prospects for a rebel victory . " I don ' t see how you could imagine that a force of 16 , 000 is going to overthrow a Government that has under its control 10 times that number of people in their army. " // He told the committee that without a renewal of aid to the rebels , " the campaign will begin to peter out , wear down. " // " The nature of the beast is that you join what you think is a winning cause , " he said. // Such a guerrilla reversal would be followed , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into neighboring Honduras that would swell the refugee population there to more than 50 , 000. // The general said that leaders he had talked to in other Central American countries , especially Costa Rica and Honduras , while publicly calling for diplomatic measures , had unofficially said the Nicaraguan Government " must change. " // " The leaders that I have had discussions with on this subject have stated unanimously that they can not deal with a Marxist-Leninst garrison state in their midst . That must change . They will then usually go on to say , ' If that means they must be removed , then so be it. ' " // //
