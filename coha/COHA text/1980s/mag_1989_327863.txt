Historians have long considered the 1908 livestock feeding barn of the Manchester family in New Hampshire , Ohio , to be one of the finest examples of a round barn in the Midwest . That was nice , but until recently , the barn was nearly useless for modern grain farming . Like most old barns , it contained stalls for livestock and horses  --  the preindustrial tractors of agriculture  --  and a cavernous hayloft for storing their fuel . Over time , the outmoded barn weathered and withered . But during the past 15 years , to avoid new construction costs , the Manchesters have braced the old roof , installed modern seed-conditioning machinery inside , applied a coat of white paint and given the barn a new working life . <P> Like the Manchesters ' building , hundreds of old barns across the U.S. have lately been remodeled and put back to work , many of them thanks to a program jointly sponsored by the National Trust for Historic Preservation and Successful Farming magazine . The program 's name : Barn Again ! The sponsors offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of up to $1,000 for the best examples . " But they 're not just stage sets , " says Barn Again ! project director Mary Humstone . " They have to have a living , practical use . " <P> The big buildings blend form and function in a uniquely American design vernacular . " The family farm is a reflection of one of our last great freedoms in America , " says Chester Liebs , director of the University of Vermont 's historic preservation program . " The barn is the rural equivalent of the Statue of Liberty . Each time we see a barn , it is a powerful reminder that our agricultural lands are still in the hands of the many . " Kerry Dawson , professor of landscape architecture at the University of California at Davis , describes barns as " superb building technology , " but adds , " As you look upward , the timbers and rafters are almost cathedral-like . " <P> That sense is enhanced in most barn restorations . " Bigger is the whole concept , " says Michigan renovation expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . Ciolek creates higher , longer open spaces by a process called trussing . First he rearranges the old post-and-beam construction , then transfers the weight of the roof and hayloft to the outside walls by means of triangular wooden supports . Says Illinois livestock farmer Janis King , who had Ciolek fix up an 1870 barn : " Unless lightning strikes , the barn will be here another 100 years . " <P> Renovation is usually cheaper than a new barn , and fixing up a historic structure can earn an investment tax credit as well . Barn Again ! contest winners have spent an average of $11,000 on their projects , compared with a $25,000-to-$35,000 cost for a new metal building . There are exceptions , though : the Taylor family 's handsome horse barn in Orange , Va. , built in 1933 from a Sears , Roebuck mail-order-catalog kit , cost $39,000 to restore to its former efficiency . <P> For some , more heartfelt reasons than money are at stake . When Stockton , Ill. , dairy farmer Stewart Schlafer , 41 , was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear down the family 's 1876 barn and build a new one . Now , age and memories have convinced Schlafer that he should keep and improve his Gothic-style beauty . The barn , he says , " is the character and soul of our farm . "
