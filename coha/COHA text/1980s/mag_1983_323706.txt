How history responds to ideas and yearnings <P> So , little by little , time brings out each several thing into view , and reason raises it up into the shores of light . <P> - Lucretius <P> News , almost by definition , tends in the other direction . <P> Events may be merely busy , of course-a sort of itch of the unusual , a restlessness in the world . But when the news is momentous , it may run toward darker , murkier regions , toward war and catastrophe . <P> Yet , sometimes , the news does rise toward the shores of light . Sometimes history responds not merely to the promptings of blind accident or economic tides but to the pressure of ideas or to a kind of coalescence of yearnings .

The European Jews arrived in Palestine , one writer said , as if they had come to colonize the moon . But the place was not untenanted , and all the history of Israel since its birth has been troubled by a 35-year war that , quite apart from the usual territorial disputes and ethnic antagonisms , has been one of conflicting visions , of Israeli hopes and Palestinian hopes .
