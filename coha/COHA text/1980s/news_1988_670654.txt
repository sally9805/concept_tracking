Five decades later , such is not the case for legislators from the New York City area . With air shuttles in both directions taking off at half-hour intervals all day long , many members of the delegation have developed into commuter Congressmen who regard Washington as a place where they do part-time work. // " People ask me whether I think of myself as living in Washington or New York , " said Representative Gary L. Ackerman , a Queens Democrat who makes as many as three roundtrips a week . " My answer is that I live on the shuttle. " // Representative Floyd H. Flake said he seems to spend " about 95 percent of my time running through the airport to catch planes . " <> <> Trouble in New York , Too // " People think I ' m O. J. Simpson , " said Mr. Flake , who is also a Queens Democrat . But one should not complain , Mr. Flake added . Commuting between New York and Washington is not so different from commuting between Queens and Manhattan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is probably the easier of the two now that the Williamsburg Bridge is out. " // Not all New York legislators are quite that good-natured about the time they pass on the Eastern Air Lines and Pan American shuttles. // Many grumble about delays and worry about safety , particularly in light of labor-management clashes at Eastern and the comprehensive safety inspection of Eastern begun this month by the Federal Aviation Administration. // " Of late , one wonders whether we ' re playing Russian roulette in the sky , " said Representative Ted Weiss , a Democrat of Manhattan and the Bronx . <> <> Moynihan ' s Compensation // Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has said that the only compensation for having to dart between New York and Washington all the time is his conviction that on Judgment Day each flight will be deducted from his sentence in purgatory. // Representative Thomas J. Downey , Democrat of Suffolk , said he had taken a somewhat extreme approach to improving the comfort of his commutes. // " You know how they always let anyone with small children pre-board , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had two children just so I could get on the plane before everybody else. " // Many New York Congressmen said they try to cut down on their time aloft by packing all their Washington work into two or three days in the middle of the week . Even so , they said , when there is an event in their home district on a Wednesday night , their constituents expect them. // " And really they ' re right , " said Mr. Flake . " Washington closes down by about 8 o ' clock at night - all the receptions start and end early - and the last shuttle for New York doesn ' t take off until 9 : 30 . So it ' s hard to say you can ' t make it. " // Representative James H. Scheuer recalled how on one occasion a blizzard prevented him making it home for the wedding of the daughter of one of his supporters . Even so , the supporter " was absolutely furious , " said Mr. Scheuer , a Queens Democrat. // " She slammed the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was obvious that the city was unreachable but that made no difference. " // The legislators admit they have some advantages over non-governmental commuters . For one , their airfare is paid by the taxpayers . For another , they are allowed to park their cars at no charge at the airports . Those who do not want to leave a car can have members of their staff drop them off and pick them up . <> <> Late Votes Cause Chaos // " You should see the scene when we ' re having late votes , " said Hank Roden , an aide to Representative Bill Green , Republican of Manhattan . " There ' ll be half a dozen staffers parked at the bottom of the Capital Hill steps , engines running , noses pointing out , ready to zing their bosses to the airport. " // Peripatetic New York lawmakers also enjoy the benefit of ever-mounting frequent-flyer credits . " I figure when Eastern has its first flight to Saturn , I ' ll get to go free , " said Mr. Downey. // It is Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since he began commuting from the nation ' s political capital to its financial capital 22 years ago. // The Eastern shuttle has been flying since 1961 . Pan Am inaugurated its service in October 1986 . Trains also run between New York and Washington , including Amtrak ' s Metroliner , but most New York Congressmen do not go by rail except in very bad weather. // New York Congressmen avail themselves of both air shuttles . <> <> Aisle Seats Coveted // " My staff prefers me to take Eastern because there are no phones on the Eastern planes , " Mr. Scheuer said . " I take Pan Am and right away I ' m on the phone and on their tails for the whole hour. " // The seats New York Congressmen covet are those on the aisle near the forward exit and the rows that have extra leg room because of their proximity to emergency exits. // Mr. Downey said he once gave a choice aisle seat to Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey . " I consider that to have been a Gandhi-esque gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also expected special consideration from him thereafter for a number of pieces of legislation. " // The delegation seems fairly equally divided between those who like to work on the plane and those who prefer to fly unconscious. // " A half hour of sleep at 25 , 000 feet is the best sleep you can get , " said Mr. Ackerman . Still , he said , the flights can also provide a good opportunity to chat with House colleagues or whatever other interesting passengers happen to be along . <> <> Friendly Chat With Nixon // " A couple of weeks ago Richard Nixon was on the shuttle , " Mr. Ackerman said . " He took three seats , with himself by the window , a body guard on the aisle and the middle seat vacant. // " Everyone knew it was him but nobody talked to him . So finally I went up and said ' Hello , Mr. President . ' And he was immediately very friendly . He wanted to talk . It occurred to me that maybe he left the middle seat vacant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat there and didn ' t talk to him. " // Representative Charles E. Schumer , Democrat of Brooklyn , said that he reads newspapers on the shuttle . " It ' s the only day of the week that I know I can read all four New York newspapers cover-to-cover , " he said. // But Representative Charles B. Rangel , Democrat of Harlem , said he rarely manages to work aloft because on most flights at least one passenger recognizes him and says : " Congressman , this is no place to discuss this - but. " // After nine terms in the House , Mr. Rangel said he had grown so accustomed to dividing his time between the two cities that he could hardly imagine another way of life. // " I would never be secure enough to represent a district in some place like California , " he said . " I ' d always be worried that there ' d be some son-of-a-gun like Rangel back there going after my job. " //               @ @ @ @ @ @
