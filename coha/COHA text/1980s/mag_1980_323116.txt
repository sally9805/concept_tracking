CBS is the first network to jump into cable <P> John Backe may be gone , but his ideas - or at least some of them-are still alive at CBS . Just a week after he resigned as president , the corporation announced that it was going forward with one of his fondest projects : a new cable unit . " Cable is a new development , " explained CBS Chairman William Paley , the man who showed Backe the way to the door marked EXIT . " And there is no reason in the world why we should n't be in it . " <P> Though the details are still sketchy , CBS plans an aggressive campaign to capture part of the rapidly growing cable market . It will not compete with pay TV networks like Time Inc. ' s Home Box Office , but will make its profit by selling the new CBS channel to cable systems around the country and to advertisers . <P> As befits the " Tiffany network , " programming-which will probably not begin for at least a year-will emphasize quality , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , public affairs . An example of the kind of show CBS Cable might offer is Joseph Papp 's upcoming production of The Pirates of Penzance in Central Park , starring Linda Ronstadt . Surprisingly , the new cable unit will carry neither sports nor news but may attempt children 's programming . Backe , 47 , said earlier this month that CBS will soon be " a complete , total communications corporation . " His prediction is apparently accurate . CBS is the first network to venture into cable , an act that frightens some network affiliates , who tend to feel threatened by the growth of cable television . <P> As the aftershocks of Backe 's surprise departure reverberated along Network Row in Manhattan , one thing became clear : Paley , 78 , had been having doubts about his successor for some time . Backe was a fine administrator , Paley believes , but he did not have the vision needed by the head of CBS , which is not just a corporation in the chairman 's view , but a company with a mission to educate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal foundation . Paley , who also got rid of Backe 's predecessor , can not tolerate the idea of anybody taking his place - ever . <P> Paley makes the decision seem simple . " An assessment was being made of the quality of top leadership , bearing in mind that we had a long and important future and that I was going to pull away in time , " he explains . " It is something done by large corporations at all times . Mr. Backe heard about it and wanted to know what had been going on . When he was told , he took a very positive position . That led to a sort of showdown situation . " <P> Translation : Backe got word that he was under scrutiny and demanded an explanation from Paley . The showdown situation turned into an executive shootout on the 35th floor of the CBS Building . Says one industry source : " It was n't even gentlemanly . It was a real showdown . " <P> Whatever was said , Backe demanded that the board of directors choose between him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , announced its decision on May 8 , the day Backe returned from an affiliates meeting in Los Angeles . " The result , " Paley concludes , " was that Mr. Backe tendered his resignation . "
