Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov told the deputies that he was dropping his nomination of six ministers , including those in charge of culture , the state bank , the state price-setting committee and the petroleum industry , after the nominees were rejected by committees of the quasi-democratic legislature for being too closely identified with past policies. // Two others , most notably a protege of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev who had been named to oversee the all-important business of food production , withdrew their own candidacies in the face of likely defeat . <> <> Other Challenges Expected // " We have to get used to this , " Mr. Ryzhkov said in an interview after he conceded defeat during a session of the 542-member legislature , called the Supreme Soviet. // Although the rest of Mr. Ryzhkov ' s nominees to the 71-member Council of Ministers - the leadership of the executive branch of Government - survived committee hearings , several are expected to face challenges before the legislature gives its final approval to the new Government. // Mr. Ryzhkov ' s appointments would almost certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Gorbachev , the leader of the party. // " Had they been incompetent , poor managers , I would not have proposed them for these positions , " Mr. Ryzhkov said . Although he might have used the Communist Party ' s guaranteed majority to force the names through the legislature , the Prime Minister said he " could not find any serious evidence " to refute the criticism of the legislators. // " These people do not meet the growing demands of the people ' s deputies , " he said . <> <> New Candidates Awaited // Mr. Ryzhkov said he hoped to come up with new candidates acceptable to the legislators by July. // The Prime Minister ' s placid acceptance of the parliament ' s will suggested that the nominees may have been put forward to satisfy various high-level constituencies rather than out of Mr. Ryzhkov ' s personal enthusiasm. // Indeed , the economist Leonid I. Abalkin , a top Ryzhkov deputy , said today that in his view , " these weren ' t the best candidates. " // " It would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // But the defeats were regarded by many legislators as a turning point - a demonstration to those who run the Government that they have a master other than the Communist Party . No Government official had ever been rejected by the rubber-stamp legislatures of the past. // " It is really principally important because for the first time in I don ' t know how many tens of years the members of the Government feel they depend on the elected deputies , " said Igor Gryazin , a deputy from the republic of Estonia . <> <> Court Nominees Rejected // Legislative committees have also spurned three nominees to the Supreme Court on the ground that they were not well versed in the law , and rejected a deputy federal prosecutor accused of obstructing investigations into high-level corruption . These nominations are also expected to be dropped. // The jockeying for power in the Supreme Soviet also includes a pitched battle over control of the military and the state security police , which has drawn together an unusual alliance of civilian liberals and young military officers calling for a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The immediate issue is the makeup of a critical Supreme Soviet committee that will oversee the budgets and activities of those traditionally secretive institutions. // The panel , with a majority consisting of senior military officers , K.G.B. officers , directors of defense military factories and local party officials , has won initial approval , but critics have vowed to continue their fight . <> <> Committee Is Expanded // In a preliminary round , critics forced the expansion of the committee to include a deputy from the once-independent Baltic republic of Lithuania , where the Soviet Army is widely disparaged as an " occupying force. " // " That committee should be an organ of civilian control , " said Mr. Gryazin , the Estonian deputy . " We want to be sure that there will never be any kind of coup d ' etat from the military or the K.G.B. " // This week the chairman of the committee , a missile expert named Vladimir L. Lapygin , sought to offset this concern with an interview in Izvestia , in which he endorsed establishment of a volunteer , professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and called for tighter control of the K.G.B. // Much of the power struggle has taken place in closed committee meetings , with only sketchy reports in the press. // Beginning Monday , the legislature ended its practice of live television and radio broadcasts , on the ground that the novel , uninhibited legislative debate was distracting the public from work . <> <> Sharp Drop in Production // The press agency Tass said the leadership of the legislature decided to cut back on television coverage after learning that industrial production had fallen by 20 percent during live broadcasts. // Meetings of the legislature are open to foreign and Soviet reporters , and taped excerpts of the livelier sessions , including today ' s meeting , are being broadcast in the evenings. // The defeat of the new Government ministers was an indication that although the Communist Party can dominate the legislature on major questions , some of the working committees that will do most of the work of writing new laws are determined to assert their independence and that the leadership , for now , is wary of seeming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped from the new Government was Vladimir I. Kalashnikov , a provincial party boss , who as First Deputy Prime Minister would have overseen the troubled food sector . Legislators from farm regions accused him of being unsympathetic to agricultural reform , although he spent most of his career working under Mr. Gorbachev in his home region of Stavropol . <> <> Nominee ' s Record Attacked // Another early Gorbachev associate among the defeated was Marat V. Gramov , named to head the state sports committee . He worked as an editor of the Communist Party newspaper and party official in Stavropol when Mr. Gorbachev was party leader there. // Two nominees apparently fell victim to a strong environmentalist tide in the legislature : Gennadi P. Bogomyakov , a party leader in the Tyumen oil and gas region , was rejected as head of the Petroleum Ministry after Izvestia published a scathing attack on his environmental record , and Polad A. Polad-Zade failed to a win promotion to head the Ministry of Irrigation amid charges the ministry had recklessly wasted scarce water resources. // The environment has become such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned down offers to head the state committee on ecology , a post that remains unfilled. // " I think they felt that this job would bring very little joy to their lives , " Mr. Ryzhkov told reporters later. // Vasily G. Zakharov , the incumbent Minister of Culture , was dropped after a campaign by ethnic minorities who consider the ministry a symbol of federal attempts to dilute their traditional cultures. // Vladimir G. Gribov , formerly of the state planning agency , was rejected as head of Gosbank , the chief state bank , and Lira I. Rosenova , a 20-year veteran of the controversial price-setting committee , received only a single vote in support of her nomination to be promoted chief of the panel. //
