THE DYING YEAR By Margaret Drabble New Year 's Eve , and the end of a decade . A portentous moment , for those who pay attention to portents . Guests were invited for nine . Some are already on their way , traveling toward Harley Street from outlying districts , from Oxford and Tonbridge and Wantage , worried already about the drive home . Others are dining , on the cautious assumption that a nine o'clock party might not provide adequate food . Some are uncertainly eating a sandwich or a slice of toast . in front of mirrors women try on dresses , men select ties . As it is a night of many parties , the more social , the more gregarious , the more invited of the guests are wondering whether to go to Harley Street first , or whether to arrive there later , after sampling other offerings . A few are wondering whether to go at all , whether the festive season has not after all been too tiring , whether a night in slippers in front of the television with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doubtful prospect of a crowded room . Most of them will go : the communal celebration draws them , they need to gather together to bid farewell to the 1970s , they need to reinforce Margaret Drabbie ' s new novel , The Radiant Way , will be published by Alfred A. Knopf in the fall . their own expectations by witnessing those of others , by observing who is in , who is out , who is up , who is down . They need one another . Liz and Charles Headleand have invited them , and obediently , expectantly , they will go , dragging along their tired flat feet , their aching heads , their overfed bellies and complaining livers , their exhausted opinions , their weary small talk , their professional and personal deformities , their doubts and enmities , their blurring vision and thickening ankles , in the hope of a miracle , in the hope of a midnight transformation , in the hope of a new self , a new life , a new , redeemed decade . Liz Headleand sits at her dressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her digital clock agree that it is nineteen minutes past eight . At half past eight she will go downstairs to see what is happening in the kitchen , to see if Charles is in his place , to see if any of her children or stepchildren have yet descended , to prepare to receive her guests . Meanwhile , she has eleven minutes in hand . She knows that she ought to ring her mother , that there is still a faint possibility that she might ring her mother , but that possibility is already fading , and as the admonitory red glare of the clock clicks silently to 20.20 it gasps and dies within her . She will STORY 59 not ring her mother . She has not time . Instead , she sits there and for a moment contemplates the prospect of her party , the gathering of her guests . She knows them , their reluctance , their need , their larger hopes . She can hear their conversations , in cars , in bedrooms , in restaurants , at other parties , as time draws them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . She eats a pistachio nut , and fastens her locket . New Year 's Eve . A significant night , at least in journalistic terms , and there would be journalists here this evening , no doubt comparing their analyses of the bygone seventies , their predictions for the 1980s . And for her , too , significant in other , superstitious ways . Since childhood , since her early school days , New Year 's Eve had possessed for her a mournful terror : she had elected it to represent the Nothingness which was her own life , the solid , cheerful festival which had seemed to be the lives of others . New Year 's Eve in those early years had possessed a dull religious sheen , a pewter glimmer , which by much effort and polishing and dedication of the will could bring her a little light , a little hope , a little perseverance : but she had longed for the flames and the candles , the cut glass and the singing . Disproportionately she had longed , in the interminable wastes of adolescence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the longing had attached itself to this night , this one night of the year , when others ( she knew from schoolfriends , from the radio , from novels ) , when others went to parties and celebrated whatever was about to be . She had longed to be invited to a party , a longing which presented itself to her as a weakness and a wickedness , as well as an impossibility . She had comforted herself with her own severity . Finally , after long years , she had become a partygoer . How those oblong cards with her own name upon them had delighted her ! Crazily , disproportionately . And now she was a party giver as well as a partygoer . Her dressing table glitters and shimmers , it is festive like the night . It is white and gold , quietly ornate . Beneath the protective glass lies , imprisoned , flattened , a circle of Venetian lace , elaborate , fine , rose embossed , cream colored , expensive , handworked , beautiful , useless : a gift , though not of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand mirror , a silver-backed brush , an ivory paper knife with a silver handle . Over a little carved corner of the large oval mirror into which she absently stares , not seeing herself , hang necklaces ; amber , pearl , paste . She rarely wears them : she wears her little locket , superstitiously . The blond shells of the pistachio nuts , with their seductive little green gleaming cracks , repose in a small Sheffield-plate dish on a stem , an oval dish which echoes , satisfactorily , elegantly , the shape of the nuts : the surface of its lining is tinily scratched , pitted and polished , golden , antique , dull but shining . Behind the dish stands this year 's Christmas gift from her eldest stepson Jonathan : a tiny , cut-glass snowdrop vase which holds a posy of cold hothouse snowdrops , white and green , delicately streaked , fragile , hopeful , a promise of futurity . Liz Headleand is known to like cut glass , so people give it to her , on occasions , pleased to have their gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror , as though entranced . She does not see herself or the objects on her dressing table . The clock abruptly jerks to 20.21. he and Charles have never given a party on New Year 's Eve before . They have given many parties in their time , but on New Year 's Eve they have always gone out to the gatherings of others  --  sometimes to several gatherings in the course of the evening , and some years separately , not always meeting even for the magic chimes . A modern marriage , and some of its twenty-one years had been more modern than others . Maybe , Liz reflects ( for this is what she contemplates , through the oval mirror ) , maybe this is why they decided to have such a parry , this year , at the end of this decade : as a sign that they had weathered so much , and were now entering a new phase ? A phase of tranquillity and knowledge , of acceptance and harmony , when jealousies and rivalries would drop away from them like dead leaves ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed a celebration . Charles is fifty , she herself is forty-five . There is a symmetry about this , about their relationship with the clock of the century , that calls for celebration . And therefore grumbling couples complain in cars on their way to Harley Street from the Home Counties and beg one another not to let them drink too much : therefore stepchildren muster and stepparents-in-law assemble : therefore Liz Headleand 's mother sits alone , ever alone , untelephoned , distant , uncomprehending , uncomprehended , remote , mad , long mad , imprisoned , secret , silent , silenced , listening to the silence of her house . Charles and Liz naturally did not construct the notion of a New Year 's Eve party in this spirit , as a portent , as a symbol , as a landmark in the journey of their lives . As far as Liz can remember the idea came upon them rather more casually , one Saturday morning in early November over breakfast . Charles and Liz rarely breakfast together , they are both far too busy : Liz often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working hours are wildly irregular . But at weekends , they attempt to rendezvous over the Oxford marmalade , and on this occasion had succeeded . Charles , eating his toast , opening his mail , had suddenly exclaimed with a parody of fury , " Christ , it 's the Venables again ! " " What have they done to you now ? " she had mildly inquired , looking up from a photocopy of an article on " The Compulsion to Public Prayer : A Study of Religious Neurosis in a Post-Christian Society , " which she had just received in her own post , and Charles had said , Liz smiled . She enjoyed Charles 's little displays of anger , especially when she was in sympathy with them  --  as , on matters such as the Venables , she usually was . A good judge of character , Charles , she would sometimes with surprise reflect . " I think we should retaliate , " she said , a few minutes later , after skimming through the public-prayer paper and the letters page of the " Asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What , now , in November ? " He pushed the invitation over to her : she regarded it with mock distaste . " It 's got pictures of little cocktail glasses and tinsel spots on , " she observed . " I could see that for myself , " said Charles . " I refuse to invite them to dinner , " she said . " Of course we do n't have to invite them to dinner . Ludicrous couple . Ludicrous . " Times . " I think we should have a New Year 's Eve party of our own . That would serve them right . " " It certainly would , " Charles agreed . " Yes , it certainly would . " And they smiled at each other , collusively , captivated by this broad new concept of social vengeance , and began to plan their guest list : they owed hospitality to half London , they agreed , it was time for a party , it would kill many birds with one big stone . A vi-sion of dead , flattened , feathered guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned . That was how it had been , perhaps that was where it had started , thought Liz , as she stared into past and future before jerking herself back into the present , which now stood at 20.22 . The red clock from the bedroom reflected in the dressing-room mirror , at an interesting , an unlikely angle . Her eyes focused upon her own image . She looked all right , she concluded , without much interest . She bared her teeth at herself , pointlessly . Her teeth were quite large , but there was not much she could do about that now . Her interest in cosmetics was minimal , but she decided that it was after all a festive occasion , and she began at this late moment to apply a little mascara . Her mascara container was rarely called upon , and appeared to have dried up . She licked the curved brush , and tried again . A big black dry grainy nodule stuck itself unobligingly to her lashes . Impatiently she reached for a tissue and wiped it off . It left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed the black smear , restoring herself to her former state , which had been , and still was , in her own view , quite satisfactory . 20.23 . In a few minutes she would go down . She could have borrowed some mascara from her daughter Sally , but it was too late . She should have rung her mother in Northam , but it was too late . Seven minutes of solitude she had , and then she would descend , As she sat there , she experienced a sense of what seemed to be preternatural power . She had summoned these people up , these ghosts would materialize , even now they were converging upon her in their finery at her bidding , each of them willing to surrender a separate self for an evening , to cat , to drink , to talk , to exchange embraces , to wait for the witching hour . Soon their possible presences would become real presences , and here , under this roof , at her command , patterns would form and dissolve and form again , dramas would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed , acquaintances renewed . The dance would be to her tune . A pity , in a way , that the dancing would be merely metaphorical : this was a house large enough to accommodate dancing , but their friends were not of the dancing classes , would gaze in astonishment , alarm , sophisticated horror , intellectual condemnation , at dancing in a private house . . another year , perhaps , for the dancing . This year , the dying year , the social dance would suffice . It would be a large assembly : some two hundred had accepted , and more would come . She had encouraged her stepchildren and her daughter Sally to invite their friends : they would add color , diversion , eccentricity , noise . She likedthe mixing of ages , she even liked a little friction , and friction there would be : Ivan Warner alone was usually enough to raise the temperature of any social gathering to conflagration point , and Ivan in conjunction with Charles 's Fleet Street friends and television moguls , with a few publishers and poets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clutch of psychologists and psychotherapists and art historians and civil servants and lawyers and extremely quarrelsome politicians , would surely manage to set the place on fire . Surely this night the unexpected would happen , surely she had summoned up the unexpected . She had , of late , felt herself uncannily able to predict the next word , the next move , in any dialogue : she could hear and take in three conversations at once : she could see remotely , as through a two-way mirror , the private lives of her patients , sometimes of her friends : she had felt reality to be revealed to her at times in flashes beyond even the possibility of rational calculation : had felt in danger ( why danger ? ) of too much knowledge , of a kind of powerlessness and sadness that is born of knowledge . For these reasons , perhaps , was it that she had decided to multiply the possibilities so recklessly , to construct a situation beyond her own grasping ? A situation of which not even she could guess the outcome ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little , to lose control and stand aside ? To be defeated , honorably , by the multiplicity of the unpredictable , instead of living with the power of her knowingness ? With the limits of the known ? She had thought , back in November , that the party was merely a celebration , a celebration of having survived , so long , with Charles : twenty-one years , unique in the circle of their acquaintance . Battle and bloodshed and betrayal lay behind them , and now they met peacefully in this large house , and slept peacefully in their separate rooms , and met at weekends over the marmalade , and would continue to do so until Charles 's new appointment took him , in a couple of months , to New York . He would return to visit her , she would fly out to visit him , they would speak on the telephone , they would not miss each other . This was understood . Nobody expected Liz to uproot herself , like a woman , like a wife , and follow her husband to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pursuing her own career and pursuing her own inner life , whatever that might be . A modern marriage . Charles and Liz Headleand . Liz knew how they were regarded : as a powerful couple who , by breaking the rules , had become representative . They represented a solidity , a security , a stamp of survival on the unquiet experiments of two decades , a proof that two disparate spirits can wrestle and diverge and mingle and separate and remain distinct , without a loss of brightness , without a loss of self , without emasculation , submission , obligation . And the image , the public image , is not wholly false , although naturally its firm , talismanic outlines conceal a great deal of past pain and confusion , of dirty bargaining , of occasional childishnesses , of outright disagreements : and the present is not wholly peaceful . If it were , it would he dead , Liz tells herself . Conflict is invigorating , it renews energy . So she tells herself . She disapproves of a great deal of Charles 's life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his goals suspect , his methods dangerous , his new political alignments deplorable : but she is loyal to Charles , to Charles himself , to the man that these manifestations in her view misrepresent . She believes in Charles , in her own fashion , and believes that he believes in her . Their past , with all its secrets , is solid behind them , and can not be disowned . Their union has a high , embattled , ideological glamour ; their dissent is a bond . Her loyalty , she believes , is worth a great deal to Charles : it gives him plausibility . Or is this line of thought simply a rationalization of the truth , which is that these days she and Charles disagree about almost everything ? A celebration , a farewell party . Charles will be away for at least a year . She is glad he is going , she thinks . The strain of living up to the lofty concept of marriage that they have invented is tiring , at times , and she is a busy woman . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her peace , privacy . She eats another nut , and needlessly , absently , combs her hair . She finds it hard to think clearly about Charles . The time span of the thinking is too long , it makes the present moment arbitrary , a point on a graph that is in itself meaningless . She looks down at her shopping-and-memo list , to find a nearer focus . Perrier water , it says . Poinsettia . Prunes . Remind Deirdre about tabasco . Japanese seminar , Metro-pole Hotel . Ask Ivan about R.P. R.P. ? Who or what was R.P. ? She must have known last night , while constructing this list . Maybe it will come back to her , when she sees Ivan . She suspects that Charles suspects that she had once had an affair with Ivan , but of course she had not , though she concedes that Ivan is so unpleasant that only a degree of past sexual intimacy could plausibly explain the kind of relationship that he and Liz have over the years established . Charles had not wished to invite Ivan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is trouble , he said . But that is the point of him , Liz had replied . Liz prided herself on her tolerance of Ivan 's appalling behavior . Anyway , she said , we 'll have to ask him , or he 'll be evenruder about us in his next article . I do n't give a damn about Ivan 's ridiculous rag , said Charles , but of course he did , he cared much more than she did , and with reason , for Ivan usually managed to deliver her some backhanded compliment , whereas Charles always got it in the neck : " HEADLEAND CRASHES HEADLONG " had been the headline of Ivan 's latest piece of gossip , which had consisted of a dangerous account of Charles 's behavior at a meeting of a board of directors , laced with unfounded but inventive innuendo about a country house which he and Liz were said to be purchasing as a tax dodge . There had also been offensive remarks about Charles 's aging , toothless bite . Charles had been particularly annoyed about the toothlessness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : he had in fact been without his two front teeth that week , while having their thirty-year-old caps replaced , caps that marked a heroic accident long ago in a swimming pool in Sevenoaks . He had proved remarkably ( to her , touchingly ) sensitive about their temporary absence . Losing two front teeth , even two false front teeth , at the age of fifty , even if only for a week , had distressed him : he had sat opposite her at the breakfast table with a napkin over his mouth , and she knew that it had taken some courage to go to the board meeting at all . No , Charles certainly did object to Ivan 's insults , and Ivan 's divination of Charles 's weak spots was uncannily accurate . She , for her part , was of the opinion that she did not object to Ivan 's insults at all . She saw them as emanations of his own tormented , neurotic , anally fixated personality , and nothing to do with herself . She was convinced that he was in reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was grateful to her for her power of forgiveness , she suspected , for the absolution she continued to extend . Such an ugly , red-faced , no , worse , blue-faced little man . Small , squashed , snub , stout . She had known him for many years . One would have thought that the principle of people living in glass houses not throwing stones would have warned Ivan off a career as a journalist , gossip , and so-called satirist , but it did not seem to occur to him that he was asking for trouble of a kind that she knew would cause him the most intimate anguish : but in fact , so appalling were Ivan 's features and physique that comment on them was rare , even his worst enemies ( and he had hundreds ) not considering them fair game . Comment on his dreadful behavior , by contrast , flourished . Maybe , she idly wondered , as she drew a daisy by the words " Metropole Hotel , " maybe he chooses to be so offensive verbally in order to divert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ivan claimed success with women , despite or because of his natural handi-caps , and Liz herself , though she had not slept with him , had on one occasion in the early years of her marriage to Charles found herself , to her own surprise , sitting on a table in a flat in Bel-size Park Gardens with Ivan 's hand inside her bra . She could remember the incident quite clearly , although the circumstances surrounding it had vanished into oblivion , beyond recall of any form of analysis : it had been early afternoon , so clearly not a party incident maybe they had had lunch together ? ? and she had been anxious about picking up children from school . She kept telling Ivan that she had to leave , and he kept telling her that he was a great lover although his prick was only six inches long . Or something to that effect . And all the time his hand had been inside her bra . She could remember the bra , it had been rather a good black lace wired Kayser Bondor , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd never been able to find another . But why had they been sitting on a table ? And in whose flat ? These were mysteries now known only to God . She had not slept with Ivan , nor ever would , but was deriving a secret satisfaction from the knowledge that present at her party that night would be all the men with whom she had ever slept : or all save one , and he had been from another country , and she had not known his name . There were not so many of them : five , not counting the Dutchman , and one of those was Charles , and another her first husband Edgar Lintot , to whom she had remained married for less than a year . Of the other three , one had been revenge , one an escapade , and one half serious , but all had now merged into a sentimental distance , an affectionate presence . She had set much store by retaining or restoring her relations with these men , and thought she knew why ; after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childish marriage , she had been so afraid of ever again being engulfed by hatred and violence that she had maintained a resolute pleasantness even through the worst of times , even with Charles , who was not an easy man . She had called it maturity , this pleasantness . She was determined never again to be a party to the hideous transformation which overcomes the partners of a bad marriage , who grow fangs and horns and sprout black monstrous wolfish hair , who claw and cling and bite and suck . There would be no more of that : she would see the person as he was , and see him steadily , setting aside her own long shadow as it fell . Her success in this enterprise had fortified her in her career as psychotherapist , had given her confidence in her right to pursue it , in the rightness of her pursuing it . Even her first husband she had regained from that dreadful hinterland of marsh and bog and storm cloud : and now they were good friends , she and Edgar , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Health Service , the pathology of multiple murderers , the ethics of reporting violent crime ) had struck up alliances that excluded , that increasingly and dramatically excluded , her husband Charles . So there they would be , all friends together . Edgar , Roy , Charles , Philip , and Jules . She had finished with them all . Maybe she had finished with sexual intercourse forever , maybe it was this possibility that gave her this peculiar conviction of strength , this sense of invulnerability , of certainty , of power . They would attack her no more , weaken her no more . She had closed the gates . This was not orthodox , but then , although a Freudian , she was not an orthodox Freudian , and her vision of futurity did not exclude celibacy . From within herself , she would survey . An observer , a non-combatant . As a child , reading her mother 's collection of Victorian novels , Edwardian novels , she had wondered how women could bear to renounce their position in the center of the matrimonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves to consent to adopt the role of chaperon , to sit at the edge of the dance on little gilt-legged chairs gossiping and watching , spectators , as the younger ones innocently paired , as the older ones not so innocently paired , in the ever-changing formations of the floor . How could one bear to be on the sidelines ? Not to be invited to the waltz ? Not ever again to he invited to the waltz ? But now she could see the charm , could read the meaning , of the observer 's role , a meaning inaccessible to a sixteenyear-old , to a thirty-year-old  --  for the observer was not , as she had from the vantage , the disadvantage , of childhood supposed , charged with an envious and impotent malice , and consumed with a fear of imminent death : no , the observer was filled and informed with a quick and lively and long-established interest in all those who passed before , in all those who moved and circled and wheeled around , was filled with intimate connections and loving memories and hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for it was through the potency of the observer that these children took their being and took the floor . Actual children , children of the heart and the imagination , old friends , new friends , the children of friends , they circle , they weave , and the pattern is both one 's own and not one 's own , it is of the making of generations . One is no longer the hopeful or the despairing guest : one is host in the house of oneself . So thought Liz Headleand , as she sat at her dressing table , in her yellow-walled , her yellow marble-veined dressing room , eating nuts . She put her glasses on to peer once more at the vanished smear of mascara , and was amused to see the print of her face leap into sharp relief : a new trick , for her glasses were quite new . She dabbed again with the tissue . Her glasses amused her . So did the amusing little sag of her incipient double chin , the veining on her cheeks , the slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She truly believes this . She has good reason to believe it . 20.35 says the little red clock . She has lost five minutes , somewhere . It is time to go downstairs , to see how Deirdre is getting on in the kitchen , to make sure the butlers are not drinking too much . But her real worry was not so much the butlers as the cook , Deirdre Kavanagh , ex-girlfriend of her eldest stepson Jona-raised veins in the back of her hands , the broadening of her hips , the decreasing flexibility of her joints.These signs of age , of the aging process , she greeted and greets with curiosity , with a resolute welcome . One might as well welcome them , after all : there is not much point in rejecting them . It is all intended , it is all part of the plan . There is a goal to this journey , there will be an arrival , Liz Headleand believes . It is only by refusing to move onward that we truly than , a mad and dreadful girl with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a femme fatale , a conviction alas supported by her authentic Irish beauty and her seductive Irish brogue . By half past ten , Deirdre Kavanagh had was out of fashion , and busily engaged in conversation with a television journalist who had just returned from making a program for Charles in Iran . He was telling her about the Ayatollah , and she was telling him about her convent days . Their words fluttered between them like lubricious little doves . At Deirdre 's elbow stood the faithless Jonathan Headleand , who was trying to explain to his stepmother 's first husband Edgar why he 'd decided , after ali his protests , to follow in his father 's footsteps , while simultaneously trying to keep one eye on Deirdre and the other on his girlfriend Kate Williams , who was being harangued by a Tory backbencher about Marxist infiltration of the Open University . The Open University was also the subject of debate between Alix Bowen and Teddy Lazenby of the Department of Education and Science : Alix 's face was expressing a most delicate mixture of disbelief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indiscreetly presuming on their long , if long-interrupted , acquaintance , revealed what were clearly his own opinions on the inadvisability of wasting money on the education of housewives and taxi drivers . In other corners and other rooms , dozens of other topics floated gaily on the lively , slightly choppy waters , their pennants bobbing and fluttering in the end-of-year , the terminal breeze : the approaching steel strike , the brave new era of threatened privatization , the abuse of North Sea oil resources , the situation in Afghanistan , the prospect of a fourth television channel , the viability of Charles 's attempt to conquer the United States , the disarray of the Labour Party , the Yorkshire Ripper , the Prince of Wales . In a doorway , wedged between a Guardian editorial writer and a Minima analyst , Alan Headleand and his ex-tutor Otto Werner were debating with a fine abstraction and a noble disregard of interruption the question as to whether a television program was a primary product or a service , and whether , by implication or extension , Charles 's production company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allied in ideological terms with the manufacturing or the service industries : with equal commitment Esther Breuer and Jules Griffin ( colleague of Liz Headleand ) were discussing the nature of ancestral voices in schizophrenic patients and in Homeric and biblical epic , and the portrayal of the Holy Ghost in Anglo-Saxon manuscripts . Liz , moving from group to group , surveying from the stairway , engaging and disengaging , tacking and occasionally swooping , was pleased with what she saw . They were mixing and mingling , her guests ; the young were speaking to the old , men were speaking to women , left was speaking to right , art unto science . Liz foundherself involuntarily doing a head count of her own stepchildren and children : she could see Jonathan , Alan , and Sally . Her younger daughter Stella was away in Florence studying Italian . But where was her middle stepson Aaron ? She had not seen him for an hour or more , he had been here earlier , had he left in a fit of boredom , was he sulking in his bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the bend of the hail stairs , beneath the fake ancestor , waving down and shouting at her : " Liz , Liz , " he called , " it 's the telephone , it 's Stella , she wants to wish you a happy new year , she 's on the upstairs line . " The energy generated from running upstairs and laughing with Stella in distant Florence flowed over into the impulse to ring , in turn , her own mother : a pointless act , but one that nevertheless in the context seemed pious , necessary , propitiatory , and a gesture at least toward her sister , who bore so much heavier a filial burden , who would ( in theory at least ) be pleased to know that Liz had remembered . When Liz came downstairs again to her party , after a ritual exchange ( how could her sister bear such intercourse ? how could it go on ? ) , she found that she had lost her velocity . The brisk social wind that had driven her lightly from guest to guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratching clicking silence of the voiceless house of the long ordeal of her childhood : she found herself becalmed , for a whole dull stretch , talking to old Peter Birms , a charming old boy , but a bore , and so slow of speech that Liz could hardly restrain herself from finishing all of his ponderous sentences . When she finally shook herself away , she found herself sailing into yet more stagnant waters , for there , directly in her way , unavoidable , smiling passively , uncomfortably , yet unavoidably , was Lady Henrietta , dutifully offering herself for an exchange with her hostess . Lady Henrietta knew what was right : everything about her was right , from her tightly bound dark hair to her dark-blue satin slippers . The sight of her filled Liz with a subdued and dreary panic . Henrietta ( Hetty to her friends , of whom Liz was not one ) embarrassed her , she could never say why : she represented pain , failure , tedium , though not in her Own person : somehow , magically , she managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while herself remaining poised and indeed complacent , secure of admiration . Liz had never admired , and had at times expressed somewhat freely ( and in her own view wittily ) her lack of response to Henrietta 's frigid style and vapid conversation , but nevertheless felt herself , in Henrietta 's presence , rendered almost as dull as Henrietta , and moreover uneasily aware that in other houses , in other mi-lieux , at a distance , in other circles , she had seen Henrietta sparkling , laughing , surrounded by life  --  vacuous life , feverish small talk , no doubt , but life  --  a life that froze in Liz as she contemplated her guest 's stiff blue taffeta gown ( this was surely a gown , not a dress , and not even English , probably French ) , her exposed white bosom , her diamond necklace ( well , probably diamonds , why not ? ) , her high white forehead , her thin dark-red lips . Henrietta 's brow was high , and her hair was scraped hack from it and secured by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a Bambi head , a skull head , a too , too thin head , an overbred head , a painful head . Liz 's own forehead was villainously low , coarsely low . She did not know how to address Henrietta , she felt the fault her own , she knew herself to be disadvantaged . A chill , heavy waste of water lay between them , and in it floated the drowned empty skins of past attempts at rapport . Across this , the neat Henrietta politely presented a hand and a cheek . Cheek brushed against cheek . Each muttered some conventional phrase . It appeared that more was required , and Liz , resenting the inanity thus forced upon her even as it passed her lips , found herself saying , And how are you looking forward to the 1980s ? " " Oh yes , " said Henrietta , smiling meaninglessly , confirming Liz 's view that she never listened to a word that Liz said to her . Silence fell , during which Liz inspected Henrietta 's blue dress : it was poutily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shiny , non-absorbent fabric that Liz herself avoided , for it made her sweat ; indeed , it made her sweat to look at it . She was given to sweat : Henrietta , clearly , not . Perhaps the upper classes did not sweat ? She was herself , biologically , a peasant , but was rarely made to feel this to be an eccentricity , as she now felt . Gazing at the blue fabric , she noted that Ivan , ever present when least wanted , was intently watching this less than interesting encounter from a position just behind and below Henrietta 's left shoulder . His frankly delighted countenance spurred her on to effort : " I myself , " she heard herself saying , " am very much looking forward to going to Japan for the first time . Have you ever been to Japan ? " " No , " said Lady Henrietta , unhelpfully . Ivan laughed . " I am attending , " continued Liz , " a confer-ence . " " Really ? " said Lady Henrietta . " How long do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon Liz with the effect of an instant anesthetic : as she began to answer , she could feel her jaw growing rigid in mid-word . " Two weeks , " she managed to articulate , and then stood there , mouth clamped , feet rooted , as though turned to a pillar of salt , as though the deep deep bore-dom of childhood had reclaimed her , had ren-dered her helpless and speechless and powerless , the child in the attic , praying for time to pass and blood to flow . Which , of course , momen-tarily , it did : " Two weeks , " she boldly and brightly continued , breaking the trancelike stillness with a frisky movement of her head and braceleted right arm , " yes , two weeks , in Kyoto and Osaka , it should be quite fascinating , quite an opportunity to see a completely different cul-ture , of course it relates to our own work at the institute in a very particular way , it seems that there has been a considerable amount of re-search done in the department we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And on she prattled , watching with some satisfaction the slight tightening , profes-sional impatience of Lady Henrietta 's lip and the altering glaze of her china-blue eyes . Honor was satisfied , the courtesies had been observed , they could smile and part . Though I really can-not imagine , thought Liz , as she turned away , rubbing her hands together as though the cold had truly bitten her , as though the Ice Queen had truly touched her , why we continue to ask her round . Is it just because everyone else does , because she is the kind of person that people ask to parties , because her name inscribes itself by automatic writing on guest lists ? Are Charles and I really so susceptible to propriety , to the conventional ? Do we like to have people with titles at our parties ? What on earth is her title ? Who is she ? What a mystery it is , the way we carry on , thought Liz , as she moved in that funding : from theater director Alison Peacock , anxious about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bland , the aptly named chairman ( or so Ivan alleged ) of the Royal Commission on Royal Commissions , who was thinking that for various reasons he might have to resign , and from more bodies than one , before the jostling and the hinting pushed him into an undignified retreat . Not all were anxious , apprehensive , ill at ease . Many congratulated themselves on having found a new sense of purpose , a new realism : after years of drifting , of idle ebb and flow , there seemed to be a current . Tentatively , some dipped their toes to test the water . Others had already leaped boldly in the expectation that others would follow , that it would prove wise to have been seen to take the plunge first . Old opinions were shed , stuffy woolly shabby old liberal vests and comforters were left piled on the shore . Some shivered in the cold breeze of change : others struck out boldly , with a sense of freedom , glad to be unencumbered by out-of-date gear and padding , glad to cast off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : naked into the stream , exhilarated , the new emerging race . Cutting , paring , slimming , reducing , rationalizing : out swam the slim hard new streamlined man , in the emperor 's new clothes , out of the gritty carapace , the muddy camouflaged swoon , casting off the old ways , the old crawling , sinking ways . The conventions were changing , assumptions were changing , though not everybody was to enjoy or to survive the metamorphosis , the plunge , the leap into water or air . " Mother , it 's ten to midnight ! " called Sally from the doorway , and Liz , looking around the confusion she had summoned into being , the scattered earth , the scattered people , the murmuring , the singing , the clustering , thought yes , this was a party , yes , this was living rather than not living , this was permitted , this was planned disorder , this was cathartic , this was therapeutic , this was admired misrule . " Piano , Aaron , piano ! " she called , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clown 's face , emerged from the crowd and seated himself at the instrument , as Liz called to Deirdre and the butlers to fill glasses and then join the guests for a toast : Jonathan turned on the radio , the eagle-crowned clock over the marble mantelshelf struck , some joined hands and some did not , Aaron struck up " Auld Lang Syne , " Big Ben struck , some sang and some did not , voices rose straggling , pure and impure , strong and weak , tuneful and tuneless , there were cries and embraces . Two hundred people , solitude and self dispelled , Liz , at the magic moment , found herself unexpectedly clutching the hot hand ofed Light , on balding heads and shaven heads , on Mohican plumes and gelled spikes , on neatly barbered and dressed locks , on neglected middle-aged wispy bobs , on plaits and loops and layered body waves . The plural , the eclectic seventies . Dark suits , pale blue shirts , Indian kurtas worn not exclusively by Indians , striped mother-knitted pullovers , designer-monogrammed pullovers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , short skirts , exclusive French dresses , hand-stitched English dresses , prim high mandarin collars , plunging necklines , slit skirts , glimpses of suspender belts , clown pantaloons , dungarees , studded belts , limp leather belts , crackling metal belts , belts slung round waists , hips , bellies . Disparate , disparate , a hundred opinions , a hundred crosscurrents , in this blond Georgian drawing room : ancestral echoes of ancient Victorian philanthropy mingled with louche ghosts of Bloomsbury , public-school public servants held hands with hybrid tieless entrepreneurs of the television aristocracy , new modes of moneyed brutality addressed old shrinking brutality , the educated sons ( well , let us not exaggerate , one educated son ) of one skilled manual worker maintained an exchange with one exhausted feudal Northumbrian homosexual neurosurgeon . There they gathered , the employee who lacks employment , the faithless priest , the investor about to hang himself in the expectation of plenty , the physician who will not be able to heal herself , the director who lacks all direction , the historian who denies the existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the deaf man who hears voices , the woman about to be taken in adultery . A mingling , of a sort , in this exclusive , this eclectic room , this room full of riddles . Looking back , Liz would try to remember the moment at which she had known rather than not known ; she would have liked to have thought that she had known always , that there was no moment of shock , that knowledge had lain within her ( the all-knowing ) , that she had never truly been deceived , that at the very worst she had connived at her own deceit . Surely Ivan 's first sentence of the new year had alerted her ? ( Though that would have been late , late , late . ) Surely she had taken it as an ill omen ? But no , she had taken it at its face value : from Ivan , of all people , who spread malice as his trade . She had thought herself exempt . Slow she had been , unbearably slow , she who could hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , she who had been reared in the bosom of suspicion . She had thought herself invulnerable . She had been possessed by pride . Hints , glances , sliding words , oblique smiles , incomprehensible references .. Why had she not received them earlier ? Had she been too preoccupied with butlers , with introductions , with orchestration , . with champagne ? Messages had been sent forth , and she had received none of them , had continued to consider herself in charge , in control , the prime mover . Until , under the mirror , after many a circle and feint , after many a playful retreat and renewed approach , Ivan at last cornered her , and even before he opened his mouth she felt the smell of fear from herself : her pores broke open , she stood there panting slightly , her hair rising on the back of her neck in terror , her heated skin covered in icy sweat : " And when , " asked Ivan pleasantly , " are you two going to make the announcement ? IS it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words meant nothing , or should have meant nothing . She smiled foolishly .. Her mind leaped . It ran , it leaped , it scrambled for cover . It turned . " And why not tonight ? " she said . " You 've kept your own plans very dark , " said Ivan . " Ah well , you know me , " she said , knowing nothing . " I ca n't say I 'm surprised , " said Ivan . " I think you two stuck it out pretty well , in the circumstances . How long has it been ? Twenty years ? " The utterly expected , the utterly unexpected , can they be the same thing , she wondered ? Your name , " Ivan continued , " has been linked with Gabriel Denham 's , but I do n't even see him here tonight . " She stood there : he stared at her . She could say nothing . A pillar of salt . She was dependent on him . She could not move until he released her . " Whereas Henrietta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pity , " is very much at home here . " " Henrietta ? " Liz echoed . It was the moment she was most to regret . It betrayed ignorance . Only a second 's ignorance , but ignorance . Had Ivan noticed ? Desperate , she found again the faculty of speech , heard her own voice , familiar , natural , even powerful : " Ah yes , Henrietta . Yes , we see a good deal of Henrietta . " She hadno notion of what her words meant , but they sounded good , they fortified her , and she continued bravely , " But as for Gabriel , whose name has not been linked with Gabriel 's ? I think you must find a more interesting candidate than Gabriel . What about , for example ? " and she cast her eyes around her assembly , seeing reprieve in the approaching form of Edgar Lintot , her first husband , " what about Edgar ? Now that would be an interesting plot , for us at least . I see a great deal of Edgar these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , " ? and the plausibility of her own tone , at the moment , amazed her ? " sometimes . " " What 's all this ? " said tall , beaky , dedicated Edgar . " Gossip , is it ? I 've come to say good night , Lizzie . I 've got a long drive tomorrow . Very nice party , very nice . See you at the meeting . " " Yes , gossip , " said /van tenaciously . " We were talking about Charles and Henrietta . I won , der what New York will make of Henrietta . " Edgar was not listening . Ivan did not interest him , gossip did not interest him , he had given up the personal life . He kissed Liz on the cheek . " I think it 's on the thirtieth , is n't it ? Have a good time with the Japanese tomorrow . Do n't say I did n't warn you . " " Give my love to your mother , " said Liz . She managed to edge herself out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current . She followed Edgar a few paces across the room . Ivan , behind her , was accosted by a fellow journalist . He wanted to retain her , to keep her , to tease her , to worry her , to kill her , but he could not : she escaped . Escaped to a comforting , numbing succession of thanks and farewells , for the party was beginning to break up : " Happy New Year , " echoed again and again , as Liz searched vaguely for Charles but could not find him , Happy New Year , see you soon , goodbye , say goodbye to Charles for me , goodbye . And there , in a conspicuous lull , was Lady Henrietta herself , extending her hand and cheek . Seeing her , Liz saw it all . The certainty inspired her . She drew breath . " And when , " she asked politely , " do you go to New York ? " Henrietta looked back , with a frigid calm , beneath which lay a hesitation . " Ah , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , " said Liz . " Perhaps we could talk some time ? ... May I ring you ? We could have lunch ? " " Yes , " said Liz . She had won , temporarily : she had managed to give the impression that she knew . Though what it was that she knew , she could not at that moment have said . The two women kissed , again , and dreW apart .
