Remember the 1980s ? They had movie stars then . Burt Reynolds was the hot-shot hero with a good ole boy 's heart . Richard Pryor was the clown who mined laughter from his own black rage . Molly Ringwald was the teen queen who knew that growing pains could hurt like an all-over , seven-year toothache . <P> By 1987 , though , things had changed : shooting stars can be falling stars too . And sometimes audiences can get along very nicely without stars at all . Only three of the year 's ten top box-office hits could be called star vehicles , and each of them fronted a performer who seemed a corrupted form of one of the earlier models . Arnold Schwarzenegger in Predator : instead of an amiable hunk like Reynolds , an incredible hulk , muscle-bound and soul-bare  --  Robo-star . Eddie Murphy in Beverly Hills Cop II : instead of the wailing bantam Pryor , a strutting rooster , increasingly aloof from his genial gifts . Michael J. Fox in The Secret of My Success : instead of the teen queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too hungry to charm . He was a scrubbed-up version of the rich preppie Ringwald usually ditched in the last reel . <P> Meanwhile , Reynolds and Pryor kept making movies , but no one paid much attention . ( Remember Malone ? Critical Condition ? ) Reynolds occupied himself as director at his dinner theater in Jupiter , Fla. , and as executive producer of the TV game show Win , Lose or Draw . Pryor retreated into the shadows of his fading celebrity . Both stars made bigger news appearing with Johnny Carson or Barbara Walters to refute stories that they were ill with AIDS . Ringwald switched mentors , leaving John Hughes , who had made her a star with Sixteen Candles and Pretty in Pink , for Warren Beatty . It did n't work . Their film , The Pick-Up Artist , was the Ishtar of youth comedies : better than its rep , but still a resounding flop . <P> And now that the big Christmas films have made their mint , each of these former reliables tiptoes into town with a new movie designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pryor 's film , Moving , is a comedy about a mass-transit engineer who loses his job , relocates to the Idaho ruburbs and declares war on his " neighbor from hell " ( Randy Quaid ) . Among the cast are &lt; Saturday Night Live 's Dana Carvey , SCTV 's Dave Thomas and the World Wrestling Federation 's King Kong Bundy . Behind the camera is Alan Metter , who directed Rodney Dangerfield 's 1986 hit Back to School . Since Moving was unavailable for screening last week , we can only wish Pryor good luck . Reynolds and Ringwald , though , may need the power of prayer . Their new pictures , Rent-a-Cop and For Keeps ? , indicate that these engaging stars face a tough battle to win back their old fans .
