 | If you listen to the radio , you 've heard them . If you watch TV , you 've certainly seen them . An electrified cartoon of a redhead careering through a kooky party . A tarted-up floozy flirting in a gondola . Dressed in lingerie or lace or in regal gypsy regalia , singing in a girlish peep or a banshee wail , they 're the new women of rock and roll . Cyndi Lauper and Madonna are setting the pace . But they 've got a lot of company : Chaka Khan and Donna Summer , Sheila E. and Apollonia Kotero , Joan Jett and Pat Benatar , Sheena Easton and the Go-Gos , Teena Marie and Laura Branigan , Chrissie Hynde and Annie Lennox and ? perhaps the godmother of them all ? the great Tina Turner ( page 50 ) .

And after 63 weeks , Cyndi Lauper 's album , " She 's So Unusual " ( Portrait ) , is still charted in the Top 30 , with nearly 4 million copies sold . Lauper 's recordings have earned five Grammy nominations and her album has produced four Top Five singles ? a new record for female singers . As one of the most influential strongholds of knee-jerk misogyny , the rock scene has long cried out for women with power . ideas and an independent sense of style .

The current upsurge , however , has many different and even contradictory facets Striking new figures like Cyndi Lauper-@#  | whose anthem , " Girls Just Want to Have Fun , " offers a funny , subversive image of the liberated woman as screwball ? flourish beside much more traditional starlets like Madonna . In her new hit , " Material Girl , " Madonna exploits her feminine wiles like a determined gold digger : " The boy with the cold hard cash is always Mr. Right .

To Pat Benatar , a veteran hard rocker like Jett , the most striking change has been in her fan mail : " Most of my letters used to be from girls saying how glad they were that we emerged because it really helped them with their boyfriends . Now when I get letters , the girls aspire for themselves . " Applauding the fresh new atmosphere at some rock concerts , Gloria Steinem , an editor at Ms. magazine , says : " You do n't feel like you 're arriving in a room filled with testosterone .

She 's a maverick ? a newwave Betty Boop with the heart of Janis Joplin , the lungs of a screaming punk and the unflinching spirit of a never-say-die feminist . " I 'm glad to have a girl-following , " says Lauper . " Because I want to encourage them . I try to beget strength and , courage and purpose . I want to show a new woman . " Lauper 's musical methods are as uncompromising as her convictions . The startling yelps that punctuate " Girls Just Want to Have Fun " come out of left field . They prompt the listener to think : who is this woman and why is she singing this way ? Those are precisely the kinds of questions ? of identity and purpose ? that women in rock have traditionally dodged . Part of Lauper 's offbeat approach can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although she typically shrugs off questions about it with a joke ( " I 'm not a car " ) , a recordcompany biography for her first band , Blue ao  | Angel , lists her birth date as June 20 , 1953 . Unlike Madonna , who is 24 , Lauper is old enough to have experienced the heady early days of the women 's movement and to have undergone her own personal struggle to win respect . Brought up by her mother after her parents were divorced , she still bridles at the memory of how the women in her extended Italian-American family were stuck in the kitchen during holidays . Forced to attend convent school in New York City 's borough of Queens , where she was raised , she rebelled furiously against the holy trinity of church , family and state : " You know what I learned ? Those are the three biggest oppressors of women that will ever come along . " After dropping out of high school , she studied art , poetry , politics . The guys she met always seemed to marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says . " No matter how hard I tried to look normal there was always something that was n't right . " She worked as a waitress , a singing geisha , a judo-lesson sales clerk . " I started singing for a living , " she says , " because when I sing I feally do feel free . " In 1974 she began singing backup vocals for a bar band on Long Island . For nearly a decade , she fought for a break : " I had the desire to show them , " she says , " like ripping open your shirt like Isadora Duncan and saying , Here I am ' . " It was n't until 1983 that ' she released her first ? and , so far , only ? solo album : " She 's So Unusual . " Wrestling Manager : With her musical career now firmly established , Lauper has lately been free to indulge perhaps her oddest passion : pro wrestling . " Both rock and wrestling , " she explains , " have colorful characters . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sport by Capt . Lou Albano , a former wrestler and prominent manager who has appeared in several of her videos . Tongue in cheek , Lauper credits her own success to Cap'n Lou 's " P.E.G . " principle : politeness , etiquette and grooming . Last year she began to manage Wendi Richter , 24 , formerly the World Wrestling Federation 's female champion . " I am very serious about wrestling , " maintains Lauper . But she also obviously loves the sport 's hokum . At a match between Richter and wrestler Lei- lani Kai last week that was televised live by MTV , 22,000 fans roared in delight when Lauper punched Kai 's fearsome manager ? with a circus clown 's spring-loaded rubber fist . " If you get too serious , " Lauper says , " you could die of starch . " But she does have a message and takes pride in using her music and fashions and video image to express her convictions . In her bittersweet ballad " Time After Time , " she tried , she says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions , real life ? I was surprised that real life became popular . " Consider also her version of " Girls Just Want to Have Fun . " Originally a fairly routine ditty , it was written from a masculine point of view by Philadelphia songwriter Robert Hazard . " Oh , mother dear , " Lauper sings in her rewritten version of the song , " we 're not the fortunate ones . " In the video for the song , she made an effort to show " the way women really look ? not unglamorous , but more street culture than straight culture . " Such efforts have not gone unnoticed : Ms. magazine in January named Lauper one of its Women of the Year . Says she : " I 'm not trying to be different . I 'm just saying it 's OK to be yourself , and if you have a few quirky things , that 's OK , too . " That 's the kind of sentiment that could never come from Madonna , the other bestselling female rock star in America today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both sport shocks of wild hair , dress in mix-and-mismatch and fleasale fashions and project cartoon images of themselves . But the similarities end there ? witness Madonna 's old-fashioned sex-siren act on the MTV rock-video-awards show last October . Swathed in diaphanous white , Madonna descended from the top of a gigantic wedding cake and launched into " Like a Virgin . " Tossing back her bride 's veil to reveal a strapless gown , she purred the lyr-  | ics , lay down on the stage and began to writhe . No doe-eyed bride in " The Chapel of Love " ? and certainly no " new woman " a la Lauper ? Madonna promised a lot more than an invitation to dance . " I get so much bad press for being overtly sexual , " sighs Madonna . " When someone like Prince , Elvis or Jagger does the same thing , they are being honest , sensual human beings . But when I do it : Oh , please . Madonna , you 're setting the women 's movement back a million years ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman for having a sexuality when men for years and years have been singing about nothing else ? She 's just doing her thing . My thing happens to be different . Women have a sexuality that should n't be suppressed . " Far from suppressing it , Madonna flaunts it ? to devastating commercial effect . Her coy , seductive videos have helped sell over 2 million copies of her debut album , " Madonna " ( Sire ) . They also landed her work in Hollywood . Two weeks ago , " Vision Quest , " in which she appears as a singer in a bar , was released , and " Desperately Seeking Susan , " in which she has her first major acting role , will be released this spring . " I 'm very career oriented , " she says . " You are attracted to people who are ambitious that way , too , like in the song ' Material Girl . ' You are attracted to men who have material things because that 's what pays the rent and buys you furs . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Disciplined : Madonna Louis Ciccone was born in Bay City , Mich. , in 1960 . She was named for her mother , who died when the girl was six . Both disciplined and determined , she first became interested in performing through her junior-high-school ballet teacher : " Once , when I wrapped a towel around my head , " she recalls , " he told me I had a beautiful ancient Roman face . No one had ever talked to me like that before . I latched on to him like a leech and took everything I could from him . " After a year at the University of Michigan , she left for New York , where she first learned to play the guitar : " It was the most exhilarating feeling . I felt very powerful . " Resolving to seek her fortune in the music business , Madonna set out to crack the New York scene . " I 'm a very strong person , " she says . " It 's inevitable I would be taken as a ruthless sex kitten . By chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with have turned out to be helpful to my career . " Her big break came at Danceteria , a Manhattan club . Hoping to grab attention , Madonna made a point , she recalls , of dancing in front of the music booth and requesting a lot of records . Mark Kamins , the club 's influential deejay , finally noticed her , listened to her demonstration song tapes and began to play them in the club . The dancers liked the music . So did Sire Records , which signed her in 1983 at Kamin 's urging . Madonna remembers  | her reaction : " Give me the money . Take me , I 'm yours . " Dumping Kamin and the musicians she had been rehearsing with , she hired veteran soul producer Reggie Lucas , cut an album of glossy dance music and launched her career with her rock videos . Still , for all the jump-cut cheesecake , it is Madonna 's music that has pushed her over the top . Her sexually charged ambition gives her best records a tensile , beguiling strength . Nile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track for " Like a Virgin " that suggests a bright , major-key version of Michael Jackson 's " Billie Jean . " The lyrics ? all about how true love makes a girl feel " shiny and new , just like a virgin " ? fit like a glove . So does Madonna 's vocal . Her singing evokes the pie-eyed kid in " Bobby 's Girl , " the pert Marcie Blane hit of 1962 . But when Madonna summons a nervous , fey hiccup on the chorus , she sounds more like the giddy vixen of the video version . It 's a perfect pop epiphany ? pure erotic fluff . The changes in the rock industry that have made it possible for a performer like Madonna to claw her way to stardom halfnaked , and for Lauper simply to be her own goofy , free-spirited self , were a long time in coming . Most of rock 's first female stars were cut from the same Disneyland mold as Annette . Cute and sassy , they were homogenized Barbie-doll beauties : Connie Francis was the most popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break for women in rock came in the early ' 60s , with girl groups like the Shirelles , the Ronettes and the Crystals . The songs the girls sang , like " Be My Baby " and " ( Today I Met ) The Boy I 'm Gon na Marry , " may have given marriage a false glow of paradise . But their bee-hive hairdos and stiletto heels gave the game @#  | away . The boy they wanted to marry was probably a biker . The girl groups also gave women some of their first real behind-the-scenes power . Through the songs they helped to write ? " One Fine Day , " " Uptown , " " Be My Baby " ? Carole King , Cynthia Weil and Ellie Greenwich became major architects of the girl-group sound . King , of course , went on in 1971 to record " Tapestry , " one of the best-selling records in history . By then , the position of women had changed dramatically . It was music more than glamorous looks that won fans for King and for singers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups , of course , were still tailored to the starlet image : Motown released a steady stream of hit records by the Supremes , Marvelettes , Martha and the Vandellas . But the new FM rock stations also routinely featured singer-songwriters like Laura Nyro and Joni Mitchell , musicians who were taken seriously as creative artists . And the same stations made a counterculture icon out of Janis Joplin . Seismograph : Perhaps the single most influential model for rock-and-roll women , Joplin smashed the old stereotypes , in large part simply by ignoring them . She was not , in any conventional sense , " pretty . " Her beauty was in her bearing , her devil-maycare dignity , and in the ferocity of her spirit ? all things that she communicated through her voice , a piercing , often histrionic instrument . Like a sonic seismograph , it seemed to register every slight tremor in her troubled inner life . Joplin did n't spring from a vacuum . While most suburban kids were growing up to songs like " Where the Boys Are , " fans of black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Gon na Work Out Fine " ( 1961 ) , an early hit by Ike and Tina Turner . As Joplin knew , there was more where that came from . Her own repertoire drew from the bawdy blues of Bessie Smith , the belting emotion of Willie Mae ( Big Mama ) Thorton , the blunt , burning passion of Etta James . White listeners rarely heard this music . But when they did , whether by a white imitator like Joplin or by a true original like Aretha Franklin , they learned that being a woman did n't have to mean a life of meek deference and restrained romance . It scarcely seems a coincidence that the popular vogue for soul went hand-in-hand with the sexual revolution . Strumpet : Still , in rock , as in the larger society , the key breakthroughs for women were yet to come . Slowly , inexorably , the burgeoning women 's movement changed the whole climate of the culture . Donna Summer , who was typecast as a disco strumpet , was able by the early ' 80s to project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Money . " Other stars of the ' 70s , among them Bette Midler and Linda Ronstadt and Patti Smith and Deborah Harry , opened still more doors . They made it possible for rock women to be comedic or questing , demonic or glibly ironic ; the old limits simply did n't apply . This process came to a climax of sorts in England in 1976 and 1977 , when punk singer and songwriter Poly-Styrene of the band called X-ray Spex shrieked out , " I wan na be a frozen pea ! " Today , although the corporate elite that presides over pop music is still dominated by men , the developments of the last three decades have made it possible for women performers to choose from an increasing range of styles , sounds and images ? and to exercise more control over their careers . This fact alone suggests how conventional Madonna really is . Spelling out the most hackneyed male erotic fantasies , she 's like Veronica of the Ronettes ? without the tenderness , the vulnerability or the clothes . Other stars , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hynde of the Pretenders sings of love and sex with a candor and fire that Mick Jagger only aspires to these days . The GoGo 's have stopped pretending to be punkedout cheerleaders while playing muscular new wave . When performing live on network television , Annie Lennox of the Eurythmics is n't afraid to dress like Elvis in Fifties drag ? move over , Boy George . And when Tina Turner rasps her way through " What 's Love Got to Do With It " ? or when Cyndi Lauper screams out " Money Changes Everything " as an accusation and exorcism ? there 's a tone of tough-minded worldliness that 's far removed from the pompons and helpless pining of a Connie Francis . Says Anita Pointer of the Pointer Sisters : " Women are stepping forward on other fronts , becoming mayors and running for vice president . It 's the same in rock . " It is the artists themselves , of course , who will ultimately determine the significance of the current ferment .

" The most encouraging sign of all , though , may simply be the sheer variety of music , and of role models , now available . The women making a living in rock today include pinups and daredevils , cynics and dreamers , a few honest voices and a lot of pretty faces : just like the men . Despite the sexual exploitation and prejudices that remain , that 's a rough kind of parity ? and long overdue .
