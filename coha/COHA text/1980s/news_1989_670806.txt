For thought factories on the right , there is the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation . For libertarians , the Cato Institute holds down the anti-government fort. // The Center for National Policy caters to Capitol Hill Democrats . The Economic Policy Institute generally reflects the views of labor-oriented liberals . The Urban Institute , which concentrates on the problems of cities and the poor , harks back to an earlier model , the nonideological think tank . The Institute for Policy Studies is proud to stand to the left of conventional liberalism. // And then there is the Brookings Institution , the granddaddy of them all , liberal in image , generally centrist and highly academic in approach. // Enter the Progressive Policy Institute , the brainchild of Al From and Will Marshall , officials of the Democratic Leadership Council since its founding in 1985 . <> <> Thrust for Democratic Council // The council was founded by moderate-to-conservative Democrats like Senators Sam Nunn of Georgia and Charles S. Robb of Virginia . For four years , they have been trying to push the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal Democrats see as the right. // Having built one organization , Mr. From and Mr. Marshall are setting out to build another . The difference is not only that contributions to the think tank will be tax deductible , but also that no politician will have to be responsible for anything that the Progressive Policy Institute ' s academics happen to say . That , said Mr. Marshall , the institute ' s president , will make it easier to think freely. // The creation of a new think tank associated with the Democratic Party represents the continuing frustration of Democrats with the success that Republican ideamongers have had in winning publicity and acceptance for their thoughts. // " In the 1970 ' s , the intellectual revival of the Republican Party led to the Ronald Reagan Presidency , " said Mr. From , who will double as executive director of the leadership council and vice chairman of the institute ' s board . " We really need the same kind of thing on our side . " <> <> Many Models in the Offing // But what kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adversaries to copy . The American Enterprise Institute has been quite academic , like Brookings , and has made a point of including Democratic scholars in its ranks . Heritage , however , was built on a more combative approach. // " The chance that a legislator will read a 200-page monograph from A.E.I. or a 500-page book from Brookings is very slim , " said Ed Fuelner , the president of Heritage , who met with Mr. Marshall and Mr. From to give the new thinkers on the block some pointers . " So we developed the briefcase test : The paper has to be short enough to fit into a legislator ' s briefcase. " // Mr. Fuelner ' s other piece of advice was to pay at least as much attention to marketing ideas as to thinking them up . He puts a lot of stock in Heritage ' s in-house television studio , which allows television correspondents " to be in and out in 10 minutes. " // The trend in think tanks is toward the **25;115280;TOOLONG Heritage model . Mr. Marshall said his group plans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on topics like the future of the New Deal electoral coalition , economic competitiveness and voluntary national service . <> <> Admiration for a Rival // Since his institute is not the richest in Washington - it hopes to have an annual budget of $1 million - Mr. Marshall has looked with particular admiration toward the Cato Institute , which he thinks has done exceptionally well at popularizing ideas that are well outside the mainstream . These include such heretical concepts as voluntary social security and the notion that the end of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization might be good for American security. // The Progressive Policy Institute made its debut earlier this month with a heretical ( for Democrats ) paper of its own . Dr. Robert J. Shapiro , the institute ' s vice president for economic studies , argued that raising the minimum wage would not help very many among the poor and might even hurt some . Instead , the paper suggested that the Democrats push harder for an earned income tax credit , to put more money directly into the pockets of the poor. // Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economics in his Presidential campaign , said it did not bother him that his idea was similar to one that Vice President Dan Quayle has been pushing for months . " What we ' re trying to do is challenge orthodoxies on both the left and the right , " he said. // But over at the liberal think tanks , there was skepticism . " It didn ' t seem very progressive to me , " said Jeff Faux , president of the Economic Policy Institute . " The progressive position is that you need both a higher minimum wage and the earned income tax credit . " <> <> Basic Matter of Debate // Mr. Faux ' s remarks went to what may prove to be the new institute ' s most hotly debated idea : its name . The word " progressive " is usually used by liberal Democrats who know that words like " liberal " and " radical " are unpopular . Indeed , the most prominent academic associated with the Progressive Policy Institute , Seymour Martin Lipset , a professor of sociology at Stanford University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressive , " since public opinion polls show that label to be far more popular than either " liberal " or " conservative. " // In the great tradition of free discussion , Marcus Raskin , co-founder of the Institute for Policy Studies , challenged the new think tank to a debate over the word " progressive " and who has the best claim to it. // Mr. Raskin , who proudly thinks of himself as a man " of the left , " gave the new institute an early taste of what the contentious world of thinktankdom will be like . " I welcome the extremists of the center , " Mr. Raskin said , " and look forward to such ideas as they may have. " //
