THE BEAR <P> Directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud <P> Screenplay by Gerard Brach <P> An orphan bear cub . A big solitary bear . Two hunters in the forest . The animals ' point of view . <P> That may be the shortest treatment in the history of the movies . It is surely one of the most truthful because , seven years and $25 million later , the four modest sentences that set this film in motion still accurately summarize The Bear . And , ironically , they send exactly the wrong signals to the sophisticated filmgoers who should be its most appreciative audience . <P> The outline could as well describe a nature documentary or even a children 's picture  --  anyway , something bland , earnest or otherwise simpleminded . This is not to imply that The Bear , which is an adaptation by French filmmakers of a 1916 novel by the American outdoorsman James Oliver Curwood , lacks educational value . Or that children will not be charmed by the misadventures of its bouncy , cuddly hero . But the highest pleasures of this wondrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artful ways it transcends it . <P> The trick is quite simple to describe , ridiculously hard to execute . As director Annaud says , he and screenwriter Brach only placed their animals in very basic survival situations " in which a bear or a man would respond in the same ways . " That is to say , by resorting to their common store of instincts : to fight or flee , to seek food , shelter , sex . The difficulties of capturing all this on film , using actors that are willful , dangerous and , of course , nonverbal , requires awesome patience and artifice , both on location and in postproduction . At the level of technique , The Bear is to other films about nature what Star Wars was to science-fiction movies : a redefinition of the state of the art . <P> But like George Lucas ' film , The Bear works not because it is technically expert but because of the connections it makes with primal emotions . We form an instant attachment to a near helpless creature whose mother is killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cub 's attempts to survive on his own or to attach himself to a full-grown male as a protector-mentor . He is such a vulnerable little guy , infinitely curious and dangerously , comically distractible  --  whether by a passing butterfly or the moon 's reflection in a pond . <P> Indeed , as humans , with a powerful sense of our own species ' capacity for evil , we are more alarmed by the intrusion of hunters into the animals ' territory than these creatures , guided by untutored instinct rather than bitter experience , can possibly be . We fear for the older bear 's life as he does not ; we imagine the degradations of captivity as the cub can not . But these emotions are not imposed by the movie . There is almost no dialogue , no voice-over narration to cue audience response , and composer Philippe Sarde 's lovely score is similarly discreet . This very pure picture entrusts all its meaning to images , and then trusts the audience to read them correctly .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
