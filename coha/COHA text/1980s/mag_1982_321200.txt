Something about the bottle , about the bright red cap snappy as a frontier bonnet , and the white cotton cloud showing through the translucent plastic , and the label , wide and snug , and the staunch lettering of EXTRA-STRENGTH , the whole shape of the thing comforting , like an old-fashioned milk bottle or a VW Beetle : it looks especially good in rows . Something about the rows , all the neat chunky boxes , one after the other , facing forward like a drill team on the shelf . Something about the shelf , third from the top , aisle B , toward the rear of the store , about which there is also something , as there is about the street and the hour of the day , any day , and the headache or the sniffles . <P> The ruminations get to you . No , the Tylenol case is not quite like the Son of Sam killings or the Mad Bomber or the Atlanta murders , and not only because these latest deaths are more random . There is something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular little pill box that your hand has settled on , then standing politely in a row , ready to pay for your medicine . The trouble with poison is that you take it yourself , even when the murderer has spiked the gum on the envelope or when a Borgia has switched the wine . It is the victim who does the actual killing . That is why moviemakers focus so carefully on the glass of smoky milk jiggling on the silver tray as it progresses up the winding staircase toward the invalid wife . They know that we will want to follow the death instrument in the slowest motion , to see it grasped eagerly or laconically , at last to shudder . So one shudders picturing Stanley and Theresa Janus in Chicago a couple of weeks ago , stunned over the death of Stanley 's brother Adam a few hours earlier , the couple sitting in despair at the kitchen table , about to reach for the Tylenol . <P> Such gestures constitute normality . In the millions and woven together , they combine to construct what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company that makes the pill , the one that packs and distributes it , the Government agency that examines and sanctions it , the store that stocks and sells it , and so forth , all tied together by nettings in which life hangs , as they say , in the balance . Fascinating , how easily that balance can be threatened . Fascinating too how it protects and sustains itself . <P> At first hearing the story is outrageous , confounding . Do you actually mean to say that some maniac has been filling Tylenol capsules with cyanide ? Not that the wretched inventiveness of modern terrorism and science fiction have placed such acts entirely beyond the imagination . But we are not talking here about a bombing in a Bologna railroad station or of the Day of the Triffids . This is American everydaydom , the casual course of events . Alarmed , the mind skates hurriedly to the ifs : If Tylenol , why not aspirin ? If drugs , why not food ? October is the month for Halloween , after all . The razor blade in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pepsis ? We already had an eyedrop scare . Has n't the water tasted funny lately ?
