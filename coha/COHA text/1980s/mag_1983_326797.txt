A new U.S.-Soviet grain deal <P> " This is a happy hour , " beamed Secretary of Agriculture John Block last week . The reason for his exultation was a new five-year U.S.-Soviet grain agreement , the first since 1976 . Negotiated in London , Vienna and Moscow during the past two months , the deal raises the annual minimum Soviet grain purchase required under the earlier agreement from 6 million to 9 million tons . That means a boost for farm exports , but nowhere near the 16 million tons the Americans had originally wanted . Yet Block said the accord achieved " reasonable expectations " and " puts us in a better place to sell a little more . " <P> The agreement helps soothe the jangled nerves caused by U.S. policies during the past few years on sales to the Soviet Union . In 1980 the Carter Administration imposed a partial embargo on such sales in retaliation for the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . The Soviets responded by lining up other suppliers , including Argentina , Canada , the European Community and Australia . Result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of sales just when Soviet demands were surging . During the past twelve months those sources supplied 80% of Moscow 's import needs . Before the embargo , the U.S. provided 70% of Soviet grain imports . <P> The new agreement will be welcomed by American farmers . The U.S. offered the Soviets 23 million tons this year , but so far has sold only the required 6 million tons . The impact of the smaller sales was made worse by the global recession and the debt problems of customers for U.S. agricultural products in the Third World . The strong dollar also made it more difficult for foreigners to buy American grain and encouraged competition from other producers . As a result of all those troubles , the U.S. is expected to export $34.5 billion worth of farm goods this year , a drop of more than 20% in two years . <P> Awash in grain , Washington began the Payment In Kind program to cut down on the huge surpluses by encouraging farmers not to plant . PIK has reduced the oversupply of some crops , and wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 66.3 million tons this year . But wheat stocks are nonetheless expected to rise , even with fewer acres planted . <P> As far back as the 1980 campaign , Ronald Reagan pledged to keep international politics out of the grain trade . It was a hard promise to fulfill . Under pressure from U.S. farmers , he removed the partial embargo in April 1981 . But that December , the White House saw the imposition of martial law in Poland as reason enough to bar grain negotiations with the Soviets . This April , though martial law was still in effect , the President gave the green light to begin the negotiations that resulted in the grain deal . Last week 's successful talks coincided with another sign that Washington is ready to be more conciliatory about Poland . The U.S. agreed to join Western creditors in rescheduling Poland 's $17.5 billion foreign debt . <P> The new grain agreement comes when the Soviet Union is enjoying a rare good harvest . The Agriculture Department forecasts a healthy Soviet grain crop of 200 million tons this year , short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since 1978 . That will reduce the Soviets ' grain-import needs for the next twelve months to 30 million tons , from a peak of 46 million tons two years ago .
