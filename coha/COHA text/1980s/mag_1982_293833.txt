As clean and fresh as a magenta night sky , Georgia O'Keeffe 's canvases have long evoked both the energy and the purity of her adopted American Southwest . And now , at the age of 94 , O'Keeffe has turned anew to a medium she all but abandoned in 1917 : sculpture . Apparently inspired by her assistant and acolyte , Juan Hamilton , 36 , O'Keeffe finally completed Abstraction , an 11-ft. spiral of painted cast aluminum . Now on display in a sculpture show at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art , her first major work as a sculptor gives her further claim to the title of doyenne of American art . <P> <P> Another title , the Marques de Pubol , has the perfect ring for the surreal image of its outre honoree , Salvador Dali , 78 . <P> <P> The artist has been tapped to be a member of the Spanish nobility by King Juan Carlos , 44 . The honorific ( after the Iberian castle Dali bought for his late wife Gala ) is not so terrific : no House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as contentious as ever , however . Last week he reportedly claimed that organizers of a retrospective had included 80 bogus canvases in the show . Pooh to Pubol , says one of the organizers , his former personal secretary Peter Moore .

He has been on a two-week cross-country trip in a private railway car , and from the start in Vancouver the Prime Minister was met at virtually every stop along the way by picketers , protesters and assorted Trudeauphobes , who screamed obscenities and lustily pelted his railway car with eggs and tomatoes . Particularly annoyed by out-of-work demonstrators at Salmon Arm , B.C. , Trudeau responded before TV cameras with a monodigital gesture that prompted one observer to note : " Let it never be said that the Prime Minister refused to lift a finger on behalf of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you many things , my boy . Do n't tell shaggy Wookie stories , for one thing . Also , always be on the lookout for a hot book property . While you were off chasing Princess Leia , Rusty Miller , 12 , a junior high school student in Satellite Beach , Fla. , came up with The Jedi Master 's Quizbook , a compilation of 425 intergalactic questions that will have Yoda himself scratching his noggin . After seeing Star Wars five times and The Empire Strikes Back six , young Master Rusty spent three months compiling his collection , which his mother typed up . George Lucas , 38 , the father of us all , approved the project , and that means the Force will be with it upon publication in November . How many legs does a Probot have ? Four-but even I , Obi-Wan Kenobi , had to run the films through my Betamax for that one . As to the others , Luke , you must search out the answers for yourself .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
