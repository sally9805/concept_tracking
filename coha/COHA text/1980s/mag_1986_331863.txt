The goals set by President John F. Kennedy were noble : to create a " peace corps of talented young men and women , willing and able to serve their country . " Living like those they had come to help , the volunteers were to bring modern skills to the primitive , the diseased and the ignorant , and to show off America at its best . Twenty-five years after the founding of the Peace Corps , some 6,000 volunteers still labor in 62 nations , but the agency 's lofty ideals are tempered by a sense of its limits . Critics , including former volunteers , have questioned whether the corps actually helped or merely provided an exotic interlude for thousands of young Americans . Last month TIME State Department Correspondent Johanna McGeary returned to a remote Kuna Indian village on the island of Playon Chico off the Atlantic coast of Panama , where she lived as a Peace Corps volunteer for 16 months in 1968 and ' 69 . Her report on what the intervening two decades  --  and the Peace Corps  --  had wrought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dipped precipitously over the jungleclad mountain to land . I had first made the same scalp-tingling descent in the dark days of June 1968 , leaving behind a U.S. that seemed to have betrayed its ideals . Without a doubt , I was more passionately opposed to the Viet Nam War than knowledgeable about my work in Playon Chico . Nevertheless , like so many other idealistic but technically untutored volunteers , I was determined in some vague way to do good . Now I was returning to discover if we had . <P> My work among the Kuna had been fascinating and frustrating , seemingly ill connected to the noble purpose of Peace Corps service . It was a first-rate anthropological experience for me , I concluded , but what was it worth to them ? Had our efforts helped improve the lives of the Kuna ? I certainly questioned the very wisdom or possibility of our " doing good . " Our vegetable project , a benign attempt to improve the Kuna 's subsistence diet , had been a complete failure . The Indians did n't want to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Eventually , a Kuna friend patiently explained why : the vegetables had to be weeded every day , he said . " But here , each morning I decide what I will do . Today I will pick coconuts . Tomorrow I will fish . The next day I will get water or cut bananas . So you see , " he concluded , " on my island I am king . " <P> With that I came to believe that Peace Corps volunteers could not impose our particular notions of civilization on other people . The Kuna culture was poor and primitive , yet it had an idyllic quality that was light-years away from the hardscrabble poverty of the campesinos in the Panamanian interior . I had even for a time come to like a life reduced to basic necessity : fetch water , prepare food , wash clothes , catch fish , paddle the boat . <P> To my delight , I found that the Kuna still do all these things in the old way . Upon my return , the Indians who welcomed me with warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone only a few days  --  perhaps because the years had changed their lives so little . The Kuna still spend half a day paddling to the river on the mainland to bathe , wash clothes , collect water . Intrusions of modern culture are few : more outboard motors for the wooden cayucos , tape decks and boom boxes everywhere .
