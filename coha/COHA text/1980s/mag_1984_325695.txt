Last week in Ames , Iowa , real farmers asked Democratic presidential candidates questions about agriculture , which the farmers feel is in dismal condition . The idea was to get a measure of the knowledge and concern of these would-be Presidents . In a couple of weeks , a debate sponsored by the Des Moines Register will allow these men to question one another and answer a few queries from the newspaper 's scholarly Washington bureau chief James Risser and a few more from knowledgeable lowans . No Phil Donahue , no Ted Koppel , no Hollywood , lowans have always had a bit more than their share of good sense . <P> Perhaps some time in the past 25 years , in a superpower summit somewhere or in one of the great legislative struggles in Washington , the day was won by a President standing on a stage and waggling his finger at his adversary and out-shouting him . If so , the event has not been recorded . <P> Theatrics is a legitimate part of statecraft . But how much ? The principal memory from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogfight between John Glenn and Walter Mondale . The spectacle was geared for combat . <P> " Let 's go to it ! " exulted Koppel . Donahue was the designated baiter . Zap , pow , thud ! If the candidates could do that to one another , think what they could do to the deficits , Pentagon cost overruns and those nasty types in Latin America . <P> That one of the problems of governing today is the excessive partisanship of Republicans and Democrats seems not to have bothered the television impresarios , who appear determined to make the campaign the biggest Gong Show of this singular year . " Politics became fun , " burbled Washington Post TV Critic Tom Shales . " National fun on live TV . . . nearly as action-packed as The A-Team . " Will the political handlers , consultants , producers and scriptwriters-a flourishing industry now in league with the media-turn this campaign into a litany of despair , with each candidate exaggerating America 's problems in order to sell his own solutions ? Pray for a triumph of calm consideration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates were asked at Hanover if Ronald Reagan had done anything worthwhile in three years , there was silence except for a flip answer from Mondale : " I think one of the fine things they did was to get rid of James Watt . " That silence was disingenuous , since Reagan obviously has done a few worthy things . It was also an insult to the intelligence of 54% of the American people who , according to George Gallup , approve of Reagan 's leadership in some way . But the President has too often led the political charge . <P> How much better off we would be if Reagan had buried partisanship back in the summer of 1981 and taken Speaker Tip O'Neill 's budget compromise , which would have held down the deficits that now threaten to bury us . How much better off we would be if Reagan had muted his ire at the Soviet Union and heeded the public 's nuclear-arms concerns .
