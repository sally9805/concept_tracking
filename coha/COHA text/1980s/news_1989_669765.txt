by Gabriella Fiori , Translated by Joseph R. Berrigan , // Athens , Ga . : University of Georgia Press , 380 pp. , $35 <> <> IT could just be that Simone Weil ' s time has come . When she died in 1943 , she was only 34 years old , but well known as a political philosopher in Europe . She had been an activist in labor and radical movements ; and she had fought with the anarchists in Spain . Wherever she went , she seemed to exhaust the potential of a given ideology or movement by living out the meaning of the ideas. // // As Gabriella Fiori ' s superb new biography suggests , Weil turned away from political action toward contemplation as the ground of her existence . She turned away from materialism and atheism and embraced a very special form of faith. // Weil ' s story is pertinent in this time of the breaking of nations . As Eastern Europe bursts like an ungainly phoenix from the ashes of collectivism , who knows whether it will fly or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weil ' s path. // That path is really an odyssey . Fiori charts Weil ' s wandering course from the intellectually rich home life given her by her loving parents , nonreligious Jews who even followed her to the Spanish front and brought her home after she injured her foot . After Weil studied philosophy , she taught for a while before she discovered what she called , much later , her true vocation , which involved ' ' indifference to all ideas . ' ' She put her ideas , and her frail body , to the test of manual , unskilled labor . Now she began to see life from the ' ' workers ' ' ' point of view . In words that Gorbachev would echo , Fiori explains Weil ' s conviction that to be free , man should not escape work but discover a motivation for overproduction . Weil ' s ' ' aesthetics of work ' ' grows out of her direct experience in the workplace. // Weil traveled to Germany and witnessed the competition between the Nazis - the National Socialists - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the true needs of workers . Thus she became an outcast in radical movements. // As she rejected radical movements , Weil became interested in Christianity . She would never accept the violence of the Old Testament God , and she would never accept the use of force by the Holy Roman Empire . For Weil , there was a strict continuity from the Roman Empire , through the Middle Ages , to Hitler : The wedding of the state to force . Totalitarianism , as students of contemporary Europe now understand , happens when truth is defined by force. // But a trip to Italy revealed to Weil a dimension of experience that pointed in another direction . Fiori writes , ' ' Never satisfied , she spends hours before the Last Supper of Leonardo and the Christ of Mantegna , the Michelangelo of the Medici chapels and the Concert of Giorgione . She is struck by the room of Botticelli in the Uffizi . ' ' The image is moving : this severely intellectual young woman who disguised herself in rags and who rejected the occasional love affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intoxicated ' ' with the joy of this art ! // With Hitler ' s armies threatening to invade France , Weil experienced the turning point of her life . She goes to Solesme during Holy Week , 1938 . She meets a Benedictine and two ' ' Englishmen ' ' ( one was American ) who together , but separately , help her discover an overwhelming dimension to existence , a dimension that does not erase her hard-won Machiavellian awareness of reality in politics , but one that opens her to a personal source of order and joy . As Fiori shows , Weil disovered that ' ' despite everything ' ' God might love her. // Weil ' s deep compassion for the workers , her willingness to reject heady ideas for the experience of suffering others go through , her altruism , is now completed by a higher form of suffering : the patience and compassion that springs from faith . Weil ' s writings on this experience of faith , collected after her death , are a valuable waymark in the European search for a nonideological mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fiori explains Weil ' s breakthrough : ' ' By directing , even in an imperfect way , our power of attention to the proper reading and imploring light from on high for this reading , we progressively climb a little higher , and this happens with every action we achieve with this attention . ' ' Then she quotes Weil : ' ' Nothing good is ever lost. ' ' // Fiori ' s intellectual biography is a splendid achievement . Through narrative , paraphrase , and quote , she reveals the continuity and development of Weil ' s experience . She rejects the approach taken by others who fail to see the connection between Weil ' s womanhood and her radical thinking about the key issues of our time. // ESCAPING the Nazis , the Weil family went to New York . But Simone wanted to get back to France to be with the people . She got as far as Kent , England . Her proposal to form an elite order of nurses to serve on the front lines was rejected by de Gaulle . The Ministry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychological care would have been a boon . Weil thought of it as a response to Hitler ' s racist ideology. // Never particularly strong , Weil ' s health failed when she rejected food that she thought should be sent to her compatriots in occupied France . When she died in her bed , she seemed at peace . Fiori ' s biography compels the observation that Weil must have thought she had exhausted the potential of political and social action in her time. // Fiori concludes that to grasp her message , we must see her whole , not as genius and woman , but as ' ' woman-genius . ' ' ' ' By reviving the inward quest of man in history , she has discovered the key to a wisdom which can be applied to the daily life of every man on both the individual and the social plane. ' ' // This is an important book . It answers the question of the hour : What next ? The crisis in Europe is far more than an occasion for self-congratulation by democratic regimes . History is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weil . Having recapitulated so much of modern history in her short life , she looked beyond history and found peace . She could do no more. // Now that there ' s a receptivity to going beyond totalitarianism , Weil will be heard. // //
