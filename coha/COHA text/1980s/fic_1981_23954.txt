RUNWAY A story by Jim Shepard H E OFTEN WONDERED , sitting at the window watching Billy and Theophilus play in the street , what he would do if one of them were hit by a car . Billy sat against the telephone pole , where he always did , where the driveway met the street , throwing the chewed-up tennis ball off the raised curb on the other side , perpetually fooling Theophilus with its change of direction . Theophilus would bound toward it as it would hit and ricochet or arc softly back , just beyond his snapping jaws , to Billy . w ITH A SON like Billy you do n't wonder things like that , Jay often thought . Has the boy ever come close to doing anything reckless ? Has the boy been anything less than all he should be ? He sat before the TV , clasped and unclasped the arms of his chair , and nudged his son , lying on the floor in front of him . " Hey . Anybody ever tell you you 're the greatest ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TV and he drummed his fingers on his knee . " Where do you go on those walks of yours ? " Anne asked . She leaned her film book , ponderous and lavish , forward on her lap , delicately , expectantly . Garbo loomed out at him . " And he gets it from you , " he said , standing . " Jay , " she said , " that 's wonderful . But you did n't answer my question . " He smiled and leaned forward and kissed her , holding the kiss a moment longer than she expected , before straightening up . She looked up sharply . " You 're going on one now , are n't you ? Jay , where do you go ? " " You sound tired , " he said . " I am tired . " She switched off the lamp and looked back toward the television . She looked beautiful in its light ; indistinct , ethereal . " This is almost over . I 'll turn it off . " " No , it 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jay touched his wife 's ear , once , for a goodbye , and slipped away . T HEOPHILUS had almost been hit once , by a big Buick . Jay had heard the screech but no thump and no horn , and he 'd reacted , he 'd thought later , as if he were underwater , swimming futilely toward the door and reaching the front yard in time to see Anne already crouching over Theo , making sure he was all right , with another arm around Billy 's shoulder . The driver had waited for him to get there before leaving , but he had n't had anything to say when he arrived . Anne , passing him on the way back in , had said , What were you , asleep ? and he had n't been able to shake the feeling of being underwater until hours later , watching the Bruins . H E LEFT ANNE watching TV and crossed through the kitchen , easing around Theo , asleep on the floor , and opened the door softly , still thinking of Anne 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , down the street at an unhurried pace ; yet very quickly , it seemed , he was deep into the darkness , away from the house lights , away from even the streetlights , floating off-white and quiet in the fog . The lights receded and the darkness and quiet increased because his street was a dead end , and he was going to the end of it , heading for the fence beyond the pavement , heading for the airport beyond the fence . H E HAD AN ARRANGEMENT with Anne for Thursday nights if the Bruins were on . He 'd watch a little bit of the first period and all of the third , and she 'd watch most of " Masterpiece Theatre " in between . Sometimes he watched it with her ; sometimes he sat by the window in the living room , often with the lights out . Billy usually watched both . T HE SIEBERTS ' DOG , the big Doberman , would start barking , he knew , at the rattle when he reached the fence , and would keep barking until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the base of the bluffs , picking his way through the tangle of brambles and fallen birches in the moonlight and fog . As he got to the fence and the Sieberts ' dog started up , he realized through the links just how foggy it was , realized he would n't be able to see much tonight . It was no problem . He slid through the damp , smooth hole worn between the dirt and the fence ; he knew his way around.0 NCE HE 'D COME into the room during " The Life of Dickens " and asked Anne if he could change it , and she had n't answered , and when he 'd changed it , he 'd just missed Lambert tying it up for the Canadiens , so they 'd both sat watching the end of the game , mad . Billy was nine and Theophilus was four and Anne was twenty-eight , and he spent as much time as he could with them , watching . They were all happy . When he thought of his family he saw Theophilus , snuffing under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds , barking and leaping , splay-legged , at Billy 's tennis ball . Anne was happy . She loved her job and concentrated on it at home in a knit-browed , serious way that be loved ; she loved her books , her cooking , her film studies . Billy was happy . He had his father and mother and Theo . Theo was happy . Everybody was happy . S HE THOUGHT , once on the bottom , runway level , the fog was no problem . He headed for the four red lights stretching diagonally away from him , watching for any security vehicles , the fog inviting him and closing behind him . At this point he was always alone with the lights , the houses on the bluffs overlooking the runway disappearing even without the fog . Within moments his foot landed , abruptly , on the hard surface of the runway . He crossed to the center of the red lights looming around him in order , chest high ; at attention , it seemed to him , pleasingly obedient and waiting . He held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his skin , flashing out between his fingers , creating a pleasing , instant X-ray . and he held on to the thick , warm glass and leaned back , squeezing , staring out into the fog in the general direction of the approach pattern of the planes . He pulled away from the lights , finally , moving toward the center of the runway , the circling beam of the tower in the distance making him feel calmer . When he could make out the sweeping , large white numbers of the runway designation beneath him , he sat down and looked back at the four red lights , still silent and waiting . Then he lay back , spread-eagled , and looked straight up into the fog . It was n't long before he heard the first plane . It was a light , far-off buzzing at first , starting way beyond his left arm and circling quietly , slowly , around him until it was coming . harder and louder , from below his heels . He told himself he would n't look , he 'd keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed already over him he jerked his head up , his chin on his chest , and caught the landing lights full in the face . They passed over him in an instant , streaking up the runway far ahead of the plane , leaving him momentarily blinded , but everything reappeared immediately and right overhead swinging toward him like a great pendulum were the red and white lights , spread out unevenly in a line and gleaming on the smooth underside of the wings and fuselage , the wheels swaying low beneath them . He rolled , face pressed against the pavement , as the noise rushed over him in a wave , shaking him , and was gone . He rose to his elbows , watching the plane skirt into the fog , the lights slowly joining the lights of the tower . He marked the spot in his mind and visually computed how far into the runway the next spot should be . Then he left , heading for the bluff at a good speed , because airport security was n't that bad . T HERE WAS NO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them wildly to baffle airport security , for he was almost certainly reported each time by the incoming pilot . Varying it was no problem for him : he had no overpowering need to be there . Sometimes he waited as much as three months to go out , watching the security patterns through the chain-link fence at the end of the street . Sometimes he went as often as once a week . This week he was going twice : Thursday and Saturday . H E REMEMBERED a movie he had seen some years ago called The Magnificent Seven . In it , Steve McQueen , one of a group of gunfighters who have banded together for no apparent reason to protect a poor Mexican town from bandits , is asked by the bandit chief why they stay and fight against insurmountable odds for no reward . He replies , " Well , it 's like a guy I once knew in Waco . Took off all his clothes one day and jumped into a cactus . I asked him why he did it . " And the bandit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ? " And McQueen replies , " He said it seemed like a good idea at the time . " w HEN HE GOT BACK Billy and Theo were on the porch , waiting , and Billy said , " Where 'd you go , Dad ? " He realized that he was still shaken , flushed , and he put his hand over the top of Billy 's head and shook it playfully , feeling exposed in the bright light . " I went for a walk . What 're you , a cop ? " But Billy held his ground , staring up at him , and he was forced to turn to Anne , quickly , guiltily ; she was next to him , behind the partition , the phone to her ear . " Yeah , Mom . He just came in . You know how he is with the walks . " She gave him a stern look and he kissed her until she had to pull away to say , " Yes , Morn , yes , I 'm listening , " and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Reilly and Gilbert bein. interviewed on the news , the series with being now tied at three apiece . S ATURDAY NIGHT he heard a Piper , twin engine , it sounded like , even before he 'd found the spot he 'd marked . He went to his knees and scuttled forward , approximating where it would have been , and spun around . The lights were banking , slowly coming around to level , parallel now to the four red lights of the runway edge . The noise increased , and he picked up the landing lights slipping slowly along the ground , suddenly speeding up and flashing over him as the roar grew louder and the lights sank closer , and at the last moment he flattened out as much as he could on the unyielding surface of the tarmac , turning his face as his ears filled with sound and his clothing shook and he felt it touch down hard behind him , the shock traveling through him , and he knew , as he got up , running for the bluff , that the next time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last time . w HEN HE THOUGHT about why he did what he did , no easily definable answers surfaced . Nothing made him do it , he would think , mowing the first summer grass or piling clippings into the trunk to take to the dump ; but part of the reason , he knew , was the way he felt that first split second when he heard , or thought he heard , a Cessna , or an Allegheny , make that distant , slightly unreal buzzing far off in the night . H E 'D BEEN OUT nine times , each time moving his six-foot , three-inch frame six feet , three inches farther out into the runway , each time coming closer to the touchdown point of most aircraft . Of course , there 'd always been the chance that someone would touch down early , too . He bustled around the house after supper for a week , cleaning , fixing , storing , straightening up , and Anne watched him happily and took him aside and said , smiling , " You 're a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he started to pull away , hedge clippers in hand , she became serious and added , " You 're wonderful , do you know that ? " He settled his affairs at work , getting the last shipments of the week out almost two days early , working with such efficiency and cheer , even for him , that his fellow workers were sure something was up , and , as they said when they asked him and he denied it , they 'd never been wrong before . He made sure before he left that someone could cover for him Monday if he was late or could n't make it . M OST OF THE GUYS at U Tech thought he was a pretty good worker . They 'd say , Y'know , Jay , you 're a pretty goddamn good worker . They also knew he was crazy . He was n't inclined to believe them . He did n't feel at all wild or out of control when he did the things he did . When he was five , he jumped off the roof of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was seventeen , he and Joey Fensterblau had driven Joey 's car off Pullman 's Landing . And when he was twenty-five , four years ago . he had climbed the roof of the main hangar during his lunch break in his first year on the job . Two years after that he was on his belly behind the forklift in Hangar 6 , just out of reach of the light drizzle slicking the helicopter pad , thirty-three yards away from him , and the 1111-52 warming up on it . He knew it was thirty-three yards because he had measured it . He 'd measured everything , including the time it would take for him to cross those thirty-three yards at top speed and the time it would take the HH-52 to get airborne and just out of reach from its first revving of the engines . He 'd figured out what the best day would be  --  Saturdaythe best weather conditions  --  rainy  --  and the best copter  --  the HH-52 with its massive , strong pods surrounding and supporting the landing gear , which would be his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's view . When the engines revved and the blades pitched he 'd counted one , two , three , four and broke for the ship , spattering across the gleaming blacktop and into the rotor wash , coming from diagonally behind the ship to avoid both pilot detection and the tail rotors , and leaping as the landing gear was lifting up , swaying away from him , catching one arm around the inside strut and pulling his other arm and legs quickly up and around , too . There 'd been no hesitation in the climb so he 'd known he was okay , and almost immediately the copter had banked out over the river that ran alongside the plant , and he 'd swung his legs down , looking past them to the water spinning away below , and let go , the noise of the rotors filling his ears all the way down . 0 NCE HE HAD DECIDED 011 Sunday , he asked Anne if she 'd go with him to the White Swan for dinner Saturday night ; they 'd get a sitter for Billy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She thought it was a wonderful idea and hugged him and looked up and kissed him , and when she appeared before him , ready to go , he thought her beauty must increase geometrically with her happiness . H E 'D FIRST THOUGHT of the runway idea on Christmas day , stuffing the wrapping paper from the presents into a big brown garbage hag , grinning at Billy 's fight with Theo over the Nerf football . Anne had been on the phone , in her blue nightgown with the tiny embroidery on the shoulders , saying , " Hi , Mom , Merry Christmas . They 're right here . Do you want to speak to them ? " and " They loved the presents . No , he 'll fit into them , " and he 'd got up , dressed , kissed her on the cheek as he went by , and gone out into the snow . He had known before he ever reached the runway that he would have to wait , because they would n't have had time to plow yet , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the flat , slightly drifting whiteness in the glare of the morning , judging where the center of the runway would be , and before turning back , he 'd lain down in it , sinking and looking up at the sky . UNDAY MORNING he did n't read the papers ; he played with Billy , playing catch down the length of the driveway , throwing him grounders , line drives , sinking pop-ups . He had drinks in the backyard with Anne and then helped her with supper . He helped Billy with his homework , played Scrabble with him over iced cranberry juice in the still warmth of the porch , and joined Anne in the den immediately after that to watch Moby Dick . When Gregory Peck nailed the gold coin to the masthead , he said he was going to take a look around , carried his cranberry glass to the sink , washed it out , and went out into the night , enjoying the summer smells and heading down the street at a good pace . A NNE HAD NEVER KNOWN about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been in the papers ( a UPI photographer there to cover a test flight had happened to get a shot of him on the way down , a tiny figure , grainy and blurred ; it had caused a minor sensation in the U Tech upper echelons ) . But she had known about the other things , including the hangar roof , and when she brought it up , wanting to understand more than anything else , and asked if he ever thought about her and Billy , about his job , he would only shrug and stroke her , stroke his way through her Why do you have to do it ? Why do you do these things ? and Are you sixteen years old ? He felt he loved her and wanted to protect her , so he had n't told her any more after that . He also did n't know how to explain without sounding as if he were refusing to explain it . E TOOK HIS TIME all the way down , listening carefully to the Sieberts ' dog , off in the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another dog answering , running his fingers over the link fence in tactile appreciation before slipping under it , hesitating at the top of the bluffs to survey the runway before leaning out over the slope and cantering down , in perfect control , digging his heels into the gravel and skirting bushes and larger stones . At the base he heard the rumble of something big , so he waited , and a four-engine Allegheny came thundering over the bluffs to the right of him , close enough so that he could see heads in the windows , and swept over the runway , the rear wheels slamming down with a tremendous , murderous screech , and , he estimated as he hurried toward the runway in its wake , right where he would momentarily be lying . He stopped at the edge of the runway , crouching , looking for any of the yellow security Jeeps , and then quickly crossed to the middle , immediately finding his old mark , measuring out from it , and setting his newone . He lay back on his elbows on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking up at the stars , and waited . Far off he could hear cars moving , beyond the tower on the other side of the airport , coming or going from the highway , and from that grew another buzzing . He jerked around , looking back for the tower . and caught in the gleam of one of its circling beams a Pilgrim Airlines twin-engine banking slowly around toward his strip . He lay back , trying to keep still , the plane circling gradually in the darkness , off to the left , disappearing beyond the bluff as it made its final gliding bank into the approach pattern , its engines still audible . He could feel them getting louder , higher in pitch , and as he watched the section of bluff hovering directly above his feet , waiting for the red and white lights to explode over it toward him , he seemed to feel it coming from the opposite direction as well , and he twisted around to see the headlights of the security Jeep down by the tower , bouncing along the shoulder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but then he hesitated , turned back to face the bluff , the Pilgrim 's engines roaring right behind it now , and lay back down . Then he saw Theo . He 'd picked up the movement in his peripheral vision , and he 'd just barely turned to face him when Theo 's front legs reached the runway , carrying him across it . His " Theo , get back ! " got caught in his mouth when he saw Billy pile out onto the runway too , slipping to his knees . He shot a look back toward the Jeep while trying to push Theo away , and Billy called " Dad ! What 're you doin ' ? " as he ran forward , but the last part was drowned out by the deafening roar of the Pilgrim twin-engine bursting over the bluffs . Billy froze , looking up at the huge , lighted dark shape swinging down toward him , screaming , perhaps ; Jay could n't hear . He grabbed Theo by the skin and hair of his neck and dove at Billy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprawling and skidding off the runway , and hitting Billy in the midsection and driving him hard onto the shoulder of the runway as the twin-engine hit behind them , the wing sweeping over , and was gone . The Jeep pulled up next to them , becoming audible only as the plane taxied farther down the runway , and they were all piled into it , even Theo , amid a barrage of questions , but it never occurred to him to try to answer . He was thinking about Anne , and concentrating on not letting go of Billy . ?
