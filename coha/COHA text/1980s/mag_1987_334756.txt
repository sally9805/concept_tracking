For an American in Paris or a Melanesian microchip maker in Minneapolis , the message from the Internal Revenue Service is the same : pay up ! The IRS announced a crackdown on American tax evaders living abroad and foreign-owned companies that are operating in the U.S. The Government says that it loses $2.3 billion a year because 61% of the 1.8 million Americans living abroad do not file returns . And an IRS survey of 12,000 foreign-owned U.S. corporations showed that up to 80% pay little or no tax . <P> The Government will soon have some new weapons to use against cross-border tax cheating . Starting next year , the State Department will give the IRS the names of all Americans who apply for or renew passports . Meanwhile , the IRS will be adding 25% more auditors , whose primary mission will be to examine the returns of foreign-owned businesses .
