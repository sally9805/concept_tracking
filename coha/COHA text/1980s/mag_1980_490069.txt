A R.EPOKTER . AT LAR.GE THE last stage of the primary contests for the Democratic Presidential nomination had , in what was already a strange political year , its own form of strangeness . It was not just that the outcome of the final primaries was in question ; it was also uncertain what that outcome would mean  --  whether , after the long , hitter struggle between Jimmy Carter and Edward Kennedy , the nomination would finally he settled . In addition , the fall campaign had backed into the primary campaign , presenting at times the picture of a free-for-all : Kennedy running against Carter ; Carter run  --  ning against Kennedy , Ronald Reagan , and John Anderson ; Reagan , appar  --  ently not at all displeased with Ander  --  son 's presence in the race , running against Carter ; and Anderson , of course , running against both Carter and Reagan . The final round of pri  --  maries offered Kennedy his only hope of keeping the nomination contest alive , for whatever purposes he had in mind , and presented others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their last chance to substitute some other nomi  --  nee for Carter . Carter was far ahead in the delegate count ; but more than a third of the number of delegates needed for the nomination remained to be chosen , and primaries were to be held in eight states , among them three of the nation 's largest , on the final date  --  Tuesday , June 3rd . The Ken  --  nedy people knew that it was impossi  --  ble for them to catch up mathemati  --  cally , but they  --  and some others 1980 : THE FINAL ROUND argued that there was a difference be  --  tween the " arithmetic " and the " psy  --  chology . " They argued that if Carter did not do well in the three big pri  --  maries  --  California , Ohio , and New Jersey ( how well he had to do in how many of these states depended on who was making the judgment ) ? this , on top of Carter 's defeats in other indus  --  trial states , might lead the Party to deny him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party nomi  --  nate someone other than Carter , or Kennedy , had been floating about . So , for all the Carter people 's professions of a lack of interest their insistence that the nomination contest was over and they were concentrating on the contest to come in the fall  --  they knew that they not only had to win some on the last Tuesday but to win well , so as to get on with raising money for the Party and preparing for the fall cam  --  paign . Meanwhile , a three-way contest between Carter , Reagan , and Ander  --  son was already under way . ON Thursday afternoon , May 22nd , Edward Kennedy is at the Martin Luther King , Jr. , Hospital in Watts . He arrived in Los Angeles yes  --  terday afternoon for this , his second  --  to-last campaign swing through Cali  --  fornia before the primary . ( He will make other stops here as he crisscrosses the country in the last days of the cam  --  paign . ) In a speech before an convention in Cincinnati yes  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would come in third in November , behind Reagan and Anderson . ( Anderson , who has met the requirements for getting on the ballot in every state whose deadline has come up since he announced he was considering an independent race , and who is planning suits in states with ear  --  lier deadlines , said in Los Angeles yes  --  terday that he is in the race to stay . " There 's no doubt in my mind . Sure I 'm in , Sure I 'm in . " ) Kennedy must do what he can now to get attention . He is relentlessly carrying on his cam  --  paign  --  his schedules are heavy , and there are few days off  --  which was widely dismissed as hopeless at several points this year , but the question is whether very many people are paying attention . He is followed by a press corps much diminished from earlier in the campaign , and several of the report  --  ers are along simply in case something dreadful should happen to him . Ken  --  nedy keeps pressing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer news . So he must take other tacks , like saying that Carter would come in third ( this to give Democrats pause ) or , as he did last week , chal  --  lenging Carter to debate him and say  --  ing that if , after a debate , Carter won a majority of all the votes on June 3rd , he would concede Carter the nomination . This was , of course , a no-lose proposition for Kennedy , but it also offered Carter a possibility of get  --  ting Kennedy to step aside . The White House , as was to be expected , dismissed the proposal out of hand . Carter was certainly no more likely to share the stage with Kennedy at this point than he was earlier in the year . ( In the con  --  servative counts , Car  --  ter is given between thirteen hundred and fourteen hundred dele  --  gates , and Kennedy be  --  tween seven hundred and eight hundred  --  sixteen hundred and sixty-six are needed for the nomination . ) The President 's political ad  --  visers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the race after the primaries are over , so that he wo n't take his campaign to the Convention . Three days ago , in what some Carter people had hoped would he part of this proc  --  ess , Carter visited his cam  --  paign headquarters and sug  --  gested to his people that they join him in extending a " healing and friendly hand " to their political op  --  ponents . But then , appar  --  ently unable to resist his own combative instincts , he suggested that Kennedy had waged a campaign of " false promises ... empty slogans ... distortions of issues . " Of the three big states up for grabs twelve days from now , California is considered Kennedy 's best bet . Among other things , Carter has never done well here , and has not built up much of a base in the state . According to some in the Carter camp , the President and Hamilton Jordan , his top political adviser , feel politically estranged from California , a feeling that no doubt contributes to the estrangement . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should make a trip to California before the primaries . The one state where Carter is scheduled to go , Ohio , is the one where he is con  --  sidered most likely to do well and where his campaign is making the greatest effort . Ohio is relatively con  --  servative in its politics , compared with the other large industrial states , and four years ago Carter carried it in the primary and in the general election . The race is considered very dose in both New Jersey and California . As of now , it seems inevitable that , whatever happens on June 3rd , the Party 's sys  --  tem of proportional representation will enable Carter to win enough delegates to get the nomination . But Kennedy is striving to make that only part of the equation . One of Kennedy 's problems is that so many people regard the contest as over that he must constantly explain why he is still bothering , and why the voters should still bother . Some Carter people maintain that history will show that the nomination was settled last month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so by less than a percentage point . Had the margin of victory been greater , they say , the chemistry of the rest of the contest would have been different . Kennedy 's strategy , after all , was based on win  --  ning in the industrial states , and his vic  --  tory in the New York primary on ? ? March 25th had thrown a fright into the Carter camp . Moreover , after the Pennsylvania primary and the Missouri caucuses , both of which occurred on April 22nd , the Carter people claimed that they had gained forty more dele  --  gates than Kennedy had . They also maintained that if , on the basis of in  --  tense campaigning in Pennsylvania , Kennedy could manage little better than a tie , he was not a very strong candidate even in the industrial states . Four days later , Kennedy won the Michigan caucuses , but by only one delegate . Carter then won a string of victories  --  in Texas , North Carolina , Indiana , and Tennessee  --  while Ken  --  nedy won only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there  --  fore it did n't affect the psychology of the contest , but it did affect the dele  --  gate count Last week , Carter carried Maryland and Nebraska  --  a Kennedy victory in Maryland had been consid  --  ered quite possible and earlier this week Carter carried Oregon . Next week , there will he contests in Ken  --  tucky , Idaho , Arkansas , and Nevada , all of which Carter is expected to car  --  ry . So Kennedy has not had a big vic  --  tory since the one in New York . One question , of course , is how Kennedy , who had done so well against Carter in the polls until he challenged him , got to this point . Some of Kenne  --  dy 's advisers think that his politicalfate was settled in the first month of the campaign . First  --  on the day the hostages were seized in Iran , and one year before the election  --  there was his unsuccessful interview on CBS , of which so much was made . In a few instances during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thought , and evasive about Chappaquiddick , and these were the impressions of him that lasted . Then there was the uncertain start of his campaign : the apparent lack of a clear rationale for his candi  --  dacy ; the difficulty of a sudden transi  --  tion , even for a Kennedy , from the Senate to a national , closely watched campaign . His tendency to stumble around at times in his campaign speeches then was made much of , as were his critical comments on the Shah of Iran . The theory of some of Kenne  --  dy 's associates is that this was the pe  --  riod when most people made up their minds about Kennedy . The polls showed him taking a nose dive during that time . The extent to which Chap  --  paquiddick was reexamined in the press , and the impact of that reexamination , came as a surprise to almost everyone . Chappaquiddick , plus the Kennedys ' marital troubles , developed  --  with the help of the Carter campaign , especially in its advertising  --  into the " character " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , believed all along that he should not run , because , as this man put it , " the American people will see him as someone who does not have his life together . " Peter Hart , Kennedy 's pollster , has a theory that the people do n't open what he terms " their win  --  dows " very often  --  that is , there are only certain times at which they make judgments . He thinks that the win  --  dows on Kennedy- were open in No  --  vember , and that it was difficult to change people 's impressions after that . According to this line of thinking , even when Carter 's competence came back into question in the public mind , when his handling of the crises in Iran and Afghanistan came under increas  --  ing criticism , and when the economic issue , which was supposed to he Ken  --  nedy 's strongest one , came to the fore , too many people had made up their minds about Kennedy . " People were not able to connect with him , " one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of his advisers say that his style did not help : that he came across on television as shouting ; that his way of attenuating words , in sarcasm , came across somehow as vaudeville , raising the question of whether he was a seri  --  ous man , and so did the nervous laugh with which he commented on his losses on Tuesday nights . According to a number of the people around him , Kennedy is well aware of the shouting problem and has tried to deal with it , but with limited success . He has a big voice , and it had long been a key part of his political style to arouse his audiences  --  sometimes even electrify them  --  with that voice . But the style did not serve him well on television , which tends to magnify . Kennedy 's old-fashioned oratory is ill suited to modern communication . Patrick Caddell , the President 's poll  --  ster , said to me recently that he thinks that even had it not been for Iran and Afghanistan , from which Carter was presumed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said that it would have been an even more slashing campaign than it has been , with Carter arguing , I 'm a moral man and you 're not , and Kennedy ar  --  guing , I 'm a leader and you 're an in  --  competent . Caddell believes that the personal aspects are more important to people than anything else when they make up their minds about the Presi  --  dency  --  that this is a phenomenon that was produced by Johnson and Nixon , and one from which Ford was the first to benefit and that the impact of the issues is minuscule . " Character will al  --  ways be first , " Caddell said , " and Car ter would have won on character . " Caddell pointed out wryly that the news has been so bad that surely his point has been proved . Some of the networks ' " exit polls " on primary days showed that Democrats favored Ken  --  nedy on the questions of who would handle the economy better and who was a better leader , but that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " trust , " they favored Caner . Another factor , which also had to do with these things but went beyond them , is that a great many people simply do n't like Kennedy . It is often forgotten that his brothers aroused a similar feeling , though perhaps not to the same degree . Of course , there are those who believe that Kennedy 's politics are all wrong for this period , but this hypothesis can  --  not be tested , given the other clouds on his campaign . And , of course , one can  --  not consider what happened to Ken  --  nedy in a vacuum : there was also the considerable skill with which the White House used the tools of incumbency . Today , Carter was in the state of Washington on an official trip to in  --  spect the damage caused by the erup  --  tion of Mount St. Helens . Rosalyen Caner was in Los Angeles this morn  --  ing and has gone on to Oakland . And now Kennedy , looking exhausted and uncomfortable , is in the Alberta King Child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sr. , ' s wife , who was murdered ) . Kennedy 's face is pale and blotchy ; his body seems chunkier than usual ; his suit is rumpled , and the lapel pocket is coming loose , and an  --  other jacket packet has been unart  --  fully mended ; the leather of his shoes is cracked and worn . Most campaign events are set pieces , but this one is a hit too stagy , and Kennedy does n't seem to know what to do ; of course , the young children , who are seated around low tables painting plaster-of  --  Paris objects , have n't a clue who he is . Kennedy wanders around for a while , talking quietly to the children ( " I 'm Ted " ) and admiring their work . Ken  --  nedy is actually very good with chil  --  dren . Then he sits down slowly  --  as if bothered by his chronic hack trouble and listens while the center is explained to him by some of its officials . He seems distracted at first , unable to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but then , when the officials show some nervousness about performing before the press , he seems to come to , and , the skilled politician , helps them out . Then he gives a little talk about the need for expanded child-care pro  --  grams . Following that , Kennedy goes out into a courtyard to address a crowd of hospital workers about the importance of " bringing health care into the com  --  munities " and of national health in  --  surance . Now he speaks strongly and firmly . He says , " I travel across this country and I hear those voices that say we ca n't do this , we ca n't provide decent health care , now is not the time to pass national health insurance . " And he tells the crowd , " I remember the letter that Martin Luther King sent from the Birmingham jail when he said ' Now is the time . ' " Then he says , " I wish Mr. Carter had come right here to the Martin Luther King Hospital , right out here on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the platform . " There 'd be room for us , right out here . " He points to the other side and then to his side . " He 'd he right over there , and I 'd he right over here . And we would ask him why it is that we in this country can not have a Pres  --  ident of the United States who 's com  --  mitted to provide a decent quality health care to the citizens of the na  --  tion . " He says , " I believe that the peo  --  ple of California are entitled to that kind of a dialogue and that kind of de  --  bate . Not only on health care but on all the other important issues . " IN a suite at the Biltmore Hotel , in downtown Los Angeles , Kennedy gives a series of television , radio , and newspaper interviews . It is an accepted rule of politics that California , because of its size , is a difficult state to organize politically , and that one campaigns there through " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do some ra  --  dio and television interviews , and late each afternoon does some more . Far more people are hearing these inter  --  views than are healing his speeches . Besides , this is a way to get free air time . Invariably , he is presented with the delegate count and asked why he is staying in the race . This afternoon , he answers that question as he usually does : " I wish the Carter-Mondale committee was as concerned about the rate of unemployment as they are about the delegate count . " Whenever possible , he gets in a line to the effect that " Mr. Carter ought to come to California and debate these issues . " He points out that he was willing to debate Carter when he himself was ahead in the polls , and that the President was will  --  ing to debate for a time after the hostages were seized . On November 6th , two days after the CBS program , the White House accepted the Des Moines Register 's invitation to de  --  bate , and withdrew on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ahead of Ken  --  nedy in the polls . Again and again , Kennedy points out in these interviews  --  and also in his appear  --  ances  --  that Hubert Hum  --  phrey debated George Mc  --  Govern ( in the California primary in 1972 ) , that Robert Kennedy debated Eugene McCarthy ( in the California primary in 1968 ) , and that John Ken nedy debated Lyndon Johnson ( at the Democratic Convention in 1960 ) . " I stand in that tradition , " he says . Now he says , " The people of Southern Cali  --  fornia have to make a decision whether they want four more years of Carter economic policies , " and he says that there have been twenty-five thousand jobs Lost in the Los Angeles area in the last month alone . He says , " The people here in California are entitled to listen to Mr. Carter explain to them why they have an inflation rate in the Los Angeles area of twenty-six per cent . And why he is asking for a ten-cents  --  a-gallon gasoline tax . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond to the questions of the people . " He says , " My candidacy speaks for those men and women who have been made unemployed . My candidacy speaks for the elderly people who to  --  day have worked a lifetime in the plants and factories of Los Angeles , now living on Social Security , and ca n't make ends meet . My candidacy speaks for the sixty-five hundred students in Los Angeles County that will not he able to get scholarship assistance be  --  cause of the reductions and the cut  --  backs this year . My candidacy speaks for the unemployed . Now , those indi  --  viduals and groups in our society are entitled to he heard . Their needs are entitled to be addressed . " He says that these problems ca n't be dealt with by speeches calling for Party unity  --  that if in 1968 Robert Kennedy and Eu  --  gene McCarthy had n't tried to change the Vietnam War policy the divisions within the Party would still he there , and that if in the late nineteen-forties Hubert Humphrey had n't brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still he there , and that " the serious economic challenges " the coun  --  try is facing can not be swept away by speeches about Party unity . In one in  --  terview , he says the Democratic Party can not afford to nominate a " pale car  --  bon copy " of Ronald Reagan . Asked about what he would do in the event he did not win enough delegates to justify continuing his campaign , he re  --  plies , " I learned many years ago from my father that if you start thinking about coming in second place , you 're not going to come in first place . " There is probably a great deal to this . The question of why Kennedy does not get out of the race has been raised repeatedly since he lost the Iowa precinct caucuses by a two-to-one mar  --  gin , in January . Kennedy and his ad  --  visers have more than once considered whether to fold the campaign . But it is not very difficult to understand why Kennedy is staying in . Among other things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  quite the contrary  --  or , probably , in his genes . Moreover , it appears that he really has come to be  --  lieve that he is , as his aides say , fighting for what he believes the Democratic Party should stand for . It is a more in  --  tense form of a fight that he and Car  --  ter have been engaged in for quite some time . This is not a scrap between a cooplc of old pols who realize that it is in part a game : it appears that Kennedy and Carter really dislike each other and what each thinks the other stands for  --  and that this dislike has deepened as the campaign has gone on . And though Kennedy does n't talk about it much  --  he has an abhorrence ( again the up  --  bringing , no doubt ) of appearing a " crybaby " ? it seems that he does resent the Carter campaign 's efforts to make such an issue of his " character . " So , hav  --  ing started the thing , Kennedy would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a hall or a gym to address a crowd there are people cheering him . The polls may show him being the choice of only thirty-odd per cent of the Democrats as of now , but that still means , to him , that there are millions and millions of people who feel that his candidacy is important . People with less to go on have satisfied themselves that their candidacies were important , that they were a voice . Moreover , who could say ? There was always the possibility  --  a possibility that kept failing to material  --  ize that somehow the bottom would fall out from under Carter . Kennedy has long since shown that he is a resilient man . Many people seem baffled that he has remained equable and good-humored as he has gone through this campaign , but those traits are deep in his nature , and they are also , it seems , part of his code of being a good sport . One of his aides says that there is an Irish fatalism to him . And given the other losses he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big thing . But , whatever happens , he seems deter  --  mined to live up to what he sees as his own obligation to family tradition , and to rescue what honor he can from the exercise . This will require some diffi  --  cult decisions down the line . Now , asked in one of the interviews whether if lie loses in California on June 3rd he will carry his candidacy to the Democratic Convention , he re  --  plies quickly , " Yes , I will , because I believe very deeply in the issues I 'm speaking to , " and he adds , " I think the struggle is over the heart and soul of the Democratic Party . " By now , Ken  --  nedy looks good . He seems to have or  --  ganized himself : the juices have started flowing , and he is focussed ; his com  --  plexion is its normal ruddy color , and the blotches have disappeared . He ends the last interview by saying , " The people of California can say they do not want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can clearly say is that they do n't want four more years of incompetency . And what they can clearly say is that they want America to regain control over its own destiny in our economy , in energy , and they want a restoration of American prestige and influence in the world . " EARLY tonight , Kennedy attend  --  ed a fund-raiser in East Los An  --  geles sponsored by Mexican-Americans . ( " The people in this country are en  --  titled to competency in the govern  --  ment , and they 're entitled to a commit  --  ment to the improvement of the qual  --  ity of life , " he told them . ) Now he speaks to students gathered in an audi  --  tori urn at U.C.L.A. Wearing his glasses , he reads his speech . It is a sober one and a tough one , indicting the Car  --  ter Administration 's record , offering some of his own solutions , including wage and price controls , and stating , " ' The issue of debate raises a question about the integrity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basis of the record , the positions , and the purposes of the candidates ? Or are we to grope toward that choice without knowing how the incumbent explains his past  --  or what he offers for the na  --  tion 's future ? What is at stake in 1980 is not just the character of the can  --  didates but the character of our poli  --  tics and our country . " He continues , " This election raises another question that transcends any specific issue : Do we still have faith in our own best im  --  pulses and ideals ? " He reads carefully and clearly , and he is applauded and mildly cheered from time to time , but he does n't get this audience worked up . Kennedy 's problem is that he gets an audience worked up when he gets worked up , and then he shouts ; to  --  night he is obviously trying not to do that . Though he knows it is a problem , he is inclined to shout when it is late at night and he is tired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resist work  --  ing up ; when he is subdued , so is his audience , as if it senses he is holding something back . Two days ago , in Newark , he gave a speech in which he spelled out a detailed plan for " the re-industrialization of America " ? for re  --  vitalizing the economy and improving productivity , through various incentives aimed at modernizing certain indus  --  tries . The idea of " reindustrialization " is coming into fashion , and is some  --  thing that California 's Governor Jer  --  ry Brown has talked about . ( Brown has not only dropped out of the Demo  --  cratic race  --  he seems to have disap  --  peared . ) Tonight , Kennedy gives Brown credit for the idea . As Kennedy responds to questions , he speaks with more feeling . He states one of his re  --  curring themes : " I believe a President can make a difference . I believe that Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy made a difference . And when Lyndon Johnson said ' We shall overcome , ' those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a powerful message that went all over this country , that this country was committed to the elimination of discrimination . " He says , " We have no magic solutions , but r do believe we can make meaningful progress on the basic questions of the quality of life in this country , and move this country closer to the ideal of eco  --  nomic democracy and social progress and social justice . And that is what I am committed to . " Kennedy seems to ac  --  tually believe what he is saying  --  a phe  --  nomenon that should nut be notewor  --  thy . At one point , he remarks that he and Carter come from different phi  --  losophies , and that is true . They are men of different temperaments and different outlooks , and they come from different political traditions . It is possi  --  ble that Kennedy really can not under  --  stand Carter . Carter 's way of handling the Presidency is antithetical to Ken  --  nedy 's view of how it should be han  --  dled . And the range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , say , McCarthy 's and Johnson 's or Robert Kennedy 's and Johnson 's . Kennedy says now , as he often does , " I 'm tired of listening to a President and to an Administration that wrings its hands and says no one can do any better . I come from a different tradi  --  tion . " Kennedy has broken out of the numbing approach he had at the be  --  ginning of his campaign , when all he seemed to have to say was that with him things would he better . He was critical then of Carter 's handling of economic and foreign policy , but his grenades did n't seem to land any  --  where . He redefined his approach after his devastating defeat in Iowa . The speech he gave at Georgetown Uni  --  versity in late January had its own problems , but it did mark Kennedy 's self-liberation . After that , he returned to the liberal Democratic politics with which he is comfortable , talking of hu  --  man needs and of programs to meet diem . He talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ogy  --  for example , " COET " ( crude-oil equalization tax ) ? with which few are familiar . He talks these days of his answer to inflation , offered in the Georgetown speech  --  of placing con  --  trols on prices , profits , dividends , in  --  terest rates , wages , and rents ? and says that while it may not be perfect , it is preferable to putting people out of work and slashing the budget for health , education , and housing . And now he has combined this with a sharp  --  ened definition of his difference with Carter on the subject of " leadership . " He does not talk so much about gaso  --  line rationing , the other major domestic proposal he made in his Georgetown speech . One of his aides explains that this is because the two proposals , added up , sounded like too much big gov  --  ernment . Kennedy says that he favors " moving toward " a balanced budget . And he says at U.C.L.A. tonight , " I favor strengthening our conventional forces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in im  --  pressing us with our own overkill . I favor a defense second to none . But I also favor a firm commitment to con  --  trol nuclear weapons before they con  --  sume the world in nuclear fire . " There is a sense of unreality about this campaign . It sometimes seems as if Kennedy were talking into a cave . The President may he highly visible on television- , but his physical absence from the campaign is almost palpable . Kennedy may reach out to jab at Carter , but it seems that he ca n't touch him . It is beyond the question of a debate . Of course , Carter has had to try to govern , and to take responsibility for his policies . But how would he have done if he had appeared before union members , campus audiences , ethnic groups , week after week , de  --  fending his record and answering ques  --  tions ? Like as not , he would have won , but the feel of the contest would have been different . We shall never know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faint aura of illegitimacy about the Carter candidacy  --  which could have been avoided . Out where the campaign is happening , it sometimes seems that it is n't happening at all . ON Friday , I have a conversation with Kennedy on the plane en route to Oakland and San Francisco . 1 ask him if he has found the cam  --  paign frustrating . " I 'm not interested in thinking back over the period of the campaign , " he replies . " There are ten days to go . There 's not really time to think about the campaign , not really a chance to think about that . I would hope that I 've henefitted from the experiences of the past . I 'm thinking now about the remaining days of the campaign . And then , after June , I 'll look to the fu  --  ture . " A politician in the midst of a race , like an athlete in a championship match , has to concentrate on the task it hand , ca n't afford to spend much time reflecting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and physi  --  cal energies can not he deflected . And Kennedy is not inclined to reflection or introspection in any event . I ask Kennedy how he thinks the President has been so successful in his a pp roach . " I think he 's been effective in con-hieing a significant segment of the Democratic Part ) that no President can make a difference today , and there  --  fore , no matter how had things get , it 's not his fault  --  nobody could have do nt better . He 's built on the previous e - perience of the American people  --  the Nixon period and the Ford period . People were n't called upon to do very much ; not much was expected of them . So that was the climate , the atmo  --  The re , in which the campaign started . I think he 's been able to convince a lot of Americans that no one can do better and no one has to be very much alarmed at the current challenges of our time . " " Do you think that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hr replies , " I 'm sure there are a lot of other factors that contributed to it . Raising my voice on TV and all kinds " ? he trails off -- - " of oth er things . Pm not as concerned about those matters , nor have I given much thought to them . I 'm sure I 'll have a time in my life -- hut not now . " I ask him how he will measure the imperatives for him after June 3rd  --  to keep going , or to stop in the name of Party unity . " I 'm sufficiently realistic to know that there are dates and events beyond June 3rd , " Kennedy replies . " But my energy and focus are on this period . There 'll be two months , plenty of time to consider the situation . But I 'm com  --  mitted to going to the Convention and making the effort for the nomina  --  tion . " There is no reason not to take him at his word at this point . Recent  --  ly , I asked one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased pressure on Kennedy after the pri maries to step aside and let the Party heal , Kennedy might not yield , and the associate said simply , " That is n't going to happen The divisions arc too deep . " Now I ask Kennedy if he cares whether Reagan or Carter is elected , if the choice comes to that . He replies , " I 'm thinking about my own situation . I 've spoken about what I consider to he the re  --  alities of the fall , If it 's Reagan and it 's Carter , it 's also going to he John Anderson , and f do n't think Carter can win under those cir  --  cumstances . I think the Party has to face up to what the central chal  --  lenges of the Party are . As I 've pointed out in my campaign , it is n't just a cam  --  paign , it 's a cause . That 's why I think the talk about unity without respond ing to these central questions is just empty . " Kennedy 's campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will be in the final stages of se  --  lecting delegates after June 3rd . They foresee great public-relations and psy  --  chological value if Kennedy is able to reverse some of the results of earlier stages of the process  --  as he did last month in Vermont . In March , on the same night that Kennedy was winning the Massachusetts primary , Carter won a nonbinding preferential primary in Vermont , which was of great public relations value to him . On April 22nd , in the town caucuses , Kennedy re ceived a majority of the delegates to the state convention , to be held tomor row . Some Kennedy aides say thci think Kennedy still believes that he has a chance to get the nomination : that if he does well enough on June 3rd the realization will sink in that Carter is quite weak and that the An derson candidacy could cost the Demo crats the election . Moreover , the Ken nedy people , like a great many others , expect that following the . Republican Convention , in July , which will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cal-ter in the polls . At that point , the thinking goes , there will he further doubt about the efficacy of nom inating Carter , even if technically he has enough delegates to win . The key test would he a vote on a rule that would hind the delegates to vote on the first ballot for the nominee to whom they are pledged . Since the candidates ' organizations arc involved in the selec tion of their own delegates , the Carter people say they believe that the risks of rebellion are minimal ; and in any event they have already begun a care ful process of making sure that their delegates stay committed . The Ken nedy people have begun to poke around for uncertain Carter delegates . The thought that Carter might he too weak a candidate , and also that Kennedy was unacceptable to too great a por tion of the Party , was what gave rise to the talk earlier this spring of nominating a third man . The names of Vice-President Walter Mondale , Edmund Mus kie , and Henry Jackson began to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get across the street in without someone 's comism of Carter , and found new adher  --  ents among the liberal elements of the Party as a result of his warnings against " overreacting " on Iran and Afghanistan . Yesterday , Jackson gave a speech in Chicago in which he said that because working people believed the Democratic Party had " reverted to the economic policies of Herbert Hoover , " Reagan might win in No  --  vember . When , in early May , Gover  --  nor Hugh Carey , of New York , called on both Carter and Kennedy to release their delegates and have an open Con  --  vention , few thought it a selfless act . There was some buzzing in the con  --  gressional cloakrooms about the possi  --  bility of a third man , hut nothing se  --  rious took form . The problem is that the sequence of events which would lead to the nomination of someone else would require concerted action on the part of a collection of Democrats  --  not a customary occurrence . More  --  over , elected officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then , people also considered that Carter is one of the most tenacious politicians in memory . At a press conference at the Oak  --  land airport , Kennedy talks about the effects on the Oakland area of the re  --  cession and Carter 's budget reductions , and about Carter 's refusal to come to California to debate the issues . A reporter tells Kennedy that yes  --  terday Mrs. Carter said in Oakland that in 1976 Kennedy had refused to debate his Republican challenger for the Senate . Kennedy replies that he did debate . " She was wrong ? " asks the reporter . " Yeeesss , " Kennedy replies , smiling . ( Later , I was told by people in the Carter campaign that they knew that the information given Mrs. Carter was incorrect . ) TT-IIS afternoon , Kennedy met with senior citizens at a housing project in a black section of Oakland and then went to San Francisco , where he gave more television and radio interviews and , this evening , attended a fund  --  raiser at the Empress of China Res @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visual , " the campaign arranged for Kennedy to be greeted by a Lion Dance , performed by some young Chi  --  nese , to the accompaniment of cymbals and drums , outside the restaurant , on Grant Avenue . As the dragonlike thing , with a blue , gold , and green head , wriggled about and the drums banged and the cymbals clanged , Ken  --  nedy looked puzzled and stroked his chin . Only about forty people turned up for the fund-raiser , but , despite the embarrassment , Kennedy managed to squeeze out some enthusiasm . ( How  --  ever disheartened a politician may be by the turnout for a fund-raiser , he must try to make it worthwhile for those who bothered to arrange it and those who paid to come . ) But tonight , at the United Irish Cultural Center , in the Sunset Dis  --  trict of San Francisco , Kennedy is given the kind of reception a politician dreams of , and of which there have been very few for him in this cam  --  paign . The hall is jammed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green  --  and-white sign says , in Gaelic , " A Hundred Thousand Welcomes . " As Kennedy enters , a hand strikes up , and a singing group called the Boys of the Old Brigade sings " The Boys of Wex  --  ford . " Kennedy , reaching the stage , joins in . Tonight , he forgets about the stricture not to shout , relaxes other campaign inhibitions ( he holds a baby during some of the singing ) , and sim  --  ply allows himself to have fun . The crowd , ecstatic , shouts , " NA:e want Ted ! " Kennedy , pleased , stands and claps and sings along as the Boys of the Old Brigade sing some other Irish songs . This is his kind of event  --  the kind that he got used to in Boston and that has eluded him this year . Irish labor and political leaders are on the stage . Joe O'Sullivan , a retired presi  --  dent of the San Francisco Building Trades Council , who arranged this event , is presented with an Irish Man of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one more time l " Kennedy roars gleefully as he begins his remarks . And as he goes through some introductions he turns to O'Sullivan from time to time and says , smiling , " How 'm I doing , Joe ? " or " Anybody who can do a rally like this , I 'll do whatever you say . " To the crowd , he says , " Being at a magnifi  --  cent Irish Cultural Center like this to  --  night makes me think it 's time to elect another Irishman as President of the United States . " The crowd cheers . " I want to know , are we going to play ' When Irish Eyes Are Smiling ' on June 3rd ? " he asks . The crowd wholeheartedly yells " Yes ! " " And I 'll tell you something , Joe , " Kennedy continues , shouting , his fist pounding the air . " It 's time we grew some shamrocks in the Rose Garden . " The crowd cheers again . And then he just lets go . His voice ringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe , that the Presidency of the United States can make an important difference . " He cries out , " We have a President now that does n't really believe that a Presi  --  dent of the United States or an in  --  dividual can make a difference . I re  --  ject that suggestion . That runs alien to everything that I believe , every  --  thing that I grew up with . I believe that individuals can make a difference , and anyone that doubts that ought to know Joe O'Sullivan . There are men and women like Joe O'Sullivan who are making a difference every day of their lives , to the young and to the old . There are schoolteachers in this room this evening . There are parents that are bringing up young families . There are people who are working with young children and with our senior citizens  --  all individuals that are making a differ  --  ence in the quality of life for the people of this great nation of ours . And I say to you that a President of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States can make a difference . We can read the history of this country and see it so clearly . Franklin Roosevelt made a difference when he pulled this country up by its bootstraps when it was facing the De  --  pression in the period of the nineteen-thirties . Harry Truman made a differ  --  ence when he converted us from a wartime economy to a peacetime econ  --  omy . John Kennedy made a differ  --  ence , Lyndon Johnson made a differ  --  ence . And Presidents of the United States , I believe , can make an impor  --  tant difference . " He talks about unem ? ? pinyment and inflation , and he pounds the lectern , saying , " I wish , my friends , that Jimmy Carter would come here to this hall tonight and de  --  bate those issues . Why wo n't he come to face the Democrats of California ? Why wo n't Jimmy Carter come to California ? What are you afraid of , Jimmy Carter ? " He works the crowd , shamelessly and successfully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be terrible television , but it 's as if he did n't care now : he 's having fun , they 're having fun , the hell with it . He concludes , " Are you going to be with me on June 3rd ? " The crowd roars " Yes ! " And then a woman sings " The Irish Soldier Laddie , " changing a line to " I will march with Kennedy , " and the crowd joins in . MONDAY , May 26th , Memorial Day . The San Bernardino County Fairgrounds , in Victorville , California , about seventy miles north  --  east of Los Angeles . Ronald Reagan is to attend the Western Deserts Gos  --  pel Sing here today . Victorville , sur  --  rounded by dry land containing mostly scrub brush and Joshua trees , is in what is known as the " high desert , " an elevated region of the Mojave Desert . From the fairgrounds one can see the San Bernardino Mountains , snow still covering some of the peaks The air is cool and clear . Victorville is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geles and Las Vegas , which is three hours away . This is con  --  sidered very conservative country old Western and heavily religious . Roy Rog  --  ers has a ranch , Happy Trails , near here , and there is a Roy Rogers museum in Victorville . There are a number of churches and gospel-singing groups in the area . On the fairgrounds , various gospel-singing groups are performing on various stages , families are picnicking , and in various booths people are purveying ribs , fried chicken , cotton candy , records and tapes of gospel singing , and Jesus bumper stickers . One be  --  gins to picture Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter competing for the " born again " vote next fall . Re  --  cently , Richard ' LVirthlin , Reagan 's pollster , said that Reagan expects to keep Carter from " cornering the market " on " born again " Protes  --  tants , who , Wirthlin said , constitute about a third of the population and are significant not only in the South but also in such important states as Ohio and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics , and many of the evangelical ministers who have radio or television programs have been speaking out for Reagan . While Reagan is here , Car  --  ter is visiting the U.S.S. Nimitz , the aircraft carrier from which the failed mission to rescue the hostages in Iran was launched , and which conveniently returned to port in Norfolk today . George Bush pulled out of the Re  --  publican race today , leaving Reagan the sole contender and therefore all but officially the nominee . Actually , Bush handily defeated Reagan in Michigan last Tuesday , and Bush and his aides had expected that such a victory would keep his campaign alive until the end . They were proud that out of a crowded field Bush had ended up in a two-man race with Reagan . Howard Baker , who had seemed so promising to so many , never really got his campaign going , and dropped out on March 5th . John Connally , having gambled nearly twelve million dollars and gained one delegate ( in Arkansas ) , was left like a beached whale after the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped out the following day . Robert Dole also dropped out in March , and Philip Crane dropped out in April . Bush was the only Republican other THE NEW YORKER 69 than Reagan to win any primaries . As in the case of the Kennedy campaign , sources of solace in a political race shift . After Bush won Iowa , he was all the rage . But he foundered in New Hampshire when Reagan , who had n't bothered to campaign much in Iowa , came on strong , and when people be  --  gan to get the impression that Bush had n't anything to say . Reagan 's polls indicate that Bush 's decline in New Hampshire began after the first Republican debate , not the second , more famous one , in Nashua . Bush 's staff now feels that it should have run " issue-oriented " advertising earlier in the course of the New Hampshire primary . It seemed that whenever Bush himself turned up on televi sion , he was talking about " momen tum . " Then Bush had some had breaks . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An  --  derson , who came in a dose second . Earlier this year , Bush aides told me they hoped to have Anderson out of the way by the time of Massachusetts . Bush 's people maintain that if Ander  --  son had not still been in the race , Bush would have won or come close to win  --  ning in Illinois , and would have won Wisconsin  --  and perhaps the nomina  --  tion . They say that they could have won in New Jersey and Ohio , and even done well in California . " Reagan did not have the nomination locked up , " says David Keene , Bush 's political director . Whether this is daydreaming or not , we 'll never know . Campaigns are filled with " what if " s . As it is , Bush came surprisingly close to Reagan in Texas and defeated him in Penn  --  sylvania . By that time , Bush had de  --  veloped a half-hour " Ask George Bush " format for television which was effective enough that even some Rea  --  gan people say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it earlier . Bush would have liked to stay around to the end , on the theory that ( 1 ) you never know , and ( 2 ) doing that well would stand him in good stead four years hence . Since he and his aides ex  --  pected the news of his Michigan victory to bring in the contributions to keep going , Bush was shocked when ABC and CBS , in their late-night elec  --  tion coverage , led with the fact that their projections showed Reagan with enough delegates to win the nomina  --  tion . The money did n't come in , and Bush , told the cold facts by his advisers this past weekend , decided very reluc tantly  --  to get out . He had been on the road almost constantly for a year and a half , and it is hard to stop . Reagan arrives at the fairgrounds shortly after noon and holds a press conference , in an open stable , to give his reaction to Bush 's withdrawal . Bales of hay , six deep , have been piled behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , commending Bush for being a " supe  --  rior campaigner , " and thanking him for " his expression of support for my candidacy . " Reagan looks ruddy and well . He is asked a few questions about his Vice-Presidential selection . He is n't saying , of course , even if he has an idea who it will be : the Vice-Presidential selection is the thing most likely to keep people interested in the Republi  --  can Convention . Then a reporter asks Reagan if he considers himself a horn-again Christian . Reagan shambles around a bit , saying , " Well , I know what many of those who use that term mean by it . But in my own situation it was not in the religion of the church that I was raised in , the Christian Church . But there you were baptized when you yourself decided that you were , as the Bible says , as the Bible puts it , that that is being born again . And so , it was , within the context of the Bible , yes , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how his campaign will change now that he has the nomination , he explains that though the schedule may let up some , he 's go  --  ing to press his campaign against Car  --  ter : " That 's the only person I 've been campaigning against in the campaign so far . " Because Reagan went after Carter rather than his feIlow-candi  --  dates , he will have an easier time finding the Party unity he wants . His candidacy has al  --  ready been blessed by his former rivals , and he is planning to at  --  tend a number of " unity dinners " in the coming weeks to help them pay off their campaign debts . He is also planning to meet with some news organizations in the East , in a clear attempt to per  --  suade them that he is a reasonable fellow . In January of 1979 , Senator Paul Laxalt , of Nevada , Reagan 's cam  --  paign chairman , arranged for Reagan to meet with just about every Repub  --  lican senator . " That allayed a lot of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so improbable to so many for so many years , is now the Repub  --  lican nominee His next task is to con-since as wide a range of people as pos  --  sible that he is not improbable ? -a task that the Carter people are already planning to make as difficult as possible . Reagan is asked what , after having tried for the nomination for so long and having almost got it four years ago , his emotions are now . " What are my emotions right now ? " Reagan replies He pauses . " You know , the honest answer is , I do n't think it 's quite sunk in yet . I 've been campaigning so long and so bard that it surprises myself . I have n't been fidgeting around , I 've been sitting quietly catching up with the news clip  --  pings on the plane . I think maybe someplace along the line later today I 'll go home all by myself and let out a loud yell . " On the stage at the rodeo field , Dale Wade , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wade and the Country Congregation , who has produced this event , announces that Reagan is about to arrive . " Tell him that Victorville loves him , " Dale Wade says . " Tell him that Jesus loves him . " The large crowd  --  about five thousand people  --  gathered in the bleachers cheers as Reagan arrives and takes a seat in a front row to watch the performance . Many in the crowd wave red-white-and-blue streamers . Dale Evans , on behalf of Roy Rogers , accepts an award . June Wade and the Country Congregation sing a song they dedicate to Reagan ? " ft 's a Long , Lonesome Walk to the Top of the Hill . " June Wade and the other wom  --  an in the group are wearing long white dresses . The stage is framed with pink , turquoise , and gold card  --  board , and a large wooden wagon wheel is at the rear . Written on the rim of the wagon wiled is " Western Des  --  erts Gospel Sing , " and Reagan 's name is at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Praise God , " introduces a num  --  ber of people , includ  --  ing the chairman of the board of his record company . Reagan sits with Miss Victorville , who is wearing a white suit and a tiara , and a man in an Abraham Lincoln costume . Reagan smiles , signs autographs , and applauds as June Wade 's group sings some more songs . Then Dale Wade intro  --  duces Reagan ( " a man I very much respect and admire for his Christian testimony and for what he stands for , no matter where he is " ) , and Reagan goes to the stage and is given a plaque , " in appreciation for your Christian tes  --  timony and recognition of gospel mu  --  sic . " Then Reagan gives an unusual speech . Referring to a line in the Get  --  tysburg Address , he says , " We are en  --  gaged in a great conflict to see whether that nation or any nation so conceived can long endure , " and goes on , " That is really what is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation can continue . This nation under God . " He talks , as he often does , about the " loss of confidence , a great concern and worry on the part of the American peo  --  ple . " He attributes the loss of confi  --  dence to inflation . lie cites " our lack of confidence with regard to the energy crisis " and the " doom-criers in the land who tell us that we will never again have things as good as we 've had them , that we must learn to live with scarci  --  ty . " He says , " I do n't believe that , " and he is applauded . He says , " I think that this country is hungry today for a spiritual revival  --  one nation , under God , indivisible , " and he is applauded . He says , " There are people in our land today who want to take ' In God We Trust ' off our money . I 've never known a time when it needed to be there more . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an urban-renewal plan or an area-redevel  --  opment program . " More than any political speaker one can think of , Reagan is fond of mak  --  ing his point through illustrative stories . The stories are sometimes quite long , and sometimes convoluted . He tells them vividly , and they have the ring of scenes in old-time movies . Now he tells of the Reverend Muhlenberg , a Revolutionary War minister , who was preaching a sermon . " A messenger came down the aisle and handed him a note . He stopped his sermon , and he opened the note and read it . And then his congregation was amazed to see him remove his ministerial robes and he was wearing the uniform of George Washington 's Army . And he said to his startled congregation , ' There is a time to preach and a time to fight . ' " Rea  --  gan says that lie has been " talking throughout the country about regain  --  ing our ability to defend ourselves . " He says , " Of the four wars that have taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this nation was too strong . We backed our way into the wars because some people thought there was nothing that we were willing to risk our lives for . " He cites the lead  --  er of the minutemen , who said in Lex  --  ington , " If they mean to have a war , Let it begin here . " And he asks , " Should he have said , ' Oh , no , let 's get out of the way , this is too much trouble ' ? " And then he says that Car  --  ter refers to the Vietnam War " as a time of moral poverty , " and he con  --  tinues , " When fifty thousand people , young Americans , give their lives to protect the people of a small country , a defenseless country , against godless Communist tyranny , I think it is an act of collective moral courage , not moral poverty . " ( This seems to he a change . Reagan often says in his speeches that there will be " no more Vietnams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that , he said he meant that " never again must this country ever ask young men to fight and die in a war we 're afraid to let them win , " and when I asked him if he was saying we should or should not have gone into it , he said , " I was one who never believed we should have gone in . " ) He says that he was reading some literature on the way here by " some of those organizations that think we should he more like the Soviet Union , that we should adopt more of their principles and so forth . " ( Reagan frequently be  --  gins a story by saying that he was just reading something or just talking to someone . ) Then he makes a reference to his military service during the Sec  --  ond World War . ( Reagan has written that he was disqualified for combat duty , because of nearsightedness , and was assigned to the 1st Motion Picture Unit of the Army Air Forces " to train combat camera crews , make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " When the gen  --  eral orders would come in , I 'd stick them under the blotter , so that at the end of the day when I had time I could read them . Because in them were always the citations for heroism and bravery . " And then he says that he read a news item about how the Soviet Union gave a medal to a Spaniard liv  --  ing in Moscow and he wondered why , and he found out that this man had lived in Cuba for a few years and had also been in jail in Mexico , and that " he was the man who buried the axe in the head of Leon Trotsky . " Then he says he remembers that the United States gave the Congressional Medal of Honor for an act he had read about during the war . " It was a B-17 com  --  ing back from a raid over Europe all shot up with anti-aircraft fire . The ball turret that hung , as some of us can re  --  member , under the belly of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball-turret gunner was wounded , they could n't get him out . And as they were coming over the Channel they were losing altitude , and the captain ordered Bail out . ' And as the men started to bail out , the wounded boy in the ball turret realized he was being left to go down with the plane . And understand  --  ably he cried out in terror . The last man to leave the plane saw the captain sit down on the floor , take his hand , and say , ' Never mind , son , we 'll ride it down together . ' A Congressional Med  --  al of Honor posthumously awarded to a man who was willing to give his life just to bring comfort for the few min  --  utes remaining in the life of a fellow-companion . " He says , " The contrast between the two governments is spelled out in what we give , or gave , our awards for : theirs for murder and ours for the greatest sacrifice that a man could make . " And he concludes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tered " in those dark days " of the Revo  --  lutionary War : " We have it in our power to begin the world over again . " And he adds , " We have it in our power , with God 's help , to continue doing just that . " As always , Reagan 's delivery is smooth ; his head is often slightly tilted to the side . His speech is an amalgam of Christianity and militarism  --  the preacher-soldier  --  and goes over well . TUESDAY , May 27th . Today , in the city of Industry , in the San Gabriel Valley , outside Los Angeles , Reagan returned to his more familiar speech . He praised the free-enterprise system and deplored government in  --  roads into it . He said that the federal government was created to do only three things : preserve order , protect the national security , and provide us with a stable currency . He said some of his familiar lines : " I believe the time has come for a turnaround in which we bring government hack down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YORKER get is " like protecting your virtue  --  you just have to learn to say no . " He pointed out chat he has been criticized for his call for a tax cut of thirty per cent over three years , and he continued to defend it . This is something that is being thrashed out among his advisers : some are more inclined toward a tra  --  ditional monetary and budget-balanc  --  ing approach . From talks with Reagan advisers , one gets the impression that they are reaching for a way to blend the two approaches . Some of his con  --  gressional supporters , who went around the country in 1978 pushing the Kemp-Roth thirty-per-cent-tax-cut idea and found that the public was skeptical , wish that Reagan would talk about budget cuts first , then tax cuts ; they think this would be more gen  --  erally accepted . Using an argument that Democrats used to make against Republicans , Reagan criticizes the Car  --  ter Administration for adopting " the old-fashioned course that you ca n't control inflation unless you create a recession and have unemployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does , of the energy problem , " The an  --  swer is very simple indeed : Get the government out of the energy industry and turn it loose again . " Some of his congressional advisers also wish that he would moderate that rhetoric . When I asked Reagan advisers at the Los An  --  geles headquarters today whether in the fall campaign Reagan would continue to say that there is more oil under the ground than has yet been extracted , as he did today ? " Geologists in that industry have told me that there is more oil and natural gas yet to be found than we have so far used , and I am inclined to believe that they are correct and that we 'd better get at the business of finding it " ? they replied that the Governor would offer " a broad energy program " for the fall . Reagan said today that the United States was reaching what the military terms a " window of vulnerability " to Soviet missiles , that he thought for the Soviets " it 's a window of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances might be faced with the choice of surrender or die . " He also said , " There will be no more Taiwans , no more Vietnams , no more betrayal of allies and friends . " Reagan has his lines and his anec  --  dotes down well now , and though he has shown , in debate and in response to reporters ' questions , that he can be spontaneous and deft , he chooses not to change what he says very much . He comes across as self-confident , and he is ? universally described as a nice man . He does have an Irish temper , some of his aides say , and can be quite impatient . Reagan does not come across as an extremist , in part because of his style , in part because he has the reputation of having been a moderate governor , and in part because many listeners have a tendency to assume that he does not really mean what he says  --  that much of it is said for effect . It is likely that , as people around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ed than he suggests , but to what ex  --  tent does he know this ? He does have an exploitative side , which the nice-guy demeanor smooths over . Every politician exploits people 's emotions , or tries to ; the question is , Which emo  --  tions , and to what degree ? Reagan picks at things that are bothering peo  --  ple , making them angry ; he talks in a soothing style , but he is not a sooth  --  ing force . When one talks with Reagan 's ad  --  visers , one gets the clear impression that there will be an attempt to have him give more thoughtful speeches in the fall campaign , presenting snore de  --  tailed domestic and foreign policies . They say that a different kind of cam  --  paign will be required from the one that earned him through the primaries . All sorts of lists of task forces and ad  --  visers have been drawn up , and all sorts of position papers are being writ  --  ten . But there 's no way of knowing yet which new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan . Some of Reagan 's advisers are uneasy about his sometimes loose use of " facts " and statistics  --  though they say that " the media " have made ? more of this than the public has  --  be  --  cause they fear that it contributes to a larger problem : an impression that Reagan may not have a clear grasp of what is going on in the world . One of Reagan 's advisers has told mu he realizes that it is going against Rea  --  gan 's nature to try to get him to stop using so many statistics . " He loves those numbers , " this man said . There is an attempt by some of Reagan 's ad  --  visers to liken him to Eisenhower . One of them suggested the similarity in a conversation today , and said that now , in a period of nostalgia , Eisenhower is enjoying a new fashion . Reagan , it seems , deliberately plays the politics of nostalgia , by harking back to the good old days , when things were simpler . The trick is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of touch . This is a more serious problem for him than his age . Reagan has taken to de  --  flecting the age question by joking about it . The advisers say that the stress in the fall campaign will he on Reagan as a competent manager , and that Rea  --  gan will offer his own ideas for man  --  aging the government . They say that they believe Carter 's record makes him very vulnerable , but they also expect the White House to make full use of incumbency , as it has against Ken  --  nedy , and to try to make Reagan the issue , as it has Kennedy . The Reagan people are obviously pleased with the presence of John Anderson in the race , and eager to paint him as a liberal ( just as the White House is eager to portray him as a conservative ) . One indication of how far ahead the Reagan people are thinking about the implications of Anderson came in the course of a con versation I had today with William Casey , the campaign director , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of seats in the House of Represen  --  tatives , and in which states , the Republicans would have to win in or  --  der to control a majority of the state delegations and thus be in a position to select the next President if the election should end up in the House . This afternoon , Reagan gave an in  --  dication of how much Anderson 's pres  --  ence means to him , and showed his deft touch , and also his sly side , when he was asked to respond to Jody Powell 's com  --  ment today that the President would not debate Anderson in the fall . Rea  --  gan was asked about this by reporters as he was entering a house in Pasadena where one of his precinct phone hanks is . " Of course , " Reagan said of the President , " he 's reluctant to debate within his own Party ! ' Then he got another lick in by saying , of Anderson , " I see no reason why , if there is a de  --  bate , he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked why he thinks Car  --  ter does n't want to debate Anderson , he replied , nonchalantly , " Maybe be  --  cause he thinks they might he appeal  --  ing to the same voters . " Reagan may have won the nomina  --  tion yesterday , but he acts as if nothing has happened . Today , Gerald Ford endorsed Reagan , and tonight , at a fund-raising dinner for California Re  --  publican legislators at the Beverly Hills Hotel , which Reagan and his wife , Nancy , are attending , a state senator announces that Reagan has just won Kentucky by eighty-three per cent , Idaho by eighty-four per cent , and Nevada by eighty-three per cent . Yet Reagan gives essentially his standard speech . He says that he remembers when the President " told us we had to give up the Panama Canal because he said no one would like us if we did n't . " He goes on , " I remember he has said we should have the SALT II treaty be  --  cause no one would like us if we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we tell him that we do n't care whether they like us or not . " He makes many of the same points he has been making fur months now . He has been speaking quietly , and the audience is attentive but not aroused . And then he says that it is time for the Republican Party to broaden its base , to reach out to " good solid blue-collar Democrats who will no longer follow their Party 's leader ? ship , " to " go into the minority neigh  --  borhoods and the ethnic neighborhoods , not as our opponents have gone into them over the years , insulting and de  --  meaning them , by offering only hand  --  outs , as if this was what was necessary to secure their support . " but " to go in and say , ' Look , we know that you want what everyone else wants : op  --  portunity , a chance at jobs for the fu  --  ture , a chance to educate your children , and raise them for a better life for them than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an indi  --  vidual sharing the same hopes and as  --  pirations that - all other Americans share . ' " He says , " And if we do that , I think we 'll find that a lot of voters that up until now the Democrats have taken for granted will be ours . " COLUMBUS , Ohio , May 29th . With the last primaries five days off , Carter is making his first avowed " po  --  litical " trip of the campaign . After the President , through a combination of design and accident , got himself into a policy of remaining in the White House as long as the hostages were held , the problem arose of how to get him out . His advisers believed that travel was necessary in order to nail down the nomination as firmly as possible , to have the President start explaining himself to the country and trying to rally it ( with a view to the fall ) , and also to get him hack to campaigning . They feared that he had become rusty . ( This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike athletes . ) To the President 's advisers , that breathtaking week in late April  --  in which there oc  --  curred the failed rescue mission , the resignation of Secretary of State Cyrus Vance , and the quick replacement of Vance by Edmund Muskie ( to divert attention from the raid and Vance ) ? seemed as good a time as any for the President to announce that he would now travel . People would he too dis  --  tracted to focus on any one thing , and there was an ostensible new con  --  text . The President 's explanation , at a White House hriefing for civic leaders that week , that the problems had become " manageable enough now for me to leave the White House , " caused his advisers some embarrassment and him  --  self some unnecessary crit  --  icism ; there were also problems when he ven  --  tured forth to Philadel  --  phia the following week and took some swipes at Vance . ( His remarks were a display of the mean streak that some of Carter 's aides had feared would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia was billed as " non  --  political " ? and thus came out of the government 's budget , as opposed to the campaign 's  --  hut , of course , the media in Philadelphia reach New Jersey , which has no major television stations . As it happened , the strategy behind the handling of the events after the raid worked . For one thing , the raid turned out to be popular , and helped the Presi  --  dent 's standing in the polls . Caddell says , " People wanted the President to do something , and something hap  --  pened . It 's that simple . It dissipated the growing anger and pressure over the crisis . It 's the one reason no one in the country cared whether Cyrus Vance was leaving  --  especially once Muskie was chosen . " One of the President 's advisers says , " Maybe one of this Ad  --  ministration 's greatest talents is its abil  --  ity to contain disaster . " After an extended internal debate , it was decided that the President would not campaign in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to run into budget problems . Fund raising has fallen short . A decision was made to reduce the Vice-President 's and the First Lady 's travel schedules and to increase the budget for advertising . The decision to stress advertising at the expense of campaigning was a con troversial one among those involved in campaign policy , some of whom felt that the advertising was essential ly negative , and that the President 's team , including the President , should he more active in campaigning and putting forward a positive case . In the first months , Carter 's spokesmen could go around the various states saying how much the Administration was doing for them , in terms of jobs and programs . Now , as a result of budget cuts and the recession , there was less to brag about . Iran and Afghanistan no longer worked in the President 's favor . There was internal disagree ment over how effective the campaign of Carter the person versus Kennedy the person continued to be . And some Carter people felt that Kennedy 's pounding away had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was decided that Carter would not go to Califor  --  nia was the fear that the trip might not he successful  --  because of Carter 's basic lack of popularity in the state , because of the political apathy that was believed to prevail there , and be  --  cause there was a fear of demonstra  --  tions . The Vice-President and Robert Strauss , chairman of the Carter/Mon  --  dale Presidential Committee , strongly urged the President to go , but the final judgment , shared by Powell , Jordan , and the President , was that it would be far worse to go and then lose the state than not to go and to lose it . Ohio was considered Carter 's best state ; Ohio was likely to give Carter a good reception ; and Ohio was , after all , the " heartland " of America and the state where Carter was most likely to prevent Kennedy from winning all three of the big states on June 3rd , thus denying him the argument that the only major industrial state the President had carried in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was likely to do best . Moreover , Ohio , which Carter carried against Ford , will be one of the crucial states in the fall . Already , a substantial amount of money has been put into advertising in Ohio  --  much of it for ads produced by Gerald Rafshoon , the President 's media adviser , showing " man in the street " interviews in which people make negative comments about Kennedy . Caddell argued that these were having a strong impact , and recently the Carter budget for Ohio was increased . As of a week ago , the Carter camp expected to win Ohio by eight to fifteen percentage points , and considered the two other big states close and hoped to win them . ( The Kenne  --  dy campaign , recognizing a probable loss in Ohio , is con  --  centrating the candidate 's time and its limited resources on New Jersey and Califor  --  nia . ) The Carter campaign strategy of spending a lot of money early in the hope of getting Kennedy out of the race did not work , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pile up enough delegates , did . The Carter people arc very im  --  patient with all the talk of how Carter must score a psychological as well as an arithmetical victory  --  and they blame the media for such talk  --  but now they feel that they must deal with it . One of the President 's strategists said to me recently , " The challenge early on was not to do it nicely but to do it at all . Now we want to do it nicely . " But once it was decided that the President would campaign , and where , there re  --  mained the question of what he would say . One of the President 's advisers said to me two weeks ago , " All of a sudden , everyone is talking about what we are going to say about a second term . " Here , in the middle of this Mid  --  western state , a rally is to he held for the President at a plaza in front of the Nationwide Insurance building at noon . Noon is a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Carter campaign has been working on this event for some time ; the day is hot and sunny , and a huge crowd has gathered . Carter is , after all , the President . Much has been made in the press of the fact that Reagan is holding a rally a few blocks away , and people commuting be  --  tween the two sites report that Carter 's crowd is larger . Some people in the crowd say that they are Republicans but have come to see the President . The plaza is good for giving a picture of a dense crowd , and the tall , modern building in back of it is decorated with bunting and a large American flag . Behind where the President will stand is a large green-and-white sign say  --  ing " Support President Carter . " The Presidential seal is on the lectern where he will speak . There are five bands here , and their music has been helping to build the crowd 's anticipation . An announcer tells the crowd , " Air Force One is safely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way right now , " and the crowd cheers . The announcer keeps telling the crowd what " an historic occasion " this is . Carter is no mere candidate : he is the President and the symbol of the Presidency , which obviously still counts for a lot . Just as the President arrives , red , white , and blue balloons are re  --  leased into the air  --  a sight that one associates with Richard Nixon and Re  --  publican Conventions . But this is ob  --  viously an excellent " visual " for to  --  night 's television programs . The Presi  --  dent is wearing a dark-blue suit and a white shirt . He looks good from a distance , but up close he has been looking pale and tired lately . He grins his wide grin and waves , palm out , in all directions to the crowd . This event has to make him feel good . Senator John Glenn , Democrat of Ohio , introduces Carter . ( Ohio 's other senator , Howard Metzenbatim , also a Democrat , is supporting Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kennedy family , endorsed Carter a week ago , after some pressure was brought on him to do so . Today , Glenn says that " there have been disappoint  --  ments " but that the people 's choice " has been very clearly expressed , " and it is " a time to close ranks . " Carter begins by saying , " I 've been waiting a long time for this moment . " He is applauded . He says , " And there is no place in the world I would rather he right now than in Columbus . Ohio . " He is applauded again . He thanks Ohioans for having provided him the primary victory in 1976 that insured his nomination , for putting him over the top at the 1976 Demo cratic Convention , and for making a difference in whether he or Ford won in 1976 . And he thanks them in ad vance for providing him a majority of the Democratic delegates next Tues day . ( This past Tuesday , Carter easily won the Kentucky , Arkansas , Idaho , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short of the sixteen hundred and sixty six that he needs . The Car ter camp claims that he has sixteen hundred and sixty two , and the Associated Press gives him fifteen hundred and eighty-four . ) Now Car ter launches into his argument ment about why he should be reelected . He cites Frank lin Roosevelt , who said that he would not campaign for his reelection in 1944 but would correct any errors that his opponents made about him and his Administration , and he says , " Although I will , of course , campaign this fall , now is a good time JUNE 2.3 , 1980 to set the record straight , not only about my own record but also about the strength and the achievement of the United States of America . " Then he asks the audience a series of ques  --  tions , to each of which he gives the an  --  swer : the United States . Which nation has the highest productivity per work  --  er ? ( This to offset the fact that pro  --  ductivity in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted elsewhere . Last year , the growth rate was negative . ) Which was the only ma  --  jor developed nation to meet the goal of reducing oil consumption by five per cent in 1979 ? ( The actual reduction was about two per cent ; five per cent is the amount by which consumption fell below anticipated consumption . ) Which nation had the greatest increase in industrial production ? Which na  --  tion added more than nine million new jobs in the last two and a half years ? ( This to offset the fact that unemploy  --  ment is rising  --  in the last three months , there has been an increase in unem  --  employment of almost a million people . Actually , the President slipped : his jobs figure , which he has referred to on other occasions , covers the last three and a half years . ) " Which nation is strongest and at peace ? The United States . " And then Carter gets to his main theme . " We do live in a time of challenge ; we do live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time of danger . But in every area of change , in every area of challenge , in every area of danger , because of our courage and strength , America is turning the tide . " His voice comes over loud on the amplifying system  --  he is pumping un  --  accustomed enthusiasm into his de  --  livery , as if he knows how important this debut is . The crowd reaction to the President is warm but not ex  --  ceptionally enthusiastic . In the course of his remarks , the President removes his jacket , and the crowd applauds . It may just be that he is hot , but he has shown that he is one of them . Using the phrase over and over , he says that " we 're turning the tide " in energy , on inflation , on interest rates , in foreign policy , in military strength . And , in what seems like the beginning of an attempt to portray Reagan in a certain light , Carter says , " As long as I 'm President , our nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for peace , " and his voice rings out as he repeats the phrase " for peace . " He says that the nation 's new energy plan it 's not clear what he 's referring to  --  is " more ambitious than the space program , the Marshall Plan , and the interstate highway system com  --  bined . " He says , " It will replace for  --  eign oil with American ingenuity and with Ohio coal . " ( A White House aide informs me later that the President was referring to the money that will accrue to the government from the windfall-profit tax over eleven years  --  two hun  --  dred and twenty-seven billion seven hundred million dollars . Congress has advised that sixty per cent of the mon  --  ey be used for income-tax reduction , and the rest for energy research and development , mass transit , energy as  --  sistance to low-income people , and so on , but none of that is binding . ) He says , " And I tell you flatly , with the perfect knowledge that if I make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make this prediction : that in the second half of this year , beginning in the summer , the inflation rate is going to go down , too , and you can count on it . " There is only a brief reference to Iran , and none at all to the hostages . He says that he realizes that not all the decisions he has made have been right or popular , and he says that they certainly have not all been easy ones . But , he says , " we have been tested under fire , we have never ducked nor hidden .... We have done what was right and we have a-ways told the truth . " Although Carter has done his share of shading the facts , the polls indicate that the people feel he is an honest man , and that is one of his political assets . He ends on a note of uplift : " As long as I 'm President , the government of the United States will be committed to those fundamen  --  tal principles that hold our ever-strong  --  er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and human rights . We 'll remain committed to the full promise of America  --  the land of equal justice , the land of full opportunity , and the land of liberty for all Ameri  --  cans . " After he concludes , he sits in the open back of his limousine , waving to the crowds , as the motorcade pulls away . The speech is actually a tryout , and the theme was not arrived at untilearlier this week . The problem was to find a speech that could be based on the record and could hold out some promise for the future , and would also be believable . A basic speech defending the record had been floating about , but the President 's aides felt that there was a need for something a little more positive , and for a rhetorical peg ; thus they arrived at " turning the tide . " Some of the President 's advisers wor  --  ried about the " credibility " of the Pres  --  ident 's message , and are not yet con  --  vinced that this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he were asking where Reagan gets off saying things are in such had shape , but Carter ends up saying that things are getting less bad than they had become under him . ( One of the President 's advisers remarked to me , " Our campaign has gone from ' Why Not the Best ? ' to ' It Could Be Worse . ' " ) While the White House was figur  --  ing out what the President could say , it was continuing to try to figure out how to get Kennedy out of the race . A committee has been established under Richard Moe , Vice-President Mondale 's chief of staff , to work on this problem . Yesterday , Mondale him  --  self called a Democratic senator who is close to Kennedy to suggest that the senator urge Kennedy not to prolong the fight . Strauss has been casting some lines out . The Carter camp wants peo  --  ple in Congress to point out to Ken  --  nedy that the longer he stays in , the more divided the Party will be , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House and the Senate who are running for reelection . The trick is how to bring pressure on Kennedy without bringing so much pressure that it stiffens his resistance . CLEVELAND . Following the rally in Columbus , the President spoke to a fund-raising luncheon there , gave some local interviews , and then flew to Cleveland . ( In Columbus , I encoun  --  tered Strauss outside the luncheon , and he said to me , of the rally , " That was good , was n't it ? I thought it was im  --  portant to bring the President some  --  where nice and safe . No way he would n't get a goddam good crowd here today . No way that wo n't look good tonight . No way they can make a negative out of it . It 'll be a positive . It 'll look good in New Jersey and California , too . We 've got eight states to look good in tonight . He 'll look much better than the boy Kennedy . Did you see the boy on TV this morn ing ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difference between a Presi dent 's campaign and anyone else 's . Air Force One is an impressive-looking plane . The President 's motorcade is very large , as is his staff contingent -- even when , for budget reasons , it is be  --  ing held down . The Presidential seal is on each lectern where he speaks . The logistics are smooth , and transcripts of the President 's public utterances are produced in no time . Now , shortly after five , the Pres  --  ident arrives at an auditorium in Par  --  ma , a town just outside Cleveland , for a meeting with senior citizens and community leaders . He came here as a candidate in 1976 . Parma is a heav  --  ily blue-collar , Eastern European com  --  community . To the extent that there is a race between Carter and Kennedy in Ohio , it is in this northern , industrial area , where the recession has hit . The southern part of the state is conserva  --  tive and more rural , and safe for Car  --  ter . Parma is being stied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At closer range , the Pres  --  ident 's face looks pasty , and there is a puffiness under his eyes . This auditori  --  um is quite warm , and lie frequently dabs his forehead with a handkerchief . ( Eventually , he removes his jacket again , and his shirt is wet. ) lie gives a condensed version of the speech he gave in Columbus , saying , " I thought , just in a short period of time , I would try to put the challenges that we face in perspective , because quite often in our great country there is too much of an overemphasis on the negative side of life . " With this audience , he stresses that " our nation is a nation of immi  --  grants . " He says , " We do have prob  --  lems . Our country has problems that we can handle . The challenges that face us today are not nearly so severe as the ones that have been faced in the past . " He says that more than a third of the budget goes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  fice of Management and Budget , the figure is about twenty-six per cent , and is arrived at by including , in addition to Social Security , Medicare , and so on , such things as public housing , veterans ' pensions , and retirement programs for federal workers and the military . ) He takes some questions from the audience . Rafshoon 's film crew is filming this scene , just as it filmed the rally in Co  --  lumbus , for use in forthcoming cam  --  paign ads  --  a practice that gives new meaning to the term " media event . " After a few questions , the President tells the audience , " As I look in your faces , it is an inspirational thing for me to know what you mean to our nation , and what our nation means to you .... We need have no fear of the future . In my judgment , the greatest nation on earth , with your heIp , will be even greater in the years to come . " No more talk about a " crisis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-indulgent , as he did in his famous " malaise " speech last July . ( Like other thematic innovations ? " the New Spir  --  it , " " the New Foundation " ? that one was quickly abandoned . ) CARTER 'S next appearance is at the Olivet Institutional Baptist Church , in a run-down black neigh  --  borhood on the east side of Cleveland . This place is a long way from Parma , in several respects . The church itself , a rectangular building , seems fairly new , and has white walls , blue-and-red glass windows , and pale wood panels on the stage . Awaiting Carter 's arrival , the choir on the stage is singing robust hymns . Then , on cue , it goes into " The Battle Hymn of the Republic , " and as it begins the chorus ? " Glory , glory , hallelujah ( " ? the President en  --  ters . He stands on the stage , his feet wide apart  --  a characteristic Carter stance  --  and joins in the singing . Raf  --  shoon 's crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the choir , filming the President and his audience . Carter then sits in one of the chairs on the stage . George Forbes , the president of the city council and a leader of this district , makes some remarks in Carter 's behalf . ( Louis Stokes , the congressman from this area , is for Kennedy . ) Then the Reverend Dr. Otis Moss , the pastor of the church , tells the audience of a recent trip he made to Washington , during which various black government of  --  ficials told him how much the Carter Administration had done for blacks . The pastor has been to the White House twice in the last two weeks . Carter greets the dig  --  nitaries and the audience : " Ladies and gentlemen , brothers and sisters . " He is applauded . Carter learned in Georgia how to speak in black churches , and he put that ability to good use four years ago . He re  --  minds the audience that he was at this church in 1976 . Tonight , he talks about " our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort Wayne , Indiana , early this morning . This is Carter 's first mention of Jordan in any of his appearances today . He says that just a few minutes ago he spoke on the phone to Jordan 's wife and his surgeon , and he asks for a moment of prayer for " our brother , Vernon Jordan . " He re  --  marks , offhandedly , that he believes the attack on Jordan was " an assassination effort . " ( At this point , there is no pub  --  lic information about what happened , and later in the evening Jody Powell tells reporters that the President has no additional information . ) He talks of his " close personal relationship " with Jor  --  dan . It is true that the two men have known each other a long time , hut , as Carter acknowledges here , they have also had serious , and public , disagree  --  ments about the Administration 's poli  --  cies toward blacks . Carter says that he was unable to see Dr. Moss the last time he was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state of Washington . ( " I flew over it , and I was impressed then with the power of God . " ) He quotes Martin Luther King , Jr. , and he says that when Moses led the people out of Egypt they did n't reach their destination immediately . " They turned against Moses . They be  --  gan to complain about the manna and the quail .... They forgot about the freedom that they had found , and they forgot about the slavery that they had escaped . " And then he says , " The American people , and particularly the black people , have not yet reached the promised land . But we are on the road toward the promised land . " And he is applauded . He talks about how much more the government is doing now for blacks than it was four years ago , re  --  peating as a refrain , " But we have n't yet reached the promised land . " He explains that the one new major do  --  mestic program the Administration is seeking would provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drop out of high school . ( The full funding would not occur un  --  til the fiscal year 1982 . ) He mentions the important black officials in his Administra  --  tion , and also mentions An  --  drew Young , who resigned under pressure . He says that he has appointed more black federal judges than all the previous Presi  --  dents put together . He says , " This is a time of controversy ... a time of challenge ... a time of impatience ... a time of inconvenience . But it is also a time of opportunity . " He says , " A President has got to face a lot of things : rampaging rivers , exploding volcanoes , Republicanism that might come back next November . " He says , " We never thought it would take this long to reach the promised land . " And he concludes by quoting the Bible .. And then , after addressing a large fund-raising dinner in Cleveland  --  at which he talks once again about the challenges and opportunities ; praises the United States for being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not di  --  vided , not trying to take advantage of other people " ) ; praises the progress that he says has been made on energy ; says that our alliances are stronger than ever ; points out that refugees are flee  --  ing to America , not from it ; and con  --  cludes , " We 've got the greatest nation on earth and it 's going to he even greater in the future " ? the President returns on Air Force One to Wash  --  ington . JUNE 3RD . Tonight , Carter wins enough delegates to give him the nomination . He has carried Ohio , and also West Virginia and Montana , But Kennedy has carried California , and also New Jersey and Rhode Island ( both of these states heavily ) , as well as South Dakota and New Mexico . Carter 's margin in Ohio and his lead in the delegate count are not as great as his campaign aides had been predicting . For Reagan , of course , the evening is just a formality , and we see him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and independents to join him in " unifying America . " ( To  --  night , the networks include John An  --  derson in their election roundup ; their exit polls showed substantial support for him , as have other recent polls . ) The Carters are shown at a victory rally in Washington , smiling but not looking very happy . The President tells his campaign workers , " I have one deep feeling in my heart , and that is thanksgiving to all of you who turned what eight months ago was a prediction of absolute defeat into a wondrous victory tonight . " There is that : his case was widely written off as hopeless when this all began . He says , " And I am now dedicated to bringing our Democratic Party back together , after we have faced two for  --  midable candidates who ran tremen  --  dous campaigns on their own , to reach out a hand of friendship and coopera  --  tion for them and their supporters . " And Kennedy is shown addressing the crowd at his Washington headquarters . Having had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jubilant . It has come to that . Kennedy speaks de  --  fiantly : " Today Democrats from coast to coast were unwilling to concede the nomination to Jimmy Carter . And neither am I ... We are determined to move on to victory at the Conven  --  tion and in the election next November . " ? ELIZABETH DREW
