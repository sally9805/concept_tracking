The thrill is gone-is it bad business or middle age ? <P> Is there hope ? This week , the J. Geils Band has settled itself onto the sunny , snowy peak of the Billboard chart . Score one for the good guys . J. Geils has managed to nudge off Foreigner , which on and off occupied the top slot for eleven weeks . Score eleven for the bad guys . And these days , in rock and in the record business , the bad guys are winning . <P> Big bucks , much media attention and even some good reviews go to a 598-page biography of Elvis Presley that is like a game of mumblety-peg played on a corpse . REO Speedwagon has moved more than 6 million copies of its latest record , thereby making Hi InFidelity the second largest selling album in the history of CBS Records . Rolling Stone , a magazine that was once the most prominent and articulate forum for rock culture , divests itself of much of its music coverage and aims for a more general readership . Record companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little money , mostly by kicking up prices . Punk is dead , New Wave is over , disco moved out when your older sister left home . The Clash ca n't swing a major hit single , so its albums do n't get high on the charts ; and does anyone know there 's a great new record by a great new group called the Blasters ? Is anyone listening ? Does anyone care ? <P> Wrote a song for ev ' ryone , Wrote a song for truth . Wrote a song for ev'ryone And I couldn ' t even talk to you . <P> - John Fogerty <P> Those days are over : days when a rocker had a right to expect that the music he made-like Fogerty and his peerless band , Creedence Clearwater Revival-could reach a large as well as a knowing audience ; when the radio played a dazzling diversity of music , not a range as thin as the air between two stations . For the first time , under the regency of radio programmers and the tyranny of marketing studies and demographics , rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smashed into a mass of splinters with few sharp edges . A song for everyone ? If it has no specific gravity to unite factions of the audience , then it has a shot . <P> Rolling Stone 's two-stepping toward general interest is a tacit editorial admission that rock music is no longer taken as the unifying force of a generation . The eager reception of Albert Goldman 's lowlife Presley biography ( 150,000 sold ) is an indication that there is an audience that wants , even needs , to have the rock spirit despoiled . That spirit can find nothing new to focus on , never mind to rally around . Social issues have always been slightly suspect in rock . But the upheavals of the 1960s , like Viet Nam and civil rights , redirected and rejustified rock by setting it within a more urgent social context : suddenly there were new subjects to explore , fresh issues for the music to explain , ideas that the rock culture itself could symbolize . That sense of unlimited possibility died in the next decade . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Critic Greil Marcus has said , " but because it had no way of linking up to grand mythic dimensions , it lacked the charge much inferior music had some years earlier .
