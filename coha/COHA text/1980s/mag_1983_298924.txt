But George Orwell 's message for 1984 is bigger than Big Brother <P> He thought it was " a good idea ruined , " that futuristic fable he had planned on calling The Last Man in Europe . But he was always pessimistic about his own writing . This time the gloom was deepened by illness . His tuberculosis had worsened . The task of typing and revising the manuscript had broken him physically . He lay in a sanatorium bed when his book was published , in June 1949 ; the name that appeared on its cover was Nineteen Eighty-Four . <P> Come Jan. 1 , the fictional date of George Orwell 's final and most famous book becomes fact at last . It is a looking-glass anniversary , a remembrance of things future , and an accidental one at that . Orwell 's manuscript , which has just resurfaced after years in a private collection , reveals that the author had considered both 1980 and 1982 for the time of his story . So what is about to happen might have occurred two or four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to The Last Man in Europe , there would have been no occasion to commemorate . <P> Tens of millions have read it , in 62 languages : the story of Winston Smith , a minor bureaucrat in the totalitarian state of Oceania . War with the world 's two other superpowers , Eurasia and Eastasia , is constant , although the pattern of hostilities and alliances keeps changing . Smith works at the Ministry of Truth , rewriting old newspaper stories to conform to current Party ideology . He uses the official language , Newspeak , a version of English being pared down to make unorthodox opinions impossible to conceive . Privacy has vanished . Waking and sleeping , Smith and all Party members are observed by two-way telescreens ; posters everywhere proclaim BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU . Suddenly , Smith commits a thoughtcrime : " Down with Big Brother . " He also begins a love affair with Julia , a co-worker at his office , another heinous offense . The Junior Anti-Sex League indoctrinates the virtue of celibacy ; procreation will soon be carried on solely through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All personal loyalty belongs to the Party . Winston and Julia are caught by the Thought Police and hauled off to the Ministry of Love . He is relentlessly tortured , then taken to Room 101 , where his worst fear has been readied by interrogators . As a cage bearing a rat is being pushed toward his face , he begs that this punishment be inflicted on Julia instead . This betrayal eliminates the last trace of his integrity . He has become a good Party Member . <P> For all its readers , for the countless millions who have heard of Big Brother and the estimated year of his arrival , this New Year 's Day offers some unsettling moments : that glimpse of the new calendar , the first chance to write 1984 in a diary or on a letter or check . Orwell spelled his title out , a practice followed in the first editions : the book had a name , like Utopia or Leviathan , not a date . But the shorthand 1984 also gained wide currency . And those four neutral integers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shimmering , brutal power of the hieroglyph.
