NEW YORK  --  Marketing experts and advertising executives were split in their appraisals of the reincarnation of old Coke as Coca-Cola classic , calling it everything from a brilliant move to an admission of failure . Coca-Cola Co. ' s greatest challenge now will be to create distinct and appealing personalities for the two brands through advertising . When the company announced its reformulation last April , it insisted that its flagship soft drink was still " the real thing " and even brought back a commercial jingle from 1971 to try to prove it . But now , there doesn ' t seem to be a single " real thing . " " They can ' t say ' Coke is it ' anymore because Coke has become a many splendored thing , " says Morgan Hunter , vice chairman of Marketing Corp. of America in Westport , Conn . " What does that brand stand for now ? From an advertising standpoint , Pepsi can dip Coke ' s face in the mud . " Some marketing consultants predict that Coca-Cola may have trouble getting shelf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement comes as retailers are trying to cope with a slew of new soft drinks , ranging from PepsiCo Inc. ' s new Slice drink with fruit juice to Coca-Cola ' s own Cherry Coke brand . " Coke is one of the few marketers powerful enough to pull off an old Coke-new Coke strategy , " says Al Meyers , senior consulting associate at Management Horizons Inc. , a marketing research and management consulting firm . " But I believe many supermarket buyers will choose either the new Coke or old Coke . And most probably will opt for old Coke . " But other experts on soft-drink marketing believe Coca-Cola has a major opportunity to squeeze Pepsi by offering consumers a sweeter blander-tasting Coke as well as the harsher-tasting original formula . " It ' s a brilliant line extension , except that the company had the guts to pull the original product off the market and use it as the extension , " says Leo Shapiro , a Chicago-based market researcher . In May and June , he conducted a survey and found that 59% of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while 25% favored Pepsi . Only 13% voted for new Coke . Bill Backer , president of the Backer &; Spielvogel ad agency , believes Coke may price its classic product slightly higher than the reformulated version . " I think the market would pay for it , " he says . Mr. Backer , who was responsible for some of Coke ' s most memorable advertising during a stint at the McCann-Erickson ad agency , says he suggested the Coke classic strategy to Coke executives one day after the company announced the new recipe last spring . " If they do it right , I think it ' s a fabulous opportunity , " he says . " Classic can be for the older market and the new Coke for kids . " He compared it to marketing regular and light versions of cigarettes . Executives at Coke ' s ad agency , McCann-Erickson , weren ' t available for comment on the classic brand . But ad agencies for competing brands were jubilant about what they called the marketing blunder of the decade . " This will keep alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their options , " says Bob Weekes , executive vice president at Dancer Fitzgerald Sample , the agency for RC Cola , made by Royal Crown Cola Co . " We can ' t afford to buy the kind of publicity Coke gives us . " Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
