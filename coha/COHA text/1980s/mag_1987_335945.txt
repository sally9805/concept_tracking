Like a team of climbers nearing the top of a steep and dangerous mountain face , Western Europe 's economies are beginning to show signs of fatigue . Though still pressing onward and upward , they face perilous obstacles , most notably the weak dollar . While Britain , Italy and Spain are still moving forward at a relatively brisk rate , such countries as West Germany , France and Sweden are faltering . And just as climbers roped together for safety can progress only at the pace of the slowest team member , growth is now being threatened by the economic laggards . <P> Such was the picture that emerged from a meeting last month of TIME 's European Board of Economists , held at Interlaken , in the shadow of the Swiss Alps . If all goes well , the economists said , Europe 's five-year-old expansion could last at least through 1988 and the average growth rate of the major nations could be maintained in the current 2.5% range . TIME 's board acknowledged , though , that dangers are looming and that pessimism is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mast , senior economic adviser to the Credit Suisse First Boston investment bank : " In today 's climate of high real interest rates , Third World difficulties , heavy corporate debt and increased protectionism , many businessmen now share the view that a financial and economic collapse is a possibility . " <P> Even a mild slowdown in Europe 's growth rate would be bad news for the U.S. economy . Washington has been counting on increased exports to Europe to help curb America 's huge trade deficit , which hit a record $169 billion in 1986 . But there is no assurance that Western Europe can keep up its present consumption of American imports ( $59 billion last year ) , much less develop a greater appetite . <P> Blocking the path to robust European growth is the low value of the dollar . Despite recent gains , the U.S. currency is still down more than 40% against the West German mark and the French franc since early 1985 . That decline has damaged many of Europe 's export-driven economies by making their products more expensive in relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Germany , whose GNP actually declined at a .5% annual rate in the first quarter of the year . Nonetheless , Herbert Giersch , an economist at the University of Kiel , predicted that more stimulative government policies would push the growth rate to 2% for 1987 as a whole . The outlook may be bleaker for France , which is heavily dependent on such exports as aircraft and telecommunications equipment . Said Economics Professor Jean-Marie Chevalier , of the University of Paris Nord , who predicted a 1.3% growth rate this year for his country : " There is now a mood of melancholy , anxiety and uncertainty about France 's economic prospects . " <P> A serious impediment to European expansion is the high level of interest rates . In Sweden , where GNP growth is expected to be only 1.5% this year , the interest rate charged by banks to prime corporate customers can be as high as 11.5% , compared with the 8.25% levied on similar loans in the U.S. Nils Lundgren , vice president of Pkbanken , a major Swedish bank , argued that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ globe because Washington must borrow so much money abroad to help finance the federal budget deficit ( $221 billion last year ) . Said Lundgren : " The U.S. is using up the savings of the world . "
