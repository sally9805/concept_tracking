Defaults on tax-exempt municipal bonds like those issued on Whoops have been relatively infrequent and have usually involved smallish sums . Only 685 defaults have occurred since 1940 , out of 301,016 municipal bond issues . In terms of money lost , each of the three largest were around one-twentieth the size of last week 's fizzle . The West Virginia Turnpike Commission defaulted on $133 million in bonds in 1958 . Chicago 's Calumet Skyway collapsed under bond indebtedness of $101 million in 1963 , and investors were short-changed in 1978 when the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Tunnel Commission reneged on $100 million worth of bonds . <P> New York City 's near miss in 1975 does not count as a default , at least technically , because the city secured moratoriums on short-term interest payments until it could again start paying its creditors . If the Big Apple had defaulted , it would have been slightly ahead of Whoops ' record , at $2.4 billion . <P> Until the Whoops debacle , the biggest bond defaults had come in the private sector . The Penn Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into what remains America 's biggest bankruptcy : $3 billion in liabilites , including $1 billion worth of bonds . <P> Foreign bonds are riskier because it is difficult to force payment or arrange settlements . The Wall Street firm Carl Marks &; Co. is still fighting a class-action suit against the People 's Republic of China to recover losses from Hukuang Railroad bonds issued by the imperial Chinese government in 1911 . Last year a U.S. district court in Alabama ordered China to cough up to U.S. bondholders the unpaid principal plus the interest that has been mounting at 5% annually , a total of $41.3 million . Marks also has two suits against the Soviet Union involving $75 million in dollar-denominated bonds issued by the imperial Russian government . The bonds , held by U.S. investors , were repudiated by Moscow after the 1917 revolution . Daniel Collier , a Marks vice president , is not holding his breath . In his firm 's offices , one of the Russian bonds is mounted , with a small hammer beside it , along with the words : IN CASE OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions fail , some of the paper still has value . A Hukuang Railroad bond for 20 gold pounds ( $96 ) that is in good condition is worth from $50 to $100 as a collector 's item .
