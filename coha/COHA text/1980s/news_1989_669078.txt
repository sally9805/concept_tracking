Lou Henson put the finishing touches on his backcourt of the future Tuesday when Rennie Clemons of Springfield Calvary Academy signed a letter of intent with Illinois . The 6-foot Clemens , regarded as one of the top point-guard prospects in the country , will join 6-4 Jamie Brandon of King and 6-4 T.J. Wheeler of Christopher next season in the Illini backcourt . Brandon , one of the top 10 prospects in the country , and Wheeler , a two-time Class A all-state pick , signed last Wednesday , the beginning of the eight-day early-signing period . As a group , they are more highly regarded coming out of high school than were current senior guards Kendall Gill , Steve Bardo and Larry Smith , but they ' ll have to prove it in college . Clemons chose Illinois over Bradley on Sunday after his official visit to Champaign . He announced his choice at school late Tuesday afternoon in front of an audience that included cameras from three TV stations . " Illinois has always been in my mind , I just wasn ' t sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my way back . I like everything about it-the atmosphere , the tradition , just everything . Plus it ' s close to home . " Clemons scored 32. 4 points a game last season , but Calvary coach Jim Drew believes that scoring will be the least of his early contributions to the Illini . " In my opinion , they are getting one of the top point guards in America , " Drew said . " I told Lou he ' ll walk in and be able to do two things right away . One is play defense on any guard in the Big 10 right away , and two , be the best ballhandler on the floor . He ' s a magician with the ball . The scoring will come later . " Brandon and Clemons will face each other Dec. 15 when King plays at Calvary Academy. - Star time : St. Louis-area basketball fans will get a chance to see 6-7 Anfernee Hardaway , regarded by some scouts as the top high school player in the country , in the Coca-Cola/KMOX Shootout Dec. 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State last week , will lead Memphis Treadwell against St. Louis Vashon during a four-game evening session .

Kicking from 1983 to 1986 , John Duvic became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mike Duvic last weekend set three NCAA Division III records at Dayton , including most points via kicking in a season ( 79 ) and best regular-season career field-goal percentage ( . 776 on 38-of-49 accuracy ) . Tim has made 7 of 11 field-goal attempts each of the last two seasons , including a 52-yarder this year . John and Tim did all their kicking for Benet . Because of a temporary family move to Ohio , Mike did his varsity kicking for Columbus Bishop Watterson . " I used to shag balls for them , " Tim said of his older brothers . " Then I ' d kick a few . We basically all started kicking and liked it . John was pretty successful in college , and we all kind of followed .
