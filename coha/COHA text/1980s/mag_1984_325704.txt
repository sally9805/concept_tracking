Terrorists increase pressure on the U.S. to leave Lebanon <P> Hardly a government in the Arab world does not contain at least one Cabinet minister who is a graduate of the 117-year-old American University of Beirut . Despite nearly a decade of civil war and continuing turmoil , the university has remained a bulwark of learning and an island of relative tranquillity in a scarred and anguished city . Last week it also became a monument to the senseless terror that besets all Lebanon . Its president , Malcolm Kerr , 52 , whose life had been devoted to Arab culture and education , was shot dead by two unknown gunmen , apparently for no reason except that he was an American . <P> Shortly afterward , an anonymous caller telephoned the French news agency Agence France-Presse and said that the assassination of Kerr had been carried out by members of the Islamic Jihad , the same Iranian-backed Shi'ite Muslim group that is believed to have bombed the U.S. and French military headquarters in Beirut last October as well as the Israeli headquarters in Tyre . The caller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military presence in Beirut , " and vowed that " not a single American or Frenchman will remain on this soil . " <P> The caller also said that the Islamic Jihad had been responsible for the Beirut kidnaping of the Saudi consul general , Hussein Farrash , a day earlier . Farrash , 45 , had been abducted by seven gunmen who intercepted his limousine as he was driving to work . According to the anonymous message , the diplomat would be tried according to Islamic law , executed , and his body would be " thrown out .

But Saudi Arabia bankrolls Syria to the tune of $1 billion a year , and Saudi diplomats have frequently acted as mediators in intra-Arab disputes . In tacit recognition of their status , Saudi diplomats had been exempt from the terror that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the week passed , there was no further word on Farrash 's fate . <P> In targeting Kerr for assassination , the killers chose a man who had spent much of his life promoting trust and friendship between the West and the Arab world . Kerr was born in Beirut , the son of an American biochemistry professor at the university . He studied there and at Johns Hopkins University 's School of Advanced International Studies . Later he taught political science for 20 years at the University of California at Los Angeles . But Kerr always dreamed of returning to <P> Lebanon to lead the institution that had been so much a part of his heritage , and in late 1982 he got his wish when he was named president of the American University . His immediate predecessor , Acting President David Dodge , had been kidnaped by Muslim extremists in July , with the evident backing of both Syria and Iran . Dodge was finally released in July 1983 , thanks largely to efforts by Syrian President Hafez Assad 's brother Rifaat , head of the Syrian internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
