Ever since Andrew Jackson led a revolt against big banks and the East Coast oligarchy , populism has been a powerful strand in American politics . The clash between those who represent entrenched power and those who resent it has rivaled the tension between liberalism and conservatism in defining American campaign showdowns . Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter , like many of their predecessors , rode to power by tapping the electorate 's anti-Establishment streak . <P> At first blush it would seem difficult for most of the class of ' 88 to cultivate such furrows of frustration . George Bush , Robert Dole , Richard Gephardt , Michael Dukakis , Albert Gore and Paul Simon have all made their names by being competent insiders . Yet almost every candidate , with the exception of Bush ( who with his pedigree paternity and Washington resume virtually embodies the Establishment ) , is now trying to mine a populist vein . <P> Left-wing populism stresses economic resentments . For Jesse Jackson , such sentiments come naturally . He decries the " economic violence " imposed on workers and small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing populism reflects cultural alienation , the sense that liberal elitists have forced their social views on a more traditional majority . Although Pat Robertson 's campaign ads brag about his well-established roots ( " descendant of two U.S. Presidents " ) , his success comes from tapping resentments that fed other conservative populist campaigns , including Reagan 's . <P> Dole has tried to pluck both the economic and cultural strings of populism . He preaches that the G.O.P. must show more " sensitivity " and " compassion " for society 's have-nots . Contrasting himself with the patrician Bush , Dole emphasizes his humble background . He says he wants Iowans to recognize that " Bob Dole is one of us . " Bush 's demand that Dole release his tax returns , so as to display his affluence , was an attempt to dull Dole 's populist luster . <P> Gephardt , once rightly proud of his status as a key Washington insider , has become the Democrat most determined to play the populist card . In speeches and commercials , he has designed the finale of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . " In one recent speech , Gephardt castigated the " Establishment " in 21 different allusions with a common thread : " The Establishment is separated from the consequences of its own opinions . " His tough stance on foreign trade appeals to a nativist streak that is an undercurrent of populism . Bruce Babbitt 's best applause comes when he denounces corporate executives who get large bonuses while cutting workers ' benefits . He has called IBP meat-packers , one of Iowa 's most antiunion companies , a " corporate outlaw . " All the other Democrats soon followed suit . Gary Hart 's new slogan  --  " Let the people decide "  --  also strikes an anti- Establishment chord . <P> One reason for populism 's appeal in 1988 is that the economic recovery of the Reagan years has been uneven . The October crash followed a long period of Washington scandals and Wall Street abuses that heightened animosities toward big shots of all varieties . In a comprehensive survey , the Times-Mirror Co. found 77% agreeing with the statement " There is too much power concentrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
