Three convicted , four acquitted <P> The three-week trial in Dallas of seven New Orleans police officers for violating the civil rights of four witnesses under interrogation would have set any jury 's heads spinning . The prosecution laid out allegations of almost gestapo-style brutality ; the defense countered with a description of police behavior that approached textbook perfection . Last week the jury in effect delivered a split judgment . While they found four officers innocent of all charges , they said three were guilty of both conspiracy , a felony , and beating a black witness under interrogation , a misdemeanor . <P> The case began on Nov. 8,1980 , when a white police officer , Gregory Neupert , 23 , was found dead , shot in the neck in a predominantly black neighborhood of the Algiers section of New Orleans . The police mounted a furious probe , in the course of which four blacks were killed by investigators under circumstances that are still not entirely clear . Then Police Superintendent James Parsons resigned . Grand juries were convened to investigate the killings and consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to obtain leads and evidence in the Neupert case . <P> In July 1981 , a federal grand jury in New Orleans voted indictments of seven officers . Last month in Dallas , where the trial had been moved on a federal judge 's orders , two former Algiers residents , Robert Lee Davis , 20 , and Johnny Brownlee , 23 , told of being handcuffed , then beaten by New Orleans police with a hardback city directory ; of being suffocated with a plastic bag ; and of being taken out to a wooden bridge over a levee and having a shotgun put to their heads . One New Orleans detective , a black who had been given immunity from prosecution , corroborated some elements of the government 's case . More than 20 other police officers , however , denounced the testimony of the accusers . " There are high-pressure salesmen and there are low-pressure salesmen , " said Detective Dale Bonura , a 14-year police veteran . " We 're not high-pressure salesmen . We like to kill them with kindness . " <P> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sergeant John E. McKenzie , 40 , or Detective Stephen Farrar , 30 . They will now appeal their convictions , which could lead to eleven-year sentences . Said Government Prosecutor Michael Johnson : " This civil rights case sent a message to New Orleans that they have a problem , or that they had one in November of 1980 . " Others would just as soon forget the Algiers tragedy . Said Joe Giarrusso , president of the city council : " This case ought to be put to rest and not be a thorn in the community 's side .
