Reaganomics <P> <P> To the Editors : <P> Here 's hoping we will all take the medicine the Administration prescribes and support Paul Volcker and the Federal Reserve Board in their determination to stop inflation Sept. 21 . There are no free rides for the sin of overspending . <P> Frank Wall <P> Redlands , Calif . <P> <P> Mr. Reagan can cut the budget , he can cut taxes , he can even cut flowers , but if he does n't cut the interest rate nothing positive is going to happen . <P> Robert P. Morrison <P> Tucson <P> <P> Reduced inflation , reduced interest rates and a balanced budget are fundamental . But how do you attain them ? By reducing " entitlement accounts . " I receive Social Security , but I believe senior citizens should accept the pain along with the younger generation . <P> Burton Hughes <P> Jadwin , Mo . <P> <P> I am undecided who committed the greater folly , Reagan or me . Reagan , for reducing taxes before balancing the budget , or me , for voting for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> <P> Many years ago , when there was no Social Security , welfare , Medicaid or unemployment insurance , the needy would come to my grandmother 's door and she would help them out with money . Today Reagan is turning back to that world , except that this time , the needy may take what they need at gunpoint . <P> Otis Kidwell Burger <P> Colebrook , Conn . <P> <P> Faulting Wall Street for the state of the economy is like blaming the thermometer for the weather . <P> Leon Bromberg , M.D. <P> Galveston , Texas <P> <P> Feline Phobia <P> <P> Your article on books promoting the cult of ailurophobia , the hatred or fear of cats Sept. 21 , reminds me of the Chinese proverb : " He whodislikes the cat was in his former life a rat . " <P> Jane P. Wilkinson <P> Alexandria , Va . <P> <P> Do n't classify all of us animal lovers with the cat worshipers who apparently have neither a sense of humor nor a sense of proportion . Anybody who ca n't laugh at the pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick . <P> Elisabeth Arvin <P> Alvaton , Ky . <P> <P> There 's a big difference between Polish jokes and cat jokes because for cats , " harmless " ridicule often leads to physical abuse . No cat remains unaffected when it 's been set afire , had an eye shot out , or been locked in a closet for three weeks . <P> Paula Sedor <P> Public Affairs , Felines Inc . <P> Evanston , Ill . <P> <P> Considering that only one out of every eleven cats is lucky enough to have a home and the other ten are homeless creatures with a life expectancy of a year , your statement calling felines " pampered pets " seems inaccurate . <P> Deb Sitkin , Secretary <P> C.L.A. W.S. <P> Ridgefield , Conn . <P> <P> Cat haters are of four types : the insecure , the egocentric , the stumbler , the peasant . By their manner of recoil shall ye know them . <P> Jean R. Hoppin <P> Columbus <P> <P> Benito Mussolini , Napoleon , Louis XIV and Alexander the Great were all cat haters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twain were all cat lovers . I much prefer the company of the latter group . <P> Nadine S. Colbert <P> Rockville , Md . <P> <P> Resisting Rape
