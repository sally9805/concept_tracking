The U.S. dollar had the financial world in a tizzy last week . Buy and sell orders for the currency flooded into markets around the world , propelled by gusts of verbiage that flew between Washington and its major foreign economic allies . Money traders from Sydney to London to San Francisco whipsawed the value of the greenback before it settled down somewhat at week 's end , 2.4% higher against major currencies than the week before . <P> This exercise in dollar diplomacy was evidence that a spirit of economic cooperation , which prevailed only a year ago among the major Western economic powers , has seriously eroded . The basis for the turmoil : sharp differences between the Reagan Administration and U.S. trading partners over how to deal with the nation 's huge trade deficit . Rather than concord , said Rimmer de Vries , chief international economist for Morgan Guaranty Trust , " it 's open warfare . " <P> Late last week , on the eve of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , the finance ministers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France and the U.S. closeted themselves for more than seven hours in Treasury Secretary James Baker 's conference room in Washington to discuss the increasingly painful issue . The aim of the so-called Group of Five was to restore some semblance of unity to worldwide monetary policy . They failed to do that on Friday , but after a 4 1/2 hour Saturday meeting with their counterparts from Canada and Italy issued a bland communique . It said that " cooperative efforts need to be intensified . <P> The strained mood in Washington contrasted greatly with the atmosphere after a G-5 meeting at New York City 's Plaza Hotel in September of last year . There the Western powers agreed to reduce the value of the dollar in concert , and thus try to undercut the U.S. trade deficit . In fact the dollar had already begun to decline , starting in February 1985 , but the Plaza pact marked a commitment to continue the trend . From its February peak , the dollar fell by some 30% against other major currencies within 18 months . <P> The ultimate gambit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far . In theory , a weaker dollar should eventually cut into the trade deficit by making imports more expensive and exports more competitive . Instead , the deficit is running at an annual rate of $175 billion , compared with a record $148.5 billion in 1985 . <P> Baker had for months urged West German and Japanese officials to stimulate their economies , preferably by lowering interest rates , and thus encourage U.S. exports . But he felt his pleas were falling on deaf ears . On Sept. 18 , the Treasury Secretary warned that if West Germany and Japan refused to take steps to expand their economies , the dollar would have to depreciate further . His threat started the latest U.S. currency tailspin . Within 24 hours the dollar for the first time in more than five years traded for less than two West German deutsche marks . <P> America 's allies , who would prefer that the U.S. restrain domestic demand by cutting its budget deficit , jawboned back . European finance ministers and central bankers met on Sept. 21 at the Scottish resort of Gleneagles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prop up the greenback . The dollar thereupon rebounded.
