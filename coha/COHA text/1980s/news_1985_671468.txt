There were shotguns , rifles , handguns , crossbows , blowguns , kung fu throwing stars and fighting sticks , brass knuckles , 50 , 000-volt electric " stun guns , " daggers , rapiers , sabers , parts , plans , kits and books to convert semiautomatic weapons into machine guns - even a kit of chemicals to make 20-odd gallons of napalm. // Every year there are several hundred to perhaps a thousand gun shows , and they are veritable supermarkets of weapons . At the one this weekend sponsored by the Dallas Arms Collectors Association , hundreds of dealers and private collectors filled 1 , 700 tables at Market Hall here. // Such shows , which are growing in number and size across the country , are both a testament to America ' s fascination with weapons and the source of a growing concern for gun control advocates. // The shows are generally organized by gun clubs or others who zealously defend what they maintain is every American ' s right to keep and bear arms . As a result dealers and private exhibitors maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conversion Kits for Sale // Thus such shows , as in Dallas , will house display tables offering for sale semiautomatic assault-style weapons like the military M-1 and M-16 rifles , or the M-16 ' s civilian version , the AR-15 , all of which can be purchased by anyone who can legally buy a hunting rifle , side by side with other tables offering parts , plans , kits and manuals to convert these weapons to fully automatic machine guns. // A machine gun can be bought only by a person who has been fingerprinted and holds a permit in the form of a $200 tax stamp issued by the Treasury Department . So anyone seeking to avoid buying the tax stamp , and being fingerprinted and letting it be known he has the gun , can do so by buying a semiautomatic weapon and the kit to convert it. // Earlier this month , the Federal Government began to crack down on such illegal conversions by charging two companies in California and Georgia with conspiring to violate Federal gun laws. // According to John C. Killorin , chief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tobacco and Firearms , the indictments culminated a yearlong investigation into allegations that the companies and their officers were involved in a scheme to market kits and parts from which machine guns and illegal silencers could be assembled . <> <> Investigation Continues // " We are alleging that one company manufactured some part , another the rest , and the parts were advertised and sold with the knowledge that they could and were in fact being illegaly assembled , " said Stephen E. Higgins , the director of the bureau. // In that case , the allegations dealt specifically with parts to assemble silencers , but the bureau is also continuing its investigation into the manufacture and marketing of conversion kits to turn semiautomatic weapons into machine guns. // At one booth at the Dallas gun show , a conversion kit for a MAC-10 semiautomatic weapon , which is easily and often converted to a machine gun , was offered for $75. // When the dealer was told a similar kit was offered at a Mississippi gun show a month earlier for $30 , he replied , " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ' ve got. " // Another problem arising at gun shows , according to Art Agnos , a California Assemblyman , is that exhibitors at such shows who are not dealers fall into the category of private collectors . People in that category can sell handguns and other weapons without requiring the purchaser to fill out the firearms form required for a purchase from a dealer . <> <> Pistol Sold to Felon // Last month at a gun show in Stockton , Calif . , Mr. Agnos , paying in cash and without providing any identification , bought a . 32-caliber Berreta automatic pistol identical to one that was used to shoot him in 1973 , in a wave of random violence known as the Zebra attacks that included 14 murders and seven armed assaults. // While Mr. Agnos was buying that weapon , another man , a convicted felon , used $150 the Assemblyman provided him to buy another automatic pistol at another table. // Neither man was asked to provide a driver ' s license or to provide any other form of identification. // It is illegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case the buyer , who has served prison terms for armed robbery , possession of a sawed-off shotgun and assaulting a police officer , signed a false name to a statement that he had not been convicted of a crime , but he was not asked to provide proof of identity . <> <> Bill Would Limit Sales // As a result of the incident , Mr. Agnos has introduced a bill that would require all handgun sales in California to be made through a dealer , with a mandatory 15-day waiting period and background check. // A companion bill would ban the sale , tranfer or possession of any semiautomatic " military assault weapons " such as the AR-15 , the M-16 and similar weapons , including the semiautomatic Uzi , the Israeli assault weapon originally designed as a machine gun , which can be restored to that mode with conversion kits that are readily available. // Such legislation is hotly opposed by gun advocates , and their attitude is reflected in posters and T-shirts for sale at gun shows like the one in Dallas this weekend. // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being Able to Hit Your Target. " // Another , displaying a silenced Uzi submachine gun , bears the legend " The Whisper of Authority. " // A poster warns , " If you are found here at night , you will be found here in the morning. " // And another T-shirt urges , " Join the Marines . Travel to exotic , distant lands . Meet exciting , unusual people . And kill them . " As for the proliferation of gun shows , which are organized by gun fanciers and hobbyists , Mr. Killorin said that the bureau investigated any complaints of abuses but did not monitor the shows as a routine matter. // " We are interested in guns going to criminals , " he said . " We do not expend resources in fishing expeditions at gun shows. " //
