The other morning a very anxious woman called an office in downtown Chicago with a request that any mother could understand . " I want to get him out of the house , " she said . " He 's a nice boy . A doctor . But he 's 38 , for goodness ' sake . " The answer , of course , is to find that nice doctor a bride . And that is exactly what Heather Stern is in business to do : she is a matchmaker , ' 80s style . <P> Admittedly , this mother 's request was unusual . But Stern 's seven-year-old Chicago company , Personal Profiles , takes most problems to its bosom in its quest to find a spouse for each of its 1,650 clients , ranging from architects and artists to lawyers and engineers . This is not your matchmaker of old , Yente of Fiddler on the Roof or the garrulous busybody of Crossing Delancey , the sort of woman who knows her potential lovebirds like a good breeder knows horseflesh . Stern , who is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scientific ; more , she says , like the methods used by an executive search firm . As evidence , she boasts of more than 100 marriages and &; no divorces . Hopeful brides and bridegrooms are probed for their creditworthiness , their job history and their marital status . Appearance and habits are carefully noted : Does he bite his nails ? Does she have bad teeth ? They are prodded for their likes and dislikes : Does he like reggae ? Does she like Rostropovich ? " I try to introduce two people who are so similar to each other that when the going gets rough , they can fall back on their similarities . If a client likes to sail , he 's a poor match for a woman who gets seasick . " <P> Such is vanity that Stern 's clients sometimes have unrealistic visions of the sort of person they could reasonably expect to attract as a mate . " We had this gentleman , very bright but average looking , certainly no Tom Selleck , and he described someone who looked like Farrah Fawcett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 can ask for a 10 . " That means compromise , as one of Stern 's clients , whom we will call Lucy , quickly found . She was 37 and divorced and was after the sort of man who sets hearts pounding on L.A. Law . She was introduced to Nigel , who was pleasant in every way , except , oh , horror , he was bald , and Lucy 's vision of a dreamboat did not include an absence of hair . At first she was cold to Nigel 's advances . But gradually her heart warmed , and last December they were married . <P> Why , it might reasonably be asked , would people pay Stern $1,450 for a 24- month effort to find them a mate , rather than doing for themselves what is supposed to come naturally ? The answer is dismally simple . " They are just too busy . If you are working 60 to 80 hours a week , there is very little time to go out hunting . Single people have organized their lives to get what they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then one day they say , Gee , I want to be married . So they hire a consultant like me to help them . They ca n't buy love really  --  but kind of . "
