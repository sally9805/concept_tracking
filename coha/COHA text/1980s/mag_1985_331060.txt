Cap Weinberger has lionized Winston Churchill all his adult life . He has collected and read his published works many times over , and he frequently quotes the wartime British Prime Minister in dinner-party conversation . He has gone to the trouble of acquiring a canvas by Churchill , an amateur painter of some note . Two years after Weinberger became Defense Secretary , he chose to schedule a speech at Westminster College , the tiny Missouri school where Churchill delivered his famous " Iron Curtain " address in 1946 . Though he employs a speechwriting staff of four , Weinberger insisted on writing much of the speech himself , including its most memorable passage . " We are perhaps in danger of becoming a nation of ascetic systems analysts , " he said , " without the glowing fire and the vision and the ability to inspire that Churchill possessed in such full measure . " <P> Although he would never presume to make the comparison directly , it is hard to believe that Weinberger , 67 , does not see links between his mission at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he strove to rearm an unwilling Britain against the onslaught of Nazism . Weinberger was never viewed as a hawk in earlier phases of his public career , notably as Budget Director and Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare in the Nixon and Ford Administrations . Yet when Weinberger returned to Washington in 1981 , almost overnight he began sounding Cassandra-like warnings about the Soviet Union 's impending military threat . What shocked him most , according to associates , was a series of intelligence briefings that documented the extent of Soviet technological progress during his six years out of office . " I was astounded , " Weinberger told Writer Theodore White , a Harvard classmate . " Their buildup had gone so far and so fast , and all of it was in offensive , not defensive , weapons . " Weinberger concluded , and still believes , that the Soviets are intent on " world domination . " Weinberger had no trouble conveying the urgency of his concern to the one man in a position to do something about it , Ronald Reagan . Not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategic buildup in U.S. military might , he had known and trusted Weinberger from California days . The two had remained close even after Weinberger left to work in Washington . Weinberger kept Reagan 's photograph on his desk , and on occasional weekends flew across the nation to Sacramento to confer with the Governor . <P> With Reagan 's encouragement , Weinberger resurrected the B-1 bomber program , which had been scuttled by the Carter Administration , set the goal of a 600- ship Navy by 1989 and invested heavily in military readiness , hoping to lengthen the " sustainability " of U.S. forces in the field from less than 30 days to 60 days or more . One of his proudest accomplishments has been a 25% rise in military salaries over the past four years , helping increase the reenlistment rate from 55% to 68% and the proportion of high school graduates from 81% to 93%.
