After Warner Bros , excised half an hour from George Cukor 's 1954 remake of A Star Is Born , the director vowed never to see the film again . Last week at New York City 's Radio City Music Hall , after a painstaking reassembly , the original version that Cukor loved-all three hours of it-was shown publicly for the first time since its release 29 years ago . James Mason , 74 , who played Norman Maine to Judy Garland 's Esther Blodgett took a bow at intermission , but Film Historian Ronald Haver was the true star of the show . Combing musty film vaults in Brooklyn and Hollywood , Haver first found a copy of the original sound track , which he used as a guide when he began splicing in the bits and pieces of missing film that he found . The tale has many of the ingredients of a great detective story , but its penultimate scene is the stuff of pure Hollywood legend . On the night before he would have attended the first private screening of the restored movie earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the end , all the backstage banter about a romantic reconciliation and all the coy onstage asides were but means of bloating the box office of their ponderous Broadway revival of Nol Coward 's comedy Private Lives . Mercifully , it seems that Richard Burton , 57 , and Elizabeth Taylor , 51 , may never replay their headline-grabbing love affair again . For last week , at the Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas ( what could be more romantic ? ) , Burton wed his companion of the past 18 months , Sally Hay , 35 . It was Burton 's fifth reading of the wedding vows . ( Past partners : Sybil Williams , Taylor , Taylor again , and Susan Hunt . ) After learning of the marriage , Taylor , whose current consort is Mexican Lawyer Victor Luna , pursed her lips into a smile and said , " I 've known all along they would be married and happy together . " <P> It was everything James Watt could have hoped for in a July 4th , and more . While the Interior Secretary watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , his celebrated choice for the capital 's Independence Day concert , Wayne Newton , 41 , hauled his sequined Las Vegas act out onto the Washington Mall . ( One local radio station suggested that a two-drink minimum be imposed to make the entertainer feel more at home . ) Doffing a headdress that had been presented to him earlier-Newton is part Indian-the singer milked the day 's patriotic sentiment , kicking off with his own version of Neil Diamond 's America , which ended with a shameless appeal to Martin Luther King 's memory as Newton intoned a snatch of King 's " I have a dream " speech . Mawkishness went on to new depths , even for a July 4th , with Newton 's lead-in to Tie a Yellow Ribbon . " May there never be another American held hostage on foreign soil , " he solemnly descanted . " And if you feel like singing along with us , do it . " Where did you say the Beach Boys were playing ?             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
