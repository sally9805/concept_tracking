In still other families , packing a lunch at home is considered a money saver , although the 80 cents or so charged to children who do not qual-ify for free lunch is often less than the cost of a homemade meal. // Two questions are usually uppermost in the minds of parents : what to include that will be healthful and nutritious ( and at least as good , if not better than what the school serves ) and how to keep the lunch from spoiling before it is eaten. // All parents must realize that no food can be nourishing if a child will not eat it . So the first rule is to consider the child ' s likes and dislikes , which are typically extreme , especially during the preteen years. // For some children , finding just one piece of mushroom in the tomato sauce will prompt them to refuse the whole dish . There are questions of peer pressure , such as that faced by a sardine-loving child who refused to take sardine sandwiches to school because friends ridiculed the selection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as the rumor in one elementary school that there were bugs in tuna fish ; thereafter some children refused to take tuna sandwiches for lunch. // At the same time , it is not unusual for children to insist on the same one or two lunchtime selections day after day , week after week and , in some cases , year after year . Parents , appalled by such a lack of variety , might be appeased by one mother ' s belief that the predictability of lunch reassures her child , who is sometimes unnerved by the ever-changing demands of school . Assuming that their limited food preferences are reasonably nutritious , children will come to no harm if they take the same lunch every day . Just try to provide variety and nutritional balance in meals eaten at home. // It may help to have children participate in lunch selection and preparation , perhaps using the opportunity to explain the nutritional virtues and evils of the items chosen . As a check on what actually gets eaten , I insisted that my children bring home leftovers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecture . An alternative is to ask children from time to time what they ate for lunch and see how well it matches what you prepared. // A number of other guidelines and lunch-packing suggestions will help nutrition-minded parents. // Consider the overall structure of lunch . Ideally , it should contain a protein-rich food , a complex carbohydrate ( usually bread ) , vegetables or fruit and a beverage . Dessert other than fruit is optional from a nutrition standpoint but may be a social necessity . Children whose lunch boxes are devoid of cookies or similar fare often trade their fruit for someone else ' s sweet . Far better to give children both the fruit and a cookie or two . You might even suggest that the second cookie be used for trading , but insist that the fruit be eaten or traded only for someone else ' s fruit. // Protein can be provided by meat , poultry , fish , cheese , peanut butter , eggs , beans , cottage cheese or yogurt . Too often , however , parents fall back on cold cuts like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 85 percent of their calories come from fat ) , most of which is artery-damaging saturated fat . In addition , they are salty and preserved with nitrates and nitrites , which may promote cancer . Among cold cuts , better selections include roast turkey or chicken or beef . Turkey ham and turkey bologna are much lower in fat but still high in salt and preservatives . In some areas , low-salt ham ( boiled ham is low in fat ) is available , though this too contains nitrates or nitrites. // Cheese , often a childhood favorite that has the added virtue of resisting spoilage , is also high in fat and salt . Try a reduced-fat processed cheese or one in which the saturated butterfat has been replaced by vegetable oil . Hard cheeses like natural Swiss and part-skim mozzarella are comparatively low in fat ; Swiss is also fairly low in salt . Still , if regular processed American cheese is all your child will eat , it is better than nothing ; just try to limit its amount and frequency. // For tuna sandwiches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuna is much higher in fat ) and dressing the tuna with a mixture of plain yogurt and mayonnaise to keep the fat content low . If canned salmon , sardines or other fish are used , crush the calcium-rich bones and include them. // Cottage cheese can be combined with raisins , crushed pineapple , sunflower seeds , chopped apple , shredded carrot or other foods , but it tends to make bread mushy by lunchtime . So , pack it in a separate container - include a plastic spoon or knife in the lunchbox - and let the child spread it on the bread at lunchtime . Pita , Middle Eastern pocket bread , works especially well for such moist fillings. // As for the perennial favorite , peanut butter , consider alternatives to jelly such as unsweetened apple butter , sliced banana , chopped apple and raisins . If possible , use plain ground peanut butter ( no sugar , salt or hydrogenated vegetable oil added ) ; you may want to wean children from typical commercial peanut butters by mixing the two and gradually increasing the proportion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A piece of chicken , fish ( boneless ) or meat loaf can be eaten plain or in a sandwich . Leftover cold pizza is also favored by some . Hot-packed casseroles , such as pasta and sauce , Spanish rice , macaroni and cheese , hamburger or tuna hot dish , chili or main-dish soups are other possibilities . Cold cubes of meat or chicken , cheese , vegetables and fruit may also have child appeal. // It is the rare child who prefers the nutritionally more desirable whole-wheat varieties of bread . Better to use enriched white bread than to have children throw away the dark bread of their sandwiches . My children were often satisfied by the " integrated " approach : a slice of white bread and one of whole wheat . If you like bread baking , you are in luck : most children enjoy homemade bread made mainly with whole-wheat flour and other nutritious ingredients . Crackers as a bread alternative are often high in fat and salt , except for certain crisp breads such as Wasa . Other starchy lunch selections might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a serving of unsweetened dry cereal or rice pudding. // Include one or more cut-up raw vegetable or steamed fresh vegetables , such as carrots , celery , cherry tomatoes , green beans , broccoli flowerets , zucchini , sweet pepper ( red or green ) - anything your child likes . Cooked vegetables should be tender-crisp to enhance their appeal and nutrition . You might also include a small leak-proof plastic container of a favorite dip or salad dressing . A container of coleslaw , grated carrot and raisin salad , three-bean salad or potato salad are other alternatives. // Any fresh fruit is acceptable , although some , like bananas or plums , are prone to bruising in a lunch pail . To minimize damage to fruit and maximize the likelihood of consumption , it may be best to offer sliced fruits such as pineapple , oranges and melon or a fruit salad packed in a plastic container. // Include two servings of fruit if there is no vegetable in the lunchbox . Canned or frozen fruits are acceptable if packed in their own juices or in fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruits and the latest rage , fruit rolls , are extremely sweet and tend to stick to children ' s teeth , where they feed decay-causing bacteria for hours. // To meet calcium and protein needs , children should drink milk , preferably skim or low-fat . Chocolate milk is acceptable once or twice a day , if your child insists . Many children are able to buy milk in school . Otherwise , pack it in a vacuum bottle to keep it cold . If yogurt is used as the protein or dessert , fruit juice or tomato juice is an acceptable alternative to milk as a beverage . Beware of nectars ; most have lots of added sugar , so read the label . Soft drinks ( carbonated or otherwise ) are not nutritious luncheon items. // Besides fruit , children often clamor for a sweet treat . Consider baking cookies , muffins or quick breads , with the children helping , using less sugar than most recipes call for and substituting vegetable oil for hard fats and whole wheat flour for some of the white flour . Homemade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cakelike cookies made with cottage cheese are nutritious substitutes for the average commercial fare . So are bran muffins and zucchini bread . Nonsweet snacks might include unsalted nuts , sunflower seeds or unbuttered popcorn ; try a sprinkling of grated Parmesan instead of salt. // During the warm days of fall and spring and in overheated classrooms in winter , consider the safety of storing a lunch unrefrigerated for several hours . Some simple measures can greatly reduce the risk of spoilage. // * Prepare lunches with clean hands on a clean surface using clean utensils . Do not prepare ready-to-eat foods on a surface that was used for raw animal foods without washing the surface first. // * Chill the foods and the lunch box before packing them ( this is best done the night before ) and keep them refrigerated until just before the child leaves for school. // * Consider buying an insulated lunch bag or a pail that has a small reusuable freezer pack . If your child insists on a brown bag , layer several bags for added insulation. // * Freeze the ingredients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except those with mayonnaise ) , yogurt or cans of juice , and pack them frozen into the lunch box . They will defrost by lunchtime and help to keep all the foods cold. // * Use fresh ingredients or leftovers that are not more than a day old ( unless they were frozen ) and that were refrigerated promptly after their original use. // * Use only commercial mayonnaise in unrefrigerated sandwiches ; studies show that it inhibits the growth of food poisoning organisms . Ketchup and mustard are also good seasonings. // * Use insulated containers ( thermos type ) to hold foods that should be kept hot or cold . Heat or chill the container with boiling water or ice water before filling it. // * Thoroughly clean the lunch pail , thermos and other containers with hot soapy water each day . Do not reuse plastic bags unless they have been washed well. //
