Dr Pepper finds a buyer <P> Although it has long had a loyal following among soft-drink guzzlers , 98-year-old Dr Pepper ( 1982 sales : $516.1 million ) has gradually been losing its fizz . The company 's namesake Dr Pepper brand fell from 5.4% of the soft-drink market in 1981 to 5.1% last year . Moreover , the Dallas-based firm knew things might continue getting worse because it lacks the financial and marketing clout to compete effectively against the soft-drink industry 's giants : Coca-Cola ( 1982 sales : $6.2 billion ) and highly diversified PepsiCo ( 1982 sales : $7.5 billion ) . So , taking a hint from one of its old commercials , Dr Pepper has been looking for a friendly pepper-upper . Last week the company found one . Dr Pepper agreed to be acquired for $512.5 million by Forstmann Little &; Co. , a closely held New York investment firm . <P> The deal was the second major purchase in two days for Forstmann Little , which was formed in 1978 by Wall Streeter Wm . Brian Little , now 41 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nicholas C. , 36 . The day before , the firm had agreed to buy Topps Chewing Gum ( fiscal 1983 sales : $69.7 million ) , makers of the famous baseball cards , for some $95 million . Last January Forstmann Little paid about $100 million for Beverage Management of Columbus , a bottler of Seven-Up and Royal Crown Cola . Said Emanuel Goldman , a leading beverage analyst with San Francisco-based Montgomery Securities : " They truly have a full-scale commitment to the U.S. soft-drink industry . " <P> Some observers doubted , however , that Forstmann Little would have much impact on Dr Pepper . Says Hugh Zurkuhlen of Wall Street 's Salomon Brothers : " It 's unlikely that Forstmann Little is going to make a big national push with Dr Pepper . " Brian Little said the beverage company 's officers , including Chairman W.W. Clements , 69 , will remain on the job following the acquisition . " We are owners only , " Little noted . " We do n't get involved in management . " <P> The biggest gainers in the deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wall Street investment banking house . Stockholders will receive $22 each for shares that were worth about $15 only two weeks ago . Lazard Frres , which put the deal together , will walk away with $2.5 million for services rendered .
