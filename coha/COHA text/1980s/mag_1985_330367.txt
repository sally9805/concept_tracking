America is a country that endlessly reinvents itself , working the alchemy that turns " them " into " us . " That is the American secret : motion , new combinations , absorption . The process is wasteful , dangerous , messy , sometimes tragic . It is also inspiring . The story , in its ideal , is one of earthly redemption . <P> The idea is reckless , taking in so many strangers , hurling all those contradictory genes and customs and temperaments into the same room . It goes against human nature . Strangers are not supposed to set up civilizations together . A nation must arise out of a tribe , out of affinities of blood . At one time , if some Pacific island tribesmen encountered a man they had not seen before , they simply killed  --  and sometimes ate  --  him . Tribal policy . But the U.S. , with its great polyglot ingathering , went brilliantly to the other extreme . <P> The kinetic energy of new combinations is changing the U.S. today as profoundly as it did at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ellis Island . The faces are different now  --  mostly brown and yellow . Twenty years ago , more than half of all immigrants came from Europe and Canada . Today , most are Mexicans , Filipinos , Vietnamese , Koreans , Indians , Chinese , Dominicans , Jamaicans . They scramble up across the border near San Ysidro , Calif. , in the middle of the night . They get off their jets and stream through Customs at Kennedy . They arrive in the trunks of cars or wash up in foundering boats on the Florida Keys . <P> Native-born Americans are ambivalent about the new arrivals . Ambivalence is what old Americans have always felt toward new Americans . At a remove of several generations from Ellis Island , some sentimentalize the immigrant experience . They project their nostalgia upon today 's immigrants and wish them well . But the native-born also feels the alien vibration . Alien is a dank and sinister word  --  the ominous otherness , not our kind . The alien stands across a gap through which a killer wind can blow . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Racism in new combinations jounces around . Traditional nativist whites find themselves in the same improbable club with native American blacks condemning the brown and yellow foreigners who are taking their jobs away . <P> The new immigrants are an insistent presence . A single cluster of 14 brown brick stores in New York City harbors a Korean beauty parlor , a Chinese hardware store , a South Asian spice shop , a Chinese watch store and a Korean barber . At a high school on Chicago 's Far North Side , algebra classes are conducted not only in English but in Spanish , Cantonese , Vietnamese and Assyrian . Along Bolsa Avenue in Santa Ana , Calif. , virtually every sign for more than a mile is in Vietnamese : Vietnamese supermarkets , bookstores , pharmacies that deal in rare herbs . Ten years ago , nothing was there but warehouses and strawberry fields .
