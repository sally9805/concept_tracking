ON BEING COURTEOUS WHEN COMPELLED TO BREAK THE LAW by Heinrich Boll I T WOULD SEEM idle to extol the obvious forms of courtesy : that naturally one holds the front door open for a child ; that one not only refrains from pushing ahead of a child when shopping but steps back for him ; that one allows a tired . stress-ridden schoolchild traveling home on the streetcar , bus , or train to enjoy his seat in peace without disturbing that well-earned peace either verbally or even by so much as staring at him with an expression of moral disapproval . Further , I take it for granted that one does not allow one 's child , one 's cat , dog , or bird , to go hungry , that one is prepared , if need be , to go out and steal food for them , and it goes without saying that one must not let one 's wife or girlfriend hunger or thirst either ; that none of them should be beaten , even when they ask for it , the courtesy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one should not pour the honored guest the first , second , or , if at all possible , even the third , but the fourth cup from the teapot , bearing in mind the Chinese proverb : Courtesy lies close to the bottom of the teapot . Among those courtesies we take for granted is that when dealing with people of either sex who regard themselves as our inferiors  --  for ESSENTIALLY the concept of " inferior " is , obviously , unacceptable --  -- one must use a slightly more subdued , more restrained tone of voice than when dealing with those who regard themselves as our superiors ; of course , the concept of " superior " is also ESSENTIALLY unacceptable , since you can not simply have a superior served up to you like a bowl of soup , and indealing with these superiors one should not , need I say , be loud and rude but merely a shade less subdued and a shade less courteous ; this behavior might slightly modify the structures . Moreover , when confronted by a person one dislikes one should not simply make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like your mug ! " It is possible to express one 's aversion courteously , perhaps as follows , and preferably in writing , since the spoken word always carries with it the risk of rudeness : " By reason of unfathomable , inscrutable , I will not say cosmic constellations , not wishing to make the stars and their ascendants solely responsible  --  by reason , therefore , of circumstances that are neither solely responsible nor solely predestined , the  --  shall we say  --  strands of sympathetic response between us have unfortunately ( I would ask you to interpret this unfortunately ' as an expression of my regret as well as of my abstract respect for your person ) proven incapable of animation . Hence , although ' essentially ' you are a most pleasant person and figure , I deem it advisable , indeed necessary , to restrict the number of our encounters to a minimum , to that minimum which compels us , for professional reasons , from time to time to shake hands , discuss details  --  encounters that are unavoidable in view of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question may be inserted , e.g. : novels , bolts , herrings in aspic . Beyond this necessary minimum I suggest that we eschew the sound of each other 's voices , the sight of our skin and hair , the perception of the odors we emanate . It is with some regret that I advise you of this , in the hope that these unfathomable constellations and combinations may change , that the strands of sympathetic response between us may become animated , and that an altered overall situation of sympathetic exchange may possibly enable us to extend the necessary professional contacts to the private domain . Yours most respectfully . . . . " Such forms of courtesy appear to me too obvious to require more than a passing allusion . B Y CONTRAST , HOWEVER , it seems to me as difficult as it is necessary to point to courtesy in unconventional , indeed illegal , situations . It must be emphasized that ESSENTIALLY the actions I should like to enlarge upon are not merely unconventional or immoral but downright criminal . Let us take , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is discourteous , such as a bank robbery or a bank holdup , and let us consider that lady , heretofore so law-abiding , respectable , and honorable , who in broad daylight ? more precisely , at about 3 : 29 n.m. ? relieved a savings bank in the suburb of a large German city of 7,000 marks . Try to imagine the scene : a sixty-one-year-old lady of the type known as frail , whose appearance calls to mind solitaire or bridge , the widow of a lieutenant-colonel , enters the branch of a savings bank in order to appropriate a sum of money by illegal means ! If this lady became known as the " courteous bank robber , " was in fact described as such in the police files , the use of the adjective " courteous " was intended to convey her particularly dangerous quality . This lady did instinctively what the courteous bank robber must do : not even think of weapons , of violence , or shouting , not even consider such clumsy methods . After all , it is not merely discourteous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shout : " Hand over the dough , or shoot ! " And of course a Lady such as ours does not enter just any old bank simply out of abstract greed , or because she has suddenly become unbalanced , but because in her extremity she has regained her balance . She has carefully considered this action and has her motives ! The dire plight that forces this lady to this , to put it mildly , unconventional act must be briefly outlined . She has a son who , having taken the wrong turn , has served a few minor prison sentences but has now , discharged once again from jail , found a girlfriend who exerts a stabilizing influence on him . He has a chance of being employed as a pharmaceutical salesman  --  his mother has spent a small fortune on telephone calls and postage , has made use of all her connections ( among them two generals still on active duty ) to obtain this chance for him . And now , like a bolt from the blue and at the last moment , comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother -- -that very lady who became known as the courteous bank robber  --  has found him a small apartment , developed an affection for his girlfriend , everything is going splendidly , and now that bombshell : a 5,000-mark bond ! Try to imagine the scene : the lady 's bank credit has already been strained to the utmost ; her pension has shrunk to a bare subsistence level , the greater part going to pay off the bank ; she has borrowed wherever she could  --  from bridge friends , her husband 's old fellow officers ( among them two colonels and a general ) , all nice people ; she has already eliminated the egg from her breakfast menu , and as she stands there in her apartment all she can think of is : " Beg , borrow , or steal ! " and this popular saying turns out to be relatively disastrous for the savings bank . " Beg , borrow , or steal ! " ? stealing seems to be the obvious remedy . I should add that the lady is not only frail but proud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forced to submit to several thousand well-meant pieces of advice , swallow snide remarks about her beloved son ; she has sold most of her furniture , disposed of her collie , to whom she was very attached , and quarreled about this with her best friend , who actually said : " A dog for a dog  --  that 's no bargain ! " She has visited her son in a number of jails , paid legal fees , incurred traveling expenses . The only luxury she still permits herself is the telephone : in order that her son can call her at any time , and she him , if he happens to have access to a telephone . There are even moments when she not only believes she understands him but actually does . The social experiences of the past four years have pushed her inwardly to the verge of becoming a social dropout , but not outwardly : she is always well groomed , looks younger than she is , and now , after her son has raised the alarm over the telephone , the fateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or steal , " and its implications take root in her mind in a manner unforeseen by those who spread such sayings . Steal , she thinks , that 's the solution , when around two o'clock she remembers that spruce little savings-bank branch situated at the edge of a park in a nearby suburb . Before leaving her apartment she feeds her pretty dwarf finches , tiny birds half the size of a thumb , which she can still afford . The word " steal , " so foreign to her , becomes increasingly familiar as she approaches the park in the adjacent suburb , which shereaches by about 3:05 . Steal , she thinks , where does one steal bread ? In a bakery . Where does one steal sausage ? At a butcher 's . Where does one steal money ? From a till or a bank . The till is immediately rejected , she finds that too personal , she does not wish to rob anyone directly ; besides , what till would ever contain 5,000 marks ? And robbing a till seems to her too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CONSCIENCE HAS long since ceased to bother her , she is already preoccupied with tactical and strategic deliberations . Hidden in some bushes , she looks across to the smart little savings bank , knowing that it closes at 2:30 . The bank is empty of customers , and strange things shoot through her mind : naturally she sometimes watches television , she also occasionally goes to the movies , and she thinks  --  not of weapons , not even of toy weapons , but of the stocking pulled over the face : which had always made her shudder because it was an affront to her aesthetic sense , that deformation of a human face . Moreover , she feels it is beneath her dignity here in the bushes to deprive one of her legs of its stocking ; besides , it would provide a clue for possible pursuers . In these deliberations  --  as the indulgent reader will immediately discern  --  aesthetics , morals , and tactics come together in unique fashion ! In her handbag is a pair of oversized dark glasses  --  a gift from her son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glasses , ruffles her normally neatly coiffed hair , steps out from the bushes , crosses the street , enters the savings bank : behind the window on the right , a young lady sorting vouchers gives her a polite , slightly forced smile because closing time is only a few minutes away ; the center window is closed ; behind the one on the left stands a young man of about thirty-four , counting the contents of the cash drawer . He looks up , smiles at her politely , and says the usual : " Can I help you , madam ? " At that moment she puts her hand into her bag , pulls it out as a clenched fist , steps closer to the window , and whispers : " Unusually compelling circumstances force me to this , I am sorry to say , unavoidable holdup . My right hand contains a nitrite capsule that can cause great havoc . I very much regret having to threaten you , but I need 5,000 marks immediately . Give them to me . Or else . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fact that the teller  --  like most of his colleagues -- is also a courteous person who is not in the least alarmed by the " or 54 else " but instantly grasps the lady 's quandary . Furthermore , professional bank robbers never ask for specific amounts , they demand the whole lot . He pauses in his counting -- he happens to have just reached the five-hundredmark bills !  - -  and whispers : " You are putting me in an embarrassing position if you do n't use more force . Nobody will ever believe me about the explosive capsule if you do n't shout , threaten , put on a convincing scene . After all , there are rules for bank holdups too . You are doing it all wrong . " At that moment the young lady leaves her window , Jocks the bank from the inside , but leaves the key in the lock . The old lady , no less determined , in fact more determined than ever , recognizes her opportunity . " This capsule , " she whispers threateningly . " Nitrite , " says the teller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean nitroglycerine . " " Not only do I mean it , I have it . " It is already clear that the teller , or rather his money , is doomed . Instead of simply pressing the alarm button , he allows himself to be drawn into an argument ; moreover , he already has little beads of perspiration on his forehead and upper lip and is puzzling over what the lady might need the money for : Does she drink ? Take dope ? Has she gambling debts ? A rebellious lover ? He puzzles too much , fails to make use of his rights , and in this  --  it is fair to say strongly meditative  --  intermezzo , the old lady simply thrusts her hand through the window ( she is smart enough to use her left hand ) , grabs as many five-hundred-mark bills as she can , runs to the door , unlocks it , crosses the street , disappears into the bushes  --  and only when she is long out of sight does the teller raise the alarm . It is fairly certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with far greater vigor : would have struck the clenched fist , raised the alarm . Needless to say , the affair had a variety of sequels . Let me allude to the principal ones : the lady was never caught , the teller was not dismissed , merely transferred to a position where he had no direct contact with either cash or the public . When the lady discovered that instead of 5,000 marks she had picked up 7,000 marks , she remitted 1,900 back to the bank and was clever enough not to do this by telegram since that might have led to her identification . She permitted herself a taxi , drove to the railway station . took the next train to her son : that cost her some ninety marks , the remaining ten she spent on coffee and a brandy , which she consumed in the dining car and felt she had earned . When handing the money over to her son , she placed her hand over his mouth and said : " Do n't everask me where I got it from . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty dwarf finches . Almost superfluous to add that things turned out well for her son : of course he read in the newspaper about the strange holdup by the " courteous bank robber , " and this act of solidarization by a criminal action on the part of his mother had a morally stabilizing effect on him , more than several thousand pieces of good advice , more than his stabilizing girlfriend . He became a reliable pharmaceutical salesman with opportunities for advancement , although it must be added that he could not resist saying to his mother on more than one occasion : " Imagine you doing that for me ! " What was never put into words . After much cogitation , the lady fixed the rate of repayment to the bank at one mark a month , her rationale for this low rate being : " Banks can wait . " From time to time she sent the teller some flowers , a book , or a theater ticket , and bequeathed him the only valuable piece of furniture she still possessed : a carved medicine chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for bank employees and bank robbers ; and if bank robbers were completely to exclude weapons or explosive capsules , rude language , and rude behavior from their strategy , the day might come when we would no longer speak of bank holdups but only of forced loans , which will merely be a matter of a nonviolent duel between two different manifestations of courtesy . I must add that bank robbery , when it takes place without violence or physical injury , is quite a popular offense . Every successful bank robbery in which no one is injured releases feelings of joy and even envy among those who would at any time carry out a successful and nonviolent bank robbery if they had the courage . I T IS FAR MORE DIFFICULT even so much as to mention courtesy in the case of an equally punishable offense such as desertion . Strangely enough , deserters are considered to be cowardly , an opinion that on closer inspection fails to hold water . The deserter in wartime risks being shot  --  by either friend or foe , since he never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks he knows from whose hands he is escaping . Whatever national yardsticks one wishes to apply  --  and oddly enough all nations are agreed on this  --  the deserter in wartime risks something , and one should respect his risk . But here I wish to speak about the courteous deserter in peacetime , about that unknown young man who leaves military service without making use of his rights  --  for instance , the right to conscientious objection ; the young man who clears out , disappears  --  if possible in a foreign country  --  simply because he has had enough and is fed up with the main burden of a soldier 's life  --  boredom ; the man who is not attracted by the more or less enforced camaraderie nor by the service as such ; who is left cold by money , food , driver 's license , educational opportunities , chances of promotion ; a nice German boy who  --  let us say  --  has read his Eichendorff in school and found him " overwhelming " ; a pleasant youth who never finished school because he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he enjoyed ; who shortly after passing his apprenticeship test was called up for military service , with a total lack of interest in armored vehicles or weapons of any kind , also with no interest in politics but profoundly , although not exclusively , interested in the manufacture of furniture such as he has observed on a number of visits to Italy in the street-level workshops of Rome and Florence , perhaps also of Siena . Moral problems , such as the occasional out-and-out faking of furniture . do not interest him : he wants he wanted ? to go there , and instead now suddenly finds himself in an infantry barracks in  --  let us say ? Neu-Offenbach . Of course , this young man can be seriously reproached on a number of counts : that he lacks civic consciousness , that he should have cleared out to  --  let us say , Bologna before , rather than after , being called up . He can be reproached for lacking a sense of duty , although this is not the case , since the master carpenter under whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to structural changes in the economy , gave him an excellent reference . His parents , his teachers , even his friend , have repeatedly tried to persuade him that one must think realistically ; yet this pleasant young man does think realistically , he thinks about seasoned wood , about glue and screws , about workbenches and curved chair legs , and of course he also thinks about girls and wine and things like that . The point is : the army means nothing to him , it says nothing to him , gives nothing to him . There are such cases . It is useless to deplore it , although ESSENTIALLY it is deplorable . That is the way the boy happens to be , and to his credit he did behave in a reasonably fair manner , having faithfully completed his so-called basic training : not that he conceded its necessity , it merely aroused his curiosity . But now he has simply had enough , and he does not turn to some counseling service or other  --  church , government , nonpartisan  --  no , he simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does not just sneak off without a word , he writes ( from a safe distance and using misleading , i.e. , Swiss , stamps ) a letter to his captain . " Dear Sir : The fact that I can find no satisfaction in your profession , which I would have to practice for another year , does not , I trust , hurt your feelings , in the same way that I ask you not to take my desertion personally and certainly not as an insult . It so happens that I am not a soldier and never will be , and nothing could be farther from my mind than to reproach you for not being a carpenter and probably not knowing what a tenon is , let alone how it is made . Of course I am aware and I would ask you always to bear this in mind  --  that , although there are laws to force a man to be a soldier for fifteen months , there are no laws to force him to know anything about tenons , and I realize therefore that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and since there is this law that forces me to spend another year of atrocious boredom , I wish to inform you herewith that I am breaking that law . " What pains me is the fact that you were such a nice , agreeable , understanding superior , and that naturally I would prefer to inflict on a lousy , beastly officer the pain I may be inflicting on you . More than once you have protected me , who has so little comprehension of absurd army regulations , from punishment ; you have smiled understandingly at many a foolishness that aroused the ire of my corporal and even of my comrades  --  so understandingly that I suspect a crypto-deserter in you , and again you should take that not as an insult but as a compliment . In short : as my superior you were even better than my master carpenter , but what you  --  or rather , the army ? doled out to me was , quite simply , intolerable , and this does not apply to the food or the allowance but merely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The simple fact is that 1 do not want to go on killing my time ; I want to make it come alive  --  no more , but no less . " The only sensible activity , the only one I enjoyed , was the four-day disaster-relief deployment during the floods in Oberduffendorf : it was most enjoyable paddling the rubber dinghy from house to house and bringing the marooned inhabitants of Oberduffendorf hot soup , coffee , bread , and the tabloid  --  many a face lit up in gratitude ! But I ask you , sir , would it not be positively macabre , even wicked , to wait for further disasters in order to find meaning in military service ? " Hoping that you will understand some of my thoughts and not despise my motives , I remain , respectfully yours . . . " ?
