A marvelous paradox of this football season is that the college quarterback most prized by the pros plays for a team with one of the most god-awful records in the country . The quarterback is John Elway , and he throws bullet passes with cross-hair accuracy . The team is Stanford , which has been beaten by Purdue 27-19 , San Jose State 28-6 , Ohio State 24-19 , Arizona 17-13 , Southern Cal 25-17 , Arizona State 62-36 and Washington 42-31 . Last Saturday 's 63-9 victory over Oregon State was only the second of the year for Stanford ; on Oct. 10 the Cardinals squeaked by UCLA 26-23 . Nevertheless , despite such massive insult and occasional injury  --  Elway has been bothered by a sprained right ankle , a chipped bone in his left hand and a mild concussion  --  the embattled young man has made the pros covet him all the more . In this hellish season he has thrown the ball 309 times and completed 175 passes for a .566 percentage and 2,202 yards . Fifteen of his passes have gone for touchdowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he completed 65.4% of 379 passes for 2,889 yards and 27 touchdowns , has put him near the top of the quarterback heap at a school renowned for its passers . // As the season began , of course , there was no reason to foresee doom and gloom for the Cardinals , and the mood at Palo Alto was light and loose . // The locker-room conversation sounded pretty depressing , to be sure . " Cliffs in jail , " Rob Moore said to Elway , " and it looks to me like the kid is n't his , either . " Elway shook his blond head in mock concern , situating himself atop a training table for the pre-practice ankle-taping ritual , a chore performed at Stanford by attractive young women trainers . " Too bad about your friend , " a concerned bystander said . " What friend ? " Elway said . " Cliff . The guy in jail . The cuckold . " Raucous young laughter . " Oh , that 's a soap-opera character . Rob and I always keep track of his latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . " // Moore reappeared with more bad news . " And I had a flat last night out " by the lake . " Elway laughed . " Rob is his own soap opera , " he said . " Let 's see , what 've you had now  --  a broken neck , a bum knee and a flat tire . Not bad for three years of football . " // " They 're taking money to see when I 'll go down this year , " Moore , a fullback , said , smiling gravely . // Moore and Elway were joined by Darrin Nelson , the bubbly nonesuch halfback , whose hand was being bandaged by one of the trainers . " How 'd that happen ? " Elway inquired . " Well , " said Nelson , warming to the occasion , " these three big dudes had me cornered last night , and by the time I 'd punched them all out , my hand got hurt . " He paused reflectively , checking the reaction of the comely trainer . " Actually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players , particularly those attending schools like Stanford , where classroom attendance is considered de rigueur , are a curious bunch out of armor  --  giant bodies topped by the heads of earnest schoolboys . From the neck up , Elway , who is considered by professional scouts to be the hottest college passer since Bert Jones , could be Andy Hardy , or Jody Baxter in The Yearling . His hair falls like straw over an unlined forehead . His blue eyes are clear and his mouth , thick-lipped , is filled with alabaster teeth . That 's the head . The rest of him is pure pro quarterback  --  lanky ( 6 ' 4 " , 202 ) , long-limbed , the chest of a weightlifter . Watching him fire his passes , reading about his record-shattering performances , one is likely to forget that this superman is , at 21 , still a boy . // Jim Fassel , Stanford 's offensive coordinator , addressed the offensive unit before the final practice the week of Stanford 's opening game with Purdue . He spoke football-ese . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... Passes should be called away from the roll of the Cowboy coverage .... If they 're playing the short post , we 'll go to the shake .... " Elway and Moore were sitting together , kids in class foggily absorbing the arcanum . The coach reverted to English . " Let 's have some fun out there . Hey , we 're good . Practice is short today , one hour . We 'll finish with the two-minute drill . " Elway , daydreaming , became a Bob &amp; Ray creation . " Uh , will we be doing the two-minute drill ? " he asked . " He just got through saying that , " Moore said , gleefully jumping on the gaffe . " Our peerless leader , " the front row moaned in chorus . " I do n't know how I missed that , " said the red-faced peerless leader . // Elway may be inattentive on occasion , but he is , according to the experts , a forward passer possibly without peer . Last season he set Pac-10 Conference records for touchdown passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ran for four ) and total offense ( 2,939 yards ) plus a single-game mark for TD passes ( six against Oregon State ) and TD passes in a quarter ( four , also against the Beavers ) , which also equaled an NCAA record . He was one of the handful of quarterbacks ever to be named All-America as a sophomore . Against Purdue this year he set personal highs by completing 33 of 44 passes for 418 yards . Against Ohio State he rallied Stanford to a near-upset by completing 21 of 27 second-half passes , including nine in a row late in the third and early in the fourth quarters . Only a fumble after a reception by second-team Halfback Vincent White stopped a last-minute Stanford drive and preserved Ohio State 's win . // Alas , his ankle injury , which he suffered against Purdue , sorely limited Elway 's mobility and forced him to alter his passing motion  --  instead of throwing with his whole body , he was using almost all arm and wrist  --  in the first four games , and he played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , albeit completing 10 of 17 passes for 270 yards and three touchdowns , before chipping the bone in his hand and suffering the concussion . Despite all of these handicaps , his performance has been , in its own way , fully as remarkable as the gaudier one of the previous season . // " I 've learned a lot this year , " Elway , ever cheerful , says . " You learn more from losing , I think . Your patience sure gets tested , for one thing . And I 've learned self-control . I 've learned to deal with frustration . It 's a new situation for me  --  losing . It demonstrates how much the quarterback depends on the people around him . I 'm determined to finish this season on a winning note . Then we 'll come out fired up for next year . " // Stanford 's dismal showing has in no way cooled the ardor professional scouts feel for the quarterback . " I 've been in this business 20 years , and I 'd have to say that Elway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony Razzano , director of college scouting for the 49ers . " At this point , that is . He 's the best junior I 've ever seen . And sometimes when a player does n't seem to have the accompaniment he might , you ca n't let it bother you that they 're 2-7 . You ca n't really say Elway has n't produced . " When relatively healthy , as he was last week against Oregon State , Elway vindicates his backers . Playing only 2 quarters of the 63-9 win , Elway completed 15 of 20 passes for 245 yards and three touchdowns. // " Elway 's got everything going for him , no negatives to speak of , " says Tom Braatz , director of player personnel for the Falcons . " His possibilities are unlimited , " says Gil Brandt , the Cowboys ' head of personnel development . " He 's an outstanding athlete , with the kind of physical ability that could make a Bert Jones-or a Terry Bradshaw-type of quarterback . " Of the injuries and the losses Brandt says , " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he were a senior he 'd still be the first guy picked in the draft . " // College coaches speak of him as if he were discovered in the bullrushes . After he threw for three touchdowns ( and ran for another ) in Stanford 's stunning 31-14 upset of Oklahoma in Norman last season , Sooner Coach Barry Switzer said , " John Elway put on the greatest exhibition of quarterback play and passing I 've ever seen on this field . " When asked to compare Elway with Ohio State 's Art Schlichter , UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said , " It 's like comparing apples and oranges . If you ask me who I 'd least like to face , it 's John Elway . " Speculating on Elway 's future in professional football , Stanford Coach Paul Wiggin , himself a former Stanford All-America and All-Pro defensive end with the Browns , said , " He 's a franchise , an automatic . I played with John Brodie here at Stanford , and John was one of the truly great players in the game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development , he could n't compare with John Elway. " // The first week he stepped on a practice field as a freshman in 1979 , Elway scared off two top quarterback prospects , Babe Laufenberg and Grayson Rogers , who quickly transferred to other schools  --  Laufenberg to Indiana , by way of Pierce Junior College in L.A. , Rogers to the University of the Pacific  --  and both have started at quarterback . Turk Schonert , a senior then , now with the Cincinnati Bengals , who had patiently waited his turn through the Guy Benjamin ( 49ers ) and Steve Dils ( Vikings ) eras , was almost equally threatened by the freshman flamethrower . " Turk felt the pressure , no question , " says Fassel . Schonert merely led the nation in passing that year . He almost had to in order to stave off Elway . " If you can play ahead of John Elway , " says Fassel , " you 're a great quarterback , and I do n't care if you are a senior and he is only a freshman . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has missed every game this year because of a broken foot , has played with Benjamin , Dils and Schonert and Elway . " I do n't think any of the others could be rated with John , " he says . " He is clearly in a class by himself . // " The difference is in the raw physical talent , the ability to throw the ball . Steve , Guy , Turk and Jim Plunkett all worked out here with receivers this summer , and not one of them wanted to throw after John . There are situations in a game when most quarterbacks would not be physically able to even think about doing what Elway does routinely . You can be surrounded by defenders , and John will get the ball to you . He can throw that hard and that accurately . He throws so hard that it was a problem for us receivers at first . He was throwing the ball twice as fast as anyone I 'd ever seen . It was the difference between catching a 90-mile-an-hour fastball and a changeup . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards , and he could throw it 85 yards if he had to . For a while the coaches debated whether to ask him to soften up . Finally they came to us and said , ' We 're not going to ask John to change . It 's up to you to adjust . He 's our man . ' We adjusted . We learned to concentrate on the ball more , to secure it before we took off . " // Wiggin invites skeptics to stand behind his quarterback at practice and observe the awesome projectiles firsthand . " I 've been standing behind quarterbacks all my life , " he says , " and I 've never seen anyone who can make it happen the way this kid does . " Elway warms up , lofting lazy spirals to his receivers ; then , gradually , he cranks up to full velocity . In the end there is just a flick of the wrist and the ball is there , yards away . The receivers , cold at first , drop passes by the dozen . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch it goes out the window with John , " says Fassel . In time the receivers adjust , and Elway is hitting them with fastballs from 30 to 40 yards out , the ball fairly whistling as it leaves his right hand . It 's an eye-opening spectacle . Elway throws footballs the way Nolan Ryan throws baseballs . Wiggin shrugs , smiling an I-told-you-so smile . // No other college or university , not even Notre Dame , has produced more quality T-formation quarterbacks than Stanford . It is a tradition of excellence that began in 1940 with Frankie Albert , the first of the modern-day T quarterbacks , and continued through Brodie , Plunkett , Benjamin , Dils and Schonert . Sprinkled in among these illuminati were some lesser-knowns who also had exceptional careers : Gary Kerkorian , Bobby Garrett , Dick Norman ( who in 1959 completed 34 of 39 passes for 401 yards against California ) , Dave Lewis , Mike Boryla and Don Bunce , all of whom went on to play professional football . // Stanford immortals peer down at the current aspirants from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the snug athletic-department building . No quarterback who has ever played in Palo Alto has escaped the subtle pressure applied by these ghosts . But in his junior season , Elway has moved into second place in touchdown passes ( 48 ) behind Plunkett , and into third place in passing yardage ( 5,635 ) and completions ( 474 ) behind Plunkett and Benjamin . Barring further injury , and if he continues at his current pace Elway should finish at the top of the list in every significant Stanford passing statistic , including Plunkett 's imposing 7,544 total yards . Then , if he plays professional football , he will take aim at the accomplishments of his Stanford predecessors  --  Albert 's 29 TD passes in 1948 , Brodie 's 30 touchdown passes in 1965 and 31,548 yards gained passing and Plunkett 's 1981 Super Bowl championship . // What 's that ? If he plays professional football ? With NFL scouts forming entire rooting sections and with big bucks being squirreled away to entice him , what could keep Elway from playing pro football ? The New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar contract immediately after Stanford 's second game this season , the loss to San Jose State . Under its terms , Elway will play for a six-figure salary next summer , after the school term , for the Class-A Oneonta ( N.Y. ) team . In doing so he will lose his football scholarship , but , under current NCAA rules , no football eligibility . He will no longer be able to play baseball for Stanford , because the rules do prohibit a student from playing the same sport professionally and in college . This could even prove to be a boon for Wiggin and the football staff , for Elway will now be free to devote his attention to spring football exclusively . Freedom from the double dose of college baseball and spring football  --  one Saturday , Elway completed 65% of his passes in a morning football scrimmage and went 3 for 4 against USC in the afternoon  --  will permit him to , as he puts it , " act more like a college student and not like a guy running from one field to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will provide him with " a nice summer job . " // The Yankees are gambling , of course . Elway has told them that , as of now , he prefers playing professional football , so they have no real assurance of signing him to a longer-term contract when his college eligibility has expired . They are also gambling that he will not be seriously injured playing college football , and they will soon be involved in what could be a multimillion-dollar bidding war with whatever NFL team drafts him . By signing him for this year , the Yankees are simply preserving their draft rights and ensuring that they will be the only major league team that can sign him . Had they not signed him by the end of September after drafting him in the second round when he turned 21 , Elway , in the words of a Yankee spokesman , " would 've gone back in the hopper . " Is the estimated $140,000 they will be paying him for six weeks or so of minor league baseball worth it ? The Yankees think so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing footballs , Elway is a remarkable baseball player . In his last two seasons at Granada Hills High near Los Angeles , he batted .551 and .491 and was voted the Southern California CIF Baseball Player of the Year his senior year . Although he had already committed himself to attending Stanford , the Kansas City Royals drafted him in the 18th round after high school . He had a disappointing ( .269 ) freshman season but came back this past spring to hit .361 with nine homers and 50 RBIs in 49 games . In the NCAA Central Regionals he hit .444 and was voted onto the all-tournament team . He is a polished right-fielder with , naturally , a powerful arm . // " If he played nine months of the year instead of three or four , there is no telling how good he could be , " says Stanford Baseball Coach Mark Marquess . " It 's significant that he really starts playing well toward the end of the season , in the pressure games . He 's a true clutch performer . It 's incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time . He 'd have football practice in the morning , miss batting practice , then tear the cover off the ball in the game . He 's just an amazingly gifted athlete ... and he 's got that cannon for an arm . " // A lefthand hitter with power , Elway is " made for Yankee Stadium , " says Bill Bergesch , Yankee vice-president for baseball operations , who made three recruiting trips to Stanford and watched nervously as the San Jose State team abused his prize prospect , sacking him seven times . " We project him as a superstar . He 's got everything a scout looks for  --  he 's big and strong , he can run , he can hit and hit with power , and he 's got that strong arm . We see him as our right-fielder down the road . Unfortunately , we are also aware he has some talent in football . " // The Yankees , says Bergesch , realize they are playing a long shot , but they are counting on the glamour and tradition that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll take him to our training camp during his spring vacation , " says Bergesch . " Our eyes are open . We know how important football is to him . It 's the glamour sport in college . But we 'll have the chance to show him what a career in baseball can be like . He 'll meet some of our star players . We would n't take this gamble if we did n't think we could sign him . And we 're not hurting Stanford at all . I know one thing , whatever pro football team drafts him had better know that the Yankees will be there . We 're not bowing out of this thing lightly . We 'll be there . " // Elway 's negotiator in his dealings with the Yankees and his closest confidant in all things is his father . Jack , 50 . Theirs is a father-son relationship abounding in mutual respect and admiration . It is a relationship marred , however , by an accident of fate : Jack Elway is the head football coach at San Jose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Palo Alto and is a traditional Stanford football opponent . The annual meetings between the son 's and the father 's football teams are an excruciatingly painful experience for the entire Elway family , which includes wife-mother Janet and daughters-sisters Lee Ann and Jana . " The season begins for all of us , " says Jana , John 's twin , " after that game . " " It 's hard on the whole family , " says John , " particularly my mother . It 's Dad 's job , after all , and the family has always been centered around him . This thing is a whole lot worse for us than people think . " // Jack Elway 's 28-year coaching career began at the high school level in his native state of Washington . After four years as an assistant at Washington State he became head coach at Cal State-Northridge at the time his son blossomed as a high school football hero . In December of 1978 , Jack accepted the San Jose job . // Son John graduated from Granada Hills High the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stanford , Notre Dame , USC , Washington and ... San Jose State . Jack Elway had privately tutored his son but had never coached him at any level ( he may finally get his chance as coach of the West team in the January , 1983 East-West Shrine Game at Stanford ) , and like many fathers who are also coaches , he scrupulously refused to interfere with any of John 's coaches . Only once did he speak up on his son 's behalf , and that only after an assistant coach in high school had struck the 16-year-old during practice . " I told that guy he could apologize now or meet me outside and get the bleep kicked out of him , or he could wait until John turned 21 and have him kick the bleep out of him . He apologized. " // John had developed a yearning to play in the Pac-10 during his father 's years at Washington State . The move to California made him more a fan of Stanford , the quarterback 's school , than of USC , the tailback 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pac-10 since he was 12 , " said Jack one recent afternoon before his own football practice . " And I knew that . Stanford was always his first choice . The only advice I gave him was to go to a school that was solid academically John is majoring in Economics and that had quality coaches . I told him when the time came he should make his own decision and never look back . He 's done that and he 's happy and I 'm proud of him . " // Jack removed his blue SJS baseball cap and fanned himself with it . " We , of course , were in the process of recruiting a quarterback at the time , since Ed Luther now with the San Diego Chargers was in his last year . I tell people that my offer to John was $2,000 under the table , a new car and a mortgage on the house . I said I would go so far as to have an affair with his mother . Still , he did n't go for it . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that if I had said , ' John , come with me to San Jose , ' he would 've come , but that would n't have been fair to him . Still , there are nights , after I 've had about three vodka martinis , when I 'll say to myself , ' Jack , old boy , you 've got to be the dumbest sumbitch in this whole world . You had the best quarterback in America sitting across the breakfast table from you and you let him get away . ' " // Father and son remain each other 's biggest boosters for all but one week of the year . They talk by phone or in the family home in San Jose several times a week during football season  --  except when San Jose is playing Stanford . Before this season 's game they made a public appearance together at a football writers ' luncheon in San Francisco . " I 've been a fan of my dad 's all my life , but when it comes down to this game , I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last year , no kidding , Dad gave me San Jose 's first play of the game , a quarterback draw . I told Coach Harbaugh Stanford defensive coordinator Jack Harbaugh what it was going to be and he said , ' Yeah , sure . ' Well , it was a quarterback draw , and the coach and I just looked at each other . This year , I do n't know whether I can trust the old man . " // Said Jack , " Sure I 'll tell him the play when I know it . That 's what makes us so effective . We never know what we 're doing on offense . " Such jocularity masks the genuine anguish both men feel on the week they must play each other . John was significantly absent from a family gathering two nights before the San Jose game . This was the week for Elway schizophrenia . " We 're all confused , " said Janet Elway , a stately blonde . She hoisted the family dog , a spunky black poodle , to her lap . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You do n't care what happens as long as John comes home to play with you on the floor . " // " The kids were all born at once  --  18 months apart for all three , " said Jack , sipping his vodka martini . " I like to tell people I got married , had a honeymoon for 18 months and then all hell broke loose the next 18 . But having the twins was quite a thrill , and all of the kids , being so close to the same age , developed a special bond . Even as little kids , I can remember John crawling on the floor by himself , then looking around to see where Jana was and crawling right over to her . And then the two of them would start jabbering at each other in that special language twins have . " // " It 's so strange now , " said Janet . " John comes home here and sprawls all over the furniture , making a mess of things , destroying the whole house . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's like he 's two different people . " // The only opponent to hold John to under 200 yards passing last season was San Jose State . This year , against his father 's team , John suffered through the worst day of his career , completing only six of 24 passes for 72 yards , hardly a quarter 's work for him on a normal outing . He threw five interceptions and was sacked the seven times , the combination of his offensive line breaking down and his own sprained ankle leaving John a virtual sitting duck . The San Jose victory was one of the most important in the school 's football history and its first over Stanford in six years . For Jack Elway it was the triumph of a lifetime and , along with last year 's upset of Baylor , led to speculation that more than one Elway might be joining the NFL one day . // For John , it was the low point of his young career . Janet Elway smiled and embraced her husband after the game , then , spotting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a San Jose junior , wore a hat that had the Stanford emblem and colors on one side and San Jose State 's on the other . She did n't know whether to laugh or cry . // At the final gun John limped across the field to throw an arm around his father . They walked tearfully together out the south end of Stanford Stadium . Jack Elway drank a Pepsi with shaking hands as he met the press under the trees outside the San Jose locker room . His blitzing linebackers had given his son a terrible beating in helping Jack to his biggest win . His manner was deadly serious . " How do I feel ? " He hunched his shoulders . " As a father , I 'm not very goddamn happy . As a coach , I 'm thrilled . I thought John showed great courage . He was obviously injured . " Later , he would bitterly criticize the Stanford coaches  --  most of whom are his close friends  --  for leaving his son in the game so long when he should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was John , driven by God knows what competitive forces , who had insisted upon playing in pain . // The following week , still limping , he rebounded from an indifferent first half ( 7 for 15 for 55 yards ) against Ohio State to complete 28 of 42 for 248 yards and two touchdowns . His rival , the much-publicized Schlichter , was 16 for 32 for 240 yards and two TDs . But Schlichter , who also had an ankle injury , tailed off in the second half , while Elway rallied Stanford to near-victory. // This season 's Stanford Cardinals are scarcely the touchdown-happy bunch of a year ago . Elway 's best receiver in 1981 , Ken Margerum , has gone to the Chicago Bears , and Tyler , his second best , has yet to play . Nelson , who ran for 1,000 yards and caught 50 passes in both his freshman and sophomore years , has been bothered by a bruised hip he suffered in the first quarter of the Purdue game , and the young offensive line is n't providing Elway with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to frustration , as in the Ohio State game . Elway 's performance against the Buckeyes would have been even more extraordinary had his receivers not dropped at least four catchable passes , one a perfectly thrown 50-yarder which Tight End Chris Dressel muffed in the open field . With his team trailing by five points and 6:55 left in the game , Elway 's ankle was reinjured . He missed one series of downs and then returned , the reincarnation of Frank Merriwell , for the final minute and 33 seconds of play . From his own 16 he completed passes of 22 yards to Eric Mullins and nine yards to Moore before dumping off a swing pass to White , who fumbled the ball away with 54 seconds left . // For Elway there will be other games , in either football or baseball . He will soon become one of those rare athletes whose services are in demand in two professional sports . He has , in that sense , a future without limitations . Whatever choice he makes , the child 's head will stay straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought up right , " Wiggin says . " They 're still games , " says John . " They 're still fun . The more attention I get , the more I like my privacy . There 's no sense in trying to live up to other people 's expectations of me. " // " John is mentally tough and he 's physically tough , " says Jack Elway , whose own future has so recently been enhanced at the expense of his son . " But more important than all that , he 's a damn good person . "
