 | I knew something was bothering my husband , Jim , as soon as I got home from work that night , but it was n't until the kids were in bed that he had a chance to tell me about it . " Remember , Betty , I once told you I had a brother who died a long time ago ? " my husband asked . " Well , he 's come alive . Mom got a letter today from somebody at the probate court . " Jim 's face was kind of flushed , and I noticed he 'd been biting his fingernails . Jim 's ordinarily not a worrier . But news of this kind might get to anyone ? especially someone as wonderful as my loving Jim Springer who , at 39 , already has about as much family as he can handle . Jim and I have two children : Stephanie , nine , and Jimmy , six . My husband also helps support his two teenage daughters , Lee Anne and Lisa , from his first marriage . His job with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much , even after 20 years . That 's why I work four hours a day as a waitress ? something I hate , hate , HATE . What I 'd really love is to be able to stay home all the time , just taking care of little Jimmy and Stephanie and cooking up a storm for Jim . Of course , I remembered hearing about Jim 's " dead " brother ? his twin brother . On one of our first dates he 'd told me the story ? that he was adopted ; that Mom and Dad Springer had taken him home from the hospital when he was only five weeks old ; that they 'd wanted to adopt his twin brother , too , but had been told the other twin had died . As for Jim 's " real " mother , Mom Springer had passed along all she knew : His mother was a 14-year-old Italian girl who 'd turned up half-starved at the hospital in Piqua , Ohio , to have her babies and then had disappeared as mysteriously as she 'd come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Neither Jim nor I did much sleeping that night . The next day , Jim decided not to go to work . but to drive to Piqua ? it 's about an hour from where we live in Dayton ? to pick up the letter from Mom Springer and to see what he could learn from officials at the courthouse . When Jim came home that night he was really churning . Someone at the courthouse had dug up his adoption papers and confirmed that yes , he had had a twin brother . And the twin had not died . The twin had been adopted when he was a baby by Lucille and Jess Lewis of Lima , Ohio . Just within the last month , a Jim Lewis , age 39 , from  | Lima had made inquiries at the courthouse about a long-lost brother and had left a telephone number for Jim Springer to call ? if the court ever found him . The first thing my husband did was to fortify himself with a couple of beers . Then he dialed the number that would put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He dialed again . Still no answer . Finally a recording came on the line : " The number you 're calling is no longer in service . For further assistance , please dial your operator . " The only trouble was that the operator could n't provide any " further " assistance . My poor husband was so undone by then that he was ready to write the whole thing off as a mean practical joke . But if my Jim was tempted to give up , I was n't . I spent more than an hour on the phone that Friday night until I finally got a supervisory operator on the line . I told her the whole story and begged ? yes , begged ? her to find Jim Lewis for us and give him our number . And that 's just what she did , bless her . Otherwise the Jim twins might never have found each other and their amazing similarities ? in looks , in temperament , in manner ? might never have been known . On Monday , February 5 , Jim Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel plant in Lima . After that , he had a date with the woman who was soon to become his wife . Her name was Sandy Jacobs and she was the kind of person Jim Lewis , after two unhappy marriages , had almost given up hope of ever finding . When Jim got to Sandy 's house that night , she was bursting with news . Earlier in the day the telephone company , unable to find Jim Lewis , had called Larry Lewis , one of Jim 's brothers by adoption , and had left word that Jim Lewis should call Jim Springer in Dayton at a certain number as soon as possible . Larry had relayed the message to Sandy , and she had been waiting all evening to pass it along to Jim . To her surprise , her Jim was in no hurry to place the call . In fact , he was so nervous about the situation that he even considered forgetting about the whole thing . ( Shades of my Jim ! ) " What if this guy turns out to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freeloader ? Or just somebody I 'd rather I 'd never met ? " Sandy said what she 'd been saying for the last three months , " Is n't it better to know than to keep on guessing ? " When Jim Lewis said maybe he 'd rather let sleeping dogs lie , she would have none of it . Finally she found an argument that worked : " Maybe your brother will turn out to be just like you . I ca n't think of anything that would make me happier than to have two of you . " It was past midnight when Jim Lewis placed his call . My Jim and I were in bed watching TV . When the phone rang my husband grabbed it . For two men who are as openly emotional ( you might even say sentimental ) as I now know both Jims are , that was a pretty strange conversation . My Jim barked , " Hello . " Then , " Yes , my name 's Jim Springer . " Jim Lewis gave his name and then came right out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yup , I guess I must be , " my Jim said . That was about all there was to it , except that Jim Lewis said he 'd drive down to Dayton the coming Friday evening and my Jim said we 'd both be waiting for him . The next four days were rough . From what I heard later from Sandy , they were n't exactly peaches and cream in Lima either . My husband is the kindest , nicest , most generous man alive . He almost never gets mad , or at least he does n't show it . ( I 'm the exact opposite . I can get mad at anything ? even at Jim just because he 's perfect and I 'm anything but . ) I know he 's under a strain when he starts biting his fingernails , or jiggling his foot or when his high blood pressure acts up . That week all the storm signals were flying . What seemed to bother him most was the possibility that Jim Lewis might prove to be physically handicapped ? that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transplant . Meanwhile , in Lima , Jim Lewis was sweating out the same fears . He knew he 'd been a sickly baby and something had been so wrong with his legs he had n't been able to walk until he was past two years old . Now , waiting for the meeting with his twin brother , he kept wondering " whether the guy would turn out to be a cripple . " Like my Jim , the other Jim is a man of many responsibilities ? he has three children , James Alan , Jeff and Timmie from his second marriage , and Sandy has two youngsters , Jeff and Kelly , who would soon be Jim 's stepchildren . The thought of having somebody else to support worried him . Jim Lewis asked his brother Larry and Larry 's wife , Marie , to drive to Dayton with Sandy and him to meet us . When they arrived at our house , Jim Lewis drove past it three times before he had the courage to stop . All this time my husband and I and the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of suspense . I was looking out the window when they finally pulled up . I opened the door for them ? and was dumbfounded at what I saw . Jim Lewis looked so much like my Jim that I thought I was seeing double . My husband said later , " It was like seeing myself in a mirror . " Not only did they look alike ? they walked alike , crossed their legs the same way , laughed alike , talked alike . But for the first few minutes they were both so flabbergasted that they could n't talk at all . They both just stood there ? staring at each other . Then suddenly the ice broke as all of us started talking , laughing and hugging at the same time ? overwhelmed by the realization that we were a family ? maybe the biggest , happiest , closest , laughingest , huggingest family in the whole state of Ohio . The worrying was over . I just stood there , mouth open , having a very private and ? I suppose ? very female reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I set eyes on Jim Springer and fell head over heels in love at first sight . Now it was as if I were falling in love all over again . Our daughter , Stephanie , rushed up to kiss her father and ended up kissing the wrong Jim . When things quieted down , the Jim  | twins went into the kitchen to talk and left the rest of us in the living room . During a lull in our conversation , Sandy suddenly said , " Listen ! See if you can figure out which Jim is saying what . " We could n't . Their voices and inflections are so alike that you ca n't tell who 's talking unless you see their lips . That 's true of the words they use too . " Mamma mia , " for example , and " dig " and " cool . " When my Jim took his brother down to see his basement workshop , he learned that Jim Lewis is as hooked on working with wood as he is . Our backyard is full of birdhouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we visited the Lewises in Lima , we found the other Jim working on a picnic table for Sandy . Of course we all knew the Jims were twins . What we did n't know , until it was established by exhaustive tests at the University of Minnesota , was that they were identical twins . Identical twins result when a single fertilized egg separates for some unknown reason between the first and tenth day after conception . Two eggs then continue to grow in the mother 's womb , and each egg carries all the hereditary factors so the two babies are exactly alike . That means psychologically as well as physically . One expert has written , " When identical twins are apart they actually experience a sense of incompleteness . " After the Lewises went home that first night , my Jim and I sat up a long time talking . I remember how high he was ? elated , I guess you could say ? and yet calm at the same time . " I 've always felt there was something missing from my life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of emptiness that is n't there anymore . " Later I learned that Jim Lewis told Sandy , " Up to now I 've always felt left out . Now I know why ? I was missing my own twin . " Some weeks later Jim Lewis sent my Jim a greeting card . There was a drawing of a cat in a garbage can and the words , Until you came along . . . and then on the inside , I never felt wanted . Underneath Jim Lewis wrote , I love you very much . My Jim choked up when he read it . So did I the next week when my husband showed me a letter from his twin with a message for me . You tell Betty , he wrote , she does n't make a good sister-in-law , but one hell of a sweet sister . I love her very much . ( I 've never been close to my own brother , so that really got to me . ) Not long afterward , I got a letter of my own from Jim Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Sealed With a Kiss ) and I remember wondering what the mailman must have thought . Across the top of the page he had written , To my sister who is sweet , sexie ( neither Jim is much good at spelling ) , wonderful , fantastic , incredible , beautiful , lovable and everything else . In the letter he wrote , There are no words to say how much I wanted my brother before , and no words for how I felt when I first met him . Now there is no end to the love I feel for him . . .. God must have meant it to be this way . There is one big difference between the twins . Sandy 's Jim puts his feelings on paper and mine speaks his . Jim Lewis is also very religious and talks about God a lot . He never skips church , but I 'm afraid we do . I 'm getting ahead of my story . About a week after the Jim twins found each other , Mom and Dad Springer gave a party at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance 1 'd had to meet my Lewis relatives . I found them fabulous , but it was n't easy to keep track of who was who . Between them , the Jims have seven children , five brothers and sisters , three parents and one stepparent . ( Jim Lewis ' father died some years ago and his mother remarried . ) Nearly everyone turned out for the party . So did a bunch of reporters and photographers from newspapers , TV and magazines . Believe me , it was wild , with 22 excited people talking at once in one tiny living room . Jim Lewis ' mother , Lucille Cheney , who had come all the way from Florida , was probably the most excited of all . " I had the strangest tingling sensation running up and down my spine , and my stomach felt as if there were a rock in it , " she said later of the party . " For a while I thought I was going to faint , but all I did was cry and cry . " Mom Springer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get over how much those two boys look alike and how they both have the same friendly , loving nature . " Mrs. Cheney and I had a long talk . She told me how she 'd fed Jim Lewis with an eyedropper for the first five months she 'd had him , and how she had been afraid he 'd never be able to walk . She also told me how she 'd discovered that the other twin had n't died . When she went to the courthouse to register her baby 's name , the clerk blurted out . " Oh , you ca n't call him James . That 's what they named the other little boy . " As soon as Lucille thought her adopted son was old enough to understand . she told him he had a brother . But the news did n't seem to penetrate , so she followed her husband 's advice and let the matter drop . When Jim Lewis turned 21 , she mentioned the brother again , but he still did n't seem interested . " He 's never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me . Then last winter , Jim Lewis ' buried longing for his twin overcame his natural conservatism . In January 1979. after a lot of prodding from Sandy , he took his adoption papers to the courthouse in Piqua and launched a search for his brother . That 's when the courts wrote Mom Springer . The two mothers hit it off beautifully . probably because they have so much in common . Both are down-to-earth , good people and adore kids . Even though neither of them ever had enough money . they had each adopted not one , but houseful of children . When Jim Lewis was four , Mrs. Cheney took the twins Larry and Gary . Mom Springer got special permit from a judge to be able to take in three homeless youngsters ? two brothers and a sister ? in addition to my Jim . In many ways the mothers are like pioneer women ? no work is toe much for them and there 's no bottom to their hearts . After the Springer party , things moved  | awfully fast for us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my Jim acting as best man . After that , the twins started flying all over the U.S. for TV appearances . ( They did the Johnny Carson show , the Mike Douglas Show and others . ) In March , the four of us spent an expense-paid week in Minneapolis so that Dr. Thomas Bouchard of the University of Minnesota could study the Jims up add down , backward and forward and inside and out . Dr. Bouchard wanted to learn as much as possible about the Jims , hoping their differences and likenesses might help unravel the mysteries of heredity and environment . Science previously knew of only 19 pairs of identical twins who 've grown up separately in the U.S. , and none have been apart as long as Jim Lewis and Jim Springer . Dr. Bouchard calls them " the most valuable pair that has ever been studied . " Before we returned to Ohio , a member of the research team said to Sandy and me that he bet he knew more about our husbands than we do . I 'm not so sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husbands are ; how nothing makes . them happier than telling us what we mean to them and showing us ? by giving us gifts ( that they ca n't afford ) and by touching and patting and holding hands . To this day Sandy and I keep stumbling on things they both do that are positively spooky . For example : Last week Sandy came home from work to find a note addressed , To my loving wife , propped up on a shelf in the hall closet . She found another love note in her bedroom , a third inside the meat keeper in her refrigerator , a fourth on top of the TV set ? plus a package wrapped in sentimental birthday paper . Inside was a nameplate for her desk at the office and a card which said , I know it 's not your birthday , sweetheart , but the way I feel about you I want to give you a present every day of the year . That very day , I found a message from my Jim pinned on the kitchen bulletin board . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim must have written from his office the day before . Hi , sweetheart , it read . Have a good day and do n't work too hard . 1 love you and miss you . ( I 'm not going to tell you what the bulletinboard message said , but it made me very happy . ) That afternoon when I punched in at the restaurant where I work , a bunch of violets was waiting for me . I know we ca n't afford these , Jim 's note said , but what the hell ! You 're worth it . I 'll bet no amount of testing could ever turn up that story . Last winter a reporter asked me a question which she thought was funny , but I did n't ? not at the time and even less now that I 've had a chance to think about it . She pointed out that both Jims were first married to women named Linda . Then they both had second wives named Betty . Jim Lewis now has a third wife named Sandy . Then she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Sandy were to catch your husband 's eye ? Would you do some big worrying ? " I was so upset by the gall of the question that I could n't come up with the kind of scorching answer it deserved . Instead , I just mumbled , " No . " But now I have an answer . I 'm not worried about anyone named Sandy or anything else . Jim Springer and I have loved each other for almost 10 years and we 're going to keep right on loving each other ? as husband and wife ? for the rest of our lives . Jim is a one-woman man and I know it . His first marriage was just one of those mistakes anyone can make . Ours is no mistake . And , believe it or not , Jim Lewis is a one-woman man too . The only difference is that it took him a little longer than my Jim to find the woman who is right for him . Now that he 's found Sandy ? and she 's found him ? it 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
