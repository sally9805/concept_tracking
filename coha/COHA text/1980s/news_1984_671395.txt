The Wilberg Mine , about 150 miles east of here , continues to burn unimpeded and the dead are nearly a mile and a half inside it . Efforts to remove the bodies were halted Sunday because of the dangerous buildup of carbon monoxide , carbon dioxide and methane gases. // Crews began work Wednesday to seal off outlying parts of the mine , but will not be able to begin work in the main areas until this weekend , according to Robert Henrie , a spokesman for the Emery Mining Company , which operates the mine. // The blaze broke out Dec. 19 about a mile into the mine . The 27 miners who died were working about 2 , 200 feet further into the tunnel when the firebegan. // Methane gas is odorless and tasteless , but can cause explosions when fire and extreme heat are present . Small fire balls , described as " burps , " have been coming from mine openings since the mine was evacuated Sunday . <> <> Gas Pockets in Coal Seams // The gas is found in pockets within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The burning coal also produced carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. // Mr. Henrie said the company ' s proposal for extinguishing the blaze , which was submitted to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration , called for the sealing of 12 to 15 portals within the mine , including the main entrance. // " We hope to make it as airtight as possible , " Mr. Henrie said. // He said the Wilberg Mine had " dozens of miles of tunnels . " Some areas , where the fire has already burned , are devoid of oxygen and will not be sealed , he said. // Once sealed , the mine must remain closed for at least 72 hours , according to Federal law . Mr. Henrie said it would probably take longer to smother the fire . He said the company had not been able to determine how long the mine would be sealed. // He said the fire would be monitored by equipment installed through bore holes . Once the equipment is installed , the holes are to be capped also . <> <> U.S. Seeking Cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mine Safety and Health Administration , said his agency was investigating to determine how the fire began. // It is believed to have started in an area where two conveyer belts meet . One belt transported coal about 700 yards from where a crew was working to another belt that connected to the outside. // That crew of miners , all but one of whom were among the dead , was reported to be attempting to set a 24-hour production record for long-wall mining . The production of their eight-hour shift would have been combined with the production of two other shifts for a 24-hour total . The record , held by a crew from a mine operated by the Kaiser Steel Company in neighboring Carbon County , is just under 25 , 000 tons. // Mr. Henrie said he could not confirm that a record attempt was being made , but he said company officials " are comfortable " with such activities . He said mining was a competitive business , and miners were encouraged to be efficient . He added that safety was never sacrificed. // A miner is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and can earn up to $600 more a month through increased production . <> <> How Long-Wall Machine Works // A long-wall machine is like a giant chain saw , hundreds of feet long . The machine creeps slowly , harvesting coal along a seam . Work starts at the back of a tunnel and moves toward the mine entrance . The roof is held up with hydraulic jacks , which are moved ahead along with the machine ' s blade . As the machine moves forward , the ceiling collapses behind it . A long-wall machine is normally worked by a crew of 20 miners. // " The long-wall mining system is the most technologically advanced in the world , " Mr. Henrie said. // Long-wall machines are generally assembled piece by piece , often taking a month to construct . Such a machine can recover more coal from a seam than a smaller , more mobile piece of mining equipment , the continuous miner , that is often used. // Because of the difficult working conditions in a mine , a long-wall machine usually runs only one-and-a-half to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Production records can only be set if a machine is running smoothly and the condition of the coal and other factors are exactly right , they say. // " You could set a production record every time you went out if you ran that miner for the whole eight hours , " Mr. O ' Gorman said. // In an attempt at a production record , Mr. O ' Gorman said , " it isn ' t that you do anything different , you do things on a continuous basis and it must be done perfectly. " // When the fire broke out , 90 miners who were in sections of the mine not blocked by the blaze , were able to escape . One miner , Kenneth Blake , who was working behind the fire also made his way to safety . <> <> ' Can ' t See Boot Tops ' // Rescue workers who went into the mine in the days after the fire found 25 of the 27 bodies , but were unable to remove them . John Serfustini , a spokesman for the Utah Power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescue crews were normally sent in to find survivors and were not even allowed to bend over to check identification clips on bodies that are found . If bodies are recovered , it will be by a separate crew , he said. // The rescuers " can ' t even see their boot tops " because of darkness and smoke , he said . He said they were tethered together , and communicated by whistle. // He said standard operating procedures called for the men to advance five steps , stop , take oxygen and gas readings , search nearby areas , then proceed another five steps . The mine tunnel has been compared to a mile-long closet with no lights and smoke and with flames coming from the walls. // Repeated flareups of the mine fire kept crews from attempting to remove the bodies , and eventually forced full evacuation of the mine . <> <> High-Quality Coal // Coal from the Wilberg Mine is considered among the best in the nation , Mr. O ' Gorman said . It is bituminous , low in sulfur and has a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s generating plants in Utah are coal-fired . The Wilberg Mine is one of three mines owned by the utility . The other two are in the same general locale but do not have contiguous seams. // The 800 miners employed by Emery have all been idle for nine days . The utility ' s Deer Creek Mine was closed as a precaution when numerous bore holes were drilled from it to pump water into the Wilberg Mine . The utility ' s Des- Bee-Dove Mine has been closed since Dec. 29 , 1983 , because of a fire that caused no serious injuries. // //
