LONDON  --  Hill Samuel Group PLC said its group chief executive officer resigned after the British merchant bank decided to pursue merger talks with Union Bank of Switzerland . Christopher Castleman quit Wednesday following the decision by Hill Samuel ' s board to discuss a merger with the big Zurich-based bank . The negotiations with UBS come after months of speculation that the British merchant bank was vulnerable to a takeover . In a statement , the merchant bank said Mr. Castleman " was in disagreement with the board ' s decision to consider proposals which could lead to the loss of independence . " The 46-year-old Mr. Castleman , chief executive since 1980 , wasn ' t available for comment yesterday . Hill Samuel named Sir Robert Clark , chairman , to the additional post of group chief executive . Hill Samuel ' s shares surged on the news of merger talks . The shares traded late yesterday at 676 pence ( $10. 94 ) on London ' s stock exchange , up from 511 pence late Wednesday . At yesterday ' s level , the merchant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( $1. 01 billion ) . The announcement by Hill Samuel may mark the end of its determination to remain independent amid the increasing internationalization of London ' s financial markets . In the past few years , the growth of those markets has led many large overseas financial institutions to expand here , and numerous smaller-capitalized London banks have struggled to remain competitive . If UBS succeeds in its bid for Hill Samuel , the acquisition would represent one of the biggest takeovers of a British merchant bank by an overseas company , according to British bankers . British regulators previously have blocked some bank takeovers by non-British banks . But government officials said yesterday that they expected this combination to receive necessary government approvals . UBS ' s existing London presence gives it an edge over other would-be bidders . A combination of the two banks would create a significantly stronger player in the highly competitive London securities markets . The acquisition would give UBS , one of Switzerland ' s major banks , a much higher profile in Britain ' s investment-banking business . And the banks probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wood Mackenzie and UBS owns Phillips &; Drew , already one of London ' s biggest brokers . UBS " gives us the best opportunity we ' ve seen for a very long time , " said Sir Robert in an interview . The brokerage business " is a very good fit indeed , " he said . The combined firm " will form a very powerful investment bank , " he added . For Hill Samuel , the merger also would end months of uncertainty about its fate . Speculation about the firm ' s vulnerability to a takeover soared early this year after Australian and New Zealand investors began amassing stakes . In early January , NZI Corp. , a New Zealand financial-services company , said it had acquired a 4. 9% stake . Other investors subsequently appeared . Last week , Hill Samuel said that Australian investor Kerry Packer held a 12% stake ; FAI Insurances Ltd. of Sydney , controlled by financier Larry Adler , held a 14. 02% stake , and Robert Holmes a Court , an Australian financier , held just over a 2% stake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NZI had sold its stake . Sir Robert said these investors " will have to put some money on the table " in order to succeed at a bid . " I suspect they are laughing all the way to the bank with a fat profit , " he went on . Still , uncertainty about the fate of the Australian holdings led some analysts yesterday to speculate that another bidder could emerge . UBS " appears something like a white knight " at the moment , said John Tyce , an analyst at London stockbrokers Alexanders Laing &; Cruickshank . The Swiss bank " is seen as someone who will put new capital in . " But Bryce Cottrell , chairman of UBS ' s Phillips &; Drew unit , said in an interview yesterday that he didn ' t expect the Australian holders to mount a counterbid . " They haven ' t been in a hurry to do so . . . . One assumes they have either been warned off or are not rushing into it . " He added that UBS hasn ' t contacted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else could acquire . " Clearly it must be that they could be approached . It has to remain an open possibility . " Mr. Cottrell declined to say how much UBS was willing to pay for Hill Samuel . He also said a tender offer was unlikely . " We believe ( the bid ) would be much more effective if recommended by the board " of Hill Samuel . " We will get on with it , but we will not be rushed . " A Hill Samuel spokesman said talks between the banks likely would continue through next week . Despite the uncertainty , it looks like the UBS approach " probably will go ahead , " said Norrie Morrison , an analyst at Kleinwort Grieveson &; Co .
