It has , from the beginning , been a story much stranger than fiction ; if a novel had been so riddled with ironies , it would have been condemned for implausibility . In Salman Rushdie and Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini , the world has two master plotters , celebrated controversialists both , with unusually lively imaginations , each of them now in his own embattled hideout while the War of the Words rages on . Yet even Jorge Luis Borges  --  or Rushdie  --  could scarcely have dreamed up a scene in which a Muhammadan cleric vows to kill Salman Rushdie for a book in which the Prophet condemns an apostate called Salman for " polluting the word of God . " Who is the prophet here  --  Rushdie , for predicting the confrontation in the first place , or the Ayatullah , for taking it upon himself to be the living embodiment of Islam ? Life imitates art imitates life . . . <P> Both scriptures and stories have always assured us that people create their own destinies , bring down upon themselves the justice they deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly be described as poetic . Both sides have , in a sense , got exactly what they wanted  --  only to find that perhaps they should not have wanted it after all . In banning the book , various wise bodies have ignored the truth that every parent knows : a prohibition is often an invitation in disguise . And in making his Valentine 's Day call for massacre , Khomeini seems to have gone beyond overkill to hubris : unlike , say , the Christians who opposed The Last Temptation of Christ , he appears unwilling to let God take care of ultimate justice himself . <P> Rushdie , meanwhile , has all the controversy , and attendant celebrity , he has often seemed to crave  --  yet with a cruel vengeance . For years Rushdie has been one of Britain 's most vocal polemicists , an agent provocateur who has delighted in mixing it up  --  even if " it " means politics and literature . His first great novel , Midnight 's Children , about India , was successfully challenged by the Prime Minister of India ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Pakistan ; now the last in his unofficial trilogy , about both India and England , has been banned in India and burned in England . As one who was born into the Islamic faith and studied " the Satanic verses " at Cambridge , he must surely have known that his skeptic 's accounting of Islam was certain to offend ; yet the very title of his book went out of its way to flaunt its hereticism . <P> Thus some of Rushdie 's detractors can now say that a symmetrical justice has been served : those who court fame end up with infamy . The man who notoriously abandoned the longtime editor who backed him for more than a decade in order to get a contract of roughly $1 million has now got a $1 million contract on his head . And in the same breath as he became a household name , Rushdie has become a missing person . Almost worst of all , for a writer , his work of the imagination  --  and an exceptionally complex work of an uncommonly fertile imagination  --  is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; The Satanic Verses has been turned from a book into a talking point . With the drama bringing more and more readers to a novel that most readers will find almost impossible to unravel , one is ironically reminded of the end of that classic discussion of faith vs. doubt , Matthew Arnold 's " Dover Beach , " in which " ignorant armies clash by night .
