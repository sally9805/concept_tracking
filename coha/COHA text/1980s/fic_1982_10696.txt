he was a fraud , you can imagine what the effect was . The Chmielnicki uprising was a physical disaster ; the fats : Messiah was a spiritual disaster . " We are like other people , Reuven . We do not survive disastermerely by appealing to invisible powers . We are as ease ily degraded as any other people . That is what happened to Polish Jewry . By the eighteenth century , it had become a de graded people . Jewish scholarship was dead . In its place cane empty discussions about matters that had no practical con nection with the desperate needs of the masses of Jews . Pilpul , these discussions are called -- empty , nonsensical argument ments over minute points of the Talmud that have no relationat all to the world . Jewish scholars became interested irn showing other Jewish scholars how much they knew , hove many texts they could manipulate . They were not in the least bit interested in teaching the masses of Jews , in communicat ing their knowledge and uplifting the people . And so then  --  : . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . was also a time of terrible superstition . Our people believe : that there were demons and ghosts everywhere that torturee the Jew , wracked his body , and terrorized his soul . These fears affected all Jews . But they affected the unlearned masses worst of all . At least the scholar had his pilpul to keep hire alive . " Now , Reuven , if everywhere around you there are forces that wish to harm you , what is it that you can do to help yourself ? Of course , you try to destroy those forces . But the masses of Jews did not believe they had the power to do this . Only very skillful people possessed such power , they felt .. And so there came upon the scene Jews who claimed to be experts in the chasing away of demons and spirits . Such mesa were looked upon as saints , and they became very popular ir Poland . They claimed that their power came from their ability to manipulate the various letters that spelled out the mysticalnames of God . That is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To drive away evil spirits they wrote magical amulets , prescribed medicines , performed wild dances , wearing the tallit and tefillin over white robes ; they used black candles , sounded the shofar , recited psalms , screamed , pleaded , threatened  --  anything to drive the evil spirits out of a person who , for example , might be ill , orp101away from a mother who was about to have a child . To such a level had our people sunk in Poland by the eighteenth century . And here , Reuven , is where my answer to your questionsabout Reb Saunders ' son really begins . " My father paused for a moment and finished his tea . Then he looked at me and smiled . " Are you tired yet , Reuven ? " " No , abba . " " I am not sounding too much like a schoolteacher ? " " I do n't mind it when you sound like a schoolteacher , " I said . " It is not a lecture , " he said . " I will not ask you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , " I said . He nodded and smiled again . " I will want some more tea , " i he said . " But a little later . Now let me tell you about a man who was born in that century , and I think you will begin to have your answer . " There are many legends about his birth , but I am not interested in telling you legends . He was born about the year 1700 in Poland . His name was Israel . His parents were very poor and not learned , and they both died while he was still a child . The people of his village cared for him and sent him to school . But he did not like school , and whenever he could he would sneak away and escape to the woods where he would walk under the trees , look at the flowers , sit by a brook , listen to the songs of the birds and to the noise of the wind in the leaves . As often as his teachers brought him back , so often did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while they gave up and left him alone . When he was thirteen , he became an assistant to a schoolmaster , but instead of helping the masterteach the little children , he often took them also to the woods where they would sing or stand in silence , listening to the birds in the trees . When he grew older , he became the beadle of the village synagogue . All day long he would sit around , listening to the learned discussions that went on insidethe synagogue walls , and at night , when everyone else slept , he would take the holy books in his hands and study them carefully . But it was not the Talmud that he studied , it was the Kabbalah , the books of Jewish mysticism . The rabbis had forbidden the study of the Kabbalah , and so Israel had to study in secret . He married , finally , but almost nothing isp102known about his wife . She died soon afterward , and Israel , a full-grown man now , became a schoolteacher . He had a wonderfulway with children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a kind and gentle person , honest and unaffected , and often people would come to him and ask him to settle their quarrels . He came to be regarded as a wise and holy man , and one day the father of Rabbi Abraham Gershonof the city of Brody came to him and asked him to settlea business dispute he had with another man . He was so impressed with Israel that he offered to give him his daughter Hannah in marriage . Israel agreed , but asked that the betrothaldocuments be kept a secret for the time being . And now , an interesting event occurred . The father of Hannah died , and Israel traveled to Brody , to the house of the great Rabbi Abraham Gershon , Hannah 's brother , in order to claim his bride . He was dressed in the clothes of a peasant , torn boots and coarse garments , and you can imagine how shocked the rabbi was when he saw the betrothal agreement in Israel 's hands . His sister should marry a peasant ? What shame and dishonor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to persuade his sister to reject her father 's choice , but somehow Hannah saw something in Israel which the good rabbi of Brody did not , and she refused . After their marriage , Rabbi Abraham Gershon tried to improve his brother-in-law 's education . He began by teaching him Talmud , but Israel seemed very uninterested in Talmud . He made him his coachman , but Israel was a failure at that , too . Finally , the rabbi gave up and ordered his sister and brother-in-law to leave Brody so as not to dishonor his good name , and they left . " And now , Reuven , you will begin to have the answer to your question . I am sorry I am taking so long . " " Please go on , abba . " " All right . Israel and his wife left Brody and settled in the Carpathian Mountains in a village near Brody . They were very poor , but very happy . Israel earned a living by selling the lime which they dug in the mountains . The Carpathian Mountains are beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days there alone , praying , dreaming , and singing to the great hills . Very often he would remain alone throughoutthe entire week , and return to his wife Hannah only forp103Shabbat . She must have suffered terribly ' because of their overty , but she believed in him and was very devoted . " Reuven , it was in these mountains that Israel gave birth to Hasidism . He was there many years , thinking , meditating , singing his strange songs , listening to the birds , learning from peasant women how to heal sickness with grasses and herbs , to write amulets , to drive out evil spirits . The people of the village loved him , and soon his reputation as a holy man began to spread throughout all of Poland . Legends began to grow about him . He was not yet forty , and already there were legends about him . You can imagine what kind of person he must have been . " His brother-in-law , Rabbi Abraham Gershon , finally regrettedhis cruelty and asked Israel and Hannah to return to Brody . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Hannah who really managed it while Israel wandered about in the woods and meadows outside of Brody , meditating . Finally , he began to travel , and he became a Ba'al Shem . He was kind and saintly and godly , and he seemed to want to help people not for the money they paid him but for the love he had for them . And so they came to call him the Ba'al Shem Tov  --  the Kind or Good Master of the Name . He mingledwith the people and talked to them about God and His Torah in plain , simple language that they could easily understand . He taught them that the purpose of man is to make his life holy  --  every aspect of his life : eating , drinking , praying , sleeping . God is everywhere , he told them , and if it seems at times that He is hidden from us , it is only because we have not yet learned to seek Him correctly . Evil is like a hard shell . Within this shell is the spark of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? By sincere and honest prayer , by ' being happy , and by loving all people . The Ba'al Shem Teti  --  his followers later shortened his name ar= hLii the Beta d  --  beiieved that no man is so sinful that he can not be moiled by love and understanding . He also believed  --  and here is where he brought down upon himself the rage of the learned rabbis  --  that the study of Talmud was not very important , that there need not be fixed times for prayers , that God could be worshiped through a sincere heart , through joy and singing and dancing . In other words , Reuven , he opposed any form of mechanical religion . There was nothing new inp104what he taught . You will find it all in the Bible , Talmud , and Kabbalah . But he gave it a special emphasis and taught it at a key time to people who were hungry for this kind of teaching . And these people listened and loved him . Many great rabbis came to mock him and went away converted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followers opened their own synagogues . Before the end of that century , about half of eastern European Jewry consisted of Hasidim as his followerswere called , pious ones . So greao . W need of the masses for a new way to approach God . " There was another man born in that century , Rabbi Elijah of Vilna , a great Talmudist , a genius , and a strong opponent of Hasidism . But even his opposition could not stop Hasidism from growing . It flourished and became a great movement in Jewish life . For a long time there was terrible bitterness between the Mitnagdim , the opponents of Hasidism , and the followers of the 13esht . For example , if the son of a Hasid married the daughter of a Mitnaged , both fathers would say Kaddish after their children , considering them to be dead and buried . So great was the bitterness . " The Hasidim had great leaders  --  tzaddikim , they were called , righteous ones . Each Hasidic community had its own tzaddik , and his people would go to him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They followed these leaders blindly . The Hasidim believed that the tzaddik was a superhuman link between themselves and God . Every act of his and every word he spoke was holy . Even the food he touched became holy . For example , they would grab the food scraps he left on his plate and eat them , because the food had become holy through his touch , and they wanted some of this holiness inside themselves . For a while , the tzaddikim were kind and gentle souls , like the Besht himself . But in the next century the movement began to degenerate . Many of the positionsof tzaddik became inherited posts , going automatically from father to son , even if the son was not a great leader . Many tzaddikim lived like Oriental monarchs . Some of them were out-and-out frauds , and they exploited their people terribly . Others were very sincere , and a few were even great scholars of the Talmud . In some Hasidic sects , the study of the Talmud became as important as it had been before the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thep105Hasidim lived shut off from the rest of the world . Anything that was not Jewish and Hasidic was forbidden . Their lives became frozen . The clothes they wear today , for example , are the same Polish-style clothes they wore hundreds of years ago . Their customs and beliefs are also the same as they were hundreds of years ago . But not all of the Hasidic communitiesare identical , Reuven . The Hasidim of Russia , Germany , Poland , and Hungary are different one from the other . Not very different , but they are different . There are even Hasidic groups that believe their leaders should take upon themselves the sufferings of the Jewish people . You are surprised ? But it is true . They believe that their sufferings would be unendurableif their leaders did not somehow absorb these sufferings into themselves . A strange belief , but a very important one , as far as they are concerned . " Reuven , Reb Saunders is a great Talmudist and a great tzaddik . He has a reputation for brilliance and compassion . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind , if not more so . He inherited his position from his father . When he dies , the position will go automatically to Danny . " My father stopped , looked at me with a smile , and said , " You are not asleep yet , Reuven ? " " No , aloha . " " You are a very patient student . I think I am going to have another glass of tea . My throat is a little dry . " I took his glass , poured into it some strong-brewed tea from the teapot , filled it with water from the kettle , then brought it back to him . He put a cube of sugar between his teeth and sipped slowly from the glass , letting the tea soak through the sugar . Then he put the glass down . " Tea is a blessing , " he said , smiling . " Especially to a schoolteacher who must always give long answers to short questions . " I smiled back at him and waited patiently . " All right , " my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ con- ' tinue . Now I am going to tell you another story , also a true story , about a Jewish boy who lived in Poland in the second half of the eighteenth century . As I tell you the story , think of Reb Saunders ' son , and you will have your answer . " This boy , Reuven , was brilliant , literally a genius . His name was Solomon , and later in life he changed his long Pol/ish name to Maimon . When he was young , he found that the Talmud could not satisfy his hunger for knowledge . His mind would not let him rest . He wanted to know what was happening in the outside world . German was by then a great scientificand cultural language , and he decided to teach himself to read German . But even after he learned German he was not satisfied , because the reading of secular books was forbidden . Finally , at the age of twenty-five , he abandoned his wife and child and after many hardships came to Berlin where he joined a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leibniz , Hume , and Kant , and began to write philosophicalbooks . It is astonishing how he was able to gobble up complicated philosophical treatises with such ease . He had a great mind , but it never left him in peace . He wandered from city to city , never finding roots anywhere , never satisfied , and finally died at forty-seven on the estate of a kindheartedChristian who had befriended him . " Reuven , Reb Saunders ' son has a mind like Solomon Maimon 's , perhaps even a greater mind . And Reb Saunders ' soni does not live in Poland . American is free . There are no walls here to hold back the Jews . Is it so strange , then , that he is breaking his father 's rules and reading forbidden books ? He can not help himself . It is unbelievable what he has read these past few months . You are a brilliant student . I tell you that now very proudly . But he is a phenomenon . Once in a generationis a mind like that born . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am goingto tell you . Reb Saunders ' son is a terribly torn and lonely boy . There is literally no one in the world he can talk to . HetPji needs a friend . The accident with the baseball has bound him ! III to you , and he has already sensed in you someone he can talk to without fear . I am very proud of you for that . He would never have told you about his library visits if he believed for a moment you would not keep his words a secret trust . And I want you to let him be your friend and to let yourself be his friend . I am certain you and Reb Saunders ' son can help each other in such a friendship . I know you , and I know him . And I know what I am saying . And now , Reuven , the lecture is over , I am going to finish my tea , and we will go to bed . What a lecture it has been ! Do you want some tea ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father sipped from his glass . " You are very quiet , " he said finally . " It all started with a silly baseball game , " I said . " I ca n't believe it . " " Reuven , as you grow older you will discover that the most important things that will happen to you will often come as a result of silly things , as you call them  --  ' ordinary things ' is a better expression . That is the way the world is . " I shook my head . " I just ca n't believe it , " I said again . " This whole week has been like something from another world . The hospital , the people I met there , Mr. Savo , little Mickey , Billy  --  all because of a ball game . " My father sipped his tea and looked at me over the rim of the glass . He said nothing , but he was watching me intently . " I do n't understand it , " I said . " Weeks and weeks go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same , nothing has changed , and suddenly one day something happens , and everything looks different . " " Different ? What do you mean , different ? " I told him how I had felt that afternoon when I had come home from the hospital . He listened quietly , all the while sip- ' ping his tea . When I finished , I saw him smile . He put down the glass , sighed , and said , " Reuven , it is a tragedy your mother is not alive to  --  " He stopped , his voice breaking . He was quiet for a moment . Then he looked at the clock on the shelf over the refrigerator . " It is very late , " he said . " We will talk some more tomorrow . " " Yes , abba . " " Reuven  --  " " Yes ? " " Never mind . Go to sleep . I am going to sit here for a while and have another glass of tea . " I left him sitting at the kitchen table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met Danny 's father . My father and I woke early so as to be in our synagogue by eight-thirty . Manya came in a little before eight and served us a light breakfast . Then my father and I started out on the three-block walk to the synagogue . It was a beautiful day , and I felt happy to be out on the street again . It was wonderful to be outside that hospital , looking at the people and watching the traffic . When it did n't rain and was n't too cold , my father and I always enjoyed our Shabbat walks to and from the synagogue . There were many synagogues in Williamsburg . Each Hasidicsect had its own house of worship  --  shtibblach , they were called  --  most of them badly lighted , musty rooms , with benches or chairs crowded together and with windows that seemed always to be closed . There were also those synagoguesin which Jews who were not Hasidim worshiped . The synagogue where my father and I prayed had once been a large grocery store . It stood on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window was curtained off , the sun shone in through the uncurtained portion of the glass , and I loved to sit there on a Shabbat morning , with the gold of the sun on the leaves of my prayer book , and pray . The synagogue was attended mostly by men like my father  --  teachers from my yeshiva , and others who had come under the influence of the Jewish Enlightenment in Europe and whose distaste for Hasidism was intense and outspoken . Many of the students in the yeshiva I attended prayed there , too , and it was good to be able to be with them on a Shabbat morning . When my father and I came into the synagogue that morning , the service had just begun . We took our usual seats a 108p109few rows up from the window and joined in the prayers . I saw Davey Cantor come in . He nodded to me , looking gloomy behind his glasses , and took his seat . The prayers went slowly ; the man at the podium had a fine voice and waited until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he began to chant . I glanced at my father during the Silent Devotion . He stood in his long prayer shawl , its silver trim bathed in sunlight , its fringes dangling almost to the floor . His eyes were closed  --  he always prayed from memory , except during a Festival or a High Holiday Service  --  and he was swaying slightly back and forth , his lips murmuring the words . I did not wear a prayer shawl ; they were worn only by adults who were or had once been married . During the Torah Service , which followed the Silent Devotion , I was one of the eight men called up to the podium to recite the blessing over the Torah . Standing at the podium , I listened carefully to the reader as he chanted the words from the scroll . When he was done , I recited the second blessing and the prayer that thanks God when a serious accident has been avoided . As I left the podium and walked back to my seat , I wondered what blessing , if any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What blessing would Mr. Savo make if he were a Jew ? I asked myself . For the rest of the service , I thought constantly of Mr. Savo and Billy . Lunch was ready for us when we got home , and Manya kept adding food to my plate and urging me to eat ; food was necessary for someone who had just come back from the hospital , she told me in her broken English . My father talked about my work at school . I must be careful not to read untilis Dr. Snydman gave me his permission , he said , but there was nothing wrong if I attended classes and listened . Perhaps he could help me study . Perhaps he could read to me . We would try it and see . After the Grace , my father lay down on his bed to rest for a while , and I sat on the porch and stared at the sunlight on the flowers and the ailanthus . I sat like that for about an hour , and then my father came out to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues . I lay back on the lounge chair and stared up at the sky . It was a deep blue , with no clouds , and I felt I could almost touch it . It 's the color of Danny 's eyes , I thought . It 's as bluep110as Danny 's eyes . What color are Billy 's eyes ? I asked myself . I think they 're also blue . Both Danny 's and Billy 's eyes are blue . But one set of eyes is blind . Maybe they 're not blind anymore , I thought . Maybe both sets of eyes are okay now . I fell asleep , thinking about Danny 's and Billy 's eyes . It was a light , dreamless sleep , a kind of half-sleep that re freshes but does not shut off the world completely . I felt the warm wind and smelled newly cut grass , and a bird perched on a branch of the ailanthus and sang for a long time before it flew away . Somehow I knew where that bird was , though I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street , and once a dog barked and a car 's brakes screeched . Someone was playing a piano nearby , and the music drifted slowly in and out of my mind like the ebb and flow of ocean surf . I almost recognized the melody , but I could not be sure ; it slipped like a cool and silken wind from my grasp . I heard a door open and close and there were footsteps against wood , and then silence , and I knew someone had come onto the porch , but I would not open my eyes . I did not want to lose that twilight sleep , with its odors and sounds and whispered flow of music . Someone was on the porch , looking at me . I felt him looking at me . I felt him slowly push away the sleep , and , finally , I opened my eyes , and there was Danny , standing at the foot of the lounge chair , with his arms folded across his chest , clicking his tongue and shaking his head . " You sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel guilty waking you . " I yawned , stretched , and sat up on the edge of the lounge chair . " That was delicious , " I added , yawning again . " What time is it ? " " It 's after five , sleepyhead . I 've been waiting here ten minutesfor you to wake up . " " I slept almost three hours , " I said . " That was some sleep . " He clicked his tongue again and shook his head . " What kind of infield is that ? " He was imitating Mr. Galanter . " How can we keep that infield solid if you 're asleep there , Maher ? " I laughed and got to my feet . " Where do you want to go ? " he asked . " I do n't care . "  | " I thought we 'd go over to my father 's shul . He wants to meet you . " " Where is it ? " I asked him . " It 's five blocks from here . " " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Your maid let me in . Do n't you want to go ? " " Sure , " I said . " Let me wash up and put a tie and jacket It on . I do n't have a caftan , you know . " He grinned at me . " The uniform is a requirement for members of the fold only , " he said . " Okay , member of the fold . Come on inside with me . " I washed , dressed , told Manya that when my father camein she should let him know where I had gone , and we wentout . Is " What does your father want to see me about ? " I asked Danny as we went down the stone stairway of the house . " He wants to meet you . I told him we were friends . " We turned up the street , heading toward Lee Avenue . " He always has to approve of my friends , " Danny said . " Especially if they 're outside the fold . Do you mind my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Because I really think we are , " Danny said . I did n't say anything . We walked to the corner , then turned right on Lee Avenue . The street was busy with traffic and crowded with people . I wondered what any of my classmateswould think if they saw me walking with Danny . It would become quite a topic of conversation in the neighborhood . Well , they would see me with him sooner or later . Danny was looking at me , his sculptured face wearing a seriousexpression . " Do n't you have any brothers or sisters ? " he asked . " No . My mother died soon after I was born . " " I 'm sorry to hear that . " " How about you ? " " I have a brother and a sister . My sister 's fourteen and my brother is eight . I 'm going on sixteen . " " So am I , " I said . We discovered that we had been born in the same year , two days apart.  | " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , and I never knew who you were , " I said . " We stick pretty close together . My father does n't like us to mix with outsiders . " " I hope you do n't mind my saying this , but your father sounds like a tyrant . " Danny did n't disagree . " He 's a very strong-willed person . When he makes up his mind about something , that 's it , fin-ished . " " Does n't he object to your going around with an apikoros like me ? " " That 's why he wants to meet you . " " I thought you said your father never talks to you . " " He does n't . Except when we study Talmud . But he did this time . I got up enough courage to tell him about you , and he said to bring you over today . That 's the longest sentence he 's said to me in years . Except for the time I had to convincehim to let us have a ball team . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It is n't pleasant , " Danny said very quietly . " But he 's a great man . You 'll see when you meet him . " " Is your brother going to be a rabbi , too ? " Danny gave me a queer look . " Why do you ask that ? " " No special reason . Is he ? " " I do n't know . Probably he will . " His voice had a strange , almost wistful quality to it . I decided not to press the point . He went back to talking about his father . " He 's really a great man , my father . He saved his community . He brought them all over to America after the First World War . " " I never heard about that , " I told him . " That 's right , " he said , and told me about his father 's early years in Russia . I listened in growing astonishment .

The firstborn son had been in line to inherit his father 's rabbinic position , but during a period of study in Odessa he suddenly vanished .

The second son was ordained at the age ofp113seventeen , and by the time he was twenty had achieved an awesome reputation as a Talmudist . When his father died , he automatically inherited the position of rabbinic leadership . He was twenty-one years old at the time . He remained the rabbi of his community throughout the years of Russia 's participation in the First World War . One week before the Bolshevist Revolution , in the autumn of 1917 , his young wife bore him a second child , a son .

It was a duplicate of the street on which I lived , but a good deal older and less neatly kept .

The str throbbed with the noise of playing children who seemed constant motion , dodging around cars , racing up and do steps , chasing after cats , climbing trees , balancing themsel as they tried walking on top of the banisters , pursuing c another in furious games of tag  --  all with their fringes a earlocks dancing wildly in the air and trailing out behi them . We were walking quickly now under the dark cell of sycamores , and a tall , heavily built man in a black be ; and black caftan came alongside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and passed me without a wo The liquid streams of racing children , the noisy chatter long-sleeved women , the worn buildings and blotched has ters , the garbage cans and the scrambling cats all gave me feeling of having slid silently across a strange threshold , afor a long moment I regretted having let Danny take me i his world . We were approaching a group of about thirty black-ctaned men who were standing in front of the three-sty brownstone at the end of the street . They formed a sc wall , and I did not want to push through them so I slov my steps , but Danny took my arm with one hand and tam his other hand upon the shoulder of a man on the outer 3 of the crowd . The man turned , pivoting the upper portion his body  --  a middle-aged man , his dark beard streaked vgray , his thick brows edging into a frown of annoyance  --  ; I saw his eyes go wide . He bowed slightly and pushed ba and a whisper went through the crowd like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked through , Danny holding by the arm and nodding his head at the greetings in Yid ( that came in quiet murmurs from the people he passedp116was as if a black-waved , frozen sea had been sliced by a scythe , forming black , solid walls along a jelled path . I saw black- and gray-bearded heads bow toward Danny and dark brows arch sharply over eyes that stared questions at me and at the way Danny was holding me by the arm . We were almosthalfway through the crowd now , walking slowly together , Danny 's fingers on the part of my arm just over the elbow . I felt myself naked and fragile , an intruder , and my eyes , searching for anything but the bearded faces to look at , settled , finally , upon the sidewalk at my feet . Then , because I wanted something other than the murmured greetings in Yiddishto listen to , I began to hear , distinctly , the tapping sounds of Danny 's metal-capped shoes against the cement pavement . It seemed a sharp , unnaturally loud sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hear it clearly as we went along . I listened to it intently  --  the soft scrape of the shoe and the sharp tap-tap of the metal caps  --  as we went up the stone steps of the stairway that led into the brownstone in front of which the crowd stood . The caps tapped against the stone of the steps , then against the stone of the top landing in front of the double door  --  and I remembered the old man I often saw walking along Lee Avenue , moving carefully through the busy street and tapping , tapping , his metal-capped cane , which served him for the eyes he had lost in a First World War trench during a German gas attack . The hallway of the brownstone was crowded with blackcaftanedmen , and there was suddenly a path there , too , and more murmured greetings and questioning eyes , and then Danny and I went through a door that stood open to our right , and we were in the synagogue . It was a large room and looked to be the exact size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What was my father'sbedroom was here the section of the synagogue that contained the Ark , the Eternal Light , an eight-branched candelabrum , a small podium to the right of the Ark , and a large podium about ten feet in front of the Ark . The two podiumsand the Ark were covered with red velvet . What was our kitchen , hallway , bathroom , my bedroom , my father 's study and our front room , was here the portion of the synagoguewhere the worshipers sat . Each seat consisted of a chair set before a stand with a sloping top , the bottom edgep117of which was braced with a jutting strip of wood to prevent what was on the stand from sliding to the floor . The seats extendedback to about twenty feet from the rear wall of the synagogue , the wall opposite the Ark . A small portion of the synagogue near the upper door of the hallway had been curtainedoff with white cheesecloth . This was the women 's section . It contained a few rows of wooden chairs . The remainingsection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with long tables and benches . Through the middle of the synagogue ran a narrow aisle that ended at the large podium . The walls were painted white . The wooden floor was a dark brown . The three rear windows were curtained in black velvet . The ceiling was white , and naked bulbs hung from it on dark wires , flooding the room with harsh light . We stood for a moment just inside the door near one of the tables . Men passed constantly in and out of the room . Some remained in the hallway to chat , others took seats . Some of the seats were occupied by men studying Talmud , reading from the Book of Psalms , or talking among themselves in Yiddish . The benches at the tables stood empty , and on the white cloths that covered the tables were paper cups , wooden forks and spoons , and paper plates filled with pickled herring and onion , lettuce , tomatoes , gefiilte fish , Shabbat loaves  --  the braided bread called chalah  --  tuna fish , salmon , and hard-boiled eggs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown leather chair . On the table in front of the chair was a pitcher , a towel , a saucer , and a large plate covered with a Shabbat cloth  --  a white satin cloth , with the Hebrewword for the Shabbat embroidered upon it in gold . A long serrated silver knife lay alongside the plate . A tall , heavyset boy came in the door , nodded at Danny , then noticed me , and stared . I recognized him immediately as Dov Shlomowitz , the player on Danny 's team who had run into me at second base and knocked me down . He seemed about to say something to Danny , then changed his mind , turned stiffly , went up the narrow aisle , and found a seat . Sittingin the seat , he glanced at us once over his shoulder , then opened a book on his stand , and began to sway back and forth . I looked at Danny and managed what must have been a sick smile . " I feel like a cowboy surrounded by Indians , " I told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go of my arm . " You 're in the holy halls , " he said . " It takes getting used to . " " That was like the parting of the Red Sea out there , " I said . " How did you do it ? " " I 'm my father 's son , remember ? I 'm the inheritor of the dynasty . Number one on our catechism : Treat the son as you would the father , because one day the son will be the father . " " You sound like a Mitnaged , " I told him , managing anotherweak smile . " No , I do n't , " he said . " I sound like someone who reads too much . Come on . We sit up front . My father will be down soon . " " You live in this house ? " " We have the upper two floors . It 's a fine arrangement . Come on . They 're beginning to come in . " The crowd in the hallway and in front of the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went up the aisle . He led me to the front row of seats that stood at the right of the large podium and just behind the small podium . Danny sat down in the second seat and I sat in the third . I assumed that the first seat was for his father . The crowd came in quickly , and the synagogue was soon filled with the sounds of shuffling shoes , scraping chairs , and loud voices talking Yiddish . I heard no English , only Yiddish . Sitting in the chair , I glanced over at Dov Shlomowitz , and found him staring at me , his heavy face wearing an expression of surprise and hostility , and I suddenly realized that Danny was probably going to have as much trouble with his friends over our friendship as I would have with mine . Maybe less , I thought . I 'm not the son of a tzaddik . No one steps aside for me in a crowd . Dov Shlomowitz looked away but I saw others in the crowded synagogue staring at me too , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeling exposed and naked again , and very alone . Two gray-bearded old men came over to Danny , and he got respectfully to his feet . They had had an argument over a passage of Talmud , they told him , each of them interpreting it in a different way , and they wondered who had been correct . They mentioned the passage , and Danny nodded , immediately identified the tractate and the page , then coldly and mechanically repeated the passage word for word , givingp119his interpretation of it , and quoting at the same time the interpretationsof a number of medieval commentators like the Me'iri , the Rashba , and the Maharsha . The passage was a difficultone , he said , gesticulating with his hands as he spoke , the thumb of his right hand describing wide circles as he emphasizedcertain key points of interpretation , and both men had been correct ; one had unknowingly adopted the interpretation of the Me'iri , the other of the Rashba . The men smiled and went away satisfied . Danny sat down . " That 's a tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make head or tail out of it . Your father would probably say the text was all wrong . " He was talking quietly and grinning broadly . " I read some of your father 's articles . Sneaked them off my father 's desk . The one on that passage in Kiddushin about the business with the king is very good . It 's full of real apikorsische stuff . " I nodded , and tried another smile . My father had read that article to me before he had sent it off to his publisher . He had begun reading his articles to me during the past year , and spent a lot of time explaining them . The noise in the synagogue had become very loud , almost a din , and the room seemed to throb and swell with the scraping chairs and the talking men . Some children were runningup and down the aisle , laughing and shouting , and a number of younger men lounged near the door , talking loudly and gesticulating with their hands . I had the feeling for a moment I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with its pushing , shoving , noisy throng , and its shouting , arm-waving vendors and pitchmen . I sat quietly , staring down at the prayer book on my stand . I opened the book and turned to the Afternoon Service . Its pages were yellow and old , with ragged edges and worn corners . I sat there , staring at the first psalm of the service and thinking of the almost new prayer book I had held in my hands that morning . I felt Danny nudge me with his elbow , and I looked up . " My father 's coming , " he said . His voice was quiet and , I thought , a little strained . The noise inside the synagogue ceased so abruptly that I felt its absence as one would a sudden lack of air . It stopped in swift waves , beginning at the rear of the synagogue andp120ending at the chairs near the podium . I heard no signal and no call for silence ; it simply stopped , cut off , as if a door had slammed shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed had a strange quality to it : expectation , eagerness , love , awe . A man was coming slowly up the narrow aisle , followed by a child . He was a tall man , and he wore a black satin caftan and a fur-trimmed black hat : As he passed each row of seats , men rose , bowed slightly , and sat again . Some leaned over to touch him . He nodded his head at the murmur of greetings directed to him from the seats , and his long black beard moved back and forth against his chest , and his earlocks swayed . He walked slowly , his hands clasped behind his back , and as he came closer to me I could see that the part of his face not hidden by the beard looked cut from stone , the nose sharp and pointed , the cheekbones ridged , the lips full , the brow like marble etched with lines , the sockets deep , the eyebrowsthick with black hair and separated by a single wedge like a furrow plowed into a naked field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing in them as they do in black stones in the sun . Danny 's face mirrored his exactly  --  except for the hair and the color of the eyes . The child who followed him , holding on to the caftan with his right hand , was a delicate miniature of the man , with the same caftan , the same fur-trimmed hat , the same face , the same color hair , though beardless , and I realized he was Danny 's brother . I glanced at Danny and saw him staring down at his stand , his face without ' expression . I saw the eyes of the congregants follow the man as he came slowly up the aisle , his hands clasped behind his back , his head nodding , and then I saw them on Danny and me as he came up to us . Danny rose quickly to his feet , and I followed , and we stood there , waiting , as the man 's dark eyes moved across my face -- I could feel them moving across my face like a hand  --  and fixed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father 's gentle eyes behind their steel-rimmed spectacles , but it vanished swiftly , because Danny was introducing me to Reb Saunders . " This is Reuven Maher , " he said quietly in Yiddish . Reb Saunders continued to stare at my left eye . I felt naked under his gaze , and he must have sensed my discomfort , because quite suddenly he offered me his hand . I raisedp121my hand to take it , then realized , as my hand was going up , that he was not offering me his hand but his fingers , and I held them for a moment  --  they were dry and limp  --  then let my hand drop . " You are the son of David Malter ? " Reb Saunders asked me in Yiddish . His voice was deep and nasal , like Danny 's , and the words came out almost like an accusation . I nodded my head . I had a moment of panic , trying to decidewhether to answer him in Yiddish or English . I wondered if he knew English . My Yiddish was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , " Reb Saunders said in Yiddish . " It is healed ? " " It 's fine , " I said in English . My voice came out a little hoarse , and I swallowed . I glanced at the congregants . They were staring at us intently , in complete silence . Reb Saunders looked at me for a moment , and I saw the dark eyes blink , the lids going up and down like shades . When he spoke again it was still in Yiddish . " The doctor , the professor who operated , he said your eye is healed ? " " He wants to see me again in a few days . But he said the eye is fine . " I saw his head nod slightly and the beard go up and down against his chest . The lights from the naked bulb on the ceilinggleamed off his satin caftan . " Tell me , you know mathematics ? My son tells me you are very good in mathematics . " I nodded . " So . We will see . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows Hebrew . " I nodded again . " We will see , " Reb Saunders said . I glanced out of the sides of my eyes and saw Danny looking down at the floor , his face expressionless . The child stood a little behind Reb Saunders and stared up at us , his mouth open . " Nu , " Reb Saunders said , " later we will talk more . I want to know my son 's friend . Especially the son of David Malter . " Then he went past us and stood in front of the little podium , his back to the congregation , the little boy still holding on to his caftan.  |p122Danny  and I sat down . A whisper moved through the congregation , followed by the rustle of pages as prayer books were opened . An old , gray-bearded man went up to the large podium , put on a prayer shawl , and started the service . The old man had a weak voice , and I could barely hear him over the prayers of the worshipers . Reb Saunders stood with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , occasionally clapping his hands together , and the child stood at his right , swaying too , in obvious imitation of his father . Throughout the entire service , Reb Saunders stood with his back to the congregation , sometimes raising his head toward the ceiling , or raising his hands to cover his eyes . He turned only when the Torah was taken from the Ark and read . The service ended with the Kaddish , and then Reb Saunderswalked slowly back up the aisle , followed by the child , who was still clinging to his father 's caftan . As the child passed me , I noticed his dark eyes were very large and his face was deathly pale . Danny nudged me with his elbow and motioned with his head toward the rear of the synagogue . He rose , and the two of us followed Reb Saunders up the aisle . I could see the eyes of the congregants on my face , and then feel them on my back . I saw Reb Saunders go to the leather chair at the table near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bench to his left . Danny led me to the table and sat on the bench to his father 's right . He motioned me to sit down next to him , and I did . The congregants rose and came toward the rear of the synagogue . The silence was gone now , burst as abruptly as it had begun , and someone started chanting a tune , and others took it up , clapping their hands in rhythm to the melody . They were filing out the door  --  probably to wash their hands , I thought  --  and soon they were coming back in and finding seats at the tables , the benches scraping loudly as they were moved back and forth . The singing had stopped . Our table filled rapidly , mostly with older men . Reb Saunders stood up , poured water over his hands frog the pitcher , the water spilling into the saucer , then wiped his hands , removed the white satin . cloth that covered the chalah , said the blessing over bread , cut a section off the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Danny got to his feet.  |p123washed  his hands , cut two slices from the chalah , handed me one , took one for himself , made the blessing , ate , and sat . He passed the pitcher to me , and I repeated the ritual , but I remainedseated . Then Danny cut the remainder of the chalah into small pieces , gave a piece to his brother , and handed the plate to the old man sitting next to me . The pieces of chalah disappeared swiftly , grabbed up by the men at the table . Reb Saunders put some salad and fish on his plate and ate a small piece of the fish , holding it in his fingers . A man from one of the other tables came over and took the plate . Danny filled another plate for his father . Reb Saunders ate slowly , and in silence . I was not very hungry , but I made some attempt at eating so as not to insult anyone . Frequently during the meal , I felt rather than saw Reb Saunders ' eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother pecked at the food on his plate , eatinglittle . The skin of his face and hands was almost as white as the tablecloth , drawn tightly over the bones , and the veins showed like blue branches in his face and on the tops of his hands . He sat quietly , and once he began to pick his nose , saw his father look at him , and stopped , his lower lip tremblinga little . He bent over his plate and poked at a slice of tomato with a thin , stubby finger . Danny and I said nothing to each other throughout that entire meal . Once I looked up and saw his father staring at me , his eyes black beneath the thick brows . I looked away , feeling as though my skin had been peeled away and my insidesphotographed . Someone began to sing Atah Echad , one of the prayers from the Afternoon Service . The meal was over , and the men began to sway slowly , in unison with the melody . The singing filled the synagogue , and Reb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then Danny was singing . I knew the melody and I joined in , hesitantly at first , then strongly , swaying back and forth . At the end of the song , another melodywas begun , a light , fast , wordless tune , sung to the syllablescheeree him , cheeree ham , and the swaying was a little faster now , and hands were clapped in time to the rhythm . Then tune followed tune , and I felt myself begin to relax as I continued to join the singing . I found that most of the melodieswere familiar to me , especially the slow , somber onesp124that were meant to convey the sadness of the singers over the conclusion of the Shabbat , and the tunes I did not know I was able to follow easily , because the basic melody lines were almost all the same . After a while I was singing loudly , swaying back and forth and clapping my hands , and once I saw Reb Saunders looking at me , and his lips curved into a shadow of a smile . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we sat there for about half an hour , singing , swaying , and clapping , and I felt light and happy and completely at ease . So far as I could see , Reb Saunders ' little son was the only one in the synagogue not singing ; he sat pecking at his food and poking at the slice of tomato on his paper plate with his thin , veined hand . The singing went on and on  --  and then it stopped . I glanced around to see what had happened , but everyone was sitting very still , looking over at our table . Reb Saunders washed his hands again , and others spilled what was left of the water in their paper cups over their hands . The introductory psalm to the Grace was sung together , and then Reb Saunders began the Grace . He chanted with his eyes closed , swaying slightly in his leather chair . After the opening lines of the Grace , each man prayed quietly , and I saw Danny lean forward , put his elbows on the table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispering the words . Then the Grace was done , and there was silence  --  a long , solid silence in which no one moved and everyone waited and eyes stared at Reb Saunders , who was sitting in his chair with his eyes closed , swaying slightly back and forth . I saw Danny take his elbows from the table and sit up straight . He stared down at his paper plate , his face expressionless , and I almost had the feeling that he had gone rigid , tense , as a soldier does before he jumps from shelter into open combat . Everyone waited , and no one moved , no one coughed , no one even took a deep breath . The silence became unreal and seemed suddenly filled with a noise of its own , the noise of a too long silence . Even the child was staring now at his father ; his eyes like black stones against the naked whiteness of his veined face . And then Reb Saunders began to speak . He swayed back and forth in the leather chair , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his right elbow , the fin/gcrs of his right hand stroking his black beard , and I could see everyone at the tables lean forward , eyes staring , mouths slightly open , some of the older men cupping their hands behind their ears to catch his words . He began in a low voice , the words coming out slowly in a singsong kind of chant . " The great and holy Rabban Gamaliel , " he said , " taught us the following : ' Do His will as if it were thy will , that He may do thy will as if it were His will . Nullify thy will before His will that He may nullify the will of others before thy will . ' What does this mean ? It means that if we do as the Master of the Universe wishes , then He will do as we wish . A question immediately presents itself . What does it mean to say that the Master of the Universe will do what we wish ? He is after all the Master of the Universe , the Creator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what are we ? Do we not say every day , Are not all the mighty as naught before Thee , the men of renown as though they had not been , the wise as if withoutknowledge , and the men of understanding as if without discernment ' ? What are we that the Master of the Universe should do our will ? " Reb Saunders paused , and I saw two of the old men who were sitting at our table look at each other and nod . He swayed back and forth in his leather chair , his fingers strokinghis beard , and continued to speak in a quiet , singsong voice . " All men come into the world in the same way . We are born in pain , for it is written , ' In pain shall ye bring forth children . ' We are born naked and without strength . Like dust are we born . Like dust can the child be blown about , like dust is his life , like dust is his strength . And like dust do many remain all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a place of worms and maggots . Will the Master of the Universe obey the will of a man whose life is dust ? What is the great and holy Rabban Gamaliel teaching us ? " His voice was beginning to rise now . " What is he telling us ? What does it mean to say the Master of the Universe will do our will ? The will of men who remain dust ? Impossible ! The will of what men , then ? We must say , the will of men who do not remain dust . But how can we raise ourselves above dust ? Listen , listen to me , for this is a mighty thing the rabbis teach us. "  |p126He  paused again , and I saw Danny glance at him , then stare down again at his paper plate . " Rabbi Halafta son of Dosa teaches us , When ten people sit together and occupy themselves with the Torah , the Presenceof God abides among them , as it is said , " God standeth in the congregation of the godly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to five ? Because it is said , " He had founded his band upon the earth . " And whence can it be shown that the same applies to three ? Because it is said , " He judgeth among the judges . " And whence can it be shown that the same applies to two ? Because it is said , " Then they that feared the Lord spake one with the other , and the Lord gave heed and heard . " And whence can it be shown that the same applies even to one ? Because it is said , " In every place where I cause my name to be remembered I will come into thee and I will bless thee . " ' Listen , listen to this great teaching . A congregation is ten . It is nothing new that the holy Presence resides among ten . A band is five . It is also nothing new that the holy Presence resides among five . Judges are three . If the holy Presence did not reside among judges there would be no justice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new . That the Presencecan reside even among two is also not impossible to understand . But that the Presence can reside in one ! In one ! Even in one ! That already is a mighty thing . Even in one ! If one man studies Torah , the Presence is with him . If one man studies Torah , the Master of the Universe is already in the world . A mighty thing ! And to bring the Master of the World into the world is also to raise oneself up from the dust . Torah raises us from the dust ! Torah gives us strength ! Torah clothes us ! Torah brings the Presence ! " The singsong chant had died away . He was talking in a straight , loud voice that rang through the terrible silence in the synagogue . " But to study Torah is not such a simple thing . Torah is a task for all day and all night . It is a task filled with danger . Does not Rabbi Meir teach us , He who is walking by the way and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How fine is that tree , how fine is that field , " him the Scripture regardsas if he had forfeited his life ' ? " I saw Danny glance quickly at his father , then lower hisp127eyes . His body sagged a little , a smile played on his lips , and I thought I even heard him sigh quietly . " He had forfeited his life ! His life ! So great is the study of Torah . And now , listen , listen to this word . Whose task is it to study Torah ? Of whom does the Master of the Universe demand Ye shall meditate over it day and night ' ? Of the world ? No ! What does the world know of Torah ? The world is Esav ! The world is Amalek ! The world is Cossacks ! The world is Hitler , may his name and memory be erased ! Of whom , then ? Of the people of Israel ! We are commanded to study His Torah ! We are commanded to sit in the light of the Presence ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the great and holy Rabbi Yochanan son of Zakkai teach us , ' If thou Nast learnt much Torah , ascribe not any merit to thyself , for thereunto wast thou created ' ? Not the world , but the people of Israel ! The people of Israel must study His Torah ! " His voice stormed the silence . I found myself holding my breath , my heart thumping in my ears . I could not take my eyes off his face , which was alive now , or his eyes , which were open and filled with dark fire . He struck the table with his hand , and I felt myself go cold with fright . Danny was watching him now , too , and his little brother stared at him as though in a trance , his mouth open , his eyes glazed . " The world kills us ! The world flays our skin from our bodies and throws us to the flames ! The world laughs at Torah ! And if it does not kill us , it tempts us ! It misleads us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its ugliness , its impurities , it abominations ! The world is Amalek ! It is not the world that is commanded to study Torah , but the people of Israel ! Listen , listen to this mighty teaching . " His voice was suddenly lower , quieter , intimate . " It is written , This world is like a vestibule before the world-to-come ; prepare thyself in the vestibule , that thou mayest enter into the hall . ' The meaningis clear : The vestibule is this world , and the hall is the world-to-come . Listen . In gematriya , the words this world ' come out one hundred sixty-three , and the words the worldto-come ' come out one hundred fifty-four . The difference betweenthis world ' and the world-to-come ' comes out to nine . Nine is half of eighteen . Eighteen is chai , life . In this world there is only half of chai . We are only half alive in this world ! Only half alive ! "  |p128A  whisper went through the crowd at the tables , and I could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this apparently , the gematriya , and they strained forward to listen . One of my teachers in school had told me about gematriya . Each letter of the Hebrew alphabet is also a number , so that every Hebrew word has a numerical value . The word for " this world " in Hebrew is " olam hazeh , " and by adding the numerical value of each letter , the total numerical value of the word becomes one hundred and sixty-three . I had heard others do this before , and I enjoyed listening because sometimes they were quite clever and ingenious . I was beginning to feel relaxed again , and I listened carefully . " Hear me now . Listen . How can we make our lives full ? How can we fill our lives so that we are eighteen , chai , and not nine , not half chai ? Rabbi Joshua son of Levi teaches us , Whoever does not labor in the Torah is said to be under the divine censure . ' He is a nozuf , a person whom the Master of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , studies Torah , for it is written , For his delight is in the Torah of God , and over His Torah doth he meditate day and night . ' In gematriya , nozuf comes out one hundred forty-three , and ' tzaddik ' comes out two hundred and four . What is the differencebetween ' nozuf and ' tzaddik ' ? Sixty-one . To whom does a tzaddik dedicate his life ? To the Master of the Universe ! La-el , to God ! The word , ' La-el ' in gematriya is sixty-one ! It is a life dedicated to God that makes the difference between the nozuf and the tzaddik ! " Another murmur of approval went through the crowd . Reb Saunders was very good at gematriya , I thought . I was really enjoying myself now . " And now listen to me further . In gematriya , the letters of the word ' traklin , ' hall , the hall that refers to the world-tocome , come out three hundred ninety-nine , and ' prozdor , ' the vestibule , the vestibule that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' traklin ' from ' prozdor , ' and we have one hundred fourteen . Now listen to me . A righteous man , we said , is two hundred four . A righteous man lives by Torah . Torah is mayim , water ; the great and holy rabbis alwayscompare Torah to water . The word ' mayim ' in gematriyais ninety . Take ' mayim ' from ' tzaddik ' and we also have one hundred fourteen . From this we learn that the righteousp129man who removes himself from Torah also removes himself from the world-to-come ! " The whisper of delight was loud this time , and men noddedtheir heads and smiled . Some of them were even poking each other with their elbows to indicate their pleasure . That one had really been clever . I started to go over it again in my mind . " We see that without Torah there is only half a life . We see that without Torah we are dust . We see that without Torah we are abominations . " He was saying this quietly , almost as if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was looking directly at Danny now . " When we study Torah , then the Master of the Universe listens . Then He hears our words . Then He will fulfill our wishes . For the Master of the Universe promises strength to those who preoccupy themselves in Torah , as it is written , So ye may be strong , ' and He promises length of days , as it is written . So that your days may be lengthened . ' May Torah be a fountain of waters to all who drink from it , and may it bring to us the Messiah speedilyand in our day . Amen ! " A chorus of loud and scattered amens answered . I sat in my seat and saw Reb Saunders looking at Danny , then at me . I felt completely at ease , and I somewhat brazenlysmiled and nodded , as if to indicate that I had enjoyed his words , or at least the gematriya part of his words . I did n't agree at all with his notions of the world as being contaminated . Albert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . President Roosevelt is part of the world . The millions of soldiersfighting Hitler are part of the world . I thought that the meal was ended now and we would start the Evening Service , and I almost began to get out of my seat when I realized that another silence had settled upon the men at the tables . I sat still and looked around . They seemed all to be staring at Danny . He was sitting quietly , smiling a little , his fingers playing with the edge of his paper plate . Reb Saunders sat back in his leather chair and folded his arms across his chest . The little boy was poking at the tomato again and glancing at Danny from the tops of his dark eyes . He twirled a side curl around one of his fingers , and I saw his tongue dart out of his mouth , run over his lips , then dart back in . I wondered what was going on.  |p130Reb  Saunders sighed loudly and nodded at Danny , " Nu , Daniel , you have something to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Danny nod his head . " Nu , what is it ? " " It is written in the name of Rabbi Yaakov , not Rabbi Meir , " Danny said quietly , in Yiddish . A whisper of approval came from the crowd . I glancedaround quickly . Everyone sat staring at Danny . Reb Saunders almost smiled . He nodded , and the long black beard went back and forth against his chest . Then I saw the thick black eyebrows arch upward and the lids go about halfway down across the eyes . He leaned forward slightly , his arms still folded across his chest . " And nothing more ? " he asked very quietly . Danny shook his head  --  a little hesitantly , I thought . " So , " Reb Saunders said , sitting back in the leather chair , " there is nothing more . " I looked at the two of them , wondering what was happening . What was this about Rabbi Yaakov and Rabbi Meir ? " The words were said by Rabbi Yaakov , not by Rabbi Meir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rabbi Meir , said , He who is walking by the way and studying , and breaks off his study and  --  " " Good , " Reb Saunders broke in quietly . " The words weresaid by Rav Yaakov . Good . You saw it . Very good . And where is it found ? " " In Pirkei Avos , " Danny said . He was giving the Talmudic source for the quote . Many of the quotes Reb Saunders had used had been from Pirkei Avos  --  or divot , as my father had taught me to pronounce it , with the Sephardic rather than the Ashkenazic rendering of the Hebrew letter " tof . " I had recognized the quotes easily . Pirkei Avot is a collection of Rabbinicmaxims , and a chapter of it is studied by many Jewsevery Shabbat between Passover and the Jewish New Year . " Nu , " Reb Saunders said , smiling , " how should you not know that ? Of course . Good . Very good . Now , tell me  --  " III As I sat there listening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I slowly realized what I was witnessing . In many Jewish homes , especially homes where there are yeshiva students and where the father is learned , there is ap131tradition which takes place on Shabbat afternoon : The father quizzes the son on what he has learned in school during the past week . I was witnessing a kind of public quiz , but a ' strange , almost bizarre quiz , more a contest than a quiz , becauseReb Saunders was not confining his questions only to what Danny had learned during the week but was ranging over most of the major traotates of the Talmud and Danny was obviously required to provide the answers . Reb Saunders asked where else there was a statement about one who interruptshis studies , and Danny coolly , quietly answered . He asked what a certain medieval commentator had remarked ' about that statement , and Danny answered . He chose a minuteaspect of the answer and asked who had dealt with it in an altogether different way , and Danny answered . He asked whether Danny agreed with this interpretation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medieval commentator , who had given another interpretation . His father asked how could the commentator have offered such an interpretationwhen in another passage in the Talmud he had said exactlythe opposite , and Danny , very quietly , calmly , his fingersstill playing with the rim of the paper plate , found a difference between the contradictory statements by quoting two other sources where one of the statements appeared in a somewhat different context , thereby nullifying the contradiction . One of the two sources Danny had quoted contained a biblical verse , and his father asked him who else had based a law upon this verse . Danny repeated a short passage from the tractate Sanhedrin , and then his father quoted another passagefrom Yoma which contradicted the passage in Sanhedrin , and Danny answered with a passage from Gittin which dissolved the contradiction . His father questioned the validity of his interpretation of the passage in Gittin by citing a commentary on the passage that disagreed with his interpretation , and Danny said it was difficult to understand this commentary  --  hedid not say the commentary was wrong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a parallel passage in Nedarimclearly confirmed his own interpretation . This went on and on , until I lost track of the thread that held it all together and sat and listened in amazement to the feat of memory I was witnessing . Both Danny and his father spoke quietly , his father nodding his approval each timep132Danny responded . Danny 's brother sat staring at them with mouth open , finally lost interest , and began to eat some the food that was still on his plate . Once he started picking hit nose , but stopped immediately . The men around the tables were watching as if in ecstasy , their faces glowing with pride . This was almost like the pilpul my father had told me about , except that it was n't really pilpul , they were n't twisting the texts out of shape , they seemed more interested in b'kiut , in straightforward knowledge and simple explanations of the Talmudic passages and commentaries they were discussing . It went on like that for a long time . Then Reb Saunders sat back and was silent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Reb Saunderswas smiling at his son . He said , very quietly , " Good . Very good . There is no contradiction . But tell me , you have nothing more to say about what I said earlier ? " Danny was suddenly sitting very straight . " Nothing more ? " Reb Saunders ( asked again . " You have nothing more to say ? " Danny shook his head , hesitantly . " Absolutely nothing more to say ? " Reb Saunders insisted , his voice flat , cold , distant . He was no longer smiling . I saw Danny 's body go rigid again , as it had done before his father began to speak . The ease and certainty he had worn during the Talmud quiz had disappeared . " So , " Reb Saunders said . " There is nothing more . Nu , what should I say ? " " I did not hear  --  " " You did not hear , you did not hear . You heard the first mistake , and you stopped listening . Of course you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not listening ? " He said it quietly and without anger . Danny 's face was rigid . The crowd sat silent . I looked at Danny . For a long moment he sat very still  --  and then I saw his lips part , move , curve slowly upward , and freeze into a grin . I felt the skin on the back of my neck begin to crawl , and I almost cried out . I stared at him , then looked quickly away . Reb Saunders sat looking at his son . Then he turned his eyes upon me . I felt his eyes looking at me . There was a long , dark silence , during which Danny sat very still , staring  --   |p133fixedly  at his plate and grinning . Reb Saunders began to play with the earlock along the right side of his face . He caressed it with the fingers of his right hand , wound it around the index finger , released it , then caressed it again , all the time looking at me . Finally , he sighed loudly , shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nu , " he said , " it is possible I am not right . After all , my son is not a mathematician . He has a good head on him , but it is not a head for mathematics . But we have a mathematicianwith us . The son of David Matter is with us . He is a mathematician . " He was looking straight at me , and I felt my heart pound and the blood drain from my face . " Reuven , " Reb Saunders was saying , looking straight at me , " you have nothing to say ? " I found I could n't open my mouth . Say about what ? I had n't the faintest idea what he and Danny had been talking about . " You heard my little talk ? " Reb Saunders asked me quietly . I felt my head nod . " And you have nothing to say ? " I felt his eyes on me and found myself staring down at the table . The eyes were like flames on my face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked softly . I looked up and nodded . Danny had n't moved at all . He just sat there , grinning . His little brother was playing with the tomato again . And the men at the tables were silent , staring at me now . " I am very happy , " Reb Saunders said gently . " You liked the gematriya . Which gematriya did you like ? " I heard myself say , lamely and hoarsely , " They were all very good . " Reb Saunders ' eyebrows went up . " All ? " he said . " A very nice thing . They were all very good . Reuven , were they all very good ? " I felt Danny stir and saw him turn his head , the grin gone now from his lips . He glanced at me quickly , then looked down again at his paper plate . I looked at Reb Saunders . " No , " I heard myself say hoarsely . " They were not all good . "  |p134There  was a stir from the men at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Nu , Reuven , " he said quietly , " tell me , which one was not good ? " " One of the gematriyot was wrong , " I said . I thought the world would fall in on me after I said that . I was a fifteenyear-oldboy , and there I was , telling Reb Saunders he had been wrong ! But nothing happened . There was another stir from the crowd , but nothing happened . Instead , Reb Saundersbroke into a warm , broad smile . " And which one was it ? " he asked me quietly . " The gematriya for ' prozdor ' is five hundred and three , not five hundred and thirteen , " I answered . " Good . Very good , " Reb Saunders said , smiling and noddinghis head , the black beard going back and forth against his chest , the earlocks swaying . " Very good , Reuven . The gematriyafor iprozdor ' comes out five hundred three . Very good . " He looked at me , smiling broadly , his teeth showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw his eyes mist over . There was a loud murmur from the crowd , and Danny 's body sagged as the tension went out of him . He glanced at me , his face a mixture of surprise and relief , and I realized with astonishment that I , too , had just passed some kind of test . " Nu , " Reb Saunders said loudly to the men around the tables , " say Kaddish ! " An old man stood up and recited the Scholar 's Kaddish . Then the congregants broke to go back to the front section of the synagogue for the Evening Service . Danny and I said nothing to each other throughout the service , and though I prayed the words , I did not know what I was saying . I kept going over what had happened at the table . I could n't believe it . I just could n't get it through my head that Danny had to go through something like that every week , and that I myself had gone through it tonight . The followers of Reb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could see they were no longer staring questions at me but were glancing at me admiringly . One of them , an old man with a white beard who was sitting in my row , even nodded at me and smiled , thep135corners of his eyes crinkling . I had clearly passed the test . What a ridiculous way to gain admiration and friendship ! The Evening Service was over very quickly , and afterward one of the younger men chanted the Havdalah , the brief servicethat marks the end of the Shabbat . Danny 's brother held the braided candle , his hand trembling a little as the molten wax spilled onto his fingers . Then the congregants wished one another and Reb Saunders a good week and began to leave the synagogue . It was late , and I thought my father would probably be worried about me by now , but I stood there and waited until the last congregant was gone and the synagogue was empty -- except for me , Danny , Reb Saunders , and the little boy . The synagogue seemed to me suddenly very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reb Saunders was stroking his beard and looking at Danny and me . He leaned an elbow upon the large podium , and then the hand that was stroking the beard began to play with an earlock . I heard him sigh and saw him shake his head slowly , his dark eyes moist and brooding . " Reuven , you have a good head on you , " he said quietly in Yiddish . " I am happy my Daniel has chosen you for a friend . My son has many friends . But he does not talk about them the way he talks about you . " I listened and said nothing . His voice was gentle , almost a caress . He seemed so altogether different now from the way he had been at the table . I glanced at Danny . He was looking at his father , and the rigid lines were gone from his face . Reb Saunders clasped his hands behind his back . " I know of your father , " he said to me quietly . " I am not surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great scholar . But what he writes , ah , what he writes ! " He shook his head . " I worry myself about my son 's friends , especially if such a friend is the son of David Malter . Ah , what your fatherwrites ! Criticism . Scientific criticism . Ah ! So when he tells me you are now his friend , I worry myself . The son of David Malter should be my Daniel 's friend ? But your father is an observer of the Commandments , and you have his head , and so I am happy you are friends . It is good my Daniel has a friend . I have many responsibilities , I am not always able to talk to him . " I saw Danny stare down at the floor , his facep136hardening . " It is good he has acquired a friend . Just so his friend does not teach him scientific criticism . " Reb Saunders looked at me , his eyes dark and brooding . " You think a friend is an easy thing to be ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We will see . Nu , it is late and your father is certainly worried that you are away so long . Have a good week , Reuven . And come pray with us again . There will be no more mistakes in gematriya . " He was smiling broadly and warmly now , his eyes wrinklingat the corners , the hard lines of his face almost gone . And then he offered me his hand , his entire hand this time , . not only the fingers , and I took it , and he held my hand a long time . I almost had the feeling he wanted to embrace me . Then our hands separated , and he went slowly up the aisle , his hands clasped behind his back , tall , a little stooped and , I thought , a little majestic . His young son trailed behind him , holding on to the caftan . Danny and I remained alone in the synagogue . It occurred to me suddenly that not a single word had passed between him and his father all evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you part of the way home , " Danny offered , and we went out of the brownstone and down the stone stairway to the street . I could hear the caps of his shoes clearly against the stone of the stairway , and then ' against the cement pavementof the sidewalk . It was night now , and cool , and a breeze blew against the sycamores and moved softly through the leaves . We walked in silence until Lee Avenue , then turned left . I was walking quickly , and Danny kept pace with my steps . Walking along Lee Avenue , Danny said quietly , " I know what you 're thinking . You think he 's a tyrant . " I shook my head . " I do n't know what to think . One minute he 's a tyrant , the next minute he 's kind and gentle . I do n't know what to think . " " He 's got a lot on his mind , " Danny said . " He 's a pretty complicated person . " " Do you always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , sure . I do n't mind it . I even enjoy it a little . " " I 've never seen anything like it in my life . "  | " It 's a family tradition , " Danny explained . " My father 's fatherused to do it with him . It goes all the way back . " " It would scare me sick . " " It 's not that bad . The bad part is waiting until he makes the mistake . After that it 's all right . But the mistakes are n't really very hard to find . He makes ones that he knows I can find . It 's a kind of game almost . " " Some game ! " " The second mistake tonight caught me off guard . But he made that one for you , really . That was very good , the way you caught it . He knew I would n't catch it . He just wanted to catch me , so he could tell me I was n't listening . He was right . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it even if I had listened . I 'm no good in math . I 've got a photographic memory for everything except math . You ca n't memorize math . You have to have a certain kind of head for it . " " I hate to tell you what I think about that game , " I said , a little heatedly . " What happens if you miss the mistake ? " " I have n't missed in years . " " What happens when you do miss ? " He was silent a moment . " It 's uncomfortable for a while , " he said quietly . " But he makes a joke or something , and we go into a Talmud discussion . " " What a game ! " I said . " In front of all those people ! " " They love it , " Danny said . " They 're very proud to see us like that . They love to hear the Talmud discussed like that . Did you see their faces ? " " I saw them , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does your father always use gematriya when he talks ? " " Not always . Very rarely , as a matter of fact . The people love it and always hope for it . But he does it rarely . I think he did it tonight only because you were there . " " He 's good at it , I 'll say that much . " " He was n't too good tonight . Some of it was a little forced . He was fantastic a few months ago . He did it with Talmudic laws then . He was really great . " " I thought it was n't bad tonight . " " Well , it was n't too good . He has n't been feeling too well . He 's worried about my brother . " " What 's wrong with your brother ? "  | " 1 do n't know . They do n't talk about it . Something about his blood . He 's been sick for a few years now . " " I 'm sorry to hear that , Danny . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor taking care of him now . He 'll be all right . " His voice had the same strange quality it had had when he had talked about his brother on our way over to the synagogue earlier in the day  --  hope , wistfulness , almost an eagerness for something to take place . I thought Danny must love his little brother very much , though I did n't remember his saying a word to him all the time they had been together . " Anyway , " Danny said , " these contests , as you call them , are going to end as soon as I start studying with Rav Gershenson . " " Who ? " " Rav Gershenson . He 's a great scholar . He 's at Hirsch College . He teaches Talmud there . My father says that when I 'm old enough to study with Rav Gershenson , I 'll be old enough for him not to worry whether I can catch him at mistakes or not . Then we 'll just have the Talmud discussions . I 'll like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Samson Raphael Hirsch Seminary and College was the only yeshiva in the United States that offered a secular collegeeducation . It was located on Bedford Avenue , a few blocks from Eastern Parkway . My father had told me once that it had been built in the early twenties by a group of OrthodoxJews who wanted their sons to have both a Jewish and a secular education . Its college faculty was supposed to be excellent , and its rabbinic faculty consisted of some of the greatest Talmudists in the United States . A rabbinic ordinationfrom its Talmud faculty was looked upon as the highest of Orthodox Jewish honors . It had been a foregone conclusion on my father 's part and on mine that I would go on to there after high school for my bachelor 's degree . When I told Danny that , his face burst into a smile . " Well , that 's wonderful ! " he said . " I 'm happy to hear that . That 's really wonderful ! " " So we 'll be going to the same college , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B.A. ? " " Sure . You have to . They do n't let you study just Talmud in that college . I 'll be majoring in psychology . "  |p139We  had come to the corner of the synagogue in which my father and I prayed . Danny stopped . " I have to go back , " he said . " I 've got schoolwork to do . " " I 'll call you at your house tomorrow afternoon . " " I 'll probably be in the library tomorrow afternoon , doing some reading in psychology . Why do n't you come over there ? " " I wo n't be able to read anything . " " That 's right. , " Danny smiled . " I forgot . You did n't duck . " " I 'll come over anyway . I 'll sit and think while you read . " " Wonderful . I 'd like to watch you sit and think . " " Mitnagdim can think too , you know . " I said . Danny laughed . " I 'll see you tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched him walk away , tall and lean in his black caftan and black hat . I hurried home and came into the apartment just as my fatherwas beginning to dial the phone . He put the phone down and looked , at me . " Do you know what time it is ? " he asked . " Is it very late ? " I glanced at my watch . It was almost tenthirty . " I 'm sorry , abba . I could n't just walk out . " " You were at Reb Saunders ' synagogue all this time ? " " Yes . " " Next time you are out so late you will call , yes ? I was ready to telephone Reb Saunders to find out what happened . Come into the kitchen and sit down . What are you looking so excited about ? Sit down . I 'll make some tea . Did you eat ? What happened that you were away so long ? " I sat at the kitchen table and slowly told my father everything that had taken place in Reb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly . I saw him grimace when I began to go over the gematriyot . My father did not particularlycare for gematriya . He had once referred to it as nonsensenumerology and had said that anything could be proved that way , all that had to be done was to shift letters around adroitly so as to make the values come out any way you wanted . So he sat there , sipping his tea and grimacing , as I reviewed Reb Saunders ' gematriyot . When I started to tell him what had happened afterward , the grimace left his face , and he listened intently , nodding his head from time to time and sipping his tea . And when I got to the part where Rebp140Saunders had asked me about the wrong gematriya , his face took on a look of astonishment , and he put the glass down on the table . Then I told him what Reb Saunders had said to me after Havdalah and what Danny and I had talked about on his way home , and he smiled proudly and nodded to indicatehis happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tea again , " you hadsome day , Reuven . " " It was an experience , abba . The way Danny had to answer his father 's questions like that in front of everybody . I thought that was terrible . " My father shook his head . " It is not terrible , Reuven . Not for Danny , not for his father , and not for the people who listened . It is an old tradition , this kind of Talmudic discussion . I have seen it many times , between great rabbis . But it does not only take place between rabbis . When Kant became a professor , he had to follow an old tradition and argue in public on a philosophical subject . One day when you are a professor in a university and read a paper before your colleagues , you will also have to answer questions . It is part of Danny 's training . " " But in public like that , abba ! " " Yes , Reuven . In public like that . How else would Reb Saunders ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It just seemed so cruel to me . " My father nodded . " It is a little cruel , Reuven . But that is the way the world is . If a person has a contribution to make , he must make it in public . If learning is not made public , it is a waste . But the business about the mistakes I never heard before . That is something new . That is Reb Saunders ' innovation . It is clear , but I am not sure I like it- very much . No , I do not think I like it at all . " " Danny said the mistakes are always easy to find . " " Perhaps , " my father said . " A man can do whatever he wishes to test his son 's knowledge . But there are other ways than the way of Reb Saunders . At any rate , Reuven , it is good training for Danny . He will be involved in such things all his life . " " Reb Saunders is a very complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One minute he 's hard and angry , the next minute he 's soft and gentle . I do n't understand him . "  | " Reb Saunders is a great man , Reuven . Great men are alwaysdifficult to understand . He carries the burden of many people on his shoulders . I do not care for his Hasidism very much , but it is not a simple task to be a leader of people . Reb Saunders is not a fraud . He would be a great man even if he had not inherited his post from his father . It is a pity he occupies his mind only with Talmud . If he were not a tzaddik he could make a great contribution to the world . But he lives only in his own world . It is a great pity . Danny will be the same way when he takes his father 's place . It is a shame that a mind such as Danny 's will be shut off from the world . " My father sipped his tea again , and we sat quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way you handled yourself today , " my father said , looking at me over the rim of the glass . " I am glad Reb Saunders will let you be Danny 's friend . I was worried about Reb Saunders . " " I 'm awfully sorry I came back so late , abba . " My father nodded . " I am not angry , " he said . " But next time you will be so late , you will call , yes ? " " Yes , abba . " My father glanced at the clock on the shelf over the refrigerator . " Reuven , it is late , and tomorrow you are going to school . You should go to sleep now . " " Yes , abba . " " Remember , you must not read . I will read to you in the evenings and we will see if we can study that way . ut you must not read by yourself . " " Yes , abba . Good night . " " Good night , Reuven . " I left him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went to bed . I lay awake a long time before I was able to sleep.  |p142WHEN  I GOT BACK to school the next morning , I found I had become a hero , and during the fifteen-minute morning recess my friends , and even some boys I did not know , all crowded around me , wanting to know how I was and telling me what a great game I had played . Near the end of the recess , I went over to the pitcher 's position and stood on the exact spot where I had been hit by the ball , I looked  --  tried to look ; the yard was crowded with students  --  at home plate and imaginedDanny standing there , grinning at me . I remembered his grinning that way again yesterday , and I closed my eyes for a moment , then went over and stood near the wire fence behind the plate . The bench on which the young rabbi had sat was still there , and I stared at it for a moment . It seemed impossible to me that the ball game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things had happened , and everything looked so different . Sidney Goldberg came over to me and started talking about the game , and then Davey Cantor joined us and added his opinion about " those murderers . " I nodded at what they were saying without really listening . It seemed silly to me , the way they kept talking about the game , they both sounded so childish , and I got a little angry when Davey Cantor started talking about " that snooty Danny Saunders , " but I did n't say anything . I got out of school at two o'clock and took a trolley car over to the public library where I was supposed to meet Danny . The library was a huge , three-story , graystone building , with thick Ionic columns , and with the words BEAUTY ISTRUTH , TRUTH BEAUTY , THAT IS ALL YE KNOW ON EARTH , ANDALL YE NEED TO KNOW  --  JOHN KEATS engraved in the stoneover its four glass entrance doors . It stood on a wide bottle/vard and there were tall trees in front of it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall of the vestibule , just inside the doors , there was a mural of the history of great ideas , beginning with a drawing of Moses holding the Ten Commandments , going on to Jesus , Mohammed , Galileo , Luther , Copernicus , Kepler , Newton , and ending with Einstein gazing at the formula E=MC2 . On the other wall there was a mural showing Homer , Dante , Tolstoi , Balzae , and Shakespeareengaged in conversation . They were beautiful murals , done in bright colors , and the great men in them looked alive . Probably because I had become so sensitive about eyes the past week , I noticed for the first time that Homer 's eyes seemed glazed , almost without pupils , as if the artist had been trying to show that he had been blind . I had never noticed that before , and it frightened me a little to see it now . I went quickly through the first floor , with its marble floors , its marble pillars , its tall bookcases , its long reference tables , its huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desks at which the librarians sat . I found Danny on the third floor against the far wall , partly hidden by a bookcase , wearing a black suit , a tieless shirt , and a skullcap . He was sitting at a small table , bent over a book , his long earlocks dangling down the sides of his face and almostreaching to the top of the table . There were not many people on this floor ; its stacks were filled mostly with bound volumes of scholarly journals and pamphlets . It was a large floor , and the closely set stacks gave it a mazelike appearance . They went from floor to ceiling , and they seemed to me to contain everything of importance that had ever been written on any subject in the world . There were journals in English , French , German , Russian , Italian , and even one collection in Chinese . Some of the English journalshad names I could n't pronounce . This was the one floor of the three-floored library I did not know well . I had been up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Logic which had been recommended to me by my mathematicsteacher , an article which I had only dimly understood , and once to meet my father . Now was the third time in all the years I had belonged to this library that I was on its third floor . I stood near a bookcase a few feet away from the table atp144which Danny was sitting , and I watched him read . His elbowswere on the table , and he held his head in the palms of his hands , the fingers covering his ears completely , his eyes staring down at the book . Occasionally , the fingers of his right hand would play with his earlock , and once they stroked the tufts of sand-colored hair on his chin for a few seconds , then went back to the side of his face . His mouth was slightly open , and I could not see his eyes ; they were hiddenby the lids . He seemed impatient each time he came to the foot of a page , and he flipped the page with a quick gestureof his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning the page by pushing upward with the finger against the lower right-hand corner , the way one does a page of Talmud  --  except that with a Talmud the left forefinger usually pushes against the lower left-hand corner because it is read from right to left . He was reading with phenomenal speed . I could almost see him read . He would start at the head of a page , his head tilted slightly upward , and then his head would move downward in a straight line until he got to the foot of the page . Then it would tilt upward again and eithermove sideways to the right page or remain fixed in its upward position until the page was turned , and then start downward again . He did not seem , to be reading from side to side but up and down , and , watching him , I had the distinct impression that he was reading the middle of the page only and was somehow able to ignore , or absorb without actually reading , what was written on the sides . I decided not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table a few feet away and continued to watch him read . It was frustrating to be sitting there surrounded by all those journals and not be able to read a thing myself , and I decided after a while to review by heart some of the symbolic logic I had been studying . I closed my eyes and went over the propositionalcalculus , trying to visualize the truth tables for conjunction , disjunction , equivalence , and material implication . They were fairly simple , and I had no difficulty . I tried to do some problems , but after a while it became complicated , I could n't remember all the deductive steps , and I stopped . I was about to begin going over the steps of indirect proof when I heard Danny say , " You 're always sleepimg !  |p145What  a sleepyhead you are ! " and I opened my eyes . Danny was sitting up in his chair and looking at me . " I was reviewing my logic , " I told him . " I was n't sleeping . " " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded sad . " I was just going into the indirect proof . Do you want tohear it ? " " No . I ca n't stand that stuff . Why did n't you tell me you were here ? " " I did n't want to disturb you . " " You 're nice . For a Misnaged . " He gave the Hebrew letter " tof " its Ashkenazic pronunciation . " Come over here . I want you to see something . " I went over to his table and sat down next to him . " I 'm not allowed to read , you know . " " I want you to hear this . I 'll read it to you . " " What is it ? " " It 's from Graetz 's History of the Jews . " He sounded unhappy , and there was a somber look on his face . " It 's about Hasidim . Listen . Graetz is talking about Dov Baer , who was the follower of the Besht . He just finished saying that Dov Baer invented the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hook on the table and began to read aloud . " ' Baer 's idea , however , was not meant to remain idle and unfruitful , but to bring him honor and revenue . While the tzaddik cared for the conduct of the world , for the obtaining of heavenly grace , and especially for Israel 's preservation and glorification , his adherents had to cultivate three kinds of virtues . It was their duty to draw nigh to him , to enjoy the sight of him , and from time to time to make pilgrimages to him . Further , they were to confess their sins to him . By these means alone could they hope for pardon from their iniquities . ' That means sins , " he told me . " I know what it means , " I said . He went on . " Finally , they had to bring him presents , rich gifts , which he knew how to employ to the best advantage . It was also incumbent upon them to attend to his personalwants . It seems like a return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulgar and disgusting do these perversities appear . ' " He looked up from the book . " That 's pretty strong language , vulgar and disgusting . ' " His eyes were dark andp146brooding . " It feels terrible to have a great scholar like Graetz call Hasidism vulgar and disgusting . I never thought of my father as a priest of Baal . " I did n't say anything . " Listen to what else he says about Dov Baer . " He turned a page . " He says here that Dov Baer used to crack vulgar jokes to make his people happy , and that he used to encourage his followers to drink alcohol , so they would pray fervently . He says that Rabbi Elijah of Vilna was a great opponent of the Hasidim , and that when he died  --  let me read it to you . " He shuffled pages . " Here it is . Listen . After his death , the Hasidimtook vengeance upon him by dancing upon his grave , and celebrating the day of his decease as a holiday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " I never knew about any of these things . You were in our shul yesterday . Did anyone look drunk to you during the service ? " " No , " I said . " My father is n't like that at all . " His voice was sad , and it trembled a little . " He really worries about his people . He worries about them so much he does n't even have time to talk to me . " " Maybe Graetz is only talking about the Hasidim of his own day , " I offered . " Maybe , " he said , not convinced . " It 's awful to have someonegive you an image like that of yourself . He says that Dov Baer had expert spies worthy of serving in the secret service . Those are his words , worthy of serving in the secret service . ' He says they would go around discovering people 's secrets and tell them to Dov Baer . People who came to see him about their personal problems would have to wait around until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these spies would investigate them and report back to him , so that when the person finally got to see him , Dov Baer would know everything , and the person would be impressed and think that Dov Baer had some sort of magical ability to look into his heart . " He shuffled some more pages . " Listen to this , In the first interview Baer , in a seemingly casual manner , was able , in a skillfully arranged discourse , to bring in allusions to these strangers , whereby they would be convinced that he had looked into their hearts and knew their past . ' " He shook his head sadly . " I never knew about anything likep147that . When my father talks about Dov Baer , he almost makes him out to be a saint . " " Did my father give you that book to read ? " " Your father said I should read Jewish history . He said the first important step in anyone 's education is to know your own people . So I found this work by Graetz . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . This is the last volume . " He shook his head again , and the earlocks danced and brushed against the ridge of his jaw and the hollow of his cheeks . " What an image it gives me of myself . " " You ought to discuss it with my father first , " I told him , " before you go believing any of that . He told me a lot about Hasidism on Friday night . He was n't very complimentary , but he did n't say anything about drunkenness . " Danny nodded slowly . " I 'll talk to him , " he said . " But Graetz was a great scholar . I read up on him before I started reading his history . He was one of the greatest Jewish scholarsof the last century . " " You ought to discuss it with my father , " I repeated . Danny nodded again , then slowly closed the book . His fingersplayed idly with the spine of the binding . " You know , " he brooded , " I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the most mysterious thing in the universe to man is man himself . We 're blind about the most important thing in our lives , our own selves . How could a man like Dov Baer have the gall to fool other people into thinking that he could look inside their hearts and tell them what they were really like inside ? " " You do n't know that he did . You only know Graetz 's versionof it . " He ignored me . I had the feeling he was talking more to himself than to me . " We 're so complicated inside , " he went on quietly . " There 's something in us called the unconscious that we 're completely unaware of . It practically dominates our lives , and we do n't even know it . " He paused , hesitating , his hand movingfrom the book and playing now with an cadmic . I was reminded of the evening in the hospital when he had stared out the window at the people on the street below and had talked of God and ants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's so much to read , " he said . " I 've only really beenp148reading for a few months . Did you know about the subconscious ? " he asked me , and when I somewhat hesitantly nodded , he said , " You see ? You 're not even interested in psychology , and you know about it . I have so much catching up to do . " He was suddenly conscious of the way his fingers were playing with the earlock , and he let his hand drop to the table . " Did you know that very often the subconscious expressesitself in dreams ? The dream is the product of a transactionbetween conscious and unconscious wishes , ' " he quoted , " ' and the results during sleep are naturally very different from those during waking hours . ' " " What 's this about dreams ? " I asked . " It 's true , " he said . " Dreams are full of unexpressed fears and hopes , things that we never even think of consciously . We think of them unconsciously deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They do n't always come out straight , though . Sometimes they come out in symbols . You have to learn to interpret the symbols . " " Where did you find out about that ? " " In my reading . There 's a lot of work been done on dreams . It 's one of the ways they have of getting to a person'sunconscious . " I must have had a strange expression on my face , because he asked me what was the matter . " I dream all the time , " I told him . " Everyone does , " he said . " We just do n't remember a lot of them . We repress them . We sort of push them away and forget them , because sometimes they 're too painful . " " I 'm trying to remember mine , " I said . " Some of them were n't very pleasant . " " A lot of times they 're not pleasant . Our unconscious is n't a nice place  --  I call it a place ; it is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's more like a process -- - , it is n't a nice place at all . It 's full of repressed fears and hatreds , things that we 're afraid to bring out into the open . " " And these things rule our lives ? " " According to some psychologists they do . " " You mean these things go on and we do n't know anything about them ? " " That 's right . That 's what I said before . What 's inside us is the greatest mystery of all . "  | " That 's a pretty sad thing to think about . To be doing things without really knowing why you 're doing them . " Danny nodded . " You can find out about it , though . About your unconscious , I mean . That 's what psychoanalysis is all about . I have n't read too much about it yet , but it 's a long process . Freud started it . You 've heard about Freud . He started psychoanalysis . I 'm teaching myself German , so I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . " I stared at him and felt a shock of coldness move inside me . " You 're studying German ? " He seemed surprised at my reaction . " What 's wrong with studying German ? Freud wrote in German . What are you looking at me like that for ? " " Are n't his writings translated into English ? " " Not all of them . Besides , I want to read a lot of other things in German that have n't been translated yet . What 's the matter with you ? You 've got the funniest look on your face . " I did n't say anything . " Just because Hitler speaks German does n't mean that the language is corrupt . It 's the most important scientific languagein the world . What are you looking at me like that for ? " " I 'm sorry , " I said . " It just seems strange to me , your studying German . " " What 's so strange about it ? " " Nothing . How are you teaching it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the reference library . I 'm almostdone memorizing it . It 's an interesting language . Very technical and precise . It 's amazing the way they put nouns together . Do you know what the word for mysterious ' is in German ? " " I do n't know any German . " " It 's geheimnisvoll . ' It means full of secret . ' That 's what the subconscious is , geheimnisvoll . ' The word for ' sympathetic ' is teitnahmsvoll '  - -   - -  literally full of part-taking . ' The word for charity is Wtichstenliebe '  --  literally , it means  --  " " All right , " I said . " I 'm impressed . " " It 's quite a language . Yiddish is a lot like it . Yiddish was originally Middle German . When the German Jews came into Poland , they brought it with them . "  | " You mean in the thirteenth century , when Poland encouragedthe Jews to come in ? " " That 's right . You know about that . " " I did n't know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either . At least , I do n't think he doe He thinks Yiddish is almost holy . But it 's really from Middy German . " I was going to ask him what the Middle meant in Middy German , but I decided not to push the conversation any fus they . I was upset enough as it was about his learning Gel man . And it had nothing to do with Hitler , either . I kept re membering what my father had told me about Solomon M &; mon . It all sounded so weird . I almost had the feeling I we talking to Maimon 's ghost . We talked some more about Graetz 's version of Hasidism and then somehow we got onto the subject of Danny ' ; brother . He had been examined by a big doctor that morning . and the doctor had said he would be all right , but that h : would have to be careful , no strenuous studying or exercis ing . He had gone with his father , and Danny said his father was now very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! right . It had something to do with his blood chemistry . Danny said , and the doctor had prescribed three differen pills for him to take . He had n't been very optimistic about the condition clearing up , either . He said he would have to take the pills as long as it persisted . " It might persist his whole life , " Danny said sadly . Again , I got the impression that he loved his brother very much , and I wondered was he had n't said a word to him during all the time I had seen . them together yesterday in the synagogue . Finally , we decided it was getting late , and we started down the wide marble staircase . When we were about halfwaydown the staircase to the second floor , Danny stoppec and looked carefully around . He did the same when we were going down to the main floor . He replaced the Graetz book , and we went outside . It was cloudy and seemed ready to rain , so we decided to take a trolley car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block , and I rode the rest of the way alone , my head full of what we had talked about , especially his teaching himself German.  |p151I  told my father about it over the supper table . " What does Danny want to read in German ? " he asked me . " He wants to read Freud . " My father 's eyes went wide behind their spectacles . " He was very excited about it , " I said . " He was talking about the unconscious and dreams . He was also reading Graetz on Hasidism . " " The unconscious and dreams , " my father muttered . " And Freud . At the age of fifteen . " He shook his head gloomily . " But it will not be possible to stop him . " " Abba , was Graetz right in what he said about Hasidism ? " " Graetz was biased , and his sources were not accurate . If I remember correctly , he calls the Hasidim vulgar drunkards , and he calls the tzaddikim priests of Baal . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I met Danny again in the library later that week , but he was n't too enthusiastic when I told him what my father had said about Graetz . He told me he had read another book on Hasidism , and while the author had n't accused the tzaddikim of encouraging drinking , he had accused them of almost everything else . I asked him how he was coming along with his German , and he said he had finished memorizing the grammar text and was reading a book he had borrowed from the German section of the library . He said he hoped to start reading Freud in a few weeks . I did n't tell him what my fatherhad said about that . He looked upset and tense , and he kept playing with an earlock all the time we talked . My father told me that night that there had been a serious question in his mind about how ethical it was for him to give Danny books to read behind his father 's back . " How would I feel if someone gave you books to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked him why he had done it . because Danny would have continued to read anyway on his own . At least this way he has some direction from an adult . It was a fortunate accident that he stumbled upon me . But it is not a comfortable feeling , Reuven . I dislike doing this to Reb Saunders . He is certain to find out one day . It will be an uncomfortable situation when he does . But he will notp152be able to stop Danny from reading . What will he do when his son goes to college ? " I pointed out to my father that Danny was anyway reading . on his own now , without direction from an adult . My fathe certainly had n't told him to read Freud . My father nodded his agreement . " But he will come to mes to discuss what he reads , " he said . " At least there will be balance . I will give him other books to read , and he will se , that Freud is not God in psychology . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head gloomily . Danny and I arranged to spend Shabbat afternoon togethez with his father , studying Pirkei Avot . When I turned off Le Avenue that Shabbat and started up the sunless street on which Danny lived , the feeling of having crossed into a twilightworld wat only a little less strong than it had been the week before . It was just after three o'clock , and there were no bearded , caftaned men or kerchief-wearing women on the street , but the children were outside , playing , shouting , running . Except for the children , the sidewalk in front of the three-story brownstone at the end of the block was deserted . I remembered how the black-caftaned men had parted for Danny and me the week before , and I remembered , too , the tapping of Danny 's capped shoes on the pavement as we had gone through the crowd and up the wide stone staircase . The door in the hallway that led into the synagogue was open , but the synagogue was empty  --  except for the echoes it contained . I stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloths , but the food had not yet been put out . I stared at the table where I had sat , and I could still hear the gematriyot tumbling out of Reb Saunders ' mouth and then his question to Danny , " Nothing more ? You have nothing more to say ? " I saw the idiot grin spread itself slowly across Danny 's lips . I turned quickly and went back out into the hall . I stood at the foot of the inside stairway and called up , " Hello ! Anybody home ? " After a moment , Danny appeared at the head of the stairs , wearing his black caftan , black pants , and a black skullcap , and told me to come on up . He introduced me to his mother and sister . His sister was almost as tall as I , with dark , vivacious eyes and a face al/most exactly like Danny 's , except that the sculptured lines were a good deal softer . She wore a long-sleeved dress , and her dark hair was combed back severely and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me and said , " I know all about you , Reuven Matter . Danny never stops talking about you . " His mother was short , with blue eyes and a roundish body . Her head was covered with a kerchief , and there were faint tufts of sand-colored hair on her upper lip . They were both sitting in the living room and had apparently been reading or studying what looked to me to be a Yiddish book when we had interrupted them . I told them politely that it was nice to meet them and was rewarded with another smile from Danny 's sister . We left them and started up the stairway to the third floor . Danny explained that the third floor contained his room , his father 's study , and a conference room . The second and third floors were completely separated , just as they were in any three-story brownstone . They had thought once of moving the family to the third floor , Danny said , so as to avoid the noise made by the people who were constantly climbing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't well , and a three-floor climb would be too much for h'er . I asked him how his brother was feeling . " All right , I guess , " he told me . " He 's asleep now . " Danny took me through the third-floor rooms . They were identical with the ones in which my father and I lived . Danny'sbedroom was located exactly where my father 's bedroom was , the kitchen had been left intact  --  to serve the visiting dignitaries tea , Danny said with a grin  --  the bathroom was next to the kitchen , the study was where my father 's study was  --  except that one of its walls had been knocked out so that it also included what in our apartment was my room  --  and the living room contained a long glass-topped conference table and leather chairs . Danny took me into the conference room first  --  we went through the outside hallway door  --  then into his room , which had a narrow bed , a bookcasefull of old Hebrew and Yiddish books , and a desk clutteredwith papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The walls were white and bare . All the walls were white and bare . I saw no photographs or paintings anywhere , neither onp154the floor where his family lived , nor here on the floor where he lived and his father worked . We stood outside his father 's study , and Danny knocked softly on the door . " He does n't like me to barge in on him when he 's in there , " he whispered with a grin . His father said to come in , and we went in . Reb Saunders sat behind a massive , black wood , glasstoppeddesk , wearing a black caftan and a tall , round , black skullcap . He was sitting in a straight-backed red leather chair with intricately carved wooden arms . A single light bulb glowed white behind its ceiling fixture . The study , with its additionalroom , seemed enormous . A thick red carpet covered its floor , and its walls were lined with glass-enclosed wooden bookcases jammed tight with books . There were books everywhere  --  onthe two wooden chairs near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file cabinet that stood near the door , on cardboard boxes piled in a corner , on the small wooden stepladder , on the black leather easy chair that stood in another corner , even on the window seat . Many of the books were bound in black , red , and brown leather . One book had been bound in white , and it stood out prominently on a shelf among the black-bound books around it . Danny told me later that it contained the sayings of the alai Shem Tov and had been presented to his father as a gift on his fiftieth birthday by the members of his congregation . All the books seemed to be in Hebrew or Yiddish , and many of them were very old and in their original bindings . There was a musty odor in the room , the odor of old books with yellow leaves and ancient bindings . Reb Saunders told us to clear the books off the two chairs near the desk . The desk stood in almost the exact spot where my father had his desk . Danny sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reb Saunders wanted to know about my eye . I told him it was n't bothering me at all and that I was supposed to see the doctor this Monday morning . He understood I was not permitted to read . I nodded . " So you will listen , " he told me , playing with an earlock . " You are a good mathematician . Now we will see what you know about more important things . " He said it with a smile on his lips , and I did not feel it as a challenge . I knew I could not match him and Dannyp155in the breadth of their knowledge , but I wondered if I might not he able to keep up with them in terms of depth . Rabbinic literature can be studied in two different ways , in two directions , one might say . It can be studied quantitatively or qualitatively  --  or , as my father once put it , horizontally or vertically . The former involves covering as much material as possible , without attempting to wrest from it all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one single area until it is exhaustively covered , and then going on to new material . My father , in his classes and when he studiedwith me at home , always used the latter method . The ideal , of course , was to be able to do both , but none of the students in my school had that kind of time available to him because of the school 's heavy emphasis on English studies . Reb Saunders had a text of Pirkei Avot open in front of him . He began to read from it , stopping at the end of each passage . Danny and I took turns explaining each alternating passage . I realized soon enough that the Pirkei Avot text was merely being used as a sort of jumping-off point for them , because they were soon ranging through most of the major tractates of the Talmud again . And it was n't a quiz or a quiet contest this time , either . It was a pitched battle . With no congregantsaround , and with me an accepted member of the family , Danny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wild gestures of their hands almost to where I thought they might come to blows . Danny caught his father in a misquote , ran to get a Talmud from a shelf , and triumphantly showed his father where he had been wrong . His father checked the margin of the page for the textual corrections of Rabbi Elijah  --  the same Rabbi Elijah who had persecuted Hasidim !  --  and showed Danny that he had been quoting from the corrected text . Then they went on to anothertractate , fought over another passage , and this time Reb Saunders agreed , his face glowing , that his son was correct . I sat quietly for a long time , watching them battle . There was an ease about them , an intimacy , which had been totally lacking from the show they had put on before the congregantslast week . There was no tension here at all but a battle between equals , with Reb Saunders losing only a little less frequently than his son . And I soon realized something else : Reb Saunders was far happier when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glowed with fierce pride and his headnodded wildly  --  the nod beginning from the waist and includingthe entire upper portion of his body , with the beard movingback and forth against his chest  --  each time he wasforced to acquiesce to Danny 's rendition of a passage or toDanny 's incisive counterquestioning The battle went on fora long time , and I slowly became aware of the fact that both Danny and his father , during a point they might be makingor listening to , would cast inquisitive glances at me , as if to ask what I was doing just sitting there while all this excitewasgoing on : Why in the world was n't I joining in thebattle ? I listened to them for a few minutes longer , and then I realized that though they knew so much more material than I did , once a passage was quoted and briefly explained , Iwas on amos equaoong wt tem.a ts tmeeen able to retain hold of the chain of the argument  --  probablybecause there was no tension now  --  and so when Reb Saunderscited and explained a passage that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Danny , I suddenly found myself on the field of combat , offering an interpretation of the passage in support of Danny . Neither of them seemed at all surprised to hear my voice  --  I had the feeling they were surprised they had n't heard it sooner  --  and from that point on the three of us seesawed back and forth through the infiniteintricacies of the Talmud . I discovered that my father 's method of teaching me Talmud and his patient insistence that I learn Talmudic grammar  --  I had painfully memorized an Aramaic grammar book  --  was now standing me in good stead . I saw allusions in passages that Danny and his father overlooked and I resolved a contradiction with an appeal togrammar . " Grammar ! " Reb Saunders threw up his hands . " Grammar we need yet ! " But I insisted , explained , cajoled , raised my voice , gestured with my hands , quoted whatever proof texts I could remember from the grammar book , and finally he accepted my explanations . I found I was enjoying it all immensely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Talmud  --  it was the grammatical discussion of the gender of " derech , " road , in the tractate Kiddushin before Reb Saunders realized what I was doing and told me to stop , I was n't allowed to use my eye yet , Danny would read the passage . Danny did n't need to read the passage  --  he quoted itp157by heart with mechanical swiftness . It became clear quickly enough that though I was unequal to Danny in breadth , I was easily equal to him in depth , and this seemed to please Reb Saunders enormously . Danny and I were soon involved in a heated discussion concerning two contradictory commentaries on the same passage , and Reb Saunders sat back quietly and listened . Our argument ended in a draw ; we agreed that the passage was obscure and that as it stood it could be explained either way . There was a pause . Reb Saunders suggested quietly that Danny might go down and bring us some tea . Danny left . The silence that now replaced our loud voices was almost uncomfortable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right hand . I heard Danny 's capped shoes in the apartment hallway outside the study . Then the door opened and closed . Reb Saunders stirred and looked at me . " You have a good head , " he said softly . The Yiddish phrase he used was , literally translated , " an iron head . " He nodded , seemed to listen for a moment to the silence in the study , then folded his arms across his chest . He sighed loudly , his eyes suddenly sad . " Now we will see about your soul , " he said softly . " Reuven , my son will return soon . We have little time to talk . I want you to listen to me . I know that my Daniel spends hours almost every day in the public library . No , do not say anything . Just listen . I know you are surprised that I know . It is not important how I found it out . The neighborhood is not so big that he could hide this from me forever . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , I want to know where he is . Nu , now I know . I also know that he is sometimes with you in the library and sometimes with your father . I want you to tell me what he reads . I could ask my son , but it is difficult for me to speak to him . I know you do not understand that . But it is true . I can not ask my son . One day perhaps I will tell you the reason . I know the mind he has , and I know I can no longer tell him what yes to read and what not to read . I am asking you to tell me what he reads . " I sat frozen and felt a long moment of blind panic . What my father had anticipated was now actually happening . Butp158he had n't anticipated it happening to me . He had thought Reb Saunders would confront him , not me . My father and I had acted behind Reb Saunders ' back ; now Reb Saunders was asking me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to say . Reb Saunders looked at me and sighed again . " Rea ven , " he said very quietly , " I want you to hear me out . No onelives forever . My father led his people before me , and mygrandfather before him , and my great-grandfather before him . For six generations now we have led our people . I willnot live forever . Daniel will one day take my place  --  " Hisvoice broke , and he stopped . He put a finger to one of hiseyes . Then he went on , his voice a little hoarse now . " My sonis my most precious possession . I have nothing in the world compared to my son . I must know what he is reading . And I can not ask him . " He stopped and looked down at an open Talmud on his desk . " How did he come to meet your father in the library ? " he asked , looking down at the Talmud . I sat very still and said nothing . I realized I was sitting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How long would Reb Saunders remain silent about his son 's visits to the library ? And I did n't like the way my father seemed to appear in all of this  --  as if he were conspiring behindReb Saunders ' back to contaminate his son . I took a deep breath and began to talk slowly , choosing my words with care . I told Reb Saunders everything , how Danny had met my father , why my father was suggesting books for him to read , what he was reading , how my father was helping him  --  omitting that Danny was studying German , that he planned to read Freud , and that he had read some books on Hasidism . When I finished , Reb Saunders just sat there and stared at me . I could see he was controlling himself with great effort . He covered his eyes and nose with his right hand and leaned forward , his elbow on the open Talmud , the upper portion of his body swaying slowly back and forth . I saw his lips move beneath the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Universe , psychology . And Darwin . " They came out as a soft , whispered moan . e took the hand away from his face and let it drop to the Talmud . " What can I do ? " he asked himself softly . " I can no longer speak to my own son.  |p159The  Master of the Universe gave me a brilliant son , a phenomenon . And I can not speak to him . " He looked at me and seemed suddenly aware again of my presence . " The pain of raising children , " he said quietly . " So many troubles . So many troubles . Reuven , you and your father will be a good influence on my son , yes ? " I nodded slowly , afraid now to speak . " You will not make a goy out of my son ? " I shook my head , feeling numb at what I was hearing . His voice was an ache , a plea . I saw him stare up at the ceiling . " Master of the Universe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant son , and I have thanked you for him a million times . But you had to make him so brilliant ? " I listened to his voice and felt myself go cold . There was so much pain in it , so much bewildered pain . The apartment door opened and closed . Reb Saunders sat up in his chair , his face quickly regaining its composure . Clearly , almost like an echo in a cave , I heard the tap-tap-tap of Danny 's metal-capped shoes against the linoleum hallway floor . Then he was in the study , carrying a tray with three glasses of tea , sugar , spoons , and some of his mother 's cookies . I pushed some books aside on the desk , and he put the tray down . From the moment he entered the room and saw my face , I knew he was aware that something had happened during his absence . We sipped our tea in silence , and I saw him glance at me from over the rim of his glass . He knew , all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . What was I supposed to tell him ? That his father now knew he was reading forbidden books and was not going to try to stop him ? Reb Saunders had n't said anything about not tellingDanny what had gone on between us . I looked at him for a clue , but he was sipping his tea calmly . I hoped Danny would n't ask me today . I wanted to talk to my father first . Reb Saunders put his glass down and folded his arms across his chest . He was acting as though nothing at all had happened . " Tell me more about grammar in the Talmud , Reuven , " he said to me , with a gentle hint of mockery in his voice . " All my life I have studied Talmud and paid no attention to grammar . Now you tell me a person must know grammar top160know Talmud . You see what happens when you have a fatherwho is a Misnaged ? Grammar yet . Mathematics -- -nu , a:l right . Mathematics I can understand . But grammar ! " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for the Afternoon Service . Danny found his father 's deliberate mistake easily , and I was able to follow the ensuing Talmudic discussion without too much difficulty , though I did not join in . After the Evening Service , Danny said he would walk me part of the way home , and as we turned into Lee Avenue he asked me what had happened between me and his father that afternoon . I told him everything . He listened in silence , not seeming at all surprised that his father somehow had learned of hislook into my soul . . e told me to stop rumling to him everysecret visits to the library . " I knew he would find out about it sooner or later " he said softly , looking very sad . " I hope you do n't mind my telling him , Danny . I had to . " He shrugged . His eyes were moist and gloomy . " I almost wish he had asked me instead , " he said quietly . " But we do n't talk anymore , except when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " " It 's what I told you in the hospital . My father believes in silence . When I was ten or eleven years old , I complained to him about something , and he told me to close my mouth andtime I had a problem . I should look into my own soul for the answer , he said . We just do n't talk , Reuven . " " I do n't understand that at all . " " I 'm not so sure I understand it myself , " he said gloomily . " But that 's the way he is . I do n't know how he found out I was reading behind his back , but I 'm glad he knows about it . At least I wo n't have to walk around in that library scared to death . I just feel bad having had to fool my father like that . But what else could I have done ? " I agreed with him that he could n't have done anything else , but I told him I wished he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ca n't , " he said , shaking his head . " I just ca n't . You do n't know what torture it was talking to him about organizing ap161ball team . We just do n't talk , Reuven . Maybe it sounds a littlecrazy to you . But it 's true . " " I think you ought to at least try . " " I ca n't ! " he said , a little angry now . " Do n't you listen to what I 'm saying ? I just ca n't ! " " I do n't understand it , " I told him . " Well , I ca n't explain it to you any better than I have , " he said angrily . When we stopped in front of the synagogue where my father and I prayed , he muttered his " Good night , " turned , and walked slowly away . My father seemed astonished when I told him what Danny had said to me . " Silence ? What do you mean , Danny is being brought up in silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk , abba . Except when they study Talmud . That 's what Danny told me " He stared at me for a long time . Then he seemed to remembersomething , and his eyes narrowed suddenly . " Once in Russia I heard something , " he murmured softly , speaking to himself . " But I did not believe it . " " Heard what , abba ? " He looked at me , his eyes somber , and shook his head . " I am happy Reb Saunders knows now about his son 's reading , " he said quietly , evading my question . " I was concerned about all this subterfuge . " " But why ca n't he talk to Danny about it ? " " Reuven , he has already talked to Danny about it . He has talked to Danny through you . " I stared at him . He sighed softly . " It is never pleasant to be a buffer , Reuven , " he told me quietly . And he would say nothing more about the strange silence between Reb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day and spent the afternoon and evening listening to my father read to me from my textbooks . At nine o'clock on Monday morning , my father took me to , Dr. Snydman 's office on Eastern Parkway . We were both nervous and silent on the way over . I had taken my school books with me , because we planned to go straight from Dr. Snydman 's office to the school . Dr. Snydmanlooked at my eye and told me I was fine , it had healed perfectly , I could read now , play ball , swim , do whatever I wanted , just so long as I did n't try to stop a fast ball anymore with my head . My father 's eyes were misty when we left the office , and I cried a little during the trolley ride to school . We stood outside the school , my father kissed my forehead and said thank God that it had all ended well , and now he had to go to his class , he had already missed one class today because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the substitute teacher 's life miserable . I grinned , then nodded when he told me to go to my class . He went off . As I climbed the stairs to the second floor , I realized I had forgotten to ask Dr. Snydman about Billy . I decided I would call Billy later in the week after my exams , and go over to see him . That was a busy week . The final exams began that Monday afternoon . It was wonderful to be able to read and write again , and I did n't mind it at all that my first reading and writing in fifteen days was being done over final examinations . It was a kind of wild , soaring experience to be able to hold a pen again and look into a book or at a piece of paper with writing on it . I took my exams and enjoyed them immensely . I did n't see Danny that entire week . He called me on  |p163Wednesday  night , sounding sad , and we talked for a while . I asked him what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he always stayed home in the summer , studying Talmud . He added that he would probably also be reading Freud this summer . I said I would come over to his house that Shabbat and we could talk some more then , I was busy now studying for finals , and I hung up . His voice had been quiet , subdued , and I wondered if he had been reading any more books on Hasidism . I took the last exam on Friday morning , and then the year was over ; I was free until September . I was n't worried about my grades . I knew I had done well . When I came home from school early Friday afternoon , Malaya asked me if I was hungry , and I said yes , I could eat a horse , a kosher horse , of course , and she quickly put a lunch on the table . My father came in a few minutes later and joined me . There had been a terrible storm in Europe that entire week , he told me , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thank God . I had n't heard anything about it , I had been so busy with my exams . My father left right after lunch , and I went over to the telephone to call Billy . I found his father 's name in the phone book and dialed the number . " Hello , " a man 's voice said . " Mr. Merrit ? " " That 's right . " " This is Reuven Malter , sir . " " Who ? " " Reuv  --  Bobby Malter . I had the bed next to Billy in the hospital . " " Oh , yes . Yes . Bobby Malter . " " Do you remember me , sir ? " " Of course . Of course I remember you . " " How is Billy , sir ? " There was a pause . " Sir ? " " Yes ? " " Is Billy all right ? " " I 'm afraid not . The surgery was not successful . " I felt myself break out into a cold sweat . The hand holdingp164the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone against my face to keep it steady . " Hello ? " " Yes , sir . " " How is your eye , Bobby ? " " It 's fine , sir . It 's all healed . " " I 'm happy to hear that . No , Billy 's surgery was not suc-cessful . " " I 'm awfully sorry to hear that , sir . " There was another pause . I thought I could hear Mr. Merritbreathing into the phone . " Sir ? " " Yes ? " " May I come over to visit Billy ? " " Billy is in Albany with friends of mine . My company has transferred me to Albany . We 're being moved out today . " I did n't say anything . " Goodbye , Bobby . I 'm glad your eye is all right . Be careful with your eyes . " " Yes , sir . Goodbye . " I hung up , the phone and stood still for a minute , trying to calm myself . It did n't do any good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while . I opened a book , stared at it blankly , then closed it . I kept hearing Mr. Savo saying , " Crazy world . Cockeyed . " I began to wander aimlessly through the rooms of the apartment . My hands were freezing . I went out onto the porch , sat in the lounge chair , and stared across the yard at the ailanthus . Its leaves were bathed in sunlight , and its musky odor reached me faintly in the breeze that blew against the back of the house . Something moved faintly across the edge of the field of vision of my left eye , but I ignored it and kept staring at the sunlight on the ailanthus leaves . It moved again , and I heard a faint buzzing sound . I turned my head and looked at the wooden rail of the porch . A spider had spun a web across the corner of the upper rail , and there was a housefly trapped in it now , its wings spread-eagled , glued to the strands of the web , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body arching wildly , and then it managed to get its wings free , and there was the buzzing sound again as the wings struggled to free the body to which they were attached . Then the wings were trapped againp165by the filmy , almost invisible strands of the web , and the black legs kicked at the air . I saw the spider , a small , gray , furrylookingspider , with long , wispy legs and black eyes , move across the web toward the fly . I rose from the chair and went over to the web . The fly 's tiny black legs flayed the air fiercely , then its wings were free again , buzzing noisily , but its body remainedglued fast . I bent and blew hard against the web . It swayed , but remained intact . I blew again , harder now , and the strands seemed suddenly to melt . The fly fell on its back to the wooden floor of the porch , righted itself , then flew off , buzzing loudly . The spider tumbled from the broken web , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , then swiftly climbed the strand , scrambled across the top front rail of the porch , and disappeared . I went back to the lounge chair , sat down , and continued to stare at the sunlight on the ailanthus.  |p166DANNY  AND I were together almost every day during the first month of that summer . It was a hot , humid month , with a fierce summer sun that left a heat shimmer over the streets and softened the asphalt . Manya was forever muttering about the streaks of black tar that clung to my shoes and sneakers and rubbed off on the floor of the apartment . Danny spent his mornings studying Talmud , either alone or with his father , while I spent Monday , Wednesday , and Friday mornings playing ball with my yeshiva friends , none of whom seemed to be bothered by my friendship with Danny  --  theyaccepted it and just did n't talk about it  --  and Sunday , Tuesday , and Thursday mornings studying Talmud with my father , either on our back porch when it was a nice day or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I were studyingSanhedrin  --  slowly , patiently , intensively , not leaving a passage until my father was satisfied that , at least for the present , we understood it fully . Often , we were only able to do about ten lines at a time . Danny , on the other hand , had his daily Talmud goal increased to three Blatt by his father . It did n't seem to affect him very much ; he was still able to spend all his afternoons on the third floor of the library , reading . I joined him there every afternoon , and frequently my father came with me . He was writing another article , on a passage in Avodah Zarah , which , he said , he was only now beginning to understand , and he needed one of the journal collections . So the three of us sat there in the afternoons , reading or talking quietly , until it was time for supper . Once I invited Danny to come home and eat with us , but he refusedthe invitation with a lame excuse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father told me that Danny probably did n't eat anywhere except in his own home , or inp167the home of one of his father 's followers , because of kashruth , and that it would be wise for me not to embarrass him again with another invitation . On Shabbat afternoons I would walk to Danny 's house . Danny would take me up to his father 's study , and we would all do battle again over the Talmud . Then would come the glass of tea , the Afternoon Service , the ritual of the contest  --  Danny did n't once miss finding his father 's deliberate errors  --  theEvening Service , and the Havdalah . Reb Saunders did n't talk to me again about Danny 's reading , but I knew he was bothered by it terribly . I could tell from the occasional silence that filled the study while Danny would be downstairs getting the tea . And Danny did n't talk about it , either . He just went on reading . Only the evenings were unscheduled . We sort of played them by ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon whether we would spend the evening walking , or in my house or his , or alone . Often , I went to the movies either with my father or with some of my school friends . Danny never went to the movies . They were forbiddenby his father , he said . My father and I followed the war news very carefully , and there were now many more New York Times maps on the wall of my room . From the fourth to the tenth of July there was a violent battle in the La-Haye-du-Puits area . A panzer counterattack west of the Vire was smashed on the eleventh of July , but the American drive toward St : Lo was stopped by a German parachute corps . Caen was finally captured , and then on the eighteenth of July St.-Lo fell . A war **25;9888;TOOLONG announced that the lodgment area from which the Allied Armies would soon launch their major offensiveinto the heart of occupied France was now adequate and secure . My father and I listened to the news broadcasts , read the Times , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite the many announcements of victories , the war was going very slowly . My father looked grim as he studied the war maps that showed the Allied advance between D day and the third week of July . Then the weather in France changed , and the war seemed to have come to a complete halt , swallowed by endless rain.  |p168In  the beginning of the third week of July , my father 's researchfor the article he was writing made it necessary for him to travel to the library of the Jewish Theological Seminaryin Manhattan . There were manuscripts there which he needed for the purpose of checking variant readings of the Talmudic passage on which he was working . So every day that week right after lunch he took the subway to Manhattans and I went alone to the library to be with Danny . That was the week Danny began to read Freud in German . It was difficult for him at first , and he admitted it openly . Not only was the language still a problem but also the terminologyand ideas he encountered were strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , he told me , or Minkin on Hasidism , or Hemingway , Fitzgerald , Dreiser , and Dickens . It was n't even the Ogden and Fliigel psychology books he had been reading . This was primary source material , research papers based on direct experimental data , involvedtheoretical constructions utilizing a complex vocabularyand containing a wealth of original ideas  --  and he was breaking his head on it . I listened to him talk and felt a little awed by it all . Five or so weeks ago , he had talked of the unconscious and of dreams almost as a child talks about his first tricycle . Now he was talking about direct experimental data and involved theoreticalconstructions . He spent the first part of that third week in July leafing through a collection of Freud 's writings  --  to get a taste of the material , he said  --  while I sat opposite him , trying to make my way through the first volume of Principia Mathematica and finally giving it up as too difficult and settling for a rereadingof the article my math teacher had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " Conditions Affectingthe Application of Symbolic Logic , " and I understood it a lot better this time  --  and for a book on logic by Susanne K. Langer . The first sections of the book were a little too easy for me , but the final chapter on logistics , in which she showed how Principia Mathematica provides a basis from which the concepts , operations , and relations of arithmetic and other branches of mathematics may be derived , I found to be very exciting . By Thursday , Danny 's side of the table was piled high withp169books , and he was looking thoroughly unhappy . He was sitting there , twisting an earlock and biting his lower lip , his face a mask of frustration . It was impossible , he said finally . The whole thing was ridiculous and impossible ; he was n't gettinganywhere . It was n't so much the German itself anymore as the technical terminology . He was n't making any headway at all . Not only that , but he had begun to use English translationsof the German works he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more . He showed me where in one translation the German word " Unlust " had been translatedas " pain , " in quotations marks , and the word " Schmerz " had been translated as " pain , " without quotation marks . How was he supposed to know what the translator had had in mind when he had used " pain " with and " pain " without quotationmarks ? And look at the word " Besetzung , " he said angrily . What did it mean to translate it as " investment " or " charge " ? And what good did it do to translate it as " cathexis " ? What did " cathexis " mean ? " Angst " was " anxiety , " " Furcht " was " fear , " " Schreck " was " fright . " How was he supposed to know what the difference between " fear " and " fright " was ? He was n't getting anywhere , he would probably have to drop the whole thing ; who did he think he was anywaytrying to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry and disgusted , his face a picture of bewildered frustration . When I got to Danny 's house that Shabbat afternoon , I found him in an ugly mood . He was waiting for me outside . He greeted me with a curt nod of his head and muttered something about not really being in the mood for Talmud now but we had to go up anyway . He was very quiet during the first few minutes of the Talmud battle , and though I tried to make up for his silence by increasing the volume of myown enthusiasm , I could see that Reb Saunders was becoming more and more annoyed by his son 's lack of participation . Danny was tense and edgy , his face still masked by frustration , his mind obviously not on what we were discussing . He 's probably eating himself up alive over Freud , I thought , hoping his father would n't lose his temper . But Reb Saunders remained patient and left his son alone . In the middle of a heated debate over an impossible passagein Kiddushin I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been punched in the stomach . Reb Saunders and I broke off our discussion and looked at him . He was staring down at the Talmud , and smiling . His face had come to life , and there was a light in his eyes . He jumped up from his chair , circled the room , then sat down again , and Reb Saundersand I just sat there , staring at him . Something is the matter ? Reb Saunders wanted to know . There is a joke in the Talmud we did not see ? What was so funny ? Danny shook his head , still smiling , bent over the Talmud , and began to give his version of the passage . His voice trembled a little . There was a pause when he finished , and I thought for a mo ment that Reb Saunders would again ask his son what had been so funny . Instead , I heard him sigh a little , then offer a brief passage from Baba Bathra that contradicted Danny 's explanation . We returned to the battle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was quiet as he walked me part of the way home that night , and when we got to the synagogue where my father and I prayed he muttered something about seeing me in the library the next day , then turned and went quickly back . When I got to the library the next afternoon , I found him seated at his table . There were three books open in front of him . He smiled broadly and waved me to a chair . He had worked out a method of doing Freud , he said , and seemed to be going all right , so far . He pointed to the three books . One was a volume of Freud 's early papers , he told me . Some of them Freud had written together with Josef Breuer , a Viennesephysician ; others he had written alone . Another was the Cassell 's German-English Dictionary . The third was a dictionary of psychological terms edited by someone called Warren . The Freud volume was open to a paper entitled " Ein Fall Von Hypnotischer Heilung . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rest of the title I could figure out for myself from my Yiddish , he told me . " I forgot what it was like to study Talmud , " he said excitedly . " Talmud is so easy for me now , I did n't remember what I used to go through when I first started it as a kid . Can you study Talmud without the commentaries ? Imagine Talmud without Rashi . How far would you get ? " I agreed with him that I would n't get very far at all . He had been going at it all wrong , he said , his eyes brightp171with excitement . He had wanted to read Freud . That had been his mistake . Freud had to be studied , not read . He had to be studied like a page of Talmud . And he had to be studiedwith a commentary . But Danny did n't know of any commentaries on Freud , so he had settled for the next best thing . He had needed something that would explain Freud 's technical terminology , that would clarify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he had found this dictionary of psychologicalterms . He was reading Freud now sentence by sentence . He did n't go on to the next sentence until the prior sentence was perfectly clear in his mind . If he came across a German word he did not know , he looked up its English meaning in the Cassell 's . If the Cassell 's gave him a translation he did n't understand , one that would n't fit the meaning of the sentence , he looked the English word up in the psychology dictionary . That psychological dictionary was his commentary . It had , for example , already explained to him the technical difference between " fear " and " fright . " It had also explained the term " cathexis . " It was working . He had already studied two and a half pages that afternoon . Was Freud worth all that effort ? I wanted to know . Freud was a genius , Danny told me . Of course he was worth all that effort . Was symbolic logic worth all my effort ? I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was probably right . So I continued reading the Langer book , while Danny bent over the table studying Freud . He shuffled pages impatientlywhenever he had to look something up in one of his dictionaries . The sounds of the shuffling pages were loud in the silence of the library . On Thursday , I told him that my father and I would be leaving next Tuesday morning for the cottage near Peekskill where we always stayed in August , and I gave him two books I thought he might like to read . One was The Making of the Modern Jew by Milton Steinberg , the other was The NineteenLetters of Ben Uzziel by Samson Raphael Hirsch . He thanked me and said he would read them . When my father and I left for Peekskill on Tuesday morning , Danny had completed the first paper and was started on the second , entitled " Die Abwehr-Neuropsychosen . " We had agreed not top172write to each other -- probably out of an unspoken feeling that two boys our age writing one another when we were only going to be separated for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see him again until after Labor Day . My father and I returned home the day after Labor Day , and I called Danny immediately . His mother answered and told me she was delighted I had had a good vacation but she was sorry , Danny was n't home , he had gone with his father to visit a family friend in Lakewood . Danny called me later that evening , happy to hear I was back . He had missed me , he said . How was the trip to Lakewood ? I wanted to know . Miserable , he said . Had I ever sat in a bus with my father for hours and not exchanged a single word of conversation , except for a short discussion about a passage of Talmud ? No , I told him quietly , I had never had that kind of experience . I always talked to my father . I was lucky , he said . I did n't know how really lucky I was , he added , a little bitterly . We chatted for a while , and agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found him at his table , looking a little pale , but happy . His tufts of beard had grown a bit thicker , he blinked his eyes a little too often , as if weary from all his reading , but otherwise he was the same , everything was the same , and it was as though we had not seen each other for , at most , a single night of dream-filled sleep . Yes , he had read the two books I had given him . They had been very good , and he had learned a lot from them about the problems of contemporary Judaism . His father had thrown some poisonous looks at him when he had taken them into the house , but the looks had disappeared when Danny had somehow gotten up the courage to tell him that the books had come from Leuven Malter . He would give them back to me tomorrow . He had also read a great deal of Freud , he said . He had finished almost all of the first volume , and he wanted to talk to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in der Atiologie der Neurosen . " It had been something of a shock to him to read that , he said , and he had no one else to talk to about it except me , he did n't want to discuss it with my father . I said fine , we could talk about it on Shabbat when I came over to his house . But somehow we never got around to talking about it thatp173Shabbat , and on Sunday morning we were both back in school again . The year  --  the real year of a person going to school  --  began , and for a long while I had no time at all to think about , let alone discuss , the writings of Sigmund Freud.  |p174FOR  THE FIRST TWO MONTHS of that school year , Danny and I were able to get together regularly only on Shabbat afternoons . Only once did we manage to see each other during the week . I had been elected president of my class , and I found myself suddenly involved in student politics . The evenings that I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee meetings . We talked frequently by phone , though , and neither of us felt our friendship was sufferingany . But we never got around to discussing what he was reading in Freud . During November , I managed to go over to his house one evening in the middle of the week . I brought him a half a dozen books on Jewish subjects that my father had suggested he read , and he thanked me for them gratefully . He looked a little weary , but otherwise he was fine  --  except for his eyes , which tired easily , he said . He had been to a doctor , but he did n't need glasses , so everything was really all right . I asked him how he was coming along with Freud , and he said , lookinguncomfortable , that he was rarely in the library these days , there was too much schoolwork , but he did manage to read a little of Freud now and then , and it had become very upsetting . " One of these days I want to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , blinking his eyes . But we had no real opportunity for , any long talk . The Shabbat day grew shorter and shorter , my schoolwork seemed endless , and student politics took up every moment of my spare time . And then , in the middle of December , just when it seemed that the war would be over very soon , the Germans launched a major offensive in the Ardennes region , and the tattle ofp175the Bulge began . There were reports of frightful American casualties  --  some newspaper said that two thousand American soldiers were being killed and wounded every day . It was a cold , bitter winter in New York , bleak with the news of the fighting in the Ardennes , and at night , as I sat working at my desk , I could hear the radio in the kitchen where my father would be sitting with his war maps , following the news . The Battle of the Bulge ended about the middle of January , with the newspapers reporting seventy-seven thousand Allied casualties and one hundred twenty thousand German casualties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid dle of December to the middle of January  --  I did not see Danny once . We spoke on the phone a few times ; he told me his brother was sick again and might have to spend some time in a hospital . But the next time I called him his brother was all right  --  the doctor had changed his pills , Danny said , and that seemed to work . He sounded tired and sad , and once or twice I could barely hear his voice over the phone . The Battle of the Bulge ? Yes , he said vaguely , a terrible business . When was I coming over to see him ? As soon as I could breathe a little , I said . He said not to wait too long , he needed to talk to me . Was it very important ? I wanted to know . No , it could wait , it was n't very important , he said , sounding sad . So it waited . It waited through my midyear exams and through the first two weeks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house twice and we fought our customary Talmudbattles together with his father but did n't get a chance to be alone long enough for us to talk . And then the news of the war in Europe suddenly reached a peak of feverish excitement . The Russians captured KOnigsberg and Breslau and came within thirty miles of Berlin , and at the end of the first week in March American troops reached the Rhine River at Remagen and discovered , to their astonishment , that the LudendorffBridge had , for some reason , not been destroyed by the Germans . My father almost wept with joy when we heard the news . There had been talk of bloody battles and high casualtiesin crossing the Rhine . Instead , American troops poured across the bridge , the Remagen beachhead wasp176quickly enlarged and held against German counterattacks and everyone began to talk of the war ending in two months . My father and I were overjoyed , and even Danny , whom I saw again in the middle of March and who generally took little interest in the details of the war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hitler , may his name and memory be erased , " Reb Saunders said to me that Shabbat afternoon . " Master of the Universe , it has taken so long , but now the end is here . " And he trembled as he said it and was almost in tears . Danny caught the flu in the last week of March and was in bed for more than a week . During that time , the Saar and Silesia were taken , the Ruhr was encircled by American troops , and another bridgehead was formed across the Rhine by soldiers of General Patton 's army . Almost every day now there were rumors that the war had ended . But each rumor proved to be false and did nothing but add to the already intolerableanxiety and suspense my father and I were feeling as we read the papers and listened to the radio . Danny returned to school at the end of the first week in April , apparently too soon , for he was back in bed two days later with bronchitis . I called his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , no , he was too sick , and besides what he had was contagious , even his brother and sister were n't permittedinto his room . I asked if I could speak to him , but she told me he was running a high fever and could not could not leave his bed to come to the phone . She sounded worried . He was coughing a great deal , she told me , and was exhausted from the sulfa he was taking . Yes , she would give him my wishes for his speedy recovery . On the Thursday afternoon of the second week in April , I was sitting at a meeting of the student council . The meeting had started pleasantly enough with the usual reading of the minutes and committee reports , when Davey Cantor burst into the room , looking as though he was crying , and shouted breathlessly that someone had just told him President Rooseveltwas dead . He was standing by the open door of the classroom , and there was a sudden movement of heads as everyone turned and gaped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sentence , and I turned , too , remaining on my feet next to my desk , and I heard myself saying angrily that he had a hell of a nerve barging in here like that , he was n't being one bit funny . " It 's true ! " he shouted , crying . " Mr. Weinberg just told me ! He heard it on the radio in the faculty room ! " I stared at him and felt myself slide slowly back onto my desk . Mr. Weinberg taught English . He was a short , bald man , with no sense of humor , and his motto was " Believe nothing of what you hear and only half of what you see . " If Mr. Weinberg had told Davey Cantor that President Rooseveltwas dead .. . I found myself in a sudden cold sweat . Someone in the room giggled , someone else moaned , " Oh , no ! " and our facultyadvisor stood up and suggested that the meeting be adjourned . We left the building and came out onto the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't believe it . I could n't believe it . It was like God dying . Davey Cantor had said something about a cerebral hemorrhage . I did n't believe it . Until I got to the street . It was a little after five o'clock , and there was still sunlight . The late afternoon traffic was heavy . Trucks , cars and a trolleychoked the street , waiting for the corner light to change . I crossed quickly , ran for the trolley , and made it just as the light changed . I found a seat next to a middle-aged lady who sat staring straight ahead , weeping silently . I looked around . No one in the trolley was talking . It was crowded , and it becamemore crowded as it went along , but there was only the silence inside . I saw one man put his hands over his eyes and just sit there like that for a while . I stared out the window . People stood around in small groups on the sidewalks . They did n't seem to be talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal herd bunching up for protection . An old grayhairedwoman , walking with a child , held a handkerchief to her mouth . I saw the child look up at her and say something , but I could n't hear it . I found myself crying too , and felt a gnawing emptiness , as though I had been scraped clean inside and there was nothing in me now but a terrible darkness . I was feeling as though it had been my father who had died . The whole ride home was like that : silence in the trolleyp178car , weeping men and women , groups of people standing about dazedly in the streets , little children looking bewildered and wondering what had happened . Manya and my father were home . I heard the radio in the kitchen as I opened the door , quickly put my books in my room , and joined them . Manya was cooking supper , and sobbing . My father was sitting at the table , his face ashen , his cheeks hollow , his eyes red , looking as he had when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the table and listened to the news announcer . He was talking in a hushed voice and giving details of President Roosevelt 's death . Harry S Truman was now President of the United States . I sat there and listened and could n't believe it . How could President Roosevelt die ? I had never even thought of him as being mortal . And to die now , especially now , when the war was almost over , when there was to be a meeting soon of the new United Nations . How could a man like that die ? We ate our supper listening to the radio  --  something we had never done before ; my father never liked to have the radio on during a meal . But it was on during that meal and every other meal we ate that entire weekend  --  except for the Shabbat  --  andit stayed on every moment either my father or Manya or I was home . I tried calling Danny on Friday afternoon , but he was still too sick to come to the phone . My father and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain of death showed itself clearly on every face , and where my friends and I just stood around aimlessly after the service , not knowing what to say . My father began to cough again , the deep , dry , racking cough that shook his frail body and frightened me terribly . On Shabbat afternoon , he talked of President Roosevelt , of the hope he had brought to the country during the Depression . " You do not remember the Depression , Reuven , " he told me . " Those were terrible days , black days . It is impossible to believe he is gone . It is like when  --  " His voice broke , and he was suddenly sobbing . I stared at him , feeling helpless and terrified . He went into his bedroom and stayed there the rest of the afternoon , and I lay on my bed , staring up at the ceiling , my hands clasped behind my head , trying to grasp what had happened . I could n't . I saw only emptiness and fear andp179a kind of sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I lay on my bed and thought about it a long time . It was senseless , as  --  I held my breath , feeling myself shiver with fear  --  as Billy 's blindness was senseless . That was it . It was as senseless , as empty of meaning , as Billy 's blindness . I lay there and thought of Roosevelt being dead and Billy being blind , and finally I turned over and lay with my face on the pillow and felt myself crying . I cried a long time . Then I slept fitfully . When I woke , the room was dark , and I heard the radio going again in the kitchen . I lay on the bed a while , then joined my father . We sat together in the kitchen . It was after midnight when we went to sleep . The next day , President Roosevelt was buried . Our school was closed for the funeral , and my father and I sat in the kitchen all that day and listened to the radio . Danny called me a few hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coughed a good deal . But his temperaturewas down to normal , he said , and had been normal for twenty-four hours now . Yes , Roosevelt 's death was a terrible thing , he said . His parents were all right . His brother was sick , though . He was running a high fever , and coughing . Could I come over during the week ? he asked me . I did n't think so . Could I come over on Saturday , then ? Yes , I could . I would see him on Shabbat , I said . He sounded relieved when we hung up , and I wondered what was happening . But on Wednesday I came home from school with a fever , and by Thursday afternoon I was running 103.6 . The doctor called it the flu and warned my father to keep me in bed or there might be complications . I asked my father to call Danny and tell him . I was in bed for ten days , and when I finally got back to school I found I had missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my student council activities and spent every moment I had catching up . I used Shabbat afternoons for reading , and by the first week of May I had caught up enough to be able to begin attending student councilmeetings again . Then Reb Saunders became ill , and at the same time my father also took to his bed with the flu , a severecase that bordered on pneumonia for a while and frightened me terribly . Both Reb Saunders and my father were quite ill on the day in May when word finally came that the war in Europe was over.  |p180I  was with my father when we heard the news over the radio in his bedroom . " Thank God ! " my father said , his eyes wet with joy . " What a price to have paid for Hitler and his madmen ! " And he lay back on the pillow and closed his eyes . And then , together with the official report of the signing of the unconditional surrender on May 7 , there came the news , at first somewhat guarded , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German concentration camps . My father , recuperatingslowly and looking worn and weary , sat in his bed propped on pillows , and read the newspaper stories of the horrors that had occurred in those camps . His face was grim and ashen . He seemed unable to believe what he was reading . It was while my father read to me an account of what had happened at Teresienstadt , where the Germans had imprisonedand murdered European Jews of culture and learning , that I saw him break down and weep like a child . I did n't know what to say . I saw him lie back on his pillowsand cover his face with his hands . Then he asked me to leave him alone , and I walked out and left him there , crying , and went to my room . I just could n't grasp it . The numbers of Jews slaughtered had gone from one million to three million to four million , and almost every article we read said that the last count was still incomplete , the final number would probably reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million of my people murdered . I lay in my bed and asked myself what sense it made . It did n't make any sense at all . My mind could n't hold on to it , to the death of six million people . Danny called me a few days later , and I went over to his house the next Shabbat afternoon . We did not study Talmud . Instead , his father talked of the Jewish world in Europe , of the people he had known who were now probably dead , of the brutality of the world , of his years in Russia with the Cossack bands looting and plundering . " The world kills us , " he said quietly . " Ala , how the world kills us . " We were sitting in his study , and he was in his straightbackedchair . His face was lined with suffering . His body swayed slowly back and forth , and he talked in a quiet singsong , calling up the memories of his youth in Russia and tell/ing us of the Jewish communities of Poland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all gone now into heaps of bones and ashes . Danny and I sat silent and listened to him talk . Danny was pale and seemed tense and distraught . He tugged constantly at an earlock , his eyes blinking nervously . " How the world drinks our blood , " Reb Saunders said . " How the world makes us suffer . It is the will of God . We must accept the will of God . " He was silent for a long moment . Then he raised his eyes and said softly . " Master of the Universe , how do you permit such a thing to happen ? " The question hung in the air like a sigh of pain . Danny could not walk me back that night , he had too much schoolwork to do , so I went home alone and found my father in his bedroom , listening to the radio . He was in pajamas , and he wore his small black skullcap . The announcer was talking about the United Nations . I at in a chair and listened , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radio and looked at me . " How is Reb Saunders ? " he asked quietly . I told him what Reb Saunders had talked about that afternoon . My father nodded slowly . He was pale and gaunt , and his skin had a yellowish tint to it and was parchmentlike on his face and hands . " Reb Saunders wanted to know how God could let something like his happen , " I told him quietly . My father looked at me , his eyes somber . " And did God answer him ? " he asked . His voice had a strange quality of bitterness to it . I did n't say anything . " Did God answer him , Reuven ? " my father asked again , that same bitterness in his voice . " Reb Saunders said it was God 's will . We have to accept God 's will , he said . " My father blinked his eyes . " Reb Saunders said it was God 's will , " he echoed softly . I nodded . " You are satisfied with that answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes again , and when he spoke his voice was soft , the bitterness gone . " I am not satisfied with it , ei/ther , Reuven . We can not wait for God . If there is an answer , we must make it ourselves . " I was quiet . " Six million of our people have been slaughtered , " he went on quietly . " It is inconceivable . It will have meaning only if we give it meaning . We can not wait for God . " He lay back on the pillows . " There is only one Jewry left now in the world , " he said softly , staring up at the ceiling . " It is here , in America . We have a terrible responsibility . We must replace the treasures we have lost . " His voice was hoarse , and he coughed . Then he was quiet for a long time . I saw him close his eyes , and I heard him say , " Now we will need teachers and rabbis to lead our people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Jewish world is changed , " he said , almost in a whisper . " A madman has destroyed our treasures . If we do not rebuild Jewry in America , we will die as a people . " Then he closed his eyes again and was silent . My father recovered slowly , and it was only at the end of May that he was able to return to his teaching . Two days after I took my final examination , he suffered a heart attack . He was rushed by ambulance to the Brooklyn Memorial Hospital and put into a semiprivate room one floor below the eye ward . Manya took care of me during the first nightmarish days of blind panic when my mind collapsed and would not function . Then Reb Saunders called me one night and invited me to live in his house while my father recovered . How could I live alone with only a housekeeper to care for me ? he wanted to know . Why should I stay alone in the apartment at night ? Who knew , God forbid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my age to be left alone . They could put another bed in Danny 's room , and I could sleep there . When I told my father , he said it would be wise for me to accept the offer . And he told me to tell Reb Saunders how grateful he was to him for his kindness . On the first day of July I packed a bag and took a cab to Reb Saunders ' house . I moved into Danny 's room.  |p183FROM  THE DAY I entered Reb Saunders ' house to the day I left to go with my father to our cottage near Peekskill where he was to convalesce , I was a warmly accepted member of Danny 's family . Danny 's mother , who had some kind of heart condition and needed to rest frequently , was forever adding food to my plate . Danny 's sister , I noticed for the first time , was a very pretty girl , with dark eyes and long dark hair combed back into a single braid , and vivacious hands that seemed always in motion when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referring to us as David and Jonathan . Danny 's brother , Levi , was forever poking at his food when he sat at the kitchen table , or walking ghostlike around the house , picking his nose . And Danny 's father was forever silent , withdrawn , his dark eyes turned inward , brooding , as if witnessing a sea of suffering he alone could see . He walked bent forward , as though there were some kind of enormous burden on his shoulders . Dark circles had formed around his eyes , and sometimes at the kitchen table I would see him begin to cry suddenly , and he would get up and walk out of the room , then return a few minutes later and resume eating . No one in the family talked about these sudden moments of weeping . And I did n't either , though they frightened and bewildered me . Danny and I did everything together that month . We would rise a little before seven , go down to the synagogue to pray the Morning Service with the congregation , have breakfast with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day was nice , or stay in his room if it was n't , and spend the morning studying Talmud . After lunch , we would go together to the library , where we would spend the early hours of the afternoon . Danny was reading Freud , and I was doing sym/ti bolic logic . It was in the library that we did all the talking we had been unable to do during the year . Then , at about four o'clock , we would take the trolley together to the Brooklyn Memorial Hospital and visit my father . We would have suppertogether with Danny 's family , then spend the evening eitherchatting with his sister and mother in the living room or reading quietly  --  Danny used the evenings to read the books on Jewish subjects I kept giving him  --  or , if his father was free , we would go up to the study and do battle over the Talmud . But Reb Saunders was rarely free . There seemed to bean endless number of people coming into the house and walkingup the three flights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ready for supper he was always visibly fatigued , and he would sit lost in thought , his eyes dark and brooding . And once , during a supper meal , I saw tears come slowly from hiseyes and disappear into the tangle of the dark beard . He did not leave the table this time . He sat there , weeping in silence , and no one said anything . And then he dried his eyes with ahandkerchief , took a deep , trembling breath , and went back tohis food . During the entire month I spent in Reb Saunders ' house , the only time I ever saw him talk to Danny was when we argued over the Talmud . There was never any simple , intimate , human kind of conversation between him and his son . I almost had the impression that they were physically incapable of communicating with each other about ordinary things . It troubled me , but I said nothing about it . Danny and I talked often about his reading of Freud . We sat at our table in the third floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he told me what he had read duringthe past year and what he was reading now . Freud had clearly upset him in a fundamental kind of way  --  had thrown him off balance , as he once put it . But he could n't stop readinghim , he said , because it had become increasingly obvious to him that Freud had possessed an almost uncanny insight into the nature of man . And that was what Danny found upsetting . Freud 's picture of man 's nature was anything but complimentary , it was anything but religious . It tore man from God , as Danny put it , and married him off to Satan . Danny knew enough about Freud now  --  his method of study had been so thoroughly successful  --  that he was able top185use Freud 's technical terminology with the same kind ofd , ural ease that characterized our use of the technical terminologyof the Talmud . For the first two weeks of July , Danny spent part of our reading time in the library patiently explaining to me some of Freud 's basic concepts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit  --  he wore a dark suit no matter how hot it was  --  his tieless shirt , his fringes , his skullcap , his long earlocks , and his beard , which was thick and full now , almost an adult beard , and me in my sport shirt , summer trousers , and skullcap , and we talked about Sigmund Freud . What I heard was new , so new that I could n't grasp it at first . But Danny was patient , as patient as my father , and slowly I began to understand the system of psychological thought Freud had constructed . And I , too , became upset . Freud contradictedeverything I had ever learned . What I found particularlyupsetting was the fact that Danny did n't seem to have rejected what Freud taught . I began to wonder how it was possible for the ideas of the Talmud and the thinking of Freud to live side by side within one person . It seemed to me that one or the other would have to give way . When I told this to Danny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reading . Had my father been well at that time , I would have talked to him about it , but he was in the hospital , recuperating slowly , and I did n't want to upset him with an account of Danny 's reading . He was upset enough as it was with his own reading . Whenever Danny and I came to visit him , we found newspapers strewn all over his bed . He was reading everything he could find that told of the destruction of European Jewry . He talked of nothing else but European Jewry and the responsibility American Jews now carried . Occasionally he spoke of the importance of Palestine as a Jewish homeland , but mostly he was concerned about American Jewry and the need for teachers and rabbis . Once he asked Danny and me what we were reading these days , and Danny answered honestlythat he was going through Freud . My father sat in his hospital bed , propped up on pillows , looked at him , and blinked . He had grown very thin  --  I had n't thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart attack , but it seemed to me he had lost at least ten pounds  --  and hep186seemed to become easily upset by little things . I was frightenedfor a moment , because I did n't want him to get involved in an argument with Danny about Freud . But he only shook his head and sighed . He was very tired , he said ; he would talk to Danny about Freud another time . Danny should n't think that Freud was the final word in psychoanalysis ; many great thinkers disagreed with him . He let it go at that , and went back to talking about the destruction of European Jewry . Did we know , he asked us , that on December 17 , 1942 , Mr. Eden got up in the House of Commons and gave the complete details of the Nazi plan , already in full operation , to massacre the entire Jewish population of Europe ? Did we know that Mr. Eden , though he had threatened the Nazis with retribution , had n't said a word about practical measures to save as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their inevitable fate ? There had been public meetings in England , protests , petitions , letters  --  the whole machinery of democratic expression had been set in motion to impress upon the British Government the need for action  --  and not a thing was done . Everyone was sympathetic , but no one was sympathetic enough . The British let some few Jews in , and then closed their doors . America had n't cared enough , either . No one had cared enough . The world closed its doors , and six million Jews were slaughtered . What a world ! What an insane world ! " What do we have left to us now , if not American Jewry ? " he said . " Some Jews say we should wait for God to send the Messiah . We can not wait for God ! We must make our own Messiah ! We must rebuild American Jewry ! And Palestine must become a Jewish homeland ! We have suffered enough ! How long must we wait for the Messiah ? " It was bad for my father to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do to stop him . He could talk of nothing else but the destruction of European Jewry . One morning at breakfast Reb Saunders came out of a brooding silence , sighed , and for no apparent reason began telling us , in a soft , singsong chant , the story of an old , pious Hasid who had set out on a journey to Palestine  --  Eretz Yisroel , Reb Saunders called it , giving the land its traditional name and accenting the " E " and the " ro "  --  so as to be able to spend the last years of his life in the Holy Land . Finally ,  |p187he  reached the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem , and three days later he died while praying at the Wall for the Messiah to come and redeem his people . Reb Saunders swayed slowly hack and forth as he told the story , and when he was done I said quietly , not mentioning my father 's name , that a lot of people were now saying that it was time for Palestine to becomea Jewish homeland and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reaction on the part of the entire familywas instantaneous ; it was as though someone had thrown a match onto a pile of straw . I could almost feel the heat that replaced the family warmth around the table . Danny went rigid and stared down at the plate in front of him . His brother let out a little whimper , and his sister and mother seemed frozen to their chairs . Reb Saunders stared at me , his eyes suddenly wild with rage , his beard trembling . And he pointed a finger at me that looked like a weapon . " Who are these people ? Who are these people ? " he shouted in Yiddish , and the words went through me like knives . " Apikorsim ! Goyim ! Ben Gurion and his goyim will build Eretz Yisroel ? They will build for us a Jewish land ? They will bring Torah into this land ? Goyishkeit they will bring into the land , not Torah ! God will build the land , not Ben Gurion and his goyim ! When the Messiah comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not a land contaminated by Jewish goyim ! " I sat there stunned and terrified , engulfed by his rage . His reaction had caught me so completely by surprise that I had quite literally stopped breathing , and now I found myself gasping for breath . I felt as if I were being consumed by flames . The silence that followed his outburst had a fungus quality to it , as though it were breeding malignancies , and I had the uncanny feeling that I had somehow been stripped naked and violated . I did n't know what to do or say . I just sat there and gaped at him . " The land of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob should be built by Jewish goyim , by contaminated men ? " Reb Saunders shouted again . " Never ! Not while I live ! Who says these things ? Who says we should now build Eretz Yisroel ? And where is the Messiah ? Tell me , we should forget completely about the Messiah ? For this six million of our people were slaughtered ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should forget completely about the x+ aster of the Universe ?  |p188Why  do you think I brought my people from Russia to America and not to Eretz Yisroel ? Because it is better to live in a land of true goyim than to live in a land of Jewish goyim ! Who says we should build Eretz Yisroel , ah ? I 'll tell you who says it ! Apikorsim say it ! Jewish goyim say it ! True Jews do not say such a thing ! " There was a long silence . Reb Saunders sat in his chair , breathing hard and trembling with rage . " Please , you should not get so angry , " Danny 's sister pleaded softly . " It is bad for you . " " I 'm sorry , " I said lamely , not knowing what else to say . " Reuven was not talking for himself , " Danny 's sister said quietly to her father . " He was only  --  " iBut Reb Saunders cut her off with an angry wave of his hand . He went rigidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rage visibly . Danny 's sister stared down at the table , her eyes dark and sad . Later , when Danny and I were alone in his room , Danny told me to think ten thousand times the next time I wanted to mention anything like that again to his father . His father was fine , he said , until he was confronted by any idea that he felt came from the contaminated world . " How was I supposed to know that Zionism is a contaminatedidea ? " I said . " My God , I feel as if I 've just been through the seven gates of Hell . " " Herzl did n't wear a caftan and side curls , " Danny said . " Neither does Ben Gurion . " " You ca n't be serious . " " I 'm not talking about myself . I 'm talking about my father . Just do n't talk about a Jewish state anymore . My father takes God and Torah very seriously , Reuven . He would die for them both quite gladly . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrilege , a violation of the Torah . You touched a raw nerve . Please do n't do it again . " " I 'm glad I did n't mention it was my father who said it . He might have thrown me out of the house . " " He would have thrown you out of the house , " Danny said grimly . " Is he  --  is he feeling all right ? " " How do you mean ? "  | " The way he cries all the time like that . Is he  --  is something wrong ? " Danny 's hand went slowly to an earlock , and I watched him tug at it nervously . " Six million Jews have died , " he said . " He 's  --  I think he 's thinking of them . He 's suffering for them . " I looked at him . " I thought he might be sick . I thought your sister said  --  " " He 's not sick , " Danny broke in . He lowered his hand . " I  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right , " I said quietly . " But I do n't think I want to study any Talmud this morning . I 'm going to take a long walk . " He did n't say anything . But his face was sad and brooding as I went out of his room . When I saw Reb Saunders again at lunch , he seemed to have forgotten the incident completely . But I found myself thinking carefully now before I said anything to him . And I was constantly on my guard with him from that time on . During an afternoon in the last week of July , Danny began talking about his brother . We were sitting in the library , reading , when he suddenly looked up , rested his head in the palm of his right hand , the elbow on the table , and said his eyes were bothering him again and that he would n't be at all surprised if he ended up wearing glasses soon , his brother was having glasses made and he was only nine . I told him his brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he need glasses for . " It has nothing to do with reading , " Danny said . " His eyes are just plain bad , that 's all . " " Your eyes look bloodshot , " I told him . " They are bloodshot , " he said . " Your eyes look as if you 've been reading Freud . " " Ha-ha , " Danny said . " What does Freud say about an ordinary thing like bloodshot eyes ? " " He says to rest them . " " A genius , " I said . " You know , my brother 's a good kid , " Danny said . " His sickness is quite a handicap , but everything considered he 's a good kid . "  | " He 's quiet , I 'll say that for him . Does he study at all ? " " Oh , sure . He 's bright , too . But he has to be careful . My father ca n't pressure him . " " Lucky boy . " " I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd much rather be pressured . He 's a nice kid , though . " " Your sister 's pretty nice , too , " I said . Danny did n't seem to have heard me  --  or if he had , he chose to ignore my words completely . He went on talking about his brother . " It must really be hell to walk around sick all the time and have to depend upon pills . He 's really a sweet kid . And bright , too . " He seemed to be rambling , and I was n't quite sure I knew what he was trying to say . His next words jarred me . " He 'd probably make a fine tzaddik , " he said . I looked at him . " How 's that again ? " " I said my brother would probably make a fine tzaddik , " Danny said quietly . " It occurred to me recently that if I did n't take my father 's place I would n't be breaking the dynastyafter all . My brother could take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't take his place I would break the dynasty . I think I had to justify to myself having to becomea tzaddik . " I was frightened and said tightly , " Your home has n't blownup recently , so I take it you have n't told your father . " " No , I have n't . And I 'm not going to , either . Not yet . " " When will you tell him ? Because I 'm going to be out oftown that day . " " No , " he said quietly . " Tin going to need you around that day . " " I was only kidding , " I told him , feeling sick with dread . " It also occurred to me recently that all my concern about my brother 's health was a fake . I do n't have much of a relationship with him at all . He 's such a kid . I pity him a little , that 's all . I was really concerned about his health because all along I 've wanted him to be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all right , when I realized that . How am I doing ? Are you bored yet ? " " I 'm bored stiff , " I said . " I ca n't wait until the day you tell your father . " " You 'll wait , " Danny said tightly , blinking his eyes . " You'llp191wait , and you 'll be around , too , because I 'm going to need you. , , " Let 's talk about your sister for a change , " I said . " I heard you the first time . Let 's not talk about my sister , if you do n't mind . Let 's talk about my father . You want to know how I feel about my father ? I admire him . I do n't know what he 's trying to do to me with this weird silence that he 's established between us , but I admire him . I think he 's a great man . I respect him and trust him completely , which is why I think I can live with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I do . And I pity him , too . Intellectually , he 's trapped . He was born trapped . I do n't ever want to be trapped the way he 's trapped . I want to be able to breathe , to think what I want to think , to say the things I want to say . I 'm trapped now , too , Do you know what it 's like to be trapped ? " I shook my head slowly . " How could you possibly know ? " Danny said . " It 's the most hellish , choking , constricting feeling in the world . I scream with every bone in my body to get out of it . My mind cries to get out of it . But I ca n't . Not now . One day I will , though . I 'll want you around on that day , friend . I 'll need you around on that day . " I did n't say anything . We sat in silence a long time . Then Danny slowly closed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been promised , " he told me quietly . " What ? " " My father promised my sister to the son of one of his followerswhen she was two years old . It 's an old Hasidic customto promise children away . She 'll be married when she reaches eighteen . I think we ought to go over and visit your father now . " That was the only time Danny and I ever talked about his sister . A week later , I went up with my father to our cottage near Peekskill . While we were there , America destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki with atomic bombs , and the war with Japan came to an end . I did n't tell my father about that last conversation I had with Danny , and I had many nightmares that year in whichp192Reb Saunders screamed at me that I had poisoned his son 's mind . That September Danny and I entered Hirsch College . I had grown to five feet nine inches , an inch shorter than Danny , and I was shaving . Danny had n't changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only thing different about him was that he was now wearing glasses.  |p195BY  THE END of our first week in college , Danny was feeling thoroughly miserable . He had discovered that psychology in the Samson Raphael Hirsch Seminary and College meant experimental psychology only , and that the chairman of the department , Professor Nathan Appleman , had an intense distaste for psychoanalysis in general and for Freud in particular . Danny was quite vocal about his feelings toward Professor Appleman and experimental psychology . We would meet in the mornings in front of my synagogue and walk from there to the trolley , and for two months he did nothing during those morning trolley rides except talk about the psychology textbook he was reading  --  he did n't say " studying , " he said " reading "  --  and the rats and mazes in the psychology laboratory . " The next thing you know they 'll stick me with a behaviorist , " he lamented . " What do rats and mazes have to do with the mind ? " I was n't sure I knew what a behaviorist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more miserable by asking him . I felt a littiesorry for him , mostly because I had found college to be exciting and was thoroughly enjoying my books and my teachers , while he seemed to be going deeper and deeper into misery . The building that housed the college stood on Bedford Avenue . It was a six-story whitestone building , and it occupiedhalf a block of a busy store-filled street . The noise of the traffic on the street came clearly through the windows and into our classrooms . Behind the college was a massive brownstonearmory , and a block away , across the street , was a Catholic church with a huge cross on its lawn upon which was the crucified figure of Jesus . In the evenings , a greenp196spotlight shone upon the cross , and we could see it clearly from the stone stairs in front of the college . The street floor of the building consisted of administrative offices , an auditorium , and a large synagogue , a section of which contained chairs and long tables . The entire second floor was a library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me of the third floor of the library in which Danny and I had spent so much time together . It had bright fluorescent lights  --  that did n't flicker or change color , I noticedimmediately the first time I walked in  --  and a trained , professional library staff . It also contained a large reading room , with long tables , chairs , a superb collection of referencebooks , and an oil painting of Samson Raphael Hirsch which was prominently displayed on a white wall  --  Hirsch had been a well-known Orthodox rabbi in Germany during the last century and had fought intelligently through his writingsand preachings against the Jewish Reform movement of his day . The third and fourth floors had white-painted , modernclassrooms and large , well-equipped chemistry , physics and biology laboratories . There were also classrooms on the fifth floor , as well as a psychology laboratory , which containedrats , mazes , screens , and a variety of instruments for the measuring of auditory and visual responses . The sixth floor consisted of dormitory rooms for the out-of-town students . It was a rigidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with European-trained rabbis , many of them in long , dark coats , all of them bearded . For the first part of the day , from nine in the morning to three in the afternoon , we studied only Talmud . From three-fifteen to six-fifteen or seven-fifteen , depending on the schedule of classes we had chosen for ourselves , we went through a normal college curriculum . On Fridays from nine to one , we attended the college ; on Sundays , during that same time span , we studied Talmud . I found that I liked this class arrangement very much ; it divided my work neatly and made it easy for me to concentrateseparately upon Talmud and college subjects . The length of the school day , though , was something else ; I was frequentlyawake until one in the morning , doing homework . Once my father came into my room at ten minutes to one , found me memorizing the section on river flukes from myp197biology textbook , asked me if I was trying to do four years of college all at once , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to bed  --  half an hour later , when I had finished the memorizing . Danny 's gloom and frustration grew worse day by day , despite the fact that the students in his Talmud class looked upon him with open-mouthed awe . He had been placed in Rav Gershenson 's class , the highest in the school , and I had been placed one class below . He was the talk of the Talmud Department by the end of two weeks and the accepted refereeof all Talmudic arguments among the students . He was also learning a great deal from Rav Gershenson , who , as Danny put it , loved to spend at least three days on every two lines he taught . He had quickly become the leader of the few Hasidic students in the school , the ones who walked around wearing dark suits , tieless shirts , beards , fringes , and earlocks . About half of my high school class had entered the college , and I became friendly enough with many of the other nonHasidicstudents . I did n't mix much withthe Hasidim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to everyone . They clung to him as though he were the reincarnation of the Besht , as though he were their student tzaddik , so to speak . But none of this made him too happy ; none of it was able to offset his frustration over Professor Appleman , who , by the time the first semester ended , had him so thoroughly upset that he began to talk about majoring in some other subject . He just could n't see himself spending four years running rats through mazes and checking human responses to blinkinglights and buzzing sounds , he told me . He had received a B for his semester 's work in psychology because he had messed up some math equations on the final examination . He was disgusted . What did experimental psychology have to do with the human mind ? he wanted to know . We were in the week between semesters at the time . Danny was sitting on my bed and I was at my desk , wishing I could help him , he looked so thoroughly sad . But I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little I could offer by way of help , except to urge him to stick out the year , something might come of it , he might even get to like the subject.  | " Did you ever get to like my father and his planned mistakes ? " he asked testily . I shook my head slowly . Reb Saunders had stopped insertingdeliberate errors into his Shabbat evening talks the week we had entered college , but the memory of it still rankled . I told Danny that I had disliked the mistake business and had never really gotten used to it , despite my having witnessed it many times . " So what makes you think sitting long enough through something you hate will get you to like it ? " I had nothing to say to that , except to urge him again to stick out the year with Professor Appleman . " Why do n't you talk to him about it ? " I asked . " About what ? About Freud ? The one time I mentioned a Freudian theory in class , all I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychology as magic was related to science . Dogmatic Freudians , " Danny was imitating Professor Appleman  --  or so I assumed ; I did n't know Professor Appleman , but Danny 's voice had taken on a somewhat professorial quality  --  " ' Dogmatic Freudians are generally to be regarded as akin to the medieval physicists who preceded the era of Galileo . They are interested solely in confirming highly dubious theoretical hypotheses by the logic of analogy and induction , and make no attempt at refutation or intersubjective testing . ' That was my introduction to experimentalpsych . I 've been running rats through mazes ever since . " " Was he right ? " I asked . " Was who right ? " " Professor Appleman . " " Was he right about what ? " " About Freudians being dogmatic ? " " What followers of a genius are n't dogmatic , for heaven 's sake ? The Freudians have plenty to be dogmatic about . Freud was a genius . " " What do they do , make a tzaddik out of him ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm getting a lot of sympathy from you tonight . " " I think you ought to have a heart-to-heart talk with Ap-pleman . " " And tell him what ? That Freud was a genius ? That I hatep199experimental psychology ? You know what he once said in class ? " He assumed the professorial air again . " Gentlemen , psychology may be regarded as a science only to the degree to which its hypotheses are subjected to laboratory testing and to subsequent mathematization . ' Mathematization yet ! What should I tell him , that I hate mathematics ? I 'm taking the wrong course . You should be taking that course , not me ! " " He 's right , you know , " I said quietly . " Who ? " " Appleman . If the Freudians are n't willing to try testing their theories under laboratory conditions , then they are being dogmatic . " Danny looked at me , his face rigid . " What makes you so wise about Freudians all of a sudden ? " he asked angrily . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him quietly . " But I know a lot about inductive logic . One of these days remind me to give you a lecture on inductive logic . If the Freudians  --  " " Damn it ! " Danny exploded . " I never even mentioned the followers of Freud in class ! I was talking about Freud himself ! Freud was a scientist . Psychoanalysis is a scientific tool for exploring the mind . What do rats have to do with the human mind ? " " Why do n't you ask Appleman ? " I said quietly . " I think I will , " Danny said . " I think I 'll do just that . Why not ? What have I got to lose ? It ca n't make me any more miserable than I am now . " " That 's right , " I said . There was a brief silence , during which Danny sat on my bed and stared gloomily down at the floor . " How are your eyes these days ? " I asked quietly . He sat back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They still bother me . These glasses do n't help much . " " Have you seen a doctor ? " He shrugged . " He said the glasses should do it . I just have to get used to them . I do n't know . Anyway , I 'll talk to Applemannext week . The worst that could happen is I drop the course . " He shook his head grimly . " What a miserable business . Two years of reading Freud , and I have to end up doing experimental psychology . "  | " You never know , " I said . " Experimental psychology might come in handy some day . " " Oh , sure . All I need to do is get to love mathematics and rats . Are you coming over this Saturday ? " " I 'm studying with my father Shabbat afternoon , " I told him . " Every Saturday afternoon ? " " Yes . " " My father asked me last week if you were still my friend . He has n't seen you in two months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " You review ? " " No . He 's teaching me scientific method . " Danny looked at me in surprise , then grinned . " You 're planning to try scientific method on Rav Schwartz ? " " No , " I said . Rav Schwartz was my Talmud teacher . He was an old man with a long , gray beard who wore a black coat and was constantly smoking cigarettes . He was a great Talmudist , but he had been trained in a European yeshiva , and I did n't think he would take kindly to the scientific method of studying Talmud . I had once suggested a textual emendation in class , and he had given me a queer look . I did n't think he even understood what I had said . " Well , good luck with your scientific method , " Danny told me , getting to his feet . " Just do n't try it on Rav Gershenson . He knows all about it and hates it , When will my father get to see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I 've got to go home . What 's your father doing in there ? " The sound of my father 's typewriter had been clearly heard throughout the time we had been talking . " He 's finishing another article . " " Tell him my father sends his regards . " " Thanks . Are you and your father talking to each other these days ? " Danny hesitated a moment before answering . " Not really . Only now and then . It 's not really talking . " I did n't say anything . " I think I had really better go home , " Danny said . " It 's late . I 'll meet you in front of your shut Sunday morning . " " Okay . "  |p201I  walked him to the door , then stood there listening to the tapping of his metal-capped shoes on the hallway floor . He went out the double door and was gone . I came back to my room and found my father standing in the doorway that led to his study . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a scarf around his throat . This was his third cold in five months . It was also the first time in weeks that he had been home at night . He had become involved in Zionist activities and was always attending meetings where he spoke about the importance of Palestine as a Jewish homeland and raised money for the Jewish National Fund . He was also teaching an adult studies course in the history of political Zionism at our synagogue on Monday nights and another adult course in the history of American Jewry at his yeshiva on Wednesday nights . He rarely got home before eleven . I would always hear his tired steps in the hallway as he came in the door . He would have a glass of tea , come into my room and chat with me for a few minutes , telling me where he had been and what he had done that night , then he would remind me I did n't have to do four years of college all at once , I should go to bed soon , and he would go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching the next day . He had begun taking his teaching with almost ominous seriousness these past months . He had always prepared for his classes , but there was a kind of heaviness to the way he went about preparing now , writing everything down , rehearsinghis notes aloud  --  as if he were trying to make certain that nothing of significance would remain unsaid , as if he felt the future hung on every idea he taught . I never knew when he went to sleep ; no matter what time I got to bed he was still in his study . He had never regained the weight he had lost duringthe weeks he had spent in the hospital after his heart attack , and he was always tired , his face pale and gaunt , his eyes watery . He stood now in the doorway to his study , wearing the woolen sweater , the scarf , and the round , black skullcap . His feet were in bedroom slippers and his trousers were creased from all the sitting over the typewriter . He was visibly tired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me whatp202Danny had been so excited about . He had heard him through the door , he said . I told him about Danny 's misery over professor Applemaa and experimental psychology . He listened intently , then came into my room and sa , down on my bed with a sigh . " So , " he said , " Danny is discoveringthat Freud is not God . " " I told him at least to talk it over with professor Apple man . " " And ? " " He 'll talk to him next week . " " Experimental psychology , " my father mused . " I know nothing about it . " " He said there was a lot of math in it . " " Ah . And Danny does not like mathematics . " " He hates it , he says . He 's feeling pretty low . He feels he wasted two years reading Freud . " My father smiled and shook his head but remained silent . " Professor Appleman sounds a lot like professor Flesser , " I said . Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an enemy of what he called " ObscurantistContinental philosophies , " which , he explained , included everything that had happened in German philosophy from Fichte to Heidegger , with the exception of Vaihinger and one or two others . My father wanted to know what it was the two professors had in common , and I told him what professor Appleman had said about psychology being a science only to the extent to which its hypotheses can be mathematized . " Professor Flesser made the same remark once about biology , " I said . " You talk about biology in a symbolic logic class ? " my father asked . " We were discussing inductive logic . " " Ah . Of course . The point about mathematizing hypotheses was made by Kant . It is one of the programs of the Vienna Circle logical positivists . " " Who ? " " Not now , Reuven . It is too late , and I am tired . You should go to sleep soon . Take advantage of the nights when you have no schoolwork . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . " " You 're not taking care of yourself , you know . Your voice sounds awful . " He sighed again . " It is a bad cold , " he said . " Does Dr. Grossman know you 're working so hard ? " " Dr. Grossman worries a little bit too much about me , " he said , smiling . " Are you going for another checkup soon ? " " Soon , " he said . " I am feeling fine , Reuven . You worry like Dr. Grossman . Worry better about your schoolwork . I am fine . " " How many fathers do I have ? " I asked . He did n't say anything , but he blinked his eyes a few times . " I wish you 'd take it a little easy , " I said . " This is not a time to take things easy , Reuven . You read what is happening in Palestine . " I nodded slowly . " This is a time to take things easy ? " my father asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irgun boys who die are taking it easy ? " He was talking about what was now going on in Palestine . Two Englishmen , an army major and a judge , had been kidnapedrecently by the Irgun , the Jewish terrorist group in Palestine , and were being held as hostages . A captured memberof the Irgun , Dov Gruner , had been sentenced to hanging by the British , and the Irgun had announced instant retaliationagainst these hostages should the sentence be carried out . This was the latest of a growing list of terrorist activities against the British Army in Palestine . While the Irgun engaged in terror  --  blowing up trains , attacking police stations , cutting communications lines  --  the Haganah continued smugglingJews through the British naval blockade in defiance of the British Colonial Office , which had sealed Palestine off to further Jewish immigration . Rarely did a week go by now without a new act of terror against the British . My father would read the newspaper accounts of these activities , and I could see the anguish in his eyes . He hated violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy of the Irgun , but he hated the British non-immigration policy even more . Irgun blood was being shed for the sake of a fu/ture Jewish state , and he found it difficult to give voice to his feelings of opposition to the acts of terror that were regularly making front-page headlines now . Invariably , the headlines spurred him on to new bursts of Zionist activity and to loud , excited justification of the way he was driving himself in his fund-raising and speechmaking efforts in behalf of a Jewish state . I could see he was beginning to get excited now , too , so to change the subject quickly , I told him Reb Saunders had sent his regards . " He wonders why he does n't see me , " I said . But my father did n't seem to have heard me . He sat on the bed , lost in thought . We were quiet for a long time . Then he stirred and said softly , " Reuven , do you know what the rabbistell us God said to Moses when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " I heard myself say . " He said to Moses , ' You have toiled and labored , now you are worthy of rest . ' " I stared at him and did n't say anything . " You are no longer a child , Reuven , " my father went on . " It is almost possible to see the way your mind is growing . And your heart , too . Inductive logic , Freud , experimental psychology , mathematizing hypotheses , scientific study of the Talmud . Three years ago , you were still a child . You have become a small giant since the day Danny 's ball struck your eye . You do not see it . But I see it . And it is a beautiful thing to see . So listen to what I am going to tell you . " He paused for a moment , as if considering his next words carefully , then continued . " Human beings do not live forever , Reuven . Wea live less than the time it takes to blink an eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be asked what value is there to a human life . There is so much pain in the world . What does it mean to have to suffer so much if our lives are nothing more than the blink of an eye ? " He paused again , his eyes misty now , then went on . " I learned a long time ago , Reuven , that a blink of an eye in itself is nothing . But the eye that blinks , that is something . A span of life is nothing . But the man who lives that span , he is something . He can fill that tiny span with meaning , so its quality is immeasurable though its quantity may be insignificant . Do you understand what I am saying ? A man must fill his life with meaning , meaning is not automatically given to life . It is hard work to fill one'sp205life with meaning . That I do not think you understand yet . A life filled with meaning is worthy of rest . I want to be worthyof rest when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am saying ? " I nodded , feeling myself cold with dread . That was the first time my father had ever talked to me of his death , and his words seemed to have filled the room with a gray mist that blurred my vision and stung as I breathed . My father looked at me , then sighed quietly . " I was a little too blunt , " he said . " I am sorry . I did not mean to hurt you . " I could n't say anything . " I will live for many more years , with God 's help , " my fathersaid , trying a smile . " Between my son and my doctor , I will probably live to be a very old man . " The gray mist seemed to part . I took a deep breath . I could feel cold sweat running down my back . " Are you angry at me , Leuven ? " I shook my head . " I did not want to sound morbid . I only wanted to tell you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I could not do these things , my life would have no value . Merely to live , merely to exist  --  what sense is there to it ? A fly also lives . " I did n't say anything . The mist was gone now . I found the palms of my hands were cold with sweat . " I am sorry , " my father said quietly . " I can see I upset you .. " You frightened me , " I heard myself say . " I am sorry . " " Will you please go for that checkup ? " " Yes , " my father said . " You really frightened me , talking that way . Are you sure you 're all right ? " " I have a bad cold , " my father said . " But I am fine other-wise . " " You 'll go for that checkup ? " " I will call Dr. Grossman tomorrow and make an appointment for next week . All right ? " , , yes. , , " Fime . My young logician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . I did not tell you that I saw Jack Rose yester/day . He gave me a thousand-dollar check for the Jewish NationalFund . " " Another thousand dollars ? " Jack Rose and my father hacbeen boyhood friends in Russia and had come to America orsI ! , the same boat . He was now a wealthy furrier and a thoa oughly nonobservant Jew . Yet , six months ago , he had giver my father a thousand-dollar contribution to our synagogue . " It is strange what is happening , " my father said . " And is exciting . Jack is on the Building Committee of his sync'II gogue . Yes , he joined a synagogue . Not for himself , he tole me . For his grandchildren . He is helping them put up a new building so his grandchildren can go to a modem synagogu and have a good Jewish education . It is beginning to happen everywhere in America . A religious renaissance , some call it . ' " I ca n't see Jack Rose in a synagogue , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our apartment , I had found his open disregard for Jewish tradition distasteful . He was a short man , with round , pink features , always immaculatelydressed , always smoking long , expensive cigars . Once I asked my father why they had remained friends , their views about almost everything of importance were so different . He replied by expressing dismay at my question . Honest differences of opinion should never be permitted to destroy a friendship , he told me . " Have n't you learned that yet , Reuven ? " Now I was tempted to tell my father that Jack Rose was probably using his money to salve a bad conscience . But I did n't . Instead , I said , a little scornfully , " I do n't envy his rabbi . " My father shook his head soberly . " Why not ? You should envy him , Reuven . American Jews have begun to return to the synagogue . " " God help us if synagogues fill up with Jack Roses . " " They will fill up with Jack Roses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will be your task if you become a rabbi . " I looked at him . " If you become a rabbi , " my father said , smiling at me warmly . " When I become a rabbi , you mean . " My father nodded , still smiling . " You would have been a fine university professor , " he said . " I would have liked you top207become a university professor . But I think you have already decided . Am I right ? " " Yes , " I said . " Even with a synagogue full of Jack Roses ? " " Even with a synagogue full of Jack Roses , " I said . " God help me . " " America needs rabbis , " my father said . " Well , it 's better than being a boxer , " I told him . My father looked puzzled . " A bad joke , " I said . " Will you have some tea with me ? " I said I would . " Came . Let us have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So we drank tea and talked some more . My father told me about the Zionist activities he was engaged in , the speeches he was making , the funds he was raising . He said that in a year or two the crisis in Palestine would come to a head . There would be terrible bloodshed , he predicted , unless the British would give over the problem to the United Nations . Many American Jews were not yet aware of what was going on , he said . The English papers did not tell the entire story . A Jew had to read the Yiddish press now if he wished to know everything that was happening in Palestine . American Jews had to be awakened to the problem of a Jewish state . His Zionist group was planning a mass rally in Madison Square Garden , he told me . The publicity would be going out this week , and there would be a large ad soon in the New York Times , announcing the rally . It was scheduled for late February . " I wonder how Reb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the friend of the son of a Zionist , " I mused . I had told my father about Reb Saunders ' explosion . My father sighed . " Reb Saunders sits and waits for the Messiah , " he said . " I am tired of waiting . Now is the time to bring the Messiah , not to wait for him . " We finished our tea . My father returned to his study , and I went to bed . I had some terrible dreams that night , but I could remember none of them when I woke in the morning . It was Friday , and I had nothing planned . Danny alwaysp208spent his mornings studying Talmud , so I decided that rather than waste the day I would go over to the college library and see if I could find something on experimental psychology . It was a little before ten o'clock when I woke , and my father had already left to teach , so Manya served me breakfast alone , calling me a lazy sleepyhead and a few other things in Russian which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the college . The library had a large section devoted to psychology . I found some books on experimental psychology and leafed through them slowly , then checked the indexes and bibliographies . What I discovered made it very clear why Danny was feeling so miserable . I had chosen the books at random , but even a quick glance at them made it apparent that they were all structured along similar lines . They dealt only with experimental data and were filled with graphs , charts , tables , photographs of devices for the measuring of auditory , visual , and tactile responses , and with mathematical translations of laboratory findings . Most of the books did n't even cite Freud in their bibliographies . In one book , Freud was referred to only once , and the passage was far from complimentary . I checked the indexes under " unconscious . " Some of the books did n't even have it listed . One book had this to say : It is impossible here to discuss the " new psychology of the unconscious , " but exaggerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution in psychology caused by psychoanalysisthere is little doubt that it has influenced psychology permanently . And it is well that the teacher should study something of it , partly because of its suggestiveness in many parts of his work , and partly to be on guard against the exaggeratedstatements of extremists , and the uncritical advocacy of freedom from all discipline , based upon them . That " uncritical advocacy of freedom from all discipline " sounded -a lot like Professor Appleman . Then I found somethingthat really sounded like Professor Appleman : Magic depends on tradition and belief . It does not welcome observation , nor does it profit by experiment . On the other hand , science is based on experience ; it is open to correction by observation and experiment.  |p209The  book in which I found that passage was full of tables and graphs showing the results of experiments on frogs , salamanders , rats , apes , and human beings . It did n't mention Freud or the unconscious anywhere . I felt sorry for Danny . He had spent two years studying about the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was studying about the mind from the point of view of physiology . I understood what he had meant when he said that experimental psychology had nothing to do with the human mind . In terms of psychoanalytic theory , it had very little to do with the human mind . But psychoanalysis aside , I thought the books were very valuable . How else could a scienceof psychology be built except by laboratory findings ? And what else could you do in a laboratory except experiment with the physiology of animals and men ? How could you experiment with their minds ? How could anyone subject Freud 's concept of the unconscious to a laboratory test ? Poor Danny , I thought . Professor Appleman , with his experimental psychology , is torturing your mind . And your father , with his bizarre silence  --  which I still could n't understand , no matter how often I thought about it  --  is torturing your soul . I went home , feeling sad and a little helpless . Danny would have to work out his own problem . I could n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began the following Monday , and during lunch Danny told me he planned to speak to Professor Appleman that afternoon . He looked tense and nervous . I suggested that he be polite but honest , and that he listen to what Appleman might have to say . I was a little nervousmyself , but I told him I had done some reading in experimental psychology on Friday and that I thought it had a lot to contribute . How could you have a science without experimentation ? I wanted to know . And how could anyone experiment on the unconscious , which , by definition , seemed to defy laboratory techniques of testing ? I saw Danny become tight-lipped with anger . " Thanks a lot , " he said bitterly . " That 's just what I need now . A kick in the pants from my best friend . " " I 'm telling you how I feel , " I said.  | " And I 'm telling you how I feel ! " he almost shouted . " Thanks a million ! " He stormed angrily out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We usually met outside the building after our final class and went home together , but that evening he did n't show up . I waited about half an hour , then went home alone . The next morning , as I walked up Lee Avenue , I saw him waiting for me in front of the synagogue where my father and I prayed . " Where were you last night ? " he asked . " I waited half an hour , " I said . " What time did you get out ? " " A quarter after seven . " " You were with him an hour ? " " We had a long talk . Listen , I 'm sorry I blew up like that yesterday at lunch . " I told him I had a pretty thick skin and , besides , what was a friend for if not to be blown up at every now and then . We were walking toward the trolley station . It was a bitter cold morning . Danny 's earlocks lifted and fell in the stiff wind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked . " It 's a long story , " Danny said , looking at me sideways and grinning . " We had a long talk about Freud , Freudians , psychology , psychoanalysis , and God . " " And ? " " He 's a very fine person . He said he 's been waiting all term for me to talk to him . " I did n't say anything . But now I was grinning . " Anyway , he knows Freud forwards and backwards . He told me that he was n't objecting to Freud 's conclusions as much as to his methodology . He said Freud 's approach was based on his own limited experiences . He generalized on the basis of a few instances , a few private patients . " ' Ma 's the problem of induction in a nutshell , " I said . " How do you justify jumping from a few instances to a gen-eralization ? " " I do n't know anything about the problem of induction , " Danny said . " That 's your department . Appleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense to me . He admitted that Freud was a genius and a cautious scientist , but hep211said that Freud evolved a theory of behavior based only on the study of abnormal cases . He said that experimental psychologywas interested in applying the methodology of the natural sciences to discover how all human beings behaved . It does n't generalize about personality behavior only on the basis of a certain segment of people . That makes a lot of sense . " " Well , well , " I said , grinning broadly . " He also said his quarrel was mainly with the Freudians , not so much with Freud himself . He said they were happy to earn their fat fees as analysts and refused to let anyone challengetheir hypotheses . " " There 's our trolley , " I said . " Come on ! " The trolley was waiting for a light , and we made it just in time . Some of the people inside stared curiously at Danny as we went up the aisle looking for seats . I had grown accustomed to people staring at Danny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become increasingly self-conscious about his appearance ever since the time he had read Graetz on Hasidism . He looked straight ahead , trying to ignore the stares . We found seats in the rear of the trolley and sat down . " So he said analysts do n't let anyone challenge their hypotheses , " I said . " What happened then ? " " Well , we talked a lot about experimental psychology . He told me that it was almost impossible to study human subjects because it was too difficult to control the experiments . He said we use rats because we can vary the conditions . He repeateda lot of things he 'd already said in class , but he made a lot more sense this time . At least , I think he made a lot more sense . Maybe after what he said about Freud being a genius I was just more willing to listen to him . He said he admired my knowledge of Freud but that in science no one was God , not even Einstein . He said even in religion people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientists take issue with other scientists ? I could n't argue with that . He said experimental psychology would be a healthy balance to my knowledge of Freud . Maybe . I still do n't think it has anything to do with the human mind . It 's more physiology than anything else , I think . Anyway , Appleman told me that if I had any problem with math he was willing to help me asp212much as he could . But his time is-limited , he said , so he suggestedI get a friend to help me on a regular basis . " I did n't say anything . He looked at me and grinned . " Okay , " I said . " I do n't charge very much . " " It wo n't make me love running rats through mazes , " Danny said . " But at least he 's sympathetic . He 's really a fine person . " I smiled at him but did n't say anything . Then I noticed the psychology textbook he was carrying . It was one of the books I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I asked him what he thought of it , and he said it was a grind . " If I ever get to love experimental psychology after this book I 'll assume the Messiah has come , " he said . " Well , just call on your friendly tzaddik for help , " I told him . He looked at me queerly . " I meant me , " I said . He looked away and did n't say anything . We rode the rest of the way to school in silence . So I began coaching Danny in math . He caught on very quickly , mostly by memorizing steps and procedures . He was n't really interested in the why of a mathematical problem but in the how . I enjoyed coaching him and learned a lot of experimental psychology . I found it fascinating , a lot more substantial and scientific than Freud had been , and a lot more fruitful in terms of expanding testable knowledge on how human beings thought and learned . Throughout the early weeks of February , Danny and I met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and discussed the difficulties he was having with his mathematical translationsof psychological experiments . I showed him how to set up his graphs , how to utilize the tables in his textbook , and how to reduce experimental findings to mathematical formulas . I also kept arguing for the value of experimentation . Danny remained convinced of his original argument that experimental psychology had nothing to do with the human mind , though he began to see its value as an aid to learning theory and intelligence testing . His frustration over it went up and down like a barometer , the climate being the extent top213which he was able to comprehend and resolve whatever mathematical problem preoccupied him at any given moment . I saw very little of my father during those early weeks of February . Except for breakfast , supper , and Shabbat , he was never home . Sometime between eleven and twelve every night , he would return from wherever he had been , have a glass of tea , spend a few minutes with me in my room , then go into his study . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though his tired , stooped body and his haggard face made it clear that he was sleeping very little . He had gone for his checkup , and Dr. Grossman had been satisfied with his health , though he had suggested that he get more rest . My father took a vitamin pill every morning now with his orange juice , but they did n't seem to be doing much good . He completelyignored Dr. Grossman 's suggestion that he rest more , and every time I brought up the subject he either waved it away or talked about the violence now going on in Palestine . It was impossible to talk to him about his health . There was nothing more important to him now than the two ideas around which his life revolved : the education of American Jewry and a Jewish state in Palestine . So he continued teachinghis adult classes and planning for the Madison Square Garden rally due to take place in the last week of February . Not only had my home life been affected by Palestine but my school life as well . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Revisionists , who supported the Irgun , to the Neturai Marta , the Guardians of the City , the city being Jerusalem . This latter group was composed of severely Orthodox Jews , who , like Reb Saunders , despised all efforts aimed at the establishment of a Jewish state prior to the advent of the Messiah . A recent influx of Hungarian Jews into our neighborhood had swelled their ranks , and they formed a small but highly vocal element of the school 's student population . Even the rabbinic faculty was split , most of the rabbis voicing their hope for a Jewish state , some of them opposing it , while all of the college faculty seemed to he for it . There were endless discussions during the afternoon college hours about the problem of dual loyalty  --  what sort of allegiance could an American Jew have toward ap214foreign Jewish state ?  --  and invariably these arguments revolvedaround this hypothetical question : On what side would an American Jew fight should America ever declare war against a Jewish state ? I always answered that the question was silly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish state ; during the Second World War she had sent Japanese Americans to fight the Germans , not the Japanese . But my answer never seemed to satisfy anyone . What if America did want to send Jews to fight against a Jewish state ? the theorists countered . What then ? The discussions were quite heated at times , but they went on only among those students and teachers who favored a Jewish state . Many of the Hasidim ignored the question completely . Despising as they did all efforts in behalf of a Jewish state , they despised as well all discussions that had to do with even its possible existence . They called such discussions bitul Torah , time taken away from the study of Torah , and looked upon all the disputants with icy disgust . Toward the middle of February , the various factions began to firm up their ranks as the entire spectrum of Zionist youth movements moved into the school in a drive for membership , the second such drive since I had entered the college . From that time on  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position was clearly defined by the Zionist philosophyof the group he had joined . Most of the pro-Zionist students , myself included , joined a religious Zionist youth group ; a few joined the youth arm of the Revisionists . The antiZioniststudents remained aloof , bitter , disdainful of our Zionism . In the lunchroom one day , one of the Hasidim accused a member of the Revisionist youth group of being worse than Hitler . Hitler had only succeeded in destroying the Jewish body , he shouted in Yiddish , but the Revisionists were trying to destroy the Jewish soul . There was almost a fistfight , and the two students were kept apart with difficulty by members of their respective sides . The incident left a bitter taste in everyone'smouth and succeeded only in increasing the tension between the pro-Zionist and anti-Zionist students . As I expected , Danny did not join any of the Zionist groups . Privately , he told me he wanted to join my group . But he could n't . Did I remember his father 's explosion overp215Zionism ? he wanted to know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How would I like an explosion like that with every meal ? Danny asked me . I did n't think the question required an answer and told him so . Danny nodded grimly . Besides , he added , the anti-Zionists among the Hasidicstudents looked upon him as their leader . How would it be if he joined a Zionist group ? It would do nothing but add to the already existing bitterness . He was trapped by his beard and earlocks , he said , and there was nothing he could do . But one day . . . He did not finish the sentence . He remainedaloof , however , never participating in the quarrels between the pro-Zionist and anti-Zionist groups . And during the near fistfight in the lunchroom , his face went rigid as stone , and I saw him look with hatred at the Hasidic student who had started the quarrel . But he said nothing , and after the disputants had been half carried , half dragged , from the lunchroom he returned immediately to the math problem we had been discussing . In the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister Bevin had announced his intention to bring the Palestine issue to the United Nations in September . My father was delighted , despite the fact that the news cost him some extra nights of work rewriting the speech . he was to give at the rally . He read the speech to me the Shabbat afternoon before the rally . In it he described the two-thousand-year-old Jewish dream of a return to Zion , the Jewish blood that had been shed through the centuries , the indifference of the world to the problem of a Jewish homeland , the desperate need to arouse the world to the realization of how vital it was that such a homeland he established immediately on the soil of Palestine . Where else could the remnant of Jewry that had escaped Hitler 's ovens go ? The slaughter of six million Jews would have meaning only on the day a Jewish state was established . Only then would their sacrifice begin to make some sense ; only then would the songs of faith they had sung on their way to the gas chambers take on meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , as Ahad Ha'am had foreseen . I was deeply moved by the speech , and I was very proud of my father . It was wonderful to know that he would soonp216be standing in front of thousands of people , reading the same words he read to me that Shabbat . The day before the scheduled date of the Madison Square Garden rally there was a violent snowstorm , and my father walked like a ghost through our apartment , staring whitefacedout the window at the swirling snow . It fell the entireday , then stopped . The city struggled to free itself of its white burden , but the streets remained choked all the next day , and my father left in the evening for the rally , wearing a look of doom , his face ashen . I could n't go with him because I had a logic exam the next day and had to remain home to study . I forced myself to concentrate on the logic problems , but somehow they seemed inconsequential to me . I kept seeing my father standing at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking to seats made vacant by the snow . I dreaded the moment I would hear his key in the lock of our apartment door . I did as much studying as I could , hating Professor Flesser for springing the exam on us the way he had done ; then I wandered aimlessly through the apartment , thinking how stupidit was to have all my father 's work ruined by something like a snowstorm . Shortly before one in the morning , I heard him open the door . I was in the kitchen , drinking milk , and I ran out into the hallway . His face was flushed with excitement . The rallyhad been a wild success . The Garden had been packed , ' and two thousand people had stood on the street outside , listening to the speeches over loudspeakers . He was elated . We sat at the kitchen table , and he told me all about it . The police had blocked off the street ; the crowd 's response to the speeches urging an end to the British mandate and the establishment of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been wildly cheered . A senator who had spoken earlier had come up to him after the rally and had enthusiastically shaken his hand , promising him his complete support . There was no question that the rally had been a success . It had been a stunning success  --  despite the snow-choked streets . It was after three in the morning when we finally went to bed . The rally made the front pages of all the New York papers the next day . The English papers carried excerpts of the sena/tor 's speech and briefly mentioned my father . But all the Yiddishpapers quoted him extensively . I was the center of considerableattention on the part of the Zionist students and the target of icy hatred from the ranks of the anti-Zionists . I paid no attention to the fact that Danny did not meet me in the lunchroom . Between my fatigue over lack of sleep and my excitement over the rally , I did quite poorly in the logic exam . But I did n't care . Logic did n't seem at all important now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice telling me over and over again about the rally . That evening I waited for Danny more than half an hour just inside the double door of the school before I decided to go home alone . The next morning he was n't in front of the synagogue . I waited as long as I could , then took the trolley to school . I was sitting at a table preparing for the Talmud session , when I saw him pass me and nod his head in the direction of the door . He looked white-faced and grim , and he was blinking his eyes nervously . He went out , and a moment later I followed . I saw him go into the bathroom , and I went in after him . The bathroom was empty . Danny was urinating into one of the urinals . I stood next to him and assumed the urinating position . Was he all right ? I wanted to know . He was n't all right , he told me bitterly . His father had read the account of the rally in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast , last night at supper , and this morning again at breakfast . Danny was not to see me , talk to me , listen to me , be found within four feet of me . My father and I had been excommunicated from the Saunders family . If Reb Saunders even once heard of Danny being anywhere in my presence , he would remove him immediately from the college and send him to an out-of-town yeshiva for his rabbinicordination . There would be no college education , no bachelor 's degree , nothing , just a rabbinic ordination . If we tried meeting in secret , Reb Saunders would find out about it . My father 's speech had done it . Reb Saunders did n't mind his son reading forbidden books , but never would he let his son be the friend of the son of a man who was advocating the establishment of a secular Jewish state run by Jewish goyim . It was even dangerous for Danny to meet me in the bathroom , but he had to tell me . As if to emphasize how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justp218then , took one look at me , and chose the urinal farthest avr from me . A moment later , Danny walked out . When I can into the hallway , he was gone . I had expected it , but now that it had happened I coulde believe it . Reb Saunders had drawn the line not at secui literature , not at Freud  --  assuming he knew somehow th Danny had been reading Freud  --  but at Zionism . I found impossible to believe . My father and I had been excommur cated  --  not only from the Saunders family , apparently , b : s also from the anti-Zionist element of the Hasidic stude body . They avoided all contact with me , and even steppe out of my way so I would not brush against them in Vr halls . Occasionally I overheard them talking about the Malt ( goyim . During lunch I sat at a table with some of my not Hasidic classmates and stared at the section of the room tleHasidicstudents always took for themselves . They sat to gether in the lunchroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their dark clothes , fringes , beards , and earlocksandit seemed to me that every word they were saying we directed against me and my father . Danny sat among then silent , his face tight . His eyes caught mine , held , then lookecslowly away . I felt cold with the look of helpless pleadingsaw in them . It seemed so incredible to me , so outrageousl absurd . Not Freud but Zionism had finally shattered ou friendship . I went through the rest of the day alternating be tween violent rage at Reb Saunders ' blindness and anguishe frustration at Danny 's helplessness . When I told my father about it that night , he listened ire silence . He was quiet for a long time afterward ; then he sighed and shook his head , his eyes misty . He had known itwould happen , he said sadly . How could it not happen ? " I do n't understand it , abba . " I was almost in tears . " Inmillion years I 'll never understand it . He let Danny read al the books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these years ever though he knew I was your son . Now he breaks us up over this . I just do n't understand it . " " Reuven , what went on between you and Danny all these years was private . Who really knew ? It was probably not dif ficult for Reb Saunders to answer questions from his follow  --  ers , assuming there were any questions , which I doubt , simply by saying that I was at least an observer of the Command.  |p219ments  . But he has no answer anymore to my Zionism . What can he tell his people now ? Nothing . He had to do what he did . How could he let you continue to be friends ? I am sorry I was the cause of it . I brought you together , and now I am - the cause of your separation . I am deeply sorry . " " He 's such a  --  a fanatic ! " I almost shouted . " Reuven , " my father said quietly , " the fanaticism of men like Reb Saunders kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jews of Palestine have an ounce of that same fanaticismand use it wisely , we will soon have a Jewish state . " I could n't say anything else . I was afraid my anger would bring me to say the wrong words . I went to bed early that night but lay awake a long time , trying to remember all the things Danny and I had done togethersince the Sunday afternoon his ball had struck me in the eye.  |p220FOR  THE REST of that semester , Danny and I ate in the same lunchroom , attended the same classes , studied in the same school synagogue , and often rode in the same trolley ear -- and never said a single word to each other . Our eyes met fre quently , but our lips exchanged nothing . I lost all direct contact with him . It was an agony to sit in the same class with him , to pass him in the hallway , to see him in a trolley , to come in and out of the school building with him  --  and not say a word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that frightened me at times , and I consoled mysel with wild fantasies of what I would do to him if he ever fell into my hands . It was an ugly time and it began to affect my schoolworkto a point where some of my college teachers called me intotheir offices and wanted to know what was happening , theyexpected better from me than they were receiving . I madevague allusions to personal problems and went away from them cold with despair . I talked about it with my father as often as I could , but there seemed to be little he could do to help me . He would listen somberly , sigh , and repeat that he had no intention of quarreling with Re ) Saunders , he respectedhis position in spite of its fanaticism . I wondered often during those months whether Danny was also going through these same dreadful experiences . I saw him frequently . He seemed to be losing weight , and I noticed he was wearing different eyeglasses . But he was very carefully avoiding me , and I knew enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get back to his father that we had been seen together . I hated the silence between us and thought it unimaginable that Danny and his father never really talked . Silence was  |p221ugly  , it was black , it leered , it was cancerous , it was death . I hated it , and I hated Reb Saunders for forcing it upon me and his son . I never knew myself capable of the kind of hatred I felt toward Reb Saunders all through that semester . It became , finally , a blind , raging fury , and I would find myself trembling with it at odd moments of the day  --  waiting to get into a trolley car , walking into a bathroom , sitting in the lunchroom , or reading in the library . And my father only added to it , for whenever I began to talk to him of my feelings toward Reb Saunders he invariably countered by defending him and by asserting that the faith of Jews like Reb Saunders had kept us alive through two thousand years of violent persecution . He disagreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no slander against his name or his position . Ideas should be fought with ideas , my father said , not with blind passion . If Reb Saunders was fighting him with passion , that did not mean that my father had to fight Reb Saunders with passion . And Reb Saunders was fighting with passion . He had organizedsome of the Hasidic rebbes in the neighborhood into a group called The League for a Religious Eretz Yisroel . The work of this organization had begun mildly enough in early March with the handing out of leaflets . Its aims were clear : no Jewish homeland without the Torah at its center ; therefore , no Jewish homeland until the coming of the Messiah . A Jewish homeland created by Jewish goyim was to be consideredcontaminated and an open desecration of the name of God . : y the end of March , however , the leaflets had become inflammatory in tone , threatening excommunication to all in the neighborhood who displayed allegiance to Zionism , even at one point threatening to boycott neighborhood stores owned by Jews who contributed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A mass anti-Zionist rally was announced for a date a few days before Passover . It was poorly attended , but it made some of the English papers , and the reports of what had been said were ugly . The student body of the college was tense with suppressed violence . An angry fistfight broke out in a classroom one afternoon , and it was only because the Dean threatened immediate expulsion to any future participants in such quarrelsthat more fistfights were avoided . But the tension was feltp222everywhere ; it spilled over into our studies , and argumen , over Milton , Talleyrand or deductive procedures in loge were often clear substitutes for the outlawed fistfights ove Zionism . I took the finals in the middle of June and came awe ) , from them sick with despair . I had botched my midterm badly , and I did n't do too much better on my finals . M father did n't say a word when he saw my report card at th ; end of June . Both of us were by that time looking forwar very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b together in the cottage near Peekskill . It had been a terrib time , these past four months , and we wanted to get away from the city . But the cottage proved to be not far enough away . W : took to it the horrifying news that the Irgun had hanged twe innocent British sergeants in retaliation for the three Irgunists who were hanged on the twenty-ninth of July . My father wa : ; outraged by the Irgun act , but said nothing more about i after his first burst of anger . Two weeks after we left for the cottage we were back in the city . Urgent Zionist meetings had been called to plan for the coming United Nations ses sion that was to discuss the Palestine problem . My father wee on the Executive Committee of his Zionist group and had to attend the meetings . For the rest of August , I saw my father only on Shabbat . He was gone in the mornings when I woke and he returned at night when I was asleep . He was filled with fiery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself out. could n't talk to him at all about his health . He refused to lis ten . Our Shabbat afternoon Talmud sessions had stopped ; my father spent all of Shabbat resting so as to be prepared fo : each coming week of furious activity . I haunted the apart ment , wandered the streets , barked at Manya , and thought ot : Danny . I remembered him telling me how much he admired and trusted his father , and I could n't understand it . How could he admire and trust someone who would n't talk to him , even if that someone was his father ? I hated his father . Once I even went up to the third floor of the public library , hoping I might find Danny there . Instead , I found an old man sitting in the chair Danny had once occupied , staring nearsightedly at the pages of a scholarly journal . I went away from therep223and walked the streets blindly until it was time to go home to a lonely supper . In the second week of September , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found myself sitting in the auditorium a few seats away from Danny . He looked thin and pale , and constantly blinked his eyes . During the registrar'sbrief words of instruction concerning registration procedure , I saw Danny turn his head , stare at me for a moment , then turn slowly away . His face had remained expressionless ; he had n't even nodded a greeting . I sat very still , listening to the registrar , and felt myself get angry . To hell with you , Danny Saunders , I thought . You could at least show you know I 'm alive . To hell with you and your fanatic father . I became so completely absorbed in my anger that I stopped listening to the instructions . I had to ask one of my classmatesto repeat them to me after the assembly . To hell with you , Danny Saunders , I kept saying to myself all that day . I can live without your beard and earlocks with no trouble at all . You 're not the center of the world , friend . To hell with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall semester officially began two days later , I had promised myself to forget Danny as quickly as possible . I was n't going to let him ruin another semester 's work . One more report card like the one I had shown my fatherat the end of dune and I would n't even be graduated cum laude . To hell with you , Danny Saunders , I kept saying to myself . You could a least have nodded your head . But it proved to be a good deal more difficult to forget him f than I had anticipated , mostly because I had been moved up into Rav Gershenson 's Talmud class where Danny 's presence was always felt . Rav Gershenson was a tall , heavy-shouldered man in his late sixties , with a long , pointed gray beard and thin , tapered fingers that seemed always to be dancing in the air . He used his hands constantly as he talked , and when he did not talk his fingers drummed on his desk or on the open Talmud in front of him . He was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oval face , and a soft voice , which at times was almostinaudible . He was an exciting teacher , though , and he taught Talmud the way my father did , in depth , concentrat/ing for days on a few lines and moving on only when he was satisfied that we understood everything thoroughly . He laid heavy emphasis on the early and late medieval Talmudic commentators , and we were always expected to come to class knowing the Talmud text and these commentators in advance . Then he would call on one of us to read and explain the text  --  and the questions would begin . " What does the Ramban say about Rabbi Akiva 's question ? " he might ask of a particular passage , speaking in Yiddish . The rabbis spoke only Yiddish in the Talmud classes , but the students could speak Yiddish or English . I spoke English . " Everyone agrees with the Ramban 's explanation ? " Rav Gershenson might go on to ask . " The Me'iri does not . Very good . What does the Me'iri say ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer ? " And on and on . There was almost always a point at which the student who was reading the text would become bogged down by the cumulative intricacies of the questions and would stare down at his Talmud , drowning in the shame produced by his inability to answer . There would be a long , dreaded silence , during which Rav Gershenson'sfingers would begin to drum upon his desk or his Talmud . " Nu ? " he would ask quietly . " You do not know ? How is it you do not know ? Did you review beforehand ? Yes ? And you still do not know ? " There would be another long silence , and then Rav Gershenson would look around the room and say quietly , " Who does know ? " and , of course , Danny 's hand would immediately go up , and he would offer the answer . Rav Gershenson would listen , nod , and his fingerswould cease their drumming and take to the air as they accompanied his detailed review of Danny 's answer . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Danny 's answer but questioned him on it instead , and there would then ensue a lengthy dialogue between the two of them , with the class sitting by and listening in silence . Most often these dialogues took only a few minutes , but by the end of September there had already been two occasions when they had lasted more than three quarters of an hour . I was constantly being reminded by these dialogues of the way Danny argued Talmud with his father . It made it not only difficult to forget him but quite impossible . And now it wasp225also I and not only Reb Saunders who was able to listen to Danny 's voice only through a Talmudic disputation . The hours of the Talmud classes in the school were arranged in such a way that we were able to spend from nine in the morning to noon preparing the material to be studied with Rav Gershenson . We would then eat lunch . And from one to three we would have the actual Talmud session itself , the shiur , with Rav Gershenson . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read and explain , so all of us worked feverishly to prepare . But it never really helped , becauseno matter how hard we worked there would always be that dreaded moment of silence when the questions could no longer be answered and Rav Gershenson 's fingers would begin their drumming . There were fourteen students in the class , and each one of us , with the exception of Danny , sooner or later tasted that silence personally . I was called on in the first week of Octoberand tasted the silence briefly before I managed to struggle through with an answer to an almost impossible question . The answer was accepted and amplified by Rav Gershenson , thereby forestalling Danny 's poised hand . I saw him look at me briefly afterward , while Rav Gershenson dealt with my answer . Then he looked away , and a warm smile played on his lips . My anger at him melted away at the sight of that smile , and the agony of not being able to communicate with him returned . But it was a subdued agony now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within limits . It was no longer affecting my schoolwork . By the middle of October everyone in the class , except me , had been called on at least twice . I prepared feverishly , expecting to hear my name called any day . But it was n't . By the end of October , I began to feel uneasy . By the middle of NovemberI still had n't been called on again . I took part in the class discussions , asked questions , argued , raised my hand almost as frequently as Danny raised his in response to Rav Gershenson 's " Who does know ? "  --  but I was not called on to read . I could n't understand it , and it began to upset me . I wondered if this was his way of participating in Reb Saunders ' ban against me and my father . There were other things , too , that were upsetting me at the time . My father had begun to look almost skeletal as a resultp226of his activities , and I dreaded the nights he came wearily home , drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my room , looking hollow-eyed and not really listening to what I told him , and then went into his study . Instead of studying Talmud with him on the Shabbat , I studied alone while he slept . The Palestine issue was being debated now by the United Nations , and the Partition Plan would soon be voted upon . Every day there were headlines announcing new acts of terror and bloodshed ; every week , it seemed , there was another massive rally in Madison Square Garden . I was able to attend two of those rallies . The second time I went I made sure to arrive early enough to get a seat inside . The speeches were electrifying , and I joined in the applause and the cheering until my hands were sore and my voice was hoarse . My father spoke at that rally , his voice booming out clearly through the public address system . He seemed so huge behind the microphones , his voice giving his body the stature of a giant . When he was done , I sat and listened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with tears of pride . In the midst of all this , Reb Saunders ' League for a ReligiousEretz Yisroel continued putting out its anti-Zionist leaflets . Everywhere I went I found those leaflets  --  on the streets , in the trolley cars , in my classroom desks , on my lunch table , even in the school bathrooms . It became clear as November went by that the United Nationsvote on the Partition Plan would take place sometime atthe end of the month . My father was at a meeting on Saturdayevening , November 29 , when the vote was finally held , and I listened to it over the kitchen radio . I cried like a baby when the result was announced , and later , when my father came home , we embraced and wept and kissed , and our tears mingled on our cheeks . He was almost incoherent with joy . The death of the six million Jews had finally been given meaning , he kept saying over and over again . It had happened . After two thousand years , it had finally happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . We were a blessed generation . We had been given the opportunity to see the creation of the Jewish state . " Thank God ! " he said . " Thank God ! Thank God ! " We alternately wept and talked until afterthree in the morning when we finally went to bed . I woke groggy from lack of sleep but still feeling the sensep227of exhilaration , and was eager to get to school to share the joy with my friends . My exhilaration was dampened somewhatduring breakfast when my father and I heard over the radio that a few hours after the United Nations vote a bus on its way from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem had been attacked by Arabs and seven Jews had been killed . And my exhilaration was snuffed out and transformed into an almost uncontrollablerage when I got to school and found it strewn with the leaflets of Reb Saunders ' anti-Zionist league . The leaflets denounced the United Nations vote , ordered Jews to ignore it , called the state a desecration of the name of God , and announced that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . Only the Dean 's threat of immediate expulsion prevented me from engaging in a fistfight that day . I was tempted more than once to scream at the groups of anti-Zionist students huddling together in the halls and classrooms that they ought to go join the Arabs and the British if they were so opposed to the Jewish state . But I managed somehow to control myself and remain silent . In subsequent weeks , I was grateful for that silence . For as Arab forces began to attack the Jewish communities of Palestine , as an Arab mob surged through Princess Mary Avenue in Jerusalem , wrecking and gutting shops and leaving the old Jewish commercial center looted and burned , and as the toll of Jewish dead increased daily , Reb Saunders ' league grew strangely silent . The faces of the anti-Zionist Hasidic students in the school became tense and pained , and all anti-Zionist talk ceased . I watched them every day at lunch as they read to each other the accounts of the bloodshed reported in the Jewish press and then talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads shaking and eyes filling with sadness . " Again Jewish blood is being spilled , " they whispered to one another . " Hitler was n't enough . Now more Jewish blood , more slaughter . What does the world want from us ? Six millionis n't enough ? More Jews have to die ? " Their pain over this new outbreak of violence against the Jews of Palestine outweighed their hatred of Zionism . They did not become Zionists ; they merely became silent . I was glad during those weeks that I had restrained my anger . I received straight A 's in my college courses at the end ofp228that semester . I also received an A in Talmud , despite the fact that Rav Gershenson had only called on me once during the entire four-month period I had spent in his class . I planned to talk to him about it during the inter-semester break , but my father suffered a second heart attack on the first day of that break . He collapsed at a Jewish National Fund meeting and was rushed to the Brooklyn Memorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death for three days . I lived in a nightmare of hallucinatory dread , and if it had n't been for Manya constantly reminding me with gentle kindnessthat I had to eat or I would get sick , I might well have starved . My father was beginning to recover when the second semester began , but he was a shell of a man . Dr. Grossman told me that he would be in the hospital at least six weeks , and that it would take from four to six more months of completerest before he would be able to return to his work . My classmates had all heard the news by the time the semester began , but their words of consolation did n't help very much . The look on Danny 's face , though , when I saw him for the first time , helped a little . He passed me in the hallway , his face a suffering mask of pain and compassion . I thought for a moment he would speak to me , but he did n't . Instead , he brushed against me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His touch and his eyes spoke the words that his lips could n't . I told myself it was bitter and ironic that my father needed to have a heart attack in order for some contact to be established once again between myself and Danny . I lived alone . Manya came in the mornings and left after supper , and during the long winter nights of January and February I was all alone in the house . I had been alone before , but the knowledge that my father would return from his meetings and spend a few minutes with me had made the loneliness endurable . Now he was n't attending meetings and was n't coming into my room , and for the first few days the total silence inside the apartment was impossible for me to take , and I would go out of the house and take long walks in the bitter , cold winter nights . But my schoolwork began top229suffer , and I finally took hold of myself . I spent as much of the early parts of every evening as I could visiting my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely talk and kept asking me if I was taking care of myself . Dr. Grossman had warned me not to tire him , so I left as soon as I could , went home , ate , then spent the night studying . By the time my father had been in the hospital three weeks , the evenings had become almost an automatic routine . The dread of his possible death was gone . It was now a matter of waiting out the silence until he came home . And I waited out the silence by studying . I began especially to study Talmud . In the past , I had done all my Talmud studying on Shabbat and during the morning preparation periods . Now I began to study Talmud in the eveningsas well . I tried to finish my college work as quickly as I could , then I would turn to the passage of Talmud we were studying with Rav Gershenson . I would study it carefully , memorize it , find the various commentaries  --  those which were not printed in the Talmud itself could always be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I tried to anticipateRav Gershenson 's tangled questions . And then I began to do something I had never done before with the Talmud I studied in school . After I was done memorizing the text and the commentaries , I began to go over the text again critically . I checked the Talmudic cross-references for parallel texts and memorized whatever differences I found . I took the huge volumesof the Palestinian Talmud from my father 's library  --  the text we studied in school was the Babylonian Talmud  --  and checked its parallel discussions just to see how it differed from the discussions in the Babylonian Talmud . I worked carefully and methodically , using everything my father had taught me and a lot of things I now was able to teach myself . I was able to do all of this in real depth because of Rav Gershenson 's slow-paced method of teaching . And by doing all of this , I was able to anticipate most of Rav Gershenson 's questions . I also became more and more certain of when he would call on me again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in October . And it was now the middle of February . As a result of my night sessions with Talmud , I had pulled ahead of the class by at least five or six days and was tangled in one of the most corn/plicated discussions I had ever encountered . The complication was caused not only by the Talmud text itself , which seemed filled with gaps , but by the commentaries that struggled to explain it . The text consisted of nine lines . One of the commentarieson the text ran to two and a half pages , another ran to four pages . Neither was very clear . A third commentary , however , explained the text in six lines . The explanation was terse , clipped , and simple . The only thing wrong with it was that it seemed not to be based on the text it was explaining . A later commentary tried to reconcile the three commentaries by the method of pilpul , the result being a happy one for someone who enjoyed pilpul but quite strained as far as I was concerned . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer and closer to this text , I became more and more convinced that Rav Gershenson was going to call on me to read and explain it . I did n't quite know why I was convinced of that ; I just knew that I was . I began painfully to unravel the puzzle . I did it in two ways . First , in the traditional way , by memorizing the text and the commentaries , and then inventing all sorts of questions that Rav Gershenson might ask me . I would ride the trolley , walk the streets , or lie in bed  --  and ask myself questions . Second , in the way my father had taught me , by attempting to find or reconstruct the correct text , the text the commentator who had offered the simple explanation must have had before him . The first way was relatively simple ; it was a matter of brute memorization . The second way was tortuous . I searched endlessly through all the cross-references and all the parallel passenges in the Palestinian Talmud . When I was done , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I now had to reconstruct the text upon which the simplecommentary had been based . I did it by working backward , using the commentary as a base , then asking myself what passage among the four versions the commentator could have had before him as he wrote the commentary . It was painstaking work , but I finally thought I had it down right . It had taken hours and hours of precious time , but I was satisfiedI had the correct text , the only text that really made sense . I had done it this way only to satisfy myself . When Rav Gershenson called on me , I would , of course , only use the first method of explanation . When my father returnedp231from the hospital , I would show him what I had done with the second method . I felt very proud of my accomplishment . Three days later , we came to that passage in our Talmud class , and for the second time that year Rav Gershenson called out my name and asked me to read and explain . The class was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier that they dreaded being called on for that passage ; they had n't been able to make any sense at all out of it and the commentaries were impossible . I was a little frightened , too , but very eager to show off what I had learned . When I heard my name called , I felt myself tingle with a mixture of fear and excitement , as if a tiny electric shock had gone through my body . Most of the students had been waiting apprehensivelyto hear who would be asked to read . They had sat staring down at their texts , afraid to meet Rav Gershenson'seyes . Now they were all looking at me , even Danny was looking at me , and from one of the students at my right came a barely audible sigh of relief . I bent over my Talmud , put the index finger of my right hand below the first word of the passage , and began to read . Every Talmudic passage is composed of what , for the sake of convenience , might best be called thought units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total discussion that makes up the passage . It might consist of a terse statement of law , or a question on the statement , an answer to the question , a brief or lengthy commentary on a Biblical verse , and so on . The Talmud contains no punctuation marks , and it is not always a simple matter to determine where a thought unit begins and ends ; occasionally , a passage will have a tight , organicflow to it which makes breaking it up into thought units difficult and somewhat arbitrary . In most instances , however , the thought units are clearly discernible , and the decisionon how to break up a passage into such units is a matter of common sense and a feel for the rhythm of the argument . The need to break up a passage into its thought units is simple enough . One has to decide when to stop reading and start explaining , as well as when to appeal to the commentariesfor further explanation . I had broken up the passage into its thought units as I had studied it , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and begin my explanations . I read aloud a **25;9915;TOOLONG is flint ! she said to herself after a closer look . I 'm sure of it . I need a hammerstone to break one open , but I 'm just sure of it . Excitedly , Ayla scanned the beach for a smooth oval stone she could hold comfortably in her hand . When she found one , she struck the chalky outer covering of the nodule . A piece of the whitish cortex broke off , exposing the dull sheen of the dark gray stone within . It is flint ! I knew it was ! Her mind raced with thoughts of the tools she could make . I can even make some spares . Then I wo n't have to worry so much about breaking something . She lugged over a few more of the heavy stones , flushed out of the chalk deposits far upstreamand carried by surging current until they came to rest at the foot of the stone wall . The discovery encouraged her to explore further . The wall , that in times of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out toward the inside bend of the river . Contained within its normal banks , the water level was low enough to allow easy access around it , but when she looked beyond , she stopped . Spread out before her was the valley she had glimpsed from above . Around the bend , the river broadened and bubbled over and around rocks exposed by shallower water . It flowed east at the foot of the steep opposite wall of the gorge . Along its near bank trees and brush protected from the cutting wind grew to their full luxuriant height . On her left , beyond the stone barrier , the wall of the gorge veered away , and its slope decreased to a gradual incline that blended into steppes toward the north and east . Ahead , the wide valley was a lush field of ripe hay moving in waves as gusts of wind blew down the north slope , and midway down its length the small herd of steppe horses was grazing . Ayla , breathing in the beauty and tranquillity of the scene , could hardly believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry windy prairie . The valley was an extravagant oasis hidden in a crack of the arid plains ; a microcosm of abundance , as though nature , constrained to utilitarian economy on the steppes , lavished her bounty in extra measure where the opportunity allowed it . The young woman studied the horses in the distance , intrigued by them . They were sturdy , compact animals with rather short legs , thick necks , and heavy heads with overhanging noses that reminded her of the large overhanging noses of some men of the Clan . They had heavy shaggy coats and short stiff manes . Though some tended to gray , most were shades of buff ranging from the neutral beige of the dust to the color of ripe hay . Off to one side stood a hay-coloredstallion , and Ayla noticed several foals of the same shade . The stallion lifted his head , shaking his short mane , and whinnied . " Proud of your clan , are n't you ? " she motioned , smiling . She started walking down the field close to the brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciously thinking about it , as aware of the medicinal qualities as she was of the nutritionalvalues . It had been part of her training as a medicine woman to learn and collect plants for their healing magic , and there was very little she could n't identify immediately . This time food was her aim . She noticed the leaves and the dried umbeled flower stalk that pointed to wild carrots a few inches below the ground , but passed them by as though she had n't seen them . The impression was misleading . She would remember the place just as precisely as if she had marked it , but vegetation would stay put . Her sharp eyes had picked up the trail of a hare , and at the moment she was concentrating on securing meat . With the silent stealth of an experienced hunter , she followed fresh droppings , a bent blade of grass , a faint print in the dirt , and just ahead she distinguished the shape of the animal hiding in camouflagingcover . She pulled her sling from her waist thong and reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the hare bolted she was ready . With the unconscious grace of years of practice , she hurled a stone and the next instant a second one , and heard a satisfying thwack , thwack . Both missiles found their mark . Ayla picked up her kill and thought about the time she had taught herself that double-stone technique . An overconfident attempt to kill a lynx had taught her the extent of her vulnerability . But it had taken long sessions of practice to perfect a way to place a second stone in position on the downstroke of the first cast so she could rapid-fire two stones in quick succession . On her way back , she chopped a branch from a tree , sharpened a point on one end , and used it to dig up the wild carrots . She put them in a fold of her wrap and chopped off two forked branches before returning to the beach . She put down the hare and the roots and got the fire drill and platform out of her basket , then began gathering dry driftwood from under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the protective branches of the trees . With the same tool she had used to sharpen the digging stick , one with a V-shaped notch on the sharp edge , she shaved curls from a dry stick . Then she peeled loose hairy bark from the old stalks of sagebrush , and dried fuzz from the seed pods of fireweed. 40 41She found a comfortable place to sit , then sorted the wood according to size and arranged the tinder , kindling , and larger wood around her . She examined the platform , a piece of dry clematis vine , dug a little notch out along one edge with a flint borer , and fitted an end of the previous season 's dry woody cattail stalk into the hole to check the size . She arranged the fireweed fuzz in a nest of stringy bark under the notch of the fire platform and braced it with her foot , then put the end of the cattail stalk in the notch and took a deep breath . Fire makingtook concentration . Placing both palms together at the top of the stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exerting a downward pressure . As she twirled it , the constant pressure moved her hands down the stick until they nearly touched the platform . If she 'd had another person to help , that would have been the time for that person to start at the top . But , alone , she had to let go at the bottom and reach quickly for the top again , never letting the rhythm of the twirling stop , nor letting up the pressure for more than an instant , or the heat generated by the friction would dissipate and would not build up enough to start the wood smoldering . It was hard work and allowed no time to rest . Ayla got into the rhythm of the movement , ignoring the sweat that formed on her brow and started running into her eyes . With the continuousmovement , the hole deepened and sawdust from the soft wood accumulated . She smelled woodsmoke and saw the notch blacken before she saw a wisp of smoke , encouraging her to continue though her arms ached . Finally , a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nest of dry tinder beneath it . The next stage was even more critical . If the ember died , she 'd have to begin all over again . She bent over so that her face was so near the coal she could feel the heat , and began to blow on it . She watched it grow brighter with each breath , then die down again as she gulped another mouthful of air . She held tiny curled shavings to the bit of smoldering wood and watched them brighten and turn black without igniting . Then a tiny flame burst out . She blew harder , fed it more shavings , and , when she had a small pile burning , added a few sticks of kindling . She rested only after the large driftwood logs were blazing and the fire was firmly established . She gathered a few more pieces and piled them nearby ; then with another , slightly larger notched tool , she shaved the bark off the green branch she had used to dig up the wild carrots . She planted the forked branches upright on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortably between them and then turned to skinning the hare . By the time the fire had died down to hot coals , the hare was skewered and ready for roasting . She started to wrap the entrails in the hide to dispose of it as she had done while traveling , then changed her mind . I could use the fur , she thought . It would only take a day or so . ... She rinsed the wild carrots in the rive  --  nd the blood off her hand  --  nd wrapped them in plantain leaves . The large fibrous leaves were edible , but she could n't help thinking of their other use as sturdy , healing bandages for cuts or bruises . She put the leaf-wrapped wild carrots next to the coals . She sat back and relaxed for a moment , then decided to stake out the furry hide . While her meal cooked , she scraped away the blood vessels , hair follicles , and membranes from the inside of the skin with the broken scraper , and thought about making a new one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her thoughts wandered . Maybe I should stay here a few days , finish this hide . Need to make some tools anyway . Could try to reach that hole in the wall upriver . That hare is starting to smell good . A cave would keep me out of the rai  --  ight not be usable , though . She got up and turned the spit , then started working from a differentside . I ca n't stay too long . I 've got to find people before winter . She stopped scraping the skin , her attention suddenly focused on the inner turmoil that was never far from the surface of her mind . Where are they ? Iza said there were many Others on the mainland . Why ca n't I find them ? What am I going to do , Iza ? Without warning , tears welled up and overflowed . Oh , Iza , I miss you so much . And Creb . And Uba , too . And Durc , my baby . . . my baby . I wanted you so much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not deformed , just a little different . Like I am . No , not like me . You 're Clan , you 're just going to be a little taller , and your head looks a little different . Someday you 'll be a great hunter . And good with the sling . And run faster than anyone . You 'll win all the races at the Clan Gathering . Maybe not the wrestling , you might not be that strong , but you 'll be strong . But who will play the game of making sounds with you ? And who will make the happy noises with you ? I 've got to stop this , she scolded herself , wiping tears away with the back of her hand . I should be glad you have people who love you , 42 43Durc . And when you 're older , Ura will come and be your mate . Oda promised to train her to be a good woman for you . Ura is n't deformed , either . She 's just different , like you . I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to check on her meal , moving just to be doing something to take her mind off her thoughts . The meat was more rare than she liked it , but she decided it was done enough . The wild carrots , small and pale yellow , were tender and had a sweet tangy taste . She missed the salt that had always been available near the inland sea , but hunger provided the right seasoning . She let the rest of the hare cook a little longer while she finished scraping the skin , feeling better after she ate . The sun was high when she decided to investigate the hole in the wall . She stripped and swam across the river , scrambling up the tree roots to climb out of the deep water . It was difficult scaling the nearly vertical wall , making her wonder if it was worthwhile even if she found a cave . She was disappointed anyway when she reached a narrowledge in front of the dark hole and found it was hardly more than a depression in the rock . The scat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be an easier way down from the steppes , but there was n't room for anything much larger . She turned to start down , then turned farther . Downstream and slightly lower on the other wall , she could see the top of the rock barrier that jutted toward the bend of the river . It was a broad ledge , and at the back of it there appeared to be another hole in the face of the cliff , a much deeper hole . From her vantage point , she saw a steep but possible way up . Her heart was beating with excitement . If it was a cave of any size at all , she 'd have a dry place to spend the night . About halfway down , she jumped into the river , eager to investigate . I must have passed by it on the way down last night , she thought as she started up . It was just too dark to see . She remembered , then , that an unknown cave should always be approached with caution , and she returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had very carefully felt her way down , in good light she found she did n't need handholds . Over the millennia , the river had cut sharper into the opposite bank ; the wall on this side was n't as steep . As she neared the ledge , Ayla held her sling ready and advancedwith caution . All her senses were alert . She listened for the sounds of breathing or small scufflings ; looked to see if there were any telltale signs of recent habitation ; smelled the air for the distinctive odors of carnivorousanimals , or fresh scat , or gamy meat , opening her mouth toallow taste buds to help catch the scent ; let her bare skin detect any sense of warmth coming out of the cave ; and allowed intuition to guide her as she noiselessly approached the opening . She stayed close to the wall , crept up to the dark hole , and looked in . She saw nothing . The opening , facing the southwest , was small . The top cleared her head , but she could reach her hand up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance , then leveled out . Loess , blown in on the wind , and debris carried in by animals that had used the cave in the past had built up a layer of soil . Originally uneven and rocky , the floor of the cave had a dry , hard-packed , earth surface . As she peered around the edge , Ayla could detect no sign that the cave had been used recently . She slipped in , silently , noticing how cool it was compared with the hot sunny ledge , and waited for her eyes to adjust to the dim interior . There was more light in the cave than she expected , and when she moved in farther , she saw sunlight through a hole above the entrance and understood why . She also understooda more practical value to the hole . It would allow smoke to get out without filling the upper reaches of the cave , a distinct advantage . Once her eyes adjusted , she discovered she could see surprisingly well . Light coming in was an advantage , too . The cave was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from the entrance , wideninguntil they came to a fairly straight back wall . The general shape was roughly triangular , with the apex at the mouth and the east wall longer than the west . The darkest place was the east back corner ; the place to investigate first . She crept slowly along the east wall , watching for cracks or passagewaysthat could lead to deeper recesses holding hidden menaces . Near the dark corner , rock cleaved from the walls lay on the floor in a jumbled heap . She climbed the rocks , felt a shelf , and emptiness beyond it . She considered getting a torch , then changed her mind . She had n't heard , smelled , or felt any signs of life , and she could see a little way in . Putting her sling and stones in one hand , wishing she had stopped to put on her wrap so she would have a place to put her weapons , she hoisted herself up on the shelf . The dark opening was low ; she had to stoop to move inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roof sloping to meet the floor of the niche . At the back was a pile of bones . She reached for one , then climbed down and worked her way along the back wall , and along the west wall back to the entrance . It was a blind cave , and , except for the44 45small niche , had no other chambers or tunnels leading to unknown places . It felt snug and secure . Ayla shaded her eyes against the bright sunlight as she walked out to the far edge of the cave 's terrace and looked around . She was standing on top of the jutting wall . Below her on the right was the pile of driftwood and bones , and the rocky beach . To the left , she could see far down the valley . In the distance , the river turned south again , curving around the base of the steep opposite wall , while the left wall had flattened into steppes . She examined the bone in her hand . It was the long legbone of a giant deer , aged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been split to get at the marrow . The pattern of teeth , the way the bone had been gnawed , looked familiar , and yet not . It had been made by a feline , she was sure . She knew carnivores , better than anyone in the clan . She had developed her hunting skills on them , but only the smaller and medium-size varieties . These marks had been made by a large cat , a very large cat . She spun around and looked at the cave again . A cave lion ! That must have been the den of cave lions once . That niche would be a perfect place for a lioness to have her cubs , she thought . Maybe I should n't spend the night in it . It might not be safe . She looked at the bone again . But this is so old , and the cave has n't been used for years . Besides , a fire near the entrance will keep animals away . It is a nice cave . Not many are that nice . Lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think it gets wet inside , spring floods do n't reach this high . There 's even a smoke hole . I think I 'll go get my fur and basket , and some wood , and bring up the fire . Ayla hurried back down to the beach . She spread out the tent hide and her fur on the warm stone ledge when she returned , and put the basket inside the cave , then brought up several loads of wood . Maybe I 'll get some hearthstones , too , she thought , starting down again . Then she stopped . Why do I need hearthstones ? I 'm only staying a few days . I 've got to keep looking for people . I 've got to find them before winter ... . What if I do n't find people ? The thought had been hovering for a long time , but she had n't allowed herself to frame it precisely before ; the consequences were too frightening . What will I do if winter comes and I still have n't found any people ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have a place to stay that is dry and warm , and out of the wind and snow . No cave to .. . She looked at the cave again , then at the beautiful protected valleyand the herd of horses far down the field , then back at the cave again . It 's a perfect cave for me , she said to herself . It would be a long time before I found one as good . And the valley . I could gather and hunt and store food . There 's water , and more than enough wood to last the winter , many winters . There 's even flint . And no wind . Everything I need is right her  --  xcept people . I do n't know if I could stand it , being alone all winter . But it 's already so late in the season . I 'm going to have to start soon to get enough food stored . If I have n't found anyone yet , how do I know I will ? How do I know they 'd let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know them . Some of them are as bad as Broud . Look what happened to poor Oda . She said the men who forced her , like Broud forced me , were men of the Others . She said they looked like me . What if they are all like that ? Ayla looked again at the cave , and then at the valley . She walked around the perimeter of the ledge , kicked a loose rock off the edge , stared off at the horses , then came to a decision . " Horses , " she said . " I 'm going to stay in your valley for a while . Next spring I can start looking for the Others again . Right now , if I do n't get ready for winter , I wo n't be alive next spring . " Ayla 's speech to the horses was made with only few sounds , and those were clipped and guttural . She used sound only for names or to emphasize the rich , complex , and fully comprehensive language she spoke with the gracefulflowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she remembered . Once her decision was made , Ayla felt a sense of relief . She had dreaded the thought of leaving this pleasant valley and facing more grueling days of traveling the parched windy steppes , dreaded the thought of traveling any more at all . She raced down to the rocky beach and stooped to get her wrap and amulet . As she reached for the small leather pouch , she noticed the glitter of a small piece of ice . How can there be ice in the middle of summer ? she wondered , picking it up . It was not cold ; it had hard precise edges and smooth flat planes . She turned it this way and that , watching its facets sparklingin the sun . Then she happened to turn it at just the right angle for the prism to separate the sunlight into the full spectrum of colors , and caught her breath at the rainbow she cast on the ground . Ayla had never seen a clear quartz crystal . The crystal , like the flint and many of the other rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the place . The gleaming stone had been torn from its birthplace by the even greater force of the element itdeleted linesthough he had changed her . She felt a tingling , a prickling , a goosebump-raisingnausea and weakness , and a deep fear of what her death might mean to the entire Clan . She tried to shake off the feeling . Picking up the leather pouch , she put her collection back in , then added the quartz crystal . She retied the amulet and examined the thong for signs of wear . Creb told her she would die if she ever lost it . She noticed a slight difference in weight when she put it back on . Sitting alone on the rocky beach , Ayla wondered what had happened before she was found . She could not recall anything of her life before , but she was so different . Too tall , too pale , her face nothing like those of the rest of the Clan . She had seen her reflection in the still pool ; she was ugly . Broud had told her often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly woman ; no man wanted her . I never wanted one of them , either , she thought . Iza said I needed a man of my own , but will a man of the Others want me any more than a man of the Clan ? No one wants a big ugly woman . Maybe it 's just as well to stay here . How do I know I 'd find a mate even if I did find the Others ? ondalar crouched low and watched the herd through a screen of tall , golden-green grass , bent with the weight of unripe seed heads . The smell of horse was strong , not from the dry wind in his face carrying their hot rangy odor , but from the ripe dung he had rubbed on his body and held in his armpits to disguise his own scent if the wind shifted . The hot sun glistened off his sweaty bronzed back , and a tickle of perspiration ran down the sides of his face ; it darkened the sunbleachedhair plastered to his forehead . A long strand had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck , and the wind whipped it , annoyingly , in his face . Flies buzzed around him , landing occasionally to take a bite , and a cramp was starting in his left thigh from holding the tense crouch . They were petty irritations , hardly noticed . His attention was focused on a stallion nervously snorting and prancing , uncannily aware of impending danger to his harem . The mares were still grazing , but in their seemingly random movements , the dams had put themselves between their foals and the men . Thonolan , a few feet away , was crouched in the same tense position , a spear held level with his right shoulder and another in his left hand . He glanced toward his brother . Jondalar lifted his head and flicked his eyes at a dun mare . Thonolan nodded , shifted his spear minutely for better balance , and prepared to spring . As though a signal passed between them , the two men jumped up together and sprinted toward the herd . The stallion reared , screamed a warning , and reared again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran straight for the male horse , yelling and whooping , trying to spook him . The ploy worked . The stallion was not accustomed to noisy predators ; four-legged hunters attacked with silent stealth . He whinnied , started toward the man , then dodged and gallopedafter his retreating herd . The two brothers pounded after them . The stallion saw the maredeleted linesrubbed his eyes , and stretched . " Have you been up all night ? I told you to wake me . " " I was thinking and did n't feel like going to bed . There 's some hot sage tea if you want some . " " Thanks , " Thonolan said , scooping steaming liquid into a wooden bowl . He squatted down in front of the fire , cupping the bowl in both hands . The early morning air was still cool , the grass wet with dew , and he wore only a breechclout . He watched small birds darting and flitting around the scant brush and trees near the river , chirping noisily . A flock of cranes that nested on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , did you do it ? " he finally asked . " Do what ? " " Find the meaning of life . Is n't that what you were worried about when I went to bed ? Though why you 'd stay up all night for that , I 'll never know . Now , if there was a woman around . . . Do you have one of Doni 's blessed hidden in the willows . . . ? " " Do you think I 'd tell you if I did ? " Jondalar said , grinning . Then his smile softened . " You do n't have to make bad jokes to humor me , Little Brother . I 'm going with you , all the way to the end of the river , if you want . Only , what will you do then ? " " Depends what we find there . I thought the best thing for me to do was go to bed . You 're not fit company for anyone when you get in one of those moods . I 'm glad you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten used to you , bad moods and all . " " I told you , someone has to keep you out of trouble . " " Me ? Right now I could use a little trouble . It 'd be better than sitting around waiting for that meat to dry . " " It will only be a few days , if the weather holds . But now I'm -- not so sure I should tell you what I saw . " Jondalar 's eyes twinkled . " Come on , Brother . You know you will anyway .... " " Thonolan , there 's a sturgeon in that river so big . . . But there 's no point in fishing for it . You would n't want to wait around for fish to dry , too . " " How big ? " Thonolan said , standing up and eagerly facing the river . " So big , I 'm not sure both of us together could haul it in . " " No sturgeon is that big . " " The one I saw was . " " Show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The Great Mother ? Do you think I canmake a fish come and show off for you ? " Thonolan looked chagrined . " I 'll show you where I saw it , though , " Jondalar said . The two men walked to the edge of the river and stood near a fallen tree that extended partway into the water . As though to tempt them , a large shadowy shape moved silently upstream and stopped under the tree near the river bottom , undulating slightly against the current . " That must be the grandmother of all fish ! " Thonolan whispered . " But can we land it ? " " We can try ! " " It would feed a Cave , and more . What would we do with it ? " " Were n't you the one who said the Mother never lets anything go to waste ? The hyenas and wolverines can have a share . Let 's get the spears , " Thonolan said , anxious to try the sport . " Spears wo n't do it , we need gaffs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make gaffs . " " If we do n't , we 'll never bring her in . She 'd just slip off a spear ? we need something with a back hook . It would n't take long to make . Look , that tree over there . If we cut off limbs just below a good sturdy branch for  --  e do n't have to worry about reinforcing , we 'll only use it once , " Jondalar was punctuating his description with motionsin the air , " then cut the branch off short and sharpen it , we 've got a back hook .... " " But what good will it do if she 's gone before we get them made ? " Thonolan interrupted . " I 've seen her there twic  --  t seems to be a favorite resting place . She 'd probably come back . " " But who knows how long that would take . " " Have you anything better to do right now ? " Thonolan made a wry smile . " All right , you win . Let 's go make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then stopped in surprise . Several men had surrounded them and looked distinctly unfriendly . " Where did they come from ? " Thonolan said in a hoarse whisper . " They must have seen our fire . Who knows how long they 've been out there . I 've been up all night watching for scavengers . They could have been waiting until we did something careless , like leaving our spears behind . " " They do n't look too sociable ; none of them has made a gesture of welcome . What do we do now ? " " Put on your biggest , friendliest smile , Little Brother , and you make the gesture . " 54 55Thonolan tried to think self-assured and smiled what he hoped was a confident grin . He put both his hands out and started toward them . " I am Thonolan of the Zelan ... " His progress was halted by a spear quivering in the ground at his feet . " Any more good suggestions , Jondalar ? " " I think it 's their turn . " One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others sprang toward them . With the points of spears they were urged forward . " You do n't have to get nasty , friend , " Thonolan said , feeling a sharp prick . " I was-going that way when you stopped me . " They were brought back to their own campfire and pushed down roughly in front of it . The one who had spoken before barked another command . Several men crawled into the tent and hauled everything out . The spears were taken from the backframes and the contents spilled on the ground . " What do you think you 're doing ? " Thonolan shouted , starting to get up . He was reminded to sit , forcibly , and felt a trickle of blood running down his arm . " Relax , Thonolan , " Jondalar warned . " They look angry . I do n't think they 're in a mood for objections . " " Is this the way to treat Visitors ? Do n't they understand rights of passage for those on a Journey ? " " You were the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You take your chances ; that 's what a Journey is all about . " " Thanks , " Thonolan said , reaching for the stinging cut on his arm and looking at his blood-smeared fingers . " That 's just what I needed to hear . " The one who seemed to be the leader spat out a few more words and the two brothers were hauled to their feet . Thonolan , in his loincloth , was given only a cursory glance , but Jondalar was searched and his bone-handled flint knife was taken . A man reached for the pouch fastened to his belt , and Jondalar grabbed for it . The next instant he felt a sharp pain at the back of his head and slumped to the ground . He was stunned for only a short while , but when his head cleared , he found himself stretched out on the ground , staring into Thonolan 's worried gray eyes , his hands bound with thongs behind his back . " You were the one who said it , Jondalar . " " Said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objections . " " Thanks , " Jondalar remarked with a grimace , suddenly aware of a bad headache . " That 's just what I needed to hear . " " What do you suppose they 're going to do with us ? " " We 're still alive . If they were going to kill us , they 'd have done it , would n't they ? " " Maybe they 're saving us for something special . " The two men lay on the ground , listening to voices and watching the strangers moving about their camp . They smelled food cooking and their stomachs growled . As the sun rose higher , the glaring heat made thirst a worse problem . As the afternoon wore on , Jondalar dozed , his lack of sleep from the night before catching up with him . He woke with a start to shouts and commotion . Someone had arrived . They were dragged to their feet , and gaped in amazement at a burly man striding toward them carrying a white-haired , wizened old woman on his back . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped off her human steed , with obvious deference . " Whoever she is , she must be pretty important , " Jondalar said . A bruising blow in the ribs silenced him . She walked toward them leaning on a knobbed staff with a carved finial . Jondalar stared , sure he had never seen anyone so old in his life . She was child-size , shrunken with age , and the pink of her scalp could be seen through her thin white hair . Her face was so wrinkled that it hardly looked human , but her eyes were oddly out of place . He would have expected dull , rheumy , senile eyes in someone so old . But hers were bright with intelligence and crackled with authority . Jondalarwas awed by the tiny woman , and a little fearful for Thonolan and himself . She would not have come unless it was very important . She spoke in a voice cracked with age , yet surprisingly strong . The leader pointed at Jondalar , and she directed a question to him . " I 'm sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke again , tapped her chest with a hand as gnarled as her staff , and said a word that sounded like " Haduma . " Then she pointed a knobby finger at him . " I am Jondalar of the Zelandonii , " he said , hoping he understood her meaning . She cocked her head as though she had heard a sound . " Zel-an-donyee ? " she repeated slowly . Jondalar nodded , licking his dry , parched lips nervously . She stared at him speculatively , then spoke to the leader . His answerwas brusque , and she snapped a command , then turned her back56 57and walked to the fire . One of the men who had been guarding them pulled out a knife . Jondalar glanced at his brother and saw a face that expressed his own emotions . He braced himself , sent a silent plea to the Great Earth Mother , and closed his eyes . He opened them with a surge of relief when he felt the thongs cut away from his wrists . A man was approaching with a bladder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Thonolan , whose hands had also been freed . He opened his mouth to say a word of appreciation and then , remembering his bruised ribs , thought better of it . They were escorted to the fire by guards who hovered close with menacing spears . The burly man who had carried the old woman brought a log , put a fur robe on it , then stood to the side with his hand on his knife handle . She settled herself on the log , and Jondalar and Thonolan were made to sit in front of her . They were careful to make no moves that might be construed as endangering to the old woman ; they had no doubt of their fate if any man there even thought they might try to harm her . She stared at Jondalar again , not saying a word . He met her gaze , but , as the silence continued , he began to feel disconcerted and uncomfortable . Suddenly , she reached into her robe , and with eyes blazing anger and a spate of acrimonious words that left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she held out an object toward him . His eyes widened in wonder . It was the carved stone figure of the Mother , his donii , she held in her hand . Out of the corner of his eye , he watched the guard beside him flinch . There was something about the donii he did n't like . The woman ended her tirade , and , lifting her arm dramatically , flung the statuette to the ground . Jondalar jumped involuntarily and reached for it . His anger at her desecration of his sacred object showed in his face . Ignoring the prick of a spear , he picked it up and cradled it protectively in his hands . A sharp word from her caused the spear to be withdrawn . He was surprised to see a smile on her face and the glint of amusement in her eyes , but he was n't at all sure if she smiled out of humor or malice . She got up from the log and walked closer . She was not much taller standing than he was seated and , facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startling , vivid blue eyes . Then she stepped back , turned his head from side to side , felt the muscle of his arm , and surveyed the breadth of his shoulders . She motioned for him to get up . When he did n't quite understand , the guard prodded him into comprehension . She tilted her head back to look up at all six feet six inches ofhim , then walked around him , poking the hard muscles of his legs . Jondalar had the feeling he was being examined like some prize goods offered for trade , and he flushed to find himself wondering if he measuredup . She looked Thonolan over next , motioned for him to stand , then turned her attention back to Jondalar . His pink flush turned to deep crimson when the meaning of her next gesture dawned on him . She wanted to see his manhood . He shook his head and gave the grinning Thonolan a dirty look . At a word from the woman , one of the men grabbed Jondalar from behind , while another , with obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think she 's in any mood for objections , " Thonolan said , smirking . Jondalar angrily shrugged off the man who was holding him and exposed himself to the old woman 's view , glowering at his brother who was hanging on to his sides , snorting , in a futile attempt to constrainhis glee . The old woman looked at him , cocked her head to one side , and , with a gnarled finger , touched him . Jondalar 's crimson turned to purple when , for some inexplicable reason , he felt his manhood swell . The woman cackled , and there were sniggers from the men standing nearby , but a strangely subduednote of awe as well . Thonolan burst out in loud guffaws , stompingand bending over double as tears came to his eyes . Jondalar hastily covered his offending member , feeling foolish and angry . " Big Brother , you must really need a woman to get a rise over that old hag , " Thonolan quipped , catching his breath and wiping away a tear . Then he burst into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your turn next , " Jondalar said , wishing he could think of some witty remark to squelch him . The old woman signaled to the leader of the men who had stopped them , and spoke to him . A heated exchange followed . Jondalar heard the woman say " Zelandonyee " and saw the young man point to the meat drying on cords . The exchange ended abruptly with an imperiouscommand from the woman . The man shot a dark glance at Jondalar , then motioned to a curly-haired youth . After a few words , the young man dashed away at full speed . The two brothers were led back to their tent and their backframes were returned , but not their spears or knives . One man was always a short distance away , obviously keeping an eye on them . Food was brought to them , and , when night fell , they crawled into their tent. 58 59Thonolan was in high spirits , but Jondalar was in no mood for con- versation with a brother who laughed every time he looked at him . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awoke . About midmorning a large party arrived , amid shouts of greeting . Tents were set up , men , women , and children settled in , and the spartan camp of the two men began to take on aspects of a Summer Meeting . Jondalar and Thonolan watched with interest the assembly of a large structure , circular , with straight walls covered with hides , and a domed , thatched roof . The various parts of it were pre- assembled , and it went up with surprising speed . Then bundles and covered baskets were carried inside . There was a lull in activities while food was prepared . In the after- noon , a crowd began to gather around the large circular structure . The old woman 's log was brought and placed just outside the open- ing , and the fur robe draped over it . As soon as she appeared , the crowd quieted and formed a circle around her , leaving the place in the center open . Jondalar and Thonolan watched her speak to a man and point to them . " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her again , " Thonolan gibed as the man beckoned . " They 'll have to kill me first ! " " You mean you 're not dying to bed that beauty ? " Thonolan asked , feigning wide-eyed innocence . " It certainly looked that way yester- day . " He began to chuckle again . Jondalar turned and stalked off to- ward the group . They were led to the center and she motioned for them to sit in front of her again . " Zel-an-don-yee ? " the old woman said to Jondalar . " Yes . " He nodded . " I am Jondalar of the Zelandonii . " She tapped the arm of an old man beside her . " I . . . Tamen , " he said , then some words Jondalar could n't under- stand , " . . . Hadumai . Long time . . . Tamen . . . " another un- familiar word , " west . . . Zelandonii . " Jondalar strained , then suddenly realized he had understood some of the man 's words . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . . . long time ago you . . . west . . . made a Journey ? to the Zelandonii ? Can you speak Zelandonii ? " he asked excitedly . " Journey , yes , " the man said . " No talk . . . long time . " The old woman grabbed the man 's arm and spoke to him . He turned back to the two brothers . " Haduma , " he said , pointing to her . " . . . Mother . . . " Tamen hesitated , then indicated everyone with a sweep of his arm . " You mean like Zelandoni , One Who Serves the Mother ? " He shook his head . " Haduma . . . Mother . . . " He thought for a moment , then beckoned to some people and lined them up in a row beside him . " Haduma . . . mother . . . mother . . . mother .. . mother , " he said , pointing first at her , then to himself , then to each person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sense out of the demonstration . Tamen was old , but not as old as Haduma . The man next to him was just past middle age . Beside him was a younger woman holding the hand of a child . Suddenly , Jondalar made a connection . " Are you saying Haduma is mother 's mother five times ? " He held up his hand with five fingers outstretched . " The mother of five generations ? " he said with awe . The man nodded vigorously . " Yes , mother 's mother . . . five .. . generations , " he said , pointing again to each person . " Great Mother ! Do you know how old she must be ? " Jondalar said to his brother . " Great mother , yes , " Tamen said . " Haduma . . . mother . " He pattedhis stomach . " Children ? " " Children . " He nodded . " Haduma mother children . . . " He began drawing lines in the dirt . " One , two , three . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Sixteen ! Haduma gave birth to sixteen children ? " Tamen nodded , pointing again to the marks on the ground . " ... Many son . . . many ... girl ? " He shook his head , doubtful . " Daughters ? " Jondalar offered . Tamen brightened . " Many daughters . . . " He thought for a moment . " Live ... all live . All . . . many children . " He held up one hand and one finger . " Six Caves . . . Hadumai . " " No wonder they were ready to kill us if we so much as looked cross at her , " Thonolan said . " She 's the mother of all of them , a living First Mother ! " Jondalar was as impressed , but even more puzzled . " I am honored to know Haduma , but I do n't understand . Why are we being held ? And why did she come here ? " The old man pointed to their meat drying on cords , then to the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . hunt . Jeren make . . . " Tamen drew a circle on the ground with two diverging61lines making a broad V from the small space left open . " Zelandonii man make . . . make run . . . " He thought for a long time , then smiled and said , " Make run horse . " - " So that 's it ! " Thonolan said . " They must have built a surround and were waiting for that herd to move closer . We chased them off . " " I can understand why he was angry , " Jondalar said to Tamen . " But we did n't know we were on your hunting grounds . We 'll stay and hunt , of course , to make restitution . It 's still no way to treat Visitors . Does n't he understand passage customs for those on a Journey ? " he said , venting his own anger . The old man did n't catch every word , but enough to understand the meaning . " Not many Visitors . Not . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . forget . " " Well , you ought to remind him . You were on a Journey , and he might want to make one someday . " Jondalar was still annoyed at their treatment , but he did n't want to make too much of an issue about it . He still was n't sure what was going on and he did n't want to actually offend them . " Why did Haduma come ? How can you allow her to make a long trip at her age ? " Tamen smiled . " Not . . . allow Haduma . Haduma say . Jeren .. . find dumai . Bad . . . bad luck ? " Jondalar nodded to indicate the correctnessof the word , but he did n't understand what Tamen was trying to say . " Jeren give . . . man . . . runner . Say Haduma make bad luck go . Haduma come . " " Dumai ? Dumai ? You mean my donii ? " Jondalar said , taking the carved stone figurine out of his pouch . The people around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hand . An angry murmurrose from the crowd , but Haduma harangued them and they quieted . " But this donii is good luck ! " Jondalar protested . " Good luck . . . woman , yes . Man . . . " Tamen searched his memory for a word , " . . . sacrilege , " he said . Jondalar sat back , stunned . " But if it 's good luck for a woman , why did she throw it ? " He made a violent gesture of casting the donii down , bringing exclamations of concern . Haduma spoke to the old man . " Haduma . . . long time live . . . big luck . Big . . . magic . Haduma say me Zelandonii . . . customs . Say Zelandonii man not Hadumai . . . . Haduma say Zelandonii man bad ? " Jondalar shook his head . Thonolan spoke up . " I think he 's saying she was testing you , Jondalat .. She knew the customs were not the same , and she wanted to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dishonor , yes , " Tamen interrupted , hearing the word . " Haduma ... know not all man , good man . Want know Zelandonii man dishonorMother . " " Listen , that 's a very special donii , " Jondalar said , a little indignant . " It 's very old . My mother gave it to m  --  t 's been handed down for generations . " " Yes , yes . " Tamen nodded vigorously . " Haduma know . Wise .. . much wise . Long time live . Big magic , make bad luck go . Haduma know Zelandonii man , good man . Want Zelandonii man . Want .. . honor Mother . " Jondalar saw the grin lighting up Thonolan 's face , and squirmed . " Haduma want , " Tamen pointed to Jondalar 's eyes , " blue eyes . Honor Mother . Zelandonii . . . spirit make child , blue eyes . " " You did it again , Big Brother ! " Thonolan blurted , grinning with malicious delight . " With those big blue eyes of yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to hold his laughter in , afraid it might offend , but unable to stop . " Oh , Mother ! I can hardly wait to get back home and tell them . Jondalar , the man every woman wants ! Do you still want to go back ? For this , I 'd give up the end of the river . " He could n't talk anymore . He was doubled over , pounding the ground , holding his sides and trying not to laugh out loud . Jondalar swallowed several times . " Ah . . . I . . . urn . . . does Haduma think the Great Mother . . . ah . . . could still . . . bless her with a child ? " Tamen looked at Jondalar , perplexed , and at Thonolan 's contortions . Then a big grin cracked his face . He spoke to the old woman , and the whole camp erupted into raucous laughter , the old woman 's cackle heard above all . Thonolan , with a heave of relief , let out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . Jondalar did not see anything funny . The old man was shaking his head , trying to talk . " No , no , Zelandoniiman . " He beckoned to someone . " Noria , Noria ... " A young woman stepped forward and smiled shyly at Jondalar . She was hardly more than a girl , but showed the fresh sparkle of new womanhood . The laughter finally subsided . " Haduma big magic , " Tamen said . " Haduma bless . Noria five . . . generations . " He held up five fingers . " Noria make child , make . . . six generations . " He held up another finger . " Haduma want Zelan-62 63donii man . . . honor Mother . . . " Tamen smiled as he remembered the words , " First Rites . " The worry lines on Jondalar 's forehead smoothed out , and the beginnings of a smile turned up the corners of his mouth . " Haduma bless . Make spirit go Noria . Noria make . . . baby , Zelandonii eyes . " Jondalar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looked at his brother . Thonolan was not laughing any more . " Do you still want to go home and tell everyone about the old hag I bedded ? " he asked . He turned to Tamen . " Please tell Haduma it will be my pleasure to honor the Mother and share Noria 's First Rites . " He smiled warmly at the young woman . She smiled back , tentatively at first , but , bathed in the unconscious charisma of his vivid blue eyes , her smile grew . Tamen spoke to Haduma . She nodded , then motioned for Jondalar and Thonolan to stand , and looked the tall blond man over carefully again . The warmth of his smile still lingered , and when Haduma looked into his eyes , she chuckled softly and went into the large circulartent . The people were still laughing and talking about the misunderstandingas the crowd broke up . The two brothers stayed to talk to Tamen ; even his limited ability to communicate was better than none at all . " When did you visit the Zelandonii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cave it was ? " " Long time , " he said . " Tamen young man , like Zelandonii man . " " Tamen , this is my brother , Thonolan , and my name is Jondalar , Jondalar of the Zelandonii . " " You . . . welcome , Thonolan , Jondalar . " The old man smiled . " I , Tamen , three generation Hadumai . No talk Zelandonii long time . Forget . No talk good . You talk , Tamen . . . ? " " Remember ? " Jondalar suggested . The man nodded . " Third generation ? I thought you were Haduma 's son , " Jondalar added . " No . " He shook his head . " Want make Zelandonii man knowHaduma , mother . " " My name is Jondalar , Tamen . " " Jondalar , " he corrected . " Tamen not Haduma son . Haduma makedaughter . " He held up one finger with a questioning look . " One daughter ? " Jondalar said . Tamen shook his head . " First daughter ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make first son . " He pointed to himself . " Tamen . Tamen . . . mate ? " Jondalar nodded . " Tamen mate to mother , Noria mother . " " I think I understand . You are the first son of Haduma 's first daughter , and your mate is Noria 's grandmother . " " Grandmother , yes . Noria make . . . big honor Tamen . . . six generation . " " I am honored , too , to be chosen for her First Rites . " " Noria make . . . baby , Zelandonii eyes . Make Haduma .. . happy . " He smiled remembering the word . " Haduma say big Zelandoniiman make . . . big . . . strong spirit , make strong Hadumai . " " Tamen , " Jondalar said , his forehead knotted . " Noria might not make a baby of my spirit , you know . " Tamen smiled . " Haduma big magic . Haduma bless , Noria make . Big magic . Woman no children . Haduma . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Touch ? " Jondalar provided the word , feeling his ears warm . " Haduma touch , woman make baby . Woman no . . . milk . Haduma touch , woman make milk . Haduma make Jondalar . . . big honor . Many man want Haduma touch . Make long time man . Make man . . . pleasure ? " They all smiled . " Pleasure woman , all time . Many woman , many time . Haduma big magic . " He paused , and his face lost its smile . " No make Haduma . . . anger . Haduma bad magic , anger . " " And I laughed , " Thonolan said . " Do you suppose I could get her to touch me ? You and your big blue eyes , Jondalar . " " Little Brother , the only magic touch you ever needed was the invitinglook of a pretty woman . " " So . I never noticed you needing help . Look who 's sharing First Rites ? Not your little brother with his dull gray eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and he 's going to spend the night alone . Not on your life . " They laughed , and Tamen , who caught the drift of the banter , joined in . " Tamen , maybe you 'd better tell me about your customs for First Rites , " Jondalar said , more serious . " Before you get into that , " Thonolan said , " can you get our spears and knives back ? I 've got an idea . While my brother is busy beguiling that young beauty with his big blue eyes , I think I know a way to make your angry hunter happier . " " How ? " Jondalar asked . " With a grandmother , of course . " Tamen looked confused , but he shrugged it off as problems with the language . Jondalar saw little of Thonolan that evening or the next day ; he was too busy with the purification rituals . The language was a barrier to understanding even with Tamen 's help , and when he was alone with the scowling older women , it was worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxed , and he was sure she smoothed over some unforgivable blunders . Haduma did n't rule the people , but it was obvious they would refuseher nothing . She was treated with benevolent reverence and a little fear . It had to be magic that she had lived so long and retained her full mental faculties . She had a knack for sensing when Jondalar was in difficulty . On one occasion , when he was sure he had unknowinglybroken some taboo , she waded in , eyes flashing anger , and beat the backs of several retreating women with her staff . She would brook no opposition to him ; her sixth generation would have Jondalar'sblue eyes . In the evening , when he was finally led to the large circular structure , he was n't even sure it was time , until he went inside . As he stepped through the entrance , he paused to look around . Two stone lamps , with bowl-shaped wells filled with fat in which wicks of dried moss burned , lit one side . The ground was covered with furs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Behinda raised platform covered with furs hung the thick white fur of an albino horse decorated with the red heads of immature great spottedwoodpeckers . Sitting on the very edge of the platform was Noria , nervously staring down at her hands in her lap . On the other side , a small section was partitioned off with hanging leather hides marked with esoteric symbols , and a screen of thongs ? one of the hides cut into narrow strips . Someone was behind the screen . He saw a hand move a few of the strips aside , and looked into Haduma 's wrinkled old face for a brief moment . He breathed a sigh of relief . There was always at least one guardian , to bear witness that a girl 's transformation to full womanhood was complete , and to make sure a man was n't unduly rough . As a stranger , he had felt some concern that there might be a bevy of disapproving guardians . With Haduma he felt no qualms . He did n't know if he should greet her or ignore her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed . When Noria saw him , she stood up . He walked toward her , smiling . She was rather small , with soft , light brown hair hanging loosely around her face . She was barefoot , and a skirt of some woven fiber was tied at the waist and fell to below her knees in colorful bands . A shirt of soft deerskin embroidered with dyed quills was laced together tightly up the front . It conformed to her body enough to reveal thather womanhood was well established , though she had not lost all her girlish roundness . She got a frightened look in her eye as he approached , though she tried to smile . But when he made no sudden moves , just sat down on the edge of the platform and smiled , she seemed to relax a little , and sat down beside him , far enough away so that their knees did not touch . It would help if I could speak her language , he thought . She 's so scared . No wonder , I 'm a total stranger to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protective , and a few twinges of excitement . He noticed a carved wooden bowl and some drinking cups on a nearby stand and started to reach , but Noria saw his intention and jumped up to fill the cups . As she gave him a cup of amber liquid , he touched her hand . It startled her . She pulled it back a little , then left it . He gave her hand a gentle squeeze , then took the cup and drank . The liquid had the sweet , strong taste of something fermented . Not unpleasant , but he was n't sure how strong it was , and decided to drink lightly . " Thank you , Noria , " he said , putting the cup down . " Jondalar ? " she asked , looking up . By the light of the stone lamps he could tell her eyes were a light shade , but he was n't sure if they were gray or blue . " Yes , Jondalar . Of the Zelandonii . " " Jondalar . . . Zelandonyee man . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Woman , " he said , touching one firm young breast . She jumped back . Jondalar untied the lace at the neck of his tunic and pulled it back , showing a chest of light curls . He smiled a wry grin and touched his chest . " No woman . " He shook his head . " Man . " She giggled a little . " Noria woman , " he said , slowly reaching toward her breast again . This time she let him touch without pulling back , and her smile was more relaxed . " Noria woman , " she said , then got a mischievous glint in her eye , and pointed a finger toward his groin , but did n't touch . " Jondalar man . " Suddenly she looked frightened again , as though she might have gone too far , and got up to refill the cups . She scooped out the liquid nervously , spilling some , and seemed embarrassed . Her hand shook holding the cup to him. 66 67 He steadied her hand , took the cup and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he held the cup to her mouth so that she had to cup her hands around his to tip it up to drink . When he put the cup down , he reached for her hands again , opened her palms , and kissed each one lightly . Her eyes opened wide with surprise , but she did n't pull back . He moved his hands up her arms , then bent closer and kissed her neck . She was tense , with anticipation as well as fear , wait- ing to see what he would do next . He moved closer , kissed her neck again , and his hand slipped down to cup one breast . Though she was still afraid , she was beginning to feel her own responses to his touch . He tilted her head back , kissing her neck , flicked his tongue along her throat , and reached to untie the lace at her neck . Then he moved his lips up to her ear and along her jaw , and found her mouth . He opened his , and moved his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he exerted gentle pressure to open them more . Then he backed off holding her shoulders , and smiled . Her eyes were closed , but her mouth was still open , and she was breathing faster . He kissed her again , cupping a breast , then reached up to pull the lace out of one hole . She stiffened a little . He stopped and looked at her , then smiled and deliberately pulled the lace out of another hole . She sat stiffly unmoving , looking up at his face as he pulled the lace out of yet another hole , and then another , until the deerskin shirt hung loosely , open all down the front . He bent down to her neck as he pushed the shirt back to bare her shoulders and reveal her upright young breasts with their swollen areolas , and felt his manhood throb . He kissed her shoulders with open mouth and moving tongue and felt her quiver , and caressed her arms as he pushed her shirt off . He ran his hands up her spine , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , felt her nipple contract , and sucked gently . She gasped but did n't pull away . He suckled the other breast , ran his tongue back up to her mouth and , as he kissed her , pushed her back . She opened her eyes and looked up at him from the furs . Her eyes were dilated and luminous . His were so deeply blue and compelling that she could not look away . " Jondalar man , Noria woman , " she said . " Jondalar man , Noria woman , " he said huskily , then sat up and pulled his tunic over his head , feeling the surge as his manhood strained to burst free . He bent over her , kissed her again , and felt her open her mouth to taste his tongue with hers . He caressed her breast and ran his tongue down her neck and shoulder . He found her nipple again , sucking harder as he heard her moan , and felt his own breath heaving faster . It 's been so long since I 've been with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that instant . Go easy , do n't scare her , he reminded himself . It 's her first time . You 've got all night , Jondalar . Wait until you know she 's ready . He caressed her bare skin below her swelling mounds down to her waist , and searched for the thong that gathered her skirt together . Pulling the tie , he reached in and rested his hand on her stomach . She tensed , then relaxed . He reached lower for the inside of her thigh , brushing over her pubic rise of soft down . She spread her legs as he moved his hand along her inner thigh . He pulled his hand away , sat up , then worked her skirt down belowher hips and dropped it on the ground . Then he stood up and looked at her soft , rounded , not quite full-blown curves . She smiled up at him with a look of trust and longing . He untied the thong from his trousers and lowered them . She gasped when she saw his upright swollen member , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had listened with fascination to stories other women told of their Rites of First Pleasures . Some women did n't think they were such a pleasure . They said the Gift of Pleasure was given to men , that women were given the ability to give men pleasure so men would be bound to them ; so men would hunt and bring food and skins to make clothes when a woman was heavy with child or suckling young . Noria had been warned there would be pain in her First Rites . Jondalar was so swollen , so big , how would he fit himself in her ? Her look of fear was familiar . It was a critical moment ; she would have to get used to him again . He enjoyed awakening a woman for the first time to the pleasures of the Mother 's Gift , but it took delicacy and finesse . Someday , he thought , I wish I could give a woman pleasurefor the first time and not have to worry about hurting her . He knew it was n't possible . The Rites of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sat down beside her and waited , giving her time . Her eyes were drawn to his throbbing member . He took her hand and led her to touch him , and felt a surge . It was as though his manhood had a life of its own at a time like this . Noria felt the softness of his skin , the warmth , the firm fullness , and , as his member moved eagerly in her hand , she felt a sharp , pleasurable , tingling sensation within her , and a dampness between her legs . She tried to smile , but fear still lurked in her eyes . He stretched out beside her and kissed her gently . She opened hereyes and looked into his . She saw his concern , and his hunger , and some unnamable , irresistible force . She was drawn , overwhelmed , lost in the impossibly blue depths of his eyes , and felt the deep , pleasurablesensation again . She wanted him . She feared pain , but she wanted him . She reached for him , closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer to him . He kissed her , letting her explore his mouth , and slowly worked his way down her neck and throat , kissing , moving his tongue , and gently caressing her stomach and thighs . He tantalized a little , coming close to the sensitive nipple , but backing off , until she moved his mouth to it . At that instant , he moved his hand to the warm slit between her thighs and found the small throbbing nodule . A cry escapedher lips . He suckled and gently bit her nipple as he moved his finger . She moaned and moved her hips . He went lower , felt her indrawn breath as his tongue found her navel , and tension in her muscles as he moved even lower , backing off the platform until his knees felt the ground . Then he pressed her legs apart , and took his first taste of her tangy salt . Noria 's breath exploded with a shuddering cry . She moaned with each breath , tossed her head back and forth , and raised her hips to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , licked her warm folds , then found her nodule with his tongue and worked it . As she cried out , moving her hips , his own excitement was hard upon him . He struggled to contain it . When he heard her gasping in quick pants , he raised up , still kneeling so he could control his penetration , and guided the head of his engorged organ into her untried opening . He gritted his teeth for control as he pushed into the warm , damp , tight well . As she wrapped her legs around his waist , he felt the blockage within her . With his finger , he found her nodule again and moved himself back and forth just a little , until her gasps came with cries and he felt her hips lift . Then , he drew back , pushed hard , and felt himselfpenetrate the barrier as she cried out in pain and pleasure , and heard his own strained outcry as he released his pent-up need with shuddering spasms . He moved out and in a few more times , penetrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his essence drained , then collapsed on her . It was over . He lay for a moment with his head on her chest , breathing hard , then raised himself . She was limp , her head turned to the side , her eyes closed . He withdrew himself and saw bloodstains on the white fur beneath her . He lifted her legs back onto the platform and crawled up on it beside her , sinking into the furs . As his breath started to come easier , he felt hands on his head . He opened his eyes to see the old face and bright eyes of Haduma . Noria moved beside him . Haduma smiled , nodded with approval , and began a singsong chant . Noria opened her eyes , was pleased to see the old woman , and even more pleased when she moved her hands from Jondalar'shead to her stomach . Haduma made motions over them , chanting , then pulled out the bloodstained fur from beneath them . There was special magic for a woman in her blood of First Rites . Then the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knobby finger to touch his spent member . He felt a moment of renewed excitement , saw it try to spring to life again , then go soft . Haduma chuckled softly , then hobbled out of the tent , leaving them alone . Jondalar relaxed beside Noria . After a while , she sat up and looked down at him with glowing , languorous eyes . " Jondalar man , Noria woman , " she said , as though she truly felt she was a woman now , and leaned over to kiss him . He was surprised to feel a stir of excitement so soon , and wondered if Haduma 's touch had anything to do with it . He forgot to wonder as he took his time showing the eager young woman ways to please him , and giving new pleasure to her . The giant sturgeon was already beached by the time Jondalar got up . Thonolan had poked his head in the tent earlier , showing him a couple of gaffs , but Jondalar had waved him off , wrapped his arm around Noria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , Noria was gone . He slipped on his trousers and walked toward the river . He watched Thonolan , Jeren , and several others laughing in newfound camaraderie , rather wishing he had fished with them . " Well , look who decided to get up , " Thonolan said when he saw him . " Leave it to blue eyes to lie around while everyone else is fightingto haul that old Haduma out of the water . " Jeren caught the phrase . " Haduma ! Haduma ! " he shouted , laughing and pointing at the fish . He pranced around it , then stood in front of its primitive , sharklike head . The feelers sprouting out of the lower jaw attested to its bottom-feeding habits and harmlessness , but its size alone had made it a challenge . It was well over fifteen feet long . With a roguish grin , the young hunter moved his pelvis back and forth in erotic mimicry at the nose of the great old fish , shouting , " Haduma ! Haduma ! " as though begging to be touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bawdy laughter , and even Jondalar smiled . The others started dancing around the fish , shaking their pelvises and shouting " Haduma ! " and , with high spirits , began pushing each other aside , vying for the spot at the head . One man was shoved into the river . He waded back , grabbed the nearest one , and pulled him in . Soon they were all pushing each other into the water , Thonolan right in the thick of it . He splashed up on the bank soaking wet , spied his brother , and grabbed him . " Do n't think you 're going to get away dry ! " he said as Jondalar resisted . " Come on , Jeren , let 's give blue eyes a dunking ! " Jeren heard his name , saw the struggle , and came running . The others followed . Pulling and pushing , they dragged Jondalar to the river 's edge , and all ended up in the water , laughing . They came out dripping , still grinning , until one of them noticed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eh ? " she said , fixing them with a severe stare . They gave each other surreptitious glances and looked sheepish . Then she cackled delightedly , stood at the head of the fish , and wagged her old hips back and forth . They laughed and ran toward her , each man getting down on hands and knees and begging her to get on his back . Jondalar smiled at the game they had obviously played with her before . Her tribe not only revered their ancient ancestress , they loved her , and she seemed to enjoy their fun . Haduma looked around and , seeing Jondalar , pointed at him . The men waved him over , and he noticed the care with which they helped her onto his back . He stood up carefully . She weighed almost nothing , but he was surprised at the strength of her grip . The fragile old woman still had a certain toughness . He started walking , but the rest were racing ahead , and she pounded his shoulder , urging him on . They ran up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then Jondalar got down to let her off . She straightened herself , found her staff , and , with great dignity , headed toward the tents . " Can you believe that old woman ? " Jondalar said to Thonolan with admiration . " Sixteen children , five generations , and she 's still going strong . I do n't doubt that she will live to see her sixth generation . " " She live see six generation , then she die . " Jondalar turned at the voice . He had n't seen Tamen approach . " What do you mean , then she die ? " " Haduma say , Noria make blue-eye son , Zelandonii spirit , then Haduma die . She say , long time here , time go . See baby , then die . Baby name , Jondal , six generation Hadumai . Haduma happy Zelandoniiman . Say good man . Pleasure woman First Rites not easy , Zelandonii man , good man . " Jondalar was filled with mixed emotions . " If it is her wish to go , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Yes , all Hadumai much sad , " Tamen said . " Can I see Noria again , so soon after First Rites ? Just for a while ? I do n't know your customs . " " Custom , no . Haduma say yes . You go soon ? " " If Jeren says the sturgeon pays our obligation for chasing off the horses , I think we should . How did you know ? " " Haduma say . " The camp feasted on sturgeon in the evening , and many hands had made short work of cutting strips for drying earlier in the afternoon . Jondalar glimpsed Noria once from a distance as she was escorted by several women to some place farther upstream . It was after dark beforeshe was led to see him . They walked together toward the river , with two women following discreetly behind . It broke custom enough for her to see him immediately after First Rites ; alone would be too much . They stood by a tree not saying anything , her head bowed . He moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at him . She had tears in her eyes . Jondalar wiped a glistening drop from the corner of her eye with a knuckle , then brought it to his lips . " Oh . . . Jondalar , " she cried , reaching for him . He held her , kissed her gently , then more passionately . " Noria , " he said . " Noria woman , beautiful woman . " " Jondalar maki . Noria woman , " she said . " Make . . . Noria .. . Make . . . " She heaved a sob , wishing she knew the words to tell him what she wanted to say . " I know , Noria . I know , " he said , holding her . Then he stood back holding her shoulders , smiled at her and patted her stomach . She smiled through her tears . " Noria make Zelandonyee . . . . " She touched his eyelid . " Noria make Jondal . . . Haduma .... " " Yes . " He nodded . " Tamen told me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have something I want to give you , Noria . " He took out the stone donii and put it in her hand . He wished there were some way to tell her how special it was to him , to tell her his mother had given it to him , to tell her how old it was , how it had been passed down for many generations . Then he smiled 73 " This donii is my Haduma , " he said . " Jondalar 's Haduma . Now , it is Noria 's Haduma . " " Jondalar Haduma ? " she said with wonder , looking at the carved female shape . " Jondalar Haduma , Noria ? " He nodded , and she burst into tears , clutched it in both hands , and brought it to her lips . " Jondalar Haduma , " she said , her shoulders shaking with sobs . Suddenly she threw her arms around him and kissed him , then ran back toward the tents , crying so hard that she could barely see her way . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was standing beside Noria when Jondalar stopped in front of them . Haduma was smiling , nodding approval , but tears were rolling down Noria 's cheeks . He reached for one , brought it to his mouth , and she smiled , though it did n't check her tears . He turned to go , but not before he saw the curly-haired young man Jeren had sent as a runner looking at Noria with lovesick eyes . She was a woman now and blessed by Haduma , assured of bringing a lucky child to a man 's hearth . It was common talk that she had known pleasure at First Rites , and everyone knew such women made the best mates . Noria was eminently matable , utterly desirable . " Do you really think Noria is pregnant with a child of your spirit ? " Thonolan asked after they left the camp behind . " I 'll never know , but that Haduma is a wise old woman . She knows more than anyone can guess . I think she does have big magic . ' If anyone could make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence beside the river for a while , then Thonolan said , " Big Brother , there 's something I 'd like to ask you . " " Ask away . " " What magic do you have ? I mean , every man talks about being chosen for First Rites , but it really scares a lot of them . I know a couple who have turned it down , and to be honest , I always feel clumsy . I 'd never turn it down , though . But you , you get chosen all the time . And I 've never seen it fail . They all fall in love with you . How d  --  ou do it ? I 've watched you rut around at festivals ; I ca n't see anything special . " " I do n't know , Thonolan , " he said , a little embarrassed . " I just try to be careful . " " What man does n't ? It 's more than that . What was it Tamen said ? Pleasure woman First Rites not easy . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm just happy if I do n't hurt her too much . And it's74not like you 're undersized or anything to make it easier . Come on , give your little brother some advice . I would n't mind a bunch of young beauties following me around . " He slowed and looked at Thonalan . " Yes you would . I think that 's one of the reasons I got myself promised to Marona , so I 'd have an excuse . " Jondalar 's forehead furrowed . " First Rites are special for a woman . They are for me , too . But a lot of young women are still girls in some ways . They have n't learned the difference between running after boys and inviting a man . How do you tactfully tell a young woman , whom you 've just spent a very special night with , that you 'd rather relax with a more experienced woman , when she 's cornered you alone ? Great Doni , Thonolan ! I do n't want to hurt them , but I do n't fall in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't fall in love at all , Jondalar . " Jondalar started walking faster . " What do you mean ? I 've loved a lot of women . " " Loved them , yes . That 's not the same thing . " " How would you know ? Have you ever been in love ? " " A few times . Maybe it has n't lasted , but I know the difference . Look , Brother , I do n't want to pry , but I worry about you , especially when you get moody . And you do n't have to run . I 'll shut up if you want me to . Jondalar slowed down . " So , maybe you 're right . Maybe I 've never fallen in love . Maybe it 's not in me to fall in love . " " What 's missing ? What do n't the women you know have ? " " If I knew , do n't you think . . . " he began angrily . Then he paused . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I want a woman like she is at First Rite  --  think I fall in love with every woman then , at least for that night . But I want a woman , not a girl . I want her honestly eager and willing without any pretenses , but I do n't want to have to be so careful with her . I want her to have spirit , to know her own mind . I want her young and old , naive and wise , all at the same time . " " That 's a lot to want , Brother . " " Well , you asked . " They walked in silence for a while . " How old would you say Zelandoni is ? " Thonolan asked . " A little younger than Mother , maybe ? " Jondalar stiffened . " Why ? " " They say she was really beautiful when she was younger , even just a few years ago . Some of the older men say no one could compare to her , not even come close . It 's hard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be First among Those Who Serve the Mother . Tell me75something , Big Brother . What they say about you and Zelandoni , is it true ? " Jondalar stopped and slowly turned to face his brother . " Tell me , what do they say about me and Zelandoni ? " he asked through gritted teeth . " Sorry . I just went too far . Forget I asked . " yla walked out of the cave and onto the stone ledge in front of it , rubbing her eyes and stretching . The sun was still low in the east and she shaded her eyes as she looked to see where the horses were . Checking the horses when she awoke in the morning had alreadybecome a habit , though she had been there only a few days . It made her solitary existence a little more bearable to think she was sharing the valley with other living creatures . She was becoming aware of their patterns of movement , where they went for water in the morning , the shade trees they favored in the afternoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colt whose gray coat was so light that it was almost white , except where it shaded darker along the characteristic stripe down the spine and the dark gray lower legs and stiff standing mane . And there was the dun mare with her hay-colored foal , whose coat matched the stallion 's . And then the proud leader himself , whose place would someday be taken by one of those yearlings he barely tolerated , or perhaps one of next year 's brood , or the next . The light yellow stallion , with the deep brown feral stripe , mane , and lower legs , was in his prime , and his bearing showed it . " Good morning , horse clan , " Ayla signaled , making the gesture commonly used for any greeting purpose , with a slight nuance which shaded it to a morning greeting . " I slept late this morning . You 've already had your morning drin  --  think I 'll get mine . " She ran lightly down to the stream , familiar enough with the steep path to be sure-footed on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her morning swim . It was the same wrap , but she had washed it and worked it with her scrapers to soften the leather again . Her own natural preference for order and cleanliness had been reinforced by Iza , whose large pharmacopoeia of medicinal herbs required order to avoid misuse , and who understood the dangers of dirt and filth and infections . It was one thing to accept a certain amount of grime while traveling , when it could n't be avoided . But not with a sparkling stream nearby. 76 77She ran her hands through thick blond hair that fell in waves well below her shoulders . " I 'm going to wash my hair this morning , " she motioned to no one in particular . Just around the bend she had found soaproot growing , and went to pull some roots . As she strolled back looking over the stream , she noticed the large rock jutting out of the shallows with smooth saucer-shaped depressions in it . She picked up a round stone and waded out to the rock . She rinsed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soaproot to release the rich sudsy saponin . When she had worked up the foam , she wetted her hair , rubbed it in , then washed the rest of her body and dove into the water to rinse . A large section of the jutting wall had broken off at some time in the past . Ayla climbed out on the portion that was underwater and walked across the surface that rose above the water to a place warming in the sun . A waist-deep channel on the shoreward side made the rock an island , partly shaded by an overhanging willow whose exposed roots clutched at the stream like bony fingers . She broke a twig off a small bush whose roots had found purchase in a crack , peeled it with her teeth , and used it to pull snarls out of her hair while it dried in the sun . She was staring dreamily into the water , humming under her breath , when a flicker of movement caught her eye . Suddenly alert , she looked into the water at the silvery shape of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fish since I left the cave , she thought , recalling she had n't had breakfast either . Slipping silently into the water off the far side of the rock , she swam downstream a ways , then waded toward the shallows . She put her hand in the water , letting her fingers dangle , and slowly , with infinite patience , she moved back upstream . As she approached the tree , she saw the trout with its head into the current , undulating slightly to maintain itself in its place under the root . Ayla 's eyes glistened with excitement , but she was even more cautious , placing each foot securely as she neared the fish . She moved her hand up from behind until it was just below the trout , then touched it lightly , feeling for the open gill-covers . Suddenly , she grasped the fish and , in one sure movement , lifted it out of the water and threw it on the bank . The trout flopped and struggled for a few moments , then lay still . She smiled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tickle a fish out of the water when she was a child , and she still felt almost as proud as she had the first time she succeeded . She would watch the spot , knowing it would be used by a succession of tenants . This one is big enough for more than breakfast , she thought , as she retrieved her catc  --  nticipating the taste of fresh trout baked on hot stones . As her breakfast cooked , Ayla busied herself making a basket of beargrass she had picked the day before . It was a simple , utilitarian basket , but with small variations in the weaving she created a change in texture to please herself , giving it a subtle design . She worked quickly , but with such skill that the basket would be watertight . By adding hot rocks , it could be used for a cooking utensil , but that was not the purpose she had in mind for it . She was making a storage container , thinking about everything she had to do to make herself secure for the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry in a few days , she estimated , glancing at the round red berries spread out on grass mats on her front porch . By then , more will be ripe . There will be a lot of blueberries , but I wo n't get much out of that scrawny little apple tree . The cherry tree is full , but they 're almost too ripe . If I 'm going to get some , I 'd better do it today . Sunflower seeds will be good , if the birds do n't get them all first . I think those were hazelnut bushes by the apple tree , but they 're so much smaller than the ones by the little cave , I 'm not sure . I think those pine trees are the kind with the big nuts in the cones , though . I 'll check them later . Wish that fish would cook ! I should start drying greens . And lichen . And mushrooms . And roots . I wo n't have to dry all the roots , some will keep for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more pigweed seeds ? They 're so small , it never seems like much . Grain is worth the effort , though , and some seed heads in the meadow are ripe . I 'll get cherries and grain today , but I 'm going to need more storage baskets . Maybe I can make some containers out of birchbark . Wish I had some rawhide to make those big cases . There always seemed to be extra skins around for rawhide when I lived with the clan . Now I 'd be happy if I had one more warm fur for winter . Rabbits and hamsters are n't big enough to make a good fur wrap , and they 're so lean . If I could hunt a mammoth , I 'd have plenty of fat , even enough for lamps . And nothing is as good and rich as mammoth meat . Wonder if that trout is done yet ? She moved aside a limp leaf and poked at the fish with a stick . Just a little more . It would be nice to have a little salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tastes salty , and other herbs can add flavor . Iza could make anything taste good . Maybe I 'll go out on the steppes and see if I can find some ptarmigan , and then make it the way Creb always liked it. 78 79She felt a lump in her throat thinking about Iza and Creb , and shook her head as though she were trying to stop the thoughts , or at least the impending tears . I need a drying rack for herbs and teas , and medicines , too . I could get sick . I can chop down some trees for posts , but I need fresh thongs to bind them together . Then , when they dry and shrink , it 'll hold . With all the deadfall and driftwood , I do n't think I 'll have to cut down trees for firewood , and there will be dung from the horses . It burns well when it 's dry . I 'll start bringing wood up to the cave today , and I should make some tools soon . It 's lucky I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate the trout straight off the bed of hot rocks on which it had cooked , and she thought about looking through the pile of bones and driftwood for some flat pieces of wood or bone to use for plates ; pelvic or shoulder bones worked well . She emptied her small waterbag into her cooking bowl and wished she had the waterproof stomach of a larger animal to make a more capacious waterbag for the cave . She added hot stones from the fire to start the water in her cooking bowl heating , then sprinkled some dried rosehips from her medicine bag into the steaming water . She used rosehips as a remedy for minor colds , but they also made a pleasant tea . The arduous task of collecting , processing , and storing the abundanceof the valley was no deterrent ; rather , she looked forward to it . It would keep her busy ; she would n't have time to think about being lonely . She only had to preserve enough for herself , but there were no extra hands to make the task go faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season left to lay in an adequate supply . Something else bothered her , too . Sipping tea while she finished the basket , Ayla considered the requirementsshe would need to survive the long cold winter . I should have another fur for my bed this winter , she was thinking . And meat , of course . What about fat ? I should have some in winter . I could make birchbark containers much faster than baskets , if only I had some hooves , bones , and hide scraps to boil for glue . And where will I get a large waterbag ? Thongs to bind the posts for a drying rack ? I could use sinew , and intestines for storing the fat , and .. . Her rapidly moving fingers stopped . She stared into space as though seeing the vision of a revelation . I could get all that from one large animal ! Just one is all I 'd need to kill . But how ? She finished the small basket and put it inside her collecting basket , which she tied to her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrap , picked up her digging stick and sling , and headed for the meadow . She found the wild cherry tree , picked as many as she could reach , then climbed up to get more . She ate her share , too ; even overripe , they were tart-sweet . When she climbed down , she decided to get cherry bark for coughs . With her hand-axe , she chopped away a section of the tough outer bark , then scraped off the inner cambium layer with a knife . It reminded her of the time when she was a girl and had gone to collect wild cherry bark for Iza . She had spied on the men practicing with their weapons in the field . She knew it was wrong , but she was afraid they might see her leaving , and she became intrigued when old Zoug began teaching the boy to use a sling . She knew women were n't supposed to touch weapons , but when they left the sling behind , she could n't resist . She wanted to try it , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up that sling ? Would Broud have hated me so much if I had n't learned to use it ? Maybe he would n't have made me leave if he did n't hate me so much . But if he had n't hated me , he would n't have enjoyed forcing me , and maybe Durc would not have been born . Maybe ! Maybe ! Maybe ! she thought angrily . What 's the sense of thinking about what might have been ? I 'm here now , and that sling is n't going to help me hunt a big animal . For that I need a spear ! She picked her way through a stand of young aspen to get a drink and wash the sticky cherry juice off her hands . There was something about the tall , straight young trees that made her stop . She grasped the trunk of one ; then it struck her . This would work ! This would make a spear . She quailed for a moment . Brun would be furious , she thought . When he allowed me to hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a sling . He 'd .. . What would he do ? What could he do ? What more can any of them do to me , even if they knew ? I 'm dead . I 'm already dead . There 's no one here except me . Then , like a cord pulled so taut it breaks from the strain , something inside her snapped . She fell to her knees . Oh , how I wish there were someone here besides me . Someone . Anyone . I 'd even be glad to see Broud . I 'd never touch a sling again if he 'd let me go back , if he 'd let me see Durc again . Kneeling at the base of the slender aspen , Ayla buried her face in her hands , heaving and choking . Her sobs fell on indifferent ears . The small creatures of meadow and woodland only avoided the stranger in their midst and her incomprehensiblesounds . There was no one else to hear , no one to understand . While she had been traveling , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now that she had decided to stop , she had to put that hope aside , accept her solitude , and learn to live with it . The gnawing worry of survival , alone , in an unknown place through a winter of unknown severity , added to the strain . The cryingrelieved the tension . When she got up , she was shaking , but she took out her hand-axe and hacked angrily at the base of the young aspen , then attacked a second sapling . I 've watched the men make spears often enough , she said to herself as she stripped off the branches . It did n't look that hard . She dragged the poles to the field and left them while she gathered seed heads of einkorn wheat and rye for the rest of the afternoon , then dragged them back to the cave . She spent the early evening stripping bark and smoothing shafts , stopping only to cook herself some grain to have with the rest of her fish , and to spread the cherries out to dry . By the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step . She took the shafts into her cave , and , remembering how the men had done it , she measured off a length on one somewhat taller than herself and marked it . Then she put the marked section in the fire , turning the shaft to char it all around . With a notched scraper , she shaved away the blackened sectionand continued to char and scrape until the upper piece broke off . More charring and scraping brought it to a sharp , fire-hardened point . Then she started on the next one . When she finished , it was late . She was tired , and glad of it . It would bring sleep more easily . Nights were the worst time . Ayla banked her fire , walked to the opening , gazed out at the star-spattered sky , and tried to think of some reason to delay going to bed . She had dug a shallow trench , filled it with dry grass , and covered it with her fur . She walked toward it with slow steps . She lowered herself onto it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to the silence . There were no rustlings of people preparing for bed , no sounds of coupling from nearby hearths , no grunting or snoring ; none of the many small sounds of people , not a single breath of lif  --  xcept her own . She reached for the cloak she had used to carry her son on her hip , bunched it up and pressed it to her breast , and rocked back and forth crooning under her breath while tears rolled down her face . Finallyshe lay down , curled herself around the empty cloak , and cried herself to sleep . When Ayla went outside the next morning to relieve herself , there was blood on her leg . She rummaged through her small pile of belongingsfor the absorbent straps and her special waist thong . Theywere stiff and shiny despite washings , and they should have been buried the last time she used them . She wished she had some mouflon wool to pack in them . Then she spied the rabbit fur . I wanted to save that rabbit skin for winter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She cut the small skin into strips before she went down for her morning swim . I should have known it was coming , I could have planned for it . Now I wo n't be able to do anything except .. . Suddenly she laughed . The women 's curse does n't matter here . There are no men I have to avoid looking at , no men whose food I ca n't cook or gather . I 'm the only one I have to worry about . Still , I should have expected it , but the days have gone by so fast . I did n't think it was time yet . How long have I been in this valley ? She tried to remember , but the days seemed to fade into each other . She frowned . I ought to know how many days I 've been her  --  t might be later in the season than I thought . She felt a moment of panic . It 's not that bad , she reminded herself . The snow wo n't fall before the fruits ripen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should keep track of the days . She recalled when , long ago , Creb had shown her how to cut a groove in a stick to mark the passage of time . He had been surprised when she caught on so quickly ; he had only explained it to still her constant questions . He should n't have been showing a girl sacrosanct knowledge reserved for holy men and their acolytes , and he had cautionedher not to mention it . She remembered , as well , his anger another time when he caught her marking a stick to count the days between full moons . " Creb , if you 're watching me from the spirit world , do n't be angry , " she said with the silent sign language . " You must know why I need to do it . " She found a long smooth stick and made a notch in it with her flint knife . Then she thought a while and added two more . She fit her first three fingers over the notches and held them up . I think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that many . I 'll mark it again tonight , and every night . She studied the stick again . I think I 'll put a little extra knick above this one , to mark the day I started bleeding . The moon went through half its phases after she made the spears , but she still did n't know how she was going to hunt the large animal she needed . She was sitting at the opening of her cave looking at the wall across and the night sky . The summer was waxing into full heat and she was savoring the cool evening breeze . She had just completed a new summer outfit . Her full wrap was often too hot to wear , and82 83although she went naked near the cave , she needed the pouches and folds of a wrap to hold things when she went very far from it . After she had become a woman , she liked to wear a leather band wrapped tightly around her full breasts when she went hunting . It was more comfortable to run and jump . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with surreptitious glances from people who thought she was odd for wearing it . She did n't have a large hide to cut down , but she finally devised a way to wear rabbit skins , dehaired , as a summer wrap that left her bare from the waist up , and she used other skins as a breast band . She planned to make a trip to the steppes in the morning , with her new spears and hopes of finding animals to hunt . The gradual slope of the northern side of the valley gave easy access to the steppes east of the river ; the sheer wall made the western plains too difficult to reach . She saw several herds of deer , bison , horses , even a small band of saiga antelopes , but she brought back nothing more than a brace of ptarmigan and a great jerboa . She just could n't get close enough to jab anything with her spears . As the days passed , hunting a large animal was a constant preoccupation . She had often watched the men of the clan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ut they always hunted cooperatively . Their favorite technique , like that of a pack of wolves , was to cut an animal out of a herd and run it down in relays , until it was so exhausted , they could get close enough to make the fatal thrust . But Ayla was alone . They had talked sometimes of the way the cats lay in wait to pounce , or made a furious dash to bring down prey with fangs and claws . But Ayla had neither fangs nor claws , nor the short-run speed of a cat . She was n't even very comfortable handling her spears ; they were rather large to grasp and long . Yet , she had to find a way . It was the night of the new moon when she finally got an idea she thought might work . She often thought of the Clan Gathering when the moon turned its back on the earth and bathed the far reaches of space with its reflected light . The Cave Bear Festival was always held when the moon was new . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broud had led the exciting hunt dance for their clan , and the vivid re-creation of chasing a mammoth into a blind canyon with fire had won the day . But the host clan 's portrayal of digging a pit trap on the path a woolly rhinoceros usually took to water , and then surrounding it and chasing him into it , had brought them in a closesecond in that competition . Woolly rhinos were notoriously unpredictable , and dangerous . The next morning , Ayla looked to see if the horses were there , but she did n't greet them . She could identify each member of the herd individually . They were company , almost friends , but there was no other way , not if she was going to survive . She spent the greater part of the next several days observing the herd , studying their movements : where they normally watered , where they liked to graze , where they spent the nights . As she watched , a plan began to take shape in her mind . She worried over details , tried to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It took a full day to chop down small trees and brush and drag them halfway across the field , piling them up near a break in the trees along the stream . She gathered pitchy barks and limbs of fir and pine , dug through rotted old stumps for residual hard lumps that caught fire quickly , and pulled up bunches of dry grass . In the evening , she bound the lumps and pieces of pitch to branches with grass to make torches that would start quickly and burn smoky . The morning of the day she planned to start , she got out her hide tent and the aurochs horn . Then she scrounged through the pile at the foot of the wall for a flat sturdy bone and scraped one side until ittapered to a sharp edge . Then , with hopes she would need them , she lj got out every cord and thong she could find , and pulled lianas down from the trees and piled them on the rocky beach . She hauled loads of driftwood and deadfall to the beach , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , everything was ready , and Ayla paced back and forth along the beach as far as the jutting wall , checking on the herd 's movements . Anxiously , she watched a few clouds building up in the east and hoped they would not move in and obscure the moonlight she was counting on . She cooked herself some grain and picked a fewberries , but . At the last moment , she dug through the pile of driftwood and bones until she found the long humerus from the foreleg of a deerwith its knobby end . She smashed it against a large piece of mammoth p , l ivory and winced at the recoil through her arm . The long bone was undamaged ; it was a good solid club . The moon rose before the sun set . Ayla wished she knew more about hunting ceremonies , but women had always been excluded . Women brought bad luck . I never brought bad luck to myself , she thought , but I 've never tried to hunt a big animal before . I wish I knew something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her amulet , and she thought of her totem . It was her Cave Lion , after all , that had led her to hunt in the first place . That 's what Creb said . What other reason could there be for a woman to become more skilled with her chosen weapon than any man ? Her totem was too strong for a woma  --  t gave her masculine traits , Brun had thought . Ayla hoped her totem would bring her luck again . Twilight was fading into darkness when Ayla walked to the bend in the river and saw the horses finally settling down for the night . She gathered up the flat bone and the tent hide , and ran through the tall grass until she came to the break in the trees where the horses watered in the morning . The green foliage was gray in the waning daylight , and the more distant trees were black silhouettes against a sky ablaze with color . Hoping the moon would shed enough light to see , she laid the tent on the ground and began to dig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke through it , diggingwas easier with the sharpened bone shovel . When a pile of soil was mounded on the hide , she dragged it into the woods to dump it . As the hole became deeper , she laid the hide out on the bottom of the pit and hauled the dirt up with it . She felt her way more than seeing , and it was hard work . She had never dug a pit by herself before . The large cooking pits , lined with rocks and used to roast whole rumps , had always been a community effort by all the women , and this pit had to be deeper and longer . The hole was about waist high when she felt water and realized she should not ha-re dug so close to the stream . The bottom filled quickly . She was ankle deep in mud before she gave up and climbed out , breaking down one edge as she lifted out the hide . I hope it 's deep enough , she thought . It will have to b  --  he more I dig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon , surprised at how late it was . She was going to have to work fast to finish , and she was n't going to get the short rest she had planned . She ran toward the place where the brush and trees were piled , and tripped on an unseen root , falling heavily . This is no time to be careless ! she thought , rubbing her shin . Her knees and palms stung , and she was sure the slippery ooze down one leg was blood , though she could n't see it . With sudden insight , she understood how vulnerable she was , and had a moment of panic . What if I break my leg ? There 's no one here to help m  --  f anything happens . What am I doing out here at night ? 86With no fire ? What if an animal attacks ? She vividly recalled a lynx that leaped at her once , and reached for her sling , imagining glowing eyes in the night . She found the weapon still securely tucked into her waist thong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or supposed to be . If something is going to happen , it will happen . I ca n't worry now . If I do n't hurry , it will be morning before I 'm ready . She found her brush pile and began to drag the small trees toward the pit . She could n't surround the horses by herself , she had reasoned , and there were no blind canyons in the valley , but , with an intuitive leap , she got an idea . It was the stroke of genius to which her brai  --  he brain that had differentiated her from the Clan far more than had physical appearanc  --  as especially suited . If there were no canyons in the valley , she thought , perhaps she could make one . It did n't matter that the idea had been thought of before . It was new to her . She did n't think of it as a great invention . It seemed only a minor adaptation to the way Clan men hunted ; only a minor adaptationthat might , just might , enable a lone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clan would dream of hunting alone . It was a great invention , born of necessity . Ayla watched the sky anxiously as she wove branches , constructing a barrier angling out from both sides of the pit . She filled in the gaps and made it higher with brush as the stars winked out in the eastern sky . The earliest birds had started their warbling greeting and the sky was lightening when she stood back and looked over her handiwork . The pit was roughly rectangular , somewhat longer than it was wide , and muddy around the edges where the last wet loads had been hauled out . Loose piles of dirt , spilled from the hide , were strewn on the trampled grass within the triangular area defined by the two walls of brush coming together at the muddy hole . Through a gap where the pit separated the two fences , the river could be seen , reflecting the glowing eastern sky . On the other side of the rippling water , the steep southern wall of the valley loomed darkly ; only near the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the position of the horses . The other side of the valley had a more gradual slope , growing steeper toward the west as it rose to form the jutting wall in front of her cave , and leveling out to rolling grassy hills far down the valley on the east . It was still dark there , but she could see the horses beginning to move . She grabbed the hide and the flat bone shovel and raced back to the beach . The fire was down . She added wood , then fished out a hot coal with a stick and put it in the aurochs horn , grabbed the torches , the87spears , and the club , and ran back to the pit . She laid a spear down on either side of the hole , the club beside one , then loped around in a wide circle to get behind the horses before they began to move . And then , she waited . The waiting was harder than the long night of working . She was keyed up , anxious , wondering if her plan would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked over the torches , and waited . She thought of countless things she had n't thought of before , that she should have done , or done differently , and waited . She wondered when the horses were going to begin their meandering move toward the stream , thought about prodding them on , thought better of it , and she waited . The horses began to mill around . Ayla thought they seemed more nervous than usual , but she had never been this close to them , and she was n't sure . Finally , the lead mare started toward the river and the rest followed behind , stopping to graze along the way . They definitelybecame nervous as they drew nearer the river and picked up Ayla 's scent and the smell of disturbed earth . When the lead mare appeared to be veering off , Ayla decided it was time . She lit a torch with the coal , then a second from the first . When they were burning well , she started after the herd , leaving the aurochs horn behind . She ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was too far from the herd . The smell of smoke brought an instinctive fear of prairie fires . The horses picked up speed and quickly outdistanced her . They were heading toward their watering place and the brush fence , but , sensing danger , some made a break toward the east . Ayla angled in the same direction , running as fast as she could , hoping to head them off . As she drew closer , she saw more of the herd swerving to avoid the trap , and she ran into their midst yelling . They dodged around her . Ears laid back , nostrils flaring , they passed her by on either side , screaming in fear and confusion . Ayla was getting panicky , as well , afraid they were all going to get away . She was near the eastern end of the brush barrier when she saw the dun mare coming toward her . She screamed at the horse , held her torches wide , and ran straight for what seemed a sure head-on collision . At the last moment , the mare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found her escape blocked and galloped along the inside of the fence , trying to find a way out . Ayla pounded behind her , panting for breath , feeling her lungs were about to burst . The mare saw the gap with its beckoning glimpse of the river and headed for it . Then she saw the open pi  --  oo late . She gathered her88legs under her to leap over the hole , but her hooves slipped on the muddy edge . She crashed into the pit with a broken leg . Ayla dashed up , breathing hard ; she picked up a spear and stood looking at the wild-eyed mare that was screaming , tossing her head , and floundering in the mud . Ayla grasped the shaft with both hands , braced her legs , and plunged the point toward the pit . Then she realized that she had driven the spear into a flank , wounding the horse , but not mortally . She raced around to the other side , slipping on the mud and nearly falling in the hole herself . Ayla picked up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mare was neighing in confusion and pain , and , as the point of the second spear bored into her neck , she lurched forward in a last valiant effort . Then she sank back with a whinny that was more like a whimper , with two wounds and a broken leg . A hard blow with the club finally ended her pain . Realization came slowly to Ayla ; she was too dazed to comprehend her achievement yet . At the edge of the pit , leaning heavily on the club she still held and gasping for breath , she stared at the fallen mare in the bottom of the hole . The shaggy grayish coat was streaked with blood and covered with mud , but the animal did not move . Then , slowly , it filled her . An urge , like none she had ever known , rose out of her depths , grew in her throat , and burst from her mouth in a primal scream of victory . She did it ! At that moment , in a lonely valley in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desolate northern ? I. loess steppes and the wetter continental steppes to the south , a young woman stood with a bone club in her han  --  nd felt powerful . She could survive . She would survive . But her exultation was short-lived . As Ayla looked down at the horse , it suddenly occurred to her that she would never be able todrag the whole animal out of the pit ; she would have to butcher it ini the bottom of the muddy hole . And then she would have to get it back to the beach , quickly , with the whole skin in reasonably good VII condition , before too many other predators picked up the scent of blood . She would have to cut the meat into thin strips , salvage the other parts she wanted , keep the fires going , and keep watch while the meat dried . And she was already exhausted from the grueling night 's work and the anxious chase . But she was n't a man of the Clan who could relax , now that his exciting part was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the women . Ayla 's work had just begun . She89heaved a great sigh , then jumped down into the pit to slit the mare 's throat . She ran back to the beach for the tent hide and the flint tools , and , on her return , she noticed that the herd at the far end of the valley was still moving . She forgot them as she struggled in the cramped space of the pit , covered with blood and mud , hacking out hunks of meat and trying not to damage the hide any worse than it was . Carrion birds were picking shreds of meat off discarded bones when she had piled up as much meat on the tent hide as she thought she could haul . She dragged it to the beach , added fuel to the fire , and dumped her load as close as she could . She ran back dragging the empty hide , but had her sling out and stones flying before she reached the pit . She heard the yip of a fox and saw it limp away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of stones . She picked up more stones from the riverbed and took a drink before she started back to work . The stone was sure and fatal to the wolverine that had braved the heat of the fire and was trying to drag a large hunk of meat away when Ayla returned with a second load . She dragged her meat to the fire , then went back to get the glutton , hoping she 'd have time to skin it , too . Wolverine fur was particularly useful for winter wear . She added more wood to the fire and eyed the driftwood pile . She was n't as lucky with the hyena when she returned to the pit . It managed to make off with a whole shank . She had n't seen so many carnivores. in the valley since she arrived . Foxes , hyenas , wolverines had all gotten a taste of her kill . Wolves , and their fiercer , doglike relatives , dholes , paced just beyond the range of her sling . Hawks and kites were braver , only flapping wings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a lynx , or a leopard , or even a cave lion anytime . By the time she hauled the filthy hide out of the hole , the sun had passed its zenith and was starting down , but not until she had dragged her last load to the beach did she give in to her fatigue and sink to the ground . She had n't slept all night ; she had n't eaten all day ; and she did n't want to move . But the smallest of the creatures after their share of her kill finally made her get up again . The buzzing flies caused her to notice how filthy she was , and they bit . She forced herself up and walked into the stream without bothering to remove her clothes , gratefully letting the water wash over her . The river was refreshing . Afterward , she went up to her cave , spread her summer wraps out to dry , and wished she had remembered to take her sling out of her waist thong before she went into thewater . She was afraid it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it soft and flexible . She put on her full wrap and got her sleeping fur from the cave . Before she went down to the beach , she looked across the meadow from the edge of her stone porch . There were scufflings and movements near the pit , but the horses were gone from the valley . Suddenly she remembered her spears . They were still on the ground where she had left them after pulling them out of the mare . She debated with herself about going after them , almost talked herself out of it , then admitted it was better to keep two perfectly good spears than go to the work of making new ones later . She picked up her damp sling and dropped her fur on the beach as she stopped for a pouchful of stones . Drawing near the pit trap , she saw the carnage as though for the first time . The brush fence had fallen over in places . The pit was a raw wound in the earth and the grass trampled . Blood , scraps of meat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remains of the mare 's head . Kit foxes were yipping around a shaggy foreleg with a hoof still attached , and a hyena was eying her warily . A flock of kites took wing as she approached , but a wolverine stood its ground beside the pit . Only the cats were still conspicuously absent . I 'd better hurry , she was thinking as she cast a stone to make the glutton give way . I 've got to get fires going around my meat . The hyena made a whooping cackle as it backed off , staying just out of range . Get out of here , you ugly thing ! she thought . Ayla hated hyenas . Every time she saw one , she remembered the time a hyena had snatched Oga 's baby . She had n't stopped to think about the consequences ; she had killed it . She just could n't let the baby die that way . As she bent to pick up her spears , her attention was caught by movement seen through the gap in the brush barrier . Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry for you , Ayla thought . I did n't want to kill your dam , she just happened to be the one who got caught . Ayla had no feelings of guilt . There were hunters , and there were the hunted , and sometimes the hunters were hunted . She could as easily fall prey , in spite of her weapons and her fire . Hunting was a way of life . But she knew the little horse was doomed without its mother , and she felt sorry for a small and helpless animal . Ever since the first rabbit she had brought to Iza to heal , she had brought a succession of90 91small wounded animals to the cave , much to Brun 's dismay . He had drawn the line at carnivores , though . She watched the hyenas circle the little filly , who was skittishly trying to stay out of their way , looking wild-eyed and scared . With no one to take care of you , maybe it 's better to get it over with , Ayla reasoned . But when one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flank , she did n't think . She tore through the brush , slinging stones . One hyena dropped , the others dashed away . She was n't trying to kill them ; she was n't interested in the scruffy-looking spotted fur of hyenas ; she wanted them to leave the little horse alone . The foal ran away too , but not as far . It was afraid of Ayla , but more fearful of hyenas . Ayla approached the baby slowly , holding out her hand and crooningsoftly in a way that had calmed other frightened animals before . She had a natural way with animals , a sensitivity , that extended to all living creatures , developed along with her medical skills . Iza had fosteredit , seen it as an extension of her own compassion that had impelledher to pick up a strange-looking girlchild because she was hurt and hungry . The little filly reached out to sniff Ayla 's outstretched fingers . The young woman moved closer , then patted , and rubbed , and scratched the foal . When the little horse noticed something familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it woke an old aching hungerin Ayla . Poor baby , she thought , so hungry and no mother to give you milk . I do n't have any milk for you ; I did n't even have enough for Durc . She felt tears threaten and shook her head . Well , he grew strong anyway . Maybe I can think of something else to feed you . You 'll have to be weaned young , too . Come on , baby . She led the young filly toward the beach with her fingers . Just as she approached , she saw a lynx about to make off with a hunk of her hard-won meat . A cat had finally made an appearance . She reached for two stones and her sling as the skittish foal backed away , and , as the lynx looked up , she hurled the stones with force . " You can kill a lynx with a sling , " Zoug had stoutly maintained once long ago . " Do n't try anything bigger , but you can kill a lynx . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She retrieved her meat and dragged the tufted-eared cat back , too . Then she looked at the pile of meat , the mud-encrusted horsehide , the dead wolverine , and the dead lynx . Suddenly she laughed out loud . I needed meat . I needed furs . Now all I need is a few more hands , she thought . The little filly had shied away from her burst of laughter and the92smell of fire . Ayla got a thong , approached the young horse carefully again , then tied the thong around her neck and led her to the beach . She tied the other end to a bush , remembered she had forgotten her spears again , ran to get them , then went to soothe the little horse who had tried to follow her . What am I going to feed you ? she thought when the baby tried to suck her fingers again . It 's not as if I do n't have enough to do right now . She tried some grass , but the little horse did n't seem to know quite what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowl with the cold cooked grain in the bottom . Babies can eat the same kind of food as their mothers , she remembered , but it has to be softer . She added water to the bowl , mashed the grain to a fine gruel , and brought it to the foal , who only snorted and backed off when the woman put her muzzle in it . But then she licked her face and seemed to like the taste . She was hungry and went after Ayla 's fingers again . Ayla thought for a moment ; then , with the filly still sucking , she lowered her hand into the bowl . The horse sucked in a little gruel andIliltossed her head , but after a few more attempts the hungry baby seemed to get the idea . When she was through , Ayla went up to the cave , brought down more grain , and started it cooking for later . I think I 'm going to be gathering a lot more grain than I first planned . But maybe I 'll have tim  --  f I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pi moment and thought how strange the Clan would think she was , to kill a horse for food and then gather food for its baby . I can be as strange as I want . . . here , she said to herself , as she jabbed a piece of horsemeat with a sharpened stick and skewered it to cook for herself . Then she looked at the task ahead of her and set to work . She was still cutting meat into thin strips when the full moon rose and the stars winked on again . A ring of fires circled the beach , and she was grateful for the large pile of driftwood nearby . Within the circle , line after line of drying meat was stretched out . A tawny lynx fur was rolled up beside a smaller roll of coarse brown wolverine , both waiting to be scraped and cured . The freshly washed gray coat of the mare was laid out on the stones , drying alongside the horse 's stomach , which was cleaned and filled with water to keep it soft . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed intestine , a pile of hooves and bones and another of lumps of fat waiting to be rendered and poured into the intestines for storage . She had even managed to salvage a little fat from the lynx and wolverin  --  or lamps and waterproofin  --  hough she discarded the meat . She did n't much care for the taste of carnivores . Ayla looked at the last two hunks of meat , washed of mud in the93stream , and reached for one . Then she changed her mind . They could wait . She could n't ever remember being so tired . She checked her fires , piled more wood on each , then spread out her bearskin fur and rolled up in it . The little horse was no longer tied to the bush . After a second feeding , she seemed to have no desire to wander off . Ayla was almost asleep when the filly sniffed her and then lay down beside her . She did n't think at the time that the foal 's responses would wake her if any predator came too close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the young woman put her arm around the warm little animal , felt her heartbeat , heard her breath , and cuddled closer. ondalar rubbed the stubble on his chin and reached for his pack that was propped against a stunted pine . He withdrew a small packet of soft leather , untied the cords and opened the folds , and carefully examined a thin flint blade . It had a slight curvature along its length ? all blades cleaved from flint were bowed a little , it was a characteristic of the ston  --  ut the edge was even and sharp . The blade was one of several especially fine tools he had put aside . A sudden wind rattled the dry limbs of the lichen-scabbed old pine . The gust whipped the tent flap open , billowed through , straining the guy lines and tugging at the stakes , and slapped it shut again . Jondalar looked at the blade , then shook his head and wrapped it up again . " Time to let the beard grow ? " Thonolan said . Jondalar had n't noticed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " In summer it may be a bother . Itches when you swea  --  ore comfortable to shave it off . But it sure helps keep your face warm in winter , and winter is coming . " Thonolan blew on his hands , rubbing them , then squatted down by the small fire in front of the tent and held them over the flames . " I miss the color , " he said . " The color ? " " Red . There 's no red . A bush here and there , but everything else just turned yellow and then brown . Grass , leaves . " He nodded in the general direction of the open grassland behind him , then looked towardJondalar standing near the tree . " Even the pines look drab . There 's ice on puddles and the edges of streams already , and I 'm still waiting for fall . " " Do n't wait too long , " Jondalar said , moving over and hunkering down in front of the fire opposite his brother . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I thought it smelled like snow . " " Wo n't be much yet , not if rhinos and mammoths are still around . They like it cold , but they do n't like much snow . They always seem94 95 to know when a big storm is coming and head back toward the glacier in a hurry . People say , Never go forth when mammoths go north . ' It 's true for rhinos , too , but this one was n't hurrying . " " I 've seen whole hunting parties turn back without throwing a sin- gle spear , just because the woollies were moving north . I wonder how much it snows around here ? " " The summer was dry . If the winter is too , mammoths and rhinos may stay all season . But we 're farther south now , and that usually means more snow . If there are people in those mountains to the east , they should know . Maybe we should have stayed with the people who rafted us across the river . We need a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would n't mind a nice friendly cave full of beautiful women right now , " Thonolan said with a grin . " I 'd settle for a nice friendly Cave . " " Big Brother , you would n't want to spend a winter without women any more than I would . " The bigger man smiled . " Well , the winter would be a lot colder without a woman , beautiful or not . " Thonolan looked at his brother speculatively . " I 've often wondered about that , " he said . " What ? " " Sometimes there 's a real beauty with half the men trying for her , but she looks only at you . I know you are n't stupid ; you know i  --  et you pass her by and go pick out some little mouse sitting in a corner . Why ? " " I do n't know . Sometimes the mouse ' just thinks she 's not beauti- ful , because she has a mole on her cheek or thinks her nose is too long . When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the one every- body is after . Sometimes women who are n't perfect are more interest- ing ; they 've done more , or learned something . " " Maybe you 're right . Some of those shy ones blossom out , after you 've paid attention to them . " Jondalar shrugged and stood up . " We 're not going to find women , or a Cave , this way . Let 's break camp . " " Right ! " Thonolan said eagerly , then turned his back to the fire ? and froze ! " Jondalar ! " he gasped , then strained to sound casual . " Do n't do anything to attract his attention , but if you look over the tent , you 'll see your friend from this morning , or one just like him . " Jondalar peered over the top of the tent . Just on the other side , swaying from side to side as he shifted his massive tonnage from one foot to the other , was a huge , double-horned , woolly rhinoceros . With his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was nearly blind directly ahead ; his small eyes were set far back and his vision was poor to begin with . Acute hearing and a sharp sense of smell more than made up for his eyesight . He was obviously a creature of the cold . He had two coats , a soft undercoat of thick downy fur and a shaggy outer one of reddish brown hair , and beneath his tough hide was a three-inch layer of fat . He carried his head low , downward from his shoulders , and his long front horn sloped forward at an angle that barely cleared the ground as he swayed . He used it for sweeping snow away from pasturag  --  f it was n't too deep . And his short thick legs were easily mired in deep snow . He visited the grasslands of the south only briefl  --  o graze on their richer harvest and store additional fa  --  n late fall and early winterafter it became cold enough for him , but before the heavy snows . He could not stand heat , with his heavy coats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His home was the bitter-cold , crackling dry tundra and steppes near the glacier . The long , tapering , anterior horn could be put to a far more dangeroususe than sweeping snow , however , and there was nothing between the rhino and Thonolan but a short distance . " Do n't move ! " Jondalar hissed . He ducked down behind the tent and reached for his pack with the spears . " Those light spears wo n't do much good , " Thonolan said , though his back was toward him . The comment stayed Jondalar 's hand for a moment ; he wondered how Thonolan knew . " You 'd have to hit him in a vulnerable place like an eye , and that 's too small a target . You need a heavy lance for rhino , " Thonolan continued , and his brother realized he was guessing . " Do n't talk so much , you 'll draw his attention , " Jondalar cautioned . " I may not have a lance , but you do n't have a weapon at all . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " " Wait , Jondalar ! Do n't ! You 'll just make him angry with that spear ; you wo n't even hurt him . Remember when we were boys , how we used to bait rhinos ? Someone would run , get the rhino chasing him , then dodge away while someone else got his attention . Keep him runninguntil he was too tired to move . You get ready to draw his attentio  --  ' mgoing to run and try to make him charge . " " No ! Thonolan , " Jondalar yelled , but it was too late . Thonolan was sprinting . It was always impossible to outguess the unpredictable beast . Rather than charging after the man , the rhino made a rush for the tent billowing in the wind . He rammed it , gouged a hole in it , snapped thongs and got snared in them . When he disentangled himself , he decided he did n't like the men or their camp and left , trotting off harmlessly . Thonolan , glancing over his shoulder , noticed the rhino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid ! " Jondalar yelled , slamming his spear into the ground with a force that broke the wooden shaft just below the bone point . " Were you trying to get yourself killed ? Great Doni , Thonolan ! Two people ca n't bait a rhino . You have to surround him . What if he had gone after you ? What in Great Mother 's underworld am I supposed to do if you get hurt ? " Surprise , then anger flashed across Thonolan 's face . Then he broke into a grin . " You were really worried about me ! Yell all you want , you ca n't bluff me . Maybe I should n't have tried it , but I was n't going to let you make some stupid move , like going for a rhino with such a light spear . What in Great Mother 's underworld am I supposed to do if you get hurt ? " His smile grew , and his eyes lit up with the delight of a small boy who had succeeded in pulling off a trick . " Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked blank in the face of his brother 's grin . His outburst had been more relief than anger , but it took him a while to grasp that Thonolan was safe . " You were lucky . I guess we both were , " he said , expelling a long breath . " But we 'd better make a couple of lances , even if we just sharpen points for now . " " I have n't seen any yew , but we can watch for ash or alder on the way , " Thonolan remarked as he began to take down the tent . " They should work . " " Anything will work , even willow . We should make them before we go . " " Jondalar , let 's get away from this place . We need to reach those mountains , do n't we ? " " I do n't like traveling without lances , not with rhinos around . " " We can stop early . We need to fix the tent anyway . If we go , we can look for some good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhino might come back . " " And he might follow us , too . " Thonolan was always eager to start in the morning , and restless about delays , Jondalar knew . " Maybe we should try to reach those mountains . All right , Thonolan , but we stop early , right ? " Right , Big Brother . " The two brothers strode along the edge of the river at a steady , ground-covering pace , long since adjusted to each other 's step and comfortable with each other 's silences . They had grown closer , talked out each other 's heart and mind , tested each other 's strengths and weaknesses . Each assumed certain tasks by habit , and each depended on the other when danger threatened . They were young and strong and healthy , and unselfconsciously confident that they could face whatever lay ahead . They were so attuned to their environment that perception was on a subliminal level . Any disturbance that posed a threat would have found them instantly on guard . But they were only vaguely aware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind soughing through leafless limbs ; black-bottomed clouds embracing the whitewalledbreastworks of the mountains before them ; and the deep , swift river . The mountain ranges of the massive continent shaped the course of the Great Mother River . She rose out of the highland north of one glacier-covered range and flowed east . Beyond the first chain of mountainswas a level plai  --  n an earlier age the basin of an inland seaand , farther east , a second range curved around in a great arc . Where the easternmost alpine foreland of the first range met the flysch foothills at the northwestern end of the second , the river broke through a rocky barrier and turned abruptly south . After dropping down karst highlands , she meandered across grassy steppes , winding into oxbows , breaking into separate channels and rejoining again as she wove her way south . The sluggish , braided river , flowing through flat land , gave the illusion of changelessness . It was only an illusion . By the time the Great Mother River reached the uplands at the southern end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , she had received into herself the watersof the northern and eastern face of the first , massive , ice-mantled range . The great swollen Mother swept out a depression as she curled east in a broad curve toward the southern end of the second chain of peaks . The two men had been following her left bank , crossing the occasional channels and streams still rushing to meet her as they came to them . Across the river to the south the land rose in steep craggy leaps ; on their side rolling hills climbed more gradually from the river 's edge . " I do n't think we 'll find the end of Donau before winter , " Jondalar remarked . " I 'm beginning to wonder if there is one . " " There 's an end , and I think we 'll find it soon . Look how big she98 I 99is . " Thonolan waved an expansive arm toward the right . " Who would have thought she 'd get that big ? We have to be near the end . " " But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think we have . Tamen said she is as big as the Mother . " " That must be one of those stories that get bigger with the telling . You do n't really believe there 's another river like that flowing south along this plain ? " " Well , Tamen did n't say he 'd seen it himself , but he was right about the Mother turning east again , and about the people who took us across her main channel . He could be right about the Sister . I wish we 'd known the language of that Cave with the rafts ; they might have known about a tributary to the Mother as big as she is . " " You know how easy it is to exaggerate great wonders that are far away . I think Tamen 's Sister ' is just another channel of the Mother , farther east . " " I hope you 're right , Little Brother . Because if there is a Sister , we 're going to have to cross it before we reach those mountains . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a place to stay for the winter . " " I 'll believe it when I see it . " A movement , apparently at odds with the natural way of things which brought it to the level of consciousness , caught Jondalar 's attention . By the sound , he identified the black cloud in the distance , movingwith no regard for the prevailing wind , and he stopped to watch as the V-formation of honking geese approached . They swooped lower as a single entity , darkening the sky with their numbers , then broke up into individuals as they neared the ground with lowered feet and flapping wings , braking to a rest . The river swerved around the steep rise ahead . " Big Brother , " Thonolan said , grinning with excitement , " those geese would n't have set down if there was n't a marsh up ahead . Maybe it 's a lake or a sea , and I 'll wager the Mother empties into it . I think we 've reached the end of the river ! " " If we climb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jondalar 's tone was carefully neutral , but Thonolan had the impression his brother did n't quite believe him . They climbed quickly , breathing hard when they reached the top , then caught their breath in amazement . They were high enough to see for a considerable distance . Beyond the turn the Mother widened , and her waters became choppy , and , as she approached a vast expanse of water , she rolled and spumed . The larger body of water was cloudy with mud churned up from the bottom , and filled with debris . Broken100limbs , dead animals , whole trees bobbed and spun around , caught by conflicting currents . They had not reached the end of the Mother . They had met the Sister . High in the mountains in front of them , the Sister had begun as rivulets and streams . The streams became rivers that raced down rapids , spilled over cataracts , and coursed straight down the western face of the second great mountain range . With no lakes or reservoirs to check the flow , the tumultuous waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain . The only check to the turbulentSister was the glutted Mother herself . The tributary , nearly equal in size , surged into the mother stream , fighting the controlling influence of swift current . She backed up and surged again , throwing a tantrum of crosscurrents and undertows ; temporary maelstroms that sucked floating debris in a perilous spin to the bottom and spewed it up a moment later downstream . The engorgedconfluence expanded into a hazardous lake too large to see across . Fall flooding had peaked and a marshland of mud sprawled over the banks where the waters had recently receded , leaving a morass of devastation : upturned trees with roots reaching for the sky , waterlogged trunks and broken branches ; carcasses and dying fish stranded in dryingpuddles . Water birds were feasting on the easy pickings ; the near shore was alive with them . Nearby , a hyena was making short work of a stag , undisturbed by the flapping wings of black storks . " Great Mother ! " Thonolan breathed . " It must be the Sister . " Jondalar was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How are we going to get across ? " " I do n't know . We 'll have to go back upstream . " " How far ? She 's as big as the Mother . " Jondalar could only shake his head . His forehead knotted with concern . " We should have taken Tamen 's advice . It could snow any day ; we do n't have time to backtrack very far . I do n't want to be caught in the open when a big storm blows . " A sudden gust of wind caught Thonolan 's hood and whisked it back , baring his head . He pulled it on again , closer to his face , and shivered . For the first time since they had set out , he had serious doubts about surviving the long winter ahead . " What do we do now , Jondalar ? " " We find a place to make camp . " The taller brother scanned the area from their vantage point . " Over there , just upstream , near that101high bank with a stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sister ? the water should be good . " " If we tie both backframes to one log , and attach a rope to both our waists , we could swim across and not get separated . " " I know you are hardy , Little Brother , but that 's foolhardy . I 'm not sure I could swim across , much less pulling a log with everything we have . That river is cold . Only the current keeps it from freezing ? there was ice at the edge this morning . And what if we get tangled up in the branches of some tree ? We 'd get swept downstream , and maybe pulled under . " " Remember that Cave that lives close to the Great Water ? They dig out the centers of big trees and use them to cross rivers . Maybe we could ... " " Find me a tree around here big enough , " Jondalar said , flinging his arm at the grassy prairie , with only a few thin or stunted trees . " Well . . . someone told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . but that seems so flimsy . " " I 've seen them , but I do n't know how they 're made , or what kind of glue they use so they wo n't leak . And the birch trees in their region grow bigger than any I 've seen around here . " Thonolan glanced around , trying to think of some other idea that his brother could n't put down with his implacable logic . He noticed the stand of straight tall alders on the high knoll just to the south , and grinned . " How about a raft ? All we 'd have to do is tie a bunch of logs together , and there are more than enough alders on that hill . " " And one long enough , and strong enough to make a pole to reach the bottom of the river to guide it ? Rafts are hard to control even on small shallow rivers . " Thonolan 's confident grin crumpled , and Jondalar had to suppress a smile . Thonolan never could hide his feelings ; Jondalar doubted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candid nature that made him so likable . " That 's really not such a bad idea , though , " Jondalar amended , notingthe return of Thonolan 's smile , " once we get upstream far enough so there 's no danger of getting swept into that rough water . And find a place where the river widens and gets shallower , and not so fast , and where there are trees . I hope the weather holds . " Thonolan was as serious as his brother by the time the weather was mentioned . " Let 's get moving then . The tent is fixed . " " I 'm going to look over those alders first . We still need a couple of sturdy spears . We should have made them last night . " 102 " Are you still worried about that rhino ? He 's well behind us now . We need to get started so we can find a place to cross . " " I 'm going to cut a shaft , at least . " " You might as well cut one for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up his axe and examined the edge , then nodded to himself and started up the hill toward the alder grove . He looked over the trees carefully and selected a tall straight sapling . He had chopped it down , stripped the branches , and was looking for one for Thonolan when he heard a commotion . There was snuffling , grunting . He heard his brother shout , and then a sound more terrifying than anything he had ever heard : a scream of pain in his brother 's voice . The silence as his scream was cut short was even worse . " Thonolan ! Thonolan ! " Jondalar raced back down the hill , still clutching the alder shaft and clutched by cold fear . His heart pounded in his ears when he saw a huge woolly rhinoceros , as tall at the shoulders as he , pushing the limp form of a man along the ground . The animal did n't seem to know what to do with his victim now that he was down . From the depths of his fear and anger , Jondalar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff like a club , the older brother rushed the beast , careless of his own safety . One hard blow landed on the rhino 's snout , just below the large curving horn , and then another . The rhino backed off , undecided in the face of a berserk man charging him and causing him pain . Jondalar prepared to swing again , pulled back the long shaf  --  ut the animal turned . The powerful whack on his rump did n't hurt much , but it urged him on , with the tall man chasing after him . When a swing of the alder shaft whistled through the air as the animal raced ahead , Jondalar stopped and watched the rhino go , catching his breath . Then he dropped the shaft and ran back to Thonolan . His brother was lying face down where the rhino had left him . " Thonolan ? Thonolan ! " Jondalar rolled him over . There was a rip in Thonolan 's leather trousers near the groin , and a bloodstain growing larger . " Thonolan ! Oh , Doni ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , listening for a heartbeat , and was afraid he only imagined hearing it until he saw him breathing . " Oh , Doni , he 's alive ! But what am I going to do ? " With a grunt of effort , Jondalar picked up the unconscious man and stood for a moment , cradling him in his arms . " Doni , 0 Great Earth Mother ! Do n't take him yet . Let him live , 0103please . . . " His voice cracked and a huge sob welled up in his breast . " Mother . . . please . . . let him live ... " Jondalar bowed his head , sobbed into his brother 's limp shoulder a moment , then carried him back to the tent . He laid him down gently on his sleeping roll , and , with his bone-handled knife , cut away the clothing . The only obvious wound was a raw , jagged rip of skin and muscle at the top of his left leg , but his chest was an angry red , the left side swelling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribs were broken ; probably there were internal injuries . Blood was pumping out of the gash in Thonolan 's leg , collecting on the sleeping roll . Jondalar rummaged through his pack , trying to find something to sop it up with . He grabbed his sleeveless summer tunic , wadded it up , and tried to wipe up the blood on the fur , but only succeeded in smearing it around . Then he laid the soft leather on the wound . " Doni , Doni ! I do n't know what to do . I 'm not a zelandoni . " Jondalarsat back on his heels , pulled his hand through his hair , and left bloodstains on his face . " Willowbark ! I 'd better make willowbark tea . " He went out to heat some water . He did n't have to be a zelandoni to know about the painkilling properties of willowbark ; everyone made willowbark if they had a headache , or some other minor pain . He did n't know if it was used for serious wounds , but he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire , looking inside the tent with each circuit , waiting for the cold water to boil . He piled more wood on the fire and singed an edge of the wooden frame that supported the cooking hide full of water . Why is it taking so long ! Wait , I do n't have the willowbark . I 'd better get it before the water boils . He put his head inside the tent and stared at his brother for a long moment , then ran to the edge of the river . After peeling bark from a bare-leafed tree whose long thin branches trailed the water , he raced back . He looked first to see if Thonolan had roused , and saw that his summer tunic was soaked with blood . Then he noticed the overfull cooking skin boiling over and putting out the fire . He did n't know what to do firs  --  end to the tea , or to his brothe  --  nd he looked back and forth from the fire to the tent to the fire . Finally he grabbed a drinking cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then dropped the willowbark in the hide pot . He put a few more sticks on the fire , hoping they would catch . He searched through Thonolan 's backframe , dumped it out in frustration , and picked up his brother 's summer tunic to replace his bloody one. 104As he started into the tent , Thonolan moaned . It was the first sound he had heard from his brother . He scrambled out to scoop up a bowl of the tea , noticed there was hardly any liquid left , and wondered if it was too strong . He ducked back into the tent with a cup of the hot liquid , looked frantically for a place to set it , and saw that more was soaked with blood than his summer tunic . It was pooling under Thonolan , discoloring the sleeping roll . He 's losing too much blood ! 0 Mother ! He needs a zelandoni . What am I going to do ? He was becoming more agitated and fearful for his brother . He felt so helpless . I need to go for help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't even get across the Sister , and I ca n't leave him . Some wolf or hyena will smell the blood and come after him . Great Mother ! Look at all the blood on that tunic ! Some animal will smell it . Jondalar snatched the blood-soaked shirt and threw it out of the tent . No , that 's not any better ! He dove out of the tent , picked it up again , and looked wildly for some place to put it , away from the camp , away from his brother . He was in shock , overcome with grief , and , in the depths of his heart , he knew there was no hope . His brother needed help that he could not give , and he could not go for help . Even if he knew where to go , he could n't leave . It was senseless to think any bloody tunic would draw carnivorous animals any more than Thonolan himself would , with his open wound . But he did n't want to face the truth in his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic . He spied the stand of alder and , in an irrational moment , raced up the hill and stuffed the leather shirt high up in a crook of one of the trees . Then he ran back . He went into the tent and stared at Thonolan , as if by sheer effort of will he could make his brother sound and whole again , and smiling . Almost as though Thonolan sensed the plea , he moaned , tossed his head , and opened his eyes . Jondalar kneeled closer and saw pain in his eyes , in spite of a weak smile . " You were right , Big Brother . You usually are . We did n't leave that rhino behind . " " I do n't want to be right , Thonolan . How do you feel ? " " Do you want an honest answer ? I hurt . How bad is it ? " he asked , trying to sit up . The halfhearted grin turned to a grimace of pain . " Do n't try to move . Here , I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the cup to his lips . Thonolan took a few sips , then lay back down with relief . A look of fear joined the pain in his eyes. 105 " Tell me straight , Jondalar . How bad is it ? " The tall man closed his eyes and drew a breath . " It 's not good . " " I did n't think so , but how bad ? " Thonolan 's eyes fell on his brother 's hands and opened wider with alarm . " There 's blood all over your hands ! Is it mine ? I think you 'd better tell me . " " I do n't really know . You 're gored in the groin , and you 've lost a lot of blood . The rhino must have tossed you , too , or trampled you . I think you have a couple of broken ribs . I do n't know what else . I 'm not a zelandoni ... " " But I need one , and the only chance of finding help is across that river we ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Help me up , Jondalar . I want to see how bad it is . " Jondalar started to object , then reluctantly gave in and was immediatelysorry . The moment Thonolan tried to sit , he cried out in pain and lost consciousness again . " Thonolan ! " Jondalar cried . The bleeding had slowed , but his effort caused it to flow again . Jondalar folded his brother 's summer tunic and put it over the wound , then left the tent . The fire was nearly out . Jondalar added fuel more carefully and built it up again , set more water to heat , and cut more wood . He went back to check on his brother again . Thonolan 's tunic was soaked with blood . He moved it aside to look at the wound , and he grimaced remembering how he had run up the hill to get rid of the other tunic . His initial panic was gone , and it seemed so foolish . The bleeding had stopped . He found another piece of clothing , a coldweatherundergarment , laid it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the second bloody tunic and walked to the river . He threw it in , then bent to wash the blood off his hands , still feeling ridiculous over his panic . He did n't know that panic was a survival trait , in extreme circumstances . When all else fails , and all rational means of finding a solution have been exhausted , panic takes over . And sometimes an irrational act becomes a solution the rational mind would never have thought of . He walked back , put a few more sticks of wood on the fire , then went to look for the alder staff , though it seemed pointless to be making a spear now . He just felt so useless , he needed to do something . He found it , then sat outside the tent , and with vicious strokes , began to shave one end . The next day was a nightmare for Jondalar . The left side of Thonolan 's body was tender to the lightest touch and deeply bruised . Jondalar had slept little . It had been a difficult night for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But all he could offer was willowbark tea , and that did n't help much . In the morning , he cooked some food and made broth , but neither man ate much . By evening , the wound was hot , and Thonolan was feverish . Thonolan woke from a restless sleep to his brother 's troubled blue eyes . The sun had just dipped below the rim of the earth , and though it was still light outside , in the tent it was harder to see . The dimness did n't keep Jondalar from noticing how glazed Thonolan 's eyes were , and he had been moaning and mumbling in his sleep . Jondalar tried to smile encouragingly . " How are you feeling ? " Thonolan hurt too much to smile , and Jondalar 's worried look was not reassuring . " I do n't feel much like hunting rhinos , " he replied . They were silent for a while , neither knowing what to say . Thonolan closed his eyes and sighed deeply . He was tired of fighting the pain . His chest hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left groin seemed to have spread to his whole body . If he had thought there was any hope , he would have endured it , but the longer they stayed , the less chance Jondalar would have of crossing the river before a storm . Just because he was going to die was no reason his brother had to die , too . He opened his eyes again . " Jondalar , we both know without help there 's no hope for me , but there 's no reason you ... " " What do you mean , no hope ? You 're young , you 're strong . You 'll be all right . " " There 's not enough time . We do n't have a chance out here in the open . Jondalar , keep moving , find a place to stay , you ... " " You 're delirious ! " " No , I ... " " You would n't be talking like that if you were n't . You worry about gaining your strengt  --  et me worry about taking care of us . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plan . " " What plan ? " " I 'll tell you about it when I get all the details worked out . Do you want something to eat ? You have n't eaten much . " Thonolan knew his brother would n't leave while he was alive . He was tired ; he wanted to give up , let it end , and give Jondalar a chance . " I 'm not hungry , " he said , then saw the hurt in his brother 's eyes . " I could use a drink of water , though . " Jondalar poured out the last of the water and held Thonolan 's head while he drank . He shook the bag . " This is empty . I 'll get some more . " He wanted an excuse to get out of the tent . Thonolan was giving106 107up . Jondalar had been bluffing when he said he had a plan . He had given up hop  --  o wonder his brother thought it was hopeless . I have to find some way to get us across that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise that gave him a view upriver , over the trees , and stood watching a broken branch snagged by a jutting rock . He felt as trapped and helpless as that bare limb and , on impulse , walked to the water 's edge and freed it from the restraining stone . He watched the current carry it downstream , wondering how far it would go before it was snared by something else . He noticed another willow , and he peeled more inner bark with his knife . Thonolan might have a bad night again , not that the tea did much good . Finally he turned away from the Sister and went back to the small creek that added its tiny fraction to the rampaging river . He filled the waterbag and started back . He was n't sure what made him look upstrea  --  ecould n't have heard anything above the sound of the rushingtorren  --  ut when he did , he stared in open-mouthed disbelief . Something was approaching from upriver , heading straight for the bank where he stood . A monstrous water bird , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and large unblinking eyes , was coming toward him . He saw movement on the creature 's back as it drew near , heads of other creatures . One of the smaller creatures waved . " Ho-la ! " a voice called out . Jondalar had never heard a more welcomesound. yla wiped the back of her hand across her sweaty forehead and smiled at the little yellow horse who had nudged her , trying to insinuate her muzzle under the woman 's hand . The filly did n't like to let Ayla out of her sight and followed her everywhere . Ayla did n't mind , she wanted the company . " Little horse , how much grain should I pick for you ? " Ayla motioned . The small , hay-colored foal watched her motions closely . It made Ayla think of herself when she was a young girl just learning the sign language of the Clan . " Are you trying to learn to talk ? Well , understand , anyway . You 'd have trouble talking without hands , but you seem to be trying to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; her clan 's ordinary language was n't entirely silent , only the ancient formal language was . The filly 's ears perked up when she spoke a word out loud . " You 're listening , are n't you , little filly ? " Ayla shook her head . " I keep calling you little filly , little horse . It does n't feel right . I think you need a name . Is that what you are listening for , the sound of your name ? I wonder what your dam called you ? I do n't think I could say it if I knew . " The young horse was watching her intently , knowing Ayla was paying attention to her when she moved her hands in that way . She nickered when Ayla stopped . " Are you answering me ? Whiiinneeey ! " Ayla tried to mimic her and made a fair approximation of a horse 's whinny . The young horse responded to the almost familiar sound with a toss of her head and an answering neigh . " Is that your name ? " Ayla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , bounded off a ways , then came back . The woman laughed . " All little horses must have the same name , then , or maybe I ca n't tell the difference . " Ayla whinnied again and the horse whinnied back , and they played the game for a while . It made her think of the game of sounds she used to play with her son , except Durc could make any sound she could . Creb had told her she made many sounds108 109when they first found her , and she knew she could make some no one else could . It had pleased her when she discovered her son could make them , too . Ayla turned back to picking grain from the tall einkorn wheat . Emmerwheat grew in the valley , too , and rye grass similar to the kind that grew near the clan 's cave . She was thinking about naming the horse . I 've never named anyone before . She smiled to herself . Would n't they think I was strange , naming a horse . Not any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal racing and friskingplayfully . I 'm so glad she lives with me , Ayla thought , feeling a lump in her throat . It 's not so lonely with her around . I do n't know what I 'd do if I lost her now . I am going to name her . The sun was on its way down when Ayla stopped and glanced at the sky . It was a big sky , vast , empty . Not a single cloud measured its depth nor arrested the eye from infinity . Only the distant incandescencein the west , whose wavering circumference was revealed in afterimage , marred the rich , uniformly blue expanse . Judging the amount of daylight left by the space between the radiance and the top of the cliff , she decided to stop . The horse , noticing her attention was no longer on her task , whinniedand came to her . " Should we go back to the cave ? Let 's get a drink of water first . " She put her arm around the neck of the young horse and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the base of the steep southern wall was a slow-motion kaleidoscope of color , reflecting the rhythm of the seasons ; now deep somber greens of pine and fir dabbed with vivid golds , paler yellows , dry browns , and fiery reds . The sheltered valley was a bright swatch amidst the muted beige of the steppes , and the sun was warmer within its wind-protected walls . For all the fall colors , it had felt like a warm summer day , a misleading illusion . " I think I should get more grass . You 're starting to eat your beddingwhen I put it down fresh . " Walking beside the horse , Ayla continuedher monologue , then unconsciously stopped the hand motions , her thoughts alone carrying on the thread . Iza always collected grass in fall for winter bedding . It smelled so good when she changed it , especially when the snow was deep and the wind blowing outside . I used to love falling asleep listening to the wind and smelling summerfreshhay . When she saw the direction they were going , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be as thirsty as I am , little whiiinneey , " she said , making the sound out loud in response to thefilly 's call . That does sound like a name for a horse , but naming should be done properly . " Whinney ! Whiiinneeey ! " she called . The animal perked up her head , looked toward the woman , then trotted to her . Ayla rubbed her head and scratched her . She was shedding her prickly baby coat and growing in longer winter hair , and she always loved a scratching . " I think you like that name , and it suits you , my little horse baby . I think we should have a naming ceremony . I ca n't pick you up in my arms , though , and Creb is n't here to mark you . I guess I 'll have to be the mog-ur and do it . " She smiled . Imagine , a woman mog-ur . Ayla started back toward the river again but veered upstream when she noticed she was near the open place where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hole , but the young horse spooked around it , sniffing and snorting and pawing the ground , bothered by some lingering odor or memory . The herd had not returned since the day they raced down the length of the valley , away from her fire and her noise . She led the filly to drink nearer the cave . The cloudy stream , engorgedwith fall runoff , had receded from its high point , leaving a slurry of rich brown mud at the water 's edge . It squished under Ayla 's feet and left a brownish red stain on her skin , and it reminded her of the red ochre paste Mog-ur used for ceremonial purposes , like namings . She swished her finger around in the mud and made a mark on her leg , then smiled and scooped up a handful . I was going to look for red ochre , she thought , but this might do as well . Closing her eyes , Ayla tried to remember what Creb had done when he named her son . She could see his ravaged old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where an eye should have been , his large nose , his overhanging brow ridges and low sloping forehead . His beard had gotten thin and scraggly , and his hairline had receded , but she remembered him the way he had looked that day . Not young , but at the peak of his power . She had loved that magnificent , craggy old face . Suddenly all her emotions came flooding back . Her fear that she would lose her son and her utter joy at the sight of a bowl of red ochre paste . She swallowed hard several times , but the lump in her throat would not go down , and she wiped a tear away , not knowing she left a smudge of brown in its place . The little horse leaned against her , nuzzling for affection , almost as though she sensed Ayla 's need . The110 111woman knelt down and hugged the animal , resting her forehead against the sturdy neck of the little filly . This is supposed to be your naming ceremony , she thought , gainingcontrol of herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scooped up another handful , then reached toward the sky with the other hand , as Creb had always done with his abbreviated onehandedgestures , calling for the spirits to attend . Then she hesitated , not sure if she should invoke the Clan spirits at the naming of a hors  --  hey might not approve . She dipped her fingers into the mud in her hand and made a streak down the foal 's face , from her forehead to the end of her nose , as Creb had drawn a line with the paste of red ochre from the place where Durc 's brow ridges met to the tip of his rather small nose . " Whinney , " she said aloud , and finished with the formal language . " This girl 's . . . this female horse 's name is Whinney . " The horse shook her head , trying to rid herself of the wet mud on her face , making Ayla laugh . " It will dry up and wear off soon , Whinney . " She washed her hands , adjusted the basketful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cave . The naming ceremony had reminded her too much of her solitary existence . Whinney was a warm living creature and eased her loneliness , but by the time Ayla reached the rocky beach , tears had come unbidden , unnoticed . She coaxed and guided the young horse up the steep path to her cave , which roused her out of her grief somewhat . " Come on , Whinney , you can do it . I know you 're not an ibex or a saiga antelope , but it only takes getting used to . " They reached the top of the wall that was the front extension of her cave and went in . Ayla rekindled the banked fire and started some grain cooking . The young filly was now eating grass and grain and did n't need specially prepared food , but Ayla made mashes for her because Whinney liked them . She took a brace of rabbits , caught earlier in the day , outside to skin them while it was still light , brought them in to cook , and rolled up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had accumulated a large supply of animal skins : rabbits , hares , hamsters , whatevershe caught . She was n't sure how she was going to use them , but she carefully cured and saved them all . During the winter she might think of a use for them . If it got cold enough , she 'd just pile them around her . Winter was on her mind as the days grew shorter and the temperaturefell . She did n't know how long or harsh it would be , which worriedher . A sudden attack of anxiety sent her checking her stores , though she knew exactly what she had . She looked through baskets and bark containers of dried meat , fruits and vegetables , seeds , nuts , and grains . In the dark corner farthest from the entrance , she examinedpiles of whole , sound roots and fruits to make sure no signs of rot had appeared . Along the rear wall were stacks of wood , dried horse dung from the field , and mounds of dry grass . More baskets of grain , for Whinney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the hearth to check the grain cooking in a tightly woven basket and turn the rabbits , then past her bed and personal belongings along the wall near it , to examine herbs , roots , and barks suspended from a rack . She had sunk the posts for it in the packed earth of the cave not too far from the fireplace , so the seasonings , teas , and medicines would benefit from the heat as they dried , but would not be too close to the fire . She had no clan to tend and did n't need all the medicines , but she had kept Iza 's pharmacopoeia well stocked after the old woman becametoo weak , and she was accustomed to gathering the medicines along with food . On the other side of the herb rack was an assortment of various materials : chunks of wood , sticks and branches , grasses and barks , hides , bones , several rocks and stones , even a basket of sand from the beach . She did n't like to dwell too much on the long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no ceremonies with feasting and storytelling , no new babies to anticipate , no gossiping , or conversations , or discussions of medical lore with Iza or Uba , no watchingthe men discuss hunting tactics . She planned instead to spend her time making thing  --  he more difficult and time-consuming , the bette  --  okeep herself as busy as possible . She looked over some of the solid chunks of wood . They ranged from small to large so she could make bowls of various sizes . Gouging out the inside and shaping it with a hand-axe used as an adze , and a knife , then rubbing it smooth with a round rock and sand could take days ; she planned to make several . Some of the small hides would be made into hand coverings , leggings , footwear linings , others would be dehaired and worked so well that they would be as soft and pliable as baby 's skin , but very absorbent . Her collection of beargrass , cattail leaves and stalks , reeds , willow switches , roots of trees , would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in intricate patterns , for cooking , eating , storage containers , winnowing trays , serving trays , mats for sitting upon , serving112 113or drying food . She would make cordage , in thicknesses from string to rope , from fibrous plants , barks and the sinew and long tail of the horse ; and lamps out of stone with shallow wells pecked out to be filled with fat and a dried moss wick which burned with no smoke . She had kept the fat of carnivorous animals separate for that use . Not that she would n't eat it if she had to , it was just a matter of taste preference . There were flat hipbones and shoulder bones to be shaped into plates and platters , others for ladles or stirrers ; fuzz from various plants to be used for tinder or stuffing , along with feathers and hair ; several nodules of flint and implements to shape it with . She had passed many a slow winter day making similar objects and implements , necessary for existence , but she also had a supply of materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had watched men make them often enough : hunting weapons . She wanted to make spears , clubs shaped to fit the hand , new slings . She thought she might even try a bola , although skill with that weapon took as much practice as the sling . Brun was the expert with the bola ; just making the weapon was a skill in itself . Three stones had to be pecked round , into balls , then attached to cords and fastenedtogether with the proper length and balance . Would he teach Durc ? Ayla wondered . Daylight was fading and her fire was nearly out . The grain had absorbed all the water and softened . She took a bowlful for herself , then added water and prepared the rest for Whinney . She poured it into a watertight basket and brought it to the animal 's sleeping place against the wall on the opposite side of the cave mouth . For the first few days down on the beach , Ayla had slept with the little horse , but she decided the foal should have her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried horse dung for fuel , she found little use for fresh droppings on her sleeping furs , and the foal seemed unhappyabout it as well . The time would come when the horse would be too big to sleep with , and her bed was n't big enough for both of them , though she often lay down and cuddled the baby animal in the place she had made for her . " It should be enough , " Ayla motioned to the horse . She was developing a habit of talking to her , and the young horse was beginning to respond to certain signals . " I hope I gathered enough for you . I wish I knew how long the winters are here . " She was feeling rather edgy and a little depressed . If it had n't been dark , she would have gone for a brisk walk . Or better , a long run . When the horse started chewing on her basket , Ayla brought her anarmload of fresh hay . " Here , Whinney , chew on this . You 're not supposedto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special attention to her young companion with petting and scratching . When she stopped , the foal nuzzled her hand and presented a flank that was in need of more attention . " You must be very itchy . " Ayla smiled and began scratching again . " Wait , I have an idea . " She went back to the place where her miscellaneousmaterials were assembled and found a bundle of dried teasel . When the flower of the plant dried , it left an enlongated eggshapedspiny brush . She snapped one from its stem , and with it gently scratched the spot on Whinney 's flank . One spot led to another and before she stopped , she had brushed and curried Whinney 's entireshaggy coat , much to the young animal 's evident delight . Then she wrapped her arms around Whinney 's neck and lay down on the fresh hay beside the warm young animal . Ayla woke up with a start . She stayed very still with her eyes open wide , filled with forboding . Something was wrong . She felt a cold draft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She was n't sure if she had heard it , over the sound of the horse 's breath and heartbeat . Did it come from the back of the cave ? It was so dark , she could n't see . It was so dark . . . . That was it ! There was no warm red glow from the banked fire in the hearth . And her orientation to the cave was n't right . The wall was on the wrong side , and the draft . . . There it was again ! The snuffling and coughing ! What am I doing in Whinney'splace ? I must have fallen asleep and forgotten to bank the fire . Now it 's out . I have n't lost my fire since I found this valley . Ayla shuddered and suddenly felt the hairs on the back of her neck rise . She had no word , no gesture , no concept for the presentiment that washed over her , but she felt it . The muscles of her back tightened . Something was going to happen . Something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she knew she breathed . She 'd had these feelings occasionally , ever since the night she had followed Creb and the mog-urs into the small room deep in the cave of the clan that hosted the Gathering . Creb had discovered her , not because he saw her , but because he felt her . And she had felt him , inside her brain in some strange way . Then she had seen things she could n't explain . Afterward , sometimes , she knew things . She knew when Broud was staring at her , though her back was turned . She knew the malignant hatred he felt for her in his heart . And she knew , 114 115before the earthquake , that there would be death and destruction in the clan 's cave . But she had not felt anything so strongly before . A deep sense of anxiety , fea  --  ot about the fire , she realized , and not for herself . For someone she loved . She got up , silently , and felt her way to the hearth , hoping there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was cold . Suddenlyshe had an urgent need to relieve herself , found the wall and followed it toward the entrance . A cold gust whipped her hair back from her face and rattled the dead coals in the fireplace , blowing up a cloud of ashes . She shivered . As she stepped out , a strong wind buffeted her . She leaned into it and hugged the wall as she walked to the end of the stone ledge oppositethe path , where she dumped her refuse . No stars graced the sky , but the overcast cloud layer diffused the moonlight to a uniform glow , making the black outside less complete than the black within the cave . But it was her ears , not her eyes , that warned her . She heard snuffling and breathing before she saw the slinking movement . She reached for her sling , but it was n't at her waist . She had n't brought it . She had grown careless around her cave , depending on the fire to keep unwanted intruders away . But her fire was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predators . Suddenly , from the mouth of the cave , she heard a loud whooping cackle . Whinney neighed , and it had a note of fear . The little horse was inside the stone chamber , and its only access was blocked by hyenas . Hyenas ! Ayla thought . There was something about the mad cacklingsound of their laughter , their scruffy spotted fur , the way their backs sloped down from well-developed forelegs and shoulders to smaller hind legs giving them a cowering look , that irritated her . And she could never forget Oga 's scream as she watched , helpless , while her son was dragged away . This time they were after Whinney . She did n't have her sling , but that did n't stop her . It was n't the first time she had acted without thinking of her own safety when someone else was threatened . She ran toward the cave , waving her fist and shouting . " Get out of here ! Get away ! " They were verbal sounds , even in Clan language . The animals scuttled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back down , and , though the fire had gone out , its smell still lingered . But there was another element . Her scent was not com-116monly known to the beasts , but it was becoming familiar , and the last time it had been accompanied by hard-flung stones . Ayla felt around inside the dark cave for her sling , angry with herselfbecause she could n't remember where she had put it . That wo n't happen again , she decided . I 'm going to make a place for it and keep it there . Instead , she gathered up her cooking stone  --  he knew where they were . When one bold hyena ventured close enough for his outline to be silhouetted in the cave opening , he discovered that , even without the sling , her aim was true , and the stones smarted . After a few more attempts , the hyenas decided the young horse was n't such easy game after all . Ayla groped in the dark for more stones and found one of the sticks she had been notching to mark the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night beside Whinney , prepared to defend the foal with only a stick , if necessary . Fighting off sleep proved to be more difficult . She dozed for a while just before dawn , but the first streak of morning light found her out on the ledge with sling in hand . No hyenas were in sight . She went back in for her fur wrap and foot coverings . The temperature had taken a decided drop . The wind had shifted during the night . Blowingfrom the northeast , it was funneled by the long valley until , baffled by the jutting wall and the bend in the river , it blasted into her cave in erratic bursts . She ran down the steep path with her waterbag and shattered a thin transparent film which had formed at the edge of the stream . The air had that enigmatic smell of snow . As she broke through the clear crust and dipped out icy water , she wondered how it could be so cold when it had been so warm the day before . It had changed fast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took only a change in the weather to remind her that she could n't afford to become complacent . Iza would have been upset with me for going to sleep without bankingthe fire . Now I 'll have to make a new one . I did n't think the wind would be able to blow into my cave either ; it always comes from the north . That might have helped the fire go out . I should have banked it , but driftwood burns so hot when it 's dry . It does n't hold a fire well . Maybe I should chop down some green trees . They 're harder to get started , but they burn slower . I should cut posts for a windscreen , too , and bring up more wood . Once it snows , it will be harder to get . I 'll get my hand-axe and chop the trees before I make a fire . I do n't want the wind to blow it out before I make a windscreen . She picked up a few pieces of driftwood on her way back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greeting , and butted her gently , looking for affection . Ayla smiled , but hurried into the cave , followed closely by Whinney , trying to get her nose under the woman 's hand . All right , Whinney , Ayla thought after she put the wood and water down . She patted and scratched the foal for a moment , then put some grain into her basket . She ate some cold leftover rabbit and wished she had some hot tea , but she drank cold water instead . It was cold in the cave . She blew on her hands and put them under her arms to warm them , then got out a basket of tools which she kept near her bed . She had made a few new ones shortly after she arrived and had been meaning to make more , but something else always seemed more important . She picked out her hand-axe , the one she had carried with her , and took it outside to examine in better light . If handled properly , a hand-axe could be self-sharpening . Tiny spalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sharp edge behind . But mishandlingcould cause a large flake to break off , or even break the brittlestone into fragments . Ayla did n't notice the clop of Whinney 's hooves coming up behind her ; she was too accustomed to the sound . The young animal tried to put her nose in Ayla 's hand . " Oh , Whinney ! " she cried , as the brittle flint hand-axe fell on the hard stone ledge and broke in several pieces . " That was my only hand-axe . I need it to chop wood . " I do n't know what is wrong , she thought . My fire goes out just when it turns cold . Hyenas come , as though they did n't expect to find a fire , all ready to attack you . And now , my only hand-axe breaks . She was getting worried , a streak of bad luck was not a good omen . I 'll have to make a new hand-axe now , before I do anything else . She picked up the pieces of the hand-ax  --  t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  nd put them near the cold fireplace . From a niche behind her sleeping place , she took out a bundle wrapped in the hide of a giant hamster and tied with a cord , and brought it down to the rocky beach . Whinney followed , but when her nudging and butting caused the woman to push her away rather than pet her , she left Ayla to her stones and wandered around the wall into the valley . Ayla unwrapped the bundle carefully , reverently ; an attitude assimilatedearly from Droog , the clan 's master toolmaker . It held an assortment of objects . The first she picked up was an oval stone . The first time she worked the flint , she had searched for a hammerstone thatfelt good in her hand and had the right resilience when struck against flint . All stone working tools were important , but none had the significance of the hammerstone . It was the first implement to touch the flint . Hers had only a few nicks , unlike Droog 's hammerstone , battered from repeated use . But nothing could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough out a flint tool , but the truly fine ones were made by expert toolmakers who cared for their implements and knew how to keep a hammerstone spirit happy . Ayla worried about the spirit of her hammerstone , though she never had before . It was so much more important now that she had to be her own master toolmaker . She knew rituals were required to avert bad luck if a hammerstonebroke , to placate the stone 's spirit and coax it into lodging in a new stone , and she did n't know them . She put the hammerstone aside and examined a sturdy piece of legbone from a grazing animal for signs of splintering from the last time she used it . After the bone hammer , she looked over a retoucher , the canine tooth of a large cat dislodged from a jawbone she had found in the pile at the bottom of the wall , and then she checked the other pieces of bone and stone . She had learned to knap flint by watching Droog and then practicing . He did n't mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention and she knew he approved of her efforts , but she was not his apprentice . It was n't worthwhile to consider a female ; the range of tools they were allowed to make was limited . They could not make tools that were used to hunt or those used to make weapons . She had found out that the tools women used were not so different . A knife was a knife after all , and a notched flake could be used to sharpen a point on a digging stick or a spear . She looked over her implements and picked up a nodule of flint , then put it down . If she was going to do some serious flint knapping , she needed an anvil , something to support the stone while she worked it . Droog did n't need an anvil to make a hand-axe , he only used it for more advanced tools , but Ayla found she had more control if she had support for the heavy flint , though she could rough out tools without one . She wanted a firm flat surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard blows . The foot bone of a mammoth was what Droog used , and she decided to see if she could find one in the bone pile . She climbed around the jumbled mound of bones , wood , and stone . There were tusks ; there had to be foot bones . She found a long branch and used it as a lever to move heavy pieces . It snapped when118 119she tried to pry up a boulder . Then she found a small ivory tusk of a young mammoth which proved to be much stronger . Finally , near the edge of the pile closest to the inside wall , she saw what she was looking for and managed to extricate it from the mass of rubble . As she dragged the foot bone back to her work area , her eye was caught by a gray-yellow stone that gleamed in the sunlight and flashed from facets . It looked familiar , but it was n't until she stopped and picked up a piece of the iron pyrite that she remembered why . My amulet , she thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My Cave Lion gave me a stone like this to tell me my son would live . Suddenly she noticed the beach was strewn with the brassy gray stones glittering in the sun ; recognition had made her conscious of them , though she had overlooked them before . It made her aware , too , that the clouds were breaking up . It was the only one when I found mine . Here there 's nothing special about them , they 're all over . She dropped the stone and dragged the mammoth foot bone down the beach , then sat down and pulled it between her legs . She covered her lap with the hamster hide and picked up the flint again . She turned it over and over , trying to decide where to make the first strike , but she could n't settle down and concentrate . Something was bothering her . She thought it must be the hard , lumpy , cold stones she was sitting on . She ran up to the cave for a mat , and she brought down her fire drill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I get a fire going . The morning is half gone and it 's still cold . She settled herself on the mat , put the toolmaking implements within reach , pulled the foot bone between her legs , and laid the hide across her lap . Then she reached for the chalky gray stone and positionedit on the anvil . She picked up the hammerstone , hefted it a few times to get the right grip , then put it down . What 's wrong with me ? Why am I so restless ? Droog always asked his totem for help before he started ; maybe that 's what I need to do . She clasped her hand around her amulet , closed her eyes and took several slow deep breaths to calm herself . She did n't make a specific reques  --  he just tried to reach the spirit of the Cave Lion with her mind and with her heart . The spirit that protected her was part of her , inside her , the old magician had explained , and she believed him . Trying to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did have a soothing effect . She felt herself relax , and , when she opened her eyes , she flexed her fingers and reached again for the hammerstone . After the first blows broke away the chalky cortex , she stopped toexamine the flint critically . It had good color , a dark gray sheen , but the grain was not the finest . Still , there were no inclusions ; about right for a hand-axe . Many of the thick flakes that fell away as she began to shape the flint into a hand-axe could be used . They had a bulge , a bulb of percussion , on the end of the flake where the hammerstonestruck , but they tapered to a sharp edge . Many had semicircularripples that left a deep rippled scar on the core , but such flakes could be used for heavy-duty cutting implements , like cleavers to cut through tough hide and meat , or sickles to cut grass . When Ayla had the general shape she wanted , she transferred to the bone hammer . Bone was softer , more elastic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat wavy edge , as the stone striker would have . Taking careful aim , she struck very close to the rippled edge . Longer , thinner flakes , with a flatter percussion bulge and less rippled edges were detached with each blow . In much less time than it took her to get prepared , the tool was finished . It was about five inches long , in outline shaped like a pear with a pointed end , but flat . It had a strong , rather thin cross section , and straight cutting edges from the point down the sloping sides . Its rounded base was made to hold in the hand . It could be used as an axe to chop wood , as an adz  --  erhaps to make a bowl . With it a piece of mammoth ivory could be broken to a smaller size , as could animal bones when butchering . It was a strong , sharp hitting tool with many uses . Ayla was feeling better , looser , ready to try the more advanced and difficult technique . She reached for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outer covering . The stone was flawed . The chalky surface extended into the dark gray interior , all the way through the core . The inclusion made it unusable and interruptedthe flow of her work and concentration . It put her on edge again . She put her hammerstone down on the rocky beach . Another piece of bad luck , another bad omen . She did n't want to believe that , did n't want to give in . She looked at the flint again , wondered if she could make some usable flakes from it , and picked up her hammerstone again . She broke off one flake , but it needed retouching , so she put her hammerstone down and reached for a stone retoucher . But she only glanced in the direction of her other implements . Her eye was on the flint when she picked up a stone from the beac  --  nd caused an event that would change her life . Not all inventions are wrought by necessity . Sometimes serendipity plays a part . The trick is recognition . All the elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in just the right way . And chance120 121was the essential ingredient . No one , least of all the young woman sitting on a rocky beach in a lonely valley , would have dreamed of making such an experiment on purpose . When Ayla 's hand reached for the stone retoucher , it found instead a piece of iron pyrite of close to the same size . When she struck the exposed fresh flint from the flawed stone , the dry tinder from her cave happened to be nearby , and the spark produced when the two stones hit happened to fly into the ball of shaggy fiber . Most important , Ayla just happened to be looking in that direction when the spark flew , landed on the tinder , smoldered for a moment , and sent up a wisp of smoke before it died . That was the serendipity . Ayla supplied the recognition and the other necessary elements : she understood the process of making fire , she needed fire , and she was n't afraid to try something new . Even then , it took her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had observed . First the smoke puzzled her . She had to think about it beforeshe made the connection between the wisp of smoke and the spark , but then the spark puzzled her more . Where had it come from ? That was when she looked at the stone in her hand . It was the wrong stone ! It was n't her retoucher , it was one of those shiny stones that were scattered all over the beach . But it was still a stone , and stone did n't burn . Yet something had made a spark that had made the tinder smoke . The tinder had smoked , had n't it ? She picked up the ball of shaggy bark fiber , ready to believe she had imagined the smoke , but the small black hole left soot on her fingers . She picked up the iron pyrite again , and looked at it closely . How had the spark been drawn from the stone ? What had she done ? The flint flake , she had struck the flint . Feeling a little silly , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did I expect ? she thought . Then she banged them together again , with more force , striking sharply , and watched a spark fly . Suddenly , an idea that had been tenuously forming sprang into her mind full blown . A strange , exciting idea , and a little frightening , too . She put the two stones down carefully on the leather lap cover , on top of the mammoth foot bone , then gathered together the materials to build a fire . When she was ready , she picked up the stones , held them close to the tinder , and struck them together . A spark flew and then died on the cold stones . She changed the angle , tried again , but the force was less . She struck harder and watched a spark land squarely in the middle of the tinder . It singed a few strands and died , but the wisp of smoke was encouraging . The next time she struck thestones , the wind gusted , and the smoldering tinder flared before it went out . Of course ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position so she could blow on the incipient flame , and made another spark with the stones . It was a strong , bright , long-burning spark , and it landed right . She was close enough to feel the heat as she blew the smolderingtinder into flame . She fed it shavings , and slivers , and , almost before she knew it , she had a fire . It was ridiculously easy . She could n't believe how easy . She had to prove it to herself again . She gathered together more tinder , more shavings , more kindling , and then she had a second fire , and then a third , and a fourth . She felt an excitement that was part fear , part awe , part joy of discovery , and a large dose of sheer wonder , as she stood back and gazed at four ' separate fires , each made from the firestone . Whinney trotted back around the wall , drawn by the smell of smoke . Fire , once so fearful , smelled of safety now . " Whinney ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had to tell someone , to share her discovery , even if just with a horse . " Look ! " she motioned . " Look at those fires ! They were made with stones , Whinney . Stones ! " The sun broke through the clouds , and suddenly the whole beach seemed to glitter . I was wrong when I thought there was nothing special about those stones . I should have known ; my totem gave one to me . Look at them . Now that I know , I can see the fire that lives inside . She grew thoughtful then . But why me ? Why was I shown ? My Cave Lion gave one to me once to tell me Durc would live . What is he telling me now ? She remembered the strange premonition she 'd had after her fire died and , standing in the midst of four fires , she shivered , feeling it again . Then , suddenly , she felt an overwhelming sense of relief , though she did n't even know she had been worried. 122 123H @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , running to the river 's edge . He felt an overwhelming sense of relief . He had all but given up , but the sound of another human voice filled him with a fresh surge of hope . It did n't occur to him that they might be unfriendly ; nothing could be worse than the utter helplessness he had felt . And they did n't seem unfriendly . The man who had called to him held up a coil of rope , attached at one end to the strange enormous water bird . Jondalar could see that it was not a living creature , but some kind of craft . The man threw the rope at him . Jondalar dropped it and splashed in after it . A couple of other people , hauling on another rope , scrambled out and waded through water swirling up to their thighs . One of them , smiling when he saw Jondalar 's expressio  --  hich managed to combine hope , relief , and perplexity over what to do with the wet rope in his hands ? took the hawser from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied the rope to a tree and went to check on the other line snubbed to a jutting end of a broken branch of a large tree that lay half submerged in the river . Another occupant of the watercraft hoisted himself over the side and jumped on the log to test its stability . He said a few words in an unfamiliar language , and a ladderlike gangplank was lifted up and stretched across to the log . He climbed back to help a woman assist a third person down the gangplank and along the log to the shore , though it seemed the assistance was allowed rather than needed . The person , obviously greatly respected , had a composed , almost regal bearing , but there was an ellusive quality Jondalar could n't define , an ambiguity , and he found himself staring . Wind caught at wisps of long white hair tied at the nape of the neck , pulled back from a clean-shave  --  r beardles  --  ace lined with years , yet glowing with a soft luminous complexion . There was strength in the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it character ? Jondalar realized he was standing in cold water when he was beckonedout , but the enigma did not resolve itself on closer inspection , and he felt he was missing something important . Then he stopped and looked into a face with a compassionate , questioning smile and piercingeyes of some indeterminate shade of gray or hazel . With a flush of wonder , Jondalar suddenly realized the implications of the mysterious person waiting patiently in front of him , and looked for some hint of gender . Height was no help ; a little tall for a woman , a little short for a man . Bulky shapeless clothing hid physical details ; even the walk left Jondalar wondering . The more he looked and found no answer , the more relieved he felt . He knew of people like that ; born into the body of one sex but with the inclinations of the other . They were neither , or both , and usually joined the ranks of Those Who Served the Mother . With powers derived from both female and male elements centered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as healers . Jondalar was far from home and did not know the customs of these people , yet he had no doubt that the person standing in front of him was a healer . Maybe One Who Served the Mother , maybe not ; it did n't matter . Thonolan needed a healer , and a healer had come . But how had they known a healer was needed ? How had they known to come at all ? Jondalar threw another log on the fire and watched a burst of sparks chase smoke into the night sky . He slid his bare backside farther down into his sleeping roll and leaned back on a boulder to stare at the undying sparks flung across the heavens . A shape floated into his field of vision , blocking out a portion of the star-splashed sky . It took a moment for his unfocused eyes to shift from the endless depths to the head of the young woman holding a cup of steaming tea out to him . He sat up quickly and exposed a length of bare thigh and grabbed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his trousers and boots hanging near the fire to dry . She grinned , and her radiant smile changed the rather solemn , shy , softly pretty young woman into a flashing-eyed beauty . He had never seen such an amazing transformation , and his smile in response reflected his attraction . But she had ducked her head to suppress a laugh of mischievous humor , not wanting to embarrass the stranger . When she looked back , only a twinkle remained in her eyes . " You have a beautiful smile , " he said when she gave him the cup of tea . She shook her head and answered with words that he thought meant she did n't understand him. 125124 " I know you ca n't understand me , but I still want to tell you how grateful I am you are here . " She watched him closely , and he had the feeling she wanted to communicate as much as he . He kept talking , afraid she would leave if he stopped . " It 's wonderful just to talk to you , just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This is good . What kind is it ? " he asked , holding up the cup and nodding appreciatively . " I think I can taste chamomile . " She nodded back , acknowledging , then sat near the fire , answering his words with others he understood as little as she understood his . But her voice was pleasant and she seemed to know he wanted her company . " I wish I could thank you . I do n't know what I would have done if you had n't come . " He frowned with worry and tension , and she smiled understandingly . " I wish I could ask how you knew we were here , and how your zelandoni , or whatever you call your healer , knew to come . " She answered him , gesturing toward the tent that had been set up nearby , glowing from the firelight within . He shook his head with frustration . It seemed that she almost understood him ; he just could n't understand her . " I do n't suppose it matters , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me stay with Thonolan . Even without words , it was clear my brother would get no help until I left . I do n't doubt the healer 's ability . I want to stay with him , that 's all . " He was looking at her so earnestly that she laid a hand on his arm to reassure him . He tried to smile , but it was pained . The flap of the tent caught his attention as an older woman came out . " Jetamio ! " she called , adding other words . The young woman got up quickly , but Jondalar held her hand to detain her . " Jetamio ? " he asked , pointing to her . She nodded . " Jondalar , " he said , tapping his own chest . " Jondalar , " she repeated slowly . Then she looked toward the tent , tapped herself , then him , and pointed to it . " Thonolan , " he said . " My brother 's name is Thonolan . " " Thonolan , " she said , repeating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slight limp , Jondalar noticed , though it did n't seem to hinder her . His trousers were still damp , but he pulled them on anyway and made a dash for a wooded copse , not bothering to fasten them or put his boots on . He had been restraining his urge ever since he woke up , but his extra clothing was in his backframe , which had been left behindin the large tent where the healer was treating Thonolan . Jetamio 's grin of the evening before made him think twice about casuallysauntering over to the secluded patch of brush wearing nothing but his short inner shirt . Nor did he want to chance breaching some custom or taboo of these people who were helping hi  --  ot with two women in the camp . He had first tried to get up and walk in his sleeping roll , and he had waited so long before it occurred to him to put on his trousers , wet or not , that he was close to forgetting his embarrassment and ready to make a run for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tamio , do n't laugh at him . It 's not nice , " the older woman said , but the force of her admonition was lost as she tried to suppress her own laughter . " Oh , Rosh , I do n't mean to make fun of him , I just ca n't help it . Did you see him try to walk in his sleeping bag ? " She started giggling again , though she struggled to contain it . " Why did n't he just get up and go ? " " Maybe the customs of his people are different , Jetamio . They must have traveled a long way . I 've never seen clothes like theirs before , and his language is n't even close . Most travelers have a few words that are similar . I do n't think I could pronounce some of his words . " " You must be right . He must have some objection to showing his skin . You should have seen him blush last night just because I saw a little of his thigh . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Can you blame him ? " " How is the other one ? " the young woman said , serious again . " Has the Shamud said anything , Roshario ? " " I think the swelling is down , and the fever , too . At least he 's sleepingquieter . The Shamud thinks he was gored by a rhino . I do n't know how he lived through it . He would n't have much longer if that tall one had n't thought of that way to signal for help . Even so , it was luck we found them . Mudo must have smiled on them . The Mother always has favored handsome young men . " " Not enough to keep . . . Thonolan from getting hurt . The way he was gored . . . Do you think he 'll walk again ? " Roshario smiled tenderly at the young woman . " If he has half the determination you did , he 'll walk , Tamio . " Jetamio 's cheeks reddened . " I think I 'll go and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ducking toward the tent , and trying very hard not to limp at all. 126 127 " Why do n't you bring the tall one his pack , " Roshario called after her , " so he wo n't have to wear wet britches . " " I do n't know which one is his . " " Bring them both , it 'll make more room in there . And ask the Shamud how soon we can move ... what 's his name ? Thonolan ? " Jetamio nodded . " If we 're going to be here a while , Dolando will have to plan a hunt . We did n't bring much food . I do n't think the Ramudoi can fish with the river like that , though I think they 'd be just as happy if they never had to come to shore . I like solid ground under me . " " Oh , Rosh , you 'd be saying just the opposite if you had mated a Ramudoi man instead of Dolando . " The older woman eyed her sharply . " Have one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be your real mother , Jetamio , but everyone knows you are just like a daughter . If a man does n't even have the courtesy to ask , he 's not the kind of man you want . You ca n't trust those river men ... " " Do n't worry , Rosh . I have n't decided to run off with a river man ... yet , " Jetamio said with a mischievous smile . " Tamio , there are plenty of good Shamudoi men who will move into our lodging .... What are you laughing at ? " Jetamio had both her hands at her mouth , trying to swallow the laughter that kept bubbling forth in snorts and giggles . Roshario turned in the direction the younger woman was looking , and slapped a hand over her mouth to keep from bursting out with laughter herself . " I 'd better get those packs , " Jetamio finally managed to say . " Our tall friend needs some dry clothes . " She started sputtering again . " He looks like a baby with full pants ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jondalar heard her laughter peal forth as she entered . " Hilarity , my dear ? " the healer said , cocking an eyebrow with a quizzical look . " I 'm sorry , I did n't mean to come in here laughing like that . It 's just ... " " Either I 'm in the next world , or you 're a donii who 's come to take me there . No earthly woman could be so beautiful . But I ca n't understand a word you 're saying . " Jetamio and the Shamud both turned toward the wounded man . He was looking at Jetamio with a weak smile . Her smile left her face as she kneeled beside him . " I 've disturbed him ! How could I be so thoughtless ? " " Do n't stop smiling , my beautiful donii , " Thonolan said , taking her hand . " Yes , my dear , you have disturbed him . But do n't let it disturb you . I suspect he will be much more disturbed ' before you are through with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzled look . " I came to ask if there was anything you needed , or if I could help in any way . " " You just did . " She looked more perplexed . Sometimes she wondered if she ever understood anything the healer said . The piercing eyes took on a gentler look , with a touch of irony . " I 've done all I can . He must do the rest . But anything that gives him more will to live can only help at this stage . You just did that with your lovely smile ... my dear . " Jetamio blushed and bowed her head , then realized Thonolan was still holding her hand . She looked up and saw his laughing gray eyes . Her smile in response was radiant . The healer made a throat-clearing sound , and Jetamio broke contact , a little flustered to realize she had been staring at the stranger so long . " There is something you can do . Since he 's awake , and lucid , we might try giving him some nourishment . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , if it came from you . " " Oh . Of course . I 'll get some , " she said , hurrying out to cover her embarrassment . She saw Roshario attempting to talk to Jondalar , who was standing awkwardly and trying to look pleasant . She ducked back in to complete the rest of her errands . " I need to get their packs , and Roshario wants to know how soon Thonolan can be moved . " " What did you say his name was ? " " Thonolan . That 's what the other one told me . " " Tell Roshario a day or two yet . He 's not up to a ride over rough water . " " How do you know my name , beautiful donii , and how do I ask yours ? " She turned to smile at Thonolan before she hurried out with both packs . He settled back down with a self-satisfied grin , but gave a start when he noticed , for the first time , the white-haired healer . The enigmatic face held a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predatory . " Is n't young love splendid , " the Shamud commented . The meaning of the words was lost on Thonolan , but not the wry sarcasm . It made him look closer . The voice of the healer was pitched neither deep nor high , and Thonolan looked for some clue of dress or behavior that would tell him if it was a woman 's low alto or a man 's high tenor . He couldn't128 129decide , and though he was n't exactly sure why , he relaxed a bit , feelingconfident he was in the best of hands . Jondalar 's relief was so evident when he saw Jetamio come out of the tent with the backframes that she was a little ashamed she had n't gotten them sooner . She knew his problem , but he was so funny . He thanked her profusely with unfamiliar words that nonetheless communicatedhis gratitude , and then he headed for the patch of high brush . He felt so much better with dry clothes on , he even forgave Jetamio for laughing . I suppose I did look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cold . Well , a little laughter is a small price to pay for their help . I do n't know what I would have done ... I wonder how they knew ? Perhaps the healer has other power  --  hat could explain it . Right now , I 'm just glad for the healing powers . He stopped . At least I think that zelandoni has healing powers . I have n't seen Thonolan . I do n't know if he 's better or not . I think it 's time I found out . After all , he is my brother . They ca n't keep me away if I want to see him . Jondalar strode back to the camp , put his pack down beside the fire , deliberately took the time to stretch out his damp clothes to dry again , and then headed for the tent . He nearly bumped into the healer , who was leaving just as he ducked to enter . The Shamud sized him up quickly , and before Jondalarcould attempt to say anything , smiled ingratiatingly , stepped aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , acquiescingto the tall , powerful man . Jondalar gave the healer an appraising look . No hint of relinquished authority showed in the piercing eyes evaluating him in return , though any further disclosure of intent was as obscure as the ambiguouscolor . The smile , which had seemed ingratiating at first glance , was more ironic on second look . Jondalar sensed that this healer , like many of that calling , could be a powerful friend or a formidable enemy . He nodded , as though reserving judgment , briefly smiled his thanks , and went in . He was surprised to see that Jetamio had arrived before he did . She was supporting Thonolan 's head , holding a bone cup to his lips . " I might have known , " he said , and his smile was pure joy at seeing his brother awake , and apparently much improved . " You did it again . " Both of them looked up at Jondalar . " What did I do , Big Brother ? " . " Within three heartbeats of opening your eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " 130Thonolan 's grin was the most welcome sight his brother could imagine . " You are right about the prettiest woman around . " Thonolan looked fondly at Jetamio . " But what are you doing in the spirit world ? And while I 'm thinking of it , just remember , she 's my own personal donii . You can keep your big blue eyes to yourself . " " Do n't worry about me , Little Brother . Every time she looks at me , all she can do is laugh . " " She can laugh at me anytime she wants , " Thonolan said , smiling at the woman . She smiled in return . " Can you imagine waking up from the dead to that smile ? " His fondness was beginning to look adoring as he stared into her eyes . Jondalar looked from his brother to Jetamio and back again . What is going on here ? Thonolan just woke up , they ca n't have said one word to each other , but I 'd swear he was in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her hair was a rather nondescript shade of light brown , and she was smaller and thinner than the women Thonolan was usually attracted to . She could almost be mistaken for a girl . She had a heartshapedface with regular features and was really a rather ordinarylookingyoung woman ; pretty enough , but certainly not exceptional ? until she smiled . Then , by some unexpected alchemy , some mysterious redistributionof light and shadows , some subtle shift in arrangement , she becamebeautiful , completely beautiful . So complete was the transformation that Jondalar had thought of her as beautiful himself . She had only to smile once to create that impression , yet he had the feeling she did n't usually smile often . He remembered she had seemed solemn and shy at first , though it was hard to believe now . She was radiant , vibrantly alive , and Thonolan was looking at her with an idiotic , lovesick grin . Well , Thonolan has been in love before , Jondalar thought . I just hope she wo n't take it too hard when we leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flap in the roof of his tent was frayed . Jondalar was staring at it , but not seeing it . He was wide awake , lying in his sleeping roll wondering what had brought him out of the depths of sleep so quickly . He did n't move , but he was listening , smelling , trying to detect anything unusual that might have alerted him to some impending danger . After a few moments , he slipped out of his bedroll and looked carefully out of the opening of his tent but could find nothing wrong . A few people were gathered around the campfire . He wandered over , still feeling restless and edgy . Something bothered him , but he131did n't know what . Thonolan ? No , between the skill of the Shamud and Jetamio 's attentive care , his brother was doing well . No , it was n't Thonolan that was troubling hi  --  xactly . " Hola , " he said to Jetamio as she looked up and smiled . She did n't find him so laughable any more . Their mutual concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicationwas limited to basic gestures and the few words he had learned . She gave him a cup of hot liquid . He thanked her with the words he had learned that expressed the concept of thanks for them , wishing he could find a way to repay them for their help . He took a sip , frowned , and took another . It was an herb tea , not unpleasant , but surprising . They customarily drank a meat-flavored broth in the morning . His nose told him the kerfed wooden cooking box near the fire had roots and grain simmering in it , but no meat . It took only a quick glance to explain the change in the morning menu . There was no meat ; no one had gone hunting . He quaffed his drink , put down the bone cup , and hurried back to his tent . While waiting , he had finished making the sturdy spears out of the alder saplings and even tipped them with flint points . He picked up the two heavy shafts that were leaning against the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took several of the lighter throwing spears , and walked back to the fire . He did n't know many words , but it did n't take many to communicate a desire to go hunting , and before the sun was much higher , an excited group was gathering . Jetamio was torn . She wanted to stay with the wounded stranger whose laughing eyes made her feel like smiling every time he looked at her , but she wanted to go hunting , too . She never missed a hunt if she could help it , not since she had been able to hunt . Roshario urged her to go . " He 'll be fine . The Shamud can take care of him without you for a little while , and I 'll be here . " The hunting party had already started out when Jetamio called after them and ran up out of breath , still tying on her hood . Jondalar had wondered if she hunted . Young Zelandonii women often did . For women , it was a matter of choice , and the custom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually stayed closer to home , except during a drive . When they went on battue , every able-bodied person was necessary to drive a herd into traps or over cliffs . Jondalar liked women who hunte  --  ost men of his Cave did , though he 'd learned the feeling was by no means universal . It was said that women who had hunted themselves appreciated the difficulties and made more understanding mates . His mother had been noted , 132especially , for her tracking prowess , and she had often joined a hunt even after she had children . They waited for Jetamio to catch up , then set off at a good pace . Jondalar thought the temperature was dropping , but they were movingso fast that he was n't sure until they stopped beside a meandering streamlet winding its way across the flat grassland searching for a way to reach the Mother . He noticed the ice thickening along the edges when he filled up his waterbag . He pushed back his hood , the furaround his face limiting peripheral visio  --  ut before long he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air was decidedly nippy . Someone noticed tracks upstream , and they all gathered around while Jondalar examined them . A family of rhinoceroses had stopped for a drink , too , and not long before . Jondalar drew a plan of attack in the wet sand of the bank with a stick , noticing that ice crystals were hardening the ground . Dolando asked a question with a stick of his own , and Jondalar elaborated on the drawing . Understanding was reached and they were all eager to get moving again . They broke into a jog , following the tracks . The fast pace warmed them , and hoods were loosened again . Jondalar 's long blond hair crackled and clung to the fur of his hood . It took longer than he expected to catch up , but when he sighted the reddish brown woolly rhinos ahead , he understood . The animals were moving faster than usua  --  nd straight north . Jondalar glanced uneasily at the sky ; it was a deep azure bowl inverted over them , with only a few scattered clouds in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brewing , but he was ready to turn back , get Thonolan , and get out . No one else seemed to have any inclination to leave , now that the rhinos were in sight . He wondered if their lore included the forecasting of snow by the northward movement of the woollies , but he doubted it . It had been his idea to go hunting , and he 'd had little difficulty communicating that ; now he wanted to get back to Thonolan and get him to safety . But how was he going to explain that a snowstorm was on the way when there was hardly a cloud in the sky , and he could n't speak the language ? He shook his head ; they 'd have to kill a rhino first . When they drew nearer , Jondalar dashed ahead , trying to outdistancethe last straggle  --  young rhino , not full grown and having a little trouble keeping up . When the tall man pulled ahead , he shouted and waved his arms , trying to get the animal 's attention to make him veer or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north with the same single-minded determination as the others , ig-133nored the man . They were going to have trouble distracting any of them , it seemed , and it worried him . The storm was coming faster than he thought . Out of the corner of his eye , he noticed that Jetamio had caught up with him , and he was surprised . Her limp was more noticeable , but she moved with speed . Jondalar nodded his head in unconscious approval . The rest of the hunting party were moving up , trying to surroundone animal and stampede the others . But rhinoceroses were not herd animals , sociable and easily led or stampeded , depending upon large numbers for safet  --  nd survival of their kind . Woolly rhinos were independent , cantankerous creatures , who seldom mingled in groups larger than a family , and they were dangerously unpredictable . Hunters were smart to be wary around them . By tacit agreement , the hunters concentrated on the young one laggingbehind , but the shouts of the rapidly closing group neither slowed him down nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took off her hood and waved it at him . He slowed , turned the side of his head toward the flutter , and seemed decidedly undecided . It gave the hunters a chance to catch up . They deployed themselves around the beast , those with heavy lances moving in closer , those with light spears forming an outer circle , ready to rush to the defense of the more heavily armed , if necessary . The rhino came to a stop ; he seemed unaware that the rest of his troupe were rapidly moving ahead . Then he started out at a rather slow run , veering toward the hood fluttering in the wind . Jondalar moved in closer to Jetamio , and he noticed Dolando doing the same . Then a young man , whom Jondalar recognized as one who stayed on the boat , waved his hood and rushed in front of them toward the animal . The confused rhino stalled his headlong run toward the young woman and , changing his direction , started after the man . The larger moving target was easier to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunters misled his acute sense of smell . Just as he was getting close , another running figure darted between him and the young man . The woolly rhino stalled again , trying to decide which moving target to follow . He changed direction and charged after the second who was so tantalizinglyclose . But then another hunter interceded , flapping a large fur cloak , and , when the young rhino neared it , still another ran past , so close he gave the long reddish fur on his face a yank . The rhinoceroswas getting more than confused ; he was getting angry , murderouslyangry . He snorted , pawed the ground , and , when he sawanother of those disconcerting running figures , tore after it at top speed . The young man of the river people was having difficulty staying ahead , and , when he swerved , the rhino swerved in fast pursuit . But the animal was tiring . He had been chasing one after another of the vexatious runners , back and forth , unable to catch up with any . When yet another hood-waving hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lowered his head until his large front horn touched the ground , and concentrated on the limping figure moving just beyond his reach . Jondalar raced toward them , his lance held high . He needed to make the kill before the winded rhino caught his breath . Dolando , approaching from another direction , had the same intention , and severalothers were closing in . Jetamio flapped her hood , warily moving closer , trying to keep the animal 's interest . Jondalar hoped he was as exhausted as he seemed . Everyone 's attention was riveted on Jetamio and the rhino . Jondalar was n't sure what caused him to look nort  --  erhaps a peripheral motion . " Look out ! " he cried , spurting forward . " From the north , a rhino " ' But his actions seemed inexplicable to the others ; they did n't understand his shouts . And they did n't see the enraged female rhinoceros bearing down on them full tilt . " Jetamio ! Jetamio ! North ! " he shouted again , waving his arm and pointing his spear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she screamed a warning to the young man the she-rhino was charging . The rest of them raced to help him , forgetting the young one for the moment . It may have been that he was rested , or that the scent of the charging female had revived him , but suddenly the young male rushed the personwaving a hood so provocatively close . Jetamio was lucky he was so close . He did n't have time to build up speed or momentum , and his snort as he began his advance snapped her attention back , and Jondalar 's as well . She threw herself back , dodging the rhino 's horn , and ran behind him . The rhinoceros slowed , looking for the target that had slipped away , and was n't focusing on the tall man who closed the gap with long strides . And then it was too late . The small eye lost all ability to focus . Jondalar rammed the heavy lance into the vulnerable opening and smashed it into the brain . The next instant , all his sight disappearedwhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other134 135 h. eye . The animal seemed surprised , then stumbled , fell to his knees , and , as life ceased to sustain him , dropped to the ground . There was a shout . The two hunters looked up and sprinted away at full speed in different directions . The full-grown female rhinoceros was hurtling toward them . But she slowed as she neared the young one , overran a few paces before she halted , then turned back to the young male lying on the ground with a spear bristling out of each eye . She nudged him with her horn , urging him to get up . Then she turned her head from side to side and shifted her weight from foot to foot as though trying to make up her mind . Some of the hunters tried to get her attention , flapped hoods and cloaks at her , but she did n't see or chose to ignore them . She nudged the young rhino again , and then , in answer to some deeper instinct , turned north once more . " I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that female was deter- mined to go nort  --  he did n't want to stay at all . " " You think snow is on the way ? " Thonolan asked , glancing down at his poultice , then back to his worried brother . Jondalar nodded . " But I do n't know how to tell Dolando that we 'd better leave before the storm comes , when there 's hardly a cloud in the sky ... even if I could speak their language . " " I 've been smelling snow on the way for days . It must be building up to a big one . " Jondalar was sure the temperature was still dropping , and knew it the next morning when he had to break a thin film of ice in a cup of tea that had been left near the fire . He tried again to communicate his concern , seemingly without success , and nervously watched the sky for more overt signs of weather change . He would have been relieved when he saw curdled clouds pouring over the mountains and filling up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the imminent threat they posed . At the first sign that they were breaking camp , he struck his own tent and packed his and Thonolan 's backframes . Dolando smiled and nodded at his readiness , then motioned him toward the river , but there was a nervousness to the man 's smile and deep concern in his eyes . Jondalar 's apprehension grew when he saw the swirling river and the wooden craft bobbing and jerking , straining at the ropes . The expressions of the men who took his packs and stowed them near the cut-up frozen carcass of the rhino were more impassive , but Jondalar did n't see much encouragement either . And for all that he was anxious to get away , he was by no means comfortable about the means of transportation . He wondered how they were going to get Thonolan into the boat , and he went back to see if he could help . Jondalar watched as the camp was dismantled with speed and efficiency , knowing that sometimes the best assistance one could offer was simply to stay out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details in clothing that differentiated those who had set up shelters on land , and referred to themselves as Shamudoi , from the Ramudoi , the men who stayed on the boat . Yet they did n't quite seem like different tribes . There was an ease of communication , with much joking , and none of the elaborate courtesies that usually indicated underlying tensions when two different peoples met . They seemed to speak the same language , shared all their meals , and worked well together . He noticed , though , that on land Dolando seemed to be in charge , while the men on the boat looked to another man for direction . The healer emerged from the tent , followed by two men carrying Thonolan on an ingenious stretcher . Two shafts from the grove of alder trees on the knoll were wound over and around with extra rope from the boat , forming a support between them to which the wounded man was securely lashed . Jondalar hurried toward them , noticing that Roshario had begun taking down the tall circular tent . Her nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not looking forward to the trip any more than he was . ' Those clouds look full of snow , " Thonolan said when his brother came into sight and started walking beside the litter . " You ca n't see the tops of the mountains ; snow must be falling up north already . I 'll say one thing , you get a different view of the world from this position . " Jondalar looked up at the clouds rolling over the mountains , hiding the frozen peaks , tumbling over each other as they pushed and shoved in their hurry to fill the clear blue space above . Jondalar 's frown looked almost as threatening as the sky , and his brow clouded with concern , but he tried to mask his fears . " Is that your excuse for lying around ? " he said , trying to smile . When they reached the log that was jutting out into the river , Jondalarfell back and watched the two river men balance themselves and their burden along the unsteady fallen tree and manhandle the stretcher up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmly lashed to the conveyance . He followed after , having trouble keeping his own balance , and looked at the men with even greater respect . A few white flakes were beginning to sift down from a gray overcastsky when Roshario and the Shamud gave tightly bound bundles137of poles and hide  --  he large ten  --  o a couple of the Ramudoi to carry on board and started across the log themselves.The river , reflectingthe mood of the sky , roiled and swirled violentl  --  he increasedmoisture in the mountains making its presence felt downstream . The log was bobbing to a different motion than the boat , and Jondalarleaned over the side and reached a hand toward the woman . Roshario gave him a grateful look and took it , and was almost lifted up the last rung and into the boat . The Shamud had no qualms about accepting his assistance either , and the healer 's look of gratitude was as genuine as Roshario 's . One man was still on shore . He released one of the moorings , then raced up the log and clambered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaving craft that was trying to pull away and join the current was restrained by only one line and long-handled paddles in the hands of the rowers . The line was slipped witha sharp jerk , and the craft jumped at its chance for freedom . Jondalar clung tightly to the side as the craft bobbed and bounced into the mainstream of the Sister . The storm was building rapidly and the swirling flakes reduced visibility . Floating objects and refuse traveled with them at varying speed  --  eavy water-soaked logs , tangled brush , bloated carcasses , and an occasional small iceber  --  aking Jondalar fear a collision . He watched the shore slipping by , and his glance was held by the stand of alder on the high knoll . Something , attached to one of the trees , was flapping in the wind . A sudden gust broke its hold and carried it toward the river . As it dropped , Jondalar suddenly realized that the stiff , dark-stained leather was his summer tunic . Had it been flapping from that tree all this time ? It floated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thonolan had been released from his stretcher and was propped up against the side of the boat , looking pale , in pain , and frightened , but he smiled gamely at Jetamio who was beside him . Jondalar settled near them , frowning as he remembered his fear and his panic . Then he recalled his incredulous joy when he first saw the boat approaching , and he . wondered again how they had known he was there . A thought struck him : could it have been that bloody tunic flapping in the wind that told them where to look ? But how had they known to come in the first place ? And with the Shamud ? The boat jounced over the rough water , and , taking a good look at its construction , Jondalar became intrigued by the sturdy craft . The bottom of the boat appeared to be made of a solid piece , a whole tree trunk hollowed out , wider at the midsection . The boat was madelarger by rows of planks , overlapped and sewn together , extending up the sides and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at intervals along the sides , and planks extended between them for seats for the rowers . The three of them were in front of the first seat . Jondalar 's eye followed the structure of the craft and skipped over a log that had been shoved against the prow . Then he looked back and felt his heart pound . Near the prow , caught in the tangled branches of the log in the bottom of the boat , was a leather summer tunic stained dark with blood. 138
