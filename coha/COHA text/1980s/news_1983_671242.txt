He still does . And yesterday , less than a day before he would become the first player selected in its annual collegiate draft , the National Basketball Association began clearing out a place for him. // The league sponsored a news conference for Sampson yesterday at the New York Statler Hotel , the first of what will likely to be more than two dozen such affairs around the country in the next few months as Sampson leads his newest team , the Houston Rockets , into the basketball spotlight. // " I am stepping into a mainstream that goes 100 miles an hour , " he said in a quiet tone . " I don ' t know how it will affect me . I ' m going to try and be low key . I just want to play basketball and be a member of a team. // " I know I ' ll have to approach it differently that I did in college . I ' ll have to adjust . But I won ' t be pushed into anything . I ' ll just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , he made it clear , will be Ralph Sampson ' s way . <> <> Discussions With Abdul-Jabbar // It ' s been 14 years since a young college center entered the N.B.A. with such a stir of interest . Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , then Lew Alcindor , left U.C.L.A. - where his time was largely his own - and fell into a scene that was frenetic and demanding . It was a time , he now says , that later affected his view of both the news media and the world. // Sampson and Abdul-Jabbar have spoken on several occasions in recent years . The center who has set new standards for his position offered his advice while the center who may yet set even higher ones listened. // Sampson did not divulge any details about those conversations yesterday , saying only : " It wasn ' t as if he told me ' this is for your own good ' or anything . " Nonetheless , there are already signs that he is following the pattern the veteran center established over the years by adopting some of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game - an exhibition last week in Norfolk , Va. - Sampson would not speak to reporters who approached him . And for the past several weeks - since it became apparent that the Rockets , basketball ' s worst team last season , would select him - he has refused to meet with a reporter from The Houston Chronicle who traveled from Texas in hopes of covering the best news that that franchise has had in years. // " I just didn ' t want things to get out of hand and out of proportion , " Sampson says . " I wanted to get my degree first , then do what any other college student would do - like go to the beach. " // However , Sampson several times has shifted from that position , and during the last few days has appeared both on radio and television . <> <> Stipanovich to Be Second Pick // Sampson is regarded as by far the prize of the draft . The No. 2 selection , by the Indiana Pacers , will be Steve Stipanovich , Missouri ' s 6-11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a result of a trade and , after a weekend of analysis , announced yesterday that they would take Louisville ' s 6-foot-7 1/2 forward Rodney McCray. // The other players most likely to be selected in the first half of the first round are Antoine Carr of Wichita State , Sidney Green of Nevada-Las Vegas , Russell Cross of Purdue , Dale Ellis of Tennessee , Thurl Bailey of North Carolina State , Darrell Walker of Arkansas , Byron Scott of Arizona State , Clyde Drexler of Houston and Leo Rautins of Syracuse. // The only guards among the most highly regarded players are Walker and Scott , the latter one of six undergraduates who left college before their eligibility expired . The others are Cross , Drexler , Derek Harper of Illinois , Glenn Rivers of Marquette and Ennis Whatley of Alabama. // Sampson will likely earn close to $750 , 000 in his first professional season , which will be the most ever by a rookie . But still , he is unfazed . When he was asked yesterday if he stayed awake at nights , wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " he said , smiling , " I haven ' t lost any sleep over it .
