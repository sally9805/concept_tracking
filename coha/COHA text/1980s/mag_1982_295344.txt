Fearing a coup plot , Mugabe dumps Nkomo from the Cabinet <P> For years they were rivals . But for the 24 months since the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front party ( ZANU-P.F. ) of Prime Minister Robert Mugabe came to power in 1980 , he and Joshua Nkomo , 64 , the portly , outspoken head of the opposition Zimbabwe African People 's Union ( ZAPU ) , have coexisted uneasily . Last week their shaky truce was shattered . Nkomo was unceremoniously stripped of his rank as Minister Without Portfolio in the Mugabe government , a post he was demoted to a year after Nkomo 's party won 20 parliamentary seats in the 1980 elections ( vs. 57 for Mugabe 's ) . The accusation against Nkomo : conspiring to overthrow the government by force of arms . <P> The occasion for Nkomo 's ejection from the Cabinet was the alleged discovery of arms caches on property owned or controlled by Nkomo and ZAPU in the Bulawayo area , in the southwestern part of the country . Government security forces unearthed other buried weapons and military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east . The arsenal included 25 SA-7 missiles , more than 7,000 Soviet-made automatic rifles , rocket-propelled grenade launchers , machine guns and more than 2 million rounds of ammunition . Said Mugabe : " The arms were being hoarded to try to overthrow my government . " <P> Police first grew suspicious when ZAPU insurgents , who had fought grudgingly alongside ZANU forces during their seven-year guerrilla war against the white-dominated , government of what was formerly Rhodesia , did not turn over all their arms as required when the strife ended in 1979 . After a series of armed robberies in the Bulawayo area last year , police arrested a number of former ZAPU guerrillas and persuaded them to reveal the location of the caches . <P> Mugabe also claimed that Nkomo held two secret meetings shortly after the 1980 elections with South African officials to seek Pretoria 's support for a coup attempt against Mugabe . The South Africans , charged Mugabe , refused Nkomo 's request at both meetings . The Prime Minister also maintained that Nkomo had met with " other parties " to plan a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Parliament Wally Stuttaford , 64 , who has been detained by the Mugabe government since December on suspicion of having approached ZAPU to plot a joint coup attempt . <P> Mugabe said ominously that " the law will now take its course " against Nkomo and dismissed three other key ZAPU party members , though he stopped short of firing four others . The apparent attempt to confine the sackings to a few ZAPU leaders for the moment undercut increasingly vocal complaints from opposition critics , especially among Zimbabwe 's 210,000 whites , that Mugabe is moving to establish a one-party state .
