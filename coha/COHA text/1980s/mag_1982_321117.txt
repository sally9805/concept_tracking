The Argentine military establishment had no trouble last week explaining why Britain was able to recapture the Falklands : massive U.S. military assistance . Despite the Reagan Administration 's declaration of support for Britain , Argentina 's accusation is based much more on diplomatic posturing than fact . British officials emphatically point out that almost all the assistance made available to Britain by the U.S. was the result of longstanding agreements within NATO . Whitehall officials say that at least 90% of the equipment used in the Falklands was British . " All these claims that U.S. technology won the Falklands war for Britain are nonsense , " says a senior British official , " It played a part , and we are very grateful for that , but it was not the decisive element in our victory . " Included in the military aid that the U.S. did supply : <P> Fuel . As part of a routine agreement , the U.S. sent 1.5 million gal . of aviation fuel to the joint U.S.-British airbase at Ascension Island . It also made KC-135 aerial tankers available to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic . Instead , the Royal Air Force used its own KC-135s for midair refueling of Vulcan bombers making the 3,800-mile trip from Ascension to the Falklands , while U.S. planes in Europe were reassigned to British NATO duties . <P> Ammunition . The U.S. sold Britain an unspecified quantity of 20-mm shells and supplied sonar-equipped buoys for use in antisubmarine warfare . Washington officials will not say if any of this equipment was ever used on the islands . <P> Missiles . The U.S. sold Britain about 100 AIM-9L Sidewinder missiles ( for $48,000 apiece ) . Of 27 Sidewinders fired by Harriers during the war , 23 scored hits . These , however , were most probably British missiles ; the U.S.-supplied Sidewinders were apparently used only to replenish inventories in Britain . Also supplied were highly effective laser target indicators for British ground forces and a radar system for the Royal Navy 's Sea wolf surface-to-air missiles . <P> Intelligence and Communications . As a NATO ally , Britain always had regular access to the U.S.-built Defense Satellite Communications System , which relays encrypted messages around the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although their effectiveness was severely limited by bad weather over the South Atlantic . <P> By no means did London get everything it wanted . Lacking an effective airborne early-warning system to protect its naval task force from surprise air attacks , the British asked to borrow an undisclosed number of U.S. AWACS . Washington refused on the grounds that American servicemen , who would be necessary to man the aircraft , should not become involved in the conflict . <P> Ironically , the most impressive weapon in the war came from Argentina 's arsenal : the French-built Exocet missiles , which sank the H.M.S. Sheffield . And in the final analysis , military experts agree , Argentina was defeated not by sophisticated weaponry but by the superior training , tactics and morale of the British forces .
