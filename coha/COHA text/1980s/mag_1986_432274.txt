@#  | I is 10 a.m. at New York 's Kennedy Airport : " Global Airways flight 2005 now departing from gate 11 , " says a voice over the PA system . At Los Angeles International Airport , it 's 7:42 a.m. when the following message is heard : " Global Airways flight 2005 now arriving at gate 17 . " Elapsed time from coast to coast : 12 minutes ; gate to gate : 42 minutes . That 's 15 minutes climbing , 15 minutes descending , and 12 minutes in between . Add another 20 to 30 minutes for the en route cruise at altitudes more than ti. i6. , fry , 30 miles high , and the same flight could have landed in Hong Kong or Sydney , Australia . That incredible aircraft , cruising just below the edge of space at speeds between Mach 15 and 25 , is the aerospaceplane , or transatmospheric vehicle . It 's no engineering pipe dream . President Reagan , in his February State of the Union address , said " we are going forward with research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new Orient Express . " The National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) and the Pentagon , already backed by a budget commitment from the White House , expect to begin flying an X-type ( experimental ) transatmospheric research plane  | within five or six years . It will fly somewhere between Mach 12 and Mach 25 . The plane wo n't carry more than a single test pilot . But it may begin carving a path through the fringe of space for commercial airliners ? and perhaps orbiting transports ? of the 21st century . As last month 's " Scramjets " article indicated , a Mach 5 or 6 plane could be attainable with air-turbo-ramjet engine technology , but present thinking is to leapfrog that stage . Turning the dream of hypersonic flight into reality , say experts involved in the program , is possible because of recent breakthroughs in both engine and materials technology and in the use of supercomputers . I talked with the key people pushing for aerospaceplane development in the U.S. and discovered that both research and development and the government 's quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British government 's spaceplane program , less ambitious than ours , moves quietly forward under tight security wraps . It is called HOTOL ( for horizontal takeoff and landing ) . In February , the Trade Ministry authorized $4.1 million more for HOTOL studies . " We have a whole new generation of materials , propulsion systems , and large computers under development or already in use at various research facilities , " a highly placed MAY 1986 175  | White House expert , who asked not to be named , told me . " All these are reaching maturity , and there is the potential for integrating them into a flying vehicle . But the reality is that there is great difficulty in making the formal decision . It 's all tied in with the budget process . The spaceplane will fly so long as it does n't inhibit space-station development . " There are , however , some negative voices in the aerospaceplane chorus . Some critics believe that we should be aiming first at an intermediate supersonic passenger plane , such as the 1,700-mph second-generation Concorde the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert John Steiner , who retired in 1983 as a vice president of Boeing and then served as chairman of the White House Aeronautical Policy Review Committee . He believes that airlines would go for a superfast supersonic aircraft to service the Pacific Rim , but that the real interest in hypersonic aircraft is military , not commercial . And John Pike , of the Federation of American Scientists , has said that the aerospaceplane makes sense for the backers of the Strategic Defense Initiative ( the Star Wars plan ) because it would lower the cost of space launches . But he questions whether there is really any other economical use for it . Nevertheless , much of the basic research needed to go ahead with a hypersonic research aircraft is in hand , most of it done at NASAs Langley Research Center , Virginia , which has quietly spent $4 million to $5 million a year on hypersonics for more than a decade . " We 've made sustained and steady progress , " said Lana Couch , NASA 's manager of the hypersonics program . " But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can choose a system and decide to develop it . By 1995 we will have laid the broad technology base that will make it possible for this country to build an operational hypersonic aircraft . " The U.S. aerospaceplane concept differs markedly from the British design . The basic version would be powered by scramjets , fly just below the edge of space at speeds higher than Mach 15 , and operate from traditional runways . A more advanced plane would add rocket power to give it the extra kick needed to go into orbit from its cruising altitude . Scramjet technology is a major key to the U.S. effort . " We 're not talking about ramjets burning methane to reach Mach 5 or 6 , " said the White House expert . " They do n't meet the demands of the spaceplane regime , and there 's no  | way those planes are going to fly out of the atmosphere . " Scramjets will be fueled by hydrogen and will draw their oxygen from outside air . Research at Langley already shows that scramjets can outperform rockets by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much detailed development work remains to be done . And now , for something completely different In contrast , the British HOTOL is to be powered by airbreathing rockets fueled by liquid oxygen and hydrogen . Those engines are a breakthrough in rocket technology , since they would draw oxygen from the atmosphere during much of the climb toward either cruising altitude or orbit . That reduces the amount of propellant that must be carried on board and , according to information released by British Aerospace Corp. , " permits the use of wings to optimize the initial flight trajectory after takeoff from a standard runway . " Details on how the revolutionary rocket engine works , however , are a closely held British secret . HOTOL also would use a simple trolley , which parts company with the craft at liftoff , for its takeoff role . Its design calls for a gliding shuttle-like landing on a lightweight undercarriage . It would be a relatively small spaceplane , with a payload of just seven tons ? less than one-fourth the shuttle 's capacity . So far , the British government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called simply " a launch vehicle for the 21st century . " Initial missions would be unmanned , intended to place satellites in orbit . But the British envision an airline-type passenger module that could be placed into its cargo bay for piloted trips from London to Sydney taking little more than an hour . " We respect the British as researchers , " the White House expert told me , " but there 's a real question about whether they have the wherewithal to pull it off . " No such question exists , at least in the minds of its advocates , about the U.S. aerospaceplane . The development program is run jointly by the Air Force , Navy , and NASA , and is headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base , Ohio . It has strong military overtones , particularly in terms of the aerospaceplane 's potential for servicing orbiting lasers as part of the president 's Strategic Defense Initiative . " It 's a single national program , " said SDI spokesman Brig . Gen. Robert R. Rankine . " The phase that begins in 1986 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and aerodynamics . " The latter is particularly crucial . Research already completed shows that an aerospaceplane 's shape is a vital element in making scramjet engines operate efficiently . The plane 's underbody must funnel air into the engine at exactly the right velocity and temperature . If the fuselage is designed properly , air heated to more than 4,000 degrees F by the plane 's forward motion will be slowed slightly , then funneled into the engine . Air temperature alone will ignite the hydrogen fuel . Much of the development yet to be done involves computational fluid dynamics ? the analytical field that studies how fast-moving fluids such as air act under conditions of high temperature and pressure . Only the advent of supercomputers makes the complex and lengthy calculations needed to design an aerospaceplane realistically possible . " It 's a real challenge in terms of engine integration with the airframe , " Rankine told me . " Supercomputers allow us to do complete calculations of the airflow for both internal and external aerodynamics . We can find solutions that  | look promising , then test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build and test , we can converge on a solumuch more rapidly . " The final design will be a delicate balance between airframe and engine design . " If the aerodynamicists want to change the spaceplane 's body to get performance , it could degrade the performance of the engine , " said NASA 's Couch . " There has to be a lot of cross talk here . " Tentative aerospaceplane designs already exist , prepared by aerospace companies under study contracts performed in recent years for the Air Force ( see illustrations ) . Actual in-flight data are also being analyzed today . The space shuttle Columbia carried three experiments directly related to aerospaceplane research during its January mission . Each was activated during its descent from orbit . The shuttle was fitted with a new nose cap containing cruciform orifices to provide continuous pressure readings as it @# POPULAR SCIENCE dropped from space to ground , with an infrared-sensor system to record a complete temperature map of its lee-side body and wing during hypersonic flight and with a mass spectrometer to sample the upper atmosphere . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data system that will automatically record the conditions in which a spaceplane or shuttle is flying , " Couch told me . Another " tall pole of technology ' ? favored Washington jargon for major areas still needing extensive research and development ? remains to be climbed . It is developing the lightweight , high-strength materials needed to let an aerospaceplane survive the extreme temperatures and pressures it will encounter . " Materials research will concentrate on extending the current state of the art on composites like carbon-carbon or carbon connected with something light like beryllium , " the White House expert told me . " Those materials are available today as laboratory test pieces , but not in the three-foot sections we need to build a test vehicle . " That means no breakthrough is needed . " We can base our work on existing materials and concentrate on further improvements , " Rankine said . Not too small , but not too big The development schedule agreed to by the Air Force , Navy , and NASA calls for the current phase to last three years and to include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs . If scientists and engineers succeed in climbing those tall poles , the team will ask the Reagan administration and Congress for funds to build a one-of-a-kind research aircraft . It could begin hypersonic flights in the early 1990s . " The research aircraft has to be large enough to demonstrate the technologies , and small enough so it 's not too expensive , " Couch said . Such a craft could be the most exciting X-type machine since the fabled X-15 . Its materials , shape , and engines will be the true forerunners of an operational aerospaceplane . " It 's the only way to demonstrate the things you ca n't do on the ground ? propulsion above Mach 7 and behavior of full-size thermal components , systems , and materials , " Couch said . If that phase stays on schedule , plans for an operational aerospaceplane ? with the potential for both commercial and military use ? could be laid before Congress in 1995 . " What we 're talking about here is an airplane , " Couch said . " It 's just one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that . "
