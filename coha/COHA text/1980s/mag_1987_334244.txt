The America 's Cup , yachting 's great and garish grail , is a tumorous tureen no handsomer than a camel . In 1983 the news was not only that it was lost but that it was losable . A 132-year winning streak , the longest in all sport , was broken over the ample shoulders of San Diego Skipper Dennis Conner , the best and unlikeliest sailor in the world . He means to win it back this week . <P> Throughout the century and a third of challenges , lately spaced three summers apart , the dandruffy commodores of the New York Yacht Club ( N.Y.Y.C. ) kept polishing the silverware and admiring their own mugs . " It 's a boat race , " Red Smith used to like to write in the New York Herald Tribune , " in the horse-racing sense of the term . " Meaning the result was pretty well arranged . If the rules were not rigged , they were at least geared for the defenders , whose original 1851 victory on the schooner America was dubious too. * When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a winged keel three years ago and relocated it in a western backwater near Perth , only a few millionaires with wet bottoms were very disappointed . Only Conner cried . <P> Conner is not a rich man , though . Furthermore , he says he does not like to sail . As a matter of fact , he can not swim . ( " I spend all of my time trying to stay out of the water . " ) No more enigmatic character presides over any sport . At the top of his game , Conner can eat with Nicklaus , drink with Namath , offend with McEnroe , spend with Marcos and lose with Napoleon . With a straight face , as brown and <P> supple as an underinflated football , he calls 12-meter racing his hobby . But nearly everyone on the dock seems to believe he has singlehandedly killed it as a pleasure sport . " The weekend sailor has been shoved out , " says Ted Turner , Captain Outrageous of 1977 . Tom Blackaller , one of the advocates of leisure caught in Conner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get him the hell out of sailing . I think he hurts it . " Conner sighs and explains , " What they 're saying is , ' If I were willing to give as much as Dennis does , I could be as good as he is . ' That 's just an excuse to lose . " <P> No Excuse to Lose is the title of Conner 's 1978 tome , which he modestly refers to as the Bible . In 1983 his explanation for the grandest seafaring indignity since Bligh went home in a dinghy was that the best crew lost to the best boat . " Design has taken the place of what sailing used to be , " he says . And now that Conner understands this , he does n't mind . " I do n't like to sail , " he says . " I like to compete . I guess I do n't dislike it , but my sailing is just the bottom line , like adding up the score in bridge . My real interest is in the tremendous game of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
