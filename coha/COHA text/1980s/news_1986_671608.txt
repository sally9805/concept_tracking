The judge , Gerhard A. Gesell , today canceled naturalization proceedings for 106 prospective citizens that were to have been held at the Jefferson Memorial as part of the nationwide ceremony on the evening of July 3. // The ceremony is part of a four-day celebration of Independence Day and the centennial of the Statue of Liberty . <> <> Capital Ceremony Rescheduled // Judge Gesell said that instead of the ceremony at the Jefferson Memorial he would hold a naturalization proceeding for the same people on the afternoon of July 3 in the ceremonial courtroom of the United States Courthouse here. // Chief Justice Warren E. Burger is to administer the oath of naturalization by television hookup that night from Ellis Island in New York to some 15 , 000 people in New York , Miami , St. Louis and San Francisco , but not to the group in Washington. // In a letter to the Immigration and Naturalization Service , Judge Gesell said he was distressed because immediately after the oath " one or more commercials are to be telecast into the court proceedings while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Turned Into a Pageant ' // " Thus , " he said , " our usual dignified naturalization court is being turned into a pageant over which I have no control as the presiding judge. " // Judge Gesell said the televised proceeding would violate some of the assurances he received in a letter on March 12 from Robert B. Neptune , district director here of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. // " The Court was advised in the March letter that the television program would be in good taste , which this is not , and that our normal procedures would be conducted , " Judge Gesell said . " Obviously this is not the situation now . " <> <> Producers Are Disappointed // Jonas Halperin , a spokesman for David L. Wolper , producer of the four-day celebration , said he was stunned and disappointed by Judge Gesell ' s withdrawal. // " You could have had these people on the steps of the Jefferson Memorial , " Mr. Halperin said . " It could have been seen by a billion and a half people around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the judges. " // Manuel L. Real , chief judge of the Federal District Court in Los Angeles , said in an interview today that he had also refused to participate in the televised naturalization ceremony that the producers of Liberty Weekend had wanted to hold in Dodger Stadium or the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum . " We are not in the entertainment business , " Judge Real said . <> <> Timing of Commercials // Naturalization proceedings were not scheduled for July 3 in Los Angeles because the Federal judges there expressed their concern at an early stage of planning for Liberty Weekend. // Aides to the Chief Justice said he knew of Judge Gesell ' s objections but did not know the timing of the television commercials in relation to the naturalization ceremony . Chief Justice Burger has strenuously resisted televising of Supreme Court proceedings. // Toni House , a spokesman for the Supreme Court , said , " We have been assured that there will be no commercial interruption of the proceedings " to be conducted by the Chief Justice on July 3 . However , Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson Memorial , as originally scheduled , was to continue after the Chief Justice finished his role. // Immigration officials said that Judge Gesell would have had to readminister the oath because under the law it is not valid unless given by a judge at the site where the aliens are naturalized . The oath will also have to be given again by judges in the other locations , except in New York. // Liberty Weekend was conceived with television in mind , and rights to cover key portions of it were sold exclusively to ABC-TV for $10 million . Mr. Wolper , the producer , maintains that it is essentially an entertainment event that could validly be sold to television. // ABC initially agreed to let its rivals cover nine minutes of news events including official speeches in the period from 8 P.M. to 11 P.M. on July 3 . After complaints from CBS , NBC and the Cable News Network , ABC allowed them to cover another seven minutes as well , including Chief Justice Burger ' s remarks . <> <> Commercials Called Necessary // Audrey Fecht , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment on Judge Gesell ' s withdrawal . Spokesmen for ABC said that all commercial time in the 17 1/2 hours of special programming scheduled for Liberty Weekend had been sold . But they refused to disclose the names of advertisers planning to run commercials after Chief Justice Burger ' s part in the naturalization cerermony. // Mr. Halperin said the commercials were necessary , but would not come at an inappropriate moment . " Who ' s going to break in for a commercial if Chief Justice Burger is on the screen ? " he asked . " What are they going to say ? ' Wait a minute , Chief , we want to do a McDonald ' s spot ' ? It ' s ludicrous. " // Judge Gesell said he originally understood that the televised portion of the naturalization ceremony would involve only the administering of the oath of citizenship by the Chief Justice . But he said , " As plans have proceeded , I have been advised that the telecast portion has been greatly expanded to include not only a series of speeches but arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ' This Is My Country . ' " <> <> ' Most Inappropriate ' // In view of all this , Judge Gesell said , " I have concluded that it will be most inappropriate to authorize televising of the naturalization service suggested for the Jefferson Memorial on July 3. " // Judge Gesell said that naturalization was " a formal court proceeding , " and he added : " Motions are made by the Government . The oath has to be administered in a particular way. " // In the oath of citizenship , an alien promises to support the Constitution of the United States and to renounce allegiance to " any foreign prince , potentate , state or sovereignty. " //
