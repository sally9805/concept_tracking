When working with chemically treated lumber , take precautions . To avoid ingesting dust or fibers wear a mask and goggles while sawing or sanding . Wash your hands before handling food after working with pressure-treated lumber . Don ' t burn waste pieces ; get rid of them with the usual trash. // The framework and joists for each section are made of 2-by-6-inch lumber ( which actually measures 1 1/2 by 5 1/2 inches ) with pieces nailed together as shown . Use rust-resistant nails only , preferably hot-dipped galvanized nails or stainless-steel nails . Note that the two long joists or frame pieces for each section are 48 inches long , but that the other joists and framing members are 42 inches long . These are spaced as shown , with 14 inches between each joist . This creates a rectangular framework that will be 48 by 45 inches . The 45-inch dimension was selected because it works out almost perfectly for the decking boards : eight boards will cover each section of decking , when you add in an eighth of an inch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumber to use is the kind usually referred to as radius edge or eased edge . This consists of boards that are 5 1/2 inches wide ( nominally sized at six inches ) and have edges slightly rounded off , as shown . When these boards are nailed in place with a slight gap between them they will create a pleasant-looking , slightly grooved finished deck that will not only drain better , it will also not have sharp edges that can cause splintering. // Radius-edge decking measures one full inch in thickness ( this is nominally sized 1 1/4-inch-thick lumber that has been planed down to one inch and is often referred to as five-fourths lumber ) . The gap between boards should be about an eighth of an inch ; as mentioned , this will allow eight deck boards to cover the 45-inch width of each section without need for trimming . The easiest way to establish a uniform gap between boards is to use a scrap piece of eighth-of-an-inch-thick hardboard or plywood as a spacer block . Hold this in place before positioning each board for nailing. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the frame , as well as to the framing joists . To prevent splitting the wood where nails must be driven in close to the end of each board , stand the nails on their head on a hard surface and tap lightly on the end with a hammer . This blunts the point slightly so it will be less likely to split the wood . Nail down deck boards with the cupped ( concave ) side facing down . If they are not cupped , examine the end grain and nail them down with the curved grain or growth rings facing down ( the top of the curve should be toward the top ) . // To provide a level , solid foundation you will need footings or piers , as shown . Footings should be placed where they will support the corners of each deck section , although adjoining sections can rest on the same footing. // You can make footings of concrete by digging holes in the ground and then pouring in concrete until the top surface is about level with the ground , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // If you pour concrete footings , they should be at least 6 inches thick and about 24 inches square , with steel reinforcing bars or mesh buried in the concrete . Using cement blocks is easier . Each block rests on a bed of compacted gravel six inches deep . The hole for the gravel should be deep enough so that the top of the concrete block will be about level with the surrounding soil. // When setting blocks in place , check positioning with a level , from front to back as well as from side to side . When all blocks are in place , use a tightly stretched line and a line level ( a miniature spirit level with hooks on top that enable it to be hung from a stretched line ) to make sure tops of blocks are level with one another. // When you set the deck sections in place , butt them firmly against one another and line them up neatly . To hold the deck assembly together , nail long lengths of 2-by-4 or 2-by-6 lumber around the perimeter . These trim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side flat against the outside framing and with the narrow top edge flush with the tops of the decking boards. // After the job is finished it is a good idea to apply a coat of clear water-repellent sealer to all exposed wood , especially on end grains . This will help prevent cracking and checking . If you want to apply a colored stain , put the stain on before the sealer is applied . But wait at least six weeks before applying any stain . When the stain dries , apply the sealer , unless the stain has a water-repellent sealer in it. //
