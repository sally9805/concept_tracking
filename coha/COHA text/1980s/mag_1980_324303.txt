Royal Siren . <P> GLADYS , DUCHESS OF MARLBOROUGH by Hugo Vickers Holt , Rinehart &; Winston ; 308 pages ; $12.95 <P> One of the great lessons of fairy tales is to mind what one wishes for : one may get it . In 1895 a schoolgirl named Gladys Deacon read about the marriage of the reluctant Consuelo Vanderbilt to the Duke of Marlborough and determined that some day she too would marry well . <P> Gladys had no reason to think of marriage as a binding contract . Her own parents , part of that affluent late Victorian world of American expatriates , parted in sensational circumstances when her father shot her mother 's lover dead in the Hotel Splendide in Cannes . <P> Gladys was eleven when it happened . <P> At 16 , with a beauty made disturbing by her blazing blue eyes , she was already a siren . Her conversation shone , her profile was just short of perfection . To make it impeccably Grecian , she had wax injected at the bridge of her nose . As the years passed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weird , mutilated beauty survived . <P> She had many admirers during her 25-year campaign to marry Marlborough when he and Consuelo were divorced . The art critic Bernard Berenson was mesmerized by the teen-age Gladys , and his wife , though jealous , felt the same . " She is radiant and sphinxlike ... Enchanting , but tiring . A wonderful creature , but too much of a born actress to take quite seriously . But so beautiful , so graceful , so changeful in a hundred moods , so brilliant that it is enough to turn anyone 's head , " she wrote , adding perceptively that " part of her mysteriousness comes from her being , as it were , sexless . " There were other flaws . Gladys was a liar , cruel , selfish , perverse , vulgar . <P> Her friendships , though ardent , usually ended in disappointment . The philosopher Count Hermann von Keyserling begged her to marry him , but she danced mockingly out of reach . The poet Hugo von Hofmannsthal , who saw in her " something of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she caused him " a mysterious and sometimes very painful feeling of needing . " Proust , Montesquiou , Rodin , Rilke , Giraudoux and George Moore were all bewildered or enslaved . <P> Gladys had plentiful suitors with blue blood and fortunes too : the Crown Prince of Germany , three noble Romans , the venerable Duke of Norfolk , who got down on all fours at her order to play dog , and the Duke of Connaught , the late Queen Victoria 's son , whom she dismissed in a letter full of " cruel and seething words . " <P> She had to wait until 1921 , when she was 40 and he 49 , for the Duke of Marlborough , a surly little man who hated " Yanks " but married two . His obsession was Blenheim Palace , and Gladys soon found she had married a house . As duchess , Gladys pruned roses , cultivated a rock garden full of snakes , and bred spaniels in the state rooms . Ennui soon turned to hatred . One night during a dinner party she placed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she meant to do with it . " Oh ! I do n't know , I might just shoot Marlborough . " <P> He died before he could divorce her . <P> Her marriage , she later wrote , was " like a black heavy cloud leaving such a disgusted pain that for years &; even now I can not bear to even brush by it in thought .
