In many ways , it was the central struggle of the 1984 Democratic race in the South , where Mr. Mondale ' s share of the black vote was enough to keep him alive . Four years later the script is very different. // Ten days before voters in 14 Southern and border states go to the polls on March 8 , few shots have been fired in the battle for the black vote , which a New York Times/CBS News Poll indicates will be about a third of the total Democratic turnout. // It is universally assumed that Mr. Jackson has already won that battle. // // White Candidates ' Quandary // The chief concern of Mr. Jackson is not winning black votes but getting black voters to the polls on Super Tuesday at a time when his candidacy no longer has the novelty and the movement fervor it had in 1984 . And his white rivals have built their strategy around the assumption that only a small proportion of the black electorate is open to their entreaties. // In general , they seem to have sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach widely viewed as futile or counterproductive , and giving the appearance of writing off black Democrats , which could be crippling to the eventual Democratic nominee. // They say they are ceding nothing , only being realistic . " Given that black voters are such a fundamental part of our general election coalition , we ' ve always felt it was imperative that we compete in the black community , " said William Carrick , campaign manager for Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri . " But we ' ve never been naive enough to think we ' d be able to translate that into a lot of votes in a primary context. " // Here in Atlanta , where black politicians are accustomed to hard-fought battles for the Democratic nomination , some say there has been remarkably little campaigning for black support so far . " I think there has been , in great part , a ceding of the black vote to Jesse , " said Bill Campbell , an Atlanta City Councilman . Former Mayor Maynard Jackson said white candidates are campaigning for black support " only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' // " The reality is these people are faced with limited resources and tough choices , " Maynard Jackson said . " And they more than likely are not going to spend money where they think the results will be leanest. " // Some analysts suggest that such an attitude is self-fulfilling . But most of them note that the polls have consistently shown Jesse Jackson with overwhelming support among blacks , creating less than fertile territory for rival campaigns. // " He really is good , " said Mayor Andrew Young of Atlanta , who supported Mr. Mondale in 1984 and often clashed with Jesse Jackson . " He ' s expressing the things that they want said . And the second thing is that nobody else has courted them . " Mayor Young added , however , " It may be that even if they courted them , they wouldn ' t have won them away. " // Donna Brazile , deputy campaign manager for Mr. Gephardt , tells a story to illustrate the political reality confronting white Democratic candidates in the South this year . Ms. Brazile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said her mother lit a candle for her daughter ' s candidate before the Iowa caucuses , and again before New Hampshire . But when the race moved to the South , Ms. Brazile was informed that the candle and the prayers were reserved for Mr. Jackson . <> <> ' They Love Him ' // " Jesse ' s spent his life cultivating this vote in the South , " said Ms. Brazile , who worked for Mr. Jackson ' s 1984 campaign . " He ' s marched in every march . He ' s prayed in every church . They love him , and we can not change that dynamic in 1988. " // In 1984 , Mr. Mondale managed to hold Mr. Jackson to 47 percent of the black vote in Alabama and 61 percent in Georgia , according to New York Times/CBS News polls of people who had just voted . But he had a long history of support in civil rights circles and the backing of such leaders as Mr. Young , Mayor Richard Arrington of Birmingham , Ala. , and Coretta Scott King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr . This year , many black leaders sent the signal early that they would back Mr. Jackson , given his overwhelming popularity among their constituents. // Other key players from 1984 , including Mr. Young , have chosen to stay neutral . Mr. Arrington ' s political organization is backing Mr. Jackson , but the Mayor himself will be out of the country on city business on March 8. // Still , even if only 10 to 20 percent of the black vote is available to white candidates this year , as many politicians believe , it could be critical in close races . So the white candidates have sought endorsements from black political leaders , sent black supporters out to preach their virtues , and worshiped in black churches . <> <> Gore a Second Choice // Senator Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee , for example , plans to visit two black churches in Atlanta on Sunday and meet with black political leaders . He succeeded in getting a " second choice " endorsement from an influential black political group , the Alabama Democratic Conference - its first choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious and political leaders not yet committed to Mr. Jackson. // Mr. Gore , whose campaign strategy rests on a strong showing in the South , has come close to directly challenging Mr. Jackson in recent days , criticizing his lack of experience in government. // The campaign of Gov . Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts has done even less overt campaigning in the black community so far . As of Friday , he had held 13 open events in the South since the New Hampshire primary ; none was aimed at a black audience , according to the campaign . But black legislators , businessmen and academics from Massacusetts have been working the South on Mr. Dukakis ' s behalf. // Mr. Dukakis has also sent such signals as the depositing of campaign money in black-owned banks. // " We ' re very conscious that Reverend Jackson is going to get the majority of the black vote , " said Debbie Willhite , Southern operations director for the Dukakis campaign . " Our goal has been to identify and promote our support among those blacks who are looking for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ms. Brazile of the Gephardt campaign argued , " I believe that to the extent we can fill in the blanks over the next few days , we ' ll be well positioned to pick up that 10 to 15 percent that ' s still not with Jesse . " Gephardt aides argue that their candidate ' s message about lost jobs and the trade imbalance should have an impact in the black community. // The challenge before the Jackson campaign is to turn out enough supporters to win outright victories in much of the South . So far , some politicians say , the fervor of 1984 , when the Jackson candidacy seemed more a movement than a campaign , has yet to appear . Nor does the race have the drama and intensity of the Mondale-Jackson competition that spurred turnout in black communities in 1984. // " My theory ' s always been that the black vote is no different from the white vote - you got to spend bucks to get it out , " said Al LaPierre , executive director of the Alabama Democratic Party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Mondale was pumping a ton of money into the black community , and you had the historical significance of Jesse ' s run. " // Gerald Austin , Mr. Jackson ' s campaign manager , acknowledged " There ' s always less enthusiasm the second time . " But Jackson supporters say they are hoping to make up in organization what might be lacking in zeal , even though their paid staff in the South is only a third the size of Mr. Dukakis ' s. // Some black politicians say Mr. Jackson ' s base will be mobilized , regardless of any shortcomings of his campaign . Representative John Lewis of Georgia noted that Mr. Jackson is on the cover of Ebony Magazine this month , and is prominently featured in black newspapers . " The message will come out throught the pulpits , through different clubs and neighborhood groups , " Mr. Lewis said. // Michael Lomax , chairman of the Fulton County Commission , said : " Every church , on the Sunday before , is going to be preaching vote . And I can ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won ' t be spoken. " //
