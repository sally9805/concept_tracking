Delegates to the international convention of the powerful Teamsters Union are not used to sitting through scoldings from their guest speakers , especially from one appointed by a President who has twice won their endorsement . But a scolding is precisely what some 2,000 Teamsters representatives got from Labor Secretary William Brock as they gathered in Las Vegas last week . Listing " mobbed-up locals " and " pension-fund abuse " as just two of the union 's problems , the Labor Secretary bluntly declared that the Teamsters have " lost a great deal of public trust . " Brock , who served as chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1977 to 1981 , went so far as to warn the Teamsters that they have " some of the same problems " that plagued G.O.P. leaders during the historic Watergate crisis . Brock carefully refrained from including on that list of problems the recent indictment on racketeering charges of Teamsters President Jackie Presser , on the ground that his innocence must be presumed until he is found guilty in court . Whether for that well-taken point  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight- talking Labor Secretary a standing ovation . Then , getting back to business as usual , the Teamsters overwhelmingly re-elected Presser to a five-year term .
