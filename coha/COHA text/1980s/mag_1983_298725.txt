As Begin 's likely successor , Shamir faces formidable problems <P> The wall behind the stage in the Tel Aviv theater was decorated with huge Israeli flags , framing pictures of two Zionist heroes , Vladimir Jabotinsky and Theodor Herzl . Oddly , there was no photograph of Menachem Begin . Nor was the Prime Minister present as 950 members of the Herut Party gathered last week to elect his successor in a boisterous , eight-hour-long session . If the attention of an anxious nation had been riveted on Begin while he debated whether to resign , Israelis seemed determined , once that decision was made , to move into the new and uncertain post-Begin era without looking back . <P> Whenever the outgoing Prime Minister 's name was mentioned from the speaker 's podium , the noisy crowd of Herut loyalists erupted with cheers of " Begin , Begin . " But as the long night of ballot counting passed , the name Shamir began to be heard more often . By 1:40 a.m. , the decision was official . Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir , 67 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Deputy Prime Minister David Levy , 45 , by 436 votes to 302 . The rapid sequence of events that had started with Begin 's sudden announcement that he would resign seemed to have stunned Shamir . " I do n't think he is hungry for the job , " confided an aide . But the new leader of the Herut Party , the largest group in the Likud bloc , moved decisively to assure Israelis that the transition would be swift and smooth . Shamir said that one of his immediate goals would be " the consolidation and expansion of the political achievements already reached . " <P> Shamir 's first challenge will be to hold together the Likud coalition , a fragile alliance of seven factions . His political mettle will also be tested by a formidable list of domestic and foreign problems . Not only have the deaths of 517 Israeli soldiers in Lebanon over the past year failed to guarantee peace , but the price tag for the occupation of Lebanon comes to more than $1 million a day . This burden comes at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign debt has reached $20.9 billion . Israel has also gone through a testy period in its relations with the U.S. because of last year 's invasion of Lebanon and Israel 's refusal to consider the Middle East peace plan proposed by President Reagan .
