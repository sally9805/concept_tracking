57 Up the Volga with the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship . NEVER did get it , what this trip was all about . 1 Pushkin staring out at the vast rolling shore of I stood at the rail of the cruise ship A leksandr the Volga . Here or there was a patch of grain , not high enough even in late July to conceal the line of furrows plowed straight downhill in the most erosion-producing way possible . And here or there was a skinny cow in an untidy hectare of pasture . But most of the land looked empty , unsown , ungrazed , uncultivated . And all around me were minds just as fallow . I was on something called the " Volga Peace Cruise , " a sixteen-day trip to the U.S.S.R. featuring a nine-day boat ride from Rostov north up the Don , through the Don-Volga canal , and on up the Volga River to Kazan . The 160 passengers were all Americans . Most were antinuke activists and peace-group organizers with Sixties-leftover looks . Others were products of the Old Left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of atomic holocaust . The leftists talked about peace , mostly in terms of Soviet-American relations . The entire program of the " peace cruise " consisted in the bunch of us talking about peace . And the Soviet government had provided five Russian " peace experts " to talk about peace too . Friday , July 16 , 1982 I WAS attracted to the Volga Peace Cruise by a half-page advertisement in the February 27 , 1982 , issue of the Nation magazine . It read , in part , " Find out for yourself what 's going on in the Soviet Union capital and heartland as you join The Nation this summer on an ex citing , affordable Soviet excursion . " I have a sneaking love of the old-time Left and that compendium of their snits and quarrels , the Nation . Mind you , I 'm a registered Republican and consider socialism a violation of the American principle that you should n't stick your nose in other people 's business except to make a buck . Still , Wobblies , Spanish Civil War veterans , the Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth , I 'd never met any Old Leftists . I expected them to be admirable and nasty , like Lillian Hellman. or brilliant , mysterious . denying everything , like Alger Hiss , or  --  best of all  --  hard-bitten and cynical but still willing to battle oppression , like Rick in Casablanca . I did not expect them to be the pack of thirty fussing geriatrics I met at Kennedy Airport , misplacing their hand luggage , losing their way to the ladies ' room , barking at the airline personnel , and asking two hundred times which gate we 'd have to be at in three and a half hours . They were progressives , all right . In between palsies of fretting . they 'd tell you how wonderful the Soviet Union was : pensions were huge , housing was cheap , and they practically paid you to get medical care . Believe me , you have n't been bored until you 've been buttonholed by a seventy-year-old woman who holds forth all afternoon on the perfidity of American foreign policy and shows you pictures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Union was perfect , but they were bringing their own toilet paper .

" 1111111 Saturday , July 17 The ad had promised excitement , and surely entering the Soviet Union would be exciting . The Russians are famous for making border crossing an exciting event . But we just stood in line for four hours . " You can understand the delay , " said a lady who had complained all night about everything on the flight to Moscow . " So many reactionary forces are trying to destroy the Soviet Union . " If reactionary forces are vulnerable to understaffing and inept baggage handling , they do n't stand a chance at the Moscow airport . There was only one faint thrill when we handed in our passports to the officer in the little glass passport-control booth . He was maybe seventeen , with a tunic too large around the neck and a hat too big by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Num ? Fuss num ? Plas oaf burf ? Dat oaf burf ?

" " Reason leaf ? " he yelled . I swear she sounded embarrassed . " I do n't know . My parents did it . " Then we got on a smoky , gear-stripped bus and rode past blocks of huge , clumsy apartment buildings and then more blocks of huge , clumsy apartment buildings , and then more blocks of huge , clumsy apartment buildings ; through the smoggy Moscow twilight , through half-deserted streets . " Some people , " said a progressive lady with orange hair and earrings the size of soup tureens , " say the Soviet Union 's depressing . I do n't know how they can say that . " We pulled up in front of an immense glass curtain-walled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I headed for the bar . It was pretty much like any bar in a Grand Hyatt . There was a big drunk man there , red-faced and bloated . He seemed to speak English . At least he was yelling at ? the bartender in it . " A glass of schnapps , " he said . He got vodka . " How long you been here ? " I said . " Hahahahahahaha , " he said , " I 'm from Frank-furt ! " " Scotch , " I said to the bartender . " Where 've you been ? " I asked the drunk . The bartender gave me vodka . " Fucking Afghanistan ! " said the drunk . Afghanistan ? Here was some excitement . " Afghanistan ? " I said , but he fell off his stool . Sunday , July 18 Y TOUR GROUP of progressives met with another three or four groups in the Moscow hotel . The others were mostly peace- niks . I do n't know how my group got involved in the peace cruise or how I got put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nation . " The Nation prints too much anti-Soviet propaganda , " said a potbellied man smoking a pipe with a stupid bend in the stem . In fact , there was no one from the Nation on the cruise except one assistant editor in the book-review department . The excursion ad had run , I found out later , in large part because the Nation received a commission for each passenger it signed up . The ad had listed a number of other sponsors : the Fellowship of Reconciliation , National Council of American-Soviet Friendship , Promoting Enduring Peace , Women 's International League for Peace and Freedom , and the World Fellowship League . A few passengers in the other tour groups were from those organizations , but most seemed to be representing tiny peace organizations of their own . And , if you did n't stick a sock in their mouths right away , they 'd tell you all about it . First , however , a visit to Lenin 's tomb . It 's real dark and chilly in there , and you march around three sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit to the nocturnal-predators section at the Reptile House with your grade school class  --  no talking ! " He has the face of a poet , " said our beautiful Intourist guide , Marya . He certainly does , a nasty , crazed , bigoted face just like Ezra Pound 's . None of the progressives so much as sniffled . This offended me . I can get quite misty at the Lincoln Monument . And I had to explain who John Reed was when we walked along the Kremlin wall . " Oh , that 's right , " said the orange-haired lady , " Warren Beatty in Reds . " Today she wore earrings that looked like table lamps . " Is n't it wonderful ? " she said , presenting Red Square as if she 'd just knitted it . " No crowds ! " The square was cordoned off by soldiers . Back to the hotel for another big drink . We spent the rest of the day on a Soviet version of a Gray Line tour , visiting at least thirty places of no interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Grand . Army of the Republic The route of the " Volga Peace Cruise . " 59 memorials or like low-income federal housing proects without graffiti . There are a few exceptions left over from the czars , but they need to have their lawns mowed . Every fifteen feet there 's a monument ? monuments to this , monuments to that , monuments to the Standing Committee of the Second National Congress of Gypsum and Chalk Workers . Marya narrated , " In the foreground is a monument to the monument in the background . " During a brief monument lacuna , Marya said , ? " Do any of you have questions that you would like to ask about the Soviet Union ? " " Where can I get a ... " But the others beat me to it . " What is the cost of housing in the Soviet Union as a percentage of worker wages ? " " What is the retirement age in the Soviet Union ? " " What pension do retired Soviet workers receive as a percentage of their highest annual work-life salary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union ? " " What about unemployment ? " Marya answered , pointed out a few more monuments , and asked , " Do any of you have other questions you would like to ask about the Soviet Union ? " Exactly the same person who 'd asked the first question asked exactly the same question again . I thought I was hearing things , " What is the cost of housing in the Soviet Union as a percentage of worker wages ? " And that flipped the switch . " What is the retirement age in the Soviet Union ? " " What pension do retired Soviet workers receive as a percentage of their highest annual work-life salary ? " " Is higher education free in the Soviet Union ? " Marya answered the questions again . The third time it happened she began to lose her composure . I could hear her filling up empty places in the sightseeing landscape . " Look , there 's a building ! And there 's another ! And over there are several buildings together ! And here ' sigh of relief are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF the bus questioners stood next to me as we waited to board our flight to Rostov . She looked out at the various Aeroflot planes standing on the tarmac and managed a statement that was at once na  --  ve , gratuitous , patronizing , and filled with progressive ardor . " Airplanes ! " she said . " The Soviet Union has thousands and thousands of airplanes ! " I never did find out what this lady looked like . She was only about four foot eleven , and all I ever saw was a skull-top of hennaed hair with a blur of fast-moving jaw beneath it . She had that wonderful ability some people have of letting their minds run right out their mouths . The peaceniks , especially the older peaceniks , were more visually interesting than the progressives . Somebody ought to tell a sixty-year-old man what he looks like in plastic sandals , running shorts , and a mint-green T-shirt with Kenneth Patchen poems silk-screened on the front . The peaceniks were sillier-acting than the progressives , too . There was a pair of Quaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not Quakers as one usually pictures them . They had " gone Hollywood . " Imagine a Quaker who came up to you in the L.A. airport and tried to get a donation for a William Penn button . Not that they did that , but it always looked to me as though they were about to . Anyway , this couple bore different last names . When we got aboard the ship in Rostov , a passenger went to return a book to the husband . " I 'm sorry , " said the wife at their cabin door . " He 's not here . " " But ca n't I give the book to you ? " asked the passenger . " It belongs to your husband . " " We 're not the same person , " said the wife . Tuesday , July 20 Fortunately there were other people to talk to . Actually , you could n't talk to most of them because they were Russians and did n't speak English  --  what you might call a silent majority . On the plane to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He spoke only a bit of English but was a good mime . He got it across that he was an engineer . I got it across that I was an American . He seemed very pleased at that . I should come and stay with his family . I explained about the cruise boat , showing him a picture of it on the brochure . I did a charade to the effect that I 'd better stick close to the boat . He gave me an engineering trade magazine ( in Russian , no illustrations ) , and I gave him some picture postcards of New York . We parted in a profusion of handshakes at the Rostov airport . The boat stayed at the dock in Rostov until midnight Tuesday . They have plenty of monuments in Rostov , too , and tour buses were lined up on the quay . I could hear someone asking inside one of them , " What is the cost of housing in the Soviet Union as a percentage of worker wages ? " I was lust being herded into that bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come on , " he gestured . I escaped down the embankment . We got on a boat packed to the scuppers with Russians and went for a two-hour excursion on the Don . Ivor bought a bottle of champagne and began a labored explanation punctuated with hand-wavings and flurries of picture-drawing in my reporter 's notebook . His father had been on the front lines when the armies of the East and West had met in Germany in 1945 . Apparently the Americans had liberated every bottle of alcoholic beverage between Omaha Beach and the Oder-Neisse Line and really made the welkin ring for their Red comrades in arms . " Anglish  --  poo , " said Ivor , " Francis  --  poo , " but the Americans , they were fine fellows , plenty of schnapps , plenty of cognac , plenty of vino for all . And they could drink , those American fine fellows . So Ivor 's " vada " had made him promise ( point to self , hand on heart ) if ( finger in air ) Ivor ever met American ( handshake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drink . Da ? ( Toast , handshake , toast again , another handshake . ) Standing behind Ivor was a giant man well into his sixties , a sort of combination Khrushchev and an old Arnold Schwarzenegger . He was staring hard at me , cocking an ear to my foreign language . He wore an undershirt and a suit coat with a line of medals out across the breast pocket . " Deutsch ? " he asked me sternly . " Nyetileutsch , " I said , " American . " He beamed , I mean just beamed . " Ally ! " he said . It was his only English word . He pulled out a wallet with what I guess were commendations and an honorable discharge . " Arnerikanskii ally ! " he said and slapped my shoulder . Eight-ounce glasses of brandy must be bought for Ivor and me . I toasted him with my only Russian word , " Toyarishch ( comrade ) ! " He brought forth a tiny grandson and had him shake hands with me . " Now the little one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less explained . I toasted the big guy again . He pledged a long toast in return , and , as I understood Ivor 's translation , we 'd drunk to the hope that America and Russia would be allies again in a war against China . I bought more cognac . Ivor bought beer . The big fellow bought even more cognac . When the boat docked Ivor and I went to a beer hall , a basement where they lined up half-liter mugs and squirted them full with a rubber hose from four feet away . Everyone grabbed half a dozen mugs at a time and drank one after the other while standing at long wooden tables . There was no communication problem now . We discussed women ( " Ah , beautiful . Oh , much trouble " ) , international politics ( " Iraq  --  poo . Iran  --  poo " ) , the relative merits of socialism versus a free-market system ( " Socialism  --  enough responsible , nyet fun . Capitalism  --  nyet enough responsible , plenty fun " ) , and , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  poo , too long " ) . Then we went to another bar on top of a Russian tourist hotel and had even more to drink . I did n't want to let my side down . And there were Ivor 's father 's feelings to be considered . Ivor and I embraced , and I staggered back to my cabin to pass out . The woman with her brains between her teeth was standing at the top of the gangplank . " I hope you 're not one of those people who 's going to see the Soviet Union through the bottom of a vodka glass , " she said . The Enemy Among Us F COURSE , we had plenty of Russians aboard the boat , too . There were five of the advertised experts . I 'll change their names in case some reconstructed quote or poetic exaggeration of mine is misconstrued to mean that one of these Soviets might be " turned " by the CIA . No one deserves to be pestered by surreptitious Yalies who could n't get into law school . Two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blonde woman of about forty . She did n't have much to say . Nikolai was a sturdy guy in his mid-thirties , completely Western in dress and manner . He had lived as a foreign correspondent in Switzerland and Austria for seven years , wore a bush jacket like any other foreign correspondent , and was as bluff and harddrinking as any newspaper man . I gathered this was n't much of an assignment . A third expert . Orlonsky , was a sinister-looking type with a half-Russian , half-Tartar face and slit-like eyes . He turned out to be a bored economist from the Soviet Institute of U.S. and Canadian Studies who was along to brush up on his English in preparation for some academic conference he was going to visit in San Francisco . But Orlonsky seemed to be a look-alive fellow . He wanted to talk about America 's marvelous demand-side goods-distribution system and did our economic institutes have screws loose or what ? Also . where did our automobile industry go ? But the Americans wanted to talk about peace and Soviet-American relations . Two more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sciences Institute " Perhaps they are just old , a bit , " said Sonya with the air of someone making an obviously fallacious argument . " But , " she brightened , " they are very for peace . " " Yes , " I agreed . " They are progressive . They are highly progressive . They are such great progressives I think I have almost all of them talked into defecting . " " No , no , no , no , no , " said Nikolai . Much later Wednesday morning , July 21 We docked on a scruffy island somewhere up near Volgodonsk . Most of the Americans took walks and got lost , but it was not as large an island as I could have hoped . One of the U.S.- peace experts , a pacifist from the American Friends Service Committee , got up a volleyball game against the crew . " Now let 's play and let 's play hard , " he told the American team . " But do n't forget we 're playing for fun . " The Russians trounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkened fantail , where they had dozens of bottles of beer , cheese , bread , and a huge salted fish . Sonya was concerned about my Republicanism . " You are not for peace ? " she asked . " I during Vietnam War struggle for peace very much talk with the Russians for a while and you fall into it too , rioting for peace , fighting police for peace , tear-gassed for peace , " I said . " I am tired of peace . Too dangerous . " Orlonsky began to laugh and then shook his head . " Vietnam  --  too bad . " " Land war in Asia , " I said . " Very bad . And some countries do not learn from an example . " All of them laughed . " And in Middle East , " said Sonya , mirthfully pointing a finger at me , " some people 's allies do not learn also . " " War is very bad , " said Nikolai . " Maybe U.S. and Soviet Union go to war over Lebanon  --  ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea . The Russians all but fell out of their chairs . " With all of Middle East how do you pick only ally without oil ? " said Orlonsky . I said , " With all of Europe how do you pick Poland ? " " You wish to make trade ? " said Nikolai . " Also , in deal , you can have South Africa , " I said . " We will tell Reagan you are a progressive , " said Orlonsky . " P. Cheh P.J.J was making faces at our news broadcast today . I do not think he is a progressive . " " Oh , he is a progressive , " said Nikolai . " You remember , Sonya , he has almost all Americans on ship ready to defect . " Marya made a strangled noise in the back of her throat . Sonya turned very sober . " Progressives , " she sighed . " Everything must be made perfect for them . " Thursday , July ' 22 UR FIRST scheduled peace conference took place while we sailed through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , broad , overvigorous American woman in her sixties . Let 's call her Mrs. Pigeon so she wo n't sue , and also because too very much truth does n't go with travel writing . Mrs. Pigeon was an authority on the education of children , and , in fact , had the personality of a teacher  --  the sort of teacher who inspires any feeling child to sneak back in school at night and spray-paint the halls with descriptions of the human love act . Mrs. Pigeon introduced the Soviet experts and their two American counterparts , Reverend Bump-head ( not his real name ) and the volleyball coach , Nick Smarm ( not his real name ) . Nick was a politician , but the sort who would run for city council in Youngstown on an antidevelopment , pro-ecology ticket . He smiled too much . The Reverend Bumphead was a young man of Ichabod Crane lank . I never caught his denomination . My guess is Zen Methodist . He was either growing a beard or else he did n't know how to shave . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me back through twenty-five years to the vile confines of the fourth grade . The peaceniks took notes . I had a vision of newsletters , reams and reams of misstapled copier paper Xeroxed when the boss was n't looking , spewing forth from the tepid organizations these people represented . " My Interesting Peace Voyage Through the Soviet Union " ; " An Interesting and Enjoyable Visit to the U.S.S.R. With Peace in Mind " ; " Not War and Peace but Peace and Peace " ( one of the clever ones ) ; " Peace in the Soviet Union and an Interesting Trip There Too . " Maybe America could be bored into nuclear disarmament . Nick Smarm began to speak . It was the standard fare . He laid the greater part of the blame for a potential international nuke duke-out on the American doorstep . What he was saving was n't wrong , at least not in the factual citations he made . But suddenly and quite against my will I was angry . To HARP ER'S/ NOVE B ER 1982 stand in front of strangers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't care if what Nick said was generally true ; I did n't care if what he said was wholly , specifically , and exactly true in every detail . I was ashamed of the man . I would have been ashamed if he were Russian and we were on the Mississippi . That big fellow with the medals down his suit coat , my ally , he would n't have done such a thing on the Delta Queen . I needed a drink . When I returned , Reverend Bumphead from the Princeton Coalition for Disarmament was speaking . He said exactly the same thing . " Now it 's time for all of us to ask Nick Smarm and Reverend Bumphead some interesting questions , " said Mrs. Pigeon . " Mr. Smarm , " said a fat man , " now this is just a hypothetical question , but the way you were describing how the arms race is mostly the fault of the United States , could n't I , if I were a red-baiter type , say  --  just hypothetically now  --  that you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Please do n't anybody take my question literally ! " They took his question literally . The fat man was smothered in literalism . Squeals of indignation wafted toward the banks of the Don . " What a terrible thing to say ! " shrieked one of the progressive ladies . I 'll bet she was annoyed  --  all those friends of hers acting like Soviet agents for years , and no one ever offered to pay them . I was about to put in a word for Pudgy , but it was too late . He was already over apologizing to Nick . " What is the cost of housing in the Soviet Union as a percentage of worker wages ? " asked someone . Reverend Bumphead did n't know the answer to that , so it was Mrs. Pigeon who answered the rest of the questions . Very early Friday morning , July 23 I tried to explain my patriotic seizure to Nikolai . " Would n't you feel the same ? " But I did n't seem to be getting through . I gave up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to me , " I did not think Nick 's speech was so interesting . " He pulled a deadpan face . " I can read Pravda . " 63 Friday , July 23 Ashore in Volgograd . we were taken to Mamaev Hill , where umpteen million people died defending the place when it was still named after Stalin . A progressive chaffed me for wearing a suit and tie again . I mean , we were going to visit a mass grave . So I skipped the ceremony and went to look at a fifty-two-meter-high statue of " Mother Russia " on the hilltop , which is pretty interesting if you 've never seen a reinforced-concrete nipple four feet across . It was n't until that afternoon , after four days on the boat , that I discovered that some ordinary tourists had stumbled into this morass of the painfully caring and hopelessly committed . I came back from Mamaev Hill and I saw a normal-looking , unagitated person stretched out on the sundeck in a T-shirt from Air America , the old CIA-run Southeast Asia airline . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , traveling together on a private tour . Until now they 'd had a wonderful time in the U.S.S.R. They said it was a fine place as long as you could drink like a Russian and leave like an American . But they 'd taken this cruise without any idea of the peace that lay in store for them , and since they 'd come on board they 'd barricaded themselves in the promenade deck lounge and had kept the progressives out with loud western accents and the peaceniks away by smoking cigarettes . Smoking seems to alarm peace activists much more than voting for Reagan . Soviet-American Relations in Action T HAT EVENING at dinner time , seven or eight young Russians from the local Soviet-American friendship club were ushered on board by Mrs. Pigeon . I noticed they gobbled the meat . Their president was a stiff young fellow , a future first secretary of the Committee for Lies About Grain Production if ever there was one . He had a guitar about two times bigger than normal and a watchful mien . But the others were okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked to be twelve , and Boris , an engineer ( practically everyone in Russia is an engineer , just like our sanitation engineers are ) . Alexei wanted to talk about rock ' n ' roll . His English was no worse than the average Rolling Stone reviewer 's . " Abba  --  too nothing . Hard rock ! Yay ! ? Led Zeppelin ! Yay ! And Kiss ! ! I most like  --  hard , hard rock ! You know of Time Machine ? " He was very excited that an American recognized the name of the top Russian rock group . " Good like Beatles . But is best hard rock America , yay ! Is only too bad always rock stars so many dying of too much liquor and . . . " He shot a glance at the president . " .. . and of other things .

There was one passenger I had not noticed before , though she had a remarkable face ... the product of years of ill temper , pique , and petty malice . The president said , " We are thankfully welcomed of being here . English ours is not so well . But is practicing now you with more . " Then each of the Russian kids introduced himself and said his profession as best he could . The woman took aim at Alexei and said with great acerbity , " How many women construction workers are there in the Soviet Union ? " Alexei tried to answer , ' In construction worker training is mostly male , men I am meaning , but is also some girls if . . . " He got no further . " Girls ? ! " shrieked the old bitch . " Girls ? ! We do n't call women girls ! That 's an insult ! " The Russian kids stared at her , mystified . The hag turned on Marya . " You explain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . " Marya said something placating in Russian . The president tried a halting apology , but the woman interrupted . " One thing I 'd like to know , " she glared at Alexei 's denim trousers . " Why do young people all over Europe , even in the socialist countries , pick up that awful American popular music and those sloppy bluejeans ? " Marya made what sounded like a pained verbatim translation . All the Russian faces in the room froze into the great Russian public face  --  serious but expressionless , part poker face and part the face the troops made on " You 'll Never Get Rich " when Phil Silvers asked for volunteers . It is n't easy to get a sober Russian to do anything on impulse , but I took Marya by the cuff and convinced her we 'd better get some beer from the bar . The room was still silent when we returned . The president would n't take a drink , but the rest of the Russians seemed glad enough to bury their faces in beer . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The other Americans were getting embarrassed .

" There is another group of Americans in the lounge who are eager to discuss Soviet-American relations with our guests , and ... " " Oh , yes ! " said Marya , and she began to point to the hallway and chatter in Russian . The New Mexicans were a little surprised to see us , but their hospitality did n't falter .

Saturday , July 24 There was another peace conference under the shade deck , and this time it was the Russians ' turn to speak . I was slightly late , due to sheer reluctance . Mrs. Pigeon was opening the session . " It is better to get these answers from Soviet experts than from our press , " she was saying as 1 walked in . I walked back out again and had a beer . Actually , I had three . When I returned , Guvov , the buffoon , had wound up his speech and was answering a question about whether Solzhenitsyn was a bad writer or a spy too . He was wearing a hilarious pair of ersatz Levi 's with TEXAS JEAN printed on a salad-plate-sized plastic patch on the ass . " Solzhenitsyn painted the Soviet Union only in dark colors , " he said . The progressives clapped vigorously . " You see , " said Guvov , " criticism leads to the problems of democracy . " Time for more beer . It seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was askew . When I returned from the bar the second time , one of them was addressing Guvov . " A lot of the Americans on this trip have admitted the errors of American foreign policy . How come none of the Soviets have admitted any Soviet errors ? " " We do n't criticize the foreign policy of our government , " said Guvov , " because we hundred-percent agree with it and approve of it . " The questioner gaped . But the progressives all clapped , and so did quite a few of the peaceniks . I apologize , but this reporter did not attend any more peace functions of any kind . Loathe Boat T HE OLD LEFTIES and the peaceniks spent most of every day talking . They were not arguing . They were not analyzing . They were not making observations . What they were doing was agreeing with each other  --  in feverish spasms of accordance , mad confabs of apposi tion , blathers of consonance . On Reagan , on the weapons freeze , on the badness of Israel , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all of this they agreed . I watched my cabinmate write a letter to his wife . It was a political exhortation . " We Americans must repudiate the Reagan administration . . " This to his wife of thirty years . One , who was from the deep Midwest and looked like Millicent Fenwick , told me , " You know , if the people who put Reagan in office prevail , they 're going to take the vote from women . " As we were going through the locks of the Don-Volga canal the woman with the direct connection between her cerebral cortex and her mouth came nattering up beside me at the rail . " Is n't it marvelous ? " she said , staring at a gigantic black wall of concrete . " They 're such wonderful engineers in the Soviet Union . " I agreed it was an impressive piece of work . " Marvelous , marvelous , marvelous , marvelous , " she said . She peeked over the side . " And where do they get all the water ? " The lntourist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were getting testy , and the crew was clearly disgusted and getting into the grog ration earlier each day . The ship 's doctor , a blowsy , mottle-eyed , disbarred-looking fellow , had taken to experimenting on the diarrhea symptoms half the Americans were suffering . Marya gave an elaborate burlesque of accompanying him as the translator on his rounds , The Russians would not explain the joke , but I know one peacenik had gone to him with the malady and received a laxative and a glass of 200-proof neutral grain spirits . I did not see that person again for thirty-six hours . The Russians , when they 'd had a few drinks , would repeatedly make declarations starting , " I am not an anti-Semite , but ... " And , at least to judge by last names , many of our tour members were Jewish . One of the crew , in the most confidence-imparting stage of drunkenness , told me , " You know Brezhnev is married to a Jew . Many members of the Presidium are married to Jews . This is why we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the peaceniks and the leftists were blind to 0 this , or passed it off as anti-Zionism only . Their only serious concern was with the CIA . They were convinced there must be a CIA agent aboard . I suggested the fat man , surely an agent provocateur . But they 'd decided he was okay since he 'd apologized to Nick . Someone said the leftists suspected me  --  that coat and tie . I asked Nikolai who he thought it was . " All of them , " he laughed . Sunday , July 25 ? Sunday I was drunk . Monday , July 26 I think the Russians had decided both privately and officially that these Volga peace cruisers were inconsequential people , unable to influence American policy in any important way . When we docked in Togliatti , the leftists were very eager to see the Lada automobile plant there , one of the most modern factories in the Soviet Union . They were swooning to meet genuine " workers . " But it was n't on the schedule . Our Intourist guides made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tour , but it was too big a group , too many officials would have to be contacted , it would take too long to arrange , and so on . The leftists were pretty sore , and went so far as not to make excuses for the Soviet system this time . But meanwhile Nikolai had somehow got in touch with the Lada plant management and informed them that I worked for Car and Driver magazine . I 'm only a contributing editor there , and even if I were editor in chief I would n't have much sway over the FTC , DoT , and Reagan administration executive orders that keep the Russians from exporting cars to us . But I was a representative of the real world nonetheless . And that afternoon there was a big chauffeured car waiting at dockside to take me , the only admitted Republican on board , for a personal tour of ' the Lada plant . All the Rest of the Days on the Trip B Y TUESDAY the twenty-seventh I 'd come to the end of the tour , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days left to the cruise and six days left in Russia , but I was gone . The place just wears you out after a while . There is not a square angle or a plumb line in all the country . Every bit of concrete is crumbling from too much aggregate in the mix , and everything is made of concrete . I saw buildings with the facades falling off that were still under construction . And everything that 's well built turns out to be built by somebody else . Moscow Airport was built by West Germans , the Grand Hyatt knockoff by the French , the Lada plant by Italians , the very boat was made in Austria . The air pollution in the cities is grotesque . No machine seems to run well . And the whole of commerce visible on the Volga consisted of carting sand and phone poles from one port to the next . The New Mexicans had a contest for a bottle of champagne to be won by the first person who saw a crane with an operator in it . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserted . I asked Orlonsky where the workers were , but he turned sly on me . " Perhaps they are at lunch . " It was ten-thirty in the morning . We put in at Ulyanovsk , birthplace of Lenin . Not an easy city to find your way around in . Take Lenin Avenue to Lenin Street , go straight to Lenin Square , then left along Lenin Boulevard to Lenin Place and Lenin Lane . Do n't miss the monument to Lenin 's sister 's dog . And no reason to find your way around , nothing there , anyway . The regular tourists and I were shit-faced drunk in the bar by noon . So we drank and told jokes : old jokes , bad jokes , dirty jokes . The progressives could not get the Russians to stop us . Instead , they came back from the fantail and began to sing too , loud Russian songs with stamping and pounding of glasses . Then some of the peaceniks came up and then a few more , and they began to sing along . They sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America " and every verse of " The Star-Spangled Banner , " a most cacophonous sound . We danced and the ship 's band tried to play jitterbug . The Russians gave toasts , and we gave toasts . And someone said , " From one bunch of sons of a bitches to another . " We drank everything that came to hand , the doctor 's neutral grain spirits included , and sang and danced and drank some more until we passed out on top of the tables in a triumph of peace and Soviet-American relations . There 's nothing at all to the rest of the trip except a huge gray-and-green hangover with a glimpse of the White Kremlin making my head ache in Kazan and the band piping us ashore in the morning with , most appropriately to my mind , " The Battle Hymn of the Republic . " Then a flight to Moscow , rough weather all the way , and back to that Grand Hyatt hotel . There was a Russian disco band in the lounge , balalaika music played on electric guitars and set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to Leningrad , and I was left sitting alone in the bar waiting for my plane home a day and a half hence . An English tourist sat down next to me . " Been here long , have you ? " he said . " Been all around the country ? " " I 've been to the back of the moon ! " I said . " Scotch , " I said to the bartender . He gave me vodka . ?
