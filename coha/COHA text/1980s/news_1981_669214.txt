After touring with " Oklahoma " for eight months and playing on Broadway , Christine ' s enthusiasm for the show has not dampened a bit : // " There ' s a wonderful spirit in the company , " she says . " ' Oklahoma ' does that to you . It has a kind of contagious energy . It ' s about the simple needs of people  --  a beautiful morning can make a whole day for you , and the joy you feel is a very important and real thing. " // She defends the show vigorously , maintaining that the simple values expressed in " Oklahoma " are still valid today : // " There are people who say it ' s a stupid story  --  it isn ' t ! " she insists . And referring to the box social scene in the play : " When you were 16 , who you went with to the prom was everything to you  --  it was everything ! " she says with intensity . " So ' Oklahoma ' does have its place " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she view Laurey ? // " She ' s a brat ! I had a long time trying to ' find ' her . Most ingenues are played as being sweet and lovely . But they ' re not . They all have funny little quirks . Laurey is used to having her own way , she ' s very willful , and for a long time I played all those negative things , and hit them very hard . Then I finally said , ' But what do you love about her ? ' It was her enormous spirit  --  the pioneer spirit . She has a real desire to have a wonderful life , and a desire for beauty . So I found things to ' gentle out ' that willfulness. " // Christine Andreas has that same thoughtful , questioning way of looking at everything in her life . It ' s a quality that has stood her in good stead from her beginnings in the theater through her success in " My Fair Lady , " and now in the popular revival of " Oklahoma . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shining new stars of musical theater . She becomes pensive at the idea of success : // " I ' ve fought success for a long time . **28;6873; Why ? <> Well , I think because I love privacy , and I was working many things out for myself . I don ' t just grow theatrically and put all my energy into my business . I ' m also always trying to grow personally . I can ' t just forget about my life at home and make it over to the theater and come home to a **28;6903; mess , <> " she says , digging into the word. // " So , my growth has been slow , because I ' ve tried to keep it in a total kind of perspective . I just couldn ' t go open-armed embracing stardom , " she laughs . " That sounds **28;6933; rerrible ! <> I mean I couldn ' t embrace the whole  --  how do I want to put it  --  the whole **28;6963; package <> of success. " // The way things are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package of success has chosen to embrace her , rather than the other way around . The development of Christine Andreas ' s career is a study in logic and intuition , and an amazingly orderly unfolding of events . Although she wasn ' t born into a performing family , she describes her mother as a fine singer . . . . // " She has a melodious voice , and a good sense of rhythm  --  she should have been a big band singer . I ' m sure she changed my diapers humming ! I think I just ingested all of that  --  I was born singing , I really was . It was my way of expressing myself  --  I didn ' t think about it. " // Growing up , Christine encountered several teachers who helped out along the way : " I just seemed to run into people who kept feeding my love of singing . " Then , when she was 13 and performing in a show , she was spotted by a director who promised to introduce her to some people who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she seemed to move from one adventure to the next. // ' Getting the jobs was not as difficult for me as it has been for lots of people . I had the contacts. " // Christine considers " My Fair Lady " to be her first big break , and that , too , came about in a logical way. // " I was geared for that , too , because right before ' My Fair Lady ' I had stood by for a show called ' Words and Music . ' The director ' s name was Jerry Adler , who became the director of Fair Lady , a year or two later . And once a director knows you by working with you on one job he ' ll be more inclined to hire you for another . After ' Words and Music , ' I played a Cockney maid in ' Angel Street . ' I knew the director and I had done a Cockney , and so the next natural step was Eliza in ' Fair Lady. ' " // After Oklahoma , Christine plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just herself , her accompanists , and the audience . And this time it ' ll really be Christine playing Christine , not Eliza or Laurey or anyone else. // " In theater you ' re an instrument in many many things , you know ? " she says . " And there ' s a director , there ' s lighting , orchestration , and all these variables . With a club act it ' s your own conception . It ' s how you really want to express yourself , totally . I want to get into the wonderful Noel Coward pieces and Cole Porter and some of the very elegant stuff , as well as some jazz and blues . I know I have a performing persona of my own , and I want to find out what this persona is. " // For one who seems to have her life set out in such a methodical fashion , Christine is quick to emphasize her dependence on intuition : // " I try intuitively to do the right thing . I have people in my life who correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I love and trust . That ' s the most I can ask for at this point . And then I ' ll just allow what has to come in , come in . The intuitive will work if your heart ' s in the right place. // " But I do have a desire to be very orderly , because I like to move fast . My need for balance is enormous ! i mean when I first heard Mozart there was no doubt in my mind. i went ' Oooohhhhhhh ' . . . there was just such a balance ! I had no idea what he was doing but . . . it ' s in my nature. " // On the Boston part of the tour , Christine  --  unlike many actors and actresses who stay in hotels , living the itinerant " road " life  --  rented an apartment and some furniture , and was talking about buying some plants to make the place seem more homey. // " I ' m getting my little space livable for the month that I ' ll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ll see what ' s here . I ' ll catch the rhythm of the city. " // Christine Andreas has made up her mind about one thing and doesn ' t mind letting everyone know : // " I think it ' s OK to have a good time in your life . I ' ve decided that ! It ' s all right , as long as you do it with quality and taste. " // //
