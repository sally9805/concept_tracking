About the timetable , at least , there were few arguments : at 8 a.m. last Tuesday , a line of jeeps and canvas-covered military trucks roared up Avenue A in Panama City and disgorged armed troops at the headquarters of the Panama Defense Forces . The soldiers joined 200 others stationed there , and gunfire soon erupted inside and outside the building . Within 90 minutes , the rebels had seized the Comandancia , as it is known locally , and trapped Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega in a small part of the compound . At 11:30 , the insurgents issued a statement on national radio proclaiming their coup a success . <P> But the sounds of battle soon erupted again , this time mortar and grenade explosions and gunfire from forces loyal to Noriega . The firefight claimed the lives of ten rebels and wounded 18 loyalist troops and five civilians . By 2 that afternoon , Noriega 's supporters were rounding up the last of the rebels . It was all over but the pompous pronouncements in Panama  --  and the recriminations in Washington . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has encouraged the Panamanian military to overthrow its corrupt commander and turn him over to American authorities to stand trial on drug charges . Last week , after a group of rebellious officers actually had Noriega under their guns , debate raged in Washington about whether the characteristically cautious Bush Administration could have  --  and should have  --  done more to help the coup 's leaders . Senators , senior officials and military officers alike wondered : Had the U.S. fumbled its best opportunity to seize Noriega ? Or had it sidestepped a diplomatically dangerous and probably ineffective intervention ? <P> Bush and his deputies replied , with considerable justification , that it would have been irresponsible to implicate the U.S. fully in a fuzzy coup scheme that would have riled much of Latin America . Still , their tangled and tentative reaction to the uprising raised disturbing questions about the Administration 's ability to respond to a crisis . In the three days leading up to and during the coup , the U.S. was hobbled by a breakdown of communications , a distressing lack of reliable intelligence and an obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Noriega finally be answered . <P> At the least , the Administration was caught in embarrassing contradictions about its role . Two hours after the coup collapsed , Noriega offered his version of events . " This is part of the continuing aggression and penetration of the P.D.F . by the U.S. , " he charged on national television . As evidence , the general 's supporters pointed to U.S. Army helicopters that passed close to the Comandancia during the fighting and the hundreds of troops who were deployed , within areas under U.S. jurisdiction , in positions blocking two of the roads leading into the city . That forced Noriega 's allies to use alternate routes to transport loyal units from the elite Battalion 2000 to the fighting . <P> At first , the U.S. retorted that its limited maneuvers were intended only to safeguard American lives and property , as permitted under the Panama Canal treaties . " There were rumors around that this was some sort of an American operation , " President Bush said on Tuesday . " I can tell you that is not true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had acted at the request of the rebels .
