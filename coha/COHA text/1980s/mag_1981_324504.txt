When Brenda Sanchez of Fremont , Calif. , came home from a local grocery store last summer , her son noticed a package of Soft ' n ' Pretty toilet tissue with a ticket for a promotional game called Scott Cash . As he scraped away the silver coating over a tic-tac-toe grid , he discovered that he had won $1,000 . The elated Sanchez family promptly sent the ticket , as stipulated , to Scott Paper Co. in Chester , Pa. , by registered mail . After a month went by without a word from Scott , Martin Sanchez called the firm only to be told that someone had signed for the ticket , but no one could find it . Sanchez sent them a photocopy . Two weeks later , Scott pronounced his entry invalid , claiming it had been improperly altered . <P> A tissue of lies , said Sanchez . He hired a lawyer and headed for small claims court . In January he won his case , but Scott turned hard ' n ' ugly : it appealed . With a court date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanky and promised to send Sanchez a check for the $1,000 and $500 to cover expenses . Moral : do n't squeeze the Sanchezes.
