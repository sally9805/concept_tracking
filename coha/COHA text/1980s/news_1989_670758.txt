Such an exercise in jet-lag diplomacy inevitably exacts a physical and psychological toll , even on the fittest and most vigorous people , and it is much worse when they have to keep looking back over their shoulders at the problems pursuing them. // " It feels more like a campaign trip , improvised as we go along , than a serious foreign-policy enterprise , " a staff member said in Beijing . <> <> ' Doing ' the World Thing // Mr. Bush and his aides clearly think it worthwhile , at least at this early stage of his Presidency , to race from country to country at breakneck speed , showing the flag and spreading reassurance . Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d " did " 15 countries of Western Europe in only a few days , and now Mr. Bush has " done " Northeast Asia ( and met with the leaders of a dozen other countries ) in less than a week. // For what ? Before Mr. Bush left Washington , his national security adviser , Brent Scowcroft , said the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet . If he made them , he made them in secret , because there was not even the smallest surprise in anything that Mr. Bush or any aide reporting on his activities had to say. // Perhaps because Presidents Ford , Carter and Reagan traveled at a more measured pace , with Mr. Reagan often heading for foreign engagements several days early to give his body time to adjust , President Bush ' s schedule seemed frantic . Among old-timers in the traveling party , the helter-skelter quality of the trip recalled the Presidencies of Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon , when Air Force One was a shiny new toy in which to stage dramatic dashes around the world . <> <> Bush Frisky , Aides Fatigued // After several 20-hour days , fighting a 14-hour time difference with Washington , the President reported himself as frisky as a colt , but his associates made no effort to hide their fatigue. // John H. Sununu , the chief of staff , told his friends one morning that if he looked " rough , " it was because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nomination of former Senator John G. Tower of Texas , Mr. Bush ' s choice as Secretary of Defense. // Many corporations forbid executives from making decisions right after flying to the Far East because of the judgment-sapping effects of the travel . Military studies show how harmful sleeplessness can be to efficiency. // There is no proof , of course , that Mr. Bush or members of the White House staff made questionable decisions because they were moving too fast and resting too little . But the signs of raggedness were there for all to see . <> <> Tower Left in the Lurch // Why , for example , when it discovered on arrival in Tokyo on Thursday night that Mr. Tower was in deeper trouble than previously apparent , did the White House staff not ask the Senate Armed Services Committee to postpone its vote until the President returned to Washington ? A vote , it could have been ( but wasn ' t ) argued , should not be taken while Mr. Bush was attending the funeral of Emperor Hirohito and holding talks with the Chinese . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow for better lobbying. // Why , to cite another episode , did the White House not more carefully plan the handling of the dinner invitation to Fang Lizhi , the rights campaigner whom the Chinese police prevented from reaching the Great Wall Sheraton Hotel , where the dinner was held ? // Did it occur to anyone that the Chinese , with their hatred of " foreign devils " meddling in their affairs , might interfere ? If it didn ' t , why not ? If it did , why wasn ' t someone sent to accompany Mr. Fang to the hotel ? // Why , once again , did Mr. Bush fail to forcefully raise , after pledging to do so , the question of human rights in his lengthy meetings with the four key members of the Chinese leadership ? // An oversight ? Inadequate organization ? Or does he really think , as his spokesman , Marlin Fitzwater , explained 24 hours after the fact , that human rights is better discussed in private , without publicity ? That view , if the President indeed holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conservatives he has so avidly cultivated . Window of Vulnerability ? What is worse , Mr. Bush opened himself to criticism from countries that the United States has regularly taxed with rights violations , countries like Poland , the Soviet Union , South Africa and Israel , and from their backers , who can now ask why China gets an exemption. // There were many signs of haste and inexperience in the way the trip was organized : an attempt to squeeze a mini-news conference into an already jammed schedule just before leaving Tokyo , only a few hours after another such event at which Mr. Bush said exactly the same things ; completely inadequate provisions for feeding reporters and staff members in Seoul. // Mr. Bush has reveled in favorable comparisons to his predecessor , for his appointments of experienced government hands rather than ideologues to vital jobs , for his openness with reporters and the public , and for his promises to better the lot of the poor . Now he faces adverse comparisons . The Reagan staff , it will surely be said , would not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Yet the trip had its benefits . Even if little of substance was discussed , the Japanese were grateful for Mr. Bush ' s presence at the Emperor ' s rites , and even if things went awry , the Chinese obviously relished the President ' s effort to define a " special relationship " between Washington and Beijing , and they obviously like the Bushes. // There could have been no more substantial evidence of American readiness for change than what happened in the last 36 hours of the trip . There was George Bush telling the South Koreans that the United States , which fought with them against North Korea , welcomed Seoul ' s attempts to reach a modus vivendi with the old enemy. // And there was George Bush , who was part of the attempt to worry Moscow by cozying up to Beijing , telling the Chinese that their talks with the Russians were fine .
