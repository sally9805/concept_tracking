' ' Before the revolution , I chopped wood , I worked on a cotton plantation , I went from estate to estate . But it was always the same bad deal , long hours and low wages , no medical care , no schools , forced extra hours without extra pay , and if we complained we were arrested. ' ' // Today , Mr. Mendez ' s life has changed . His family is one of an estimated 25 , 000 peasant families ( out of 130 , 000 ) who have received some 612 , 000 acres of land in Nicaragua since the 1979 Sandinista revolution. // Even many critics of the Sandinista National Liberation Front ( FSLN ) , the official state party , contend that the reform is one of the most positive aspects of the Sandinista revolution , and perhaps the most creative agrarian reform in Latin America. // Under the leadership of FSLN ' s directorate member and agriculture minister , Jaime Wheelock Roman , the reform has been creative in organizing the peasants who have received land into a flexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has stressed the importance of maintaining production incentives and a degree of private ownership. // Also , as Western diplomatic observers point out , the law governing appropriations which has been in force since 1981 is basically a moderate one based on how large landowners use their land rather than on inflexible limits of land ownership. // Land reform here has been pushed in a moderate direction not only because of Jaime Wheelock ' s ideology , but also because of Nicaraguan history and society. // First , during the 30-odd years of its rule , the Somoza family and its principal allies accumulated vast amounts of land , much of which was turned into large coffee and cotton plantations employing many hired peasants . Thus , when the Sandinistas came to power , merely by nationalizing the properties of Somoza and his followers , they acquired some 20 percent of the country ' s cultivated land. // Second , Nicaragua possesses a favorable ratio of land to population . Therefore it is possible to obtain new lands by expanding the area under cultivation rather than moving to nationalize more property. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small and medium-size peasant landowners . There were some 87 , 000 such families in the early ' 70s , says Arturo Cruz Porras , Jr. , a former Sandinista official studying Nicarguan land reform. // Today , 60 percent of the land is still in private hands - with 15 percent belonging to large landowners and 45 percent to small and medium-sized landholders . Twenty-five percent of the land belongs directly to the state , much of this former Somozista property , still operating as large plantations hiring day laborers , according to the Ministry of Agriculture. // The Sandinistas say co-ops will be the wave of the future , with as much as 50 percent of the land belonging to co-ops and the rest equally divided between the government and the private sector. // Already 67 , 000 families are part of the co-op system . Co-ops are expected to grow at the expense of the private sector . But the Ministry of Agriculture expects this growth to result from the voluntary organization of peasants into co-ops , not further large-scale nationalization of land from larger private owners. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communal co-ops like the Soviet system or Israeli kibbutzes . Land is owned in common , but there is more private incentive than in the Israeli kibbutz. // All co-op members are paid money wages . And profits not reinvested in the farm or used to pay for social services are split up as among co-op members . Those who work more hours get more profits. // These communal co-ops are 28 percent of the land worked by the entire co-op system . All peasants on them are there voluntarily . Alberto Mendez now works on one , and most who have chosen the communes tend to have been those who previously had no land. // 2 . Credit and service co-ops ( CCS ) . Here the land is all privately owned and worked . Marketing is individual , but credit and services are collectively obtained . Some CCSs have a plot of common land which is collectively cultivated . CCSs control 8 percent of the land in the co-op system. // 3 . Service and production co-ops . Most Sandinistas hail these as combining the best elements of capitalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned but adjacent to each other . Co-op members decide to cultivate only one single crop , thus permitting collectively owned tractors to plow rows of the adjacent plots . All services , credits , and marketing are in common . Profits are individual , except for some set aside to buy the tractor , get credits , or such activities. // This third type is being pushed by the Ministry of Agriculture as the wave of the future , representative of the ' ' third way ' ' ( neither capitalism nor communism ) which Sandinismo represents . Western diplomats believe that both Mr. Wheelock and the officials working under him in the ministry represent the more moderate , ' ' third way ' ' wing of the FSLN . Observers believe that the land-reform program has shown imagination and flexibility in its mix of systems and desire to set up organizations adaptable to different needs. // Observers state a main accomplishment of the land-reform policies has been the large supply of financial credits to peasants . They say that banking policies under Somoza either cut peasants off from capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken over by large estate owners. // Finally , Western diplomats describe the terms of land expropriation as even more flexible than those of El Salvador . Originally , the government only nationalized land belonging to Somozistas . Then in 1981 , the Agriculture Ministry established a law permitting nationalization of estates larger than 850 acres with largely unutilized land , or estates being substantially decapitalized. // Critics of the program stress early mistakes stemming from radical dogmatism . Though it was always clear that the Sandinistas needed to nationalize more than just Somozista lands to carry out their program , they initially pretended that only such land would be nationalized. // Until 1981 , the law permitting nationalization of Somozista land was also stretched to include lands whose owners had no real Somoza connection . Although this has largely ceased , it created great fear among private owners that all lands would eventualy be nationalized. // According to Arturo Cruz Jr . , Wheelock ' s original policy tended to stress the establishment of state communes and the turning of Nicaraguan peasants into communal laborers . However , observers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifted the reform ' s orientation . Finally , Cruz notes that from 1979 to 1982 , the FSLN maintained a policy of extremely low prices on basic grains . This helped the urban proletarian but hurt small peasant landowners forced to sell their products 30 percent under cost . The subsequent drop in production of grains has forced the Sandinistas to change their policy and pay the peasants higher prices. // //
