There is n't much else in the pot , and trouble is brewing <P> The party congress had come and gone , government officials had promised new approaches to old programs , but still the anger grew . In Warsaw , some 2,000 textile workers quit their jobs for three hours , and many municipal bus drivers refused to go out on their routes . In Lodz , the country 's second largest city , caravans of trucks and buses drove into the center of town with headlights flashing and horns blaring to the cheers of thousands of approving onlookers . The vehicles were festooned with red and white national flags and banners bearing such blunt messages as HUNGER and WE STAND IN LINE UNTIL OUR HEARTS BREAK . Next day as many as 10,000 women and children took to the streets of Lodz in protest . <P> The latest unrest was sparked by the government 's abrupt announcement two weeks ago that food prices would soon triple or even quadruple- and the simultaneous word that meat rations would be cut by 20% , allotting each person only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12.5 lbs . ) . That decree was one too many for the Poles , who must line up as long as 14 hours for basic foodstuffs . Moreover , between 30% and 50% of those standing in the queues go away empty-handed because of shortages of virtually everything . Even in the relatively well-supplied city of Cracow , window displays in grocery stores consist almost entirely of pyramids of packages of tea . <P> With the deepening food crisis , the public mood has shifted from resignation to anger . " Waiting in line is a national sickness , " complained a Gdansk woman , who takes turns in the queues with her husband and two teen-age children . Snapped an unmarried Lodz textile worker : " We have been making sacrifices for years , but nothing has changed for the better . They need to improve our working conditions and give us some more food before they start talking of sacrifices . " <P> As dissension spread last week , a hasty compromise was hammered out between the government and Solidarity , the trade union . But the agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month and make up the shortfall in the future , sidestepped the fact that restrictions are unavoidable in Poland . <P> <P> At week 's end the government 's problems produced a Cabinet shuffle that unseated three ministers . Among them was Deputy Premier Mieczyslaw Jagielski , who was reportedly sacked for failing to produce an economic recovery program . Premier Wojciech Jaruzelski , an army general , turned to two fellow officers to fill vacant posts : General Czeslaw Kiszczak as Interior Minister , and General Tadeusz Hupalowski as Minister of Administration . <P> Solidarity blames the food shortages largely on the government 's grossly inefficient distribution system . There is some support for that argument . Grain-bearing ships , for example , are often unable to unload at Polish ports because there is no room in the grain elevators . Reason : a lack of trains to transport the grain to Poland 's hungry people .
