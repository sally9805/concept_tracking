No more shouting <P> " When a man becomes a foreman , he has to forget about even being human , as far as feelings are concerned . " <P> -A factory hand quoted in Studs Terkel 's Working <P> In their drive to improve productivity , a growing number of U.S. companies have begun to appreciate the crucial importance of shop-floor supervisors . For better or worse , that hard-pressed first level of bosses often sets the working tone for an entire plant . The style has traditionally been management by shouting : bark out orders like a Marine drill instructor until they get results . <P> Some companies , though , are beginning to challenge that old approach because it no longer works , especially with younger workers . One of the hottest new fields of management training involves teaching shop-floor bosses how to be better supervisors . <P> Zenger-Miller , a Menlo Park , Calif. , consulting firm , has sold shop-floor training programs to 250 companies since 1977 , including such firms as American Can Co. , Honeywell and FMC Corp . Its 15-week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between bosses and workers . <P> Fairchild Republic Co. , division of Fairchild Industries ( 1981 revenues : $1.4 billion ) , is an enthusiastic new user of shop-floor training . Morale in its Farmingdale , N.Y. , plant that builds U.S. Air Force jets collapsed early this year when the company laid off almost 1,000 workers-about 15% of its labor force . Absenteeism averaged 5.3% of scheduled working time . Disputes sometimes led to shouting matches on the plant floor that were settled by fistfights in the parking lot . Some Fairchild Republic officials believed that the supervisors were a key to the company 's problems . Workers were being made shop-floor bosses with little or no preparation , and some tended to bully those below them . <P> Fairchild Republic is now sending 93 supervisors from the plant through the Zenger-Miller course , which meets for one three-hour session every other week . Participants memorize guidelines like " Calmly describe the employee 's behavior which concerns you , " and " Express supportend , reassurance . " <P> The company is already benefiting from the program , which began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improving , despite continued layoffs . The training sessions have contributed to the completion of more jobs on schedule , and the company this spring won an Air Force productivity award for its work on the A-10 Thunderbolt II jet fighter . <P> Fairchild Republic had tried several management programs before , but had been unhappy with all of them . The new method of role playing and teaching by example seems to produce the best results . Says Linda Dwyer , supervisor of training and development : " The other programs were too abstract . They were entertaining , like the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders , but they did n't get the ball downfield. "
