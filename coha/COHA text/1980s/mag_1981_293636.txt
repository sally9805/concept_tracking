SOUTHERN COMFORT Directed by Walter Hill Screenplay by Michael Kane Walter Hill and David Giler Hip deep in a Louisiana swamp , the squad of National Guardsmen gets befuddled . According to the map , there should n't be a lake around here . But there is , and unless they steal some boats to cross it , they will not reach their objective in time . This they do , which riles the crafts ' Cajun owners , whose tempers are not improved when the weekend soldiers fire blanks at them . Indeed , that is all it takes to turn a war game into a deadly game . The locals are cruel , cunning and know their soggy country . The Guardsmen-except for two , a city sharpster ( Keith Carradine ) and a tough transfer from Texas ( Powers Boothe ) - are inept , panicky and , in at least one case , mentally unstable . The odds on surviving the murderously vengeful swamp rats are obviously short-so obvious and so short , in fact , that the film eventually becomes more of an exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patrol genre somewhat uneasily meet Deliverance . The film is handsome , has a few good patches of gritty , laconic dialogue and is well crafted by Director Hill , who has proved in such previous straight-line adventures as The Warriors and The Long Riders that he is probably the best stager of action now in practice . It would be nice if , some day , he put some characters on screen who were individuals instead of types and made a film one could care about emotionally instead of technically . - R.S.
