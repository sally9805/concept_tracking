But things change . Cleated Cinderellas , unknown until their last season , will be part of the dramatics tomorrow . And one-time , can ' t-miss heroes who have slipped must now wait to see whether there still is interest in them. // The up-and-coming among the draft crop include the disparate situations of Schad , who plays offensive line for Queens University of Kingston , Ontario ; Tom Newberry , the short , blocky offensive lineman from small-time Wisconsin-La Crosse , and Mike Norseth of Kansas , who played quarterback only two seasons at a four-year college. // Then there are those who seemed ready to step onto any pro team in the N.F.L. - or United States Football League - only to fall into disfavor : Byars , injured for much of his senior year ; Robbie Bosco , the throwing quarterback from Brigham Young ; Kenneth Davis , the Texas Christian runner who was forced to quit the team after revelations that he took money from alumni. // Speaking of Schad , the Jets ' personnel director , Mike Hickey , said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world who will claim they knew about this guy before the East-West game . But I ' d like to see them on a polygraph. " // In all of Canada , only about 30 colleges play football. // " The N.F.L. is the be-all and end-all of football , " says Schad . But he also knew that he had to impress American college scouts. // " What helped me was getting to the Shrine Game , " he said . " I ' m the fastest lineman in Canada. " // He is also 6 feet 5 inches tall , weighs 295 pounds , and when they tested him at the N.F.L. scouting combine he ran the 40-yard dash in under 4. 7 seconds. // But many Canadians falter in these circumstances . Schad points out that the life of a Canadian college football player is very different from his United States counterpart. // " I spent three years in the Army Reserves here in Canada , and I ' m sort of accustomed to that intense atmosphere , " he explains about the N.F.L. // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " recalls Dick Steinberg , the Patriots ' director of player development . " He was big and fast . Most Canadian football is like our Division I-AA. " // Norseth was another player who had an outstanding postseason game to attract interest. // " I was fortunate enough to win the m. v.p. in the Blue-Gray Game , " he said . Norseth threw the winning pass in that game , a culmination of an upward-curve season. // " I had a lot better receivers this year , " said Norseth . At one point he had thrown 175 passes without an interception. // But his first two years were at Snow College , a junior college in Ephraim , Utah , and so he arrived at Kansas with little fanfare . National attention started when he passed for 480 yards against Vanderbilt last season. // " All of a sudden he ' s got everybody ' s attention , " said Hickey . " But to complete the puzzle , after he does well in the bowl games , he doesn ' t show up for the workout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married. " // The implication is that perhaps Norseth ' s motivation isn ' t intense enough. // " I planned to get married a long time before I knew about the workouts , " said Norseth. // When you are playing for a National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics Division II school , and you ' re only 6-1 but weigh 285 pounds , you must impress people quickly . At least , that is how Newberry from Wisconsin-La Crosse analyzed his situation. // " I knew I had to knock everybody flat on every play , " he said. // He starred in the Blue-Gray game and in the combine workouts . " He flew down the line , " Hickey recalled. // Newberry was timed in 4. 68 , the fastest time among offensive linemen and just a shade quicker than Schad. // People started hearing things about Newberry , how he was an amateur boxer in a tough-man contest , how he captured the N.C.A.A. Division III titles in the discus throw and shot-put twice . " The Jets have shown quite a bit of interest in me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half hours a day and whose body-fat content is only 10 percent. // On the other hand , there was Bosco ' s fall from grace. // " A lot of his fame might have been media stuff , " contends Steinberg . " He was in a showcase offense and did great and was courageous against Michigan . But when we went in and analyzed it , his arm wasn ' t that strong. " // After 33 touchdowns and 11 interceptions in his junior year of 1984 , Bosco slipped to 30 touchdowns and 24 interceptions. // " Bosco will be this year ' s candidate for overscouted player , such as Marino , " Hickey said . " He was overscouted . They knew so much about him they started looking for things wrong . Bosco ' s a kid who rated as a great prospect and he ' s a great leader , and just because he doesn ' t have a cannon for an arm people get down on him . Suddenly , a person with a competitive personality has a fall from grace. " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the field after the first game . But his off-the-field behavior has been. // " He missed 10 games and he was rusty in the Senior Bowl , " recalls Steinberg. // The school ' s sports information director , Glen Stone , said that " after the first of the year , the scouts stopped coming around. " // Davis averaged 7. 6 yards a carry in 1984 . Scouts wondered whether he could catch the ball , too . As if to answer , he began the 1985 campaign with a pro-style game against Tulane - 152 rushing yards on 24 carries , 5 receptions for an additional 81 yards. // " Suddenly , his bubble bursts , " said Hickey . " It alters your perception of him . What does he do ? Does he complain ? Does he accept it like a man ? He goes to the Senior Bowl and looks pretty good in practice but in the game they don ' t give him the ball . He goes to the combine physical in New Orleans and he doesn ' t show up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to him ? " // " A few weeks ago , " said Stone , " Davis showed up driving a silver Mercedes . He ' s not the first athlete to have a car like that , but the timing was strange. " // But the most nagging and frustrating questions remain about Byars. // " What we tell the scouts and general managers and coaches who call is that there ' s a very good chance he ' ll be as good as new , " said Ohio State ' s sports information director , Marv Homan . " New " was good enough to produce a total of 42 touchdowns in his sophomore and junior seasons , and to rush for 1 , 764 yards as a junior and average 5. 3 yards a carry. // This is how highly regarded he had been until he planted his right foot in practice last Labor Day , tried to cut , and broke a bone : // " I personally liked Byars better than Bo Jackson , coming into the fall , " said Hickey . " Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he breaks a bone in his foot. " // After sitting out several games , he returned too quickly and reinjured it . He had surgery in January , and the cast was not taken off until 10 days ago. // " They say that graft surgery is pretty successful , " contends Steinberg . " But he could be taken lower in the draft. " // " It ' s a tragedy , " said Homan . " We believed he was ready for a remarkable senior year. " // It was difficult to reach Byars for comment last week . He was making a tour of N.F.L. teams who were testing him . <> <> Dudek Adds Element to the Mystery // And what about the man who scored 79 touchdowns , averaged 7. 1 yards a carry , once threw a 43-yard touchdown and wound up as one of the most productive runners in collegiate history ? // That would be Joe Dudek , who played for Plymouth State in Plymouth , N.H. , a Division III school . He will not be a first-round draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balloting and garnered the sixth highest number of first-place votes. // " He had a good senior season , " says the Patriots ' player-development director , Dick Steinberg . " It was what we expected. " // Dudek , though , is only 181 pounds and 6 feet tall , and does not have the speed pro scouts believe is necessary to offset his small stature . His record should earn him a third-round pick. //
