DRAWING THE BATTLE LINES ON AIDS . by Holly G. Miller When Adm . Jim Watkins celebrated his 61st birthday on March 7 , his office staff threw a surprise party . It was n't a sit-down dinner for 50 such as Watkins used to host when he was one of the five Joint Chiefs of Staff , and it was n't prepared by the seven-member crew assigned to the Watkins household back when he was Chief of Naval Operations ( CNO ) . Instead , it was spontaneous , it was fun , and as the admiral 's first mate , Sheila Watkins , notes , " There was n't a dry eye in the house . " Why the tears ? Because the admiral , winding down a nine-month voluntary tour of duty as chairman of the president 's commission on AIDS , used the event to thank what he calls his " incredible " staff . " Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking . . . , " he began , knowing the familiar intro would draw immediate laughter . It did . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat as the commission 's spokesman in October , Watkins has undergone endless grilling by reporters , issued countless public statements , and submitted to intensive televised interviews . His media reviews have been of the " rave " variety , and he has earned applause from persons who formerly criticized the government 's handling of the AIDS epidemic . The praise has been lavish . Although the admiral is quick to credit all success to the 13-member presidential panel and the 30-person staff , they are quick to return the compliment . " He 's an absolute joy to work with , " says Polly Gault , the executive director of the commission , who previously oversaw an education sub-committee on Capitol Hill . Polly interviewed for her post in the vestibule of Garfinckel 's department store in Washington when the admiral had to exit his buildings during a fire-alarm emergency . The admiral was determined not to waste a minute in reorganizing the commission after its original chairman and vice-chairman resigned last year . Meetings were scheduled on the run in an effort to push ahead with the panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " Polly says . " They 'd say , ' You 've had it so easy , Polly . You 've worked for two of the nicest members of the U.S. Senate . Someday you 're going to be surprised at how hard the world really is and how tough some people can be . ' When I signed up to work with the commission 1 thought , Well , this could be it . It 's going to be back to boot camp . But it 's been a delight . The admiral has been wonderful to work for . I 'm batting three-for-three . " Retired Adm . William Small , once vice chief of naval operations under Admiral Watkins , recalls his former boss as " warm and open  --  a delight to work for . He set very high standards for himself , particularly in areas of morality , standards of excellence , personal demeanor , and ethical conduct . " A personal hallmark of the admiral is his ability to bypass the bureaucracy to get things done . " He never sees red tape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't see any reason for it to be , and felt if everyone did what he thought was right , the bureaucracy would have to adjust to it . That 's a great attitude for the No. 1 leader to have . He 's a religious man , a very religious fellow , but not in any dogmatic way . " In spite of his 41 years in the military and his reputation for running a tight ship , Watkins is informal and flexible , and he mixes easily with all levels of Washington 's power structure . His quick wit , friendliness , and willingness to match his staff 's ten-hour days have helped to create a **26;4827;TOOLONG office environment . Staffers look forward to his morning rounds and never construe his visits to their desks as a BigBrother-is-watching tactic . Macy Moy , an executive secretary on loan from the Department of Education , says the only obvious throwback to the admiral 's regimented navy life is his adherence to military time . She 's learned to adjust , can translate his jammed appointment calendar either way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commission that she generally is at her // desk by 0700 at the latest . " I did n't seek the hot seat , " Watkins says . " I did n't ask for this job . I was called and asked to be a commissioner to bring some military experience to the group . But I did n't expect to take over the commission 's leadership . " The unanticipated request came when Jim Watkins went out to the West Coast on business . He was attending a luncheon meeting at the Los Angeles Country Club when he was called to the phone . " It was Washington , " Mrs. Watkins recalls . " My husband was asked to take over the chairmanship . He said that he wanted time to think it over , but he really did n't have any choice . He 's always served his country , and he 's always admired President Reagan . " His reluctance was twofold . First , he had only recently retired from the navy , and he had a full agenda of activities planned . All had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned about the direction the commission had taken under its former leadership . " I had complained from day one that we had no structure , we had no objectives , we had n't laid out a plan , we had n't pulled together a staff . What were we doing ? " Watkins asks . " Why were we holding hearings ? What information did we need ? But I felt there was an opportunity to make a go of it . By December , when we had submitted our report a week early , I knew we could do it . By then we had a road map , as 1 call it , a strategy to deal with the probfirst admiral in charge of enlisted personnel and then as the chief of naval personnel , he had been deeply involved in offering support and sensitive leadership to a diverse group of recruits , many of whom were troubled . The post-Vietnam years he spent directing personnel were difficult for the country , the all-volunteer military was struggling to succeed , and the image of men and women in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene and responded with a barrage of innovative " people programs " boosting education , fitness , motivation , pride , and ethical conduct within the ranks . Personal excellence became his chief concern , and his efforts were so successful that when he retired from active duty in June 1986 , he announced his intention to devote part of his time to promoting a national program for personal excellence among youth . Operating under foundation grants and drawing from his navy experience , he lobbied business and government for a comprehensive plan that would emphasize education , health , and motivation in students . He hesitated to increase his responsibility with the AIDS commission because he knew he 'd have to put the personal excellence program on the back burner for a year . But now he sees the goals of the program to be in harmony with the objectives of the AIDS panel . He believes AIDS is a devastating symptom of a society in need of help . The disease is calling attention to the many social problems  --  drugs , teenage pregnanlem . I knew then that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact  --  on the nation . " The commission was originally established in June 1987 to advise President Reagan on how the nation should respond to the AIDS epidemic . At first , the task of studying the deadly disease seemed to be a 180-degree turn away from Watkins ' prime area of expertise , nuclear engineering . A graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy , he had had years of experience in nuclear propulsion , ineluding the command of a nuclear-powered attack submarine and combat service as executive officer aboard the world 's first nuclear-powered cruiser , the U.S.S. Long Beach . He had served as right arm to Adm . Hyman Rickover , the legendary father of the nuclear navy . But Watkins ' star-spangled military career also had taken a second bent , and that experience proved to be invaluable when he assumed the chairmanship of the Presidential AIDS Commission . As the navy 's cy , inadequate education  --  that must be addressed by the nation . The epidemic has jolted the country and has forced people to look at themselves and the shortcomings in the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AIDS tells us we have a health crisis at a time of health-education weakness , " Watkins says . " It has also caused us to talk about how we treat each other and about our compassion and sensitivity to others . I think it may well be a catalyst for positive change if we look at it as an opportunity . Frankly , while I see AIDS as a critical problem , I also see it as an important subset of a larger dilemma . We can not be complacent . I think someday as we look back , we 'll see AIDS not only as a tragedy , but as an opportunity that we took advantage of or lost . I hope it will be the former . " Just as AIDS is everyone 's responsibility , Watkins believes youth is everyone 's concern , and that the two are linked . He endorses a partnership approach to problem solving , with all people participating in building a healthy , motivated , literate society . He especially emphasizes building a pool of bright young people . " What I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . " We 've got a real problem in this country demographically and qualitatively . We 've got international competition to worry about . We do n't have enough scientists and engineers . Our technological needs are staggering . How can we have Star Wars ? Where will we get all the scientists that we need for AIDS re-search ? " The answer is in the U.S. Senate in California . Overachievement ran in the family . " We were like any other good family in that we had examples in our mother and father , " he says . " There were seven of us kids . As number six , I was beaten around the head and shoulders by the top five . I learned to struggle along . Although we were n't wealthy , we had enough money so that my parents were able to pull me out of a useless school and send me to a good one . The do-it-yourself education process was in vogue in the ' 30s , and it meant take away the tough stuff and give the kids the easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had me tutored for three months to get me ready to attend the good school . " He met his wife , Sheila , when he was stationed in San Diego and she was a senior at San Diego State College majoring in journalism . Her dad was a navy captain , so she was well aware of the topsy-turvy life in store for her when she said yes to his marriage proposal . " We fell in love , head over heels , " she says with a laugh . " I never did , as they say in the vernacular , ' do my own thing . ' I had interests , but by and large I was a homemaker . The navy takes it out of you as a family . It 's hard , very hard . I 'm a strong person , and there were times when if it had n't have been for my faith , I do n't know if I could have made it . " Somehow she kept order in the house even though the future , and the future is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's up to everyone to make sure those young people are prepared for the challenge . Again , it comes down to personal excellence , a topic he knows firsthand . If " Be All That You Can Be " is the current slogan of the United States Army , it 's been the Watkins family philosophy for generations . The admiral participated in a personal excellence program long before he packaged it and introduced it to the navy . His father was a successful Southern California Edison executive , and his mother was the first woman to run for thehouse changed 32 times in their naval career . Because the admiral was a nuclear submariner , he was at sea for long stretches , leaving her to supervise their six children . As difficult as the separations and numerous moves were , the nomadic lifestyle cemented the family together . Friends kept changing but the family was always intact . " Of course , no one is perfect , everybody 's got warts , but our children are bright and have been blessed with good health , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very high achievers . None is laid-back . In that way , they 're like their father . " in medical expenses and lost wages caused by food-borne disease each year could be put to better use . Finally , we could reduce our dependence on chemical fumigants that leave residues and may cause cancer . The reality is we will never have , and have never had , absolute guarantees about the food we eat . Food , or the lack of it , can already kill us or make us sick . All of us thus must decide if the devil we know is better than the devil we don't.
