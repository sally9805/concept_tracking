But as more and more entrepreneurs decided to get a piece of the action , television advertising in general started to level off . Now , the rising number of new independent stations and sluggish ad dollars have combined with unexpected rises in the cost of programming to dampen the outlook for many of the nation ' s 260 independents. // Nowhere is that clearer than in the financial data for several of the five stations that the Taft Broadcasting Company has recently put up for sale . At WCIX-TV in Miami , for example , profits have dropped to $4. 6 million , from $10. 4 million , in four years as advertising revenues flattened , programming costs shot up and promotion costs soared. // Taft also faces problems in Dallas and Houston because of general depression in the markets and increased competition from newer stations . <> <> ' Problems Are More Intense ' // " The problems are more intense for independent stations than for network affiliates , " said Dennis Leibowitz , an analyst at the Donaldson , Lufkin &; Jenrette Securities Corporation. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affiliates , " he noted , " because they get the bulk of their programming from the networks . And the addition of a new independent in a market that already has several is much more severe on independents than affiliates . " The high programming budgets of the networks allow them to attract at least two-thirds of the audiences , leaving the independents to divide the remainder. // Only one of the stations Taft is selling , WTAF-TV in Philadelphia , had consistent growth in operating profits . For the rest , results have been weak over the past several years . <> <> A Tough Four Years at WCIX // For example , WCIX saw its operating profit before depreciation plummet nearly $6 million from fiscal 1983 to the fiscal year that ended March 31 , while revenues - $22 million in 1983 - fell slightly in that period. // " The station had undoubtedly suffered from increased competition and increased program costs since Taft bought it , " said Howard Stark , an independent television station broker who sold Taft the Miami station in 1983 . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has better placement on the dial and a stronger signal . And it is still the leading independent in Miami in audience share , the number of homes with viewers watching television . <> <> Other New Independents in Miami // Nevertheless it is facing increased competition . Besides WCIX , two more independents have come to Miami in the past five years . WBFS-TV , a UHF station that only came on the air in November 1984 , is now getting a 7 percent share in recent Nielsen data , compared with an eight share for WCIX . The new channel , launched by Milton Grant , an entrepreneur , had a 4 percent share in its first year. // Additionally , Odyssey Partners , an investment group , has started WDZL-TV , also an independent , which is getting a 5 percent share. // As a result of increased competition , key cost factors have escalated at WCIX . Independent stations , which can not depend on the networks for their programming , have to bid heavily for outside shows , particularly reruns of old network series . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WCIX , programming costs jumped to $7. 7 million in fiscal 1986 , from $4. 4 million in fiscal 1984. // The other major price increase has been expenditures on promotion and publicity , which rose to $1. 2 million last year , from $620 , 300 in fiscal 1984 . <> <> Market Saturation Noted // " There are simply more stations than the market can support , " said one broadcast executive who asked not to be named . " The stations are still making money . The problem is that the value of the station has declined in terms of absolute numbers . It might have been worth $80 million or $90 million . Now it is worth $40 million or $50 million. " // Because of the large Hispanic audience in Miami markets , there are also several Spanish language stations , and they too have had an impact. // " Miami is a unique market because the two Spanish-language stations may not directly erode the English-language advertising pool , but they take audiences away from the English-language stations , " said Barry Lewis , a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that stations have a tough time raising advertising rates , he explained . <> <> Problems in Dallas and Houston // WCIX is not the only bad news at Taft. // The Houston station , KTXH-TV , was launched only two years ago but has had a succession of owners . Started by two entrepreneurs , it was sold to the Gulf Broadcasting Company , which in turn sold it to Taft , which has now put it up for sale . From the data available , it appears that operating income has fallen dramatically. // The income picture is also poor at KTXA-TV in Dallas , which had operating income of $3 million for the seven months ended July 31 , 1985 , but saw its income drop to $1. 6 million for the eight months ended March 31 , 1986 . Taft acquired the station in 1985 . <> <> Big Gains at Philadelphia Station // The best performer of the stations Taft is selling is WTAF-TV , in Philadelphia , where operating profits climbed to $11. 6 million in fiscal 1986 , from $5. 6 million in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $13 million , from $6. 7 million , in that period . Those added costs were more than made up by increased advertising dollars , which climbed to $40 million , from $17 million , from 1982 to 1986 . Another factor helping WTAF was that there has been only one new independent station in Philadelphia in recent years. // Early last year there were 214 independents nationwide , compared with the 260 today . In addition , there are fewer shows available for reruns these days . Unless a series lasts at least three years , there are not a sufficient numbers of episodes to sell to the independents . As a result , stations are willing to pay top dollar for network hits . <> <> The Inflation Factor // The slowdown in the inflation rate has also hurt independents , said David Londoner , an analyst with Wertheim &; Company . Through 1984 , they did particularly well because programming was bought for five-year periods at fixed costs , and inflation increased revenues and profit margins . But now , he said , " programming costs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the revenue side. " // The total value of the five Taft stations , which include an independent station in Washington , was put at $297. 5 million by one broadcasting analyst. //
