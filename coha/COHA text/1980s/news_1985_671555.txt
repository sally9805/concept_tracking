But in a Federal trial in Danville , Ill . , El Rukn , which has been described by law-enforcement officials as the nation ' s " ultimate street gang , " is suing state prison officials for recognition as a religious organization. // The group ' s attorney , Thomas Peters , argues that it is irrelevant that El Rukns might also engage in crime. // " I don ' t think it makes any difference from a legal standpoint , " he said recently . " It ' s my belief that a group can be a combination of gang members and religious believers. " // In prisons now , he said , " they can play together but they can ' t pray together , which to me doesn ' t make a lot of sense . " <> <> Suit in Behalf of Prisoners // At the time the lawsuit was filed in 1979 in behalf of about 100 members in Illinois prisons , they described themselves as " members of the Moorish Science Temple of America , El Rukn tribe . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or religious leader , is Malik , whose given name is Jeff Fort. // Mr. Fort , 38 years old , is serving a 13-year prison term in Texas for cocaine trafficking . It was after he was released on a previous sentence in 1977 that the gang Mr. Fort had led since the 1960 ' s took the name El Rukn and began describing themselves as members of the Moorish Science faith. // Among law-enforcement officials in Chicago , where the organization has headquarters on the South Side , the reaction of Richard M. Daley , the Cook County prosecutor , has been typical. // " If El Rukn is a religious group , " he said , " its sacraments are narcotics trafficking , intimidation , terror and human sacrifice. " // In response , Amir Salim Khaadim , who describes himself as " one of the learned brothers " of El Rukn , said last week in an interview : " How can one man make an assessment of the elevation and the growth of another man ? Islam is a very simple religion and it is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So you have to grow into the stages of life and this is the only thing that is taking place . " <> <> Acceptance of the Faith // Mr. Khaadim , 33 , said he accepted first the Moorish Science faith and later orthodox Islam while in prison . Members now in prison , he said , want the freedom " to have a religious service , have a prayer service. " // But Michael R. Lane , the Illinois Corrections Director , said the members really want to be able to meet together to plot more crimes and to use any official recognition to intimidate other inmates and to recruit. // " What this case is about , " Mr. Lane said recently in an interview , " is keeping the control in the hands of the prison system . We ' re not going to willingly give it up. " // Mr. Khaadim , who under his given name , Eugene Hunter , served eight years in prison for killing a man , estimated that 2 to 3 percent of the membership , which has been variously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convicted of serious crimes. // But he explained : " We never took the position that our members don ' t do anything wrong . We say that some of us are guided rightly and some of us are guided wrongly . Some of us stay on the path and some of us have a tendency to go off the path. " // " Does that , " Mr. Khaadim asked , " make me not believe in the Supreme Being ? That only says that I need more grooming and more growth . " <> <> Evolution of Chicago Gang // The evolution of El Rukns - the literal translation from Arabic is " the foundation " - from the Blackstone Rangers , which later became the Black P Stone Nation , is a story familiar to many Chicagoans. // In the late 1960 ' s and early 1970 ' s , in wars with their rivals , the Gangster Disciples , more than 200 people were killed , the police have said . Ironically at the same time , the Stones obtained at least $1 million from Federal antipoverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The Rev. John R. Fry , who was then pastor of First Presbyterian , recalled those days in a telephone interview from Oregon , where he now lives. // The Stones , he said , were a " novel " organization because they were a confederation of gangs , led by a collective leadership known as the Main 21. // " The thing that also made them novel , " he said , " was that they were actually interested in a concrete way in one of the most bitter black ghettos of Chicago , East Woodlawn . " Impressed by that , he and other church officials began to mediate gang disputes and set up job-training programs with Federal funds . Gang leaders were used as supervisors in the program . <> <> Feared and Revered // The Stones were both feared and revered . Some South Siders credit them with preventing the spread of the riots to the South Side when they engulfed the West Side in the fall of 1967 and again in 1968 , after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to force the city to set up apprentice programs in construction unions for blacks. // In the 1983 mayoral race , the Cook County Democratic organization paid them $10 , 000 to campaign in black neighborhoods and serve as poll watchers for Mayor Jane M. Byrne in her unsuccessful re-election bid . Last year , the Rev. Jesse Jackson publicly praised them for taking part in voter registration efforts in his Presidential campaign. // Earlier this year the local NBC-owned station , WMAQ , reported that the group had received loan guarantees from Sammy Davis Jr. , the entertainer , and Noah Robinson , a South Side businessman , as they tried to raise money to renovate their headquarters. // The group also owns the home of Mr. Fort ' s mother , two apartment buildings and two other buildings no longer in use . According to the office of Mr. Daley , the prosecutor now suing them in Cook County Circuit Court for delinquent taxes , the properties are worth $2. 5 million. // The Federal trial on the religious question began in mid-November and is being heard without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will resume on Dec. 30. //
