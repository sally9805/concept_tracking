An image emerges from shrouded memories of 20 years ago : Bobby Kennedy , hunched in a big chair in the Attorney General 's office hi September 1962 . His arms are wrapped around his legs , his sleeves are rolled up , his eyes are weary . He is engaged in another battle , which has mostly been the story of his young life . He is the field marshal , acting for his brother the President . They have been on the phone with Democratic Governor Ross Barnett of Mississippi , as the Federal Government presses its demand that James Meredith , a black student , be admitted to the all white University of Mississippi at Oxford . <P> The Kennedys ' fragile plan is coming apart , as black rage at injustice simmers across the South . Three times Meredith had tried to register and three times he had been refused . Tension has been building that would lead to riots and death . The National Guard and federal troops have been summoned . Meredith is not on campus yet . But there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . Barnett on the phone tells him and the President one thing , Bobby mutters , but then says another thing publicly . How do you deal with a man like that , he asks , not expecting an answer . Secret agreements are made , and they <P> vanish as soon as Barnett goes out to meet the press , says Bobby . Then he adds : But we 've got it down . We know what he said . <P> Taped . There it was . The real truth in the midst of veiled and chaotic maneuvering . Why not tape those conversations with the Governor ? What did it matter when one was battling for a just cause against an unscrupulous adversary ? In Bobby 's view of political combat , enemies often must be fought on their terms . The good of the nation and a higher morality demanded it . History would understand . <P> If the brothers learned anything in their first two years of power , it was , to use John Kennedy 's borrowed phrase , that " victory has a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had pondered his humiliation at the Bay of Pigs in April 1961 . Some day , he used to muse , he would write the story of the last White House meeting before that debacle , when Kennedy had gone around the table and extracted an opinion from each of his advisers . None foresaw disaster , he said . <P> None . But later some of them had much different memories of their positions . So in October 1962 , when he needed counsel on the Cuban missile crisis , he taped again . <P> As we have since learned , Kennedy did more taping . So did Roosevelt , Eisenhower , Johnson , Nixon , in various amounts , for what their chroniclers now suggest were various reasons . All were strong Presidents in different ways , yet all felt it necessary for protection to make secret records of what was said in the Oval Office . <P> Secret taping by Presidents has been generally condemned , but there may be another message in those reels and discs . There is no such thing as a casual conversation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidential word is a potential time bomb for good or bad , when it is carried out of the Oval Office to be used . Presidents know that . And visitors understand that what they say to a President can be just as explosive . It will always be so , and should be , as long as the office has the power it does .
