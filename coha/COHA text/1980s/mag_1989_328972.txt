Clamor is the usual condition in commodities pits . Last week , however , the soy-bean trading floor of the Chicago Board of Trade erupted in pandemonium as the C.B.O.T. issued an emergency order , its first in a decade , that July futures contracts in excess of 1 million bu. be liquidated . In one day soybean-futures prices plunged 5% , to $6.86 per bu . Traders speculated that a single buyer was trying to corner the market or drive up prices . The suspected culprit : Ferruzzi Finanziaria , Italy 's second largest privately held company and the third largest U.S. soybean processor since it bought Indiana-based Central Soya in 1987 . <P> Ferruzzi says its purchases  --  a reported 30 million bu. of soybeans in the past 18 months  --  were a legal effort to ensure adequate supplies for its customers . Many traders believe Ferruzzi 's two largest U.S. rivals , Archer Daniels Midland of Decatur , Ill. , and Cargill of Minneapolis , felt the pinch from rising prices and complained to the c.b.o.t . Said one trader : " Older , established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the block . " With prices taking a near panic dive , Ferruzzi has already lost an estimated $10 million . Harder hit may be U.S. soybean farmers , who last week saw the value of their total crop fall an estimated $500 million .
