KENNY ROGERS : DRAWING FULL HOUSES by Torn Anthony the scenes , attendance records that were set by the king of capacity , Elvis Presley , are being broken back out front . Kenny Rogers ' tour promoter and look-alike , C.R. Spurlock , admits , " What pleases me more than the numbers is the mix . The fans are evenly divided between old and young , male and female . " Looking out across a concert audience , you can see 12- to 60-year-olds lip sync to the hits . The TV monitors backstage in Cedar Rapids , Iowa , show an audience that looks very familiar . This time , however , the fans will serve as ambassadors to the world representing all the audiences who have gone before . A CBS film crew is working on the " Kenny Rogers ' America " television special ; an NBC crew is compiling a report for " David Brinkley 's Magazine " ; and another team is preparing a special to be seen around the world . There 's an electricity in the dressing rooms that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way dozens of times before . Everyone feels it , with one exception : Sitting on a folding chair in a large room of some two dozen people , Kenny Rogers nonchalantly strums a guitar to himself . It is at first uncomfortable referring to a grown man as " Kenny . " Fortunately , he 's a willing talker with a very reassuring , soft Texas drawl . His humility impressed me . In fact , someone once noted that if Guinness ever had a world 's record for modesty , Kenny Rogers might win . However , it was n't always that way . Kenny 's roller-coaster career has carried him into be a star . This was wild talk coming from a Houston tenement where this little boy was going to have enough problems just getting through school with astigmatism in one eye , which caused his pupils to dance around , making it difficult to focus . One of eight children , Rogers denies that being poor bothered him : " There may not have been much money , but there was a lot of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is merely a gauge of success . He contends , " The more money I make , the more things I know I 'm doing right . " As a child he wanted to be a star ; he never said anything about being rich . During his teen years , those childhood dreams were not forgotten . He reasoned that there were two roads on which to search for his dream : sports and music . Those were areas he enjoyed , and they offered the added benefit of being the two best arenas from which to attract girls . He admits , " I was n't a great athlete , and eventually I realized I could n't wreck my knees playing music , so I left sports . " The first Kenny Rogers ' hit was recorded when he was 19 . He appeared with his high school group on American Bandstand to perform " Crazy Feeling . " You do n't remember the song ? Do n't feel bad . About the only thing Kenny remembers is that " it was the most obscure million-selling record of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother Lucille says , " He never worked a day in his life . All that boy ever knew was singing . " Kenny grimaces when he hears those words ; then , with a smile , he reminds her , " That 's not strictly true ; I sold office supplies once . " There is a pause and a loud laugh as he remembers , " I got fired for taking long lunch breaks to play my guitar . " Since musical longevity usually comes from dues-paying and since his high school group did n't have a follow-up record , Kenny quietly slipped from million-selling obscurity into the Bobby Doyle Trio . The Kenny Rogers ' story begins in earnest with this group , and it reads like a history of music for the last 20 years : jazz , folk , psychedelic rock , rock , country/pop . He even recorded some disco music ( never released ) before " Lucille " finally made its way to the top of the charts . As jazz lost its appeal , Kenny cashed in on the last of the folk-music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little over a year later , he left to form The First Edition , initially a psychedelic act , then a " hip " soft-rock act . After almost a decade , the group was spinning at the end of the record ; Kenny decided to hit the reject button and try a solo career . He left the Edition with memories , a lot of practice performing before large audiences and a debt of $65,000 . In a $300-a-month apartment in Encino , California , a depressed Kenny Rogers sat and wondered how he was going to pay the rent . Music was all he knew , but the prospects of continuing that career seemed dim . It 's a hard fact of music life that it 's frequently tougher for someone who has had a string of hits to return to the top of the charts than it is for a new artist to barrel his way to the top . A long-time radio programmer admits there 's a " has-been " stigma attached to an " old pro , " and there is little support from DJs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prestige involved in helping a new act explode into the spotlight than there is in spinning the latest disc from an established artist . Ken Kragen , who had handled the business matters of The First Edition , worked out a strategy to get his client back on top . The key was country . At first it might appear that country music would be quite a culture shock for someone who popularized one of the classic psychedelic songs of the ' 60s . However , appearances can be quite deceiving in the entertainment industry . Surprisingly enough , " Just Dropped In ( To See What Condition My Condition Is In ) " was written by one of Nashville 's best songwriters , Mickey Newberry . Later , the roots of country sprouted the biggest First Edition hit ; " Ruby ( Do n't Take Your Love to Town ) " was written by Mel Tillis . Thus it 's understandable when Kenny explains , " Almost every singer can do several different types of music , but there 's usually only one he does best . I always thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've always done country music . I 've done exactly the same thing for 15 years . It just was n't merchandised as country before . Reuben James ' and ' Ruby ' were really country songs . The First Edition just happened to be merchandised as a pop group  --  a pop group doing country songs . Now I 'm a country artist who does songs salable in the pop market . " The trail was a long one , but his jazz , folk and rock successes were merely the qualifying prizes for the Grand Prize awaiting him in country music . Kenny Rogers learned quickly that familiarity breeds success . There may be no better ears in the music world today than his for recognizing hit records ( " those songs that sound familiar the first time you hear them " ) . Another familiar sound has carried him through all those changes in music . " I have one basic common denominator that has connected all my songs from ' Something 's Burning ' to You Decorated My Life ' ? and that is my voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of The First Edition can walk into a Kenny Rogers ' concert today and feel right at home . His stage presence evokes a special intimacy . Whenever possible , he walks off the stage and strolls into the audience , shaking hands or accepting a kiss . He loves that personal touch . Of course , it may also be a little devil in the man ; a member of the crew chuckles , " It drives the lighting and sound men nuts ! " After " The Gambler " ran up the charts like a runaway train , Rogers admitted he has always felt a little like a frustrated group singer ever since his early days . He claims it took a while to assimilate the proper stage actions that allow for the naturalness onstage that is now a Kenny Rogers concert trademark . He told Johnny Carson that today his stage shows are laid back : " I kinda go out onstage and hang around for an hour . " However , he admits with a smile , " The hardest thing I ever had to do was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you sing in a fast tempo , you ca n't walk in the same tempo or you 'd be running back and forth across the stage . My toes used to curl up , and I felt like I was going to trip every time I stepped on a mike cord . I had to learn to walk gracefully . " The lessons learned early in his road career are very apparent today . I have twice accompanied the Rogers ' entourage and have found that there are not a lot of rules  --  but those that do exist must be strictly observed . A little beer wo n't get anyone into trouble , but hard liquor had better be kept off the premises , and no one should even think of drugs on tour . Any drug use is grounds for immediate dismissal . Road life is a " floating tennis game , " since everyone in Kenny 's band , Bloodline , plays tennis . ( In fact , he has been teased for hiring musicians less for their music than for their backhand . ) There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general ingredients are much the same : makeshift dressing rooms and missed meals ; reservation errors and ever-changing schedules ; long days , short nights and few chances to catch your breath ; press by the busload and problems by the ton . The rigors of road life are also a necessary evil . Touring is one aspect , although an integral one , of an overall strategy . It 's the further evolution of that same game plan which first established the blend of mainstream pop and country music into a style that refuted any suggestion that never the twang shall meet . Kenny Rogers is simply as much a businessman as an entertainer . The line he sings with such ease ismerely the means toward an end bottom line that would make a blue-chip stock turn green with envy . In the last two years , Kenny has made about $50,000,000 . During the last five months of 1979 , while the rest of the music industry was singing the blues , his records sold a total of 10 million copies . Nevertheless , even those figures pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greatest Hits , which alone sold over 10 million copies in five months . It could conceivably become the largest-selling album ever by an American artist . Such favorable financial figures did n't just materialize one day on an accountant 's ledger . Kenny 's business-like and thoroughly intelligent approach to the music industry is best evidenced by his own admission that since becoming a solo artist he 's followed a " game plan . " " We knew exactly what we wanted to do and have not had to veer from that plan once . " The " we " is Kenny and Ken Kragen , a Harvard Business School graduate ( B.A. ) and former producer of " The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour . " The youthful-looking Kragen has been the driving force behind an extension to the original plan  --  acting . Before the tremendous ratings success of " The Gambler " ( the highest-rated TV movie in two years ) , skeptics dismissed such screen interest as a self-serving bout with " play-acting . " However , Kenny Rogers did n't accept the role for a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't at all easy to convince his client to even step in front of the camera . While on the set for their next TV movie , " The Coward of the County , " the manager/producer recalled what Kenny kept saying even after such remarkable initial success : " Kenny told people that ' The Gambler ' would probably be the only thing he would do moviewise , since he was doing fine in concerts and did n't think he wanted to change that . " Obviously , with Kenny only 200 feet away shooting a movie scene , that opinion had changed . " It took me two years of work , " says Kragen , " but Kenny 's finally getting excited about acting . " The initial reluctance was partly due to the lesson he learned while filming " The Gambler " ; a lot of acting is sitting around , barely enduring ennui while lights are set , scenery arranged and lines delivered for the 15th time . Rogers says , " Yeah , I feel more comfortable with that . I still do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm much more comfortable . " Since the country term for modesty has practically become " Kenny Rogers , " there 's a need to look elsewhere for an assessment of just what to expect in mid-fall when CBS presents " The Coward of the County . " The man in the director 's chair , Dick Lowry , acknowledges that the star has been doing his homework quite faithfully since they worked together on " The Gambler . " " Kenny has obviously been paying a lot of attention to performances ; he 's been going to movies , watching television and studying what he sees . " " The Coward of the County " features Kenny as the uncle to Tommy , the coward . Based on the gold record that told the story of Tommy , his girl , Becky , and their run-in with the Gatlin boys , the movie fleshes out the character of Matthew Spencer ( Kenny Rogers ) , the man into whose care Tommy is left after his father dies in prison . Fans are likely to be surprised at more than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of people may be expecting a western . " So was I , " says Rogers , laughing . " I do feel more comfortable in the Old West , but this takes place in 1941 , so it 's period , but not Old West . " This whole thing came about because I told Ken Kragen that if I was going to do another movie , I would want to do something a little different from myself , " Kenny explains . " I really love the idea of playing an evangelist preacher , kind of an Elmer Gantry character , " Viewing the dailies ( the developed film from the preceding day 's shooting ) , it 's apparent that " Coward " is something different . Dick Lowry and Steve Poster , the director of photography , have captured a visual warmth and cinematographic texture that carry the movie beyond regular TV fare . It 's representative of the thorough professionalism that Kragen and Company have developed a reputation for achieving in all of their endeavors . Kenny is understandably proud of all his accomplishments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little press coverage . Two years ago the Kenny Rogers Cerebral Palsy Center opened in Sikeston , Missouri . This , plus an above-average share of charity concerts and activities , does n't get much publicity because Rogers generally fidgets and moves nervously in his seat whenever the topic is broached . He fears people will believe he is out after praise and personal glory , so he does n't talk about it much : he just states quietly , " I try to give back as much as I get out of this business . " It appears in this he is successful , too . Kenny and his wife , Marianne , have recently been single-handedly propping up the Southern California housing industry ; the Rogers recently moved from their thoroughly renovated Italian Renaissance home in Bel-Air into a $15 million estate in Beverly Hills formerly owned by movie producer Dino de Laurentiis . At least one room ( maybe one wing ) will be set aside for some of the dozens of awards Kenny has gathered during the last few years . But he still insists his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regular on the long-running TV series featuring country singers Roy Clark and Buck Owens , " Hee Haw . " They met during the deep slump following the folding of The First Edition . Kenny could n't have been much more emotionally and financially drained . Marianne admits , " I was more concerned with his three marriages than I was with his financial position , but I think our relationship would not be nearly what it is now if it were n't for those marriages . " " Marianne taught me that success is n't everything , " Kenny explains , " but having someone to share your ups and downs with is . " Ironically , after he adopted this philosophy , he succeeded . The achievements of Kenny Rogers are now largely history . He 'll continue to evolve as an entertainer , but the imprint he has made on the music industry is already clear . In June of 1980 , the banjos and fiddles broke out in celebration of the announcement that for the first time ever , country music sales outdistanced pop , disco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularity . Critics may decry the urbanization of country music , and purists may weep over the homogenization of its sound , but the figures  --  which represent the listeners , the ones who really count  --  tend to support Kenny , who claims , " I think it 's the best thing that 's ever happened to country music . It 's brought a lot of people into the fold who otherwise would n't have listened to country music . It used to be you either liked country music or you did n't , because it all sounded alike . Now , it 's no longer one dimensional , and I think that 's great . "
