The British peace movement 's moral crusades against nuclear weapons have found political form in the British Labor Party 's promise to achieve a nonnuclear Britain upon gaining power . With Neil Kinnock , the Labor leader , ahead of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher by a few points in public opinion ' polls during most of 1986 , but trailing her by a few points recently , the politico-military establishments in Europe and the United States are preparing to mount the most damaging possible attacks on Labor 's appeal to the British electorate . In the last two days of November and the first week of December , Kinnock and his chief foreign policy adviser , Charles Clarke , visited the United - States to make Labor 's case to chosen audiences and the media . Kinnock will return in late February to try to reassure officials in the Reagan Administration and members of Congress that a Labor-governed , nonnuclear Britain would continue to be a loyal ally of the United States and a fully contributing member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization . Nevertheless , Labor rejects the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flexible response , " which Kinnock translates to mean " limited nuclear war " ? an implausibility , he says . This slowly developing but mortally serious controversy is the most basic political challenge from within NATO since the organization 's formation , in 1949 . " The policy is to get rid of British nuclear weapons  --  to cancel Trident , to decommission Polaris , to withdraw tactical nuclear weapons , " Kinnock told a group in Boston . The Greenham Common cruise missile base , the Moles-worth cruise missile facility ( if it is ever opened ) and the Poseidon base at Holy Loch , Scotland , where about half of the U.S. fleet of sixteen Poseidon submarines is stationed , will be closed . Nuclear weapons on F-111 aircraft will be removed . For sound historical reasons , there is skepticism in Britain about Labor 's , antinuclear promises . Harold Wilson cynically made such pledges and then , as Labor Prime Minister , just as cynically broke them . Yet last summer in London when I asked Bruce Kent , a leader of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he does . . " From day one , " Kinnock exclaimed in New York City in December , " they are no longer active nuclear weapons . " Upon Labor 's election , he continued , the weapons and related systems will be recalled and decommissioned . " We Ronnie Dugger , publisher of the Texas Observer , is writing a book on the ethical implications of nuclear weapons . would want the dismantling to commence immediately . . . . We want the cruise missiles withdrawn . " The exact timing , he said , remains " to some extent in the realm of guesswork , " and he indicated that the United States would be allowed reasonable time to comply . Pressed on the subject , Clarke said , " There are no circumstances that it would be more than three years , something like that , to carry things through . " The Labor Party has repackaged the agenda of the British peace movement into a political program . Some of the content is similar , but the movement 's moral arguments have been replaced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Labor wants to get rid of all nuclear weapons , but Kinnock pledges to spend all the money thereby saved on beefing , up Britain 's conventional military defenses . A Labor-governed Britain will stay " locked into NATO , " he asserted , but Labor will work within NATO for the adoption of a policy of no-first-use and a shift away from nuclear weapons to conventional ones . " In the Labor Party we stand for strong national defense and a strong contribution to NATO , which iS the fundament of our security , " Kinnock told Itis Boston audience . " Our country spends 95 percent of our defense spending and 5 percent of our gross national product upon that commitment to NATO . " Kinnock has not repudiated the moral considerations that underlie most opposition to nuclear weapons . To the contrary , in Boston he said he shares the conviction held not only by the political and religious critics of nuclear weapons but also by " those in the military who consider that the mass annihilation of life and the very means of life is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it is for others . " But he and his colleagues have made a political decision to confine their case against nuclear weapons almost entirely to pragmatic reasoning . Kinnock 's most elusive practical argument is also his most far-reaching one  --  that " nuclear weapons can not be used to defend Britain " because their use " would exterminate our country . " He quoted a former chief of the British defense staff : " To pose an unacceptable risk to the enemy automatically poses the same risk to oneself . " From the effects of the Chernobyl accident it is apparent , Kinnock said , that " even if a nuclear war could be confined to Europe . . . it would still be an irreversible cataclysm on a continental scale . " Furthermore , " ' limiting ' a nuclear war is inherently unlikely " and can not be expected , since the Russians have made it " absolutely clear " that they would not permit such a war to remain limited . Approvingly , Kinnock mentioned that the former British defense staff chief once said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of nuclear weapons , whether first use or in retaliation , would have made sense . " The size and location of our country means that using nuclear weapons would always be either pointless or self=destructive , or both , " Kinnock declared in Boston . " There is a common-sense consensus " in Britain about this . As Clarke put it , " If there is a nuclear ' exchange December 27 , 1986/January 3 , 1987 Th in Europe , that 's where we live , and we would be destroyed ; America would n't . " By extension Kinnock argues that nuclear deterrence itself is no longer rational . He cited Henry Kissinger 's 1979 state-ment that " it is absurd to base the strategy of the West on the credibility of mutual suicide . " And he went-on to quote the question Kissinger asked later that same year : " How can one go on telling a democratic public that its extermination is the best guarantee of its security ? It is a nonsensical proposition . " Kinnock maintains that making nuclear weap-ons more usable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less likely has indeed made the weapons more usable ilia nuclear war more likely . How-ever , he does not advocate unilateral nuclear disarmament by the United States without matching reductions by the Soviet Union . He explicitly advances the idea that the need for " com-mon security " between East and West is " the dominant re-ality of the modern world . " When asked in New York City if he would include the Soviet Union in common security , he replied : " Yeah , you ca n't have common security if you ex-clude it . " This expansion or , rather , transformation of the earlier idea of mutual security in alliance against the Soviet Union has also been surfacing in the U.S. peace movement . In 1983 , when Labor lost badly to the Thatcher conser-vatives , it seemed to Kinnock and his policy people that their stand on nuclear disarmament was one cause of their down-fall . " The way our policy was perceived was to have no de-fense , " Kinnock explained in New York City . In the past three years , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that " the British Labor Party has a policy committed to the effective defense of Britain . " Perhaps to emphasize that point , Kinnock makes some bellicose-sounding statements . In the course of discussing the military and fiscal efficiency of destroying a $3 million tank with a $15,000 antitank missile , or a $30 million fighter with a $1.5 million Patriot missile , he remarked : " We 're not going to fight the last war next time . " By dedicating the money now spent on nuclear weapons systems to conven- Nation . Collevef Libtuy Aelckac , - 13 . , Q tional defenses , he said , the British can increase their ability to prevent " the westward movement " of Soviet troops . Such warlike pronouncements may well be necessary to convince the British public that Labor can be trusted with the national security . They also arise from something relatively new in the antinuclear left : a will to reason out and arrange for the actual defense of a nation without nuclear weapons . Kinnock worked earnestly to convince his American listeners that he is committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe in the security of the United States , " he said , adding that after Britain goes nonnuclear , 132 of the 160 U.S.-owned military installations in Britain will be in place  --  early-warning sites , intelligence posts , airfields , storage and backup facilities . Clarke stressed , " There is nothing anti-American in our stance . " Kinnock has to reach wide to keep all his arguments in touch with one another . For instance , he denies charges made by Representative Stephen Solarz that Labor 's policy will cause a chain reaction against nuclear weapons in Europe , yet his party is committed to seeking " a nuclear-free Europe . " Asked about that goal directly , he granted , " Yes , I think it 's to be pursued , " but passed on quickly to more congenially aligned ideas . Until recently the Labor Party wanted to bar all nuclear weapons from British territorial waters . Kinnock now says that a Labor government would , allow U.S. vessels carrying nuclear weapons to make port calls , although they could not be stationed in British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zealand . " According to Kinnock , a policy like New Zealand 's enforced in British waters would gravely injure U.S. security interests . In barring nuclear vessels from its ports , New Zealand has expressed its desire not to be a Soviet nuclear target . Clarke said Britain can not hope for such a benediction as long as there are nuclear weapons in Europe ( notably , he might have added , just across the channel ) . Kinnock and Clarke specified that Labor will denuclearize Britain no matter what the Soveit Union does ; that is , that Labor 's policy is unilateral nuclear disarmafor Britain . Kinnock added , however , that Gorbachev has personally offered Britain a " comparable missile reduction " in exchange for British cuts . " It is n't a question of trusting , " he said . " It 's a question of saying , O.K. , let 's give it a try . " Clarke offered a more pointed retort to those who berate Labor for unilateralism . Reagan 's Strategic Defense Initiative is a " major unilateral step , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by people who are being unilateral in the other direction . " Those are the kinds of arguments Kinnock advanced during his trip to the United States . In Atlanta he spent time with his friend Mayor Andrew Young ; the guests at a gathering in his honor at New York University included McGeorge Bundy and Arthur Schlesinger Jr. ; in Boston , John Kenneth Galbraith was his host at a dinner . A few weeks earlier , in London , Kinnock had seen Senator Claiborne Pell , who will chair the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the new Congress , as well as Representative Solarz . In Washington , Kinnock visited privately with Senators Gary Hart , Edward Kennedy and Daniel Patrick Moynihan , former Senator Howard Baker and Representative Les Aspin . During an hour-and-a-half colloquy at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington ( which Kinnock skipped because , it was explained , that was the only time Senator Kennedy could see him ) , Clarke was assailed by William Arkin , the institute 's specialist on nuclear weapons , for Labor 's commitment to NATO . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Arkin said . As Britain goes nonnuclear , he predicted , the United States will withdraw from NATO and the organization will " fall apart . " Clarke told Arkin that he found his remarks " very insulting , actually . " Only " a tiny , tiny number of people " believe that British nuclear disarmament would destroy NATO . " There 's a very good chance that we will strengthen NATO . " How , Arkin came back , could Britain renounce nuclear weapons for itself yet continue in a nuclear NATO ? " The motivation of our policy is almost entirely practical and pragmatic , " Clarke replied ; Labor intends to try to persuade the organization to move away from nuclear weapons . Would Britain cease to participate , Arkin asked , in the Nuclear Planning Group ? Of course not , Clarke replied ; " We wish to be a part of the strategy of NATO . " " You 're going to be left with an affiance that 's still NATO , " Arkin said . But if Arkin meant that Britain , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he did not say that to Clarke . During the I.P.S. discussion Clarke permitted himself an interesting speculation . He had just explained that Labor 's nonnuclear policy was adopted partly because of the party 's sharply reduced confidence in prospects for arms control . He was asked : What if a new Democratic President urged Kinnock , as Prime Minister , to wait to go nonnuclear until the U.S. Administration had a chance to cut an arms control deal with the Russians ? " I would think that the President 's appeal would be something that Mr. Kinnock would respond to , " Clarke replied . I.F . Stone , seated across from Clarke , expressed the view that what Labor is advocating is " neither fish nor fowl , butis dictated by the necessity of achieving a wide consensus in a general election . " As an alternative , Stone suggested movement toward " a united Europe , " which would be , he said , the biggest of the then-three superpowers . Clarke circled Stone 's idea with evasive homilies . When one of the I.P.S. participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. strategic design than you think you are , " Kinnock 's chief policy adviser said Labor 's responsibility as a British political party is to devise the most effective way of defending Britain , along with Western Europe . If a Labor government was forced to choose between U.S. and British-European security , it would choose the latter , Clarke said , adding that he does not accept that such a choice has to be made . The question may devolve , he said , into what the United States and a nonnuclear Britain could contribute to each other 's defense . Thus , throughout the U.S. tour , Kinnock and Clarke hewed hard to the Labor position , ferociously when necessary . No doubt they are acutely aware of the political dangers in what they are attempting . For example , when a Democratic member of Congress expressed the opinion that a move to a nonnuclear defense will be perceived in the United States as British unwillingness to pull its weight in the Atlantic alliance , Kinnock was indignant . Britain will continue to pull its weight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it does now , by firmly securing conventional defenses instead of failing in the realms of both conventional and nuclear weapons . One reason for Labor 's recent rise in the British public 's esteem is Kinnock 's suppression of Trotskyists , who are called the Militant Tendency , in his party . In Boston and Washington , pro-Soviet American Trotskyists picketed him . The handout from the Spartacist League/U.S. called him a scabherder , Red-baiter , labor and class traitor . On the sidewalk in front of the National Press Building the day he spoke there , fifteen or so young Trotskyists marched in a tight oval carrying signs and chanting slogans . Led by a woman carrying a portable microphone and reading from a note pad , they called out together , " Down with NATO ! Defend the Soviet Union ! " The placards they carried said , among other things : " Honor Kim Philby ? Hate Neil Kinnock ! " " Bury the Stinking Corpse of Social Democracy , " " Judas Kinnock ! " " Hail Red Army Victory Over Hitler Fascism ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the USSR ! " The next British election could occur as soon as next May but not later than mid-1988 . Kinnock said in New York City that the " saliency " of the nuclear defense issue for the British voters is known to be in the range of 15 percent , compared with about four times that for domestic economic issues . Nevertheless , the defense issue could be critical for Labor again . Thatcher will attack Kinnock harshly on the subject . Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger damned Labor 's policy on British television , and just before Kinnock addressed the National Press Club , NATO 's troop commander , Gen. Bernard Rogers , did likewise . Defenders of nuclear NATO seem to be deciding that Kinnock is vulnerable to a threat that the United States will withdraw its troops from Europe if they are deprived of the " nuclear shield . " This has thrown Kinnock into the apparently awkward posture of emphasizing the need for American troops in Europe for the sake of U.S. as well as European security . Nuclear weapons issues have been convulsing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ambitious S.D.P. leader , David Owen , caustically opposes Kinnock 's nonnuclear policy , which he says will will make Britain " fearful , neutralist and third-rate . " The Liberals , who are closer to Kinnock than to Thatcher on the issue of defense , nevertheless are motivated to help the Alliance overtake Labor . I asked Kinnock if he thought Owen might join the Conservatives . Yes , he might , Kinnock replied . Would that hurt Labor 's chances of winning ? No , the contrary ! he said . Although he can be cutting to his foes , Kinnock is an articulate , intelligent and usually friendly man , quick and funny . On television he responds to topics of the day with facility , but brings the talk around , to the extent that he can , to his own points . His wife , Glenys , who joined him for part of his U.S. tour , has deeper roots in the British peace move , ment than he does . If Labor wins , according to an extremely well-placed source in London , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foreign Secretary will lodge in that key position a Labor elder who is thoroughly cynical about the goal of a nonnuclear Britain . Even Bruce Kent , when asked to describe what he visualizes if Kinnock takes over , thought a Labor victory might result in a stalemated situation , in some ways comparable to the one in Andreas Papandreou 's Greece . Nevertheless , Labor 's challenge to NATO 's arrangements of the past four decades is the antinuclear action in the West now , and before it 's over the whole world may be drawn into the fray . ?
