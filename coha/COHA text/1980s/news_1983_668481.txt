Boston Breakers defensive lineman Oudious Lee put it best : " It was Murphy ' s Law to the max . " The local team in the USFL , which had been on a four-game victory roll playing no-mistake football , waited for its first exposure on national television to embarrass itself for the first time this year . Fortunately , there were only 7984 of the 12,636 who bought tickets who dared to sit in the Nickerson Field stands at the start of a 3 1/2 - hour debacle that saw the Breakers dominated by the Oakland Invaders , 26-7 . There were only a couple hundred relatives and friends who survived a monsoon and the football to the bitter end . Unfortunately , the game over ABC-TV was televised locally as well as nationally , and what was shown can ' t help but hurt future attendance at Breakers games . " We got our butts beat , " was the opinion of Boston head coach Dick Coury . " Oakland outplayed us in both halves . We gave up a lot of turnovers and usually it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual the Breakers came at Oakland with still another offensive game plan . This was to be the two tight end day featuring Beau Coash and David Bayle . It worked enough to give Boston the first touchdown of the game . And then died , helped that way because Coash got banged up early . Though Boston displayed little pass rush , giving the league ' s leading passer , Fred Besana , seemingly hours to launch 219 yards passing ( 16 for 32 ) , Coury said he was " more disappointed over what we didn ' t do offensively . " In turn , Besana said it was the sudden emergence of Oakland ' s previously non-existent running game that made things happen for the Invaders . " This was our best offense all year , " he claimed . Besana went long to Wyatt Henderson seven times for 139 yards while keeping the Boston defense honest with running plays by Arthur Whittington and Ted Torosian who rolled up 73 and 77 yards , respectively . Whittington scored one touchdown and Torosian the other two . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 yards to the Oakland 18 and then Nolan Franz on the four . Richard Crump , who had 108 yards on 15 carries , most of it in the first half , dove over from the one at 2:25 into the second quarter . Boston had a chance to go up by a pair of touchdowns midway through the quarter after Ray Phillips recovered a fumble on the Oakland 27 . But Walton threw the ball directly into the arms of the Invaders ' Derrick Martin standing all alone in the end zone . " That interception helped them a lot , " said Walton . " We had a crossing pattern and I didn ' t see that defensive back . There were so many people standing around in back of that end zone . As many mistakes as we could have made , we made them . " Instead of being up by 14 , Boston had to stand around and watch Oakland drive 80 yards in 11 plays with Besana reading a Breakers blitz beautifully , dumping off passes for 14 and 23 yards as the key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball right back on a Crump fumble and Kevin Shea kicked a 23-yard field goal to give the Invaders a 9-7 first-half lead . Oakland took complete charge in the third quarter . Besana mounted one drive for 65 yards and a touchdown that ate up 4:20 , and then , after Boston messed up a field goal attempt with a bad snap , drove the Invaders once again , 36 yards in 9 plays , to put them up 23-7 at the 10:54 mark . Almost everyone left or bordered on drowning by the final quarter that saw more Breakers miscues and only a single scoring play , a 44- yard Shea field goal . " They came in desperate , " said Breakers defensive leader Phillips of the Invaders who had lost two in a row and had dropped to 2-3 on the year . " They wanted the game more than we did today . We knew they had a talented team . They came in and proved it . " Tim Mazzetti , the league ' s leading scorer , continued his perfect point- after kicking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a streak of nine field goals in a row because his one chance yesterday wasn ' t an attempt thanks to a bad snap from center . The loss dropped the Breakers to 4-2 on the year and knocked them out of first place in the Atlantic Division as Philadelphia beat Los Angeles to move to 5-1.
