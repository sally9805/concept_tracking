AS " the story of two generations of a family whose ruling passion is not success or money or love , but social justice , " Sidney Lumet ' s film " Daniel " - thus described by Mr. Lumet and by E. L. Doctorow , whose screenplay is based upon his own novel - is a work of noble and unusual ambitions . That these ambitions become the film ' s most admirable element is a sign of just how difficult it must have been to bring this material to the screen , as well as an indication of problems that are more mundane. // As was the case with Mr. Doctorow ' s " Ragtime , " history and fiction are mingled here , in a manner that is innovative but that can also become confusing . Audiences not closely familiar with the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg may not be certain where they differ from Mr. Doctorow ' s Paul and Rochelle Isaacson , whose story is told here in highly compassionate terms ( the film views their fate as abhorrent , though it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilt ) . While it does not present a new argument about the Rosenbergs ( as does the current book " The Rosenberg File : A Search for the Truth , " in which Ronald Radosh and Joyce Milton postulate the guilt of Julius Rosenberg and at least the complicity of his wife ) , its more bombastic passages amount to an indirect partisanship that will undoubtedlty fuel the continuing controversy surrounding the case. // " Daniel , " which opens today at the Coronet Theater , incorporates its thinly fictionalized version of the Rosenberg story into a larger family drama : that of a son searching to determine the truth about his parents , and through this quest finally coming to terms with their values and their legacy . This material hardly lends itself to any standard movie treatment . Imagine a courtship scene between two young radicals , as the young man passionately lectures his future bride about the means of production , and you may have some idea of how idiosyncratic " Daniel " can be . With Paul Robeson singing on the soundtrack , and with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vignettes set in the late 1930 ' s and early 40 ' s , " Daniel " means to evoke a powerful sense of the radical left in that period . But its use of these memories , and of the passions they arouse , is less sure than its ability to conjure them up. // In Mr. Doctorow ' s novel " The Book of Daniel , " the title character is the grown son of the Isaacsons , who , like the Rosenbergs , have been convicted and executed for participating in a conspiracy to commit atomic espionage . The very narration of the novel , as Daniel tries to keep to the third person but frequently lapses into the first , is a measure of the intensity of his struggle . Daniel ' s bitterness throughout the book is a vital part of his efforts to come to terms with his parents ' histories and with his own . The two generations are seen as closely intertwined , chiefly through anguish the son exhibits while he relives his parents ' nightmare. // The film is less passionate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces . It begins with an extreme close-up of a scowling , furious Daniel ( Timothy Hutton ) as he recites a definition for electrocution , and this device is repeated periodically throughout the film ( with Daniel explaining a different form of punishment in each instance ) . These scenes , which are all that remain of the narrator ' s tone , effectively capture Daniel ' s rage - but do not convey that his struggle is painful and continuing , and that he is in the process of change . As a result , much of the movie is angry and self- righteous , without sufficiently close links between Daniel ' s story and that of his parents , and without the sympathetic elements that make the novel a complex , human story , rather than a tract. // Mr. Doctorow ' s screenplay would seem to be a lot like his novel ; indeed , many of the passages of dialogue are virtually the same . The trouble is that they have been transported whole , so that they now become overbearing speeches . Scene after scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cast , like the casts of most recent Lumet films , is enormous - launches into a windy and uninterrupted soliloquy . Mr. Lumet , far from keeping the histrionics in check , seems to have actively encouraged his actors to go for broke during each one ' s show-stopping minute or two . The film ' s dramatic progress is repeatedly halted as actors in minor roles indulge themselves to the utmost , offering what are clearly meant to be bravura turns. // This isn ' t a film that can easily withstand so many interruptions , since its structure is already fragmented . In addition to intercutting Daniel ' s late-1960 ' s story with that of his parents , Mr. Lumet also fractures time within the flashbacks ; when the Isaacson family boards a bus to attend a Paul Robeson concert in Peekskill , N.Y. ( which would later develop into a riot ) , they aren ' t seen arriving until almost an hour later . Of course , this isn ' t forgetfulness on Mr. Lumet ' s part . It ' s consistent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story and saving for last all the scenes that are unavoidably wrenching . The film ends with two lengthy , detailed electrocution sequences , followed by two funeral scenes , followed by a coda that can not help being uplifting . This is moving , and then some - it ' s enough to make the audience feel clobbered. // " Daniel " has been directed in what is immediately recognizable as Mr. Lumet ' s recent style . There is somber , stylized lighting . There are plenty of long shots . And there is unusual casting , which is ordinarily one of the things this director does best . Here , though , there are too many moments in which the casting undercuts the film ' s plausibility . For instance , John Rubinstein does a good job as Daniel ' s stepfather , but he simply doesn ' t look much older than Mr. Hutton or than Amanda Plummer , who plays his sister . The members of the Isaacson family don ' t much resemble one another , either . And Lindsay Crouse , who as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one scene dances around a room like Tevye , still has traces of the brogue she used as an Irish nurse in Mr. Lumet ' s " Verdict . " Miss Crouse , along with Edward Asner as the Isaacsons ' lawyer , gives the kind of heavy , sturdy performance that is the order of the day here . The few actors who attempt anything more offbeat - like Ellen Barkin , who has a scene-stealing presence in the tiny role of Daniel ' s wife - are left with little to do . Miss Plummer brings a frightening urgency to the role of Daniel ' s troubled sister , but she ' s almost too real and unpredictable for her surroundings here . Ilan M. Mitchell-Smith and Jena Greco do a good job playing childhood versions of Daniel and his sister . Mr. Hutton has some fine moments , particularly in the latter part of the movie . But his role , as written and edited , lacks context and continuity. // If the book succeeds in emerging finally as Daniel ' s story , the movie remains more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patinkin - who has some very touching moments with Daniel as a boy , explaining the hidden radical messages in everything from a day at the beach to a Wheaties package - both work very hard at those key characterizations . And at the last minute the movie spoils it all. // When Rochelle says goodbye to her children , even the tiny daughter has been directed to walk across the room and pause dramatically while speaking . Their mother has hardly flown out the door when , seconds later , in rushes their father , behaving like a punch-drunk Jimmy Durante . These are the moments when the audience hardly needs to see showy acting , when instead it needs to believe it is seeing a family caught in an agony of unprecedented dimension . <> <> A Son ' s Search <> DANIEL , directed by Sidney Lumet ; screenplay by E.L.
