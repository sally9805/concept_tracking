Senator Mark Hatfield had two assets working for him as he faced a preliminary inquiry of the Senate Ethics Committee into his wife 's financial dealings with a Greek businessman . One was the Oregon Republican 's long reputation for integrity . The other was Hatfield 's admission that he had made a serious error of judgment in helping to promote Entrepreneur Basil Tsakos ' planned $6 billion oil pipeline in Central Africa . <P> Tsakos had paid Hatfield 's wife Antoinette $55,000 for helping him find and decorate an apartment in Washington . <P> Two disgruntled former employees of Tsakos testified that Mrs. Hatfield had performed no broker or decorating services for the financier . But last week the Ethics Committee staff concluded that there was insufficient evidence to determine that the fee paid Mrs. Hatfield , a real estate broker , was meant as a bribe to her husband and urged the Senate committee to drop the matter . The Ethics Committee is expected to agree this week . The Justice Department also seems likely to come to a similar conclusion after a preliminary FBI investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
