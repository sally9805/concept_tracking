Nuclear pacifists question the " just war " theory <P> In successive days , scientists sent by the Vatican met directly with President Reagan , France 's Francois Mitterrand , Britain 's Margaret Thatcher and , extraordinarily , the Soviet Union 's Leonid Brezhnev . Carefully designed to reimpress the world 's leaders with the horrific biological results of nuclear war , the mission was one more indication of the new urgency that Pope John Paul II attaches to battling the nuclear threat . <P> The Pope is far from alone among church leaders . Lutheran , Calvinist and Roman Catholic clergy were among the early organizers of Europe 's widespread antinuclear movement . In the U.S. a growing number of pastors and prelates are taking up the chant . The movement is not limited to predictable leftist or pacifist church circles ; it has entered the religious mainstream . This month the 37 regional executives of the American Baptist Churches called the very existence of nuclear weapons , much less willingness to use them , " a direct affront to our Christian beliefs . " The bishops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all other issues pale " by comparison . Billy Graham sees a moral crisis that " demands the attention of every Christian . " <P> Activists are urging confrontation . The radical Evangelical magazine Sojourners calls for prayerful protests at all U.S. nuclear facilities . Seattle 's Roman Catholic Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen suggests a tax boycott . In Amarillo , Texas , Bishop L.T. Matthiesen is asking employees to quit work at the nearby Pantex plant , which assembles nuclear bombs .

Says Pastor John Thursby of Lyme , Conn. : " God would not be pleased if we return his creation to him in ashes . " Other local congregations are backing a months-long , nationwide Peace March to the U.N . <P> Christianity , of course , has not generally been pacifist , subscribing instead to St. Augustine 's " just war " theory . That theory , argues San Francisco 's Catholic Archbishop John Quinn , requires that a licit conflict must produce more good than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On those criteria , says Quinn , " it could never be morally justified to use strategic nuclear weapons . " <P> Since 1976 , the U.S. Catholic hierarchy as a whole has opposed both the use of nukes and any threat to fire them , but the bishops are divided on whether it is moral even to possess them as part of a deterrent strategy . In his Christmas message to Catholic military chaplains , Terence Cardinal Cooke of New York stated that deterrence was not satisfactory or safe , but could be considered morally " tolerable , " so long as the U.S. seeks disarmament in good faith . But that once commonplace view is now being questioned . The Cardinal 's talk drew immediate criticism .
