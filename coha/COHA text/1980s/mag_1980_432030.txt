 | Once again , President Carter is gambling on summit diplomacy to close a breach between Egypt and Israel in an effort to salvage Mideast peace . Just as he did at Camp David in 1978 , Carter hopes to persuade Egyptian President Anwar Sadat during Sadat 's April 7-10 visit to Washington and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin , scheduled to arrive on April 15 , to compromise so far unresolvable differences . This time the issue is self-rule for Palestinians on the West Bank of the Jordan River and in the Gaza Strip . Why is Carter personally taking a hand in Egyptian-Israeli talks at a time he also is confronted by the problems of Iran and Afghanistan ? Answers to this and other questions come from our correspondents in Washington and the Middle East . What is the U.S. stake in the talks ? If Sadat-Begin negotiations break down , America could wind up one of the biggest losers of all . A stalemate over the Palestinians would come at a time when the entire Mideast and its vital oil supplies are threatened by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invasion of Afghanistan . Carter has sought to meet the Soviet challenge by lining up friends , allies and bases in the Arab world . A new Mideast crisis would imperil that strategy . What exactly are negotiations between Egypt and Israel all about ? Sadat and Begin are trying to fashion a plan for self-government for the 1.2 million Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip , both occupied by Israel since the 1967 Mideast war . The Camp David accords signed by the two leaders in September , 1978 , call for the election of a Palestinian council to administer home rule for a five-year transitional period . During that time , a new set of negotiations are to start to determine the final status of the occupied Arab land . Target date for producing a workable autonomy formula is May 26 . Why ca n't they reach agreement ? To Egyptians , home rule the West Bank is major issue in self-rule talks . means that the Palestinians should be given a full range of powers ? the same ones that Israel 's military government now exercises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formula might lead to a Palestinian state , which they reject as a threat to their country 's future security . So Begin offers only severely restricted local rule over such things as education , health and ordinary municipal affairs . Has there been any progress at all after all these months of talks ? Agreement has been reached only on relatively unimportant matters ? for instance , how the machinery to elect a Palestinian council should be set up . Is the May 26 target date important ? May 26 marks no formal deadline , but failure to make at least some headway by then could spark repercussions inside and outside of the Middle East . Israel already is under mounting criticism abroad for its settlements policy and narrow interpretation of autonomy , and would face even more isolation and condemnation . Egypt , a pariah in the Arab world for signing a peace with Israel , would find itself even more of an outcast for having " sold out the Palestinians . " More ominously , the deadlock could lead to suspension of the autonomy talks altogether and strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the specific problems ? There are five key issues : Powers of the Arab council . Control of water and land . Future of the more than 63 Israeli settlements established on the West Bank and in Gaza since 1967 and inhabited by about 14,000 Jews . Israel 's right to freely move its troops in and out of military enclaves on the West Bank to guard against aggression and maintain internal order . Status of the 100,000 Arabs of East Jerusalem , particularly whether they would be allowed to vote in elections for the Palestinian council . What is Egypt 's position ? Sadat wants the council to have full executive , judicial and legislative powers , including control over the land and its water . Israeli military and civil supervision should end immediately after elections , and Israeli settlements , which Cairo says are illegal , eventually must be dismantled . To the Arabs , East Jerusalem is part of the occupied West Bank and must be returned to Arab hands . While not opposing a Palestinian state outright Sadat prefers that the West Bank and Gaza become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ links to Israel . Where does Israel disagree ? Begin believes that granting the Palestinians anything more than a say in routine matters would set the stage for a Palestinian state that eventually would attack Israel . He regards the West Bank , which he calls Judea and Samaria , as part of the land promised to Jews in the Bible , and he insists that Israelis have a right to settle there . The Begin government also  | contends that Israel must retain responsibility to guard against outside attack and internal disorder . Israel has annexed the Arab section of Jerusalem , claims the city as its capital , and vows it never again will be divided . Where does the U.S. stand in all this ? Carter has made clear that America has twin goals ? to insure Israel 's security and to help West Bank and Gaza Arabs obtain " legitimate rights " in a homeland ? but not a state ? of their own . He considers the settlements to be a violation of international law and an obstacle in achieving those goals . He agrees that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not recognize the city as Israel 's capital and rejects its annexation of East Jerusalem . The U.S. sees East Jerusalem as occupied Arab land whose final status should be negotiated . Ca n't Carter pressure the two sides to come to terms ? Both Egypt and Israel want the U.S. to force the other to give ground . The fact is that , despite massive amounts of U.S. aid going to both countries , Carter has little actual leverage . Complicating his task is his reluctance to alienate supporters of either side in the U.S. during an election year . Why are n't the Palestinians themselves taking part in the negotiations ? Virtually all Arab leaders of the West Bank and Gaza reject the self-rule plan laid out at Camp David . They demand self-determination ? a code word for nationhood and independence . Moreover , Arabs say only the Palestine Liberation Organization headed by Yassir Arafat can serve as their spokesman and negotiator . But Israel insists it will never negotiate with the PLO , which it regards as a terrorist organization dedicated to the destruction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until 1967 and still has strong links there , also has shunned the Camp David process . A major aim of the meetings in Washington will be to come up with a formula appealing enough to convince both Palestinians and Jordan 's King Hussein to join future talks . Is there any alternative to Carter 's peacemaking efforts ? West European and Arab countries are coming up with ideas of their own . More non-Arab nations are granting the PLO formal diplomatic recognition , and initiatives are under way to win United Nations endorsement of a Palestinian state . There also are European plans to convene a new Mideast conference ? with the PLO sitting in ? if U.S.-sponsored talks fall apart . That 's why Carter felt compelled to assume the mediator 's role again . U.S. Commitment to Israel : More Than Just Words Despite disagreement with Israel over the Palestinian issue , the official commitment of the U.S. government to the Jewish nation is stronger now than at any time in history . America has had special ties with Israel from the start and by next September will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic aid and 12.9 billion in military assistance . Military aid consists of about 7.7 billion in loans and the remainder in grants . Every U.S. President since 1948 has voiced support for Israel . Yet Jimmy Carter , determined to make the Camp David peace accords a success , has gone a step further than his predecessors . His is the first administration to make that pledge in a diplomatic document . In a " memorandum of agreement " signed on March 26 , 1979 , between the U.S. and Israel as part of the Camp David package , Washington formally promised to " endeavor " to come to Israel 's aid with military and economic assistance if the peace treaty with Egypt is violated . Another memorandum commits the U.S. for 15 years to supply Israel with oil at world prices if Israel is cut off from its normal sources . The accord was designed to persuade Israel to return captured oil wells in the Sinai desert to Egypt . The Carter administration also is providing Israel with 3 billion dollars to finance its withdrawal from the Sinai ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a 10-year loan . Carter 's efforts to bolster the treaties and to enhance Israeli security follow a long tradition of American support for Israel . Key statements made by U.S. Presidents over the last 30 years include : President Truman . Oct. 28 , 1948 , five months after the Jewish state was founded : " It is my desire to help build in Palestine a strong , prosperous , free and democratic state . It must be large enough , free enough , and strong enough to make its people self-supporting and secure . " President Eisenhower , Jan. 5 , 1957 : " We have shown ... our dedication to the principle that force shall not be used internationally for any aggressive purpose and that the integrity and independence of . . . the Middle East should be inviolate . " President Kennedy , May 8 , 1963 : " We support the security of both Israel and her neighbors . " President Johnson , May 23 , 1967 : " I wish to say what three Presidents have said before ? the U.S. is firmly committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the nations of the area the Mideast . " This has been the policy of the United States led by four Presidents ? President Truman , President Eisenhower , President Kennedy and myself as well as the policy of both of our political parties . " President Nixon , on June 1 , 1972 , told Congress that during a visit to Moscow he had " reiterated the American people 's commitment to the survival of the state of Israel . " President Ford , Sept. 10 , 1974 : " We are committed to Israel 's survival and security . " President Carter , Jan. 23 , 1979 : " Our firm commitment to Israel 's survival and security is rooted in our deepest convictions and in our knowledge of the strategic importance to our own nation of a stable Middle East . " Differences over settlements and Palestinian self-rule make Israelis nervous about the depth of U.S. support . But Israel has American promises on paper and can hold the White House accountable .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
