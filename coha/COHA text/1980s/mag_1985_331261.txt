The occasion : a press conference for Cardiologists Dr. Bernard Lown of the U.S. and Dr. Yevgeni Chazov of the Soviet Union , co-chairmen of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War , the group that won this year 's Nobel Peace Prize . Journalists were haranguing Chazov for having signed a 1973 letter that attacked Andrei Sakharov , the dissident Soviet physicist who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975 . Suddenly , a Soviet television reporter collapsed onto the floor . <P> Lown and Chazov tore off their suit jackets , sprang from the podium and , along with other IPPNW physicians in the room , gave the fallen man cardiopulmonary resuscitation . The victim , Lev Novikov , 60 , was put on a stretcher and taken to an Oslo hospital , where officials reported that he had suffered a heart attack . Novikov was later described as out of danger . Skeptics said that his collapse may have been staged , an allegation that Lown called " perverse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have now witnessed that it goes well for Soviets and Americans to cooperate in this task .
