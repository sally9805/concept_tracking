I SHOULD N'T BE TELLING YOU THIS by Mary Breasted <P> Harper &; Row ; 361 pages ; $15.95 <P> BYLINES by Bernard Weinraub <P> Doubleday ; 590 pages ; $17.95 <P> DEADLINES by Desmond Ryan <P> Norton ; 285 pages ; $15.50 <P> Deep in the desk of every hardbitten , wisecracking , deadline-haunted reporter , alongside the bourbon and the Maalox , is an unfinished novel . Typically , the manuscript is not about great events but about what is truly important to the journalistic fraternity : sex , office politics , money , fame and lunch . That , at least , is the message of these three novels by and about newspaper reporters . <P> The most entertaining of the trio , I Shouldn ' t Be Telling You This , is former New York Times Reporter Mary Breasted 's fondly cynical story of a young Radcliffe graduate named Sarah Makepeace . She moves from freelancing for the Evil Eye , a leftist Greenwich Village weekly that resembles the Village Voice ( where Breasted once labored ) , to a coveted staff job on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Times . Sarah 's boss is City Editor Ron Millstein , an endearingly manic liar who does not resemble Times Editors Arthur Gelb and A.M. Rosenthal . After spending weeks trying to find city hall by subway , committing Pulitzer-worthy sex with an undercover policeman and discovering the delights of midtown restaurants , she stumbles upon the Big Story : how a presidential candidate tried to have his homosexual lover bumped off . <P> The struggle for that scoop is only a minor episode in a far more epic battle : the one between Millstein and the national editor for the job of editor in chief . Indeed , to the Newspaper 's scribblers , nearly every event in the newsroom , and in the world at large , is important only in terms of office intrigue . " When the copy editors crossed your commas out , people made an interpretation of your standing vis-a-vis Ron and of Ron 's standing vis-a-vis the national editor and of both their standings in the eyes of the editor in chief and of the publisher in the great beyond , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to write a good lead or tell the difference between comptroller and controller ? More important , will she ever get her Big Story into print ? In the end , she begins to grasp the cynic 's first rule of journalism : the most important byline is the one on the paycheck.
