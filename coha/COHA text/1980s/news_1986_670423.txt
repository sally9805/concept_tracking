The stay came more than two years after settlement of a lawsuit by Vietnam veterans against seven chemical manufacturers , and just two days before parts of the plan were to take effect . The stay , ordered Tuesday in Manhattan by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit , was announced yesterday by Federal District Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Brooklyn , in whose court the plan had been set up. // In one of many strange twists in the eight-year-old case , the stay was sought by lawyers heading the veterans ' case . The lawyers argued that the distribution plan failed to connect the veterans ' ailments to their exposure to Agent Orange and thus ignored a fundamental contention of the veterans. // // Link to Chemical Disputed // The distribution was based on a key ruling by Judge Weinstein that it was scientifically and legally unfeasible to connect the ailments to Agent Orange exposure . Instead , the judge decided , awards would be made on the degree of disability , regardless of cause. // But some veterans groups have contended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service-related . They also say they were more eager to establish corporate and government responsibility for their condition than to win a cash grant. // The veterans ' lawyers asserted that contrary to Judge Weinstein ' s ruling , there was enough evidence to link Agent Orange to ailments , and that those veterans most likely to have been made ill by the herbicide should get the most money. // It was not clear from the terse order by three appeals court judges whether the panel had serious objections to the plan or only wanted to review it. // Judge Weinstein , who had approved the plan and was to announce its first financial managers Thursday , issued his own order postponing some work. // The judge ' s so-called special master for the plan , Kenneth R. Feinberg , a Washington lawyer , termed the delay " terribly unfortunate . " <> <> Tears From a Veteran // The president of Vietnam Veterans Agent Orange Victims Inc . , Frank McCarthy , first learned of the delay from a reporter ' s telephone call and could not contain his tears. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , choking back sobs . " I got no more hope. " // He said that while proposed cash grants under the distribution plan were meager , many veterans who were sick or had birth-deformed children had set great store by a $50 million foundation to counsel and aid veterans and their families. // " I just can ' t believe it , " he said of the stay . " It ' s the worst scenario I can think of . It ' s absolutely devastating . The implications are horrifying . " Fund Set Up in 1984 At issue is the disposition of what was a $180 million fund provided by seven Agent Orange manufacturers under the settlement of the lawsuit , reached May 7 , 1984 . The fund , invested in time-deposits at Citibank , has since grown to about $225 million. // If the stay had not been granted , Mr. Feinberg said , the first payments could have gone out between Thanksgiving and the end of the year. // Despite the settlement , the chemical companies maintained there was no proven connection between dioxin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The seven companies are the Dow Chemical Company , the Monsanto Company , the Diamond Shamrock Corporation , Uniroyal Inc. , the T. H. Agriculture and Nutrition Company , the Thompson Chemical Company and Hercules Inc . <> <> No Statement From Companies // The companies have taken no position on the distribution of the fund and made no statement yesterday. // The number of potential claimants was not known when the settlement was reached . Since then , about 250 , 000 Vietnam veterans and family members have filed injury claims . The number was far larger than anticipated and means that if the fund were to be divided equally , each claimant would get no more than $1 , 000. // Instead , as devised by Judge Weinstein and Mr. Feinberg , about $50 million was to go to a foundation to finance services to ill veterans and family members. // The remainder was to go to survivors of dead claimants and to those suffering total disability . The death benefits would go to about 18 , 000 families over 10 years and average about $1 , 800 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go to about 31 , 000 veterans , and average $5 , 700 with a $12 , 000 maximum . <> <> ' Chump Change ' // " The majority do not want a welfare giveaway where chump change is distributed to shut them up , " said Victor John Yannacone Jr. , a Long Island lawyer who brought the original Agent Orange lawsuit in 1978 and later was eased out of the litigation after disputes with other lawyers and the court. // Mr. Yannacone yesterday applauded the appeal court ' s stay as an opportunity to redraft the fund plan to provide for a study of the causes of the veterans ' health problems. // The lawyers who were named by the court to head the veterans ' class-action suit as the Plaintiff Management Committee , and who filed July 31 for the appeal court stay , were Neil R. Peterson and Eugene Locks of Philadelphia and Thomas W. Henderson of Pittsburgh . None of the three returned phone calls to their offices yesterday. // The stay was issued in an order by 3 of the appeals court ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ K. Winter and Roger J. Miner , who apparently conferred by telephone . <> <> Announcement Delayed // It came less than 48 hours before Judge Weinstein was to announce the names of two banks he had selected to manage the investments of the fund and the insurance company he had picked to review the claims. // After he learned of the stay yesterday , Judge Weinstein issued his own order directing Mr. Feinberg " to postpone distribution of funds to veterans and their families. " // The judge also called a halt to any work by the companies to be named today . He said , however , that work would resume within five days of the lifting of the stay , if it were lifted. // Meanwhile , Judge Weinstein ordered that the computer center continue to maintain files of claimants and that the 24-hour , toll-free numbers continue to dispense information about the case to veterans and family members . In New York State , the number is ( 800 ) 832-1303 ; outside New York it is ( 800 ) 645-1355. //      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
