txt In the national library at the Palace of Culture , the foreign reading room does n't have a single U.S. publication , and when the librarian is asked for a copy of the Soviet newspaper Pravda she replies with an angry " nyet . " But a quick look under her desk when her back is turned reveals a pile of China 's People 's Daily . That little drama speaks much of Albania 's relations with the outside world . The U.S. and the Soviet Union are officially despised as superpowers and imperialists . The Chinese . however , after a period of equal revilement , appear to be tiptoeing back into favor . According to diplomats in Tirana . the capital of this isolated European country , a Chinese trade delegation slipped into Albania a few weeks ago . It was the first official contact between Tirana and Peking since Communist Party leader Enver Hoxha ( pronounced HOD-4a/n turned on his former benefactors in 1978 . It 's believed that the Chinese have agreed to renew economic ties with Tirana , which Mr. Hoxha severed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tse-tung in 1976 . Renewed trade would enable the Albanians to pay off  --  by barter trade through the end of the century  --  debts to China thought to total the equivalent of $5 billion . It would also mean that Albania will be getting spare parts for the huge amount of military and civilian equipment supplied by the Chinese before the break . New Alliances ? But what 's in it for the Chinese , other than getting repaid and getting supplies of Albanian chrome ore ? Diplomats believe that the Chinese are becoming increasingly anxious about Albania 's future alliances after ailing party boss Hoxha passes from the scene . Peking may also be acting in the interests of Albania 's neighbors . Yugoslavia and Greece . who are fearful that the Soviets could step in to fill the vacuum that would be left by Mr. Hoxha 's death . Western analysts point out that this tiny country of 2.8 million people is in a strategic location on the Adriatic , with excellent deep-water ports . At its closest , it is a mere 50 miles from the Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albania could become either pro-Soviet or pro-Chinese , " says one Western diplomat with long experience in Albania . Renewed Soviet friendship would seem unlikely given the steady stream of abuse that Mr. Hoxha has directed at Moscow since 1961 when the Albanians broke with their former Stalinist friends who by then wei e being viewed as Khrushchev " revisionists . " For years the Soviets simply ignored the name-calling . But after the Alb.unans fell out with the Chinese ( because they considered that Peking , too , had abandoned the road of true Marxism ) , Moscow began calling for the normalization of relations with Tirana . In November , Moscow again sent a - let 's be friends " message on Albania 's national liberation and independence anniversaries . Within days the Albanian party newspaper , Zerii Popullit , published a stinging editorial  --  possibly written by Mr. Hoxha himself  --  dismissing Soviet Communist Party leader Yuri Andropov as a " policeman " and calling him incompetent . " As far as our country is concerned , it has had no links with Khrushchev , it will not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually heads the revisionist Soviet Union , " fumed the editorial . The Soviet Union does n't give up easily on a former ally . The Czechoslovak diplomatic mission in Tirana has long acted as the Soviet representative in Albania . But in recent months the Bulgarians have beefed up their representation in Tirana , apparently in the Soviet cause . Western diplomats say that a top Bulgarian . the man in charge of Balkan affairs on the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party , is now Bulgaria 's acting charge d'affaires in Tirana . Invective for the U.S. The U.S .. however , has n't any such intimate eyes and ears at its command in Albania . Some Western diplomats complain that Washington , in fact , takes little or no interest in Albania . Occasionally the U.S. State Department considers making a new approach to Albania , but it appears to be quickly dissuaded by Mr. Hoxha 's invective , which views the U.S. as " a ferocious enemy of freedom . " The anti-U.S . stance is partly for ideological reasons ? " being antisuperpower has turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyst for Radio Free Europe in Munich . But there are also wounds from the past , particularly from Washington 's support of an abortive invasion of Albania by anticommunist exiles in 1949 . The U.S. also earns Albanian resentment because it supervises , along with Britain and France , the holding of $36 million of Albanian gold , plundered by Italian forces in World War II and recovered by the Allies after the war . The gold has n't been returned largely because of Britain 's claim that Albania owes it S1.3 million in damages from a 1946 incident in which two British destroyers hit mines off the coast of Albania , killing 44 men . The British blamed the Albanians . Thus , with its back turned on the U.S. , the Soviets and the Chinese , the Albanians have tried to pursue a policy of self-reliance . The result , analysts say , is that today Albania is the poorest country in Europe with a per-capita income of only $840 a year . At the same time , Albania has the highest population growth rate in Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is becoming increasingly difficult , and the Hoxha regime has been forced to hold down the standard of living to put scarce funds into heavy industry . Clearly the party realizes that development is impossible without outside help , and it has started a policy of gradually improving economic relations with a select number of small and medium-sized countries in the West . Yugoslavia . Italy and Greece are the leading customers for Albania 's oil , chemicals , mineral ores and agricultural products with Yugoslavia alone accounting for 19% of trade , valued at S115 million in 1980 , compared with only $20 million in 1979 . Recently trade agreements also have been signed with the Netherlands . and West Germany has agreed to supply a nickelprocessing plant . And yet , diplomats note , these changes in foreign trade have n't been accompanied by similar changes in Albanian foreign policy . Yugoslavians still are n't allowed into the country and the border with Greece is believed to be mined . In the case of the new agreement with China . " I think it is strictly trade and nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Radio Free Europe 's Mr. Zanga.
