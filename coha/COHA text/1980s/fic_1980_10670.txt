THE ASCENTlast night before Martin 's departure for the city and internship , moved around the table between Jessie , Donald Meig and an aunt and uncle from New York . Only Mary and Martin were silent . He was ill at ease and his feet hurt . He had bought white shoes , an extravagance because they would be so seldom worn , but he could n't have come to dinner here without them . Clothes were insurance , a kind of statement that a person " belonged , " whatever that meant . Idiotic ! But that 's the way it was and always had been . " Costly thy apparel as thy purse can buy . " Shakespeare knew about people like Donald Meig . He knew everything about people . Mary was serving a salad from the bowl which had been put before her . The gauzy , cherry-colored sleeve had fallen away from her bare arm . She had the look of someone who had strayed by accident into that room and that house . Jessie was laughing ; she had a hearty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was really a pleasure to watch her ! It occurredto Martin that in these few weeks he had become accustomed to her , sitting with her summer shawl gathered in stiff , concealing folds , her rapid hands moving as she talked , her bright eyes observing everything . And recalling suddenly what she had said about her sister at that first meeting , he wondered what she might be guessing , what she knew . . . A sharp ache shot through Jessie for the young man in the cheap suit and the stiff , new shoes ; the earnest young man with the proud , quick face and the eyes looking so hungrily at  --  someone else ! Oh , if I had Fern 's body what I would do ! she thought . Soft , dreamingthing , she lives in fantasy . I would make sure of that young man . He 's worth a dozen of any others I 've seen . The way he looks at her over the top of the glass when he drinks , pretending not to ! Oh , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked , two of them standing in the bathroom . " Poor child , " they said . I looked around for the child before I knew the child was I.In the mirrored door , I saw myself , naked and pink . There were Fern and Fern 's friend , come to stay overnight . And I saw they were alike , and I the different one . How old was I ? Four ? Five ? The seamstress came to make my dresses with wide , embroidered collars . Berthas , they used to call them , and they were so pretty , ruffled or pleated for concealment . They did n't conceal . I took the hand-mirror , and twisting , I could see my back , could see how the cloth where the ruffles stopped was stretched over the sharp knife-blade of bone . I remember those long rides in the car and the doctors ' waiting roomsRANDOM WINDS 41where Mother read Heidi aloud while we waited . Heidi was a brave girl and I must be brave , too . Then the doctors came in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my back with cold fingers . There was much talk , and after that the long ride home . " Tired ? " Father would ask Mother , and she would answer , " No , I 'm all right . " At the best toy stores they stopped to buy new dolls . They never knew I did n't care that much about dolls . I had rows of them , stupidlookingthings with long yellow hair and patent leather shoes . I used to undress them , taking off their lace-edged panties and petticoats . Their backs were smooth and straight from their shoulders to their little round behinds . They looked like Fern . Once at school I stood with a circle of children dancing around me . I can hear them now : they 're laughing and pointing . " Jessie is a  --  " they chant , but I do n't remember the word . Do n't want to , perhaps ? I remember the teacher , with her indignant , trembling voice , coming at a run . The children flee and I walk inside with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so fierce and proud , but now at her gentle comfort , I sobbed on the teacher 's shoulder . She reached in the drawer and gave me her clean handkerchief . It smelled of eau de cologne . I can smell it still . Aunt Milly wants Fern and me to go to Europe with them this winter . They 'll stay at the Carlton in Nice . Me at the Carlton with Fern ! Tea-dancing . Steps leading down . You stand at the top of the flight , waiting to be seated . Eyes turn up to see who you are . And I shall be standing next to Fern . No ! Thank you . And thank you again . . . Mary stirred uncomfortably . If only Jessie would take that look off her face ! A moment ago she was laughing and now she looks thunderdark . Will I never grow used to her ? " Jessie 's handicapped , " they told me so seriously , long years ago . I must have been still a baby . I thought " handicapped " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day I noticed her back . " What is that ? Does it hurt ? " " No , " Mother said , " it hurts only in her mind . " I remember thinking that , if everybody looked like Jessie , then I would be the queer one and people would stare at me . " They do n't mean to stare , they do n't mean to be unkind , they 're only curious . But she will have that all her life , " people said . Yet she was always tougher than I. Peppery as she was , it was she who did the hitting . " You must never hit her back , never , " they said . " You 're so much stronger ! Suppose you were to hurt her ? To break a bone ? What then ? " 42 THE ASCENTAnd I could see her tumbling , shattered on the floor , like that Orientalvase which Uncle Drew had brought from China and which a maid had broken , bringing lamentation to the morning . I hit Jessie . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an egg rose on her forehead . Feet came running  --  Carrie , the cook , Mother , Father . I was stiff with fright . She wailed and they picked her up . Father whipped me , me , his favorite , as I knew even then . He was so proud of me ! His fierce voice , his fierce face were like an ogre 's . " Do n't you ever hit Jessie again ! Do n't you touch her ! Do you hear ? " Uncle Drew took me aside . He was the only one who felt sorry for me . I stood between his knees while he sat on the sofa , his hands on my shoulders . " You have n't hurt her , Fern . Everyone 's excited , but you have n't hurt her , Fern . Remember that . It 's only a bump and will go away in a day or two . " I did n't want to go away to school . I had friends here . And I did n't want to leave my dogs ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be better for her , they said . Mother said , " We ca n't send Jessie away to school and keep you here , can we ? " And Father said , " You will meet nicer girls in boarding school , any-way . " But the girls all came from New York or Boston or Montreal . It was all the same as having no friends at all . Now she does n't want to go to Europe this winter . If she does n't go , Father will want me to stay home , too . But I 'm going . No matter what , I 'm going . I shall be sorry to leave Martin . I might fall in love with him if I could know him a little longer . And still in a way it seems I 've always known him . Even his silence speaks to me . Is it possible that he loves me already ? But he 's going away tomorrow . . . But he will come back . It 's only a few months , after all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe . . . all the sparkle . . . I 've never been anywhere at all . I think Jessie has fallen in love with him , though . I 'm sorry if she has . I hope she has n't . Life is very , very harsh . . . " It will be such joy having you with us , Fern , " Aunt Milly was saying and then , addressing Martin , " We 've invited Fern and Jessie to go to Europe with us , did you know ? We shall leave just after Labor Day and spend the winter . I do wish , Jessie , you would change your mind and come along , too . " Jessie shook her head . RANDOM WINDS 43 " It would do you the world of good , you know . Take you out of yourself . You really do need  --  " " I really do need a new spine , " Jessie said , and laughed . Aunt Milly blushed . " Oh , Jessie , I only meant  --  " " I know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Nice is wonderful in the winter , very mild , " Uncle Drew observed . " You can always change your mind , Jessie . Up to the last minute . " The voices crossed the table in a neat little fugue . Aunt Millie said to Fern , " You 'll be seeing the great art of the world . It 'll help immensely in your career , you know . " " Career ! " The father was irritated . " Do n't , please , give her more grandiose ideas than she already has . It 's a pretty hobby and that 's all it is . " " Excuse me , but you 're hardly a judge , " Mary said . " And you think you can judge ? " " No , but there are other people in this world who can . " " Was that thunder I heard , by any chance ? " Uncle Drew asked , changing the subject .

" And Jessie come , too . " " I do n't want to , " Jessie said . Mr. Meig frowned . " It 's going to rain any minute . " " Rain wo n't hurt anyone , " Aunt Milly told him . " We 'll not go far , " Martin said . The town was closed for the night . Houses wore shut faces ; their windows were drooping eyelids . A horn blew somewhere , a forlorn , far call in the silence . They circled through dwindling streets from pavement to asphalt to dirt , and where the fields began , turned back , talking of this and that and of nothing in particular . " So you 'll be going away , " Martin said . " I 'll miss you , Mary . " The words were unforgivably banal . He wanted to say such beautiful , extravagant things : I 'm enchanted , I think of you all day . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family , the gloomy house , the gloomy father ? Perhaps , in another setting more private and free , or if he were a few years farther along and had something definite to giveThe smell of rain was in the air when they came to the gate , Eastward , the clouds were darkening with approaching storm , but in the west the afterglow still streaked the sky in lines of copper and rose and a yellow like the inside of a peach. 44 THE ASCENT " Oh look ! " Mary cried . " It sparkles ! Martin , look ! " But he was not looking at the sky . He was looking at her , standing there with her hand held to her throat and the wonder on her face . There was a pain in his heart that he could n't have believed possible . At the front door they stood cramped between overgrown laurels . And quite suddenly the rain came , spattering on the leaves . " Well , " he said . " I guess I 'd better start . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He had meant only to kiss her good-bye . But when he had caught her to him , he was unable to let her go . How long he would have held her there he did n't know , but someone stirred in the vestibule as if to open the door . So she turned quickly into the house and he went clattering down the steps into the rain . Chapter5This was the way of it : He was Dr. Farrell , intern , responsible for lives . Agitated relatives waylaid him and the squawk-box pursued him . His irrevocablesignature went on every record . Pray it was n't written as witnessto a mistake he 'd made ! Best not to think about that , though ; just step forward and begin , the way a child learns to walk . The emergency room stayed in motion all night . One lived on black coffee . He slept on a cot or dozed off , rather , for a few minutes until a nurse came to shake him awake again . The doors would swing open , and another stretcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights were filled with sighs . Unbearable pain was unbearable to watch . He dreaded the terminal cancer patient most of all ; the breakdown of personality in even the most stalwart was terrible . He had not known that desperate people , even the very old , call out for their mothers . At times he thought he felt the weight of the pain-filled building , ten stories high , lying on his shoulders . " What 's different about you ? " Tom asked . " I do n't know . What is ? " " You 're only half here . Is there some trouble with your father or something ? " Martin had often said his father worked too hard and his blood pressure was too high . " No , no , I 'm just a little tense , I guess . " There was no one in the world whom he could trust more than this46 THE ASCENTfriend who was searching him now with inquiring eyes , but he could n't , he did n't want to , talk about Mary . If only his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If only the work were all he had to think about ! But he trembled inwardly : trembledat seeing the name of the Meig plant in the weekly paper , forwardedfrom home ; trembled at seeing a patient named Fern , a fat woman with a brogue and abscessed tonsils . He trembled when the mail came . She sent a card from Lake Champlain : Visiting here for a few days . Love . He read it over and over , studying the shapes of the words . She wrote in backhand . He wondered what that meant , whether it said anything about her personality . Then a card came that had a picture of an ocean liner . It had been mailed from Cherbourg . He imagined her walking in the rain on a cobbled street . He ached for her . It was a definite physical ache in the chest . One could understand why the ancients had believed that the heart was the seat of the emotions . His own emotions came close to the surface . He broke off with Harriet , in a scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made angry . His desire for her , for anyone but Mary , had drained away , as if a sluice had been opened . A tragedy took place in the hospital when one of the nurses killed herself . She had been going with Dan Ritchie , resident in orthopedics ; he had promised to marry her , then changed his mind . The horror of this shook Martin deeply . How the suffering must have cut to make a human being want to die ! But he thought he could understand it . He felt that he had grown enormously in understanding . And he was thankful for being overworked . It was the only way he would get through the winter . What he saw first on the stretcher was a young girl in a tight pink sweater and skirt . It crossed his mind that she looked like a girl who would be named " Donna " or " Dawn . " And on a necklace of cheap beads her name was spelled out : Donna . She had been run over in the rain . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have flung out to save herself , had been crushed . Standard procedure , he thought , accustomed as he was by now to quick judgment and quick action . Neurosurgery later to save the ulnar nerves . Useless hands , otherwise .

Where to find a surgeon Saturday night ? ComRANDOMWINDS 47mon sense . Trick is : very , very small stitches . Careful . Careful . Suture . Tie . Knot . Cut . Again . Suture . Tie . Knot . Cut . When he was finished , the pathetic face was crisscrossed with black silk and he was sweating . He leaned down . " Donna ? I 'm all through . " She was , mercifully , half asleep . " Will my face be all right ? " " Yes , " he said confidently . The mouth , large and cherry-colored , quivered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I promise . " " Will I be a cripple , Doctor ? " " Of course not , " he said . And forgive me for the lie because I really do n't know . They had cut the pink sweater off . Somebody began to cut the necklace . " No , " Martin said . " Do n't do that . " And he pulled the clasp toward the front to unfasten the beads . They would be precious to Donna . After she had been wheeled upstairs he kept thinking of her , and the next morning was still thinking of her . Mentally , as was his habit , he constructed her life . She lived in a walk-up and worked in the five-andten . For lunch she ate a tuna fish sandwich and a chocolate soda . She stood in line at the funerals of movie stars , chewing gum in wads . He felt an indescribable sadness . Some patients did that to him . What would become of her with paralyzed hands ? Dr. Albeniz was to operate in the forenoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors were back in the locker room . " It was very close , " Albeniz said , replying to Martin 's question . " But I 'm fairly sure she 'll be all right . " He seemed surprised . " Why , do you know the girl ? " " No . I was on duty when she came in . I sutured her face . " " You did ? " There was strong emphasis on the " you . " Martin felt quick dread in the pit of the stomach . " I 'm afraid I 'm the culprit . " " Culprit ? " Albeniz , who was tying his shoes , glanced up . " On the contrary , I asked because it 's a superb job . By the looks of it she will have scarcely a scar . " Martin swallowed , disbelieving . " I guess I was just lucky then . " " You had your nerve , knowing nothing about itI " " Yes , sir . " " You have good hands . Are you interested in plastic surgery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " No , I 'm not . " " Well , it was a superb job , " Albeniz repeated. 48 THE ASCENTMartin flushed , both with pleasure and misgiving . What had he dared to do , knowing so little ? He had just been awfully lucky ! Very generous , though , of Albeniz to say what he had . A week or two later , Albeniz ran past him in a corridor . Speed was his eccentricity . It seemed that all the greats had some eccentricity or other ! Jeffers wore rubbers even when the sun was shining . Albeniz never took the elevator , preferring in his haste to run up three flights of stairs . When he saw Martin he stopped . " Would you like to know how your patient is getting on ? " " Oh , yes , " Martin said , pleased at being treated like a colleague . " Well , for a while I had my doubts , but she will definitely have usablehands . Also a presentable face , thanks to you . " It seemed necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've done for her , my suturing seems unimportant . " " Not so . It 's not very good for one 's mental health to have scarred cheeks , you know . " " But your work is vital . I 've seen you work and I 've been  --  I guess you could say I 've been thrilled each time . " Albeniz smiled . " Well then , I give you a standing invitation to come and watch whenever you 're free . " The operating room was fitted out in porcelain and stainless steel , gleaming silver-gray . Beyond the great window , the winter sky was a darker gray . Albeniz and his resident , the anaesthesiologist , the nurses , the assistants and the subassistants moved quickly in an ordered pattern , their feet making no sound . It was a subaqueous ballet , a serious dance around the table on which the patient lay , his shaven head firmly clamped . The green curtain hanging on its frame separated his head from the rest of his body . A profusion of tubes was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't understand them it appeared to be only a tangle of tubes . But they were the weapons of this little army which was fighting for the life of the man on the table . The excitement was unlike anything Martin had ever felt before . He stood with the explorers , with Balboa sighting the Pacific Ocean and Magellan rounding the world . Bare and exposed lay a human brain . Albeniz looked up from it to the X-ray , hanging directly in his line of vision . There the arteries turned and curved like grapevines or Virginia creeper . There lay the dark blot and clump of tumor . Martin 's heart pounded . He tried to remember what he had learned about the brain ; neurons , axons , dendrites  --  andcould only think : There somewhere in that roughly corrugatedmass , that lump made of the same stuff as stomach or liver , ranRANDOM WINDS 49the electricity of thought . Out of it came words , music and commands to clench a fist or kiss beloved lips . " Clamp , " said Albeniz . His hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moved among those billions of neurons . " Cautery , " he said . " Suction . " Five and a half hours later it was over . Albeniz looked up . His eyes , above the mask , were weary . " I think I got it all out . " Martin knew he probably had , but no surgeon would ever say , " I know I have . " He was awestruck . A fine surgeon is an artist , thought Martin . All eyes are on him . He may be a simple , modest man like Albeniz or a bully like some others I 've seen . But either way he is respected : he has a great gift . What I should wish is to be like Dr. Albeniz . What am I dreaming of ? In such limited free time as he had , Martin observed Dr. Albeniz . He went to his laboratory and to his clinic . With curiosity and fascination he followed some cases through surgery and into ultimate rehabilitation  --  or else to postmortem . He asked questions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going in for neurosurgery ? That why you 've been hanging around Albeniz ? " Not very likely ! Who could afford to go in for graduate work ? Only very special people , types who could drift through Europe from clinic to clinic , spending a half year here and a half year there with the great authorities of Germany or England , steeping themselves , acquiring knowledge and finally , a name . For that sort of thing you needed independentmeans . Certainly you needed time . Probably too you needed a mentor to foster and advise . He was about to go off duty one afternoon when he was summoned to Dr. Albeniz 's laboratory . Perplexed by the summons , he went at once . The doctor was hanging up his lab coat . " I was wondering whether you like Italian food . There 's a place just a few blocks down Third Avenue . " " I 've never had any , " Martin said . " Good ! It 'll be a new experience , and everybody likes Italian food , even Spaniards like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " In case you 're wonderingabout this occasion , it 's just because I like to talk to the rising medical generation now and then . " 50 THE ASCENT " It 's very good of you , sir . " Martin hoped he did n't appear as awkwardas he felt . When they were seated with a clean , darned cloth and a basket of bread between them , Albeniz asked , " Would you like me to order for you ? " " Please do . " " All right then . Clams oreganata to begin . Pasta , of course . Salad . Do you like veal ? Veal pizzaiola , then . Is n't it ridiculous to eat like this without wine ? A fine , dry wine with the sunshine in it ? You Americans are such Puritans with your Prohibition . " He sighed , rubbing his hands to warm them and was silent a moment . He took off his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose . " You know , I 've been watching you watch me these last months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes , I  --  " Martin began , but Albeniz interrupted him . " Tell me why you wanted to be a doctor . " Martin said slowly , " It always seemed , as far back as I can remember , the most exciting thing I could imagine . " " Yes ? " " And I was curious . It 's like solving puzzles . You want to go to the next one . " He stopped , feeling the inadequacy of his explanation . But the other man smiled . " I 'm glad you did n't say to help humanity , ' or because I love people . ' Some such rubbish . I hear young men say that and I do n't believe them . " Martin was silent . " Of course you rejoice when you 've done something good for anotherhuman being ! And of course you feel pity when things go wrong ! But if you feel too much pity , you break your heart . Or you go crazy . " He waved an admonishing finger . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as you just said . Then , when the mind is beautifully clear and very cool , then you can really do some good . Sometimes . You understand me ? " " I think so . " The clams were brought . Albeniz took a mouthful , then laid the fork down . " We know so little . Take my field . It 's only for the last thirty years or so that we 've dared to go very far into the brain . Neurosurgery is a new discipline and most of what we know we 've learned since the war . " He paused , picked up the fork and put it down again . " Although , taking another point of view , it 's very old . Ancient , in fact . The Egyptians trephined the skull four thousand years ago , using sharpened stones . " With a clean fork , he pressed a diagram into the tablecloth .

" Medicine knows no politics , or should n't . But that early work was crude . There were too many infections . We 've come a good way since then . " " I see that .

" " Well , it 's just been decided . Of course , that will be only a start . What we ought to have , what I dream of , is an institute where neurosurgeryand neurology could be combined . Then we could truly study the whole brain : its function , pathology , even the tie-in with what is called mental illness , ' which has , I 've long been convinced , a physical cause . Perhaps God knows how many physical causes . " He sighed . " But , as I say , that 's only my dream . I have n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm no good at medical politics .

I detest these fellows who go on rounds and wisely nod their heads , pretending to know , when they have n't the slightest idea what it 's all about . How do you like the veal ? " " Oh , great ! Some change from the cafeteria ! " " I should hope so . Tell me , what are you planning to do when you finish in June ? " " Work with my father . He 's got a general practice upstate .

You finished your internship ; then you went into practice , and if you had one already waiting for you , why then , you were just very , very lucky indeed ! So he waited a moment and then , for the first time , expressedthe truth . " No sir , I do n't think I am . " " I see . " " I guess I have n't wanted to admit it , even to myself . " He turned away , looking at an amateurish painting of Italy , candypinkroses against a white wall and a gaudy blue sky. 52 THE ASCENT " Have some more pasta . You 're thin enough to afford it .

" Martin was halfway back to his room before he realized that Albeniz had n't even waited for his acceptance . He had simply taken for granted that no young man could do anything other than accept . And of course , he had been right ! There was such a beating and fluttering in his chest that he could n't shut himself indoors just yet ; he had to move , to walk . He went rapidly across town .

He felt like shouting out his glory . Remembering his father , he pushed the thought away , knowing that he54 THE ASCENTwould handle things somehow because , as Dr. Albeniz had said , there 's always a way . Then he thought of Mary . She would be home soon and he would talk to her . How foolish of him not to have told her how he felt before she left ! Not that she had n't known ! He smiled to himself . Well , in another month he would put everything into words ; he 'd buy her a little ring ; the three years would n't be all that long to wait . Her father  --  there was another problem , of course , but not insurmountable , either . Donald Meig 's displeasure was hardly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk and began a letter . He thought of asking her then and there to marry him , but the words looked either too stark or too florid and he decided he 'd rather wait to speak them aloud and hear her answer . For the present he would only describe the marvel that had occurred tonight . When he had finished he stood for a while looking out of the window . The soft , cold air of February , faintly damp with the nearness of spring , washed over him . A light went on in the wing of private rooms across the street . An ambulance , its tires making a small sigh on the pavement , rounded the corner . He took a long breath and spoke to his empty little room . " I am going to be a great doctor . " It was half a declaration and half a wondering question . " I am going to be a great doctor . " By two o'clock in the afternoon of the following day everybody knew about Martin . He was the only intern in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was something to talk about , to be envious of or impressed by . Tom puzzled over it . " Oh , it 's a stupendous opportunity , " he admitted . " But I do n't know , Martin , it 's a depressing specialty . The patients are all strangers , people you 'll never see again . And most of them die , you know they do . " " But if we take that attitude , they always will . The idea is to keep them from dying , is n't it ? " " Well , I ca n't wait to get out on my own . Beats me how you can even think of another three years . " Tom and Florence were to be married in July and he was to set up practice in Teaneck , New Jersey , with three thousand dollars borrowed from their families . The early marriage Martin could understand and envy , but not the haste to leave the hospital . I love it here , he thought . For me it 's the heart of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such joy . Everything blossomed . He found himself singing as he moved around his room in the mornings . All the faces on the street were friendly . He wanted to walk up to people , grasp them by the buttonhole and shout at them : RANDOM WINDS 55Is n't it a wonderful life ? There 's so much you can do with it ! So much work , so much love  --  if only there were more time ! Yes , it 's so wonderful and there 'll never be enough time for it all ! Then one day he decided to tell Tom and Perry about Mary . Their good will , their good wishes for him brought the usual tears to his eyes and their usual jokes about those foolish tears of his ; they knew each other well ! Tom asked , " Have you told your father yet about Albeniz ? " " No , not yet . " " Well , what are you waiting for ? " " I 'm a coward , I guess . But I 'll do it when I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd had only a postcard since he had written his news . They had been moving about all over England ; she would write a real letter soon . In the meantime she wanted him to know that his news was wonderful . She was happy for him and proud . He stuck the card in the mirror above the dresser and read it over morning and night . At last there came a thick envelope , postmarked " London . " Cutting the lunch hour short , Martin went to his room , locked the door and sat down , enjoying his anticipation . His eyes sped over the pages " . . . Alex 's mother has been a friend of Aunt Milly and Uncle Drew 's for years . He 's a wonderful person . You would really like him ! His wife died when their baby was born , a beautiful little boy , Neddie . . . . The wedding will naturally be very small , but I do n't mind . Jessie and Father will come over for it , and we shall have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep country and yet not far from London . You can see sheep on the hills in back of the garden . . . . I know you will be surprised at the suddenness of all this . I am myself ! But I am so very , very happy . " He thought at first that she was talking about someone else who was going to be married , a friend or someone met on her travels . He read it again . Then he went to sit on the edge of the bed . He put his head in his hands and felt ill : giddy , as though he were going to vomit . You would like him , she dared to write ! Like him ! Martin groaned . For an instant he had a crazy sensation : he was imagining this , it was a nightmare and in a minute he would wake up . But no , there it was , three compact pages in her own backhand script . Why ? How ? Did n't she know what he felt for her ? Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he have been imagining that , also ? Chapter6-He slid the flivver into the shed . Dean , their old , brown , calloused horse , thrust his head out of the stall . He 'd outlived his usefulness and Pa was simply saving him from the glue factory . Hideous thought . Martin entered the stall and laid his head against the hard , rippling shoulder . Its living warmth gave comfort . He felt such loneliness ! With Alice married and gone , with his mother herself in need of strengthening , there was no one to talk to . And after all , what was there to talk about ? Should he talk about Mary ? No use in that . It was over and done with . Strange how chemistry worked , how the flow of man 's desiring could be extinguished by time and troubles as a fire is quenched . Talk about his father , the withered flesh , the tottering walk ? What is there to say about a life that 's running out ? Just running out , like this horse 's life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd lost his wits , standing here like this . And abruptly repelled by his own sadness , Martin straightened and went into the house . " Pa gone up to bed this early ? " he asked . " No , he had his supper and went to his desk in the office . " Jean loweredher voice . " It seems to help him , sitting there looking at old recordsand things . I suppose he feels he 's busy . Martin ? " Something in her tone made him look up . " Martin , I did n't know he 'd taken a new mortgageon the house , did you ? " " I ? No . He 's never talked business affairs with me . " " Well . The original mortgage had been paid off before you went to56 THE ASCENTOr had she measured him against this  --  this Alex and found him the lesser of the two ? Oh , Tom was the lucky one !

To assume that she would be there , waiting , ready whenever I was ready ! Instead of making sure , instead of saying , that last night on the front stepsHe went into the bathroom and was violently sick . Then he came back and sat for a while , staring at the wall . After a time he picked the letter off the floor and ripped it across , ripped it over and over , and flung the shreds back on the floor . His arms felt heavy . A great weight descended and he threw himself down on the bed . Someone pounded at the door . Martin opened his eyes into weak , departing sunlight . " Are you in there ? Open the door . Where 've you been ? " Tom cried . " Did n't you hear the squawk-box ? They 've been calling you for an hour ! " " I did n't hear . I do n't seem to be feeling well . " " Sit down . I have to talk to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Lincoln 's face . " What 's the matter ? " " First tell me what your trouble is . Are you really sick ? " " Yes . No . I 've had a kind of blow , that 's all . " Tom studied him . " Is it anything you want to tell me about ? " he asked softly . " Mary 's being married in England , " Martin said , looking at the floor . " I 'm sorry ! Oh Martin , I 'm so sorry ! " " I know you are . " " You do n't deserve it  --  " A fire engine clanged in the street below . When it had passed , the silencewas absolute . After a minute Tom spoke . " I have to hit you again , Martin . Have to hit you when you 're down . " Martin looked up . Distress furrowed Tom 's cheeks , furrowed and creased them . " What do you mean ? " " Your sister telephoned . When you did n't answer , they told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 58 THE ASCENThigh school . . . I do n't understand . " His mother 's lips trembled . " How could he have worked so hard all these years and we still have nothing ? It just seemed to go as fast as it came in . It 's not as if we 'd had any luxuries . Well , yes , we did buy the new parlor suite last year ; the old one was really a disgrace . And we put new linoleum down . But I would n't even have done that if I had known . " He did n't answer , there being nothing to say . She set his plate on the table , poured coffee and , attempting cheer , sighed , " Well , what 's done is done I guess . No use bemoaning it . " If there is anything pathetic , Martin thought , it is penury in old age , the specter of dependency . Old age must be hard enough without that . From the kitchen table he could see into the parlor , where above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his parents , taken fortuitously only a few months before Pa 's stroke . Alice had wanted it taken . Ma had resisted , but Alice had pressed . It was only because she was moving away , she had said . Privately she had told Martin of her feeling that something was going to happen . " You could n't have known Pa was going to have a stroke , " he had argued . And she had said no , she certainly had n't known that . She had simply felt that something might be going to happen and she wanted the photo before it was too late . So they stood for all time together in a gilded oval frame , the mother wearing a silk dress and a gold watch on a neck chain , the father in his dark good suit , looking , for him , unusually dapper and spruce . He would never look that way again . " You saw Ken Thompkins today ? " Ma inquired now . " Yes . He wo n't last the night . He 's been vomiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call till today . His wife thought it was colic . " Martin could hear the exasperation in his own voice . " My God , what pitiful ignorance ! I thought as a last hope we could rush him to Baker for surgery . I would 've driven him the seventymiles myself , but he would n't go . Says if he 's going to die , he wants to die at home . " And Martin threw out his hand in a gesture of hopelessness , tipping the coffee cup . His mother rose to wipe the spill and handed him two letters . " I forgot . Here 's mail for you . " Martin propped the letters against his water glass , reading over a lifted fork . Tom wrote that he had opened his office . He had got privilegesat a good hospital . Florence was keeping her job , and they were gradually furnishing the house . Martin must somehow get down to see them . The second letter was from Dr. Albeniz . He was holding Martin'sRANDOM WINDS 59place open . He understood the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things in order at home within the next few weeks . " Something wrong , Martin ? " " No . Tired , that 's all . " " I do n't know what we 'd do without you , " his mother said . " It would be disaster , plain and simple . Is n't it the hand of Providence , though , that if this had to happen to your father , it waited until you were finished and ready to take his place ? " She stood frowning a little , wipingand wiping the spot , now dry , where the spill had been . Then becoming aware of his gaze , she brightened . " Oh , I hear my raccoons at the trash ! They 're almost tame , coming for their bread every night . I used to be annoyed with them , but your father taught me  --  You remember your pet raccoon , Martin ? You were only about seven or eight when Pa found it along the road . Remember ? " He was not fooled by her brave prattle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said gently . " Martin , you mean well , but I 'd rather have the truth . I see him going downhill . Give me the truth : What 's going to happen ? " " Ma , I do n't know . I 'd tell you if I did . I 'd be surprised if he improvedany , but he could go on no worse than this for years . Or he could have another stroke or a coronary tonight . " Her eyes widened . " Oh , it is n't fair ! He was so good to everyone ! " The night-bell rings . Sleet clatters on the windowpane . Pa creaks down the stairs and out the door ; the motor coughs in the garage . The time is two-fifteen . . . " No , " Martin said , " it is n't fair . " ( Not if you believed in just rewards , which he did n't and his mother did . ) Presently the collies began barking in the yard , subsiding as they recognizeda familiar voice . " Sounds like Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I thought it was you ! Why , Charlie , what have you got there ? " Charlie Spears came in and set a carton of groceries on the floor . " Thought you might use some extras from the store outside of your regularorder . A few delicacies for Doc . Doc Senior , " this with a nod to Martin . " He was always partial to bananas , and here 's Scotch marmalade , herb tea , water biscuits and some of that there smelly foreign cheese . I never liked it myself , but then , there 's no accounting for taste , as they say . " Jean flushed . " Charlie , you 're too good to us . You should n't , really you should n't . We 're doing fine and  --  " Charlie looked up sharply . " ' Twas n't charity , Missus . ' T was because Doc was always real good to me and he 's a friend . " 66 THE ASCENT RANDOM WINDS 61When he had gone , Jean said , " People have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 've been so kind . It 's one of the rewards of this kind of life . So you see , it is n't all hardship , Martin . " " I know that , Ma , " Martin said firmly . There were shuffling steps in the hall , and his father appeared in the doorway . " Who was that ? " " Charlie Spears . He brought you a package of goodies . " Enoch glanced at the carton without interest . " I 'm bored , " he said petulantly . " Nothing to do here all day . " " You 'll just have to learn to kill time , " Jean told him , " until you get to be yourself again . " Enoch stared at her . " Kill time ! That 's the worst thing you could have said . It 's time that 's killing me . Well , I 'm going up to bed . Good night , folks . " He struggled slowly up the stairs . It was difficult because the bannisterwas on the right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once when he faltered , Martin rose to help , but his mother waved him back with a signal . " He does n't want to be helped . " And Martin knew that this understanding was born of thirty-four years of life together . So they sat , the wife and the son , not speaking , stirring the coffee in their cups . Chink . The spoon struck the cup , then ground around the sides again . Chink . Once more the collies barked , this time at the front of the house . Martin got up and went to look . There was nothing to be seen in all that darkness except the band of light that slid from the open door . Then his nose led him to the basket of apples , to the sharp , fresh scent of Greenings . " Martin , what is it ? " " Somebody 's left apples on the porch . There 's no name . That 's odd . " " Not odd . People do that lots of times when they ca n't pay and Pa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give whatever they can . No , leave them there . You can carry them to the root cellar in the morning . " She went back to the kitchen . He sat down on the porch step next to the apples , with a dog on eitherside . A fox barked from the woodlot across the road . Low on the horizon , just above the trees , Orion shone . You could n't be Pa 's son , he thought , without having learned something about the constellations . The sky looked lonely , the universe larger and more lonely than at other times and in other places . If he could hear some music , it would be a comfort , he thought , remembering the soaring voices and soaring strings . All the lights ! All the life ! Why could n't he just accept ? Alice had gone with Fred to live with his parents in Maine and she , a woman with no place of her own , was not complaining . Although , who knew how she really felt about it ? Her letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to talking much about his feelings , either . " You 're letting the cold air into the house . " Jean stood in the doorway . " I 'm going to bed . You coming up , too ? " Martin and the dogs went in . " Soon . I thought maybe I 'd go over some things in Pa 's desk . " " Oh , I wish you would ! If he had only let me take care of things ! I always wanted him to , but he did n't believe in a woman doing all that . I know the bankbooks are somewhere in the desk . I guess you can find them . " She hesitated . " I do n't want to bother him by asking how much money there is , as if I expected him to die . " Tears stood in her eyes , puddled there , but not overflowing . " So it would be a good idea if you 'd look things over . Only do n't stay up too late . You need your rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood came the recollection of his mother 's exasperated voice : " If you would just once let me straighten this mess up , Enoch ! " Under a pile of prescription blanks , old postcards , letters , calendars and samples of medicine in cardboard containers , lay a marriage certificate and birth certificates , Alice 's and Martin 's own . Also Enoch Junior 's , Susan 's and May 's . Why on earth had Pa kept those ? Here was the mortgage agreement , which should be in a safe deposit box in case of fire . Here was the disability policy , small at best , but invalid now at age sixty-five , just when you were most likely to need it . Martin swallowedoutrage . And here were three savings-bankbooks , tossed in the muddle . He opened them and added the sum . Four thousand , four hundredeighty-three dollars and seventy-six cents . He rummaged incredulouslyfor another book , but there was none . This was it . This was all Pa had , after a lifetime of labor . He sat in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four thousand dollars and this modest house , an upended box devoid of comfort or grace , that needed every kind of repair anyway . How often had he not heard the story , told with pride , of how this house had been acquired ? " I had my eye on it , at the crossroads , and only three and a half miles from Cyprus . The bank was glad to make the loan . I had a good reputation already , and I 'd only been in this country six years . " So then , this house and a basket of apples left by a grateful patient . And who would take care of them now , except their son ? It must have been hard for his mother . He remembered the time Pa62 THE ASCENThad dropped a hundred and twenty-five dollars . He 'd had the money stuffed in his pocket on his way to town to pay bills . " I even made you a leather purse , " his mother had mourned . " Why do n't you use it ? " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were the times he had actually given money to patients . " They had nothing , " he would say , and his mother 's lips would grow tight and thin , as though she were fastening them together with a pin . She 'd been afraid to speak , having never got over the honor of being married to him . If she had ever had regrets , she had not admitted them , probably not even to herself . True to her stern beliefs , she would accept without complaint whatever burden the Lord might see fit to lay upon her . For a long time Martin sat , then abruptly reached for a piece of paper and a pen . He could have poured out pages of his grievous disappointment , but nobody beside himself cared about that . Each man bore his grevious disappointments alone . So the pen slipped rapidly across a single sheet of paper . " Dear Dr. Albeniz , Thank you for waiting until I could reach a final decision . I appreciate your patience and your understanding . . . gratefuland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my family situation . . . regret . Very good wishes . " Short and sweet . He put his hands over his face . His sadness was so vast it emptied him . He was hollow , floating in chill gray sadness , in shreds of vapor , fog and whispers . Everything that had been so bright and pulsing had just quietly slipped away , fallen from his outstretched hands . Gone . All gone . A great wind rushed past the house . Wind of the world , carrying a hundred million hopes away . Not just mine . Remember that . And rolling the top down on the scattered papers in the desk , he went upstairs to sleep in the maple bed which had been his ever since he had outgrown a crib . The year hurried toward its close . The lakes froze ; a thin film of dimpled ice hardened and thickened . Among the neighbors Christmas preparations made a pleasant bustle as tins of peanut brittle and homemadefudge were carried from house to house . Pine sprays with red bows were hung on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Flexible Flyers . Christmas morning brought a sugary , fresh fall of snow . Shortly after six o'clock , Martin was called out . When he got back it was almost time for dinner . Pa looked up questioningly . " Anything important today ? Anything I ought to know ? " RANDOM WINDS 63 " I think I 've finally persuaded Mary Deitz to have the goiter operated on . " " She 's had that goiter fifteen years ! Cut , cut , that 's all you young fellows know how to do . " Pa was having one of his cranky days . " I 'm not the one who 's going to do it , more 's the pity . " " Hmph . You were telling me something the other day about something in the  --  the ventricle . . . I do n't remember . What was it again ? " " The ventriculogram , you mean ? " " Yes , that 's it . How does that work again ? " " Well , it 's  --  you remove the ventricular fluid and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can tell by X-ray where the air has moved within the brain . That 's putting it very simply , of course . " " Hmph . I dare say there 's good in a lot of this new stuff . But these fellows do n't know everything , Martin . Just because they fasten their names onto some high-sounding articles , do n't let them fool you . " " No , Pa . I wo n't let them fool me . " He looked so small and old , standing there . And also , in a dreadful way , he looked childish . " What 'll happen when you fellows have divided up the whole human body among yourselves , hey ? One 'll study the left ear , the other will study the right knee ! Why , there wo n't be a doctor among the lot of you fit to treat a whole patient ! " Pa had used to say , " You will see such marvels in your lifetime , Martin ! " But now illness and the hidden envy that can corrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his son 's heart ached . The Christmas table was set in the dining room which was on the chilly side of the house . Pa felt the cold . " I do n't know why we had to eat in here , " he complained . " I 'll put the electric heater near you , " Martin offered . " No , wait , I 'll get it , " Jean said . " You carve the turkey , Martin . " That had been his father 's job . All those years of Christmas and Thanksgiving turkeys , of Easter hams , eaten in this room ! It would be Martin 's job now , so he guessed he 'd better learn . Strip the leg off first , take apart at the joint , now cut the wing . Now slice neatly from the breast . " My , that 's expert , " his mother said heartily . " Enoch , will you say the grace ? " " Let Martin do it . " " For what we are about to receive , Father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed between the three of them . Pa 's plate was mounded with creamed onions , turkey , mashed turnip , mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce . He had not lost his enormous appetite . Silently , 64 THE ASCENT RANDOM WINDS 65voraciously he ate , gazing with abstracted eyes at the sideboard array of Jean 's best cut-glass bowls and her " good " dishes . " Those dishes were given to us when we were married , " Jean said suddenly . " And do you know , there 's only been one broken , and it was n't done by me . It was one of the neighbors helping clear the table . That 's why I never like anyone to help me . Even if they do n't break things , they chip them . " There was a silence . Martin tried to think of something to say . " I do wish Alice were here , " Jean remarked . He understood that the remark was partly an expression of a real wish and partly an effort to break the silence . He tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to visit before spring ? " " I should n't think so . The roads are awfully bad and the train connectionsare dreadful . She 'd have to travel all the way east to Boston , and then come west again . " " I imagine she 'll do it all the same , " Martin guessed . " Oh , she might at that . She 's a good daughter , Alice is . And I know she wants to see her father . Anybody like to try my mincemeat ? I brought two jars up from the cellar . It 's so good the next day with cold turkey . Enoch ! Enoch ! What is it ? " Pa 's hands clutched at his chest . " I do n't feel well . " He pushed his chair violently away from the table . " I have a terrible pain . Terrible ! " he cried , very loud . And while in an instant of dumb shock they stared at him , he stood up , stretched tall and reaching , stiffened , buckled at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table with a dreadful , tearing sound . Then the chair broke , splintering as Enoch and the chair both crashed to the floor . " Oh God ! " Jean screamed . " Oh God ! Enoch , get up ! Martin ! Enoch ! Get up ! " Her cry was to repeat itself in Martin 's ears for the rest of his life , and Christmas was to be marked with the memory of it forever . Enoch was laid out in the parlor between the two front windows . People came with proper grave faces , bending to the widow , who , her first spasms of weeping past , sat quietly acknowledging their hushed sympathy . They looked down at the dead man in his dark suit and his secret dignity : I have gone beyond your small concerns and I know what you can not know . They stood looking with embarrassment and fear . They walked , risen on the balls of their feet , and with the same grave , tragic faces , left the room . They stood in knots on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hailing one another , greeting briskly . " Want a lift home , George ? " " Say , when 'd you get the new car ? " Alone in the evening , Martin went back into the room . It was not his father 's face that moved him most , it was his hands . Was n't that strange ? Yes , his hands , folded on the chest where the undertaker had arranged them , waxy and larger than life . Were they really that large or was it because of something the undertaker had done ? Hands , that marvelous circuitry of brain to hand that can curve to catch a ball , clench to a smashing fist , or open to touch with gentle palm . Marvelous , marvelous . My father 's hands . And somewhere out of his most cursory readings in psychiatry , Martinremembered : Was it Freud who said that the greatest blow to a man is the death of his father ? All the knotted , complicated web of memories , resentments , comfort and confidence , humor and wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and that I shall carry through my years lies here . You try to make some order out of it , and there is none . It ends in this . My father , you 've gone so far away . I think that if I talk loud enough , surely you will hear me . I ca n't understand why it is that you ca n't hear . You lie there , but you 've gone . Everything 's stopped in you . It terrifies me , this death of yours . I 've seen death so often by now , but not your death . There are things I would like to have talked to you about when you were yourself and well . In so many ways Ma has been the head of the household , for somebody had to try to manage things . But you were always the heart . You were the heart . In the pile of letters that arrived during that next week , there came a note from Jessie Meig . " Father and I were so sorry to learn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-fashioned man . He will be missed . If you ever have time , would you come to visit us ? Would the Sunday after next for tea at four be all right ? " He whipped the letter against the table 's edge . Be damned if he would walk into that house again ! What did they think of him , for God 's sake ? Why should he want to visit there ? A small fury surged in his chest , and then receded . Very likely they were n't thinking anything . Then he felt foolish . He looked at the letter again , at the blunt black strokes : an unusual script , individual and strong , rather like Jessie herself . He wondered what life was like for her now in that house with her sister gone . Not that they had been that warm toward one another ! Still , a sister was a sister . He was tempted to accept . Admittedly and not unnaturally , he66 THE ASCENTwas a little curious . Why not ? But on second thought , he decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks later his mother reported , " Jessie Meig telephoned today . She wondered whether you had got her note . " He was ashamed of his rudeness . Perhaps he had been more than rude ? Perhaps even terribly unkind , rejecting the well-meaning , outstretchedhand ? Then he had a mental picture of Jessie , seated in the enormous wing-chair , almost curled within it , as though she felt protected by the wings . He had forgotten how small she was , and he thought : Out of pure decency , I ought to go . So , on the following Sunday afternoon he strode up the walk between the iron deer , stood under thawing icicles on the porch and entered the house he had never expected to enter again . Chapter7  --  Jessie put the remainder of the lunch into a bag and capped the thermos . " Do you want to drive , Martin , or shall I ? " " It 's your car . You drive . " Summer had barely peaked and already the first small signs of its wane were beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick along the roadside . Queen Anne 's lace stood stiff and starched in the fields . Ever since winter 's end , Jessie had been going along with Martin on his far-country house calls . He was n't quite sure how the habit had been formed ; he thought vaguely that it might have been her father who had suggested it . At any rate , that negative , inhibiting person had been surprisinglycordial during these past months . " It 'll do you good to get out more , " he had said . Certainly that was true . Jessie 's need for companionship was visible enough . Martin understood , because the same need was in him . He missed good talk , that quick comprehension which comes when the associationsand the bent of mind are kin . Most of his boyhood friends had dispersed ; those still here at home were married and there was no place for Martin in their households . After five close years , he felt the loss of men like Tom and Perry . It seemed sometimes that in all of Cyprus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jessie Meig . The father went upstairs in the evenings now , leaving the library to them . Martin had come to take his place opposite Jessie at the chessboard . She usually beat him ! There was music on the radio ; there was pleasant comfort. 68 THE ASCENT " You 're worried about something again , " she said , taking the wheel . " I can always tell . " " I am . It 's that place we stopped at before lunch . I 'm still feeling sort of sick about it . " " The woman with the cough ? " " Cough and nausea . She 's lost sixteen pounds in the last two months . I know it 's a malignancy . I 'm so sure I 'd take a bet on it . " He shook his head in recollection of the dreary young woman with the delicate face . " I told them she needs to go to the hospital for tests . I was as emphatic as I could be without using the word cancer . ' I said she must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept saying , She 's just weak after birthing and she 'll be all right . ' He assured me ! And anyway , the hospitalwas out of the question . Who would take care of the kids ? Then he followed me outside and told me he 'd be careful , he knew she 'd had too many kids too fast . She was n't strong like some women . He 'd see she had no more . Oh , she 'll have no more ! " Martin said grimly . " She wo n't be alive nine months from now . " " Trouble started in the ovaries , I suppose . " " Why , yes , I 've a pretty good idea it did . But how do you know ? Were you guessing ? " " You told me something once about another case that sounded like this one . I would never want to be a doctor , but still I do like to listen to you and I do remember things . " " And I  --  if I could n't have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have wanted to be . " Around a bend , they were slowed almost to a stop by a wagon with an enormous load of hay . From the top of the pile a woman called cheerfully , " Hi , Doc ! " " That 's good fodder you 've got there , " Martin called back . " Yes , and we 'll be needing it before you know it . The older I get , the shorter the summers get . " " Just do n't throw that back out again unloading ! " " They like you , Martin , " Jessie said when they drove on . " I like them . " In his few short months of practice he had been touched a dozen times with powerful emotion and the emotion of power . In their houses , in the beds where the fevered lay with brilliant eyes , they turned to him in trust . Touching their sick flesh , he could feel their engulfing gratitude and admiration . Something swelled in a man then : might one call it a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not , that what he did was often not enough and should be better . " Most illness is self-limiting , " he mused aloud now . " Fluids , bedrestRANDOM WINDS 69and warmth will cure most ailments in a matter of days . But what bothers me , Jessie , is the other kind . This morning 's case , for instance . I 'm stymied , battling distance and lack of facilities and ignorance . The patients ' ignorance and my own . Mostly my own . " And he repeated his thoughts aloud , " What I do could be done so much better ! " " I 'm sure it could , " Jessie said . On those infrequent times when he had expressed such doubts to his mother , her standard , uncomprehending reply had always been : " Oh , you belittle yourself , Martin . " " It must be marvelous to know and do ! " Jessie cried vehemently . " To be your own person ! Why do people think women do n't want that too ? They think you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does , the same freedom to stretch your thoughts and learn things . You know , if I were whole , I would defy all that and try it anyway . Some women do and always have . George Sand , for instance . I 've read her novels and they are n't very good , but that 's not the point . She was a free woman . That 's the point . " Her hands were tense on the wheel . And she finished furiously , " As for me , every thought I have , every breath I take , is influenced by this damned hump . " Martin tried to change the subject . " The next place we come to used to be the Brook farm . My father would tell me every time we passed it how , back in the nineties , when he made calls in a buggy , they had a big mean dog that would lie in the tall grass beside the road and jump out at the horse . One time it made Pa 's horse bolt , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm . " They passed the Brook farm without event . Silage corn was tall in the fields and cattle chewed dreamily in pasture-shade . A man , recognizing Martin , waved a paintbrush from a ladder propped against the Grecian pediment of his house , on which the facade of the Parthenon or the temple at Sounion had been reproduced in native wood . Pa , the classics student , had never failed to remark on things like that or on the names of New York State towns : Ithaca , Syracuse , Rome . And Martin 's thoughts drifted on with his father . " Pa used to carry a wire-fence cutter with him on winter calls . The roads got snowed over so often , he 'd be driving through fields without knowing it . He used to fold a newspaper under his vest to keep warm . Sounds like a hundred years ago , does n't it ? But it was n't so long ago , really . Say , does n't that look tempting ? " In Gregory 's Pond , the confluence of three streams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't we bring our suits sometime ? " he proposed . " Oh , I forgot , you do n't like to swim . " 70 THE ASCENT " That 's not true . I really do like to . " " But you said  --  " " I only said so because I did n't want you to see me in a bathing suit . Now all of a sudden , I would n't mind . Maybe because you 're a doctor . But I would n't be ashamed anymore . " " Jessie , there 's nothing to be ashamed of ! " " Well , not ashamed exactly . It 's that I think people will find it  --  disgusting , " she said , so low that he barely caught the word . " Nihil humanum mihi alienum est . ' You said you remembered your Latin , did n't you ? " " Nothing human is alien to me , " she said quietly , and after a moment , " Thank you . " " You ought to put a higher valuation on yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But then , so should you . " " What do you mean ? " " You ought to be doing what you want to do . Something more important than what you 're doing . " " But what I 'm doing is important . These sick people are important . " " Of course they are ! But you 're one of the movers , the advanceguard , Martin . Listen ! There are people who sing in the chorus , and weneed them . Then there 's the tenor lead , and we need him most of all . " " Maybe you overestimate me . " " Oh , I despise false modesty ! What 's that magazine sticking out of your bag ? You 've had it there since last week . " " This ? " He drew out a copy of Brain . In a moment of high hopes he had taken a subscription to it . " Oh . There 's a fascinating article this month about an operation for the removal of the frontal lobe . I 'll lend it to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder what a person is like after that ? " " From what I 've read they 're recognizably normal . ' They do lose some  --  mental energy , I guess you could call it  --  desire to figure out new undertakings , and so on . But I guess that 's better than the alternative . " " Incredible ! The whole business is , delving inside the brain . " " Yes . I used to watch Dr. Albeniz operate  --  It seemed almost magicalto me . " " Is n't he the one who wanted you to train with him ? " " Yes . " " It 's been horrible for you to give it up , has n't it ? " " Well , not easy . " He would have to stop thinking about it , learn to accept reality and cultivate patience . He 'd never had much patience and that was another flaw in him . RANDOM WINDS 71 " I 'm sorry I brought it up just now , " Jessie said soberly . " That 's all right .

But I 've told you , I 'm queer that way . I can sense hidden things in people . " Astonishing girl ! For it was true . Melancholy , sticky and gray as cobwebs , had been clinging to him . " There 's something I 've been wanting to say to you , Martin . I have n't done it because you 're so reserved and I  --  " " Reserved ? Is that how you see me ? " " Of course . Do n't you even know that about yourself ? What I wanted to say is : I hope you have no thought that I 'm running after you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Most people would n't agree , I suppose , but I always think that men and women can be good friends . So I just wanted to set you straight , in case you might be thinking I was fool enough to think otherwise . These last months have been wonderful for me . You understand ? " " I understand . " The little car spun along . Jessie 's keen face frowned at the road . Then she turned back to Martin . " I 've been wanting to ask you something else too . Were you terribly in love with Fern ? " Ah , but this was too much ! " In love with her ? " he answered curtly . " I scarcely knew her ! " " There 's no reason to be angry . " " I 'm not angry ! " " Offended , then . It was a natural question , was n't it ? Why all this socalledtact ' and secrecy ? " No matter how blunt or shocking , this outrageous girl would say it ! Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know I am ; my pride will be my downfall . Then Jessie said more softly , " I 'm sorry . I went too far just now . It 's none of my business , after all . " " But what made you think  --  " " What made me ? Because Fern is  --  Fern . If I had n't had my own72 THE ASCENT RANDOM WINDS 73problems , I would have loved her myself . " Jessie sighed . " As it is , I 've almost hated her . I was rotten to her when we were children . . . Once I bloodied her nose , then when she hit me back they punished her , even though I 'd started it . I have some mean memories , I can tell you . " He began vaguely , " Well , children  --  " " Of course , " she interrupted , " it 's not bloody noses anymore . It 's just feelings . As if she could help the way she is anymore than I can help the way I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sick with it . " He did n't want to listen . And he wondered whether this girl would be stripping herself before him if he had n't been a doctor . People seemed to think that if you were a doctor you would welcome every possible confession . " I 've begrudged her very existence . Even her name , I 've begrudged her that , too . " " Her name ? " " Yes . It sounds so cool and full of grace . Mary Fern . " I 'm lovely , ' it says . Mary Fern . ' While I , I 'm Jessie Gertrude . ' It 's a **26;7695;TOOLONG . As if they took one look at me when I was born and gave me a name ugly enough to suit . " Jessie shifted gears to climb a hill . Then she said , " Fern 's the total sentimentalist , you know . " Martin did n't answer . Below them the valley spread its wide , green peace . Jessie was spoiling the afternoon . " Mother worried so about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than destroy her idea of perfection . For instance , she would never get a divorce and come home if she were to make a bad marriage . That would be an admission of defeat . Did I tell you she 's pregnant ? " " No . " " They did n't lose any time , did they ? But I 'm glad for her , I really am . Alex is awfully nice ; they 've a marvelous house and a flat in Londonand he 's really giving her encouragement with the art thing , for whatever it 's worth . It should be a very good life for her at last , not having me to keep her from going places . " " Do n't dwell on that , Jessie . Things probably were n't nearly as bad as you 're making them . " " Yes , they were . . . You know , I 've never told these things to anyonebefore . Do you think I 'm a rotten , nasty person , Martin ? " " Of course I do n't . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside me , want everything to be good for Fern . Do you believe me ? " " I believe you and I think you 're wonderful , " he said gently . " Evenwith that sharp tongue of yours . " He smiled . " You 're perceptive and honest . I 'm glad I know you . " She answered with untypical shyness , " Are you ? Then I 'm glad , too , because it 's the same for me . " The second winter began . Still winters of the north ! A branch cracks , snow sifts and falls sighing to the ground . For five months the ground is white and the spruce-covered hills are black . In the morning before you see it , you can smell the fresh snow that has fallen during the night . You hear the ringing silences of evening . Martin 's mother said suddenly , " You ought to be married . " A flush spread up her cheeks . She must have been thinking the words ever since they had left the supper table and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no girl around that I want to marry . " " You have n't tried to find one , have you ? All you ever do is work or go to play chess with that Jessie Meig . It 's no life for a young man . " The telephone rang and Martin went to answer it . " Hello ? " " This is Donald Meig . I was thinking maybe you could run over tonight . Can you ? There 's something I 'd like to talk to you about . " " Yes , surely , I 'll be right over , " Martin said , with some surprise . Half an hour later he was in the familiar library . " Excuse us , Jessie , will you ? " Meig said . " I 've a medical matter to discuss with Martin . " He closed the double doors firmly . " Have a brandy . It 'll warm you . You 're wondering why I called you . " Meig sighed , and Martin waited . " You have problems . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes . But I 'd like to talk about yours first . I know you 're not satisfied with your life here . " Martin felt ashamed . Jessie must have talked , making him look like some sorry malcontent . So he defended himself . " I feel I 've been doing a fairly good job , learning practical things that I needed to know . " Meig waved him aside . " Nonsense ! Platitudes ! You 're not the averagerun-of-the-mill country doctor , and we both know it . So let 's get to the heart of the matter . You 've had some spectacular offers . " " One offer . " " All right . One spectacular offer . Jessie tells me it was the opportunityof a lifetime , and you 've had to pass it up . Is that true ? " " True . " " A damn shame ! The door opened to the future and then shut in your face for want of a few dollars ! " " A great many dollars , I 'm afraid . " 74 THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one man is pennies to the next . And compared with what you might earn if you could have this training , it actually is only a few dollars . " Surely the man was n't offering to lend him money ? Martin felt a peculiardistaste . " It 's not because of the dollars , however many , that I would have taken the training , " he protested . " I 'm aware of that , " the other man said shortly . " You 've heard of Hugh Braidburn in London , the neurosurgeon ? " That was almost like asking whether one had heard of Darwin or Einstein ! " Of course . He 's coauthor of the textbook . Cox-Braidburn . " " Well , I 'm acquainted with him . His father-in-law was the head of our plant in Birmingham . We sold the plant about ten years back , but the contacts are still there . As a matter of fact , Braidburn had dinner with us on his last trip over just before my wife died . " Meig sipped the brandy thoughtfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I could get any favor I asked him for . " On a table behind the sofa stood a photograph that Martin had never seen before . Framed in silver , Mary held an armful of calla lilies , a lace veil swirling to her feet . He tried to decipher her expression but could see only the calm , reflective smile of the traditional bridal picture . " I said , " Meig demanded , " what do you think of the idea ? " " Excuse me . I was n't  --  I did n't quite understand . " " Good God , man , pay attention ! I asked you how you 'd like to spend a couple of years in London , studying with Braidburn . " What sort of a charade was this ? To study with Braidburn ? Why , even Dr. Albeniz would be awed at the thought of it ! " Like it , Mr. Meig ? It would be  --  it would be paradise ! But it 's im-possible ! " Meig laughed . It struck Martin that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever seen his teeth . " It 's not impossible at all . I told you I could get any favor I asked him for . " Yes , yes , Martin thought , I suppose people like these always do know somebody who will do them a favor . It 's a chain , a network all over the world . If I had a voice and wanted to study for the opera , he 'd know the best voice teacher in Italy , one who did n't take any more pupils , but who would take me . And he became aware that his heart was beating very fast . Meig leaned forward now , lowering his voice . " Of course , I ca n't expect you to understand without giving you the whole story . So now let 's go to my problem . I have angina . " RANDOM WINDS 75 " I 'm sorry . I did n't know . " " Nobody does . I go to a doctor in Albany because I do n't want anyonearound here to find out . Most especially not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you 'll excuse me , do you think that 's wise ? If anything were to happen to you , it would be harder for her not to have been prepared , and Jessie is nothing if not a realist . " " You know her rather well , then . " " We 've had a lot of talks this past summer and fall . I can tell you I think she can cope with things far better than most of us . " " She 's a bright girl . Both my girls are . They 're like their mother . Soft , too . Especially Fern . Curious about everything . Music . Pictures . Books . Jessie 's got all that but not as soft . She 's got a little of me in her . " Jessie would be amused to hear that . " Father 's a Babbitt , " she 'd told Martin once , not unkindly . " He calls Uncle Drew arty ' because he collects books , although he does make allowances since Uncle Drew is rich , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall above Martin 's head . " Damned injustice ! My wife never drew a happy breath after Jessie was born . " He looked back at Martin . " It 's been hard , all around , very hard . We were n't always fair to Fern , either , I suppose , keeping her away from lively places where young people meet each other . But we were always torn between her and what was best for Jessie . " Martin moved restlessly . All of a sudden , it seemed to suit this cool and haughty man to confide in him ! All of a sudden , and why ? And what did it have to do with neurosurgery in London ? " Now let me tie all this together . I have angina , I have a daughter who will be alone in the world on the day I die . Fern has a life of her own now in England , and there are a couple of relatives in New York who also have their own lives . So what 's to become of Jessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Martin was silent . " When I 'm gone and she 's lonely , some clever operator will think she has millions , which she has n't , and he 'll marry her . After a while he 'll leave her . Oh , there 's little you can tell me about the world ! I 've seen it all . " Meig stood up , poured more brandy and sat down again . " If I could only see her well and wisely married before I die  --  Marriage used to be , and in Europe among some groups even today , still is , a family contract . It 's a sound , planned arrangement involving friendship and mutual interests . And that 's not bad as a foundation , when you consider it carefully . " 76 THE ASCENTWas it possible he was going to say what Martin thought he might be going to say ? " Well . I 've turned this over and over in my mind for a hundred hours , and I want to make an honest proposition . " Meig took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth drop open . " I 'll see to it that you get the best medical training in the world . I 'll subsidize you until you can support yourself . And I 'll give you enough to maintain your mother . She wo n't have to know it comes from me . She can think you 're getting paid over there and it 'll save her pride . I understand all about pride , you see . Yes , marry Jessie , and make a life for yourself . " One could n't just get up and stalk out of a man 's house . One could n't tell him he was out of his mind . Martin was stunned . " You do n't have to give me your answer now . Think it over . Take plenty of time . On second thought , not plenty , because I do n't know how much time I 've got , and I 'd like to close my eyes knowing that she 's cared for and protected by a man of decent character . I 'm a keen judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings on this table in front of you and leave the room . " " I appreciate that , Mr. Meig . But I have to tell you that I had n't thought of marriage for years yet . As you say , I am  --  at least I hope I am  --  a responsible man , and marriage is n't something that one just  --  " " Martin , let 's do without diplomacy , shall we ? This is a time for plain talk . You 're thinking , and I do n't blame you , that Jessie Meig is n't precisely what you had in mind when you thought of choosing a wife . I 'd be a fool if I did n't know that ! But I also know , and you do too , that burning love affairs usually go up in smoke anyway . Now , Jessie is an unusual human being . You 've said so yourself . She 's intelligent , she 's good company and she thinks the world of you . Anybody can see she does . She 'd be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And she 'd have reason to be grateful to you . " Martin winced and Meig saw it . " Yes , I did say grateful ' ! What 's wrong ? But you 'd be grateful to her , too , would n't you ? Because without her you 'd spend the rest of your life here , going to waste . " Martin stood up to get his coat . " Will you at least think about it ? " " I understand what you 've said , Mr. Meig , but  --  " Meig waved him aside . " Your impulse is to say no , absolutely not . ' You think if you accept , you 'll be selling yourself . Dishonoring yourself . Is n't that so ? " RANDOM WINDS 77 " I feel  --  " Martin began and was interrupted again . Behind the strict , rimless glasses the eyes were shrewd . " Sentimentality , Martin , sentimentality ! " Martin had one foot out of the door . " Of course she does n't have the remotest idea of what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide . " Martin was horrified . " No need to worry about that ! " " Very well , then . Just give it some thought , that 's all I ask . " It was such a cold night that , unless you knew better , you could lose an earlobe . In spite of the arctic air , Martin sweated . The shame of it ! He looked back at the house , wondering which of the second-story lights came from Jessie 's room . And with flashing insight , he thought he could feel how it would be for her , proud as she was , if she could know what had just passed between her father and himself . The proposition was , of course , unthinkable . Yet it had been well-intentioned , born of desperation . That this arrogant , private man should have revealed himself like that to a stranger ! What must he have seen in that stranger ? Ambition , obviously , but much more also : loyalty and kindness and honor . No question about that . He trusts me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dares to think I can be bribed ! Do n't be a pompous ass , Martin ; he did n't mean it that way ! It 's a bribe , all the same ! He 's terrified and wants to see his house in order . A human being has revealed his sorrow before you , Martin ! - But the thing 's impossible . And now a fine friendship has been spoiled for good . How can I feel free in that house anymore ? It was the most weird encounter , weird and sad ! The wind rushed and the night was inexpressibly lonely . The planet was small and shriveledwith the cold . And he went to bed thinking of loneliness . For two weeks he stayed away . Then it occurred to him that such an abrupt disappearance would be a cruel hurt to Jessie . And indeed , it had been .

" " Well , he was n't . Anyway , I do n't antagonize so easily . " " That 's not true . The truth is exactly the opposite . " " You 're right , as usual , " he admitted , and she laughed . Seated as usual in the great wing chair , with her cheeks gone pink78 THE ASCENTfrom the fire 's heat , and the pinpoint sparks of gold in her ears , she could have been so lovely ! If only  --  And he wondered whether anyone would ever marry her . Would anyone ever love her ? Respect , admiration , companionship  --  these would come easily in all the virtuous ways through which human beings relate to one another . And surely even tenderness could come . But love ? She said softly , " You 're very quiet , Martin . " " Sorry . I did n't mean to be . " He brought himself back into the moment . " By the way , I finished Main Street . I meant to return it tonight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like it ? " " Yes . It has the ring of truth . Depressing truth . " " I 've something else for you , quite different .

Especially good for you . " " Why for me ? " " Because it 's a story of a struggle . Always , even when he was a child , he knew he was going to be a composer , a great one . He faced everything  --  loneliness , poverty , rivalry ; but he never gave up . " " And did he win in the end ? " " Read it . " She forced his eyes to meet her own .

He had n't intended that ! Had n't intended to weaken or mislead this vulnerable small girl ! What had he done ? How had this come to be ? Clumsily he flipped the pages of the book she had put into his hands . " Seems like something I 'll hate to put down , " he said . Did he deserve to feel such guilt and shame ? Truly he had n't been aware that this was happening . Nor perhaps had she . Well , it would have to be stopped , that was all . Brought abruptly to a halt before any more damage was done . He simply would n't come here again . And swiftly , with such grace as he could summon , he escaped from the house . RANDOM WINDS 79There are days on which troubles accumulate and peak .

The last case in the afternoon would have broken Martin 's heart if he had allowed it to . Elsie Briggs was thirty-four , unmarried and the youngest of a large family . Hers was the old story of the daughter who stayed home to take care of her parents , wearing herself out for the senileand incontinent , locking herself away from life behind four dismal walls . And Elsie Briggs was finally breaking down . They would be takingher to the state hospital on Friday because there was nothing else to do with her .

All was gray : dim fields , gray air , steady snow . After two miserablehours , he pulled into a yard to find what he had expected : unpainted boards , a ramshackle porch , no light poles . If anybody needed cutting or stitching he would turn the car to let the headlights shine into the room . Rural poverty like this in the twentieth century ! In the bare kitchen stood a huddle of five runny-nosed babies and a thin mother , terrified because her husband was sick . Who was to tend to the man 's work ? The man had pneumonia .

And heaven knew , they must need everything from oranges to shoes ! So he left to slide and slip , downhill this time , the fifteen miles homeward .

My father 's kind hands lay folded over his black vest in the coffin . He gave the best care he could . He tried . My God , he did ! And that 's better than nothing , better than no care at all ! A man has to be satisfied with it . My father was satisfied . Quite without warning , not fifty feet ahead of the car , a tremendous limb , almost a quarter of a giant elm , split from the weight of ice and crashed on the road . In pounding panic , Martin swerved . If he 'd been a few feet farther along , all his problems would be over ! And he laughed at his own macabre humor . Indifferent nature ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully skirted his near-disaster . March was the most dismal month of all . Yet his father had loved it , had liked to talk of the stately cycle of the year , its rhythm and its grandeur .

Grand , yes ! Eternal . Majestic . All the orotund words . A man might well stand in awe of it . He understood that deeply . But everybody was n't meant for it , and he hated it , hated the loneliness , the monotony , the awful cold . He had never said it aloud before , but he said it now . " I hate it .

" Suddenly recalling Pa 's advice , he got the burlap from under thefront seat and placed it beneath the rear wheels . Then he started the engine . It roared and whined . The wheels spun furiously . It 's rubbing the tires to a thread , Martin thought . But at last they caught hold and the car lurched back onto the road . When he crept into the yard an hour later , the house was dark and he remembered that his mother had gone to an afternoon at the church , followed by a supper . She had left his meal on the coal stove in a covereddish . It was stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . The house smelled dank and musty . He ran down to the cellar where the furnace stood like a hungry monster beside a hill of glossy coal and flung the door open . There was no fire here , either . The monster had n't been fed and ashes were thick in the grate . Blasted boy ! His mother had arranged with Artie Grant to tend the fires today while she was gone , but obviously he had n't come . He went back upstairs to the rear porch for kindling wood . Each ice-encrusted piece had to be dislodged by sheer force . Now , back to the cellar with newspapers and matches . But first the ashes must be cleaned out . Martin'shead pounded as dust from the ashes set off a fit of coughing . He sweated and shivered , shoveling the ashes out , then shoveling the coal in . Last he shook down the grates , making a lonely rattle in the empty house . From the head of the stairs the collies stood observing him , while he watched the fire take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the kitchen . His mother had just come home . For an instant she was framed in the doorway , her pretty eyes anxious . She wore her old , black " good " coat ; the black feather on her hat was turning green . Humble . That 's how she looks , he thought . Mean word . Humble . " Goodness , look at you ! You 're all over ashes ! " she cried . " Yes . Where in blazes was Artie Grant ? " " He 's usually so dependable ! I guess the weather was just too bad for him to get here . " " It was , was it ! " Martin was furious . " Was n't too bad for me , though ! I only traveled thirty miles round trip to Danielsville and back ! " " Martin , " his mother said mildly . " Martin , you 're tired and hungry . " " Of course I am . Why not ? " After a day like this one , was it too much to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least rest when you came in ? When his supper was ready Ma sat down in the rocker near the table .

The world of ideas , that 's what he lived in , all that he cared about , " she reflected , sighing a little . The light fell over her head , over a smooth streak of gray that lay like a ribbon on her still-dark hair . She was talkative tonight . " Yes , he was a student of the world . He read everything . I 'm sorry I never had much time , and now it seems to be too late . I 'm out of the habit of reading . " She rocked : creak , creak . " Anyway , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things so much .

" " You could go now . It 's outrageous that you should have to think twice about having such a small pleasure . " " More than twice . We do n't have the money to spare . You 'll be needing a new car by summer . It 's a wonder this one has lasted as long as it has . " Never in all the years Martin had known his mother had she expressedany desires .

" " I 'm not like him , " Martin said . " That 's true . I 've never known anyone like him . " In the hall the old clock struck with a tinny bong . Ashes tinkled in the stove . His mother coughed , a thick phlegmy cough that she had n't been able to get rid of all winter . It was n't her fault , surely , but it was exasperating . And he had a sudden projection of himself on long , dull , winter nights like this one , sitting in a shabby room like this one with a faceless woman : not his mother , of course , but a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired a wife . The future was a dull road going endlessly uphill , downhill , uphill , stretched through an unchanging landscape ; at last , when one no longer hoped for any change , one would come to the final hill and just drop quietly off into the unknown .

But all the time , in other places , some men would have been doing what they wanted to do ! They learned , they lived , they moved ahead ! And there came again that old sense of rushing time which had haunted and beset him since adolescence . He was already twenty-eight ! Without meaning to , he smashed a fist into his palm and sprang up as if he had been shot . There was such tension in his solar plexus that he had to move , he had toHis mother looked up . " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just out . " " In this weather ? " For it had begun to sleet again . " I 've been in it all day . I 'm used to it . " " Oh , I forgot to tell you . While you were down cellar , Jessie Meig telephoned . Odd for a girl to telephone a young man , do n't you think so ? " " No . Just natural and honest . " " Her sister did n't do it , did she ? " No , Martin thought , she never did . " It 's not even very clever , if you ask me . She must be a strange girl , that Jessie Meig . " " Why do you always say that Jessie Meig ' as though you had somethingagainst her ? " " How could I have anything against her ? I do n't even know her .

" " Just to know why you 'd been staying away and whether you might want to come over this evening . " Twenty minutes later Martin stood in the Meigs ' library . It went very quickly . His mind had simply made itself up , and he did n't have to think about words . The father grasped Martin 's two hands in both of his . " You wo n't be sorry . It 's probably the wisest decision you 'll ever make . " There were tears in his eyes and at that moment Martin began to like him . " God bless you both . " Jessie 's answer to his question was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're doing ? " " I 'm sure . " " Because I do n't want to be an albatross around your neck . I could n't bear it . " " You will never be that , I promise ! " She had a pretty mouth and when she smiled , two charming dimples appeared at the corners . Taking her face between his hands he kissed her gently . " I 'll make life good for you , " he said . He meant it , with all his heart . BookTwoTHE fEBChapterFern always teased Alex that she had married him because she loved his house . " Well , naturally , " he would answer , " how could anyone help but fall in love with Lamb House ? " Among its oaks and orchards it lay as though , like them , it had been planted there ; so farsighted had they been , those Elizabethans with a sense of home and long generations . Through diamond-paned casements one looked south toward the villageof Great Barrow . Little Barrow lay three miles to the west . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowered and the hills rolled back into a haze . Fern turned from the easel . The spaniels , sprawled with noses to the grass , raised their heads in question . They had followed her across the Atlantic and shadowed every move she made . " No , " she told them , " I 'm not finished yet . " And she raised her eyes to the living picture beyond the easel . In the upper left-hand corner lay a green square dotted with pinpoints of white which seemed scarcely to move , although they were live sheep on the Ballister farm . Everything was small and perfect , as in a meticulous Book of Hours . The valley was the merest hollow in the swell of the land . " As if God 's finger touched , but did not press , in making England , " she said aloud , and was pleased with herself for quoting Elizabeth BarrettBrowning . She had been studying the English poets from Chaucer to88 THE WEBEliot , for if one were going to live in a country , she believed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know you well enough , I 'll confess , " Alex 's mother had told her only a few weeks before . " I was n't very happy about having an American daughter-in-law . So many American girls are simply not ladies ; I ca n't help saying it . But you are , and so very charming , Fern ! Everyone says so . " They had been standing in the upstairs hall , which , like the great one downstairs , was blazoned with family portraits : squires in **25;7723;TOOLONG and lace cuffs , clerics in grim black , an admiral with a three-cornered hat , two cabinet members  --  Tory , nineteenth century  --  and over one fireplace , the original Elizabethan with beefy face and sleepy eyes to whom this manor had been given for favors rendered the Crown somewhere in the West Indies . They were all Lambs . Alex 's mother came from a decent undistinguished family of schoolteachers . " Naturally , " Alex said with some amusement but no unkindness , " all this ancestor business means more to her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes irreverent about it . On a table in the angle of the stairwell stood a group of photographs in silver frames . " That , of course , is Edward VII as Prince of Wales , " the elder Mrs. Lamb had informed the younger . Fern had dutifully bent to read the scrawled inscription . " My husband often went on shooting parties in Scotland with His Royal Highness . " " Went whoring with His Royal Highness too , I 'll wager , " Alex had remarked in private . " I had this photo of Susannah put up here in the hall while you and Alex were on your wedding trip . It used to stand on the piano in the drawing room , but I should think that too conspicuous , not fitting , now that Alex has married you . " Fern had murmured that she would n't have minded , which was true . She felt no jealousy , although her mother-in-law apparently expected her to . The girl was dead , after all . Here she sat for all time in her patriciansimplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little finger . The one memorable feature of her neat face was a timid expression in the prominent eyes . Could she perhaps have had some forebodingthat she was going to die and leave her week-old boy ? " To tell the truth , I was never very happy about Susannah , although she was English to the bone . " Perhaps she had only been intimidated by this mother-in-law ! RANDOM WINDS 89 " You are far prettier , you know . " What an unnecessary , heartless thing to say ! " It 's a good thing Neddie has no idea about his mother . " " He 'll have to be told I 'm not his mother . " " Why , yes , sometime , of course . But he does love you , Fern . " " And I adore him . " Sometimes there is immediate bonding between two human beings . It has no connection at all with age or circumstance . It is simply there . " You 've handled him splendidly , everyone says so . " She knew it was said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference between him and her " own " infant girl . They did n't understand . Neddie was her " own . " " He 's not been jealous of the baby at all ! Usually they carry on dreadfullywhen a new baby comes into the house , or so I hear . Unfortunately , I never had more than one . You 're sure you 're not rushing things in that respect , Fern ? " This last had been spoken with a glance , a light progression of the eye as it blinks in its rhythm and recovers from the blink , toward the midsection of Fern 's body , where the new swelling was just barely visible . " After all , Emmy 's not a year yet . " " The doctor says I 'm quite healthy . " Fern 's own patience surprised her . Two years ago she would have had to swallow exasperation ; now she was learning to see beneath the surface of people and things . Behind this pallid face with its indrawn lips , behind the accent  --  which , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal family 's accent  --  she saw a lonely woman who had striven foolishly all her life . So she said gently , " If this one 's a boy , we shall name him Alex , of course . Will he be the fifth or the sixth ? " " He will be the sixth Alexander Lamb . Should you want me to come a week or two ahead of time to plan for the christening , I 'm sure I 'll be able to manage it . And I can stay on afterward , as long as you like . " Poor soul ! She was waiting to be invited to live with them at Lamb House . But that , Fern thought , I will not do . She 's perfectly wellhousedat Torquay with all the other prosperous widows . No , that I will certainly not do . " You know , " Mrs. Lamb had complained , " it 's Neddie who should have borne the name . Do n't you think it 's disgraceful that Susannah insisted on naming him for her father ? True @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , the first-born son should be named after his father . " " Well , anyway , he looks like Alex , " Fern had assured her , although it was probably not true . Neddie would be narrower and darker than Alex . But it was what the older woman wanted to hear. 90 THE WEB RANDOM WINDS 91Pregnancy , like love , she thought now , can be calming to the nerves . The doctor said some women became euphoric . This inner radiance then , this vitality and warm contentment with her own body , the home and the people who surrounded her  --  this must be euphoria . And , taking up the brush , she corrected some greens with a stipling of gilt where the sun had glazed them . A little group came in sight around the corner of the house : Neddie , running ahead of the nurse who was pushing Emmy in the perambulator . Fern held out her arms and the little boy ran into them . She put her face down on his crisp hair which smelled of pine shampoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shy with strangers had so readilyaccepted her and loved her . He wiggled free . " Shall we have music again , Mummy ? " he asked . " Mummy 's busy , " Nanny Hull admonished . " Later this afternoon , darling . We 'll put a record on . " " The singing man ? " She laughed . " Yes , yes , the singing man . " Neddie had come into the room when Alex had a Caruso recording on the phonograph . Without making a sound , he had sat down to listen , and then had waited while Alex wound the phonograph again to repeat it . " And will I have yellow cake , too ? " There had been a cake with yellow icing that day , and now they were turning into a ritual , the singing man and the cake . " You 'll have cake , if you promise to eat your supper . You must n't stuff on sweets , " Nanny said . " Of course he must n't . " The baby Emmy was asleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would be large-boned , as if she belonged entirely to Alex and not at all to her mother . With curiosity Fern touched the pink hand that lay curled like a shell on the blanket . I do n't know her yet , she thought . Everything is closed up , a gift in a glossy box . It is delivered at the door , and one can only guess what is possibly inside . But it is all there , and there 's little we can change . Still , at the same time , we could teach her anything , could n't we ? Mandarin Chinese , if we wanted to , instead of English ? Everything is so confusing . I feel light-headed . " Have you had a bit too much of the sun , Ma'am ? If you do n't mind my saying so , you ought to put up your work for a while today . You 've been at it since noon . " The woman spoke considerately and probably sincerely , except forher use of the word " work . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . " " Yes , thank you , Nanny . Perhaps I shall . " " It 's fearful hot today . " Funny what the English called fearful heat ! It could n't be more than eighty . Still , she obeyed , as Nanny drew the wicker lounge chair into the shade and plumped the cushions . " There you are ! A nice bit of nap will do you good . I 'm to take Neddiedown to his pony and he 'll go for a ride with Mr. Lamb . " Fern closed her eyes , letting the drowsiness of pregnancy have its way . She was so catered to , so loved and cared for ! How many women with two children had leisure to go all deliciously relaxed and limp ? One could feel so guilty thinking about one 's unearned privileges . Old Carfax , stirring in the perennial border , struck a stone with his hoe . He was being careful not to wake her . He was a wiry little man , pasty-skinned in spite of a life out in the weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it was an extension of his back , of his roped and sinewy arms . Fern opened her eyes just as he stooped to remove a thread of weed which would have marred the perfection of the rosebeds . She watched him move on through the perennials : violet steeples of campanula , gold coreopsis , dusty dark-blue globes of echinops . Fragrance of stock and musky spice of phlox hung in the sweet air . Behind the border stood a solid wall of yews , still wet with last night 's rain . " The yews are as old as the house , " Alex had told her the first time he had brought her here . " We 've a priest 's hole on the third floor behind a false wall . I 'll show you . Part of the family was Catholic , you know , but it got to be too dangerous for them , I suppose , and we 've all been C. of E. for two hundred years at least . They also say Cromwell slept here , but I do n't know whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those houses at home , where Washington 's supposed to have slept while he was chasing you or you were chasing him . " They had been sitting on the stone bench , the one where Carfax had just now set a flat of Michaelmas daisies . They 'd sat there talking for an hour or more , then quite suddenly Alex had asked her to marry him and as suddenly she had accepted . Yet they had really been leading up to that moment from the time they had been introduced in the winter . Aunt Milly had pursued her purpose with utmost tact , to be sure ! And ordinarily Fern would have been outraged by any such " scheme , " but because she herself was so strongly drawn to Alex , she had n't objected . He was delightful . It was , quite simply , good to be with him . It was92 THE WEB RANDOM WINDS 93heartening  --  was that the right word ? Yes , heartening was a very good word , she decided . There was a kind of crinkling good nature in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had told him so . She was not used to men who laughed . Certainly Father had done very little laughing ! He had a fine curiosity about practically everything . At dinner he could listen to Uncle Drew 's talk of securities and German reparations . He could ask pertinent questions of a guest concerning blight-resistant roses . With a cricketeer he talked scores and plays . One felt that he could manage anything . And he had a certain reserve ; Fern was comfortable with that . Traveling through Europe , she had had to fend off too many young men on dark hotel terraces . To a girl whose life had been unusually reclusive , that sort of thing could be flattering at first , but after a while one got tired of having to decide between accepting sticky kisses when one felt nothing for the man or , by resisting , risk being labeled " prig . " But Alex had been satisfied to go slowly , sensing her wish to feel the way , to move as a river flows , deepening to the place where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the more marvelous for having come gradually . So she had read , and so she believed . Obviously he was affected by his responsibilities . He had inherited a substantial business in maritime insurance ; but unlike many young heirs he had not turned it over to managers ; he ran it himself . The greater responsibility , of course , was to his child . She remembered the day he had first brought Neddie to the hotel . They had been on the way to the zoo . She had opened the door and there they had stood , the tall man and Neddie , who was just two . She had knelt , putting out her arms , and the little boy had come quite willingly , while she murmured the things adults do . " What a fine big boy you are ! And is this your bear ? How are you , Toby Bear ? " She had been fourteen , almost grown , when her mother died . The loss had seemed to mark her more than any other happening in her life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so moved by Alex 's child , when he put his hand in hers . " Strange , " Alex said . " He 's usually quite timid with people he does n't know . " Alex 's eyes had been very soft and in that instant Fern had known he could be trusted . All during the late winter and early spring they saw London together . Alex had friends in a variety of circles : business , music , society and art . They ate with a pair of schoolteachers in Soho and dined at Claridge'sbefore the opera . They walked in the parks and on streets which Fern had visited with Jane Austen , with Thackeray and Galsworthy . And , as so many Americans do , she fell in love with the grand , old , mellow city . In a mews near Curzon Street Alex had a flat furnished , as she was later to learn , like Lamb House . Oak and yew were seventeenth-century ; mahogany was eighteenth-century ; the landscapes were nineteenthcentury . Here was the progression of the family , marching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him he ought to be in some businesshaving to do with the arts  --  antiques or a picture gallery . He had been pleased . " But maritime insurance is more lucrative . I can always buy art . Some day I 'll be buying a Meig , you know . " " You 've never seen any of my work . How can you say that ? " she had replied . " Just a feeling I have about you . " They had been having dinner at the flat , so he was a host being courteousand that was all . Yet she could remember everything that had been said . She had sighed . " I 'm so confused in my mind . I wish I knew whether I had any potential . " " There 's only one way to find out . By doing . It 's a shame you have n't had more encouragement . " " More ? I 've had none at all . " Except for Martin Farrell 's . He , admittedly knowing nothing about art , had nevertheless urged her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Alex , she had become aware of the letter in her purse which had arrived from Martin just that morning . It had been written in a state of joyous excitement . She , with her own hopes , had understood that a door had been flung open for him , a wide and generous entrance to the future ! And she was very , very glad for him . But there had also been a faint sense of shame . She had thought , all the weeks of that hot , lovely summer in Cyprus and especially on the last night , that something was growing  --  that given time , perhaps when she came home . . . She had obviously been mistaken . Three years of further study ! Very likely he would n't marry until long after that . Women , herself included , tended to be foolish about doctors , as about pianists or romantic actors , whom young girls pursue and old ladiesadore . Foolish . Foolish . " London suits you , " Alex had remarked abruptly 94 THE WEB RANDOM WINDS 95And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had reminded him : " I 'm also a country person . " " What you need , " he 'd said , " is to have a home in a quiet country place where you can paint , yet be near enough to the city for first-rate classes . " And he had reached across the table to press her hand . Not long afterward they had driven to his village . It had a cobbled High Street , a chemist 's and tobacconist 's and an ancient church . " There 's where the Lambs are christened , married and buried . That 's the lich-gate . They used to rest the bier there , but now we trim it with white flowers for brides . There 's the riding club where I keep three horses . It 's only a stone 's throw from home , and it 's just as easy to stablethem there . Do you ride ? Yes ? Oh , there 's nothing like riding just after dawn when everyone but birds and roosters is still asleep ! " So they had rounded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drowsing in hazy , filtered light . There it lay , sturdy , secure and most of all so brightly cheerful . It seemed like a place Fern had always known . It seemed as if there could be no deeper joy than to stay here with this gentle , loving man , in this golden peace . Promptly then , cablegrams went out to Father and Jessie at home . Letters went back and forth across the ocean . Lists were written and arrangementsmade . Aunt Milly rejoiced . Alex 's mother rejoiced . An engagementsolitaire was bought at Asprey 's . Fern sent instructions home . Father must bring the photograph of Mother in her room . They must crate and ship her books and all her paintings . They were to bring the sterling which had been put aside for her , Tiffany 's Audubon Birds . ( " Animals , naturally , " Jessie had remarked , with her usual tart humor , which happened to be accurate , for Fern had also asked them to bring along her collection of dog etchings as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole months in quarantine . ) The wedding was held at Lamb House . Just as Alex had said , the lich-gate had been trimmed with white flowers . They had ridden back from the church in a carriage , also decked with flowers . Neddie had worn a powder-blue velvet suit and had his picture taken with the bride and groom , while old ladies wiped their tears . Everyone in the village had been invited . There was champagne for all in the great courtyard square and there was dancing indoors under the enormous chandeliers . The dining hall was illuminated by silver candelabra as tall as a man . The vermeil dinner service , taken from the vault for the occasion , glittered between bowls of old Carfax 's prize roses in bridal pink and cream . " Positively medieval , " Jessie remarked . " I did n't think they still did this sort of thing . " Then more softly , she said , " But it was beautiful , Fern , and I shall want all your photos to remember it by . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had never been anywhere and had so longed to go " beyond , " the very thought had been intoxicating . In the eyes and ears of her mind she saw and smelled enchantment : red lacquer , gold thread , frangipani and patchouli , jasmine , burn and blaze . Unfortunately , Alex had been seasick most of the time . She had felt sorry for him , not only on account of his physical misery , but because she saw he was humiliated . Then at the end of the sixth week , she too became a victim , but for a different reason : she was pregnant . It must have happened almost immediately , on the night they spent ashore at Gibraltar , visiting some friends of Alex 's father . That , and the few other nights they had slept on land , had been the only normal ones on the trip . So it had been rather a queer honeymoon ! Poor Alex !

He had taught her about bills and bank accounts , things difficult enough to master in a strange currency , especiallyhard for her who had never handled money at all . He 'd been so good about all that ! And so good about her work : True to his promise he had arranged for the best classes in the city , in particular an outstandingclass in oils with Antonescu . For the first time she had been able to feel she was learning . " Well , how are you doing ? " Alex came around the house and laid a hand on her shoulder . " Painting or stomach , do you mean ? " " Both . " " Stomach 's queasy unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Biscuit . " " Well , someday I will remember to call a cracker a biscuit , I promise . How was the ride ? " " Marvelous .

Fm rather too heavy for her , though . " There was n't an ounce of extra weight on Alex . He glows , she thought ; from his boots to his bright hair and outdoor skin , he shines as if he had been gilded . " We 'll make a rider out of Neddie , too . You should have seen him on his pony this afternoon . " " He was n't scared at all ? He 's only four , Alex ! " " That 's the time to start . And he loves it . " Alex examined her picture . " You know , you 've got the perspective on the hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't imitate anymore ? You 're developing a style of your own . " " Maybe . Antonescu says I still pay too much attention to detail , though . It should sweep more , it should feel more careless . I understand what he means , but it 's not easy to do it . " A bicycle bell tinkled up the drive . In a moment Mrs. MacHugh from the village would appear around the curving shrubbery , bringing the afternoonmail . " I 'll get it , " Alex said . It was past time for a letter from home . Of late , Fern had been troubledby thoughts of home . Aunt Milly had written that Father had seemed unusually tired on her last visit to Cyprus . There 'd been a history of heart trouble among the men in the family . If Father were to die , what would become of Jessie ? And Fern had a vivid recollection of her sister sitting with the cards spread out for an elaborate game of solitaire ; the little face , surrounded by arabesques of curls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stood abruptly and walked to the front of the house , where Mrs. MacHugh , having just handed the mail to Alex , was turning the bicycle back down the drive .

The note from Jessie filled just one page . " I shall be in England a week after you receive this . " In England ? But how ? But why ? " Read Father 's letter . He will explain it all . He can do a better job of writing than I can just now . " Prick of pin , quiver of apprehensive chill as when a running cloud covers the sun . Tiny shudder as when a jangling note is struck on the piano . She opened her father 's letter and read it quickly through . Then she read it again . RANDOM WINDS 97 " Oh no ! " she cried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fern laughed . The sound was harsh and queer . " What is it ? " Alex repeated .

" Why ? Is it all that strange ? " " For goodness sake , do n't you think it is ? " " Well , I suppose one might n't actually expect Jessie to marry , and yet she  --  " Fern sat up . The wave of sickness had subsided . " I think it 's  --  I think it 's disgusting ! " " I do n't understand . Do you know the man , by the way ? " " Yes , he 's a doctor , as you read . A country doctor . It 's  --  farm country , hills , something like Scotland . Yes , it looks something like Scotland , " she said irrelevantly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ? " Fern swallowed , as if a lump of some tough substance stuck in her throat . " It 's hard to describe him . " She shook her head , frowning . " He is a very intelligent man with a wide-ranging mind . A quiet man with a lot of restless energy . But that 's contradictory and complex  --  " " We 're all contradictory , some of us more than others . Anyway , if he and Jessie love one another , I do n't see why you call that disgusting . " " She may be in love with him . I 've no doubt she is . But as for him , well , could you be in love with Jessie ? " " I 'm not , so I ca n't answer for myself . That does n't mean some other man could n't be . And I did like her a lot , you know . I thought she had wit and heart . " " He ca n't love her ! It 's impossible . " " You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be glad for them . For Jessie . " " Did you read the whole thing ? They 're taking a flat in London . He 'll be working here for the next three years . " " So then he wo n't be a country doctor , after all , will he ? They 'll have a whole other life . " " Yes , a whole other life . " Alex got up and drew Fern to her feet . " Let 's go in . I need to shower and change . Then I want tea . Yes , you ought to be glad for them , " he repeated , climbing the stairs . Fern lay down on the bed . Water rushed in the bathroom shower , fogging the mirror on the open door so that she saw herself in a blur . Lying there in the middle of the enormous bed she looked forlorn and she felt ashamed . Why should she begrudge Jessie this miraculous deliv-erance ? Whenever she thought of her sister she saw her small and huddled , sometimes even crying with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jessie was a measurement , a symbol of deprivation and unfair disadvantage . Her thoughts went to Martin . " A quiet man , " she had told Alex a few minutes ago , " with a lot of restless energy . " She might have added more : a sensitive man , perceptive , tense , reserved , intellectual , kind , proud , ambitious  --  yet not one of these words , even the word " ambitious , " made clear how he could have married Jessie . She was bitterly angry . " After they 're settled in , " Alex said , rubbing himself dry , " we 'll give a party for them . " His eyes crinkled with friendliness . He liked parties . " We 'll have a little band and string lights in the trees . Welcome to Englandand all that . What do you think ? " " Lie down here with me , " she said . " I thought you did n't feel like  --  " " I only meant , hold me . We do n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head down to his shoulder . " You do n't feel well . I can wait . There 's more between us than only that , I should hope . " Yes . And she thought : I do wonder what all the mystery is for ? One gets the idea that it is the purpose of everything , this entrance of the man into the woman , when actually it is such a quick thing , not at all like the fuss that 's made over it . What 's really best is to be held and loved , to wake up in the night and not be alone . To be cared for as Alex cares . He 's done so much for me . I 've grown so much with the things he 's taught me . Her hands went to the rounded hill below her ribs . The baby fluttered for the first time . Its new life , thumping , had knocked at the door . How wrong of her to feel anger or anything but thankfulness and  --  and gladness ! She had everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " We 've an hour before tea . " The sky suddenly had gone dark and chilly . A gust of rain battered the windows . He drew the coverlet about them both , while her head still rested in the curve of his shoulder . So warmed , her tremors eased . Ah , foolish , she thought . Alex is right , it is no business of ours ! AsRANDOM WINDS 99long as we 're here together , with Ned and Emmy and whoever it is that 's stretching and turning inside me now , why should I care what other people do ? In a few minutes , she drifted into the sweetest sleep . Chapter9Martin stepped outside into a fragrant morning ; the air was damp on the skin . Here in England June still had the feel of spring . It was a long walk to St. Bartholomew 's , but he enjoyed starting his workday at the hospital with the vigor and well-being that came after exercise . And with this sensation of well-being he crossed through the park and turned down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good year . He smiled , still warmed by the hour he had spent since he had got up , in the pleasant flat above the square of chestnut trees and sycamores . Jessie and he had breakfasted at the bow window that overlooked all the bird-filled greenery . His last sight before leaving was of her puttering over some lastmomenttouch on the little room which had been readied for the baby who was due right now  --  perhaps even today ! He had n't really planned to have a child this soon . But apparently Jessie had ! She would be an excellent mother , he reflected . He had n't thought much about that until now , but on these solitary walks all sorts of thoughts streamed through one 's head . . . . Yes , she would be excellent , with all that energy , remarkable energy for so small a body . Well organized , too ; everything was planned out beforehand so that the actual doing seemed always to be easy . He marveled at this ability of Jessie 's to manage things , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a household of children . Cheerful . That was Jessie . If you had to think of a single adjective that above all else described her , cheerful would surely do as well as any . Suddenly he recalled the day they had moved into the flat ; it was aRANDOM WINDS loxfurnished sublet , drably decorated ; it had been raining that afternoon and the drabness , combined with the pelting rain , had depressed him so that he 'd almost wanted to turn around and walk out  --  he who never reallycared that much about possessions or the appearances of things ! But what wonders Jessie had done with those rooms ! She 'd filled them with flowers , inexpensive daisies in bright blue glass bowls . She 'd hung travel posters on the walls , delightful scenes of golden places : the Fountainsof Vaucluse and Venice and Segovia . She 'd become a devotee of the flea markets : one day she 'd come home lugging a tarnished , wretched old pot that turned out to be a splendid silver tea kettle . She 'd been so pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jessie did , and knew how to stretch her mind . She 'd stretched his mind , too , leading him through every gallery and museum in the city . They had gone to Elizabethan plays and the ballet and of course to the opera that he loved so well , and rummaged through old bookshops . In the fall they 'd gone to Paris ; there had been a neurological conferenceat the Salpetriere ; they 'd walked their feet off down every alley and into every corner . Christmas week had been celebrated in Rome . They had seen palms growing in Cornwall . They had traveled to Ulster and visited the stony village where Martin 's father had been born and a long line before him had died . Martin had been immensely moved by its loneliness and dignity . Yes , it had been a remarkable year and he had Jessie to thank for it . Not that he had n't had some trepidation at the beginning ! Once havingpassed the first shock and splendor of the opportunity with Braidburn , he had come to the awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought had plagued him all the way across the Atlantic Ocean . He had felt  --  he had n't known quite what it was he had felt , other than a decided discomfort and a wish that he might somehow avoid the whole business , which was , of course , impossible . They had been driven straight to Lamb House . It had been one of those gray-green English afternoons , halfway between rain and heavy mist . The sky had been filled with noisy birds , starlings and rooks ; the country looked soft , he had thought . " I like this kind of day . I 've grown used to it , " Mary had said , answeringsome comment about the weather . Queer that he should remember such a slight remark ! She had been standing in the doorway when they drove up . The boyNeddie had been on one side and a tiny girl , just able to stand , hadbeen on the other . And he had wondered whether she was aware of thepicture she made , blooming with her two children and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone walking about the102 THE WEBgrounds . Naturally , Jessie had described Lamb House beforehand , but no description could have done justice to it in Martin 's mind . He had had no frame of reference for such a place . Intending nothing , truly intending nothing by the trivial words , he had remarked , " This is a long way from Cyprus , is n't it ? " And with unmistakable anger , Mary had repeated , " Yes , is n't it ? " Surely she could n't have been jealous of Jessie ? After all , she had n't wanted him for herself ! So it had come to Martin 's mind that she must be resentful over the marriage because she thought him some sort of fortune hunter . This idea had stung him , and still would have done so if he allowed it to . For he was , after all , living on another man 's money , was n't he ? And living well . Perhaps , then , he did look like a  --  a fortune hunter ? But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for everything . They would live better yet on what he , Martin , would provide . His wife and children would depend on no one else but him . Fortune hunter ! And what of Mary 's motives ? Ah , but that was unfair ! Alex was a man to be desired by women , a kindly , generous , intelligent man who happened to have wealth . Martin himself could surely have been bitter at the sight of him , not because he had any remnant of desire for Mary  --  she had rejected him and that was the end of that !  --  but because of normal resentment toward the winner . Instead he had come to like Alex . You could n't help but like him . Occasionally , still , he could remember his first anguish over Mary , how painfully and slowly it had ebbed into anger and how the anger had finally seeped away into nothing . Oh , there was some small disturbanceyet  --  embarrassment , that was all . He was still and probably always would be so damned touchy ! A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcing himself to get over this embarrassment . Mary too had evidently got over it , or over whatever it was that had made her so cold when he and Jessie had first arrived . Perhaps she saw now that he was working hard , and would get somewhere in the world and was in the meantime making a good life for Jessie . So the relationship between the two couples was cordial enough , although it was not a close one . Every now and then they met in town for dinner or theater . Two or three times Martin and Jessie had been at Lamb House amid a bustle of guests and children . Jessie had declined the last few invitations and he had concurred . He really did n't have the time to spare ; he was n't his own master as Alex was . Besides , the Lambs ' was a different world . Alex , the Englishman , naturally had friends in many circles . Jessie and Martin , strangers both , were very slowly enlarging their little group one by one , or rather , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive establishment ; she was busy in the domainof art ; he had countless business obligations . Their lives were complicated . The Farrells ' life was simple . And they were satisfied with its simplicity . " You 're happy , Martin , I can see , " Jessie liked to say , not questioning or doubting , merely taking pleasure in his pleasure , and expressing the euphoria which had bloomed with her pregnancy . He , in turn , took pleasure in seeing that euphoria , and in the calm , fine trust between them . . . He looked at his watch and quickened his walk . He was due in the operating room at eight . This was Mr. Braidburn 's day . " Mr. "  --  funny English mode of address to a doctor ! And now Martin 's mind leaped ahead , away from his own concerns , toward the hospital where he had spent the larger part of this past year . Even when he was away from that building , his heart was still in it ! " What happened to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he would ask himself . " To the ironworker with the third-degree burns who 'd got a piece of steel in the brain ? " And his memory would go back in time to the story Pa had told so long ago of the scalded child in the farmhouse kitchen . Poor Pa ! He 'd had the will to help , but not the tools . Now Martin had those tools in hand . There were just three young Americans and half a dozen Englishmen working in the wards and clinics , examining and selecting the patients to be discussed on the following day . Often Martin wondered how much these patients understood , as they were wheeled in before the instructorsand assembled students . Most of them were simply too frightened to understand very much , he thought , which was just as well . God pity them : the paralyzed ; the afflicted with their jerking limbs and senseless laughter ; the soon-to-die . Most of them were poor and inarticulate , struggling for words even when they must know clearly enough what they wanted to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a person ? Will I die ? " Their shabby imitation-leather pocketbooks , clasped stiffly on their laps , were sad to him . He dreamed of his mother . She had owned that same kind of shabby black bag . He dreamed that it was lying on the kitchen table at home . His mother was crying , " I 've lost my pocketbook , " and he was telling her , " Why , here it is , Ma . Do n't you see it ? " But she only kept on crying and wringing her hands . The poor moved him so . He pitied animals . So soft he was ! He must learn to hide it ! In the laboratory he worked on monkeys and dogs . It made him sick to touch their fur , to win their trust only to terrorize them later . Yet it had to be104 THE WEBdone . How else to learn what cells do after stroke or how brain wounds heal ? How else to learn anything ? Fortunately , Evan Llewellyn , wiry dark Welshman , great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He kept suffering to a minimum . Otherwise Martin could not have stood it . It was a privilege when he was allowed to share a small basement laboratory with Llewellyn . Jessie , having overheard Martin talking about microscopes , had bought him a beautiful Zeiss , and there with Llewellyn and the Zeiss , during long afternoons and often late into the evenings , he lay the foundation of all he was to know about the pathologyof the cell . He was becoming increasingly convinced of what Dr. Albeniz had said about the unity of all brain study : surgery , neurocytology , and even psychiatry were parts of a single discipline and ought not to be separated . The practitioners in these divisions must know what the others were doing . " Too many neurosurgeons blunder into the brain , " Llewellyn declared . He was nearly eighty , with cheerful eyes and a face remarkably unlined . " Never stop learning , " he would say . Whenever he was challengedfor coming in on holidays or Sundays , he had an answer . " When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well be . " Martin thought : That 's what my father used to say . And a truer thing was never said , he added to himself , as he rounded the corner and made his way to St. Bartholomew 's door . Braidburn talked as he worked , his steady voice instructing and explaining . This was the third hour and he was tiring . A drop of sweat stood on his forehead ; a nurse stepped forward to wipe it before it could slide . " Look here . The size of an orange . " Martin blotted seeping blood with gauze . A year ago he had been puzzled at first sight of these absorbent squares , each with its dangling black thread . Now he knew so much ; also he knew how much he did not know . And he remembered his fear when a brain was first exposed beneath his own hands , when he was first permitted , under supervision , to take the knife . " Sponge , " Braidburn ordered . The patient was young . Martin had seen him first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a couple of whining children . He had a wizened city face , a clerk 's face , respectful and scared . Relating his symptoms , his mouth had twisted . RANDOM WINDS 105 " I ca n't seem to stand up straight . I feel like vomiting . The headache'ssplitting and my eyesight 's queer . " Through the ophthalmoscope Martin had observed the hemorrhaging retina and the enlarged head of the optic nerve . " See anything , Doctor ? " " Well , " he 'd answered kindly , evasively , " we 'll need to take X-rays , you know . Then we 'll see about straightening you out . " He had known then what the pictures would show : a tumor pushing up under the temporal lobe ; slow growing , he would guess . Also , he had thought , or felt , that it would be nonmalignant ; he had not voiced the thought to anyone . There was something odd about the appearance of the person when malignancy was present . Again , that was only a feeling he had . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . But Pa had often been wrong . This time Martin had been right : the tumor was benign and encapsulated . A little thrill went through him , remembering the pale wife and children . Also , he was pleased with himself . " The rest is up to the gods , " Braidburn said now . " We 've done all we can . " He looked up . " Close the flap , Farrell , please . Jasper , assist . I 've finished . " There ought to be applause , Martin thought . Some of his fellow studentscomplained that men like Braidburn were arrogant and difficult . Braidburn in particular had been labeled " manic-depressive . " But he was merely a man of moods . Martin loved him , as he loved all these men and loved this place . A few hours later , he had just taken a seat at the bench downstairs with old Llewellyn when the telephone rang . Martin spoke a moment and hung up . " My wife 's at the hospital in labor . " " Hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Llewellyn cried . Martin tore upstairs and started to race toward the taxi-rank . Mr. Meredith intercepted him . " Llewellyn called upstairs . Get in . We 'll drive you . " So it was that Martin went in a limousine to the meeting with his firstborn . Meredith was considerately silent . Martin wondered what he could be thinking . Perhaps the same thought that he himself had been stifling and that now had abruptly shot up again from some buried place in his consciousness . It had been foolhardy to permit a pregnancy ! What if the child were like its mother ? How terrible and cruel ! The child would despisethem , and rightly so , for having brought it into the world . And.ro6 THE WEBJessie  --  poor Jessie  --  would be destroyed by guilt . Martin shook with fear . All the day 's contentment shivered away . Meredith was saying , " I met Fleming once . Looks like anybody else . Penicillin will absolutely revolutionize medicine . . . although some patientsare allergic to it . But I should n't bother you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin on the knee . " Just watch that Achillesheel . " " What ? " Martin asked in confusion . " We all develop one , you know . The moment the child is born . Whatever happens to it after that will happen to you , every cut and bruise . Ah well , here we are . Good luck . " At the desk they told him Jessie was already in the delivery room . " Make yourself comfortable in the waiting room . We 'll call you as soon as we know anything . " The waiting room was vacant except for a woman reading a book . When Martin entered she put it down and he saw that the woman was Mary Fern . She smiled . " You were operating , so Jessie called me when the pains came very suddenly . I 've been with her until just now . " " Thanks awfully . Is she all right ? " " Very excited . Very happy , between pains . " Martin sat down , took a magazine and could n't read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and you do n't know what they mean , " Mary observed . " I know . " " Try a picture magazine , it 's easier . " She added gently , " I know you 're a doctor , but when it 's your own baby , I suspect you forget you 're a doctor , do n't you ? So let me tell you , it 's not so bad having a baby . She 'll be all right . She really will . " " Thanks again . " " I 'm glad I happened to be in town . We 're staying in overnight . " It occurred to Martin that he had n't been alone in a room with Mary since  --  since Cyprus , and seldom enough even then . This thought created an intimacy in the commonplace , impersonal room . Absurd ! He smelled a slight fragrance : her perfume . When she turned a page he heard the faint jingle of an ornament on her gold bracelet . For some reason the sound was irritating . He wished she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spoke to her pleasantly . " The country must be beautiful this month . " " Yes , it 's heavenly . But you 're making conversation . You do n't really feel like talking now . Do n't bother about me , please . . . . I 'll just sit here and read . " RANDOM WINDS 107The stillness was oppressive . An hour ticked by . At every passing step in the hall he looked up , thinking it was for him . Mary looked up too ; they exchanged anxious glances . She returned to the book , rustling the pages . The bracelet jingled . He wished again that she would leave . Her presence , as he sat there with nothing to do but let his mind wander , brought him a mean recollection . At a luncheon table when he had first arrived at St. Bartholomew 's , Henry Barker had unknowingly humiliated him . Barker was Braidburn 's associate , a garrulous , informal man , rather un-English . Martin remembered every word he had said . " To tell you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Braidburn , I thought probably a loan was being called in , a return for old friendship , you know . I ca n't say whether Braidburn thought the same . We had no idea we were getting a gifted man . For you are that , Martin ! " And he had gone on , " I look forward to meeting your wife . Only the other day we were talking about our visit to America with the Braidburns when we met your wife and her family . A lovely child she was , about fourteen , I should think . Tall for her age , with the most extraordinaryblue eyes . I never forgot . " Martin had said evenly , " That was Mary Fern . She 's married to an Englishman , and they live in Oxfordshire when they 're not at their flat in town . " Mr. Barker had been confused . " Oh ? How many sisters are there , then ? I seem to remember only two . " " There are just two . I married the other one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Why did he not expunge them like a chalk scribble on a blackboard ? Just wipe them out ? Mary stood up . " I 'm supposed to meet Alex 's mother and bring her home for dinner . " She looked at her watch . " Will you think it awful of me if I leave you ? " " No , no , go ahead . And give my best to Alex . " " You 'll call me the minute you hear ? We 'll be at the flat all evening . " " Of course . " He watched her go down the street . She still had that slight sway in her walk . Her skirt swung gracefully . It was funny , a few years ago women all wore dresses to the knees . Now their skirts were threequartersof the way to the ankle . How quickly one grew accustomed to change ! " Do n't you think Alex has done a lot for Fern ? " Jessie had asked recently . He had answered that he did n't know what she meant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status and freedom had made a woman out of a girl . He watched her as far as the corner . A man turned to look after her as she passed ; struck , maybe , by the blue eyes in the dark face ? A mere accident of coloring and charm , and men , poor fools , were beguiled ! But what should all that matter to him ? And he felt abruptly angry . It did not matter ! His life was filled . He had his work , his home and now a child . And the child would be normal ! Of course it would ! By the law of averages it would ; he ought not to have let himself succumb to any morbid thought that it could be otherwise , or to morbid thoughts of any sort . Such thoughts were wasteful and therefore stupid , and he knew better . Think of bright things , good things , purpose ; think not of the past , but of the years to come . . .

This is what life is all about  --  A man in a surgeon 's white coat was walking toward him . " Mr. Far- rell ? " Martin stood up with a question on his lips , afraid to ask it . " A healthy child , and your wife is all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her now . " They entered the elevator . " We had to do a Caesarian section , " the other man said . " Tried not to , but there was n't enough room . The spine , of course . " Martin followed him down the corridor . He was struck with the odd- ity of himself in the role of follower . Was this how people felt toward him , waiting for his words to fall ? " I would not recommend having any more , Mr. Farrell . " Sober eyes admonished Martin . " I 'm very , very serious about that . " " I understand . Certainly not . " The man switched to sympathy . " You 've had a couple of bad hours . " " Yes , " Martin said , and to his own shame was suddenly aware that his terrors had not been first for Jessie , but for his boy , his son . Hewondered what anyone who could know that would think of him . He went in to Jessie . Her face was white as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender contrition , he stooped and kissed her forehead , and stroked her damp , curly hair . Murmuring , she closed her eyes . " She 'll sleep now , " the nurse said . " Would you like to see the baby ? " At the nursery door he was shown a bundle wrapped in a pink blanket . He remembered that he had n't even inquired the sex of the child and he felt a draining disappointment . " A lovely girl , " the nurse said . He stared at the baby . She was unmarked by struggle through the birth canal , and she had long dark hair . The nurse was jovial . " You could almost braid it , could n't you ? " He knew he was supposed to respond with the usual comic , awkward pride of the new father . But there was only a sinking in his chest . His little son ! And this was the last chance . The baby opened her eyes . It was impossible , of course , but she seemed to be staring straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded one another . Then she yawned , the pink mouth making a perfect 0 , raised her hand and dropped it in exquisite relaxation . " She 's bored with our company , " the nurse said , laughing . Against all rules , Martin put his finger into that miniature palm . At once the miniature fingers curled around his thick one . How strong she was ! Already reaching out to life and grasping ! The tiny thing ! He felt a lump in his throat . The tiny thing ! And she was perfect , without a flaw . A rush of gratitude went through him ; he felt the old warning tingle of rising tears . At the same time he wanted to laugh . Perfect , without a flaw ! Beautiful , too , with a straight little nose , strong curved chin and thick lashes , lying now on cheeks whose skin was fine as silk . His girl . " What will you name her ? " the nurse asked . He had to think a moment of the name they had selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , between the laughter and the tears . " Her name is Claire . " That night he sat down and wrote a letter . " Darling Claire , On this the day , almost the hour of your birth , I want to tell you how I feel beforeany of my thoughts can slip away . We do n't know each other yet , but already you are part of me , like my hand or my eyes . I would n't have believed it possible . I love you so . . . " RANDOM WINDS I11Chapter10Sometimes Fern thought of the bed as a kind of throne , raised as it was on a shallow platform in the middle of the long wall . Everyone came to her here , where she leaned against fresh white linen pillows under a canopy upheld by carved mahogany posts . Neddie and Emmy climbed up to be read to ; the baby Isabel was placed here in her arms to be fed . Alex had said , " I read once that home is where the furniture has stood in one place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind moving into a house that was finished long ago by other people ? " She had not minded , as long as she could have her books from home : art books , history , poetry and books her mother had read to her when she was a child . They all stood now on shelves in the yellow sitting room across the hall . Everything else in Lamb House had been there before her , except for the bed . She had not wanted to lie with her husband in the bed where his parents had conceived him . So the original had been taken down and stored away . In a London antique shop she had found a replacement almost like the first , but without any personal , known history and therefore , new . Sometimes she thought of the bed as a ship , a great safe ship floating all night on a quiet sea until morning . Waking early , she would open her eyes in the familiar haven of the lovely room , into which first light shook itself through white , trembling curtains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And for a few minutes she would lie quite still , feeling that fine brightness of the spirit , that tranquility of the flesh , which is called , for lack of any more apt definition , " well-being . " But all this was of the past . For months now , she had lain most of the time alone in the bed , on sheets gone cold and pillows crumpled by her restless , sleepless head . Alex slept on a narrow cot in the dressing room next door . He had first begun to sleep there during the winter when he 'd had the flu . Its aftermathof coughing had lasted for weeks . Then , in order not to wake Fern after late meetings in town , he had kept on using the cot . . . She was finding it impossible to talk about . That was puzzling , becauseAlex and she had been able to talk about anything . Women in particular had often remarked , with some curiosity and much frank envy , on this free and lively interchange of theirs . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a husband !

She was perfectly aware that this was only false pride and a wife ought not to have false pride . Yet she had it . One day she bought a book about married love and left it on the table at the foot of the bed , next to the folded London Times . Alex riffled through it and put it back . " Good Lord , " he said , " you 'd think people never could have got married and lived together without having somebody write a book of instructions for them ! " The remark was so unlike him , to whom open-mindedness and intellectualcuriosity were essential virtues , that Fern was astonished and said so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And she , rebuked and made foolish , said no more . " By the way . " He lowered the paper a few minutes later . " At the Baker 's dinner Malcolm said you were the most striking woman in the room .

Had a meeting about the blasted German insurance today . Terrence made the report and you know how long-winded he can be . If you want to read some more , I 'll sleep in the dressing room . " " I do n't want to read anymore , " she said flatly . The darkness had a hollow feel , as if she were alone in a cavern . How could everything have changed so quickly ?

She willed him to turn back to her , but her will had no effect . Yet , if he had turned and opened his arms , she would not have come into them . For was she to exist only to satisfy his odd whim ? What could he be thinking of ? And did n't he wonder at all what she might be thinking ? Rain spattered the leaves close to the windows . Rain again ! No wonderthe English drank so much brandy and so much boiling tea ! The dampness shuddered in her marrow . She got up to take another blanket and lay wide awake while the rain quickened and darkness deepened in the hollow cavern . There was another woman : there had to be . Who , then ? That cousin of Nora 's , she of the false voice , chirrup and chirp ? She had a very convenientflat in London . Maybe even Nora herself ? Shameful to think of one 's friend ; kind , strong Nora . Still , one never knew ; one heard incrediblethings . That Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the horse show ? She was dark and the women he admired were always dark ones . The girl could n't be more than eighteen . She had the most absurd way of stretching her eyes , slanting them up at a man even when he was no taller than she . Alex had danced with her at least five times at the Elliot 's . Maybe it was none of these at all . Maybe it was someone he had known before they were married , some woman he could n't have married , because she would n't have been a proper mother for his child . She must find out . She would find out . Alex sighed in his sleep and turned over ; one relaxed arm brushed Fern 's rigid shoulder . He smelled of cleanliness , of shaving lotion and Pear 's soap . And she slid away , out of touch . Her mind sped . He 'd gone riding with Delia last Thursday afternoon . They were out two hours , at least . She would have gone , too , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errands in the village he had alreadyleft . And when she went down to the stable to saddle Duchess , they were just coming in . " We went all the way to Blackdale . It was marvelous ! " Delia cried . " You should have been with us , Fern . " " Yes , I should . " Her hair falls like black silk . . . It 's not possible . Things like this happen to other people . Like auto accidents and cancer , they happen to other people . On a Sunday afternoon in dark and threatening autumn weather , Alex stood up suddenly and stretched . " I 've a yen for exercise . I think I 'll take Lion for a canter up to Blackdale . Not far . " " Not far ! An hour and a half there and back . And it 's going to rain . " She knew she sounded critical and cross . But he answered pleasantly . " I 'll be home before the rain comes , I think . And if not , I sha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've no wish to get soaked . " " Should n't want you to , " he said , still pleasantly . He had been gone half an hour before her thoughts took clear shape , and a decision was made . What sort of fool did he take her for ? A country canter in this weather ? And he 'd been on the telephone three times before lunch today . From the closet she pulled a mackintosh and rain hat , for the rain had begun . Then she went into the hall and called softly up the stairs . " Nanny ? Let the children have tea without us this afternoon . I 've an unexpected errand . " She would be waiting for them at the stable , standing in the lane as they rode up . She would smile , smile dangerously , and then see what Alex would have to say . But afterward  --  what would come then ? She could n't think that far ahead . Vague images of daring courage came to mind : of those men who last summer had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Himalayas . The vertigo ! The horror of falling ! Could they have felt such panic in the pit of the stomach ? No . They would n't have been able to do it if they had . Step forward . Get through it . The rest will follow . She walked swiftly . There was no one on the road , the villagers being either at the radio or sleeping Sunday dinner off . Even the clattering crows of autumn had taken shelter from the wet . The fools ! They would be soaked ! Unless they knew of some place to hide away in  --  she could n't imagine where . There was no one about in the stable yard , either . The horses had all been taken indoors . From the little office next to the tack room where Kevin , the head groom , had a desk and kept his records , came an oil lamp 's weak glow . It would n't do any harm to wait inside with Kevin .

Something caught Fern 's attention before her hand had turned the knob . A cot , covered with a plaid horse blanket , stood opposite the desk along the farther wall . Someone was lying on it . She leaned forward. 114 THE WEBBlinked . Stepped back . Leaned forward again . Frowning , she flattened her nose on the wet glass . It was like looking into an aquarium . The shape on the cot  --  no , there were two  --  the shapes slid , pale and slippery , like great , gliding fish , underwater creatures twisted in some unfathomableembrace . And for a minute or two she stood there , failing to understand . She saw , yet did not grasp the meaning of what she saw . Then a face came into view . It moved into the path of the lamplight . It was a face and a bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She saw a flash of naked white as Kevin sat up . And she understood . She gave a harsh cry and clapped her palm to her mouth and fled from the shaft of light into the shrubbery . She heard Alex crying , in a voice of terrible alarm , " Who 's there ? Who 's there ? " And she ran . Crouched and stumbling in the failing afternoon , under a sky grown eerie as moonlight , she ran , hidden from the public road behind hedges and walls . A bramble ripped her leg . She fell . Pebbles ground into her palms . She had a crazy thought that someone was pursuing her . " Oh my God ! " she gasped . Her heart beat so ! It beat so ! And she put her hand to her chest . Was there some stoppage there ? Even at her age , the heart could stop , could n't it ? She reached the house and banged the door open . A child , hearing her steps , called from upstairs , but she raced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat upon the floor and lay down upon the bed . Her throne ! Her ship ! She was dizzy , sick , delirious . It was all unreal ! Untrue ! She had not seen , could not possibly have seen it ! Yes , she knew of such things , but very vaguely , for there was nothing in print except for some sparse definitions in the dictionaries . A girl in school had overheard her brother talking . There had been tittering , shocked laughter , so that dimly and half-comprehended , a conception of something awful and unnatural had been formed . She had been perhapsfifteen when these things had happened . And she knew now very little more than she had known then . If only her heart would stop pounding so ! It felt as though a volcano were swirling and burning in her , as if she were too full to contain the swirling and burning . Downstairs the front door opened and then was closed with the muffled thud of solid wood . Footsteps sounded : Alex 's familiar tread . He came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was you , " he said softly . Fern 's dry , scared eyes stared up at him . " Well , now you know . " She kept on staring at him . He looked the same . The strong shouldersRANDOM WINDS 115in the handsome riding jacket , the humorous tilt to the eyes , were the same . " Why ? " she whispered . He shook his head . He sighed . " I 'm sorry . Oh God , I 'm sorry . " New terror passed over her , a terror like the cold wind of abandonment . She was alone . Alex was not Alex anymore . Then who was there ? " I thought it was Delia , " she whispered . How much better if it had been Delia , after all ! " You thought it was Delia ? That rattle-headed , empty fool ? " He laughed . There was no mirth in the laugh ; it was only bitter , nervous , agitated . But the sound of it , and the look of his easy stance , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the jacket pocket , were too much . Everything burst in Fern . Everything that had been held back for months , added now to this , burst open in one long , wild , frenzied scream . It rose and filled the room ; it emptied out into the dusk . " Stop it ! Stop it , Fern , stop it ! " Alex cried . She was n't able to . Her mind was working clearly ; she understood that this was hysteria , her first experience of it . What she had read of it was true . You slid down and down and down , hearing from some fat distance your own appalling screams . Over the edge you went , over the edge . She struggled for air . And struggling up , she ran to the window to push the casement wide . Alex , misinterpreting , pulled her back and pinned her on the bed . " You fool ! I 'm not worth killing yourself for ! " He opened her collar . " Quiet ! Quiet ! Whatever 's happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People can hear you . " She wept now , beating the bed with her palms . " I do n't care who hears ! Let them ! " " You 'll terrify the children . You care about them , do n't you ? " The children ! Ah yes , the children ! And this , their father . " Take some , " Alex said . A decanter and small green glass for his nightcap stood on the tray . He filled the glass . " Take some , " he commandedagain . She twisted away . " Do n't put your hands on me ! " " All right . All right . But talk to me . Please talk to me ! " Silently now , her thick tears rolled as smooth as glycerine . " I know you ca n't understand . I ca n't expect you to be anything but horrified .

" i16 THE WEB RANDOM WINDS 117She thought , I ca n't stay here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just walking out , leaving everything behind  --  this house , the children , her pictures  --  and most of all this loathsome man . She saw the strapped trunks and the suitcases waiting in the hall . On the top of the pile lay the patent leather traveling case which had come with her from home . The car waited in the driveway . Neddie , Isabel and Emmy stood at the foot of the stairs , their bewildered eyes asking why she was leaving them . Alex was speaking softly , soothingly . " At least , though , you must see that Kevin 's no threat to the marriage , as Delia would have been . " " Threat to the marriage ? What marriage ? If I could walk out tonight , just walk down the road in the mud ; if there were a train going out , a train to anywhere , I do n't care where , I 'd go . I 'd go this minute . " " You 're forgetting something . " " Forgetting ? " " Your children  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Alex shook his head . " No , " he said . " No . " In the straight-backed chair beside the bed he sat erect , as if in the saddle , except that one knee was crossed high on the other thigh . This easy posture alarmed her , as she recognized something she had seen before , although it had never yet been directed at her . It was an iron will , in casual disguise . It was determination , not to be diverted . " What do you mean ? You 're not fit ! Do you think you 're a fit father to rear a family ? Why , any court would  --  " " Any court would if any court could . But it would be your word against mine . Whose do you think they would believe ?

There has to be a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilized country . " Alex held up his hand . " Wait . And if you were able to prove it  --  you would n't be , but for the sake of argument , let 's say you could  --  then of course , this being a civilized country , I would be relieved of my post . How do you think we should all live then ? If you have any idea that inherited wealth alone supports us , you 're terribly mistaken . You know very well what 's happened to investments here since the crash in America . I need to work , Fern . Keep that in mind , if you care about your children . " " Then I 'll simply take them and go , that 's all . You ca n't very well set a guard over us whenever you 're out of the house . " He raised his eyebrows . " Where will you go ?

Everything , everything about you , your voice , and the quietness in you , and all the life . . . You think like me . We go so well together . I wanted it to be so good for us .

" " You have no right ! You 've forfeited the right . " " It 's the point of view , " Alex said , bringing himself under control . " Society 's point of view . In the society of ancient Greece , if you were living there , you would see this differently . " " I 'm not living in ancient Greece . " " Well but , listen to me , I 'm a good father .

A shudder rippled down Fern 's back and contorted her face . Her teeth began to chatter . " When you 're more calm in the morning , I 'll explain to you  --  " " I do n't want explanations , " she cried . " Just get out ! Get out where I do n't have to look at you . Get out !

She remembered a hot beach in Florida years before , walking on the sand with her mother and Jessie , picking up shells . How good to be so young , to know nothing !

She would be appalled to see them in the mirror , and at the sight of her own stricken face the tears would start again . What am I going to do ? she thought . The door opened . Past the window the black had turned to gray . She could see him as he approached the bed , and she stiffened . He was still dressed except for his boots and the coat of his riding habit . Like her , he had been awake all that long night . " Fern , ca n't we even try to be reasonable about this ? " " Reasonable ! " she cried scornfully . " You really like that word , do n't you ? " " It 's a good word , one of the best . " She did n't answer . She felt hopeless , burnt out . " I 'll fix a room across the hall . I 'll spend more time in town . I should anyway .

You 've even been in their homes . Why , I could tell you  --  " " I do n't want to hear ! " And on the icy tiles she knelt down , something she had not done in years , not since passing through the religiosity of early adolescence . Yes , once since then , on the night her mother died , she had knelt and prayed : God help me , please . So now on her knees she murmured again : God help me , please . But she had been reared in a household of sceptics , and nothing moved inside . When she realized that Alex was standing there watching , she struggled to her feet . " You find this theatrical , I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on occasion . " " And did it help ? " RANDOM WINDS 119She picked up the bathroom glass and threw it at him . Falling short , it smashed on the floor , scattering its pointed shards with a tinkle . " Damn you , " she cried , " get out ! Get out of my sight ! " When he had gone , she got down again on her knees in the splintered glass and cried and longed to be dead . Alex 's mother , accepting a second portion of pudding , remarked , " I 'm so sorry to have missed Alex . If I had known he was going to be busy in town all week , I 'd have postponed my visit . " The women sat together at one end of the long table . The three days ' visit had been interminable for Fern . Ordinarily it would not have been hard to endure , for by now she was used to Rosamund . ( Such an odd name for this woman ! " Rosamund " should be young and careless ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in youth . ) But she was far too desperate to cope with small talk , although she made the effort . " You 'll stay for dinner , wo n't you ? We 'll have it early . You 'll have plenty of time to catch the evening train . " " No , I 'll take the five o'clock . Thanks anyway . I 'll be back next month for Neddie 's birthday , though . " By next month , Fern thought , it may all have been too much . PerhapsI shall have fallen apart by then . Ca n't you see what 's happening ? Rosamund whispered , " Fern , you 're not expecting again ? You do n't mind my asking ? But you do look a little peaked . " " Oh no , no I 'm not . " Rosamund laid her hand on Fern 's arm . The heat of her hand came through the woolen sleeve . Her warm breath smelled of minted mouthwash . " I used to envy my friends who had daughters . I used to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you know , I do n't say it anymore , not since I 've had my daughter-in-law . In this slipshod , **27;7750;TOOLONG , I can rely on you . You 're so good to me ! I tell everyone . " This undeserved , pathetic praise caused disquiet in Fern . What had she ever given , after all , to this poor woman , so hungry for affection ? Visits and presents , perfunctory , expensive knickknacks that one picked up without effort or thought . " Fern , will you come up while I pack my suitcase ? There are some things I want to show you . " In the few days of her occupancy Rosamund had made the room her own . There was a clutter of magazines on the bedside table next to a photograph of Alex 's father . On the round table in the bay window lay an elaborate , interrupted game of double solitaire , and this last spoke toI20 THE WEB RANDOM WINDS 121Fern . As Rosamund gathered up the cards , it spoke of Jessie , of long evenings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rosamund said now , " I 've been making a surprisefor you . I thought you might like this . " And she placed on Fern 's lap a heavy picture album covered in dark blue velvet , embroidered in silver thread : Alexander Lamb V. " I 'd intended to keep it for your Christmas present , but I 'm too impatient to wait that long . " Fern turned the pages . There was Alex at three months , lying naked on a fur rug . Here he sat in a high chair , there in a rowboat . Wearing an Eton jacket , he stood between his parents . " Smile ! " the photographer had commanded and Alex had smiled . The label read , " First Day at School . " Here , some years later , he was on the soccer team . " Can you tell which one was Alex ? " and as Fern pointed to the wrong one , " I thought you would n't be able to tell ! Was n't he chubby ? But he has such a large frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the meals you serve .

" I 've been meaning to give you these , and now is as good a time as any . That 's my mother 's garnet bracelet . It 's eighteen carat . Not that I 'm boasting , but so much Victorianjewelry is n't real gold , so I thought you ought to know . And my ruby ring . Try it on . It 'll fit your little finger . " Fern was frightened .

The ruby 's small , but it happens to be flawless . I was always so proud of it . " " I do n't know what to say , " Fern began . People who trusted you , who were good to you , controlled you . You were helpless before them . This woman expected to be loved . She assumed that her son was deeply loved . She weighed you down .

My husband was so generous toward me ! They 're good men , the Lambs . We 're lucky , you and I. Alex is a one-woman man like his father . You 'll never have to worry the way so many do these days . And did even in my time , too ; oh , yes , they did ! What some of my friends put up with ! Because of pride , of course , and also for the children 's sake . What 's a woman to do ?

" " Why , my dear , you are softhearted , are n't you ? " Rosamund was pleased . " Just enjoy them . I 'm so sorry I missed Alex . Kiss him for me . " She thought , rushing down the hall , that she would n't be able to stand much more . There had to be someone she could talk to . Someone . She longed for her mother . It was humiliating that , at this age and herself a mother , she should feel such need . If only her father were a man one could go to ! But you could never talk to him of interior things .

Perhapsalienation was n't the right word ; indifference might be a better definition . Or unease ? Whatever the term , things were as they were . Since the birth of her child , Jessie had drawn farther away . Within the real world she had made another world into which few were admittedand these mostly old people , or women who , because they were dowdy or scholarly or both , were no threat to Jessie . Fern saw this clearly , pityingly . And she wondered what place Martin had in that lit-122 THE WEBtle world . Her mind , opening the door of his and Jessie 's bedroom , retreatedin shame and closed the door at once . So she could n't go to her sister .

Who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question and denied the answer  --  because the meeting would be awkward at best and probably futile as well . She knew nevertheless that the answer was Martin . Why ? There was a subtle coolness between them . She still felt discomfort in his presence , although not what she had felt when he first arrived in England . Certainly she was n't angry anymore . She had made herself behave like a mature , accepting woman . Perhaps , she reasoned , Alex had been right . People looked for different things in marriage and , after all , theirs was not the first such marriage . Martin was most tender with Jessie . And quite mad about the little girl ! A lovely child , she was . A firebird . Quicksilver . Curiously , she reminded one of Neddie . Emmy and Isabel would be large , placid women , easy to live with .

But she herself had changed since then ! One could call it learning or aging . No matter . But Martin was kind ; that had n't altered . He would surely listen to her . He could be trusted . Maybe he would even know some way to help her . Was there any help ? A coal fire burned in the grate . The walls were covered with black and brown books bound in frayed and powdering leather .

On the desk there was an open folderRANDOM WINDS 123with a pen beside it . But Martin had written nothing and said nothing , only listened . Now he said , " You were beginning to smile a moment ago . Why ? " " For some reason or other , I was remembering the day you told me my eyes do n't belong in my face . " He did n't answer .

" " Your feelings . Were they true ? " " Yes , yes . I do n't know . " These last weeks she had grown thinner , and her rings were loose . She twisted them . She faltered : " If you had asked me before all this , I would have said , Yes , I loved him . ' Now I think it 's possible I thought so because I did n't know what I was missing .

" " You 've no right to say that ! " she cried , in immediate anger . " Why have n't I ? I 'm a doctor . You asked for my opinion . " " That does n't give you the right to humiliate people .

You 're hurt because your life 's been turned inside out . " She wanted to slap him . In her need she had come to him for aid and comfort ; he was giving her a scolding and scorn . Tears started . Biting her lip , she controlled them . He stood up again and went to rearrange some books on a table . He was strangely agitated . Then he came back and sat down . " I 'm sorry . I 'm not being fair to you . I sounded angry , I know . " " Yes , you did . Why ? " " I do n't know why . One does n't always understand oneself .

" That certainly is n't all one gets married for . " " People marry for many reasons . Because they 're lonely , or need a particular kind of understanding or a companionable mind . Many rea-sons .

Take one only if you need it badly . " " I sha n't kill myself , you know ! " " If I thought you had such an idea , I would n't give them to you at all .

" He might have been expected to say , " Come back anytimeif you need me again , " but he did not , and so she repeated her thanks with a correctness to match his own , and went out . On the rattling suburban train , she fell asleep . She had always been one of those rare , contrary souls for whom sleep in time of trouble was a psychological escape , and there would be no need for pills .

Alex , coming upstairs a moment later , knocked on the frame of the open door . " May I ? " " Yes , come in. " 128 THE WEBThey faced each other , Fern at the closet where she had been hangingup her coat , he in the doorway . Then , astoundingly , he said , " You 've seen Martin . " " What ?

" I only meant , you do n't know him well enough , do you , to feel much of anythingtoward him ? " " I told you I can sense things . I judge people very quickly . For instance , I know that he 's in love with you . I 've known it for a long time . He 's the man you should have married . " " Do n't be absurd !

" Well , it 's true . " She turned away . " I 've got to get this hot dress off . It 's miserable . " In the dressing room she put on a robe . That pain again , the little pulses in her temples ! She touched them lightly . He ought n't to have said that about Martin ! There were enough terrible things for her to think about already without adding more . She had mountains to climb ! Mountains ! And anyway it was n't true ! Martin was responsible and serious ; he would n't  --  Suddenly , involuntarily , she gave a little cry . " Are you all right ? " Alex called . She came back to the bedroom and sat down . " It 's been a hard day , and I 'm worn out . " He knelt on the floor and took her hand . " Fern , I 'll be the best friend you ever could have . " He moved his cheek until it rested on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She wanted to draw away , yet did not ; they sat unmoving through an expectant silence . At last Alex raised his head .

I do n't ever want you to think that I  --  that what I am has anything to do with you . It 's just me . " Silence again . " It did n't work with Susannah . But then , she was a sharp-tongued bitch , and I thought it might have been partly her fault . I hoped it would be different with you . And I tried , Fern , you know I did .

It was as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at herself , who would have to endure a purgatory of fruitless , unending analysis , while anger and pain would slowly evaporate like salt in the sun , leaving  --  leaving what ?

" And there was a boy in school . Lewis was his name . He sat at the next desk . He also had brown hands and thick , beautiful hair .

And the girl I was with "  --  now Alex was almost whispering  --  " the girl laughed because I  --  I did n't want to . She laughed . And the news got around when we were back at school . It was a huge , splendid joke ! Except for Lewis . He came to me , and we talked . He was so fine , so decent , so different from the others . . . He became my only friend , and I was his . In a way you might say we suffered together . " He looked down at his hands , turning them over and back , as if they could offer him some explanation . " There are memories , so minute and sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have been . A burly ruffian with hairy ears130 THE WEBand a shattering voice , saying , Alex pees sitting down . ' Why is n't it possible to forget things like that ? Why should a boor 's taunt have power to torment you a quarter of a lifetime later ? " So that 's the way it is , Fern thought . She had not wanted to be so moved . She had wanted to keep the hard anger , to hold the insult which had been dealt her , to hold them both fast and neither weaken nor give in . But give in to what ? In these few minutes , night had come , and from the triangle of sky that filled the upper corner of the window , there poured an iridescent afterglow . It fell upon the man 's bowed head . Feeling her gaze , he looked up . " Fern , everything I have belongs to you and the children . I do n't mean just things , this house or money . I mean caring . My devotion . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go on just quietly being what I am , you know . But I 'll never ask what you do with private portions of your life . I 'll never ask . " So we could live here , could n't we , with our children , and be happy in other ways ? " " Happy ! " she cried silently . And Alex repeated , " Could n't we ? " In the simplicity of the words and in his face she saw , not so much a plea for pity and understanding , as a kind of wonder that they two were here like this , having learned what they both now knew . That much she saw , and also she saw disbelief , as when a man has been wounded , so she had read , and stares at the shattering , not able to believe that he is himself and the wound belongs to him . Then pity came , after all , and she bent down to rest his head against her shoulder , rocking and swaying as if he were a child and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , panicked and lost , and he her comforter . Or as if he and she , strangers just met , survivors of some awful cataclysm , some rage of nature , avalanche or quake or firestorm , must cling together out of need and then , because of common humanity and common trust , must stay . Chapter11No self-respecting institution at home would have put up with so ancienta building , Martin reflected , as he prepared to leave for the afternoon . In America this would have been torn down , or more probably abandoned for a new building in a newer part of the city . These steps on which he stood to regard the blossoming day had been laid down in the eighteenth century . The wings to right and left of the central structurewere Victorian , darkly bulbous , with beetling fenestration . It amused him to imagine that they looked like the women of their era , stout in bombazine and bustles . " Making your plans for the day ? " Mr. Meredith drew on gloves and tucked his umbrella under one arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park with Claire . " " Taking a bus ? " " Later . I want to walk a little before I catch it . " " Fine . I 'll go part way with you . " Through speckled sunlight and shade under the lime trees , they fell into step . Each man was sturdy with well-being and aware that the other was the same . A small boy came galloping with an enormous borzoion a leash . A young woman in a petal yellow suit came out of a house , carrying a sheaf of tulips wrapped in green tissue paper . " Splendid weather , " Meredith remarked with a sigh of pleasure . Martin said , " I ca n't believe I 've been here three years . " " Does it seem longer to you or shorter ? " " That depends on mood . Longer or shorter , it 's been wonderful . It 's opened worlds for me. " 134 PASSAGES RANDOM WINDS 135 " I must say you 've taken good advantage of it .

" " I would n't miss it . Dr. Eastman 's coming over from New York and I 'll have a chance to see him again . " " Have I congratulated you on your association with him ? Great fortunefor you . " " I 'm indebted to Mr. Braidbum forever . After all , when Eastman wrote that he was looking for a new man , Mr. Braidburn could have recommended any one of half a dozen others , and I know it . " " What have you been offered , may I ask ? Full-time association ? " " Yes , on a trial basis , naturally . If things work out well , why then it will become permanent . " Martin 's voice trailed off . The whole prospect had an air of unreality . Everything had gone so smoothly , one deliberatestep after the other . " You 've got just two months more , have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country with us before you leave . Well , I turn off here . Enjoy your afternoon . " Glancing after him , Martin thought : Funny , in the beginning , the formalmanners , the bowler hats and accents put me off . He smiled , recallingsome of those first impressions . They had taught him much , those men : Meredith , Braidbum , Llewellynand the rest . All those dark winter afternoons under electric lights in the pathology lab ! Those early mornings watching Braidburn in the O.R. ! And the lunchtime discussions on clinical neurology ; the diagramsdrawn on the backs of menus ; the questions ; the arguments ! Yes , he would take good memories back with him . From the top of the double-decker bus , he enjoyed the panorama of the city . How the northerners of this foggy little island worshiped the sun ! This was the first real warmth of the season today and here they were already , stretched out wherever there was a plot of grass , turning their pale faces to the light . Here came the Victoria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had a glimpse of a deerhound on a stone frieze , pursued by men wearing classical togas . Absurd ! A large stone lady perched on a kneeling elephant ; an elaborate necklace fell between her naked , spherical breasts , and that was absurd , too . But the breasts were exquisite . He stared at them until they were out of sight . Now came the turn into Kensington High Street and a few blocks to walk home . He got off and began to hurry . Claire was dressed and waiting for him . They started for the park , she riding ahead of him on her tricycle , jangling its bell . Her dark curlsjust touched the velvet collar of her tiny coat . Jessie dressed her in fine taste , but then , Jessie 's taste was always fine . He could n't take his eyes from Claire . And he wondered whether she would ever have any comprehensionat all of what she meant to him . Her bright voice , her vigor ! There was such a softness in him ! That nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ever hurt her ! And although he knew that this cherishing of a child was the most universal emotion known to man , still it seemed to him , no doubt foolishly , that what he felt must be unusually intense . How irrational life could be ! Now , with the way lying clear before him to support a family , he could have but one child . Alice had sent snapshots of her three , the girls not nearly as pretty as Claire . Fred taught at a village school in the potato country ; it must be a struggle for them . Yet Alice was about to have another child . Once in the park , past the Round Pond and the ducks in the Serpentine , Martin led the way to the statue of Peter Pan . ( He had read the story to Claire ; Jessie said it was too advanced for a three-year-old , yet he was sure she had understood it . ) And , finding a bench , he settled down to watch Claire riding back and forth on the path . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fashion magazine . Lanky and lean , the models posed smartly with arched back , thrusting pelvis and long , striding legs . Their purpose was ostensibly to seem indifferent and aloof . Yet sexual invitation was written on their lovely , haughty faces . Under a spreading bush a couple lay in uninhibited embrace for anyoneto see . And it was said that the English were " cold " ! Martin breathed deeply . A tart , bitter fragrance blew from behind him : out of dark earth had come an explosion of huge geraniums , blazingand blooming like none he had ever seen at home . And these also were sexual in their exuberance . Primeval , burgeoning spring ! Fragrance and moisture of new life , bursting , reaching , wanting . Wanting so ! Until it  --  it hurt ! He became aware of his heartbeat . It happens now and then : you hear your own heartbeat and suddenly , for no reason that you can explain to yourself , you are reminded that someday it will stop . The sturdy , steady heart will flutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come a final beat . And the amazing little pump , which has been serving without an instant 's rest for all your years , will halt . And now the old , familiar melancholy seeped in Martin : the veil , the cloud over the sun , the shade drawn down on the day which had been so blithe and charming up till a moment ago . And he remembered that this melancholy had been lying upon him for many months past. 136 PASSAGESThere had been such cheer when Claire was born ! So much purpose and joy ! What had happened to them ? And when ? But it was impossible to set a time , to say " There , that 's the moment we began to be unhappy . " Back in Cyprus it had seemed remarkable that Jessie could be possessedof such practical good humor , so much realistic common sense , such strong optimism . " Wholesome " had been his word for her then , often a priggish word when misused , but actually a fine one , meaning " healthy " and " whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? There had been " scenes .

A new ballerina had been dancing , an exquisite girl who was being talked of all over the Continent . A dream of a girl  --  unforgettable . Her dark red hair , caught in a tail , fell tossing to her shoulders . She rose en pointe , her white arms reaching in a perfect curve , her mauve skirt drifting  --  Splendor and grace to catch at one 's throat in awe and linger , smiling , on one 's lips ! And all the while Jessie had been watching , not the dance , but him . Coming into the bedroom later that night , he had caught her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had turned on him furiously . " Why do n't you knock ? Do you have to come in here to stare at me ? " " I was n't staring at you ! But for Heaven 's sake , I 'll look away if you want me to . " " Yes , do ! It 's a lot more pleasant for you to look at anyone else but me , I 'm sure it is . Ballerinas , waitresses  --  almost anyone but me . " Wanting to be patient , he had yet said the wrong thing . " Jessie , ca n't you try not to think about yourself ? Other people really do n't pay all that much attention to your  --  " " To my what ? " " Your  --  disability . " " You ca n't say it , can you ? " " Say what ? " " Hump ! " she cried . " I can say it well enough ! H-U-M-P . Hump . Go on . Say it !

I want to help you , Jessie , " he said gently . So he had tried and in the end , when she had exhausted anger , she had apologized , in shame . " Oh , you are patient with me , Martin , I know you are ! I ought to be grateful for what I 've got , and I really am . It 's just that when we 're out together  --  you have no idea how I steel myself to go places with you ! I feel the thoughts in the air , the messages passed from one to the other . And I know what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will talk on the telephone the next morning . " For a week or two after that particular time they had gone nowhere , except on Sunday to a country inn where they had sat on a high-backed settle near a fire and watched the locals play Shove Ha'penny . No one had paid any attention to them . For those few hours it had been as it was when they rode around Cyprus on house calls , talking about the state of medicine and everything else under the sun . He understood now that these things had interested Jessie because she could hide behind them : they were not about her . But she could n't hide in anonymousplaces forever . She must know that . Could he ever think of her as other than a poor bird with a broken wing ? Her strength had been deceptive : the bird could flutter bravely in the cage but the wide world frightened it . Then his mind closed , unwilling to confront yet another analysis . He looked for Claire . She was safely pedaling down the walk , her short legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was a handsome one , last year 's Christmas gift from Jessie . She was always buying things for him , caring about his clothes  --  he himself cared almost nothing about clothes  --  seeing to it that there were books on his night table , making plans for the office he would have . Next year at Christmasthey would be in New York and he would be earning . He would have to find some splendid present for her , something , even , that he could n't afford . A ring ? She had slender fingers . A sapphire ? Now memory made one of its implausible and senseless associations . Mary wore rings . Mary still wore that curiously fashioned topaz ring . Only a few weeks ago , coming home earlier than usual , he found that she had dropped in for tea , something she had n't done in half a year or more . She had risen as soon after Martin 's entrance as decent manners would allow . He had been aware of that . Every nerve in him had been aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the topaz ring. 138 PASSAGESWhite lilacs circled the brim of her straw hat . Her shoes were delicate . He had seen that her eyes avoided him , looking past him toward the wall , or resting on her hand , the one with the ring , which lay on the arm of the chair . He concluded that she was embarrassed before him . People often were after they had revealed their intimate miseries . He had only seen her perhaps six times since that day , more than a year ago , when she had sat before him and told , with more dignity than most women would have been able to muster , the story of wreckage . He had , for a bad few moments , been harsh with her that day ; for some reason he had wanted to hurt her ; and at once he had been terribly ashamed and tried to make amends . He hoped he had made them adequately . There had been no way to find out , or to find out how she was faring at all . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , everything looked handsome enough , with a patina of wealth and charm and family unity . " Fern would never get a divorce , " Jessie had remarked once , a long time ago . " It would shatter her image of perfection . " But that was n't true . She would have got one if she could have . And he wondered about many things : whether Alex had any idea how much he , Martin , knew of the Lambs ' affairs ; whether Mary had someone else by now ; whether she lay alone at night and how troubled she might be because of itSurprising , though , how one could get used to being " alone . " He had thought of himself , and indeed had been , a man with strong and frequentsexual needs . Yet now a very little went a long way .

Mary , in Braidburn 's office , struggling against tears . Mary , proudly pregnant , standing at the door of Lamb House . Mary , in Cyprus , painting three scarlet birds on a wire fence . Fantasies ! Soon , if he did n't curb them , he would become obsessed by them again as once he had been . Foreboding and alarm began to flutter in him now . It was humiliating not to be able to direct his mind at will . . . Claire climbed up on the bench between him and a proper British nurse who was tending a baby in a perambulator .

" We 'll read about him , then . " When he had finished , she went back to the tricycle . " That 's a bright little girl , sir , " the nurse remarked . " Thank you . " " A child with spirit .

" You 'll be going back to America soon , I hear . " " Yes . In the fall . " He corrected himself . " The autumn . " " I expect you 'll be happy to go home . " " Yes , home is always best , is n't it ? " Martin answered tritely . The sky was what one called " mackerel , " spotted and clouding over toward a sudden English shower . He stood up and called to Claire . Holding the child 's hand , he guided the tricycle across the street . " Home is best , " he had said . Yet here he had had perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown farthest and swiftest toward what he wanted to be . " Why do n't you stay in London ? " people often asked . For it was a civilized place . Always he would remember its moist , foggy air and its mild light lying on greenery and gray stone . New York , on the other hand , was aggressive . The searing summers drained your strength . The tearing February wind , blowing off the rivers , was fierce enough to spin you around in your tracks . And all the time , one was battered by noise of traffic and hammering rivets .
