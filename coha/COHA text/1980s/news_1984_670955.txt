The resort season is in full swing on Seventh Avenue , and it promises to be a season of contrasts. // These are warm-weather clothes , geared for the mild weather of the Sun Belt , for the women who live and work there as well as those who visit on midwinter vacations . So there are play clothes , to wear around the pool or at the beach , dressy styles for dinners under moonlit skies and classic blazers and trousers , useful at any time or place. // Ralph Lauren , as usual , favors the classics . His are timeless styles in linen , suede and cashmere that avoid the trendy and have an inborn sense of elegance , a word that is not bandied about much these days in fashion circles . His clothes were presented at a series of informal shows in his Seventh avenue showroom in what he called his " Palm Beach room , " an environment consisting of a lot of fronds and a rattan sofa. // <> <> Long-Lasting Appeal // The white linen shirts and pants , pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and appropriate in the setting . Without going in for histrionics of any kind , Mr. Lauren showed clothes that will be as useful next year or five years from now as today . They have style as well as elegance , and his presentation was a class act. // So was the Anne Klein presentation of clothes by Donna Karan and Louis Dell ' Olio . Somewhat more extensive in scope than the Lauren collection , with more colors and prints , the collection has a similar sense of enduring style . The blazer is a key element . With it go long shorts and long skirts , linen T-shirts and linen shirts . It is shown in prints and solid colors and it looks most practical in cotton chino , to be paired with separates in chino or almost anything else . One attractive combination consists of a long , widely flaring chino skirt , matching jacket and white linen shirt. // The sweaters , with their crunchy three-dimensional surfaces , are an alternative to jackets . They also come in patterns or solid colors . Proving once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linen shirt , long linen skirt and white sleeveless sweater has a strong sense of glamour. // Jumpsuits , linen T-shirts , chambray and foulard-pattern silk separates all have their place in the sun. // Resort showings tend to be less awesome than the presentation of fall and winter clothes , which generally constitute the biggest season for most fashion houses . Most take place in the company ' s showroom rather than in hotel ballrooms or restaurants , providing an opportunity to see the clothes up close and even touch the material , an age-old Seventh Avenue tradition . But there are exceptions. // <> <> Designs for Film and TV // One was the introduction of Bob Mackie ' s collection in the auditorium of the Parsons School of Design . No stranger to warm weather clothes , Mr. Mackie works in Los Angeles , where he designs for film and television as well as private lives . The theatrical flair shows. // He chose a circus theme , carrying it out in colors so strong they seem to vibrate , with harlequin details , ruffled cancan dresses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trompe l ' oeil zebras on the sleeves of a short black jacket . There was even a bearded lady in a jeweled crepe dress , but that seemed to be carrying androgyny too far. // In between , there were plenty of beaded dresses , a Mackie signature , as well as some more casual sweaters with red hearts knitted into them . Everybody enjoyed the oom-pah-pah of the circus music as well as the glitz . Annabel Nichols , Mike Nichols ' s wife , echoed the sentiments of many observers when she murmured at the end , " Beautiful clothes . " It was the most ambitious of the week ' s presentations. // Bill Haire recalled his introduction of his " high-powered color palette " for sportswear just two years ago . His colors are still stronger than most , but they are just a bit muted . Crushed raspberry and chartreuse with mustard overtones are examples . Easy shirts with curved shirttails dipping longer in back , scribble prints and sweaters patterned with the faces of the models Liz Lee and Liz Brown , are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like computer printouts , were made from Xerox enlargements of photographs of the models. // Carmelo Pomodoro , the designer for Betty Hanson , paired bulky but lightweight sweaters with jacquard silk satin skirts and pants for an amalgam of casual and dressy forms . Sometimes the sweater repeats the gently colored flower pattern of the satin . Tropical worsted separates in pale shades and cotton lace full skirts are other innovative fashions here. // Two designers introduced new sportswear collections . The more modest presentation was Leo Narducci ' s . The design director of Dalton , the knitwear house , for the last three years , Mr. Naducci showed a well-rounded sportswear line under his own name . Prices are in the $60 to $200 range , styling is soft rather than hard-edged and Mr. Narducci has made good use of the parent company ' s knitwear facilities . Sweaters in stripes and other patterns are interesting without being ostentatious . A loose , short plum-colored pullover with checked culottes is a striking outfit , and a blue playsuit with a wide plaid overskirt seems timely . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his dramatic evening clothes , made his sportswear debut with a showing at the Hotel Pierre priced from $140 to $400 . The collection emphasizes what used to be called dressmaker details . A blouse with a lace-edged collar , a red stripe down the sleeves of a small navy jacket , sheer inserts and embroidery near the hem of a full skirt - these offer a change from sportswear ' s usual Spartan look . Navy crepe separates with a spaced white stripe were especially well received. // In his Greenwich Village headquarters at 214 Sullivan Street , where he is now selling to retail customers , Zoran is offering his bulky knit pullovers in cotton as well as cashmere to wear with satin pants . His cotton jersey separates are relatively inexpensive - a scoop-neck top sells for $60 . A black or white satin dress expresses his minimalist point of view . Curved back panels wrap around to tie at the front and one size fits everybody. // //                   @ @
