Long before its apartments were painted socialist red , even before its mayor sprayed his hair electric blue , West Hollywood was a colorful little rooster of a town . Defying expansion-minded Los Angeles , it remained an unincorporated no-man's-land , surrounded by the city but not a part of it , legally or spiritually . <P> From the days of Prohibition , West Hollywood 's famous Sunset Strip lay beyond the grasp of the Los Angeles police department , and it sheltered illicit casinos and speakeasy bars , patronized by gangsters and movie stars . During the ' 60s West Hollywood attracted hippies , druggies and rock-music clubs such as the Troubador and Whisky a GoGo . A decade later West Hollywood welcomed a migration of Russian Jews fleeing Soviet oppression and an influx of homosexuals weary of perceived harassment by the LAPD . <P> Today , in the public imagination , it is the homosexuals who define West Hollywood , which last month celebrated its first anniversary as America 's one and only " Gay City .

The mingling of these groups is best savored on a warm Friday evening along West Hollywood 's main artery , Santa Monica Boulevard . There , a black-clad Lubavitcher family straight out of 19th century Lithuania strolls past a bus bench shared by a sneering heavy-metal-music freak with a slime green Mohawk and a drag queen done up as Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz . Across the way , a convenience store advertises European specialties in Russian Cyrillic characters . And up the boulevard rolls a procession of white stretch limos , trundling the show-biz glitterati ( and their accountants and orthodontists ) to West Hollywood 's tonier night spots . <P> Families with children , the mainstay of most communities , are a distinct minority in West Hollywood , constituting only 5% of the populace . The local International House of Pancakes does far more business during Halloween and the Gay Pride Parade in June than on Mother 's Day .
