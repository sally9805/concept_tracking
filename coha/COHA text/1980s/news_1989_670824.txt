Scientists emphasized that the explanation was only a theory but a " reasonable " interpretation based on Triton ' s temperatures , pressures and chemical composition and the signs of probable volcanic vents and icy debris in pictures of the moon . The eruptions , they said , appeared to have occurred in recent times. // If the findings are confirmed , Triton would be only the third object in the solar system , after Earth and Jupiter ' s moon Io , known to have active volcanoes . The apparent volcanism on Triton , which is thought to result from heating under its icy surface , seems to be different from that on Earth and Io because of the different temperatures and the physical and chemical properties of the bodies. // // A Different Volcanism // Earlier , scientists had described other surface features of Triton that they said indicated a different type of nonexplosive volcanism had once shaped much of its frozen landscape. // The Voyager 2 spacecraft continued to operate flawlessly as it sped more than 2. 5 million miles beyond Neptune , which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the solar system . Its television cameras were still taking pictures of the planet and its broad band of surrounding rings. // Other new findings reported by scientists today included the existence of a blizzard of minuscule dust particles orbiting Neptune far beyond its visible rings . The dust particles pelted the spacecraft but caused no damage . Instruments picked up the sounds of impacts from the dust particles while crossing the plane where the ring are . <> <> Changed Finding on Axis // After further observations and analysis , scientists revised their conclusions about Neptune ' s magnetic fields . The axis of the planet ' s magnetic fields was found to be at an angle of 50 degrees from the axis along which it rotates , instead of the 30 degrees reported a day ago . This made Neptune appear to be almost a magnetic twin of Uranus , where the offset between the magnetic and rotational poles is 60 degrees. // Dr. Edward C. Stone of the California Institute of Technology , the chief project scientist , said Triton " keeps getting more and more interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a specialist on the moons of the outer planets , Dr. Laurence Soderblom of the United States Geological Survey , pointed out dark spots and streaks amid the bright icy features in Triton ' s south polar region and said these suggested the presence of active nitrogen volcanoes . The phenomenon may be occurring elsewhere on Triton , but has been found so far only in the southern region. // " They look to me like they are active , " Dr. Soderblom said of the explosive volcanoes . " They look like they ' ve been erupting in the last 100 years. " // Dr. Soderblom said the temperatures and pressures on Triton could transform nitrogen , a major component of both the moon ' s surface and its atmosphere , into a liquid state between 60 and 100 feet beneath the moon ' s surface . Under certain conditions , the liquid nitrogen could explode through vents in the surface to heights of 20 miles . Winds of 200 miles an hour could then carry the shower of nitrogen ice in plumes extending up to 30 miles wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deposits from such eruptions showed up clearly as dark streaks in the most recent photographs to be made public . <> <> A Cantaloupe Texture // One picture that especially fascinated scientists showed what they called the cantaloupe texture of dark and bright features on the surface throughout a broad region near the south pole of Triton . The picture showed more than 50 dark " wind streaks " on the icy surface that geologists said were probably the deposits of material carried by nitrogen gases and ice erupting out of the dark spots in the area. // Geologists said that methane in the throat of the vents was converted in chemical reactions to something like hydrocarbon tars . These materials derived from methane probably account for the dark coloring of the deposits. // Seeking an explanation for the dynamics of the wind streaks and dark spots , Voyager scientists recalled a prediction in 1984 by Dr. David Stevenson , a planetary astronomer at the California Institute of Technology . He proposed that some of the moons of the outer planets , like Triton , could have liquid methane beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Triton ' s surface is composed primarily of water , methane and nitrogen ices . Voyager 2 has determined that nitrogen is the " dominant " constituent of the moon ' s atmosphere , with methane also present . Before Voyager 2 , there had been some question among scientists about the presence of nitrogen there . <> <> Earlier Arguments Apply // Dr. Stone said the same arguments advanced in the hypothesis for methane volcanism could also be applied in support of the theory for nitrogen volcanoes on Triton. // On the surface of Triton , temperatures are a frigid 370 degrees below zero Fahrenheit . But subsurface temperatures are estimated to rise to 365 degrees above zero , which is about 20 degrees above the melting point for nitrogen . These conditions were cited to support the possibility of liquid nitrogen at subsurface levels. // Dr. Soderblom urged caution in speculating about volcanism and said the idea could turn out to be a " crazy theory , " but other scientists analyzing the pictures expressed their support for it . They noted that the eruptions could be triggered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately explosive pressures on the subsurface deposit of liquid nitrogen . It is now summertime in the southern region of Triton , as the moon accompanies its parent planet on a 165-year circuit of the sun. // The first look at close-up pictures of Triton led scientists to conclude that another kind of volcanic activity had created the broad frozen basins seen at many places . They said that the melting and refreezing of water over time had created cracks in Triton ' s frozen surface out of which mushy ice oozed from the interior . Long double ridge lines are thought to be places where the " slow-flow " icy volcanism had occurred in past . There was no evidence of any present extrusions. // Geologists analyzing the most recent pictures of Triton said the surface layers of pinkish material appeared to be quite thin . The pink coloring is believed to be caused by solar radiation damage to the methane ice , and since such discoloration would happen only near the surface of the ice , geologists believe it is thin . The white surface appeared to be frosts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression is of Triton being primarily a white object with a pinkish cast. //
