The leaders of the powerful Medellin cocaine cartel have become folk heroes for their ability to escape the relentless pursuit of government security forces . Last week Pablo Escobar Gaviria , 39 , a leader of the drug ring that controls 80% of the cocaine entering the U.S. , pulled off one of the most impressive getaways . In an operation code named Against the Fortress , some 600 police and army troops raided a ranch 70 miles outside Medellin , but Escobar managed to elude them . <P> When the police fleet of ten helicopters suddenly appeared overhead at 6:30 a.m. , one sentry ran to alert Escobar and others , while bodyguards opened fire with semiautomatic rifles . Escobar slipped away by running through a patch of wild cane , scuttling across a creek with planks laid over it and , finally , jumping into a speedboat and disappearing . A wide-scale ground and helicopter search failed to turn up Escobar , who is included on the U.S. Justice Department 's list of the twelve most wanted Colombian drug traffickers .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
