Digital Equipment Corp. ' s formal introduction of a bevy of powerful , low-priced , workstations yesterday is likely to shake up the hottest segment of the computer industry . Digital , the No. 2 computer maker after International Business Machines Corp. , is making low pricing a key weapon in its effort to capture the lead in the $4. 8 billion market for workstations  --  powerful personal computers for engineers . The low prices mark a new strategy for Digital , which , like IBM , has previously tried to convince buyers that they should pay more for the company ' s computers because of the service and security it offers . The Digital introduction could slow fast-growing Sun Microsystems Inc. of Mountain View , Calif. , and Hewlett-Packard Co. of Palo Alto , Calif . And analysts say that the new products will pose added problems for workstation pioneer Apollo Computer Inc. of Chelmsford , Mass. , which has posted losses in recent quarters . " For the first time , we have a dominant vendor in the industry riding the most aggressive price-performance curve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a U.S. unit of United Bank of Switzerland . " If you want a recipe for market consolidation , this is it . " The product that will shake up the market the most is an engineering workstation that uses a " reduced instruction set computing "  --  or RISC  --  microprocessor made by MIPS Computer Systems Inc . , Sunnyvale , Calif . Digital says the DECstation 3100 can handle 14 million instructions per second . Pricing starts at $11 , 900 for a diskless version with a small screen , making it one of the most powerful workstations for the money . " Our goal is to win the desktop , " says Domenic LaCava , Digital vice president , low-end systems . Digital , of Maynard , Mass. , made it clear that its new products are aiming to cut into sales by Sun , the workstation industry leader . Digital yesterday provided consultants and analysts with reams of benchmark tests comparing its new computers to Sun ' s . Mr. LaCava says that compared with the Sun 4 workstation with a RISC processor , the DECstation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much . " Like Sun ' s products , the DECstation 3100 only runs the Unix operating system , and some Digital workers have dubbed the machine " the Sun-killer . " Scott McNealy , Sun president , says Digital risks confusing its existing customers by suddenly adding industry-standard " RISC Unix boxes "  --  which only run standard industry software  --  to its family of internally designed systems . Earlier Digital products mainly are designed to run Digital ' s proprietary operating system . " Now the competitors are going to play in our sandbox , " Mr. McNealy says . " We ' ll all play by the RISC-Unix rules . " He adds that Sun sales and orders remain " above plan , " and that it is likely to be six months before much software written for other computer makers is converted to run on Digital ' s new system . Sun ' s most powerful machine , the Sun 4/260 RISC-Unix computer , with a speed of 10 million instructions per second , was introduced in 1987 and carries a $39 , 900 base price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $5 , 495 , about comparable to Digital ' s lowest priced system . Mark Stahlman , an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &; Co. , says he expects Sun to soon introduce a new generation of workstations , however , that will close the gap with Digital ' s latest products in price and performance . Digital is " comparing to two-year-old Sun products , " he says . Douglas Johnson , workstation product marketing manager for Hewlett-Packard , concedes that Digital ' s pricing on the DECstation 3100 is lower than any competitors . But , he says , " by the time Digital has a sizable software applications base , we ' ll be at the identical price performance . " Mr. Johnson says he thinks Digital is basing its prices on lower-cost computer chips that are expected to be available later this year  --  a pricing strategy Hewlett can ' t use because it would lose money on the large volume of sales it now has . Digital had been doing well in the workstation market before the latest product announcement . Last year , its VAXstation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Digital ' s VAX computers , was the best-selling workstation industry-wide based on volume , Mr. LaCava says . Digital strengthened its hand yesterday also by introducing the VAXstation 3100 , a workstation to run its proprietary operating system . With an estimated speed of about 2. 6 million instructions per second , it is more than twice as fast as the VAXstation 2000 . A diskless VAXstation 3100 carries a base price of $7 , 900 . Both the DECstation 3100 and the VAXstation 3100 are available now but won ' t be shipped in volume until April . Analysts say the new products are expected to boost revenue and earnings in Digital ' s fourth quarter ending June 30 . Digital also says it soon will introduce mid-range workstations that achieve better performance by linking two or four microprocessors together inside the system . It declines to disclose pricing . Charles Casale , an analyst with market researcher Aberdeen Group in Boston , says Digital fears that if it can ' t beat Sun now , " it will have forever lost the opportunity . " But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ margins , " triggering a workstation dogfight . " In the personal-computer arena , Digital carefully avoided getting into a price war by pricing its new DECstation personal computers , made by Tandy Corp. , well above the cheapest IBM compatibles . The personal computers , which are compatible with IBM ' s PC-AT computers , have a base price of $2 , 630 for a system based on the Intel Corp. 80286 and $3 , 485 for a system based on Intel ' s 80386 .
