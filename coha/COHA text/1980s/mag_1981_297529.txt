The French poet Andre Breton , leader of the surrealist movement , once defined surrealism as the juxtaposition of the familiar with the fantastic . As TIME correspondents moved through the strange netherworld of the arms trade for this week 's cover story , they reflected on their own surrealist experiences - sometimes comical , other times ominous - of encountering weapons both familiar and fantastic , in places both ordinary and exotic . TIME Correspondent Lee Griggs recalled watching a multiple rocket launcher known as a " Stalin organ " being unloaded from a Soviet ship at Luanda harbor in 1975 during the civil war in Angola . To his surprise , the Angolans did not seem alarmed by the arrival of such heavy firepower . " Organs go in churches , " said one . " Churches belong to God . He will not let that organ make war . " <P> The strangest " arms bazaar " that TIME Correspondent Bruce van Voorst had ever seen was a collection of grimy peasant tents spread out on a dusty knoll outside the town of Mahabad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clientele of mercenaries and international agents milled about , examining Israeli-made UZI automatics , Chinese and Soviet AK-47s , boxes of grenades , pre-World War II Czech-made Brno rifles and spanking new U.S. Colt .45 automatics . " For the serious customer , " says Van Voorst , " a salesman would casually discharge a few rounds into a nearby hillside . " <P> TIME 'S Bangkok correspondent David DeVoss found an equally thriving market in Dara Adam Khail , a mud-splattered tribal settlement in Pakistan 's North-West Frontier . Visiting in the early days of January 1980 , after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , DeVoss asked the most venerable gunsmith in Dara for a " beginner 's weapon . " From beneath a pile of Sten guns , the man unearthed what DeVoss thought was a ballpoint pen . But the pen could accommodate a .25-cal. slug that would kill at close range . <P> The cover story was researched by Betty Satterwhite Sutter , who uses non-lethal ballpoint pens , but has worked on so many armament stories during the past five years that she admits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rocket launchers . " Associate Editor Walter Isaacson , who wrote the cover , concluded after assessing the thousands of words filed by TIME correspondents : " The arms trade has created a global powder keg.
