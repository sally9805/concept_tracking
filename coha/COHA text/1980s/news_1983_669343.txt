On the face of it , a government run or influenced by the military would break with Filipino tradition . Like its former colonizer , the United States , the Philippines has tended to have a strictly professional and apolitical military establishment. // But , in fact , the tradition has already been broken . Ten years of martial law in the Philippines ( September 1972 to January 1981 ) transformed the military into a major force in social and political life. // Under martial law , military officers ran law courts , local governments , federal agencies , and quite a few companies formerly owned by members of the opposition . Some commanders of the Armed Forces of the Philippines ( AFP ) joined the inner circle of Marcos confidants and advisers. // They are still there today . Several generals remain probably the President ' s most trusted aides , while the military continues to be active in areas far removed from the usual purview of soldiers. // It was , for example , a committee of officers which invited some of the country ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , to three- or four-hour dialogues late last year . The journalists say the dialogues in fact bordered on intimidation. // Several factors may make the military a political force to contend with : // // * Its size , which almost tripled during martial law . In 1972 the combined forces of the AFP and the paramilitary Philippine Constabulary ( PC ) stood at 54 , 000 . Today they number 156 , 000 . Ten years ago they were backed up by a paramilitary force - village-based home defense volunteers - of just 400 men . Today there are more than 60 , 000 home defense force volunteers throughout the country. // // * Its scope . In the Philippines today there are probably only two institutions that spread down to the grass roots throughout the country : the Roman Catholic Church and the military . And in many places the two are at loggerheads . Civilian local government and grass-roots civilian politics have been slow to recover from the enforced inactivity of martial law. // // * And its cohesion . There are of course rivalries inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between graduates of the Philippine Military Academy ( PMA ) , the country ' s West Point , and the reserve officers , whom PMA graduates tend to look down on . Some officers are said to be frustrated by the preference they claim has been given to officers from the President ' s home province of Ilocos Norte. // But if there are any major political rifts inside the armed forces , they have been well hidden from outside eyes . And their cohesion is all the more striking when compared with Mr. Marcos ' civilian supporters in his Movement for a New Society ( known as Kilusang Bagong Lipunan or KBL in the national language , Tagalog ) . They are currently embroiled in a fight over the future of the prime minister , Cesar Virata. // Top military leaders seem totally devoted to the President , but they may not automatically transfer that devotion to a successor - even one handpicked by Marcos. // Two of the most influential military officers are relatives of the President : Gen. Fabian Ver , chief of staff , head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board , is said to be an uncle of the President ; the deputy chief of staff and commander of the Philippine Constabulary , Gen. Fidel Ramos , is reportedly a cousin. // Both were part of the small group of men who planned martial law , and both have accrued political power and experience since then . There are , however , signs that General Ver does not see eye to eye with another architect of martial law - and would-be successor to the President - Juan Ponce Enrile. // A source sympathetic to Mr. Enrile says there have been ' ' several attempts to drive a wedge between the President and Enrile . ' ' The wedge driver , the source suggested , was General Ver . And , the source continued , although General Ver is only chief of staff , he sometimes bypasses Mr. Enrile on important appointments. // In a recent case , informed sources say , the general went over the defense minister ' s head to persuade President Marcos to recall retired Gen. Pacifico de Leon to active service to assume an important army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AFP is usually thought to be oversupplied with active-duty generals. // Shortly after the appointment was announced , the country ' s biggest daily newspaper , the Bulletin Today , reported ' ' widespread demoralization ' ' among senior officers following the recall of General de Leon . The author of the report is considered close to Mr. Enrile . General de Leon ' s appointment quickly became embroiled in further controversy : His son-in-law was arrested and accused of having tried to use the general ' s name to avoid arrest . And a major government development program the general headed became the target of allegations of corruption and gangland killings . The President faded out of the picture. // Generals Ver and Ramos are reported to get on better with Mrs. Marcos . The First Lady , as she likes to be called , has her own allies in the military , though . Her brother-in-law , General Yap , heads the Army Reserve Command , and she is reported to be seeking her own bright young military men. // ' ' Most of the officer corps may well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' ' an observer said , ' ' but the next time around they will not just be servants and they may want to be kingmakers. // Events in the countryside may also affect future military thinking . Faced with an increase in the activities of the communist New People ' s Army , the government has recently reorganized the armed forces and committed elite units to the affected areas . In addition , just before the new US-Philippines agreement on military bases was signed earlier this month , Prime Minister Virata reportedly said that a large amount of the new base rental payments would be used to buy up-to-date counterinsurgency equipment . The five-year base agreement provides Manila with a total of $900 million , $400 million earmarked for military purchases. // Officers in anticommunist activities in the field describe themselves as working in tandem with the civilian part of the government . ' ' Basically we ' re trying to hold down insurgency to tolerable levels until civilian development programs can bite , ' ' said Col. Dionisio Tan-Gatue , PC commander in one of the hottest regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduate , is described by his associates as a protege of Mrs. Marcos. // But what if the civilian side fails to do its bit ? Some more junior officers involved in civic action programs - originated by the CIA ' s Maj. Gen. Edward G. Lansdale in the Philippines during an earlier communist revolt - seem already to be having doubts. // ' ' We have a big job , ' ' said an officer in an insurgent area . ' ' We have to make up for years of neglect here . ' ' Another officer in the same area remarked that ' ' when we do real civic action - listening to local grievances , for example - we sometimes get the feeling that local officials don ' t want us around , ' ' - a broad hint that the officials were the problem rather than the solution. // Some senior officers are , like the President ' s civilian supporters , sometimes accused of profiting from their new prominence . A Manila magazine claimed recently that an unnamed ' ' top AFP general ' ' was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently bought expensive real estate in the United States. // In 1979 a group of dissident Manila businessmen claimed that the then chief of staff , Gen. Romeo Espino , had assumed control of 15 commercial companies taken over upon the declaration of martial law . Other unnamed senior officers were recently accused of thwarting an anti-vice drive in Quezon City , Manila ' s twin city , by acting as ' ' godfathers ' ' for the establishments targeted in the campaign. // As for the future , most military officers for the time being are probably undecided . But though they may not often confide their political views to civilians , there seems little doubt that they are watching the political scene carefully . At the end of a long talk , during which a well-educated young officer had given fairly standard issue answers to questions about the military operations , this reporter asked him if the army would ever take power. // ' ' I don ' t think that ' s in the cards , ' ' the officer replied . ' ' Not at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
