Living skin-like tissue may soon be available for use in human patients to replace burned skin and clogged blood vessels . These tissues , developed by Prof. Eugene Bell and his colleagues at MIT , are made from a patient ' s own cells , and thus would not be rejected by the body . This new laboratory-grown tissue is so promising for use as replacement skin , Bell said , that samples will soon be tested on patients at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston . The tissue , which can be grown in sheets , tubes or other shapes , can be used to replace blood vessels , surface skin or organ tissue . A complete scientific report on the technique has been submitted to a scientific journal for publication , Bell said . Used as a protective covering , the tissues help minimize scarring resulting from burns . Until now there have been no good substitutes for normal human skin , although healthy skin can sometimes be transplanted from one area of the body to another to cover a burned area . Pigskin and thin plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of fluids , but they can only be used temporarily because they won ' t adhere permanently . This new MIT development , then , may provide the first living substance that can become a permanent replacement for skin . In experiments - mostly with rats - the artificial skin has survived beyond five months . Research has also shown that the artificial skin has been " vascularized , " meaning blood vessels have grown into the bottom layer , the dermis , which keeps it healthy , but it carries none of the specialized cells that can produce hair or sweat glands . Bell ' s new skin-building technique has already been patented by MIT , and has been licensed for commercial use by Flow Laboratories Inc. , a relatively young biomedical products firm with headquarters in McLean , Va . Flow Laboratories is also exclusive licensee for an MIT- developed process for producing a potential anticancer , antiviral drug , interferon . In discussing the techniques used in making artificial skin , Bell explained : " We ' ve come across a very interesting phenomenon . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of collagen and a number of other ingredients , we observe that a Jello-like matrix forms , and in time the cells convert this matrix into a tissue . " This sheet of cellular material , or tissue , is then called dermis . " A second type of cells , epidermal cells taken from the outer part of a patient ' s skin , are added to the sheet of dermis tissue , which then arranges itself into " several levels of cells , just the way it is in the skin . " The connective tissue cells apparently pulls the collagen fibers together , squeezing out the water , forming the strong tissue . Collagen is an insoluble , fibrous protein , which is abundant in skin , tendons and other structures of the body . The result of this process , Bell said , is that " it makes something tough ; we can handle it , we can sew it . " When we stick this tissue on the animal , in three or four days it ' s vascularized , infiltrated by blood vessels . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on humans , at Beth Israel Hospital . We ' ll be working jointly with Prof. Robert Goldwin . " The initial experiments , Bell said , were done in collaboration with Dr. Paul Ehrlich , at the Shriners Burn Institute in Boston . " The nice part , " Bell said , " is that we can make as much skin as we want to . I don ' t think we ' d be ready to treat ( patients from ) a major disaster in a matter of days , but we would be ready within a couple of weeks . " " We could grow enough skin to treat my whole body , " Bell added , " but it would take a month " to grow that much new skin . In the meantime , he explained , it might be possible to cover major burns with temporary skin-like materials to keep the wound from contracting as it tries to heal . That may seeem like a long time , but now , when patients have skin grafts done , he said , they must often return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such wounds . Such a process can take months or even years . In addition to growing sheets of skin , Bell said , it is possible to grow this tissue on different-shaped surfaces , such as a cylinder . When this is done , the result is a tubular piece of tissue that can be turned into a blood vessel . For a blood vessel , for instance , the tube would be sprinkled with living endothelial cells , the type of cells that normally line the inside of blood vessels . Once the endothelial cells have taken up residence in the tissue , blood flowing through the vessel should feel right at home . " We can make a cylinder of any size , or we can cast this material into any shape ; I could make myself a glove , or a face . And skin is just the beginning . " Once the new skin-growing technique is fully understood , a whole variety of new applications may become possible , Bell said . Specialists in many different medical fields can be expected to adapt this system to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , to " seed " connective tissue with other important types of cells , such as insulin-producing beta cells from the pancreas , with liver cells , or with other hormone- producing cells . If such cells can be induced to divide , increasing their numbers , then they might be attached to this new connective tissue and could be grafted back into the host . If this works , it might provide a means for delivering additional hormone-producing cells into a person who has too few . This system could also be useful in proposed genetic engineering work . Once scientists learn to manipulate the genes - which are the basic chemical messages of heredity found in every living cell - they could potentially remove faulty cells , make specific genetic corrections , then use Bell ' s system as a means of putting the cells back into the patients . Thus it may eventually become possible to correct inborn genetic diseases such as hemophilia , Tay-Sachs disease or PKU ( phenylketonuria ) , Bell said .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
