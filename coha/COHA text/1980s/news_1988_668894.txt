With a subdued crowd listlessly waving Maple Leaf flags , heavily favored Canada wavered on its home ice Sunday with an unimpressive 1-0 victory over Poland . Marc Habscheid scored 4 : 22 into the game , but the fourth-seeded Canadians couldn ' t capitalize on any other opportunities as goalie Gabriel Samolej played brilliantly for eighth-seeded Poland . " Our players approached the game with emotion , " said Poland coach Leszek Lejczyk . " They were psyched . " Andy Moog , one of 12 former National Hockey League players on Canada ' s team , got the shutout but was rarely tested in making 17 saves . When he was tested , he almost failed . At 5 : 22 of the third period , Poland nearly tied the score . Krystian Sikorski fired a 55-footer from straight in front of Moog , who got his hand up late and the puck ticked off his glove . The puck hit the crossbar , then bounced in front of the net . In their five previous meetings in Olympic competition , Canada had outscored Poland 48-2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s advantage was 261-9 . " We feel we played very well , " said Guy Charron , Canada ' s assistant coach . " That ' s what counts . If the people are concerned , we ' re not . " The Canadians had to hustle for their goal . Trent Yawney passed the puck alongside the left boards . Samolej , who made many difficult saves in facing 29 shots , stopped it with his stick behind the net and left it for a teammate . Canada ' s Gord Sherven got there first , passed the puck in front of the net and Habscheid connected from 15 feet . Habscheid , Steve Tambellini and Merlin Malinowski all took shots for Canada that hit posts in the second period . At 1 : 07 of the third period , Serge Bosivert had a clean shot at Samolej from 10 feet but put the puck right into the goalie ' s chest . Moog had to do some late shopping . He needed a mask . He said the International Ice Hockey Federation ruled that his regular mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at a sports store , " Moog said . He said water dripped into the new mask and his vision blurred when he looked toward the lights . Moog said the IIHF doesn ' t allow masks with a crossbar that could permit a stick or puck to hit the goalie ' s face . " You have to have a screen and a helmet , and our mask wasn ' t considered a helmet by the IIHF .

In the opening period , Sweden , the top seed in the A pool , couldn ' t break away from France , the 12th-seeded team in the tournament . When former NHL forward Paulin Bordeleau tied the scored with 7 : 10 left in the first period , offsetting a goal by Ulf Sandstrom , it looked as if French coach Kjell Larsson ' s forecast of his team ' s fate might have been too severe . Asked before the Olympics if his team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an assistant coach for Sweden in the 1984 Games , bluntly answered , " No . " A French player , Philippe Bozon , had said , " We know we ' re going to lose for sure against Sweden . " Sure enough , Larsson and Bozon were right , even though Sweden started third-string goalie Peter Ashlin . Forty-five seconds into the second period , Sodergren snapped a wrist shot over the shoulder of goalie Patrick Foliot. and Sweden never looked back .
