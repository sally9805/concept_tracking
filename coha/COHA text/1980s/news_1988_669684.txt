Max Friedersdorf - a silver-haired , no-nonsense Indianan - billed the move as ' ' unprecedented. ' ' // ' ' Today , the United States delegation is taking another major step toward greater openness , ' ' he told the Conference on Disarmament here in July. // ' ' We are declaring the location of each of our chemical weapons production facilities , ' ' he said , handing a map to the diplomats assembled in the United Nations ' high-ceilinged conference room. // The gesture made news headlines. // // Something , however , was overlooked in the hubbub : As American officials later admitted , each of the five sites had already been disclosed publicly - in some cases years earlier . Furthermore , not all of the facilities produce chemical weapons - one , in fact , has been mothballed for 31 years . ( See article , Page B3. ) // Soviet Ambassador Yuri Nazarkin was less than thunderstruck by the American revelations. // ' ' This , ' ' he said , with a hint of a smile , ' ' was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject. ' ' // It was also meant to do something more - to goad the Soviets into revealing the locations of their chemical weapons facilities , which , unlike those of the US , are a closely guarded secret. // The Soviets themselves have not been above headline-grabbing when it suited their purposes. // THE year before , the Soviet Union had invited diplomats and journalists from around the world to visit the main chemical weapons proving ground at Shikhany , in the central Soviet Union . It was billed as a thorough disclosure of the Soviet chemical arsenal. // What the waiting audience got was something else. // ' ' It was quite clear that the weapons they demonstrated were of World War II and 1950s vintage , ' ' a West European military official says . ' ' The visit sort of begged more questions than it answered. ' ' // The Soviets also claimed at the time that they possessed only 50 , 000 tons of chemical weapons - a figure far below Western intelligence estimates. // Still , staging the Shikhany visit allowed the Soviets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the size of its chemical weapons stockpile. // ' Guerrilla ' tactics at talks // SO it has gone for 20 years . Legions of diplomats have used a combination of patient plodding , patent puffery , and pure propaganda to nudge one another other toward a comprehensive , verifiable , worldwide ban on the production , stockpiling , and use of chemical weapons. // The chief forum has been the Conference on Disarmament here in Geneva . One participant says , only half jokingly , that what passes for diplomacy here more closely resembles ' ' discreet guerrilla warfare. ' ' // On the face of it , the Geneva talks would seem to be a classic case of fiddling while the city burns . During the two decades of negotiations , the number of nations confirmed or suspected of having a chemical warfare capability has risen , according to the US government , from five to 22. // And over the past five years , the world has witnessed the first sustained use of chemical weapons since World War I - in the Gulf war between Iran and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Still , although there are major hurdles ahead , the world is probably closer to a ban on chemical weapons than anyone would have thought possible even a few years ago . In fact , the outlines of a formal treaty or convention banning chemical weapons are clear . And what ' s taking shape here in Geneva is perhaps the most detailed , far-reaching arms control document in history. // ' ' At the simplest level , a lot of people are very frightened at being attacked with chemical weapons , ' ' says Nicholas Sims , a lecturer in international relations at the London School of Economics . ' ' The simplest way to get rid of that fear is to get rid of the enemy ' s weapons . And you ' re not going to get that without getting rid of your own . Hence , multilateral disarmament. ' ' // ' ' It seems to me , ' ' Mr. Sims adds , ' ' we ' re a lot closer to disarmament in this area than in any other. ' ' // Matthew Meselson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the chemical weapons talks , echoes that optimism . He predicts that there will be an agreement in a year or two. // One reason for hope , Dr. Meselson says , is that US President-elect George Bush has repeatedly and forcefully declared his support for such a treaty - and says he wants to be the President who signs it. // In fact , it was Mr. Bush who introduced a comprehensive proposal for a treaty at Geneva in 1984 . The document has since become the principal working text for negotiators. // But it probably would have languished had not Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze , in 1987 , announced that the Soviet Union supported even more extensive verification provisions than those in the Bush proposals. // What US plan would do // THE treaty document , though it has received little publicity , would have a major impact on the chemistry , biotechnology , and pharmaceutical industries worldwide . It would give international inspectors virtually unfettered access to many nations ' most sensitive high-security areas. // It would create a new international agency , and obligate nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in business . And it would also require the destruction of thousands of tons of deadly chemical warfare agents , raising untold environmental and safety considerations. // In just 146 pages , it would do all that - and more. // Why the CIA wouldn ' t like it // TO be sure , some of the text bears only passing resemblance to political realities . One US proposal , for example , allows any country signing the treaty to initiate a ' ' challenge ' ' inspection of a suspect site ' ' anywhere ' ' in other countries that have signed the convention - with no possibility of refusal. // That proposal , as written , would theoretically allow the Soviet Union to demand that inspectors be allowed into the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) in Langley , Va . For that matter , the US could demand an inspection of the headquarters of the Soviet Committee on State Security ( KGB ) in Moscow. // The Soviets , in a game of diplomatic one-upmanship , agreed to the US proposal - knowing full well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' There are facilities that the CIA doesn ' t even want to acknowledge exist at all , ' ' let alone open to inspections , one US government official says . ' ' It ' s safe to assume that the final inspection clause will be something less than what ' s on the table now , ' ' says another US official familiar with the American side ' s negotiating strategy. // But that ' s the nub of the problem : If the treaty can ' t be verified , it won ' t be effective. // ' ' We can ' t take a treaty that ' s not verifiable , ' ' Friedersdorf says , ' ' because it won ' t be ratified by the ( US ) Senate. ' ' // Chemical , weapon , or both ? // VERIFYING the destruction and nonproduction of chemical weapons agents is particularly difficult , because they can be manufactured as easily in an ordinary chemical complex as in a military installation . In fact , many of the chemicals that go into warfare agents are widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in Geneva have crafted a unique solution to the problem - one that is far more detailed than any previous arms control effort. // The treaty not only demands destruction of military stocks of warfare agents , but provides for inspections at certain civilian facilities as well. // It includes lists , called ' ' schedules , ' ' of chemicals that would be monitored during the production process . The schedules are open-ended ; that is , new toxic chemicals can be added to them , if and when they are developed. // There is disagreement over the details of carrying out the treaty . The degree of consensus that has been reached so far is , however , remarkable , especially since there are 40 countries taking part in the talks. // ' ' A multilateral treaty of such enormous complexity has never been taken up like this , ' ' a West European ambassador says. // ' ' This is certainly new , ' ' he adds. // Who ' s talking to whom // IN no other arms control negotiations does , for example , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only a fledgling chemical indus-try , enjoy equal status with the superpowers. // According to negotiators and close observers , the countries taking part in the Geneva talks have played varying roles during the course of the talks. // One reason is that they are representing not only the interests of their respective governments , but their commercial chemical industries as well. // Their performances have drawn mixed reviews. // Sims , the London School of Economics lecturer , who has followed the talks over the years , is full of praise for some countries like Britain ( ' ' an honest broker ' ' ) , Canada ( ' ' a consistently excellent role right the way through ' ' ) , and the Netherlands ( ' ' excellent ' ' ) . // On the other hand , he says , ' ' France has been incredibly irresponsible ' ' by touting a proposal , since abandoned , that countries should first have the right to build up their chemical weapons stocks before destroying them . ' ' The other Western countries have been , I think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysts are more critical. // Countries like Brazil , Japan , and West Germany have been in favor of destroying existing chemical weapons stocks , but far less enthusiastic about tough inspections to ensure that no new chemical agents are being manufactured , says one well-placed diplomat. // ' ' The dividing line in the West is basically West Germany and Japan against everybody else , ' ' says Elisa Harris , a researcher at the Brookings Institution . Other countries ' ' are reconciled to the inspections. ' ' // The West Germans , she says , are concerned about the loss of proprietary information to snoopy inspectors , although Bonn is ' ' coming around. ' ' // The Japanese are concerned about that - but also about the suggestion that some outside agency needs to ensure that they aren ' t cheating . ' ' They feel it ' s an insult and humiliation to them , ' ' Ms. Harris says. // India and other developing countries have , according to a number of diplomats , attempted to extract economic aid for their chemical industries from developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Friedersdorf , while being careful not to name names , is highly critical of such moves . ' ' Of the 40 countries here , 90 percent of them are sincere . . . . ' ' He has an unadorned term for what the other 10 percent are doing : // ' ' I call it bribery. ' ' // Other countries , meanwhile , are making substantial contributions to the negotiations , even though they ' re not directly involved . ( See story , Page B9. ) // Who foots inspection bill ? // THERE are disagreements over the size and the authority of an international inspection agency to enforce the treaty. // But there is wide agreement that it will be a costly undertaking , reaching into the tens of millions of dollars. // Some developing countries question why they should be asked to foot even part of the bill - especially when they have no chemical weapons stockpiles themselves. // There is also the problem of ensuring that other countries , which have not taken part in the negotiations , will sign the resulting treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // But other Mideast countries that possess chemical weapons - such as Iraq , Israel , Libya , and Syria - are not. // In some countries , private chemical companies could throw up roadblocks to a treaty . West European chemical trade groups , in particular , have been opposed to inspection plans being drawn up. // The treaty is , however , receiving broad support from US chemical manufacturers , most of which want to avoid association with chemical warfare. // The difference is partly because US chemical companies enjoy a large domestic market . European manufacturers are more dependent on export markets and would be more affected by export controls. // ' ' We are foursquare for a treaty , ' ' says Kyle Olson , associate director for health , safety , and chemical regulations of the American Chemical Manufacturers Association. // ' ' There ' s no money in it that justifies this business , and we don ' t want this kind of business. ' ' // Experts from such companies as Monsanto and DuPont have advised US diplomats during the negotiations. // Keeping tabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Olson says , it ' s become clear that ' ' there are a large number of companies out there that have the capability of producing weapons material. ' ' // ' ' That , unfortunately , is the nature of toxic chemicals. ' ' // Some experts also conclude that a civilian plant could be switched to chemical weapons production , then ' ' scrubbed ' ' and switched back to normal production quickly - with little chance of detection. // ' ' You can convert a chemical facility in 24 hours , ' ' says one US intelligence analyst. // The CIA has been asked to determine how easily such clandestine production could be detected , an American official says. // The conclusion : The probability of successful detection is ' ' pretty low. ' ' // ' ' Most people I ' ve talked to are convinced that 100 percent verifiability is not possible , ' ' Friedersdorf says. // The challenge , a European diplomat says , is to ' ' provide . . . a security framework that . . . makes it attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not producing chemical weapons outweigh the advantages gained by producing them. ' ' // Ironically , the challenge is not just to convince other countries of the benefits of forswearing chemical warfare - but to convince diverse arms of the United States government , too. // The US view // THE US State Department and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency are notably more warm to the idea of a treaty than the Pentagon. // ' ' I think we can all dream , ' ' says Gen. Gerald Watson , the commander of the US Army Chemical School at Fort McClellan , Ala. , referring to the goal of eliminating chemical weapons from the battlefield . ' ' But the reality is , ' ' he says , ' ' we can ' t achieve that with any degree of verification. ' ' // Thomas Welch , an adviser to the US secretary of defense , says that while he favors eliminating chemical weapons , ' ' no nation has ever been attacked with chemical weapons if that nation had a credible chemical deterrent capability. ' ' // ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomat who is taking part in the Geneva negotiations , ' ' it seems as if the Americans are hesitating to accept their own proposals. ' ' // One West European diplomat involved in the talks complains that ' ' the great problem this year at the negotiations has been that the White House has not been capable of getting its act together. ' ' // ' ' It is felt , ' ' he says , ' ' that there is no consistent ( United States ) policy. ' ' // But US officials note that only in the last two years have the Soviets been energized. // Some of them say the negotiations at Geneva would still be deadlocked if the US had not , in 1984 , embarked on a multimillion-dollar effort to modernize its chemical weapons arsenal. // Friedersdorf says of the Soviets : ' ' Their interest started , almost to the exact hour , when Congress gave approval to the modernization program. ' ' // Soviet negotiator Nazarkin denies that the US program was the stimulus : ' ' The real stimulus is our real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A treaty should be signed ' ' as soon as possible - the sooner the better , ' ' he says. // Countering arguments of deterrent capability , Harvard ' s Meselson says it ' s unlikely that newer weapons systems will lead to chemical disarmament. // ' ' There is no technological fix , ' ' he says . ' ' The only fix is to set an example of acceptable behavior in the world so that people don ' t use chemical weapons. ' ' // And making a commitment to hammering out a treaty is a necessary step , he adds . ' ' Sooner or later , the human race has to get off the notion of doing everything like scorpions in a bottle. ' ' // The superpowers , Meselson says , should focus on their common interest in decreasing the threat of chemical and biological warfare worldwide. // ' ' Our interest , ' ' Meselson says , ' ' is a common interest in keeping these things from becoming the norm in future wars .

Along with others , such as Israel , the superpowers regard the protocol as binding only in a conflict with signatory nations. // Among the protocol ' s weaknesses are ambiguous language , lack of enforcement procedures , and lack of restrictions on production , stockpiling , or transfer of chemical weapons .
