Nothing too heavy in the intellectual diet this day , it being best to go slow and cool upon the brains fevered by the week ' s high , fiendish heat . Some swells at play in the fields of the Lord , some armchair sports for the easily- fatigued , a bite to eat and a shrine of capitalism : that ' s the ticket . - Town &; Country is usually good for a mean-tempered chuckle or two at the expense of our social betters , and the July issue is no exception . To begin , T &C; offers a guide for those contemplating a plunge into the cultivated world of international horse racing , in which the people appear to have been bred very nearly as carefully as the ponies and with much the same consequences for their facial structures . Indeed , were it not for the frocks on the pelts of the ladies , and the fur coats smoothly fitted to the mares , one might findhimself hard pressed to distinguish the owners from the chattels . Especially since , it is rumored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the readership this month will dote upon T &C'; sreconnaissance of Marbella , the Spanish resort where Bjorn Borg offers tutelage in tennis and occasionally goes so far as to make brief appearances . Closer to home is Landt Dennis ' rather colorlessly-dispatched vision of Martha ' s Vineyard , which requires the conclusion that Jackie Onassis and Carly Simon are the only island residents under the age of 85 . William Gildea examined the watering holes preferred by the better sort billeting at Rehoboth Beach , Delaware , though they do seem a rather stuffy lot - the people described and depicted in these T &C; dog-and-pony shows never seem to have any fun , but instead devote all of their time to dressing up and posing . - Inside Sports for July has some mildly-diverting fodder . Tom Boswell finds Ken Singleton of the Orioles a mannerly and personable fellow , personality characteristics by no means universal among ballplayers of his talent . Tom Shales strained himself to produce an article simultaneously informative and diverting on the topic of " rasslin . ' For all I know , hesucceeded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , the product isn ' t very interesting . Roy Blount Jr . reports on the nutty behavior of Twins outfielder Mickey Hatcher ; Blount ' s a splendid writer , and Hatcher appears to be a genuine free spirit , but this too is a genre piece . Theodore Beitchman has some views on Wimbledon conqueror John McEnroe , all of them abundantly reported elsewhere during the past fortnight . Tony Kornheiser did a Joe- Namath-Reaches-38 update which Modern Screen or Photoplay would be proud to include in the files of hard-hitting journalism . And last but not least , we have novelist Richard Ford on the personalities of major league ballparks ; to read him on Fenway is to perceive at once that Ford is a man who knows a sterling phrase when he sees it : " " Too small for a ballpark , ' they say , " too big for a bridge tournament . ' " Even Yr . Obt . Svt. is impressed with that , and claims every night to be , having published it about Fenway in " The Ultimate Baseball Book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Gourmet for July offers Robin McDowall ' s paean to the gardens at Sissinghurst planted by the late Harold Nicholson and his wife , V. Sackville- West , using that as a preamble to a feast at The Three Chimneys , an inn decorating the Kentish countryside nearby . See also Lillian Langseth- Christensen on stuffing yourself in the Italian Tyrol ; there must be something about good living which conduces to the writing of good prose . - Fortune for the 13th has John Carson-Parker ( this seems to be a week for bifurcated bylines ) on the crafty capitalists who run Morgan Guaranty Trust with understatement and acumen .

Arthur Louis says SEC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information seem like a good idea , but can not be enforced . Good solid issue . - GEO for July is a buffet for the generalist . Fred Hapgood , who used to labor in Boston vineyards , has taken up with bats , and his article is well done . Hermann Schreiber likes Tokyo but doesn ' t feature earthquakes ; his prose is enough to sedate a rhino on the rampage . Charles Mann went to the island of Malta and wrote a good piece about a feisty people who are heartily sick of all interlopers . Marc Reisner says New Yorkers may soon be drinking their whiskey neat : no water , or not enough . Good issue . - The New Yorker continues its four-week emphasis on Jervis Anderson ' s history of Harlem , which is very fine work but pretty much monopolizes the book . John McLoughlin confronted the snapping turtle for the July Country Journal , finding a truculent beast , while Benjamin Bachman says the rurals need the railroads even more than do the city dwellers . Do not attend an auction without heeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful thanks to Ronald Reagan , who by naming Judge Sandra D. O ' Connor to the Supreme Court pitted the Moral Majority against the Women ' s Libbers for a media struggle sure to lend the zest of mortal combat to the dullest season of the year for journalism .
