More than a year ago , when a Houston jury ordered Texaco to pay Pennzoil an incredible $10.5 billion to settle their legal battle over a 1984 merger fight , many experts were convinced that the landmark judgment would be drastically reduced on appeal . But so far Texaco 's lawyers have been unable to defuse this financial time bomb that threatens the survival of the third largest U.S. oil company . A Texas court of appeals last week upheld a staggering $8.5 billion of the original judgment . <P> + Texaco Chief Executive James Kinnear was incredulous . " It is appalling , " he said . " The decision supports an outrageous judgment totally at odds with both the law and the facts . " The company vowed to fight all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court .

Including accumulated interest , Texaco now owes Pennzoil a total of $10.2 billion . The judgment remains by far the largest ever awarded in a corporate court battle . <P> Joe Jamail , the Houston lawyer who has become a Texas folk hero by championing Pennzoil 's case , crowed about his latest triumph . Said Jamail : " I 'm a happy man today . The judgment says that the conduct of Texaco management was guilty and malicious . " Investors share his enthusiasm : Pennzoil stock rose 10 1/8 , closing the week at 81 1/8 , while Texaco shares fell 3 , to 35 1/2 . <P> If Pennzoil pockets anything close to an $8 billion judgment , analysts expect it to go on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennzoil 's chief executive , J.

Some oil executives may be anxious about the company 's future , but the depressed state of the industry ensures that almost no one turns down a chance to do business with Texaco . No creditors are demanding to be paid in cash . There can be no doubt , though , that its battle with Pennzoil has preoccupied Texaco executives and employees . All are well aware that if Texaco loses the final round of its battle with Pennzoil , the firm will have little choice but to file for bankruptcy protection . <P> A more likely denouement of this corporate drama is that Pennzoil and Texaco will finally strike an out-of-court deal . Texaco might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including , perhaps , the Getty Oil company . The two companies have tried and failed to make their peace several times so far .
