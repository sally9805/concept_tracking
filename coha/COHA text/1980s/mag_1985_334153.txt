The most common lament of stage actresses is a lack of good parts for older women . The Octette Bridge Club , a comedy about eight matronly Irish Catholic sisters who meet every other Friday during the 1930s and 1940s to play cards and swap stories , remedies that problem . The narrative is slight and achieves its climaxes by announcing rather than portraying them . But the current production displays some of Broadway 's most skilled actresses demonstrating how to employ the briefest dialogue to imply unspoken volumes . Playwright Barry keeps the inner lives of the sisters well guarded , by intention : he means to examine the kind of militantly conventional family in which candor is considered bad taste and emotional intimacy is a form of weakness . Whenever a painful truth slips out , these women change the subject or crack a joke . <P> The performers dig beneath this mannerism to suggest years of buried sorrow . Nancy Marchand , as the family 's self-described cutup , has the gift of making banal observations sound witty . Anne Pitoniak , as the eldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peggy Cass is the family entertainer , Elizabeth Franz its happiest housewife and Gisela Caldwell its edgy protofeminist , whose eventual crack-up seems to result from her discontent with women 's lot . The most affecting performance comes from Bette Henritze , as a stroke victim whose singsong speech does not obscure a larger tragedy . When she admits , " I 'm not very demonstrative , " she speaks for the whole family and sets in motion a tentative embrace of reconciliation that ends the play without really changing the lonely togetherness of the octette.
