New homeowners these days often feel that getting a mortgage is akin to getting mugged . Soaring interest rates and skyrocketing housing costs mean that fewer and fewer people can qualify for the traditional fixed-interest 30-year loan . As a result , bankers and mortgage brokers are busy devising new financing gimmicks that give more people a chance to buy homes . At the same time the conventional home loan may be on the way out . Says Ronald A. Wilbur , president of the New Hampshire Association of Savings Banks : " The fixed-rate , 30-year mortgage is more than likely a thing of the past . " Some of the innovative new financing schemes : <P> Graduated Payment Mortgages . These plans allow low monthly charges in the early years of the loan and then higher ones later , when the family breadwinner presumably will have a better income . The monthly payment on a $50,000 loan at 12% , for example , might be $396 , or $118 lower than normal at the time the mortgage starts , but by the sixth year it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become increasingly popular , but many families may find that their incomes do not rise as fast as their payments . Warns Atlanta Real Estate Broker Alma Fuller : " This kind of mortgage is fine for a doctor just going into practice , but in general it 's a very dangerous way to go . " <P> Variable or Renegotiable-Rate Mortgages , Payments under these plans are adjusted periodically to reflect the general level of interest rates in the economy . Under federal rules , the charge can go up or down by only half a percentage point per year up to a maximum of five points over the life of the loan . Many home buyers find such mortgages attractive because they do not want to be tied into a 13% or 14% loan for 30 years-in case interest rates some day fall back to 6% or so . But buyers having variable interest mortgages also run the risk that rising rates will push their loan payments still higher . <P> Owner Financing . Thousands of frustrated home buyers are now bypassing the bank and borrowing money directly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this type of financing is the only way they can sell their houses because so many potential buyers can not qualify for bank loans . The buyer , for example , might borrow half the needed money from the owner at 8% interest and the rest from a bank at 14% . <P> Shared Appreciation Mortgages . The New York brokerage house of Oppenheimer &; Co. has promoted this arrangement , whereby the borrower receives a mortgage rate that is one-third lower than the prevailing level , for example 9% rather than 14% . But the borrower must agree to give the lender one-third of the profits from the eventual sale of the house . Bankers predict that such plans , which are already popular in Florida , will soon become common elsewhere . <P> All of these methods of creative financing have risks or drawbacks . But one of these plans is often the only way that people are able to own either a dream castle or a one-bedroom condominium.
