Picking Presidents with care <P> " All the ills of democracy can be cured by more democracy , " said New York Governor and Democratic Presidential Nominee Al Smith . The remedy is worse than the disease , replies former North Carolina Governor and now Duke University President Terry Sanford . Fearing that runaway democracy has made a shambles of the presidential selection process , Sanford last week announced the formation of a new bipartisan committee to promote changes in party rules in advance of the next election campaign . " You ca n't run this nation like a town meeting , " said Sanford . " We should make the system less democratic and less chaotic . We must involve the political leadership more . We must strengthen the political parties . " <P> Sanford 's panel includes some 20 heavyweights from both major parties , among them former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie , Republican Senator Robert Dole , Carter National Campaign Chairman Robert Strauss and onetime Reagan Presidential Campaign Manager John Sears . In coming months the group will hold a series of meetings around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars , inviting contributions from politicians , journalists , campaign organizers , pollsters and anybody else with ideas about ending the current chaos . The committee hopes to build enough momentum to cause the rules committees of both parties to make changes in time for the 1984 contest . <P> Though the panel has not yet made specific recommendations , it generally favors giving convention delegates more independence , restoring a greater role for the parties , shortening the length of the campaign , reducing the importance of the primaries , and deflating the influence of special-interest groups . Says John Sears : " This is a horrible system , a terrible system . Under the current arrangement , single-issue groups can essentially blackmail a candidate . " Agrees Bob Strauss : " When national conventions are dominated by single-issue groups , the conventions do n't represent America . " <P> To add to the pressure for changing the rules , Sanford is publishing a book in June , A Danger of Democracy ( Westview Press ; 184 pages ) , analyzing the selection process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " who carefully deliberate on their choice for President . Like other critics of the present system , Sanford wants to liberate convention delegates from their rigid commitment to a particular candidate . Under the present system , the delegates have virtually no flexibility to adapt to changing political conditions once they are selected , says Sanford . " They are instructed and bound more precisely than when they were bound and driven by the bosses . " And the nominees they pick are more likely to be unrepresentative of the party 's mainstream , as in the case of George McGovern , or a Washington outsider , as was Jimmy Carter. * Or both : witness Ronald Reagan .
