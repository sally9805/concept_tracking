That ' s the word from analysts , economists , traders , and Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) ministers themselves . Many see a strong challenge to OPEC and an inevitable drop in prices over the next six months. // Some , however , see a period of stability as long as OPEC members keep below their new production ceiling of 17. 5 million barrels per day ( b. p. d . ) . The majority view holds that non-OPEC production will stay high for the rest of the year , and OPEC output will be low until the fourth quarter , in an overall framework of slack demand. // As a proportion of world consumption , OPEC production has been dropping sharply - from 62 percent in 1973 to 41 percent in 1981 to about 32 percent in February of this year. // Among non-OPEC producers , it is assumed that the Soviet Union will keep on selling as much oil as it can to raise ' ' hard ' ' ( foreign ) currency , and that Mexico will keep its production around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge external debt of about $80 billion. // Mexico , not a member of OPEC , lowered its prices to the new cartel ' s price of $29 a barrel soon after the latest OPEC agreement . But the Soviet Union cut its crude prices by as much as $2 , selling its Ural crude for between $27 and $28 . In addition , China is looking for new offshore fields . The United States does not export a great deal , but its production will stay high for domestic needs. // That leaves Britain , the fifth-largest non-OPEC , noncommunist producer in the world . Its companies have every incentive both to keep producing heavily and to see North Sea prices undercut OPEC member Nigeria. // The immediate competition to keep in mind is the one between Nigeria and Britain for markets in the US , analysts agree . Both countries sell high-quality crude oil , with Nigeria ' s slightly ' ' sweeter ' ' ( better ) . // The degree to which OPEC itself is watching Britain was indicated by how frequently OPEC ministers have been referring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 14 . At that time , OPEC agreed to cut OPEC prices to $29 a barrel and set a production ceiling of 17. 5 million barrels per day. // Sources within the British National Oil Corporation ( BNOC ) , which markets a majority of North Sea oil production for the British government , confirmed to this newspaper that the US was the market Britain did not want to lose. // When Britain failed to reduce prices at the end of last year , it lost two US buyers , including Texas Eastern , the sources said . It finally cut its price last month after the US Gulf Oil Company ( and others ) refused to buy at the old price of $33. 50 a barrel. // Pressure is still high on BNOC to cut its price again . When it went down to $30. 50 a barrel last month , Lagos felt directly threatened and at once undercut to $30 a barrel. // A major question now is whether Britain will have to undercut Nigeria again to retain US buyers . London analysts told this newspaper Britain had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yamani , concedes that if Britain does so , a price war could break out . He and other OPEC ministers have told British Energy Secretary Nigel Lawson that it is against British interests to see oil prices tumble. // They want to see Britain go down by only 50 cents a barrel to match the Nigerian price of $30. // Britain needs high oil tax revenues , but must also keep its share of the oil market . Its biggest North Sea driller , British Petroleum ( BP ) , has already broken protocol by saying publicly that North Sea oil should be between 75 cents and $1 cheaper than Nigerian crude. // BP is expected to reject the latest BNOC offer to reduce prices to $30. 50 per barrel . BNOC sources told this newspaper they hoped North Sea companies would make up their minds what they want by the week of March 21. // Britain earns almost ( STR ) 10 billion ( $15 billion ) a year from oil taxes and royalties . Peter Riddell , political editor of the Financial Times , estimates this at two-fifths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every dollar-a-barrel drop in North Sea oil prices loses the treasury between ( STR ) 350 and ( STR ) 400 million a year. // The OPEC agreement had one immediate effect in Britain : It caused major banks to cut interest rates by one-half of 1 percent . The rates had risen twice since late last year. // In the British budget anounced Tuesday , the Chancellor of the Exchequer , Sir Geoffrey Howe , warned that if oil prices fell further and seemed likely to compromise his economic strategy later in the year , he would take ' ' corrective action. ' ' // OPEC ' s new lower prices , he said , would lead to more output and jobs in Britain , but uncertainties continued and it was necessary to keep government borrowing down as a result. // Lower oil prices mean it is less economic for companies to spend heavily on developing new North Sea fields . So Sir Geoffrey announced a package of measures for the next four years worth ( STR ) 800 million ( $1. 2 billion ) . Petroleum revenue tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be abolished , and the advanced petroleum revenue tax abolished by 1986. // Oil companies gave the measures a cautious welcome. // Meanwhile , Sir Geoffrey moved to earn back some of these losses from consumers by increasing taxes on gasoline by 4 pence ( 6 cents ) a gallon , bringing top-grade gasoline to about ( STR ) 1. 73 ( $2. 62 ) a gallon. // ' ' If the North Sea price does go down , don ' t just watch Nigeria ' s answer , but keep an eye on Libya and Algeria as well , ' ' says Dr. Paul Stevens , lecturer in oil economics at the University of Surrey. // Taking a different view is David Johnson , oil analyst for the British stockbrokers Wood MacKenzie based in Edinburgh , who sees a period of price stability ahead. // In a telephone interview , Mr. Johnson agreed that Nigerian crude oil , at $30 a barrel , had the edge over North Sea oil in the US at the moment. // Nigeria was closer to the US than the North Sea and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was higher . Normally Nigerian oil should cost $2 more than Arab light crude , but today was only $1 more - a bargain. // ' ' That means , ' ' he went on , ' ' that Nigeria should easily reach its new OPEC quota of 1. 3 million barrels per day . That in turn will reassure the Nigerian government , and could lead to it agreeing to put its price up again toward the end of the year. ' ' // Sheikh Yamani made the same point after the March 14 OPEC announcement . He hoped that Algeria and Libya would be ready at the same time to talk about lifting their own prices , now set at $30. 50 a barrel. // If Nigeria obeys the 1. 3 million b. p. d. quota , buyers who want more will go to the North Sea. // Dr. Stevens is not convinced . ' ' It ' s all up for grabs now , ' ' he said. // ' ' If Nigeria does manage to achieve its 1. 3 million b. p. d. quota , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , Nigerian , Algerian , and Libyan oil all compete with the North Sea .
