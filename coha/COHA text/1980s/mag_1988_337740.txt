The five-story structure was painted a dark shade of green , but to the people of Ebitsuka it was ominously known as the burakku biru , the black building . Ebitsuka wanted nothing to do with the place or with those who called it headquarters . Across the street , the citizens erected a two-level shack and videotaped everyone who came in and out , men in flashy suits , dark glasses and short-cropped hair , with hints of multicolored tattoos snaking out on forearms . <P> In Japan , this is the unmistakable mobsterish getup of the yakuza , the country 's version of the Mafia . In Ebitsuka , a neighborhood in the city of Hamamatsu ( pop . 514,000 ) , about 130 miles southwest of Tokyo , the gangsters did not take kindly to the scrutiny , often loudly threatening the surveillance teams ; one once approached the shack with a sword . Undaunted , the townsfolk gathered outside the burakku biru to chant " Get out ! Seek an honorable life ! " <P> The yakuza , who trace their origins to unemployed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition . Numbering perhaps 86,000 and divided among 3,100 clans , they account for a third of those accused of murder and 60% of those arrested for blackmail . But towns faced with an intruding clan usually resign themselves to coexistence . <P> Not the 970 families who live in Ebitsuka . The struggle began in 1985 , when the Ichiriki Ikka ( the One-Power Family ) set up headquarters in the green building . Besides monitoring visitors , the residents of Ebitsuka sent 1,500 protest postcards to Tetsuya Aono , chief of the Ichiriki Ikka , demanding that he and his cohort of 110 leave town . Shop owners refused to sell goods to the yakuza . After Ebitsuka lodged a lawsuit against Aono , says Eiichiro Mizuno , a local mechanic , " the gangsters began showing their fangs . " A young mobster screamed obscenities at Mizuno and smashed the windows of his house . Later , a gang member strode up to Ebitsuka 's lawyer , Yoshihiro Mitsui , in a coffee shop and stabbed him , puncturing his lung . Another activist was slashed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anti-yakuza campaign . Others saw the problem as too big for one town to solve and argued for detente . But most pressed on with the harassment campaign . Said Haruji Toyoda , 61 , a leader of the movement : " You had to overcome fear . If not , people would have said that we too lost out to violence . " <P> The gangster attacks attracted national media attention . The local police force of eight was augmented by 300 officers from other communities . Hamamatsu set up a special 120-man police task force to guard against illegal activities by gangsters . Gradually , about half the clan 's members were put in jail or placed under detention . <P> Last month Gang Lord Aono agreed to an out-of-court settlement in which the Ichiriki Ikka abandoned the burakku biru . Said Toyoda : " They did not want to stir up trouble for gangsters elsewhere . " Happy residents gathered outside the hated building and removed the anti-yakuza banners . Amid the celebration , a few expressed reservations . Said Mizuno : " We do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yakuza go , they are not likely to forget Ebitsuka.
