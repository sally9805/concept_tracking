WASHINGTON  --  The House Armed Services Committee approved a defense authorization bill that would trim the Pentagon ' s total request only $6 billion but would set different priorities for weapons procurement and research . The $306 billion defense bill passed by the committee would sharply reduce Pentagon requests for the Strategic Defense Initiative anti-missile research program , anti-satellite projects and development of a system for transporting MX missiles by rail . But the committee also recommended higher spending for the purchase of M-1 battle tanks , Apache attack helicopters and Bradley infantry vehicles . The bill is for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 . If enacted , the panel ' s reordering would restore some of the budget authority that the Army had been steadily losing to the Navy and the Air Force . The House is certain to reduce the overall defense authorization further in view of its approval of a budget resolution that would cap military spending at $288. 7 billion . Rep. Les Aspin ( D. Wis. ) , chairman of the Armed Services Committee , said he will propose amending the bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full House opens its debate on defense spending in early May . One part of the bill that is likely to stand in any event would require the administration to stick to the so-called " narrow " interpretation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile , or ABM , treaty . That view has strong support in the Senate , and already the administration ' s resolve to push through a " broad " interpretation is weakening . The broad interpretation would give the U.S. more freedom to test lasers and other futuristic anti-missile defenses . The committee reduced by 33% the Pentagon ' s $5. 7 billion request for SDI , the largest single weapons program . It also reduced an administration request for 21 MX missiles to 12 . The panel also took 60% off the administration ' s request for $591 million to develop a rail system to carry 50 MX missiles that are yet to be ordered . However , the committee approved the administration ' s $2. 2 billion request for the smaller and less controversial Midgetman missiles . The panel also recommended funds to build two more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1. 9 billion for 72 of the submarines ' missiles . Mr. Aspen ' s committee showed its dissatisfaction with the trouble-plagued B-1 bomber by slashing 34% from a $841 million request for improvements . It trimmed the authorization for another troubled Air Force project , the Amraam air-to-air missile , by 18% to $683 million . A strong lobbying campaign by McDonnell Douglas Corp. paid off when the committee recommended a 16% increase in the $745 million that the Army requested to buy the company ' s Apache helicopters . The committee also added 120 to the 600 M1 tanks sought by the Army . The committee approved funding for starting up two new Nimitz-class nuclear-powered carriers and recommended the building of five Aegis cruisers and no destroyers in place of a Navy request for three cruisers and two destroyers . The committee said its package would save building costs . It wasn ' t clear how lawmakers will trim $17 billion from the Armed Services committee bill to fit it within the budget resolution ' s cap . Mr. Aspin warned that the House may have to use " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards without seriously impairing critical weapons systems .
