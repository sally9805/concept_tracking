By 1972 , when the Antiballistic Missile Treaty sharply limited all such work , the quest had produced advances not only in conventional interceptors but in such exotic devices as particle beam and laser weapons. // The story of these early efforts has been lost in the uproar over President Reagan ' s plan , known officially as the Strategic Defense Initiative . Yet detractors and defenders of " Star Wars " agree that this neglected history is crucial to understanding the international debate that has heated up in the wake of the Iceland summit meeting , which ended without agreement when Mr. Reagan refused the Soviet demand for limits on " Star Wars " testing. // The current debate centers on the interpretation of small sections of the 1972 treaty , whose overall intent was to ban nationwide antimissile defenses. // Detractors of " Star Wars , " including some of the treaty ' s drafters , say the treaty marked the culmination of long years of failed antimissile research . The futile expenditure of billions of dollars , they say , showed the goal was unattainable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eliminate not only ABM systems already in existence but also those on the horizon. // " We saw what was coming , " said John B. Rhinelander , legal adviser to negotiators of the ABM treaty and a leading " Star Wars " critic . " We tried to do an end run around lasers and that kind of thing. " // Defenders of " Star Wars " disagree , saying progress in top-secret technology in the 1950 ' s and 1960 ' s was considerable and that the 1972 treaty specifically exempted the development and testing of exotic projects such as those now at the forefront of Mr. Reagan ' s program. // " It doesn ' t cover the new technologies , " said James T. Hackett , a former Reagan Administration official now at the Heritage Foundation , a conservative research organization in Washington . The treaty had a loophole , he said , " to take cognizance of the fact that there were lasers out there. " // No matter how much experts differ on the meaning of the ABM treaty , both sides agree that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more advanced than is generally realized . The history of ABM development illuminates the positions and assumptions of both sides , they say. // The story starts in the late 1940 ' s as American military planners struggled to cope with the threat posed by Soviet long-range bombers carrying nuclear weapons . One interceptor deployed widely throughout the United States in the early 1950 ' s was the Nike missile , named after the winged Greek goddess of victory . Nike was to explode upon striking bombers. // By the mid 1950 ' s , the cost of such " air defense " interceptors reached $30 billion a year . Then , in 1957 , the Soviet Union tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile . No air-defense weapon was fast enough or accurate enough to stop a speeding warhead from space. // In response to the new ICBM threat , the Eisenhower Administration cut back on defenses against bombers and embarked on a huge , two-track program of antiballistic missile research . One track aimed to upgrade Nike interceptors , radars and computers to try to match the new threat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new antimissile techniques and technologies. // " Project Defender " got under way in 1958 as a top-secret , multimillion-dollar venture involving thousands of the nation ' s best scientists . One proposal was to destroy Soviet missiles early in flight with Ballistic Missile Boost Intercepts - Bambi. // The scientists envisioned Bambi as hundreds of space-based battle stations using infrared sensors to track the fiery exhaust of enemy missiles . The Bambi weapon itself , propelled by rockets , would simply smash into the rising enemy missile . To increase the chance of a direct hit , the Bambi weapon would release a 60-foot rotating wire net laced with deadly steel pellets . Components were tested on Atlas and Titan missiles. // " If we went that far , that fast , with a primitive industrial base , I hesitate to think what we could do today , " said John T. Bosma , an expert on Project Defender who participated in the 1982 High Frontier study that helped pave the way for the " Star Wars " plan . The study drew heavily on the Bambi proposal. // In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Projects Agency , ARPA , decided to explore what they envisioned as the most futuristic arm of all , a new device known as the laser . " Everybody at APRA was electrified at the thought of being able to create a controlled beam of light of great power , " said Dr. Gordon Gould , a scientist who succeeded in building one of the world ' s first lasers in 1961 under a top-secret ARPA contract . He said the Pentagon wanted to see if lasers could be used as " radars " that could pinpoint enemy missiles and as " light guns. " // By March 1962 , Gen. Curtis E. LeMay , Air Force Chief of Staff , was predicting the development of " directed energy weapons " such as lasers that would " strike with the speed of light " to destroy missiles. // As antimissile work forged ahead in the early 1960 ' s , Pentagon planners prepared for manned space missions that could perform surveillance and attacks . The candidate vehicle , a winged forerunner to the space shuttle , got the go-ahead in 1960 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in 1962 six Air Force pilots were selected to test it in flight . Like the shuttle , Dynasoar and its successors were designed to carry large antimissile payloads into space. // Pentagon planners also began a Satellite Inspection , or Saint , program in which a beam of electrons would be fired from an unmanned Saint vehicle into an enemy target . Emissions from the target would show if it carried a hydrogen bomb . The top-secret idea , perfected in April 1962 , was declassified in March 1982. // As some scientists raced ahead on such exotic projects as Bambi and Saint , others worked on the more conventional goal of perfecting ground-based interceptor missiles . One was Nike-Zeus . It was to carry a one-megaton nuclear warhead , which would ease the job of destroying enemy missiles . The prime contractor was the telephone company ' s respected research arm , A.T. &; T. Bell Laboratories . Bell Labs had the most difficult job of all : to find a way of guiding Nike-Zeus interceptors toward their targets . About a third of the Nike-Zeus test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antimissile quest was under fire from critics who said it was fundamentally flawed . They argued that an enemy , rather than building defenses , would always find it cheaper and easier to outwit antimissile systems - by simply deploying decoys among speeding warheads , for example . The critics centered their attack on Nike-Zeus. // " By the time it is ready , the technology of attack may have pulled far ahead , making the defense instrument obsolete , " said Dr. Ralph E. Lapp , a physicist and Pentagon consultant , in his 1962 book , " Kill and Overkill . " He said it would cost about $60 billion to deploy Nike-Zeus , whose main beneficiaries would be some 80 aerospace companies. // And it was becoming clear that zeroing in on missiles in space was more difficult than expected . One solution was to replace Bambi ' s spinning nets with nuclear warheads whose explosions in space would knock out targets miles away . One study , conducted by Lockheed , envisoned 3 , 000 nuclear battle stations in orbit , each armed with a four-megaton warhead. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , " said Saunders B. Kramer , a former Lockheed engineer. // But antimissile scientists soon discovered a strange new complication . On a warm evening in July 1962 , the United States exploded a 1. 4-megaton warhead 248 miles above Johnston Atoll , a tiny speck in the Pacific about 800 miles southwest of Hawaii . It was the first large antimissile test in space of nuclear weapons. // " All of a sudden a greenish-white flash lit up all of Hawaii , " recalled an eyewitness . " The sky started turning pink , then orange , then red . The heavens were filled with a ghastly light. " // Street lights and power lines suddenly broke down , and burglar alarms started ringing . The Hawaiian electrical systems had been knocked out of whack . Later , scientists dubbed this strange effect the Electromagnetic Pulse , or EMP . A bomb exploded high above Nebraska , they decided , would cause a coast-to-coast EMP , knocking out computers , radars , and communications . Bombs exploded on the ground cause no such problems. // By 1963 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quest . It canceled Dynasoar and some of the more exotic antimissile projects . It also turned Nike-Zeus into the Nike-X research program , which aimed to intercept enemy warheads not in space but in the earth ' s atmosphere after light-weight decoys had a chance to burn up. // But in 1967 , partially in response to antimissile developments in the Soviet Union , the Johnson Administration announced it would build the Sentinel ABM system of ground-based interceptor rockets tipped with nuclear warheads . It was the first Presidential proposal for a nationwide defense . While acknowledging its limits for blunting a full-scale Soviet attack , planners said it could slow a " light " strike . The project was managed by the Army. // Also in 1967 , the Navy began to study a system known as Sabmis , for Seaborne Anti-Ballistic Missile Intercept System . Fired from ships and submarines located as close as possible to the Arctic Circle , these interceptors were to knock out enemy missiles as they flew over the North Pole. // Not to be outdone , the Air Force in 1968 began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planes to defend American coastal cities from attack by enemy submarines. // In 1969 , the Nixon Administration halted the interservice rivalry by scrapping the whole idea of trying to defend cities . Instead it refocused the Army ' s Sentinel program to defense of only missile silos . The new program was known as Safeguard. // Up to that point , antimissile defense had been only research and development , tests and prototypes , hopes and dreams . But in 1970 the engineers prepared to " bend metal. " // At the same time , Washington and Moscow had begun to talk about halting the antimissile arms race . Despite progress in all kinds of weaponry , both superpowers had decided that antimissile systems were futile , costly and provocative . First , they reasoned , the technology was inadequate . Second , the move to antimissile defenses would touch off an expensive new round of offensive weaponry meant to try to penetrate those defenses . Finally , defenses threatened to upset the tension that had long kept an uneasy peace between East and West. // On the American side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on advanced technology , whose promise always seemed to recede on the horizon . " The basic ideas of particle beams were understood back in the 1960 ' s , " said Spurgeon M. Keeny , a Nixon Administration official involved in the ABM treaty negotiations. // The 1972 treaty limited Washington and Moscow to a token force of 200 antiballistic missiles each , split evenly between two sites . Two years later , the two sides agreed to limit themselves to one site with 100 interceptors. // In 1975 , warheads were fitted atop interceptors of the $7 billion Safeguard system , at the allowed site , built at the very northern edge of North Dakota . Safeguard was put in operation on April 1. // Soon after the Safeguard site came to life , Congress voted to close it down because of high cost and ineffectiveness . It was deactivated in 1976 . The Russians have kept their ABM system in operation , ringed around Moscow. // In the late 1970 ' s , however , several factors conspired to renew interest in large-scale antimissile systems . First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategic missiles were becoming vulnerable to a surprise Soviet attack , and a belief that ABM systems might protect at least some American missiles . Second , while critics of ABM systems continued to assert that they were bound to be flawed , costly and dangerous , military scientists kept reporting steady technical progress in the construction of lasers , particle beams and other exotic technologies. // This interest culminated in President Reagan ' s " Star Wars " speech of March 23 , 1983 , in which he called on the nation ' s scientists to renew the vigor of their antimissile quest . Soon testing picked up . In the 1984 Homing Overlay Experiment or HOE , the Army fired an earth-based interceptor at a mock warhead , destroying it with a weapon reminiscent of Bambi . The interceptor had been launched from a fixed ABM test range , as permitted by the ABM treaty. // In 1985 , however , debate heated up over just how far the Administration could go in testing new kinds of antimissile devices without violating the treaty , which said the parties pledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems or components which are sea-based , air-based , space-based , or mobile-land-based . " The American negotiators of the treaty said it ruled out tests of space-based devices like Bambi. // But experts at the State and Defense Departments came up with what they call the " broad " interpretation , focusing in particular on " Agreed Statement D " of the ABM treaty. // " The parties agree , " Statement D says , " that in the event ABM systems based on other physical principles and including components capable of substituting for ABM interceptor missiles , ABM launchers , or ABM radars are created in the future , specific limitations on such systems and their components would be subject to discussion. " // Mr. Hackett , the former Reagan Administration official now at the Heritage Foundation , said : " In theory , the President can develop , test and even produce systems " to be based in space , " just so long as they aren ' t deployed. " // For example , the " broad " interpretation holds that a $1 billion " Star Wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not violate the treaty when , in the 1990 ' s , its beam of concentrated light flashes into space and is bounced off an orbiting mirror to test its ability to destroy Soviet missiles . In contrast , the " narrow " interpretation of the treaty , put forth by the framers themselves , holds that the laser can be shot into space , but not bounced off the mirror. // " With space systems , by nature , you ' re trying to defend the whole country , " said Dr. Raymond L. Garthoff , who was executive secretary of the ABM delegation in the early 1970 ' s and today is an analyst at the Brookings Institution . " We were well aware of that . It was our intention to ban defenses for the country as a whole. " // The " narrow " interpretation says Agreed Statement D is not a loophole but an open-ended statement meant to gather all possible technical strides under the umbrella of the ABM treaty . The Administration says it is currently abiding by the " narrow " interpretation. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long history of antimissile research figures in the dispute over the feasibility of ABM goals. // " The moral of the story is that people tend to grotesquely overrate the difficulties " of the Strategic Defense Initiative , said Mr. Bosma , the Project Defender expert . " Some of the technologies we developed back then were amazing. " // But Mr. Kramer , formerly a Lockheed engineer , said : " My feeling today is that this whole thing is entirely too complex . The Soviets have 10 , 000 warheads . Let ' s say we get 90 percent of them . That ' s still 1 , 000 getting through. " // Although " Star Wars " advocates disagree , the ABM framers say the immense power of nuclear weapons will continue to hold the upper hand in the future . They remain unswayed by recent tests of antimissile prowess. // " Over the past three years I haven ' t seen anything that makes me think technology is the way out of the nuclear dilemma , " said Mr. Rhinelander , the legal adviser to the ABM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical defense . Nuclear weapons are too powerful and too widespread . The fundamentals haven ' t changed one whit. " //
