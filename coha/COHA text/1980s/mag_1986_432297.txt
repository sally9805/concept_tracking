 |p466  FROM THE SEA Puluwat is everyman 's dream of paradise : an island set in the blue depths of the Pacific , ringed by a coral reef that encloses a crystal clear lagoon . Ashore it looks like a garden , with towering coconut palms lining the broad sandy paths and great old breadfruit trees , their roots clutching the earth like gnarled fists , rising majestically above the green banana and taro patches . And the people . The men bare to the sun save for their thus , a bright swath of cotton stretched tight between the legs and tied around the waist with loose ends swinging . The women in long skirts , their breasts uncovered , bending low in obeisance whenever they meet older males . The youngest children , naked . It was like this on Puluwat , one of the Caroline Islands , 18 years ago when the people held a feast to bid 21-year-old John Uruo farewell . Related by blood and extended family to most of the islanders , John at his leave-taking drew a large crowd , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fried fish , boiled breadfruit , taro root and leaf cooked in coconut milk , small sweet bananas , and coconut wine .

In good health , John had a plan to overcome the others . He would go to college in the United States ? the first from his island to do so . Aided by a scholarship , John succeeded He graduated from Minnesota 's Bemis : : : State University , married an American Qi- : and eventually returned to Truk in the Federated States of Micronesia , where I met him .

Havinz jumped over the wall himself , John Uruo now helps others do the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups known athe Marshalls , the Carolines , and the Northern Marianas , in a part of the world called Micronesia . The islands sprinkle a vast ocean kingdom about the size of the continental United States but with less land area than the state of Rhode Island and a population of only 160,000 . Today the islands are emerging into the light of self-government , taking their places on the world stage after nearly 40 years as a trust territory administered by the United @#  |p467  States under United Nations auspices . In May the United Nations Trusteeship Council recommended to dissolve this last trusteeship . The dissolution now awaits a Security Council vote , which will formalize the new arrangements . Under new flags , the Marshalls in the east and Palau , a group of islands in the western Carolines , have voted to be republics , while the other islands in the chain have united as the Federated States of Micronesia ? Kosrae , Pohnpei , Truk , and Yap . Although self-governing , all three nations are to be closely tied to the United States by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. constitutional practice . Under the compact the U. S. will apportion among the three a total of 2.7 billion dollars , including adjustment for inflation , over a period of 1S years . ( Palau 's compact , presently being contested in Palau 's Supreme Court , would run for SO years but after the 15th year would be funded out of a 70-million-dollar investment fund . ) In addition the U. S will continue to provide airline and airport-safety services , public health and weather prediction , currency , an international postal service , and disaster relief . For the Republic of the Marshall Islands , where on Bikini and Enewetak Atolls nuclear devices were tested from 1946 to 1958 , the U. S. has agreed to set up a 150-milliondollar trust fund to benefit islanders affected by the tests . * Finally , the United States assumes all responsibility for the defense of the three states , asking in exchange that they remain closed to the military forces of other nations unless the U. S. agrees otherwise . The fourth group in the Trust Territory of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even closer bond with the U. S. , the status of a commonwealth . Its residents receive regular benefits from a wide range of U. S. government agencies , and their territorial government is given financial grants for special needs . Ultimately they will become U. S. citizens . EVERYWHERE on my travels I looked for such walls as John had leapt and found many still standing . Others are crumbling , and some have disappeared . But I found that I too had to jump over a wall , the wall of my own ignorance about the area . Pipe-smoking and patient , Sam McPhetres came to my aid . Archivist for the trust territory government , he recounted how the islands were settled in prehistory by intrepid peoples who sailed there from Southeast Asia . After the region 's discovery by Europeans ? Magellan came through in the 1520s ? trouble followed . Spain , claiming everything , lost everything in the Spanish-American War of 1898 . The United States took Guam and the Philippines as territories ; Spain sold the other islands to Germany , which lost them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under a League of Nations mandate , Japan energetically colonized and cultivated the islands until World War II , when the United States got them the hard way , with the lives of its fighting men . In 1947 the U. S. Navy set about administering the islands as a United Nations trust territory ; the U. S. Department of the Interior took over the administration in 1951 . " But it was not quite that simple , " said Sam . " Having fought our way across the Pacific , island by bloody island , our country wanted to be sure they would never again be used against us . The territory was declared a strategic trust , ' a status that gave us the right to fortify it with military bases and close off certain areas if necessary . " In fact , " said Sam , " we 're sitting in one of those once closed-off areas right now . " His office in Saipan , the administrative center of the trust territory and capital of the Northern Marianas , was built in the 1950s by the Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex for training Chinese Nationalist troops to operate inside the Communist-ruled homeland . The Kwajalein Missile Range in the Republic of the Marshall Islands is another case in point . With the 600 native people moved out , " Kwaj " harbors 3,000 American civilians in a 900-acre setting that most resembles a golfing condominium complex in , say , the state of Florida ( pages 472-3 ) . But the purpose of the island 's development is far from frivolous . Situated at one end of the world 's largest atoll , Kwaj is the 4  |p470  Pacific terminus of a U. S. missile range , where experts measure the splashdown accuracy of ballistic rockets fired from Vandenberg Air Force Base , 4,500 miles away in California . The facility is expected to play an important part should President Reagan 's " Star Wars " technology go forward . For the use of Kwajalein and the other islands in the missile range , the United States pays a rent of more than 10 million dollars a year . The money goes to the Republic of the Marshall Islands , chiefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on nearby Ebeye . Many work on Kwajalein , commuting to some 600 jobs there . " SLUM OF THE PACIFIC , " I had heard Ebeye called , but , even so , I was unprepared for its squalor when I arrived at dusk from Kwaj . Along a pocked asphalt lane , houses of sheet metal and cinder block crowded wall-to-wall with no space for grass or trees . Bands of children , some mere toddlers , ranged the street , their only playground on the 78-acre island where 8,000 people live ( pages 474-5 ) . Spotting me , the youngsters crowded around , incessantly calling " Hello . " The next day I visited the hospital and met the public health nurse . To the question " How are things ? " she answered : " How can I make a progress report to the United Nations when there is no progress ? We need help ! Today , for example , we have no insulin . " A serious matter when at least a third of the adult population on Ebeye , as elsewhere in urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetics and diet . Making the steamy rounds of the several dimly lit , unair-conditioned , and expensive grocery stores , I found Ebeye lacked other things : fresh meat and fish , fresh fruits , fresh vegetables . In the freezer of the largest store there were only a few chickens and two cans of orange juice . The next day I strolled about neighboring Kwajalein , where the banning of passenger cars gives streets over to the pleasantries of bicycles and foot traffic . The shops were filled with the plenty of their stateside counterparts . And as with U. S. military commissaries worldwide , they were off-limits to the natives who work on the base . I noted three playing fields on Kwaj , a bowling alley , swimming pool , and golf course . The bulletin board announced the Commodore 's Ball up at the Yacht Club , $17.50 a person for cocktails , petit filet mignon , and dancing under the stars . I was glad my fellow Americans had such a good life on Kwajalein . But I wondered about the stark contrast on Ebeye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why the terrible crowding ? It 's due , they say , to the traditions of the people and their belief in the extended family . For example , if you are in need and a relative is getting rent money or good wages from Uncle Sam , you move in with the relative . And why no insulin in the hospital ? From Majuro , capital of the Republic of the Marshall Islands , the secretary of health services sends word : " Ebeye never out of insulin. " @#  |p471  Other officials agreed . Who to believe ? High prices and poor selection of food ? It is explained that the merchants on Majuro supply Ebeye 's shops and do n't appreciate subsidized U. S. competition from Kwaj . And what about the scant water and electricity ? I 'm told that new plants will be finished this year . Shortly after I left the Marshall Islands , the U. S. use agreements on Kwaj expired , and some of the landowners occupied several islands on the missile range , asserting their right to the land and demanding significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that uncertain period , the U. S. Congress enacted the Compact of Free Association , which will provide to the Marshall Islands government nearly 400 million dollars over 30 years for payment to the Kwajalein landowners in direct income and for projects . Their development plan calls for a causeway to link Ebeye to six other islands , new roads , elementary schools , a high school , renovated housing , and a new dock . Hope for Ebeye rises as the walls that enclose it promise to fall . ALTHOUGH EBEYE is in the worstcase category , its problems are shared to some extent throughout the trust territory . Despite an immense flow of American money , effort , and goodwill , many islands still suffer from a shortage of water and power , poor to nonexistent roads , struggling educational systems , meager public services , few job opportunities , limited natural resources , and , at the top of the list , inadequate health care . Much blame must be laid to the region 's geography , especially difficult when it comes to delivering adequate health services . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is supposed to have a health aide , operating out of a well-equipped dispensary , with access to a radio in the event of an emergency . In a life-or-death situation a patient is picked up by boat or plane , if possible , and taken to the nearest hospital , often hundreds of miles away , or to Hawaii . The bill can be astronomical . And it is paid for by the government . The Republic of the Marshall Islands is going broke trying to meet the cost of modern medicine . When I was in Majuro , it was reported in the press that the republic 's department of health had overspent its budget , and that all other departments would be cut to provide the necessary funds . I asked President Amata Kabua about the story , and , sadly , he admitted that it was true . " But what are we to do ? " he appealed to me . " We are a Christian nation . We ca n't simply allow people to die when doctors in Honolulu can save their lives . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Lonny Higgins , a gynecologist , and her lawyer husband , David , expects to address this very problem with its specially designed sailing ship , equipped with the latest in medical technology . The Higginses plan to enlist doctors and nurses for limited volunteer service . Sailing among the islands , they will use their diagnostic , surgical , and treatment skills , while teaching preventive medicine . I accompanied the Higginses on a medical excursion to Arno Atoll , a three-hour motorboat trip from Majuro . We arrived at Ine at twilight , but already a huge full moon had risen , creamy white in a gray-blue void . Lonny 's supplies went from our motorboat to a rowboat and finally into our arms as we waded ashore through the gentle surf . A 15-minute stroll down a rutted lane brought us to the dispensary , where we discovered that the health aide was off-island , taking a refresher course in Majuro . The dispensary was far from clean . The refrigerator did n't function for lack of electric power on the island . The broken toilet was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few supplies included a cream for burns , a clamp for an umbilical cord , test tapes for diabetes , vitamins for pregnancy . The single bed even lacked a mattress . My husband , Pat , and I headed for the beach , where we unrolled our mats and slept under a full moon . Then about 3:30 a. m. we awoke in eerie darkness . Totally unexpected to us , with the impact of a miracle , there was a magnificent full eclipse of the moon . The next day , stripped to the waist in the terrible heat , David Higgins scrubbed down the dispensary walls while Lonny drew simple , colorful pictures of the human reproductive organs as a way of teaching her patients . Then they 4 p 476 began arriving . That day , assisted by three women who had come with us from Majuro ? a public health nurse , a social worker , and Jinnie deBrum , a Marshallese member of the Marimed Board ? Dr. Lonny Higgins examined 27 women . She discovered a pelvic mass , a thyroid abnormality , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hawaii for testing , six signaled follow-up tests . And that night another seeming miracle transpired . As darkness fell , we heard singing and saw a procession of lanterns swinging down the road . The island chief and a laughing crowd of women and children had come bearing gifts of bananas , fish , pork , and breadfruit . And time slipped away in dancing , singing , and speeches from a host of grateful hearts . MOVING EVER WEST , we flew to Kosrae , one of the four Federated States of Micronesia , where in the 19th century diseases brought by traders and American whalers nearly wiped out the native community . Incidentally , I was told that the seagoing visitors of that day so habitually uttered a certain four-letter expletive that islanders gave all white people the name " ohshits . " When the Congregational missionaries arrived , Kosraeans flocked to Christianity . Now the church , clinging to past-century strictness , is Kosrae 's most powerful force . Women are modestly clothed ? bathing suits are too risque , even for visitors ? and Sundays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneficial , as we saw upon arrival on Kosrae 's enormous new jet runway ( pages 478-9 ) , a legacy of the trusteeship and big enough for 727s , although such planes have yet to be scheduled through Kosrae . We were met by Madison Nena , Kosrae 's 34-year-old director of tourism , and Christopher O'Connor , a 25-year-old Peace Corps volunteer assigned to develop tourism . Slender and dark with a neatly trimmed mustache , Chris , a hotelier , came to Kosrae from New York City 's Waldorf Astoria , where he worked in guest services . Aside from the island 's beauty the major sight is the Le1uh ruins , whose huge stone walls , canals , and kings ' tombs speak of a highly developed culture that flourished 500 years ago . Teddy John , Kosrae 's historic preservation director , guided us through the jumble of stone , still in private hands and littered with beer cans . A burly man with black hair and beard , Teddy spoke with deep regret about the condition of the ruins and of his hope that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When I was a boy , water still flowed through the canals , and I could dive off the walls , " Teddy told us . " If  |p477  we could dredge the canals , we could make the place look like the old days . " When Leluh was at its height , the king and high chiefs owned all the land and lived with their servants in this city of more than a hundred walled compounds . The compounds of royalty were used for burial as well as worship of Kosraean gods . " Those gods must have been really powerful , " Teddy said with a smile , " because Kosraean legend claims that magic moved these stones , since the people had no machines to transport such heavy material . " Teddy invited us to dinner at his tworoom , concrete-floored home , where we met his wife , nine children , and a lively group of Americans , mostly government advisers , who like to hang out at Teddy 's . Teddy is an admiring listener to the swirling conversation . " I learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is , in fact , an intellectual but is too innocent and modest to discern it . Thirteen Americans on the island are in the U. S. Army , part of a Civic Action Team . They live at spick-and-span Camp Wilbur L. Trahan and work on civic projects such as road and bridge construction , government buildings , and school playgrounds . Everybody is invited to their monthly outdoor movies . Hundreds find help from " Doc , " their medical corpsman . The team 's Doc , Sgt. Leonard Resler from Boulder City , Nevada , explained : " Each Civic Action Team stays for six months , and we 're getting ready to pull out , but I am grateful for this experience . I have the feeling that we have really helped . " THE SAME FEELING prevails at The Village , a hotel in Pohnpei that employs some 50 neighbors to serve guests in but 21 rooms . By employing a large staff only part-time , the innovative American owner-managers , Bob and Patti Arthur , run a first-class hotel while recognizing native habits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Patti . " They also need time for their pattern of living . A funeral , for example , takes four days . " The Village demonstrates how tourism might proceed in today 's Micronesia . Built on a hillside , the hotel rises in a tropical garden with an open-sided dining , bar , and lobby area . Positioned for privacy , thatchroofed guest cottages are screened to permit the full sweep of Pacific breezes . The island 's town , Kolonia , is capital of the state of Pohnpei as well as capital of the Federated States of Micronesia . Although a new FSM capitol building is in the planning stage , the seat of government at present is in the remodeled Navy hospital , a one-story frame left from the 1940s . The national congress meets in the old operating room ; the president 's office was the children 's ward . Calling on President Tosiwo Nakayama , I learned the story of his life ? another tale of walls and extraordinary effort to scale them . Nakayama 's father was a Japanese businessman sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl from the island of Ulul in the Namonuito Atoll . When the Pacific war broke out , the family , now with several children , settled on Dublon in Truk Lagoon , Japanese headquarters . It was from Dublon , at the age of nine , that young Tosiwo heard the " ominous , incessant , ever louder drone " of the U. S. airplanes that sank a Japanese fleet of 60 naval and cargo vessels . * At the end of the war the United States sent home all the Japanese nationals living in Micronesia , including the elder Nakayama . Deprived of his father , the young Tosiwo took on the responsibility of his family . He went to work and earned enough money to take his mother and sisters back to her relatives on Ulul . Only then , at 16 , did Tosiwo voice his ambition : " I want to go to school . " He had never spent a day in a classroom up to that time . Nakayama eventually went to the University of Hawaii on a U. S. government scholarship , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was set on the track of leadership . What kind of influences shaped the young Nakayama , I wondered . I decided to visit the island of his mother 's people , Ulul ? a resolve that sent me on the unforgettable voyage of the Micro Dawn . All the outer islands in Micronesia are supposed to be regularly served by such ships , sent by the various governments to deliver supplies 477  |p486  and people and pick up island produce ? copra , woven mats , handmade rope , and the like . The trips last from one to three weeks , depending on distance . Sam McPhetres warned me : " All field trips are late getting off , all take longer than expected , and there is no regular schedule . " On a tight schedule myself , I had hoped for a one-week trip out of Moen , the capital of Truk , and was assured that I would have it . Sam volunteered to go along . And the governor of Truk assigned John Uruo to accompany us , my first meeting with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE SAILING DAY we moved on board the Micro Dawn and watched it being loaded . Into the forward cargo hold went the stock for island customers to buy after they had acquired some cash from the sale of their copra . Into the main hold went box after box of canned goods and other foodstuffs from the United States : sweet potatoes , peaches , evaporated milk , soy sauce , mixed vegetables , shortening , green beans , and huge bags of rice , flour , and sugar ? much of it destined for the school-lunch program . Then came the passengers , the men in their thus with sleeping mats and lethallooking machetes ; the women with coconutfrond-wrapped parcels of food and bags of coconuts for drinking ; the children , racing madly around the ship . The cabin passengers were a dedicated little band of government people working to bring some services to the islands : two educators testing students , a nutritionist checking on school food programs , a health officer examining needs of the handicapped , and a young American physician , Dr. Don Preston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Public Health Service , accompanied by a health aide . They would inoculate the infants and tackle any medical problem that arose . Another cabin passenger , Father John Fahey , a Jesuit , joined us at railside . He ministers to the people of Pulap , Tamatam , Puluwat , and Pulusuk , an island group in Truk state collectively called the Westerns . " But is n't the Micro Dawn going to Namonuito ? " I inquired . " Yes , but after the Westerns , " replied the priest . And sure enough , that night we sailed for Pulap , home island of the ship 's captain . I tried to see things as philosophically as Father Fahey , who laughingly explained : " Out here we are constantly faced with either a crisis or an emergency . We are often chagrined but not surprised . " We stayed at Pulap four days , living out a pattern that would repeat itself at each stop . Outside the island 's encircling reef the Micro Dawn launched two deck boats with outboard motors that shuttled back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaping from a ladder on the side of the ship into a small boat as it bobbed up and down in the heavy swells , hoping not to fall into the sea and attract the four enormous sharks that hung around the stern feeding on ship 's garbage . On the island the men loaded copra onto the boats while the women barbecued a delicacy , turkey tails , bought frozen from ship 's stores . The doctor set up a clinic , and the government people went about their respective assignments . We sailed for Tamatam , 15 minutes away , and spent another two days ? a delay that killed any prospect of reaching the rest of the Westerns , much less Ulul , in the hoped-for span of a week . So , we radioed Moen to send a chartered boat to pick us up at Puluwat , the Micro Dawn 's next stop , and were told that a 40-foot fishing boat , Miss Namonuito , would come . Then on to Puluwat , where John Uruo was clearly a star as the local boy who made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peace Corps volunteer , who told me a story . After a 1982 cholera epidemic in Truk , a campaign to provide all the islanders with latrines got under way . Eric himself helped install 60 of them . " I spoke to each family , emphasizing the importance of toilets to everyone 's health , " Eric said . " Yet today only 10 percent of the islanders use them . " On the other hand , Eric also helped build 29 water catchment tanks and improve seven others , providing healthier drinking water and the frequent showers that everybody loves to take . And the islanders are ambitious for their children . Although Truk state supports an elementary school on the island , junior and  |p487  senior high school students once had to go to Ulul for classes . To keep their early teenagers at home , Puluwat built the Puluwat Middle School , a cluster of cottages with thatched roofs , latticed walls , and sand for floors . Puluwat 's own college graduates have returned to staff the school . On our third day at Puluwat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been lost . Since the boat 's radio did n't function while the motor was running and the 26-year-old first-time captain failed to inspire confidence , we decided to stay with the Micro Dawn , despite whatever time it took . After a stop at Pulusuk the Micro Dawn lost an engine as well as its radar and ran low on both food and water . Under the circumstances the captain decided to return directly to Moen to refit and resupply . We sailed into Truk 's capital 11 days after leaving it . I never did get to President Nakayama 's island of Ulul . But a footnote . A report came to me from Moen : " I thought you 'd like to hear what you missed by not taking the Miss Namonuito back to Moen . Once more the crew got lost , and this time wound up in Ulul . Then they set out from Ulul and got lost again . At last radio report the captain was going to give up sailing . When we stopped by Ulul this trip to drop off the high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the Miss Namonuito , resigned to exile . " WHEN WE LEFT TRUK , we flew , of course , on Air Mike , the nickname for Continental/Air Micronesia , the only jet service linking all the new nations of Micronesia . But Air Mike is more than an airline , it is a lifeline . Dividing planes into cargo and passenger sections , it carries everything , including automobiles . The airline 's " island hopper " is a kind of trolley car of the Pacific , with the downhome flavor of the neighborhood streetcar . Stopping at island after island , the 727 picks up presidents and governors , missionaries and teachers , entrepreneurs and lawyers ? all of whom know one another . To travel on Air Mike is like being at a party ? daily evidence of how small the vast Pacific truly is . For Air Mike 's arrivals on Yap , the last of the four states of the Federated States of Micronesia that I would cover , the sense of party heightened . A crowd of Yapese , led by Governor John Mangefel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit with those on-going , who invariably debark for just such talks during the short layover . The air terminal is a metal-roofed shed divided by woven bamboo half walls . Its gift shop is a counter where trays of betel nuts are sold ; a snack 4  |p492  bar stocks Ziploc bags of pepper leaves and lime for enhancing the pleasure of betel-nut chewing . Governor Mangefel , his mouth blood red and bulging with betel nut , wore informal attire : thongs , shorts belted below a bulging tummy , and sport shirt barely closed with a single button . His appearance deceives . The first college graduate from Yap , with a major in English literature from the University of Hawaii , John Mangefel is a writer of wit and learning ; he also has winning charm . Yap is famous for its money , big stone disks first cut and brought from Palau centuries ago and intermittently transported since . I saw hundreds , in all sizes , lining garden paths , adorning home platforms , and congregated in the yards of lofty meetinghouses . Yap has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose histories and owners are known and whose value is calculated by the difficulty of the trip and the cost in human life to bring the disks across the sea from Palau by sailing canoes . Yap is also known for its caste system , possibly the greatest wall still separating it from the modern world . In times past , highcaste villages , with chiefs , nobles , and commoners regarded as " pure , " were expected to take care of the low-caste villages , whose servants and serfs were considered " polluted . " In exchange , the low-caste villages provided goods and services , usually menial . In both castes women were in a class below and apart , not even expected to eat from the same taro patch as men . While this feudal system is eroding , some caste distinctions remain , with gratuitous services still demanded of the lower caste . I heard the story of a high-caste , collegeeducated government official whose mother had an old man of low caste working in her yard , even though blind . " Why , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor old man struggling to serve you ? " " Because it 's God 's will ! " she cried . When I talked to Henry Worswick , principal of the 400-student high school on Yap , I learned that he has seen " tremendous social change " since starting in education 20 years ago . Yet : " I find the situation alarming , " he said , " when people are denied educational and job opportunities , promotions , prestige ? all because of being low caste . " Governor Mangefel is a conservative and wants to preserve what he considers the best of Yap 's cultural heritage : respect for elders , the extended family , and reliance on private initiative rather than government subsidy . On my last night in Yap I went with New Yorker Becky Hynicka , of the Girl Scouts of National Geographic , October 1986 New Nation  |p493  the U.S.A. , to the community center at Colonia , the capital , to witness the investiture of Girl Scout Troop No. 34 . The governor came in his usual dress , with a betel-nut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the moment called upon to assist in pinning his daughter , Geneivie , one of the new Girl Scouts . Just before the ceremony , the girls sang " Paddle , Paddle Your Own Canoe . " It was all something of a wall-jumping experience : that these little girls , growing up female in a society still rooted in feudalism , could each yet aspire to paddle her own canoe . I was touched . THE WESTERNMOST among the emerging nations of the Pacific , the Republic of Palau ( or Belau ) , population more than 15,000 , is divided into 16 separate states , each with its own governor , lieutenant governor , and legislature . Most state populations are very small , and one wonders if anyone has time for anything but government , American style and democratic though it may be . An example is Peleliu , the tragic island where more than 13,000 Americans and Japanese died during less than three months of fighting , often hand to hand , in the autumn of 1944 . Pat and I went to Peleliu from Koror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave-tossing , rear-slapping 45 minutes , and arrived to discover it was the state 's election day , with five candidates running for governor . Although Peleliu claims a population of 2,000 people , only 400 actually live there . More registered voters live in Koror than on their home island , and 800 send votes from Guam . The situation is similar in Palau 's other states . A current joke puts a laugh in the truth . A man walks into a bar in Koror and calls out , " Hey , Governor ! " And half the men in the place stand up . But that 's only the state story . The national government is headed by President Lazarus Salii , followed by a vice president , a cabinet responsible for five ministries , a judiciary , and a legislature with a 16-member house and a 14-member senate . Then there 's the hereditary leadership . Each village has ten chiefs , ranked in importance . And , dividing the island group , there are two paramount chiefs . Never , I thought , have so few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people on government salaries , it is not surprising that at least half the paychecks stem from the government . But I did find two people independently swimming against the tide . Masahuru " Max " Moros of Koror , about 50 years old , gave up a government job in the marine resources department to go it alone as a fisherman and farmer . On his small plot he raises Chinese cabbage , sweet potatoes , cassava , bananas , papayas , coconuts , three varieties of limes , and betel palms , saving the three dollars a day needed to supply his wife with betel nut . For protein and extra cash , he goes fishing or crabbing . " Since I stay home , " he told me , " I make four times as much money as working for the government . The other night I trapped 35 coconut crabs and sold 20 to make $180 . " Palau imports as much as 75 percent of its food today , " he lamented . " But the people could grow or catch everything they need , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that beer is Palau 's second leading import , after fuel oil , and that its dollar value is twice that of all the country 's exports . Harson Shiro , a young man who went to school in Michigan and Texas , returned to his native state of Ngaraard , determined to help young people find meaningful work ? and dignity ? at home . He was building a hotel virtually single-handedly . We went on another tooth-jarring boat ride to see how he was coming along . On a sandy strand shaded by magnificent old trees stood Harson 's first unit , a single room under a thatched roof , decorated with staghorn corals and carved storyboards , equipped with a pool table , and set up to serve drinks and food . Nearby , thatched roofs already covered sites for six guest cottages , and planking lay stacked for walls . " Before cutting a tree for the planking , " Harson told me , " we dance beneath it to pay respect for the life of the tree and the lives of the people who have passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten trees to replace each one cut . Harson 's big push was for money to pour concrete floors in the cottages . " Tourism , " he said , " is the hope of our future . " In Koror , President Salii agreed . He invited us to a picnic 4  |p498  one Sunday , showing us , himself , the incredible beauty of his realm . In white shorts and shirt , devilmay-care at the wheel of his own speedboat , President Salii took us darting among the myriad Rock Islands , onetime coral reefs that through time have been lifted above the sea , carved by wave action , and dressed in tropical foliage ( pages 462-3 ) . " There are a thousand private beaches here , just a quick boat ride from our hotels , " he said with a smile that transformed his face . " And a million wonders in the water . " Snorkeling , I saw live soft coral waving in a rainbow of hues and tropical fish in a fantasy of sizes , shapes , colors , and markings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clams , some four and a half feet in diameter and weighing 200 pounds , believed to be more than 60 years old . We marveled that these beautiful creatures grow so huge , thanks to symbiosis with tiny but abundant one-celled algae . This natural food production encourages several Micronesian islands to farm the clams for human consumption . President Salii may be fun-loving on his day off , but he takes his job seriously . After Palau 's first president , Haruo Remeliik , was assassinated in June 1985 , Salii ran for president , promising to resolve the impasse with the United States that had prevented the negotiation of a compact . The problem ? The Palauans had voted for a constitution that banned nuclear devices . Salii then initialed a compact agreement with the U. S. allowing American ships and planes of all types to operate in Palau . A court ruling held the compact illegal without a 75 percent referendum vote , a constitutional stipulation . Salii dissented , arguing for a more flexible interpretation of the constitution : " It does not say we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If an appeal fails , he could ask his countrymen to give him the 75 percent endorsement at the polls . Difficult ? Maybe . But the agreement won a 72 percent referendum last February . The Palau compact also allows the American military the option of using the nation 's big island of Babelthuap for bases if the U. S. should lose those in the Philippines . At the end I returned to Saipan and sought out Governor Pedro P. Tenorio of the new Northern Marianas commonwealth . We lunched together looking out on the gardens of a luxury hotel filled with Japanese honeymooners , as are most hotels in Saipan . Japanese money had built the hotels with foreign labor , because the labor force on Saipan , as elsewhere throughout Micronesia , is meager and largely untrained . " The Japanese did n't treat us badly before World War II , " said Governor " Pete " Tenorio . " Their policy , I believe , was to keep us native Chamorros out of harm 's way . Before the Americans invaded Saipan in 1944 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our farm in the hills . We kids never knew about the suicides until later . " @# @#  |p499  Believing surrender dishonorable and fearing that victorious Americans would kill , torture , and rape , hundreds of Japanese settlers and soldiers leapt to their death from cliffs now known as Banzai and Suicide . I had stood atop Banzai Cliff , rising sheer from the foaming sea , and , in my mind 's eye , saw the horror . Whole families came to jump , the children lined up by age with the youngest at cliff 's edge . On command , each child pushed off the one in front , until the father pushed the mother and he turned and jumped with his back to the sea , so as not to lose his nerve . And all the while , Americans in small boats offshore broadcast pleas in Japanese for them not to jump and attempted to save those who survived . The governor grew up to go to high school and college on Guam , working his way . He started his business career on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rental agency for jukeboxes and electronic games , then slot machines , and now poker machines , a popular hotel entertainment . But politics is Governor Tenorio 's deepest interest , as I observed firsthand during his run for a second term as governor . The campaign was a corker , with public debates turned wild with accusations , massive rallies fueled by free beer and food , newspaper crusades , and illustrated posters nailed to every tree and post . The political tempest was brewed in the teapot of a mere 7,000 voters , 90 percent on Saipan , virtually all the rest on the islands of Rota and Tinian . AS AMERICAN as the election was , however , Janet McCoy , the High Commissioner of the Trust Territory of the Pacific , sees the islanders as little changed by the U. S. presence in fundamental values and sense of identity . " Of course , I 've seen the improvements brought by our country , " she told me , listing airplane runways and COMSAT stations in each capital , maternal and child healthcare programs , Head Start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I see most is a group of people who , down the centuries , through occupation by four totally different governments ? Spanish , German , Japanese , and American ? have managed to retain their own culture . They have remained true to their own beliefs and ways of life , have never truly been assimilated , and are now , at last , free to govern themselves , to make their own decisions , to handle their own affairs . " The best thing we may have done is to help educate and train exceptional island leaders , " she said . " In the four and a half years I have been here , I 've seen them grow and mature , at home and at the UN . " Lazarus Salii too had spoken of these leaders . They had all once served together in the territory-wide Congress of Micronesia ? FSM President Nakayama and Bethwel Henry , Speaker of the FSM Congress ; Governor Resio S. Moses of Pohnpei , Governor Mangefel of Yap , Governor Tenorio of the Northern Marianas , President Kabua of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Micronesia had limited power , subject to veto by the U. S. high commissioner but with an advise-and-consent voice in appointments . It was their training ground ? and they had all been together . " There was a time when many of us hoped , " said Salii , " that we could have a United States of Micronesia ? one nation . But it was not to be .... " I remember my last meeting in the Federated States with Tosiwo Nakayama , Bethwel Henry , and Resio Moses . I had invited them and their wives to lunch at The Village on Pohnpei , and we were served delicious fresh crab and breadfruit salad in the big , breeze-swept dining room . As we lingered over glasses of white wine , a tropical storm blew up , and in the fury of wind and rain we seemed to draw closer to one another . Once I had mentioned to President Nakayama that I had heard the American administration of the trust territory described as the " scandal of the Pacific . " And he had been quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the United States . You gave us our freedom , the right to speak our minds . And education . " Now he spoke again of the United States and the difficulty of having a brother so big , so powerful , so flaunting with nuclear power . But it was of a family that he spoke ; people in the islands understand about families . As for me , I felt I had been witness at a birth in that family . The birth of nations that are forever bound by memory of the days they were one , in trust .
