COVER STORY <P> Despite choppy waters , the President holds steady on Reaganomics <P> " Can anyone here say that if we ca n't do it , someone down the road can do it ? And if no one does it , what happens to the country ? All of us here know the economy would face an eventual collapse . I know it 's a hell of a challenge , but ask yourselves : If not us , who ? If not now , when ? " <P> With those stern words last week , Ronald Reagan ordered his Cabinet to find new ways of cutting as much as $15 billion out of next year 's budget and a stunning $74 billion in 1983 and 1984 . And with those demands , the President opened Chapter 2 in the history of Reaganomics , the Administration 's bold plan to alter fundamentally the policy directions of the past half-century and to put the U.S. back on a course of steady , noninflationary growth after years of stagnation and inflation . <P> When Reagan left Washington in August for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just wrapped up Chapter 1 and had every reason to feel satisfied , even a bit smug . No President since Franklin D. Roosevelt had done so much so quickly to change the basic path of the American economy . Though critics had confidently predicted that Congress would never go along with his daring " supply-side " strategy of large budget cuts and deep tax reductions , Reagan had pushed his programs through the House and Senate virtually intact . <P> But back in the White House last week , the President had to face the sobering reality that his job of overhauling the U.S. economy has barely begun . Even before the program 's first tax cut was to go into effect , on Oct. 1 , doubts about Reaganomics were proliferating , notably on Wall Street and among Congressmen , aided and abetted by some economists and editorial pundits . <P> Despite the disquiet-even near panic in some sectors-the economy overall is doing surprisingly well in a number of ways . Near record interest rates have hampered growth , but most experts do not foresee anything like a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period of sluggishness , industrial production is expected to rebound sharply . TIME 's Board of Economists , * which met last week in New York City , predicted that by the second half of 1982 business would be growing at a robust 4% annual pace . Alice Rivlin , the director of the Congressional Budget Office and a guest participant at the meeting , reported that her office is assuming a 4% annual economic expansion in the years 1983 and 1984 . Said she : " We are quite optimistic about the outlook for the economy . " <P> What matters most to most Americans , as polls have shown in recent years , is inflation-and inflation is coming down . TIME 'S economists noted that price increases have slowed from 17.3% in the first quarter of 1980 to 10.8% during the past three months . It is not so far Reagan policy as much as his good luck that is responsible , but the economists now expect that inflation will fall even further next year , to 7.5% , and that will in good measure be to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Federal Reserve Board . <P> Why , then , the sudden outburst of postsummer anxiety , even before Reaganomics has a chance to show what it can do ? Nearsightedness in a word . And a fear that , in the long run , Reagan can not deliver what he has promised . Or , put another
