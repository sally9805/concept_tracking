I RETURNED to Gloucester last year just as New England was enjoying that delicious moment when its summer heat expires into the annual balm of fall . The sumacs ' fingers were already tipped with red , and the grackles seethed each evening around the firs on Rust Island as they mustered before moving South . Down in the harbor the pleasure craft were still tacking and whizzing about among the fishing boats , but the summer people had begun to muffle themselves against winds that were cutting in from Massachusetts Bay and the Gulf of Maine . It was their last fling before the launches were hauled high and dry , to be towed away inland for the winter or left snug beneath tarpaulin in the marinas like rows of stranded whales . Soon the roar of outboards would give way to the lamasery note of halyards tinkling against bare steel masts , and the draggers and scallopers working out of Gloucester would have the harbor and the sea beyond the breakwater all to themselves . The town itself seemed to be more or less as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve 2 , , months of its untidy , g warm , exuberant , and ; frequently boisterous in ways . Main Street had been widened a bit at one point to accommodate more easily the endless procession of trucks that roll up empty from most of the United States and return whence they came , loaded to the roof with fish sticks and other produce of the sea . A wasteland at the top of the harbor had been cleaned up and fenced in , its adjacent road now smoothed with tarmac where it had been deeply rutted and potholed before , as if from an assault by tanks . Otherwise nothing had changed . The Yankee General Store on East Main still overflowed with implements old and new , with bygones and bric-a-brac stretching back a century at least . The hostelry where Rudyard Kipling stayed for three weeks while he made notes for Captains Courageous remained blessedly old-fashioned , untouched by the passage of time or the invention of Holiday Inns . The clapboard homes rose in terraces and dabs of white and olive , blue and brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns I recalled . Returning to Gloucester was like putting on a pair of old slippers that time has molded easily around the feet . HE COMFORTABLE familiarity was deceptive , for Gloucester is in as great a turmoil as it has known in its three hundred and fifty years . It has worries that have always come from its relationship with the sea , and its fishermen have been nagging as usual about the inequity of the marketplace that decreed , in the first six months of 1980 , that although landings increased by 52 percent , their value rose by less than half as much . Beyond that there is an ominous cloud hanging offshore over Georges Bank , possibly the richest fishing ground left on earth , where Mobil , Exxon , and other oil companies will start drilling and inevitably polluting if the Departments of the Interior and Commerce ( under the baton of the White House ) have their way against the protests of the fishermen , the environmentalists , and the attorney general of Massachusetts . Neither of these issues , however , ranked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By a fair margin , that was provided by the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity , a mouthful more conveniently uttered as the Unification Church . In short . the Moonies have moved in , and the result can be seen as a storm in a local teacup , or as the case of a small community that feels threatened by something much ' bigger and possibly better organized that it is itself . There are about twenty-eight thousand people in Gloucester . and some of them reckon that the handful of Moonies already in their midst are merely the scouts for an invading army that has spread from Asia and now claims three million adherents in 120 countries . The Moonies first came to town in 1977 . Their American holdings already extended from Alaska , down and around through California , Alabama , Virginia , and , most substantially , New York . And twelve months earlier a boat had been discovered at Swampscott , on Boston 's North Shore , offloading tuna into a truck labeled Tong Il Enterprises , which drove its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a plane for Japan . In the summer of 1977 , the Moonies had rented a house on the southern outskirts of Gloucester . and four or five boats began to fish as the tuna season began . Occasionally their numbers were augmented by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon himself . founder and all but godhead of the movement , who turned up like a holiday maker in his 48-foot yacht . And so sensitive were these newcomers to public opinion that in December of that year they called an open meeting to " share our hearts with you about the activities of the Rev. Moon and the Unification Church in Gloucester . " This communion seems to have been a bit short on theology but high on deodorized mysticism if a quotation from Aidan Barry , head of the church'An Massachusetts , is anything to judge by . " For ecologically minded people who are not just thinking of preserving wild life but of preserving civilized life , " he told his small audience , " the ocean is very important . The Reverend Moon grew up by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea . For me , too , the ocean is a very spiritual place . You can go out there in the middle of winter and sit on the rocks and you can go to many places in your mind . " This may not have tallied with the maritime reflexes of most Gloucestermen , but the locals let it pass and the meeting ended without incident . The first of these was to come a few weeks later , when a deputation of Moonies met the mayor of Gloucester , Leo Alper , to discuss their future plans in the district , which might very well require certain civic indulgences . American history is littered with ringing phrases that have called good republicans to the flag , and Mayor Alper now came out with another one that is sure of immortality in at least the local anthologies . " You 'll have strap marks on your ass , " he informed the Moonies , " before you 'll get a permit out of me for any sort of harbor development . " Nothing has been quite the same since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Moonie spokesman promised to notify City Hall of any impending purchases the church might make in the town , but no warning had been given when , in April 1978 , it was announced that three acres of land had been bought at Freshwater Cove . At once the mayor closed the cove as a public mooring and threatened to condemn the only road leading into it , thus causing confusion for several well-established residents whose boats had long been sheltered there . Unperturbed , the Moonies went onto another tack , and three months later , again without advance notice , bought the ailing Gloucester Lobster Company for $300,000 , which was about twice the price any local businessman would have paid for it , although a consortium hastily organized by the mayor had been ready to bid as high as a quarter of a million dollars . At a stroke , the Moonies had acquired a waterfront base in the upper and busiest part of Gloucester Harbor to counterbalance their handsome landholding at the seaward end opposite the breakwater . More important , they had secured the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobster fishermen . They renamed it International Seafood Company , adding this to the exhausting list of titles under which the Unification Church conducts its affairs in the United States ( the Congressional Record in 1976 enumerated 59 , but an exMoonie more recently purports to have blown the gaffe on 141 ) . After that there were two years of consolidation on one side and aggrieved suspicion on the other , with the vast majority of citizens doing little but watching and waiting in their no man 's land between Freshwater Cove and City Hall . The dragger Sea Rich arrived at the International Seafood wharf , to reinforce the Moonie flotilla of small tuna-fishing craft but , unlike them , was never seen doing much work . Businessmen who had long monopolized the commerce of the waterfront kept an eye on all this and noted the Moonies had taken about 15 percent of the bluefin catch brought into Gloucester in the 1978 season . It was understood that most of it was destined for the Far East , where tuna is in much greater demand , at far higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being another matter , the local shell fishermen cautiously began to trade again with the premises on which they had always landed their hauls , and were pleasantly surprised when the new owners offered higher prices than they had known before , comparable to those that had long been standard over at Rockport , on the other side of Cape Ann . Most people who had dealings with the Moonies , indeed , found them a thoroughly civilized bunch of young people , distinguished by their courtesy and gentle speech . Nevertheless , from Beacon Hill , Sen. John King was to be heard calling for a full investigation of religious fund-raising and business activities in the Bay State ( at which Aidan Barry observed that " we 're aware of the history of religious persecution in Massachusetts " I. And in City Hall , Mayor Alper began to compose a map of his bailiwick , with Moonie encroachments blocked out in red , and the taxable value of each such encroachment marked on every block . I F ALL this may be regarded as a period of truce , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer . The first and most dramatic concerned the Cardinal Cushing Villa on the land behind Freshwater Cove , just down the old Boston stagecoach road from Gloucester 's most famous monument ? Leonard Craske 's bronze figure of the Man at the Wheel , who stands , seabooted and sou'westered. by his helm onthe harbor wall , forever looking out at the Atlantic horizon . The villa , an impressive example of New England Tudor ( built in 1845 ) , was once owned by John Hays Hammond , Sr. , mining engineer , friend of Cecil Rhodes , and father of the man who invented the organ that bears his name and who , on the eve of World War I , electrified Gloucester by sending an empty launch careering round the harbor under remote control . The villa was presented to the Archdiocese of Boston and for several years was used by His Eminence the Cardinal for rest and relaxation . It was later taken over by the Daughters of Mary of the Immaculate Conception , a teaching order of nuns with headquarters in Connecticut , and maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last June somebody got wind of a rumor that the villa was corning up for sale , and emissaries from City Hall were told by the nuns that , although this was true , they certainly were n't bargaining with the Unification Church . Their anonymous buyer turned out to be a businessman from Salem , New Hampshire , who duly purchased the property for one million dollars , and then , within twenty-four hours , resold it at a profit of $127,600 to the Moonies . Aidan Barry had scarcely finished justifying this remarkable piece of brokering ( there had been no alternative to subterfuge , he claimed , because the mayor 's prejudices would have blocked a straightforward sale ) than Mayor Alper was cabling the Pope an assurance that " any effort you can exert to reverse the sale will be deeply appreciated by citizens of all faiths within my city and along the North Shore . " Presently , and by airmail , the Vatican replied that it was helpless in the matter , regretted " this unfortunate occurrence , " and hoped that as little harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time , Gloucester as a whole began to regard the Moonies as a phenomenon that might be set for a bigger influence on the town 's future than had been generally supposed . Before the month was out , the worst fears of those most hostile to the arrivistes were confirmed when a bankrupt waterfront restaurant , Bob 's Clam Shack , was put up for auction . Four days before the sale , a spokesman for International Seafood said publicly that he doubted whether anyone representing the Unification Church in Gloucester would even attend . With a bland manipulation of words that anybody 's attorney might admire , he was absolutely right . The three young fellows in two-ply suits who outbid all rivals by a clear $25,000 to secure the property for $650.000 , did so on behalf of Uni-World Sea- foods Enterprises Inc. , of New York City ? an affiliation that increases the number of Moonie aliases to at least 142 . The new property lay right alongside the premises of International Seafood and gave the Unification Church in Gloucester a useful extension to its piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was announced that the old Clam Shack would henceforth trade under the name of the New One Restaurant . A T THIS point genuine fury was let loose round the town , and things took a turn for the worse . An effigy of the Reverend Moon was hanged from a pole on Pavilion Beach , and stones were thrown at the windows of the New One , where self-appointed pickets have gathered every weekend since it opened . to deter potential customers . A young Japanese trainee at a Gloucester engineering factory was accosted and frightened outside the restaurant one night , because the pickets assumed that anyone who looked like him must be a Moonie , which he was n't . The moment the Moonies moved into the Cardinal Cushing Villa , local yobboes began to intimidate the new neighbors by driving past at all hours of the day and night , honking car horns , firing guns into the air , and hurling obscenities over the high stone wall . The epithet " Commies " was , of course , bandied about as well , which , given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening in a saga that has not been without its share of farce . In July the city council officially urged all citizens to boycott any property deals the Unification Church might try to make and within days had to eat its words on the advice of the city solicitor , who had just taken a look at the United States Constitution and suspected they might be violating the First and Fourteenth Amendments . Meanwhile , T-shirts began to appear on the streets , emblazoned with SAVE THE HUMAN RACE PUNCH A MOON IN THE FACE . Bumper stickers were rushed off the presses , too . By the time I returned to Gloucester in September , I frequently found myself driving behind vehicles with two exhortations plastered along the back fender . The offside was apt to read REAGAN ; the nearside said DO N'T LET THE MOON RISE OVER GLOUCESTER . The immediate response of the Moonies to this increased hostility was a push for better public relations . Within weeks after acquiring the villa , they invited all corners to attend a Sunday morning service there , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and television men , joined twenty or so Moonies in singing ' Joyful , Joyful " and other choruses demonstrably inappropriate to the prevailing sentiments of the hour . A much larger and more varied section of the community turned out for a lecture in a Gloucester school on the principles of the Unification Church , but that event ended in uproar , with four Moonies needing police protection out of the building . The head of the church in America , Mose Durst , descended on City Hall , where he and Mayor Alper discovered that they had more in common than either could have dreamt of ; both Jewish , and each the son of men who had emigrated from the same town in Russia at approximately the same time . Durst had scarcely departed for New York when the largest gesture of all was announced . The seafood companies attached to the church were going to sponsor one of the richest fishing competitions in history , offering $100,000 to prizewinners catching the heaviest , the longest , and the highest aggregate of tuna in Massachusetts waters during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fish caught must be sold to the Moonie companies . It has to be said that the majority of local tuna fishermen promptly put their prejudices or their principles where their financial instincts normally are and failed to rise to this bait . Relatively few participated in the tournament , and it became statistically probable from the outset that Moonie fishermen would clean up most of the prize money , as they did , taking $97.000 of the whole . The most successful of them declared at the weigh-in that he would be donating the whole of his $70.000 to local charities ; but when I inquired a month later which charities these might be , I was told rather vaguely that the church was still trying to figure that out . " . . . Mr. Moon 's mind business " T HE MAYOR , for one , was not surprised when I imparted this item of non-news . " I 'm telling you , " he said , " this is just an active money-making organization as far as I 'm concerned ? and anyway , which charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were offered ? " He spoke with the air of someone who was perhaps born slightly cynical and has improved on it by trying . But even political opponents of this bulky man ( imagine , if you can , an even fleshier version of the late Zero Mostel ) concede his unswerving devotion to what he deems the best interests of Gloucester since he arrived at City Hall in 1976 . He denies that his objection to the Moonies is rooted in an almost personal experience some years ago , when the son of a close acquaintance was induced to join a similar cult and somehow contrived to dispose of half the family fortune in its favor . He says he is hostile partly because he does n't much like the idea of brainwashing , but mostly because he does n't see why local businesses should be unfairly threatened by an organization that enjoys apparently infinite financial backing and that obtains all its own labor free of charge . The first reason caused Mayor Alper to alert the local Cub Scouts when he heard the Moonies might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from both heart and pocket of a man whose own substance is based on a Main Street laundry and a certain amount of Gloucester real estate . Add to that his leverage at City Hall , and the Moonies could not have a more difficult opponent . He is awaiting with some relish the moment next September when the Moonies will be obliged to apply for charitable tax exemption on the Cushing Villa , if ever they 're going to try ? and he does n't doubt they will . " I tell you , " he says , " I do n't intend to let ' em get away with a goddamn thing . And if they start unlicensed begging on the streets , I 'll knock ' em off for that , too . " If most of the respectable fire and brimstone in Gloucester issues from City Hall ( and it does ) , there are also several worthy stokers at work lower down the municipal scale , quite apart from those businessmen who had come to regard Gloucester Harbor as a profitable private estate over the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can to keep things that way . The local publisher of the Gloucester Daily Times ( which is owned by a subsidiary of Dow Jones ) has refused to accept advertisements from any organization connected with the Unification Church , although the paper 's reporting of the entire story has been scrupulously fair . Two protest groups have arisen in the past few months , both marching in close order behind Mayor Alper and both , most strikingly , officered by women ? nearly all young mothers with children at school . One of these groups , the Concerned Citizens of Gloucester , arranges the weekend picketing of the New One Restaurant and any other active demonstration that circumstances might suggest . They have regrouped as the Citizens Against Unethical Subjugation and Exploitation . CAUSE is an offshoot of the Coalition for a Free Gloucester , which was formed as a propaganda unit ( or , as its leaders would say , to educate ) against any local influence the Unification Church could have . Among other things , the Coalition has disseminated a lot of those stickers seen around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1978 on Korean-American Relations to broadsheets written by ex-Moonies and the bimonthly journal of the American Family Foundation . It has organized a petition with five thousand signatures supporting the mayor 's stand . And it has produced its own list of Do 's and Don'ts for uncertain citizens , under the heading " Our Response to the Moonies . " Examples : " DO invite them to your churches . Express your hope and confidence in our society . DO N'T go on a weekend retreat with them , no matter how spiritually strong you might think you are . " When I speak to one of the indefatigable women at the head of the Coalition , I discover a lurking fear that appears to lie behind most of the hostility offered the Unification Church in whatever country this has been expressed . She says that " we do n't want them to take over our businesses to make money for Mr. Moon 's mind business " and extended this into a nervous condemnation of mind control ? ' as used in the Korean War and by the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents were in much danger of losing their offspring to the sect , though this is the stigma that has been most widely attached to the church ( as I write , the High Court in London is rumbling through a libel action brought by the leading British Moonie against a newspaper that published a story headlined THE CHLRCH THAT BREAKS UP FAMILIES ) . The Coalition is evidently cool on this topic not because Aidan Barry has publicly promised that there will be no recruiting in Gloucester , but because it does n't think the Moonies would be so dumb as to make such a move . One member remarked , " There are people in this town who 'd tear that villa apart if they did ; and the Moonies know it . " T HE CAUSES and objects of these antagonisms are , as even their critics admit , remarkably civil in the flesh , though they have been known to lose their poise under stress . Somewhere along the line ( possibly when the Pope was being telegraphed , or when smoke signals were sent to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mayor was a clown who might be possessed by the Devil . Anathema was not in the air , however . when I visited the Cushing Villa one Sunday morning after only a short negotiation by telephone for permission to see things there for myself . I had hoped to talk to Aidan Barry in these surroundings , but he told me that would be impossible , as he had to conduct a seminar that weekend and then would be away in New York during the rest of my time in Gloucester . The seminar , in fact , was in full swing when I arrived , involving resident Moonies and " a few guests from Boston . " It was taking place behind heavily padlocked iron gates , which was understandable enough in view of the recent harassment . Just inside were a number of pickups bearing registration plates from three or four states , and several rows , regimentally neat , of tubs with tuna fishing lines coiled in each . A large circular garden plot had been stripped of vegetation and would , it was explained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern of the Moonie symbol , which is a globe with its meridians and parallels distorted to form a cross . I was led into a small room off the kitchen to await Aidan Barry 's henchwoman , who turned out to be a wide-eyed Californian with a steadfast smile , engaged to marry another Moonie , who is a carpenter by trade . After checking with Barry , she said we might move upstairs , where it was more comfortable , so long as I did n't mind leaving my shoes behind ; and , indeed , everyone treads the upper floors of the villa in stockinged feet , like good Muslims in a mosque . A number of these faithful , I noticed , also walk demurely with , downcast eyes and hands folded in front , as the novices would have done when the place was occupied by nuns . There were , perhaps , three dozen people in the building while I was there ( I was told that twenty Moonies now live in Gloucester , with a permanently floating population of maybe half as many again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two were over thirty years old . All but my smiling lady crept into the old chapel shortly after I arrived , and the oak-paneled walls of the long mock-Tudor gallery where we sat bounced thereafter to the echo of a sing-along-and-clap , which was being conducted most vigorously from the other side of the door . A great deal of comfortable chintzy furniture was deployed about that room , together with vases and other knickknacks , but I do n't believe there is one piece of orthodox Christian symbolism in the Cardinal Cushing Villa these days ? not a crucifix , not a text , not a " Light of the World " ? a curious omission I have also observed in places where the Mormons meet . I ca n't pretend that our conversation was particularly illuminating , occurring as it did between two people whose terms of reference were far apart and whose understanding ofwords did not always coincide . She spoke to me of her own conversion to the church in muffled phrases similar to those I have heard from monks and nuns who believe they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " having received a sign " or " hearing a call from God " ? which is not much help when you yourself have some difficulty in defining God . I made a note of what she said about the Reverend Moon , in response to my question whether she thought he was the Messiah , and it came out verbatim like this : " He 's one of the most humble men I 've met . He 's the kind of person who , when he prays , gives everything he 's got . He never asks anyone to do anything he wo n't or has n't done himself . He 's never too grand . He 's a very creative person " ; then she drifted elaborately away onto another subject . I was rather astonished when she said she did n't feel at all persecuted in Gloucester . " These people , " she said , " love us . They really do . " Then she took me outside to inspect the dilapidated folly that John Hays Hammond , Sr. , built to give himself a splendid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its turrets , admiring the lovely day , when in an expansive moment she pointed to Ten Pound Island , where early Gloucestermen used to impound their sheep , and where Winslow Homer spent a whole summer with his easel and watercolors , painting like mad . " We think , " said my Moonie , " that would make a marvelous marina one day . " A T INTERNATIONAL Seafood the atmosphere was similarly benign in the portable office where someone has propped above his desk an opened wallet of photographs of the Reverend Moon and his family , just as a dutiful son would . The adjacent shed where the lobsters are graded , bought , and sold is a model of order and hygiene , and the two Moonie draggers berthed at the wharf looked as though any fisherman would be happy to take them to sea . In fact , I was told , the Sea Rich is a monstrously ill-designed boat , which rolls like a barrel even in five-foot waves ; and the Sun Rise , which the Moonies built themselves , is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decks and plating are necessary to withstand violent seas . My informant said he had made certain recommendations to the hierarchy of the church and , if these were accepted , those two boats would be returning south before winter set in and would not be seen again in Gloucester until spring . He implied that to do otherwise would be endangering crews whose experience of deep-sea fishing is limited and mostly confined to the more tranquil conditions found in the Gulf of Mexico . Some of those Moonie fishermen may have been taking lunch later that day at the New One Restaurant next door , because when I inquired about the chances of a meal I was politely told it was closed to outsiders " because we 're giving a banquet for members of our church . " Later in the week , however , 1 enjoyed ( in solitary state ) a splendid brunch in surroundings that had changed a bit since the days of the old Clam Shack . Gone were the busty miniskirted girls who used to serve drinks , and Bob 's arrangement of nooks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twosomes to sit and linger had been replaced by a wide-open space that resembled a superior works ' canteen . The building had also acquired a broken window , which my waiter shrugged off as the product of hooliganism weeks before . " Things have quieted down a lot , " he said . " And , anyway , we now have a couple of Brothers on guard outside on weekends , just to keep an eye on things . " Money-spinning habits I T SEEMED a miserable precaution to have to take in such an inoffensive place . And yet it is not hard to see why a large proportion of Gloucester 's people are so inflamed against the new organism that has taken root in their town . My own experience of ? what shall I call it ? ? the oblique and mercenary ways of the Moonies is trivial but suggests a certain element in the Unification Church that did n't originate in the Sermon on the Mount . At the Cushing Villa I had asked for a copy of The Divine Principle , which has roughly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mormon holds among the Latter-Day Saints ; and which no less a person than a professor of Religious Studies at the University of Toronto has described as " the most interesting theological treatise I 've read in twenty years . It may even he the most important theological treatise of the twentieth century . " At the villa I was told that I could n't have a copy right there and then , because they were all kept in a locked room , but that arrangements would be made for me to pick one up from International Seafood a few days later . At the end of my stay in Gloucester , and on my second visit to that portable office , the man entrusted with this delivery reached for a volume above his desk and said , " Sure , I 've got it for you ? it cost me ten dollars to get it , though . " So I took the hint and tipped him ten bucks ? and he may care to know that he 's the first religious official I 've known , in a fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tract that I was likely to write about in publicizing his religion . When I got home , however . I found that I had n't been given The Divine Principle at all . That , I understand , runs to more than five hundred pages of pure text . I had been seen off with a publication called Outline of the Principle , Level 4 , with 214 pages , most of which are extensively decorated with the sort of multicolored diagrams thought necessary for the encouragement of backward ten-year-olds . The most intriguing of these seems to postulate a third world war between the forces of Cain ( depicted by a hammer and sickle ) and Abel ( represented by the Statue of Liberty ) . A trivial complaint , as I say , but when magnified to the level of property worth $2.5 million and placed in the context of these past three years in Gloucester , one can see how deep unease has resulted in certain quarters . Oddly enough , with one exception , these do not include the other churches in town , which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his sect , none more than the Catholics , who are probably the most numerous denomination there . The exception is the Rev. Wayne Morgan of the Pigeon Cove Chapel ( theology indeterminate , liturgy spirited ) , who has written aggressive letters to the press and led a protest day of fasting in Stage Fort Park in the fall , and who , it is said , coveted the Cardinal Cushing Villa for ambitious plans of his own . When / canvassed local secular opinion about the Moonies , I heard everything from downright abuse to absolute tolerance , not all of it , on either extreme , very well informed . Of those who have actually had many dealings with the Unification Church , by far the most balanced person told me that " they 're terribly nice people when you meet them ; they just happen to be barefaced liars . " Well , their record has been patently less than straightforward so far . At the same time , the Moonies are regarded with a strangely acute form of tunnel vision by those most hostile to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , have a perfectly respectable pedigree now , extending all the way from the Vatican to the ineffable Billy Graham . And deviousness has been an article of faith in big business ever since John D. Rockefeller manipulated the railroad-freight rates to build up Standard Oil and make himself the world 's first billionaire.
