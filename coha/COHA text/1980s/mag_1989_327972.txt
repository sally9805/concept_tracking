Forget for a moment that Jerome Robbins is one of the pivotal figures in Broadway history and that the gala onstage is a summing up of his invaluable career . For audiences who know what came after , how entertaining is this journey to the bottom of Robbins ' trunk ? If Broadway is not making ' em the way it used to , should we be regretful ? Or relieved ? If neither revivals from Broadway 's heyday nor imitations of that style lead to commercial success , then does this logical next step , a greatest-hits compendium , offer much hope ? <P> The answers , as might be expected with such a patchwork show , depend on what is onstage at the moment . The pratfall pandemonium of the opening scene of A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum makes one long for a full-scale Broadway revival . The dance suite of teen gang wars adapted from West Side Story actually benefits by being divorced from the original 's cute , coy lyrics , which in life would not tumble trippingly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city life may never have been more vibrantly shown than among the World War II-era sailors aprowl in On the Town . The comic chase among cops , con men , thugs and bathing beauties from High Button Shoes improves upon the fizzy Mack Sennett one-reelers that inspired it . <P> On the other hand , the whimsical Siamese retelling of Uncle Tom 's Cabin from The King and I seems stately and slow . The Russian peasant life in Fiddler on the Roof looks even cornier and campier when deprived of the original 's glints of fear and oppression . A protracted , wordless street scene among customers of a speakeasy is unlikely to bring back Billion Dollar Baby . And a danced duet from High Button Shoes , cast with vigorous young performers , defeats the whole sentimental purpose of the original number : to demonstrate that a married couple well along into middle age can not only remain lovebirds but still get their knees up into the air . The show 's archival curiosity is Mr. Monotony , a dance interpreting an Irving Berlin song ; the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here it is amusing , but its fate is understandable : this pure divertissement would be distracting in any musical with a plot . <P> Despite all the ballyhoo about the $8 million price tag , the work onstage can appear modest , even a little tatty . The sets are mostly painted drapes , an awkward compromise between old-style realism and contemporary abstraction . There may be hundreds of costumes , but a lot of them look flimsy ; they might have been basted together by the second-rate strippers in the You Got ta Have a Gimmick number from Gypsy . While the performers dance as brilliantly as one would expect from disciples of Robbins , most ca n't act very well , and there is not one striking singer in the entire company . The most problematic is Robert + La Fosse , a New York City Ballet star who moves gloriously but whose facial expression seems limited to a scowl and a simpering grin . Jason Alexander , who serves as narrator and plays seven characters , has wit , charm and the requisite razzmatazz  --  his parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but lacks the star attribute of effortless ease . Yet if Robbins has not unearthed the treasure trove that many hoped for , he still offers a richly illuminated manuscript from the book of Broadway 's beloved past .
