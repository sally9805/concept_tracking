Ah , the lush , pastoral tidiness of rural Connecticut . Ah , the tranquillity and the clean air-not to mention the attraction of living in a state with no income tax-that have made happy , settled residents of such literary luminaries as Playwright Arthur Miller , 61 ; Journalist Theodore H. White , 66 , and his wife , Historian Beatrice K. Hofstadter ; Novelist and Poet Robert Penn Warren , 76 , and his wife , Writer Eleanor Clark ; Author William Styron , 56 ; Humorist Peter De Vries , 62 ; Writer Harrison Salisbury , 73 ; and Novelist Philip Roth , 49 . Agghhh , the newly passed unincorporated business tax , a temporary , two-year , 5% levy on unincorporated businesses in Connecticut that gross more than $50,000 a year and net $15,000 . The tax hits writers directly , as well as other self-employed people like grocers , doctors and dentists . Rattling quills in preparation for battle , the Connecticut round table of writers will lobby the state assembly for exemption . " We are not businesses , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We just have our typewriters . " And a new cause . <P> <P> It may not be the kind of off-season passing practice that San Francisco 49er Coach Bill Walsh had in mind for the man who quarterbacked his unheralded team to victory in January 's Super Bowl .

Ford during Hirohito 's state visit to the U.S. in 1975 . But Japan 's most famous young bird seemed unimpressed with her imperial visitor . Hoping to change the fowl 's nonchalance , Hirohito studied the crane avidly , then moved in to try his hand at feeding . Still no recognition , but the Emperor was not about to create a flap . For the 80-year-old Hirohito , the bird 's mere existence may carry more import than her aloof manners . In Japanese culture , the crane is a symbol of longevity . <P>
