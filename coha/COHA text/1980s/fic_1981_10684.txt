MOSCOW 12 41 " It is Chekhov , " she said , " and it stinks . You 're not missing a thing . " Levin was studying a chessboard when Arkady entered the pathologist 's office . " I will give you a concise history of our Revolution . " Levin did n't look up from the black and white pieces . " Once a man indulges himself in murder , in time he thinks nothing of robbing , and from robbing he comes next to foul language and atheism , and from these to opening doors without knocking . Black 's move . " " Do you mind ? " Arkady asked . " Go ahead . " Arkady swept the center of the board clean and placed three black pawns there on their sides . " Beauty and Beast and Red . " " What are you doing ? " Levin viewed the havoc of his game . " I think you missed something . " " How would you know ? " " Just let me go through this . Three victims , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two shot through the head as well , so how do you know which shots came first ? " " The killer has planned carefully , " Arkady plunged on . " He re- moves identification papers , cleans the pockets of his victims , actually flays their faces and cuts off the ends of their fingers to eliminate points of identification . However , he takes the added chance of firing two more bullets into the faces of the male victims . " " To make sure they 're dead . " " He knows they 're dead . No , on one man there is another point of identification to erase . " " Maybe he shot them in the head first , then the heart . " " Then why not the girl as well ? No , he shoots one dead man in the face , then realizes he is only announcing what he 's up to , and so shoots the second dead man as well . " " Then I ask you "  --  Levin stood  --  " why not the girl as well ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you as an expert , which you are not , that a bullet of that caliber wo n't create so much disfigurement that the men could n't be identified . Besides , this butcher had already taken their faces off . " " Tell me as an expert , what did the bullets achieve ? " " If the two men were already dead "  --  Levin folded his arms  --  " local destruction mainly . The teeth , which we 've already gone over . " Arkady said nothing . Levin jerked open a drawer and brought out boxes marked GPI and G . From box GPI , he poured two nearly whole incisors into his hand . " Good teeth , " Levin said . " You could crack nuts with these . " The teeth in box G had n't fared as well . One shattered incisor and a separate packet of shards and powder . " Most of one tooth was lost in the snow . However , what we analyzedshows enamel , dentin , cementum , dehydrated pulp , tobacco stain and lead traces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nine grams . ' " Levin used slang for a bullet . " Satisfied ? " " This was Red , the boy who dyed his hair , was n't it ? " " G , for God 's sake ! " Red was downstairs in a cool metal drawer . They wheeled the body into the autopsy room , Arkady puffing on a cigarette . " Give me some light . " Levin elbowed him back . " I thought you hated this work . " The center of the upper jaw was a hole framed by brown secondaryincisors . With a pick , Levin prodded bits of the jaw onto a damp glass slide . When deposits covered the slide , he marched to a microscopeon a worktable . " Do you ever know what you 're looking for , or do you simply guess ? " he asked Arkady . " I guess , but nobody robs an empty safe . " " Whatever that means . " The pathologist applied an eye to the microscope while he stirred the broken bone . Starting with an eyepieceof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a chair and sat with his back to the corpse while Levin removed from the slide one granule of bone at a time . " I sent a report to your office that you probably have n't seen , " Levin said . " The fingertips were clipped off with shears . There is distinctand opposite grooving of the wounds . The facial tissue was not removed with a scalpel , the cuts are n't that fine  --  in fact , there 's a heavy scoring of the bone . I 'd say a big knife , maybe a hunting knife , and extraordinarily sharp . " A fine dust remained on the slide . " Here , take a look . " Magnified two hundred times , the dust was an ivory rubble intersperseclwith pink timber . " What is it ? " 42 MOSCOW KA 43 " Gutta-percha . The tooth broke up the way it did because it was dead and brittle . He had root-canal work , and the gutta-percha was inserted in place of the root . " " I did n't know that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dentists in Europe do n't use gutta-percha , only the Americans . " Levin sneered at Arkady 's grin . " Luck is nothing to be proud of . " " I 'm not proud . " Back at Novokuznetskaya , still in his overcoat , Arkady typed : Report on Gorky Park Homicides . Pathological analysis of Victim G ascertains remnants of a gutta-percha pin in the upper middle right incisor root canal . The pathologist states this is a technique not characteristic of Soviet or European dentistry . It is usual in the U.S.A.G is also the victim who disguised himself by dyeing his red hair to brown . He added his signature and the time , rolled the report out , separatedhis carbon and carried the original next door as tenderly as a commutation of sentence . Iamskoy was out . Arkady laid the report in the middle of the prosecutor 's desk . When Pasha returned in the afternoon , the investigator was in his shirt sleeves leafing through a magazine . The detective set down his tape machine and slumped into a chair . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pasha . A balloon , a bubble drifting heavenward , an eagle soaring free  --  in short , a man who has successfully evaded responsibility . " " What are you talking about ? I just broke the case . " " There is no case for us anymore . " Arkady described the dead man 's teeth . " An American spy ? " " Who cares , Pasha ? Any dead American will do . Pribluda will have to take jurisdiction now . " " And the credit ! " " Let 's name a day for him . This affair should have been his from the start . A triple execution is n't our kind of case . " " I know the KGB . Those prick-twisters . After we do all the work . " " What work ? We do n't know who the victims are , let alone who killed them . " " They get twice the pay of detectives , their own special shops , fancy sports clubs . " Pasha rolled along on his own track . " Can you tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was never recruited ? There 's something wrong with me because my grandfather happened to be a prince ? No , you have to have a pedigree , sweat and dirt for ten generations , or speak ten languages . " " Pribluda definitely has you beat on the sweat and dirt . I do n't think he speaks more than one language . " " I could speak French or Chinese if I 'd had the chance , " Pasha rolled on . " You speak German . " " Everyone speaks German . No , it 's typical , the story of my life . Now they 'll take the credit when we 've unmasked what , some , some  --  " " Tooth . " " Fuck your mother . " It was the national expression of exasperation , not an insult . Arkady left Pasha in his funk and went to Nikitin 's office . The chief investigator for Governmental Directives was n't in . With a key from Nikitin 's desk , Arkady unlocked a wooden safe , which contained a city telephone directory and four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So you 'd rather be a snotnosed prick-twister than a good detective , " he told Pasha as he returned . Inconsolable , the detective stared at the floor . Arkady poured out two glasses of the vodka . " Drink up . " To what ? " Pasha muttered . " To your grandfather , the prince ! " Arkady offered . Pasha flushed with embarrassment . He stared through the open door at the hall . " To the Czar ! " Arkady added . " Please ! " Pasha shut the door . " Then drink . " After a few drinks , Pasha was n't so forlorn . They saluted the forensic detection of Captain Levin , the inevitable triumph of Soviet justice , and the opening of the sea lanes to Vladivostok . " To the only honest man in Moscow , " Pasha suggested . " Who ? " Arkady asked , expecting a joke. 44 " You , " Pasha said and drank . " Actually "  --  Arkady looked at his own glass  --  " what we 've been doing the past two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he saw the detective 's newly revived spirits start to sag . " Anyway , you said you broke the case ' today . Tell me how . " Pasha shrugged , but Arkady insisted , as he knew the detective wished him to . A day spent talking to old babushkas should have some reward . " It occurred to me "  --  Pasha tried to be matter-of-fact  --  " that maybe something besides snow covered the sound of the gunshots . After wasting most of the day with the food vendors , I go and talk to the little old woman who plays the records over the loudspeakers for the skating in the park during the winter . She has a little room in the building at the Krimsky Val entrance . I ask , Do you play any loud records ? ' She says , Only quiet records for skating . ' I ask , Do you have a program of music you follow every day ? ' She says , Programs are for television , I only play records for skating , quiet records played by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war when I was in the artillery . I earned my job honestly , ' she says , for my disability . ' I say , That 's not my concern , I just want to know the order of the records you play . " The right order , ' she says . I start at the top of the pile and work my way down , and when there are no more records I know it 's time to go home . ' Show me , ' I say . The old woman brings out a stack of fifteen records . They 're even numbered one to fifteen . I was thinkingthe shootings probably took place toward the end of the day , and so I work from the back . Number fifteen , sure enough , is from Swan Lake . Number fourteen , you want to guess ? The ' 1812 Overture . ' Cannons , bells , the works . Finally , I 'm getting smart . Why should the records have to be numbered ? I hold the record in front of my mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records ? ' She just looks ; she has n't heard a thing . The old woman is deaf , that 's her disability , and that 's who they have playing the records in Gorky Park ! " A WEEKEND in the country with the last snow of the winter . Windshieldwipers swatting flakes as thick as goose down . A bottle of spiced vodka to compensate for the car 's inadequate heater . The enthusiastic hiss of tires . Fifes , drums , horns , the galloping bells of a sled . For-ward ! Zoya sat in back with Natalya Mikoyan , Arkady in front with Mikhail Mikoyan , his oldest friend . Together the men had gone through Komsomol , the Army , Moscow University and the Law Faculty . They 'd shared the same ambitions , the same binges , the same poets , some of the same girls , even . Slight and baby-faced under a mop of dark curls , Misha had gone directly from the Law Faculty to the Moscow City Collegium of Advocates . Officially , defense lawyers received no more than judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients paid double or more , which was why Misha could afford good suits , a ruby ring on his little finger , furs for Natasha , a house in the country and a two-door Zhiguli in which to get there . Natasha , dark and so delicate that she could wear children 's clothes , contributed her pay as a Novosti press agency writer and one abortion a year ; she could n't use the pill , though she supplied her friends . Not too much baggage on this sled . Forward ! The dacha was thirty kilometers east of Moscow . As usual , Misha had invited eight or so friends to share the house . When the host 's carload entered , stomping snow off their boots , arms laden with bread , jars of herring and bottles of liquor , they were greeted by a young couple waxing skis and a fat man in a tight sweater trying to light the fireplace . More guests followed : a director of educational films and his mistress ; a ballet dancer trailed ducklike by his wife . Skis fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one room , women in another , the late arrivals changed into outdoor gear. 46 " A white morning . " Misha waved expansively . " Snow more preciousthan rubles . " Zoya said she would stay with Natasha , who was still recovering from her last abortion . Outside , the snow ceased falling and lay deep on the ground . Misha found glory in blazing his own path through the woods . Arkady was content to follow and stop from time to time to admire the low mountains ; he had a long , easy stride , and gaining on Misha 's fevered plunging was no problem . After an hour , they rested so Misha could clean the ice compacted between his shoes and skis . Arkady slipped out of his skis and sat . White breath , white trees , white snow , white sky . " Slim as women , " birches were invariably called . Crutches for poets , too , Arkady thought . Misha worked at the ice the way he worked in court : with a fury , dramatically . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tiny craft with an enormous sail . He hammered at his skis . " Arkasha , I have a problem . " He let the skis drop . " Who is she this time ? " " A new clerk , probably no more than nineteen . I think Natasha suspects . Well , I do n't play chess or sports , what else is there ? The most ridiculous thing is that this child may be the most ignorant person I 've ever met , and I live or die by her opinion . Romance is not a pretty matter , when you get right down to it . Or cheap . Well "  --  he opened his jacket and pulled out a bottle of wine  --  " a little French sauterne here , smuggled home by that dancer you saw flouncing around the house . The finest dessert wine in the world . I do n't have any dessert . Want some ? " Misha unwrapped the tinsel from the top and handed the bottle to Arkady , who slapped its bottom and shot the cork out . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sweet ? " Misha caught Arkady 's grimace . " Not as sweet as some Russian wines , " Arkady said patriotically . They took turns drinking . Snow fell from boughs , sometimes with one heavy thud , sometimes as lightly and rapidly as the steps of a hare . Arkady enjoyed being with Misha , and the best times of all were when Misha shut up . " Is Zoya still on you about the Party ? " Misha asked . " I 'm a Party member , I have a card . " " Hardly . What does it take to be more active ? A meeting once a month where you can read the newspaper if you want . Once a yearMOSCOW LE 47you get out the vote , a couple of times a year you circulate a petition against China or Chile . You do n't even do that . The only reason you have a card is that if you did n't you would n't be chief investigator . Everyone knows , so you might as well get the benefits out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make some contacts . " " I always have a good reason for missing a meeting . " " Sure . No wonder Zoya 's furious . You should think of her a little bit . With your record you 'd be a cinch to be a Central Committee inspector . You could travel all over checking on law-enforcement performance , whipping up campaigns , making the local-militia generalsshit in their pants . " " That does n't sound very appealing . " " That 's unimportant . The main thing is , you 'd have access to Central Committee shops , you 'd be high on the list for foreign travel , and you 'd get close to the men on the Central Committee who make all the major appointments . You 'd be on your way up the ladder . " There was a solid , porcelain quality to the sky . It would squeak if you rubbed your thumb on it , Arkady thought . " I 'm wasting my breath , " Misha said . " You ought to talk to Iamskoy , he likes you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a celebrity , Arkasha ? The Viskov appeal . Before the Supreme Court , Iamskoy denounces the authorities who wrongly arrested and sentenced the young worker Viskov to fifteen years for murder . Moscow Town Prosecutor Iamskoy , of all people , suddenly a protector of individual rights . Practically Gandhi , if you read Pravda . And who reopened the investigation ? You did . Who forced Iamskoy into action by threatening to protest alone to the law journals ? You did . So Iamskoy , seeing you wo n't be moved , takes the completely opposite course and becomes the bold hero of the tale . He owes you a lot . He might also want to see the last of you . " " Since when do you talk to Iamskoy ? " Arkady was interested . " Oh , well , lately . There was a little problem of a client who claimed he 'd overpaid me . He did n't overpay me  --  I got the son of a bitch off . Anyway , the prosecutor has been surprisingly understanding . Your name came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave it at that . " Misha overcharged so much that an acquitted man complained ? Arkady had never put the word " venal " by his friend before . Misha himself seemed depressed by his confession . " I actually got the son of a bitch off . Do you know how rarely48  --  tomthat happens ? You know what you 're doing when you engage a defenselawyer ? You 're paying a man to come before the court and disassociate himself from you . True ! That 's what almost always happens . After all , you would n't be on trial if you were n't guilty , and I do n't want any guilt by association , I have my own much better name to worry about . Before the prosecutor even has a chance to point a finger , I publicly deplore this criminal 's acts . I am not only outraged , I 'm nauseated . If my client 's lucky I might mention he never farted on Red Army Day . " " That 's not true . " " A little true . Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did everything . My client was not a thief , he was a father of small children , he was the son and support of the crippled woman sobbing in the first row , he was a modest veteran of famous battles , he was a faithful friend and an unstinting worker who was not a thief but only weak . Soviet justice , that narcoleptic judge and two ignorant arbiters , is harsh , yes , harsh as a feudal lord and human in the same way . Try to be smart and you 'll lose your head . But throw yourself on their breasts , say it was the vodka , it was this woman , it was a moment of madness and who knows what might happen ? Naturally , everybody tries it , so you have to be an artist to rise above the general pathos . I did , Arkasha . I even cried myself . " Misha paused . " Why did I ask for so much money ? " Arkady tried to think of something to say . " I ran into Viskov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His father manages a cafeteria near Paveletsky Station . What a story their lives have been . " " I truly despair ! " Misha exploded . " You 'll never know who to cultivate . Two days ago , I was lunching at the Writers Union with the eminent historian Tomashevski . " The small craft that was Misha was off on a new tack with a fresh wind . " That 's the sort of man you should know . Respected , charming , has n't produced a piece of work in ten years . He has a system , which he explained to me . First , he submits an outline for a biography to the Academy to be absolutely sure his approach is consistent with Party policy . A crucial first step , as you 'll see later . Now , the person he studies is always an important figure  --  that is , someone from Moscow  --  hence Tomashevski must do his Russian research close to home for two years . But this historical character also traveled , yes , lived for some years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apply for and receive permissionfor foreign residence . Four years have passed . The Academy and the Party arc rubbing their hands in anticipation of this seminal studyMOSCOW Ka 49of the important figure by the eminent Tomashevski . And now Tomashevskimust retire to the solitude of a dacha outside Moscow to tend his garden and creatively brood over his cartons of research . Two more years pass in seminal thought . And just as Tomashevski is about to commit himself to paper , he checks with the Academy again only to learn that Party policy has totally about-faced ; his hero is a traitor , and with regrets all around , Tomashevski must sacrifice his years of labor for the greater good . Naturally , they are only too happy to urge Tomashevski to start a new project , to plow under his grief with fresh labor . Tomashevski is now studying a very important historical figure who lived for some time in the South of France . He says there is always a bright future for Soviet historians , and I believe him . " Abruptly Misha changed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard about those bodies in Gorky Park , that you had another run-in with Major Pribluda . Are you crazy ? " When they returned , everyone but Natasha was gone . " Zoya left with some people from the dacha down the road , " she told Arkady . " Someone with a German name . " " She means Schmidt . " Misha sat by the fire to work on the ice in his boots . " You must know Schmidt , Arkasha . From Moscow . He just took over the place down the road . Maybe he 's Zoya 's new lover . " Reading Arkady 's face , Misha saw the truth . His mouth open , his face red , he held his dripping boot . " Do that in the kitchen , Misha , " Natasha said , and pushed Arkady down on the couch and poured glasses of vodka for herself and him while her husband stumbled out . " He 's a silly man . " She nodded toward the kitchen . " He did n't know what he was saying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's his method  --  he never knows what he 's saying . He says everything , so he has to be right some of the time . " " You know what you 're saying , though ? " Arkady asked . Natasha had a quietly arch sense of humor . The softest dark shadows around her eyes made them appear brighter by contrast . I Icr neck was so thin that she put him in mind of a starving child , an odd thing to become for a woman in her thirties . " I 'm Zoya 's friend . I 'm your friend . Actually , I 'm more Zoya 's friend . Actually , I 've been telling her to leave you for years . " " Why ? " " You do n't love her . The fact is , if you loved her you would50 MI MOSCOW Lg 51make her happy . If you loved her , you 'd do what Schmidt does . They were meant for each other . " She poured more for Arkady and herself . " If you care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her be finally happy . " Natasha started to giggle . She tried to keep a straight face , but her pretty lips kept curling . She 'd been as much of a clown as Misha when they 'd all been at school . " Because , the fact is , you find her very boring . She had two or three good years when you made her interestingall by yourself . Now , even I admit it , she 's boring . And you 're not . " She ran the back of a finger along his wrist . " You 're the only man I know anymore who 's not . " Natasha poured herself one more before going off to the kitchen very carefully and quite drunk , leaving Arkady alone in the living room . The room was hot , so was the vodka . Misha and Natasha had touched up the place with ikons and quaint wooden figurines , and in the gold leaf of the ikons were reflections of the fire . Do for Zoya what Schmidt did for her ? Arkady opened his wallet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lenin on the cover . On the left were his name , photograph and Party district . On the right , his dues stamps  --  he noticed that he was two months behind . On the last page a selection of inspirational precepts . The famous Party card . " There is only one way to succeed , there is only one thing , there is nothing else , " Zoya had said . She was naked when she 'd said it ; the contrast between her card and her skin was something he remembered . He looked at an ikon . It was of a Madonna , a Virgin . The Byzantine face , especially the eyes gazing back , reminded him not of Zoya , nor of Natasha , but of the girl he 'd met at Mosfilm . " To Irina . " He raised his glass . By midnight , everyone had returned and everyone was drunk . There was a buffet of cold pork and sausages , fish , blini , cheeses and breads , pickled mushrooms , even pressed caviar . Someone was shoutingpoetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a Hungarianversion of the Bee Gees . Misha was stricken with guilt and could n't keep his eyes off Zoya sitting close to Schmidt . " I thought we were going to spend this weekend together , " Arkady said the one time he got Zoya alone in the kitchen . " How did Schmidt get into it ? " " I invited him . " She carried out a bottle of wine . " To Zoya Renko "  --  Schmidt raised his glass at her return  --  " selected yesterday by her District Committee to speak on new chatlengesin education before the entire City Committee , making us all very proud  --  especially , I 'm sure , her husband . " Arkady came out of the kitchen to find everyone looking at him except Schmidt , who was winking at Zoya . Natasha saved Arkady from more confusion by handing him a drink . A sentimental Georgian crooner slipped down on the turntable , and Schmidt and Zoya rose to dance . They 'd danced before , Arkady could tell . Balding but trim , Schmidt was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accustomed to leading . He had the thick neck of a gymnast and , the black-rimmed glasses of a Party thinker . His hand almost covered Zoya 's back as she leaned into him . " To Comrade Schmidt . " Misha hoisted a bottle as the song ended . " To Comrade Schmidt we drink a toast not because he 's gained a sinecure at a District Committee doing crossword puzzles and selling office supplies on the side , because I can remember once taking home a paper clip myself . " Misha spilled some vodka and nodded happily at everyone , only getting started . " We drink to him not because he attends Party conferencesat beach resorts on the Black Sea , because last year I was allowed to fly to Murmansk . We drink not because the District Committee buys him cases of fine wine , because we all get to stand in line for a warm beer from time to time . We drink not because he wants our wives , because the rest of us can always masturbate if need be . Nor because he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the advantage of the world 's greatest subway system . Not even because his sexual habits include necrophilia , sadism and homosexuality because  --  please , comrades  --  we are no longer living in the Dark Ages . No , " Misha concluded , " we drink to Comrade Dr. Schmidt for none of these reasons . The reason we drink to him is because he is such a good Communist . " Schmidt showed a smile as hard as a car grille . Dancing , talking , sitting became increasingly drunken . Arkady was in the kitchen making coffee for five minutes before he realized that the film maker was lying with the dancer 's wife in a corner . 1lc hacked out and left his cup . In the living room Misha sleepily danced with his head on Natasha 's shoulder . Arkady climbed the steps to his bedroom , and was about to open the door when Schmidt came out and shut it . " I drink to you , " Schmidt whispered , " because your wife is a great screw . " 5 2Arkady hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounced off the door he hit him in the mouth . Schmidt landed on both knees and rolled all the way down the steps . At the bottom his glasses fell off and he threw up . " What happened ? " Zoya stood at the bedroom door . " You know , " Arkady said . He saw loathing and fear in her face ; what he had n't expected to see shine so brightly was relief . " Bastard , you , " she said and ran down the stairs to Schmidt . " I only said hello to him . " Schmidt groped for his glasses . Zoya found them , wiped them on her sweater and helped the District Party leader to his feet . " He 's an investigator ? " Schmidt asked through split lips . " He 's crazy . " " Liar ! " Arkady shouted . No one heard . Arkady realized , his heart pounding at great speed , that Schmidt had lied at the bedroom door . This once , no , they had n't quite worked up to fucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband was there . Arkady had believed the lie because it was truer than his marriage , and there was no way to explain that . Everything was backwards . Zoya was militantly outraged ; Arkady , the cuckold , was ashamed . From the front of the dacha he watched Schmidt and Zoya drive off . Her lover 's car was an old two-seater Zaporozhets , not a limousine . There was a full moon over the birches . " I 'm sorry , " Misha said as Natasha thoughtfully wiped the rug in the living room. 4JAM S K o Y S A I D , " Your work is , as always , a model . The discovery of this victim 's dental work , coming as quickly as it did , was a bombshell . I immediately ordered a thorough investigation by the organs of State Security . This investigation went on throughout the weekend -- while you were away from the city  --  and involved a computerized review of thousands of foreign residents and known foreign agents dating back five years . The sum result was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be accounted for . It is the opinion of the analysts that we are still dealing with a Soviet citizen who had this particular dental work performed on him while visiting the United States , or by a European dentist trained there . Because all possible aliens have been accounted for , I am forced to concur in this opinion . " The prosecutor spoke with great earnestness and sincerity . Brezhnev had the same gift that set the style : a direct , low-keyed reasonableness that had taken so much into account that its authority was self-evident and there was no sense in argument ; argument , in fact , would be a betrayal of the air of reasonableness so generously set . " I 'm in the position , Arkady Vasilevich , of determining whether I as prosecutor now insist that the KGB assume responsibility of this investigation or allow you to continue your fine work . The merest chance that there might be foreign involvement is disturbing . Clearly , there is the possibility of your investigation being cut short . That being the case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamskoy paused as if he were considering the question . " There is more involved , though . At one time there would have been no question ; the MVD would have investigated Russian or foreigneralike , in the same basket without discrimination , without public trial , arrested them and sentenced them without the slightest regard for socialist legality . You know what I 'm talking about  --  Bcria and his54 mclique . These were excesses carried out by a handful of men , but we can not turn our faces . The Twentieth Party Congress dragged these excesses into the daylight and instituted the reforms under which we now operate . The MVD militia now is strictly limited to interior criminal matters . The KGB , likewise , is strictly limited to matters of national security . The role of prosecutors in overseeing and protecting the rights of citizens has been reinforced , and the independence of investigators has been articulated . Socialist legality is built upon this division of powers so that no Soviet citizen can ever again be deprived of his full rights in open court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an investigator and hand it to the KGB ? It 's a step backward . This particular victim probably was Russian . Did n't he have other dental work , a steel molar , that was distinctly Russian ? There 's no doubt the other two victims were Russian . The perpetrators of this crime and the wide variety of people touched by this inquiry are Russian . Yet here I would be  --  on no real evidence  --  muddying the waters of reform , and bringing into confusion the separate powers of our two arms of the law . What does my duty to protect civil rights mean if I do that ? What does your independence signify if at the first moment of indecision you abdicate it ? Avoiding our responsibilities would be easy but , I am convinced , wrong . " " What exactly would convince you the other way ? " Arkady asked . " If you proved the victim or killer was not Russian . " " I ca n't . But I do feel that one victim was not Russian , " Arkady said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed , as an adult sighs to a child . " It occurred to me this weekend , " Arkady said quickly before he was dismissed , " what the victims were doing . " " Yes ? " " Gesso and sawdust and gold dust were found in the victims ' clothes . Those items are all materials used in the restoration of ikons . Ikons are a very popular item on the black market , even more to foreign tourists than to Russians . " " Go on . " " There is a chance this one victim was foreign , and from the evidence on his clothes , that he was engaged in black-market activity , where foreigners are heavily involved . To be absolutely certain that we arc not dealing with a foreigner , that we are operating within our limits , I want Major Pribluda to deliver tapes and transcripts of allaliens who were in Moscow in January and February . The KGB will never do it , but I want my request and his answer recorded . " lamskoy smiled . Both men understood the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Pribluda to assume jurisdictionof the case now rather than later . " Are you serious ? That is a provocative  --  some would say out-rageous  --  action . " " Yes , " Arkady said. lamskoy was taking more time to turn him down than Arkady had expected . Something in the proposal seemed to intrigue the prosecutor . " I must say I am always amazed by your intuitive mind . You 've never been wrong yet , have you ? And you are the senior investigator in Moscow . If you really are set on this , would you consider all nondiplomaticaliens ? " For a moment Arkady was too stunned to reply . " Yes . " " That can be arranged . " Iamskoy made a note on a piece of paper . " Anything else ? " " And current tapes , " Arkady added quickly . Who knew when the prosecutor would ever be so agreeable again ? " The investigation will also be expanded to other areas . " " I know you to be an investigator of infinite resources and zeal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autopsy table . " Andreev will want the neck , too , " Levin said . The pathologist put a wooden block under the neck , making it bow up , and pulled back the hair . With a rotary saw he sliced through the bones . The smell of burning calcium spread . Arkady had no cigarettes ; he held his breath . Levin cut under the seventh cervical vertebra along the angle of the vertebra 's spur . As bone separated , head and neck rolled off the table . Arkady reflexively caught the head , and as quickly put it back . Levin switched off the saw . " No , Investigator , she 's all yours now . " Arkady wiped his hands . The head was thawed . " I 'll need a box . " What were the dead , anyway , but witnesses of man 's evolution from primate indolence to civilized industry ? And each witness , every56 MOSCOW yA 57bundle of bones hacked out of peat moss or tundra , was itself a new clue to add to that mosaic called prehistory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a necklace of elk teeth , all were dragged out of their ancient graves , packed in newspapers and dispatched to the Soviet Academy 's Institute of Ethnology overlooking Gorky Park , there to be cleaned , wired together and scientifically resurrected . Not all its mysteries were prehistoric . For example , an officer returning to his Leningrad boardinghouse at the end of the war noticeda stain on his ceiling . Searching the attic for the stain 's source , he found a dismembered , half-mummified body , which the militia identifiedas the corpse of a man . After a long , unsuccessful investigation , the militia sent a cast of the skull to the Institute of Ethnology to be reconstructed . The problem was , the anthropologists reconstructed the face of a woman , not a man . Disgusted , the militia destroyed the face and closed the case , until the boardinghouse yielded a photo of a girl . Her picture matched a picture of the face the anthropologists had made , she was identified and her murderer was convicted . Since then the institute had reconstructed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for criminal identification . There was no similar method used by any other police anywhere . Some of the institute 's reconstructions were merely crude sculptures in plaster ; others , the creations of Andreev , were striking not only in their detail but in their animated expressions of anxiety or outright fear . The effect in court when one of Andreev 's heads was revealed was always a prosecutor 's moment of triumph . " Come in , come in . " Arkady followed the voice into a gallery of heads . The nearest cabinet displayed national types  --  Turkman , Uzbek , Kalmuk , etc.  --  assembled with the sort of vacant gazes that typify group portraits . A cabinet of monks came next , then one of Africans and so on . Beyond , in the haze of a skylight , was a table of busts of freshly memorialized cosmonauts , their paint still fresh . Not one he saw had Andreev 's touch , until Arkady passed the skylight and stopped short . In the shadow at the end of the room , startled by the investigator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were some semi-humans in a row . Peking Man , his lips pulled back over yellowed fangs . Rhodesian Man , trying to concentrate without a forehead . Something female with the woeful cheeks of an orangutan . A Neanderthaloid , heavy-lipped and sly . A young dwarf with vigorously curly hair , his elongated head crossed by a single brow , his hands and cut-down laboratory smock white with plaster . ' I'lhe dwarf slid off a stool . " You 're the investigator who called ? " " Yes . " Arkady looked for someplace to put his box . " Do n't bother , " Andreev said . " I 'm not going to do the head for you . I do n't do forensic work for the militia anymore , not unless the case has been unsolved for at least a year . It 's a selfish rule , but you 'd be amazed how often the militia is able to solve a crime on its own within a year . Someone should have told you that . " " I knew about it . " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a short arm gesturing to the busts around him . " As you are here , let me give you a short tour before you go . Our collection of humanoids , which so caught your eye . They 're fairly striking . Usually stronger than us , sometimes with a greater brain capacity , even contemporariesof ours in some cases , but condemned for their inability to write the texts on evolution , so let us pass them by . " His rolling step brought him close to Arkady and a gilded case containing the bust of a nomadic Tartar . Arkady was surprised he 'd missed it . The face was flat and spare , not alive but having lived , as if its cheekbones ' deep lines had been sliced by wind instead of a sculptor 's knife . A mosqueshapedcrown , red mustache and spade beard were ever so slightly tattered , thinned as an old man 's are . " Homo sapiens . Tamerlane , the greatest killer in history . The skull showed a left-sided paralysis . We also had his hair to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustache grew . " Arkady stared at the Tartar until Andreev turned on the light inside a second gilded case , which contained an oversized man 's head slumped against the rough monk 's cowl . Though the forehead was high , the rest of the face , its long nose , purple lips and beard , sagged from gravity or self-loathing . The glass eyes seemed not so much dead as extinguished . " Ivan the Terrible , " Andreev continued . " Buried as a monk under the Kremlin . Another killer . He poisoned himself with the mercuryhe rubbed in to ease the pain of arthritis . He also had an occlusionof his teeth that must have made his smile a grimace . Do you find him ugly ? " " Is n't he ? " " Not unusually . He did avoid court painters in his later years , as if lie wanted to bury that face with him . " " Ile was only a murderer , " Arkady said . " I lc was n't stupid . " The two men were now near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour was at its end . He made no move to leave , and Andreev began studying him . " You 're Renko 's son , are n't you ? I 've seen his picture many times . I do n't see much of him in you . " " I had a mother , too . " " Sometimes that is a distinction . " Empathy almost showed in Andreev 's face ; his horse-sized teeth nearly smiled up at Arkady . " A man who 's willing to admit that should at least be listened to . Very well , let 's see what you brought . Maybe someone else wants to waste their time . " Andreev led the way to a corner that held a potter 's wheel under a fluorescent light . Wbile he climbed a stool to pull the light cord , Arkady opened his box and brought the head out by its hair . Andreev took the head and put it on the wheel and softly fanned out the long brown hair . " Young , about twenty , female , Europoid , nicely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he started explaining about the three murders . " Do n't try to interest me in your case ; three more heads hardly matter here . The mutilation is , of course , unusual . " " The murderer thinks her face is erased . You can bring it back , " Arkady said . Andreev pushed the wheel , and shadows swung within the orbitalcavities of the head . " Maybe she walked by here that day , " Arkady said . " It was early in February . Maybe you saw her . " " I do n't spend my time looking at women . " " You 're a man of special powers , Professor . You can look at her now . " " There are others here who do very nice reconstructions . I have more important work . " " More important than the fact that two men and this girl were murdered almost in sight of your windows ? " " I only reconstruct , Investigator . I ca n't bring her back to life . " Arkady put the box on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered about the Lubyanka , the KGB prison on Dzerzhinsky Square , but most Muscovites who broke the law and got caught ended up in Lefortovo Prison on the east side of town . A guard took the investigator down in an elevator that was a pre-Revolutionarycage . Where was Zoya now ? She 'd called to tell him not to expect her back at the apartment . Thinking about her , he couldn'tMOSCOW Kat 59recall anything except her face at the bedroom door in Misha 's dacha . The triumph on her face , as if an opponent had played a trump card too soon . Other than that , there was very little . Meanwhile another phenomenon was taking place . Iamskoy had ordered tapes from Pribluda . A head had been delivered for reconstruction . Under the guise of pretense , without his will , a real investigation was taking shape . The subbasement . Arkady went down a hall of small iron doors that looked like furnace mouths , past a guard scribbling at a desk , by an open room stuffed with mattresses and reeking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Chief Investigator of Special Cases Chuchin , the blandest figment of a man , staring , eyes aglitter , one hand clutching his belt buckle , and a woman , sitting , turning away to spit into a handkerchief . " You  --  " Chuchin blocked Arkady 's view of her , but Arkady ' was looking a second time at what he 'd seen : the door swinging open , Chuchin 's initial amazement , the hand closing the buckle , the redfacedgirl  --  young but plain  --  turning in her chair to spit . Chuchin , the smoothest-featured of men , a mustache of sweat on his upper lip , buttoned his jacket and pushed Arkady into the hall . " An interrogation ? " Arkady asked . " Not a political , just a whore . " Even Chuchin 's voice was mild , as if he were identifying a type of dog . Arkady had come with a request . He did n't have to request anymore . " Give me the key to your files . " " Fuck off . " " The prosecutor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrogation . " Arkady put out his hand for the key . " You do n't have the nerve . " Arkady 's hand closed on the crotch of Chuchin 's pants and on the softening prick , the prick of Special Cases inside the pants , and squeezed Chuchin to his tiptoes so that the two men could see eye toeye . " I 'll kill you for this , Renko , wait and see , " Chuchin said huskily , but he gave up the key . Arkady spread the files over Chuchin 's desk . No investigator showed another his files . Each was a specialist , And where their activities did overlap , their separate files contained the identities of personally groomed informers . Especially in Special Gases . What were Special Cases ? If the KGB were to arrest all politi-6o a MOSCOW a 61cal offenders , their sheer numbers would exaggerate their importance . Better that some be arrested by the prosecutor 's office for normal crimes that the average citizen could understand . For example : The historian B. , a correspondent of exiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet F. , a samizdat courier , was charged with stealing books from the Lenin Library . The technician M. , a Social Democrat , was arrested in the act of selling religious ikons to the informant G. This grab bag was an insult to real investigators . Arkady 's attitude had always been to ignore Chuchin , as if to deny his existence . He 'd hardly spoken to the man , let alone touched him . Arkady 's eye was caught by Chuchin 's references to " the informantG. , " " the alert citizen G. , " " the reliable source G. " Fully half the arrests involving ikons were battened by that single letter . He went to Chuchin 's budget accounts . On a list of informants G. was at the top with 1,500 rubles . There was a telephone number . From his own office Arkady called the telephone exchange . The number belonged to a Feodor Golodkin . Pasha 's tape machine was by the desk . Arkady put a fresh tape on it and dialed the phone . After five rings it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feodor there ? " Arkady asked . " Who is this ? " " A friend . " " Give me a number to call you back at . " " Let 's talk now . " Click . When the first cartons came from Pribluda , Arkady felt some of the exhilaration that even illusory progress brings . There were thirteen Intourist hotels in Moscow , with a total of over twenty thousand guest rooms , half equipped with listening devices , and while only 5 percent might be monitored at a time , even fewer taped and transcribed , the accumulation of material was impresive . " You may come across some innocent who talks openly about buying ikons or meeting someone in the park , but do n't expect it , " Arkady told Pasha and Fet . " Do n't bother reading transcripts of anyoneaccompanied by an Intourist guide . Do n't bother with foreign newspapermen or priests or politicians ; they 're watched too closely . Concentrate on tourists or foreign businessmen who know their way around , speak Russian , have contacts here . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A tape of the black nlarketeer Golodkin is on this machine so that you can match hisvoice on another tape , but do n't lose sight of the fact that he may not be involved . " " Ikons ? " Fet asked . " How did we decide on them ? " " Marxist dialectic , " Arkady answered . " Dialectic ? " " We are now in an intermediate stage of communism where there are still criminal tendencies resulting from relics of capitalism in the minds of some individuals . What more obvious relic than an ikon ? " Arkady opened a pack of cigarettes and passed one to Pasha . " Besides , gesso and gold dust were found on the victims ' clothes . Gesso 's a primer for wood , and about the only legal use of gold is for restoring ikons . " " You mean this could be tied to an art theft ? " Fet asked . " Like the case at the Hermitage a couple of years ago . Remember , a gang of electricians were taking crystals from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Ikon fakers , not thieves . " Pasha bummed a match . " That 's where the sawdust on their clothes came from , from woodworking . " He stopped and blinked . " Did I just do some dialectic ? " After a day of listening to tapes , without enough energy left to confront his apartment , Arkady wandered until he found himself under the Imperial Roman main entrance of Gorky Park , where he bought himself a supper of meat pies and lemonade . On the skating rink , muscular girls in short flared skirts skated backward from a boy with an accordion . The boy pumped gasps of music . The loudspeakers were silent ; the deaf woman had put away her records . The sun set into steamy clouds . Arkady walked on to the amusement section . On a good weekend there might be a thousand kids riding the rocket ride and pedal cars , plinking wooden ducks with an air rifle or watching a magic show at the amphitheater . He 'd come often enough himself as a kid with the then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the other wise guys in their group . He remembered when the Czechs opened the first foreign exhibition in the park , the Pilsen beer pavilion in ' 56 . Suddenly , of all things , beer was popular . Everyone was pouring it into his vodka . Everyone was happy and drunk . He remembered when The Magnificent Seven came to Moscow , and every male between the ages of twelve and twenty started walking like Yul Brynner ; Gorky Park seemed to be full of stiff-legged cowboys looking for their mounts . A time when everyone was a cowboy . Amazing ! What were they now ? City planners , factory62 Moscow ul 63managers , Party members , car owners , ikon buyers , Krokodil readers , television critics , opera goers , fathers and mothers . There were n't many kids today . Two old men slapped dominoes in the dusk . Pushcart vendors huddled together in their white caps and aprons . A toddler sought the limits of an elastic band held by a grandmother . On the Ferris wheel at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the operator , a boy with skin problems , leafed through a motorcycle magazine , damned if he was going to release the brake just for two pensioners . As the wind picked up , the cars rocked and the old woman edged closer to her husband . " Take it up . " Arkady presented a ticket to the operator and sat in a car . " Now . " The wheel shrugged and revolved , and Arkady rose above tree level . Although sunlight lingered in the west , past Lenin Hills , lamps were coming on across the city and he could make out traffic rings like concentric halos : the tree-lined boulevards around the inner city , the Sadovaya Ring reaching the park , the Outer Ring as vague as the Milky Way . That was one of the things about Gorky Park ; it was the only place in the city where you could fantasize . You had to have a special pass to join the fantasies of Mosfilm , but everyone was welcome in the park . At one time Arkady had planned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period was a wrinkle of useless information on the cortex . He 'd watched Sputnik pass over Gorky Park twenty years ago . Well , no regrets . Everyone left such ghosts in the park ; it was a great and pleasant grave . He and Misha , Pasha , Pribluda and Fet , Zoya and Natasha . It offended him that someone had left bodies in it . Round again . The ancient couple a few cars ahead rode without a word , the way pre-Revolutionaries often did when they came to the capital . It was the Great Patriotic War crowd who were larded with enough self-confidence to push and shout . While their grandchildren sat outside the cathedrals of the Kremlin and picked their noses , the salute of heirs . He shifted to get comfortable against the metal seat . Below , the park rose into hills , ran by the militia station and divided into romanticwalks , off one of which " 40 meters north of the footpath on a line with Donskoy Street and the river " three people had been killed . Despitethe growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of it with a flashlight . On the next pass by the ground Arkady jumped off . It was half a kilometer to the clearing , and he began running in long strides , alternatelyskidding on ice and regaining his balance . The path twisted uphill . Zoya was right ; he should have exercised . Stupid cigarettes . IIe reached the militia station , just as cozy as Pasha had described but empty , not even a car around , so he kept on moving as the path became steeper . Consciously he pulled his knees up and his elbows back in some sort of rhythm , out of beat with the slap of his shoes and the rasp of his windpipe . After three hundred meters of sprinting his stride was as short as a baby 's . He felt as if he 'd run for hours . The path leveled just as side stitches started tugging , and it would probably only be Detective Fet doing some homework , he told himself . Where the militia van had turned off the path four days before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ice popped underfoot . The light was gone ; the searcher was gone or smart enough to block the light from the path . There was no definition to help because the clearing , stripped of snow , was totally black . No sounds . He moved from tree to tree around the clearing , stopping in a crouch , staring . He was about to move again when a beam of light shone on the shallow trench from which the bodies had been removed . Arkady was about ten meters into the clearing when the light disappeared . " Who 's there ? " he called . Someone ran the other way . Arkady followed . The clearing sloped down to a copse of trees , he knew . Beyond that would be a steep bank , some bowers for chess tables , another path , trees , then a jump down to the Pushkinskaya quay road and the river . " Stop ! Militia ! " he shouted . He could n't shout more and run , too . He was gaining . The footstepsahead were heavy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun , he never carried it . The copse neared , leaping forward like the crest of a wave . The fugitive reached the trees first , breaking through branches . There 'd be lights on the lower path , Arkady thought , and many lights on the quay road . He put his arms out as he reached the trees . He ducked when he heard an arm drawing back , but it was n't a punch , it was a kick at his groin . As his breath rushed out he grabbed for the foot and got a fist in the neck . IIe swung and missed . Another kick knocked him back . his second swing hit a stomach that was64MOSCOW 65round and hard . A shoulder pinned him against a tree while fingers stabbed his kidneys . Arkady 's mouth found an ear , and bit . " Son of a bitch . " In English . The shoulder jumped back . " Militia . . . " Arkady tried to shout , but it came out a whisper . A kick dropped him face first into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time an investigator hits anyone in years he loses his wife . The second time he bawls for help . He pulled himself up , listened for the sound of branches shaking , and followed . The slope pitched toward the river . He half fell . The lower path was empty , but he saw feet dissolving in the trees beyond . Arkady took the path in one stride and leaped , coming down on a broad back . The two men rolled through the dark until they hit a bench . Arkady tried to lock the man 's wrist back , but their coats were too tangled for either to do anything until the man twisted free . Arkady tripped him and , swinging as wildly as ever , knocked him off his feet again . But as soon as they were separated , Arkady had n't a chance . A palm slapped his face , and before he began to react the same hand as a fist shot into the ribs under his heart . He stood in feeble admiration long enough for the fist to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop . This is a vast improvement over primitive methods , the collective'sdirector told Arkady and his father , and pulled the cow 's head into a pillory over which was a large metal cylinder that at the flick of a switch drove an oil-slicked piston square into the cow 's cranium , the animal 's legs flying into a comic spread . Cowhide for tankers ' helmets , he remembered . Let me try it , General Renko said , and pulled anothercow to the pillory . Whomp ! Imagine being able to use one 's hands like that . Arkady pulled himself out of a drift and staggered , holding his chest . Trees and snow sucked him downhill to a stone wall . He eased over and collapsed onto the sidewalk of the Pushkinskaya quay . Truck lights sailed along the sweep of the quay road . He could see no one walking . No militiamen . Streetlamps were furry balls , like the bubbles of air he gagged down . The trucks moved on and he was left alone , unsteadily crossing the road . The river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretching toward Lenin Stadium to the west , and by unlit ministry buildings to the east . The Krimsky suspension bridge was at least a kilometer away . Close at Arkady 's left was a subway bridge with no walkway . Over it rattled a train , wheels sparking . A figure was running on the river under the bridge . There were no stairs . Arkady slid three meters down the curving stone embankment , his ass taking the punishment of a violent landing on the ice . He picked himself up and started running . Moscow was a low city . From the river it almost disappeared into its own somnolent ether . The footsteps were closer . The man was powerful , not fast ; even limping , Arkady still gained . There were no stairs along the north embankment either , but he saw on the embankment toward the stadium the docks for summer excursion boats . The man stopped for breath , looked back at Arkady and moved on again . They were more than halfway across the ice , about forty meters apart . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and raised his hand with such authority that Arkady found himself halted . Ice created an illusion of luminescence . He could make out a stocky figure in an overcoat and cap . The face was hidden . " Away , " it said in Russian . When Arkady stepped forward , the hand lowered . He saw a barrel . The man aimed with both hands the way detectives were trained to fire a gun , and Arkady dove . He heard no shot and saw no flash , but something smacked off the ice behind him and , an instant later , rang off stones . The figure lumbered again to the far side of the river . At the embankment Arkady caught up . Water had run down the stone wall and frozen to an uneven slickness on the ice , and there the two men struggled in the shadow of the bridge , slipping first on their feet and then on their knees . Arkady 's nose bled and the other man lost his cap . A blow on the chest no harder than a tap put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took two kicks in the side and , as efficient as a hammer 's final measure , a shoe on the back of the head . When he turned over , the man was gone . Sitting up , he discovered in his hand the man 's cap . Above , more sizzling wheels crossed the sky . Small fireworks for small victories . MOSCOW 30 67STALIN GOTHIC was not so much an architectural style as a form of worship . Elements of Greek , French , Chinese and Italian masterpieceshad been thrown into the barbarian wagon and carted to Moscowand the Master Builder Himself , who had piled them one on the other into the cement towers and blazing torches of His rule , monstrousskyscrapers of ominous windows , mysterious crenellations and dizzying towers that led to the clouds , and yet still more rising spires surmounted by ruby stars that at night glowed like His eyes . After His death , His creations were more embarrassment than menace , too big for burial with Him , so they stood , one to each part of town , great brooding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Kievskaya District , west of the river , was the Hotel Ukraina . " Is n't this great ? " Pasha spread his arms . Arkady looked down from the fourteenth floor of the Ukraina at the broad boulevard of Kutuzovsky Prospekt , and across Kutuzovsky'straffic at the obeisant buildings of the diplomatic and **27;8801;TOOLONG with its center courtyard and militia kiosk . " Like Spy Smasher . " Pasha surveyed a suite of tape machines , cartons , tables and cots . " You really swing some weight , Arkady . " Actually it was Iamskoy who had moved the base of the investigation , citing the lack of space in Arkady 's own office . There was no mention of who had occupied the suite before , though there was a poster of blond airline stewardesses of the Democratic German Airlinetaped to a wall . Even Detective Fet was impressed . " Detective Pavlovich is taking the German tourists and Golodkin , the man you suspect of dealing in ikons . I am familiar with the Scandinavian languages . When I was considering a naval career , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is that so ? " Arkady rubbed his neck . His whole body achedfrom the beating he 'd taken the night before ; he could n't honestly call it a fight . It ached to fish for a cigarette , and it gave him a headache to consider being attached to a headset . His Army career had consisted of sitting in a radio shed on the fraternal socialist side of Berlin and listening to Allied transmissions . A duller job could n't be imagined , yet his two detectives clearly shared a commonality of bliss . After all , here they were in a luxury hotel with their feet resting on a carpet instead of beating a sidewalk . " I 'll take English and French , " he said . The phone rang . It was Lyudin reporting on the cap lost by the man who had beaten up the chief investigator . " The cap is new , Russian manufacture , of cheap serge , and it contained two gray hairs . A protein analysis of the hairs indicates the cap 's wearer to be Europoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hair was lanolin-based , of foreign manufacture . Casts of the man 's heel prints from the park showed the unworn factory imprint of new shoes , also Russian . We also have your heel prints . " " Worn ? " " Badly . " . Arkady hung up and looked at his shoes . Not only were the heels worn , but the original green color of the leather showed through black polish . " Son of a bitch ! " the man had said when Arkady bit him . Americanssay that . An American son of a bitch . " These German girls , " Pasha said as he listened to a tape through his headset . " Secretaries for the German Export Bank . Live at the Rossiya Hotel and pick up men right on the hotel dance floor . A Russian prostitute , one of our own , would be thrown out of the Rossiyaon her ass . " Arkady 's own tapes had peccadilloes . He eavesdropped on the tirades of a French-speaking liberation fighter from Chad who roomed at the Peking Hotel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his difficulty in procuring partners . Girls were afraid that after fornicating once with a black man , years hence they might give birth to " a monkey . " Up with Soviet education ! The demand for so many tapes and transcripts was only to scare Pribluda . It did n't matter that sensitive material would n't be delivered ; someone in the KGB 's chain of command only had to know that the holy of holies ( tapes and transcripts , those other people 's secrets that only the initiated were empowered to paw ) were in the hands of a rival organization . Any transgression was transgression enough . ' I ' lie cartons would go back , and with them , Arkady was sure , the whole68roj MOSCOW ive 69 investigation . He had n't mentioned yet that the man who 'd roughed him up was probably American , or that he 'd taken Beauty 's head to Andreev . He could n't prove the one , and nothing had happened with the other . He listened to the tape of one tourist while he read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephones , so he heard calls and conversations alike . The French all complained about the food , and the Americans and English all complained about the waiters . Travel was so irritating . During lunch in a cafeteria off the hotel lobby , Arkady called Zoya 's school . For once , she came to the phone . " I want to come over and talk to you , " he said . " It 's the month before May Day , you know how that is , " Zoya answered . " I can pick you up after school . " " No ! " " When ? " " I do n't know . Later on , when I know what I 'm doing . I have to go . " Before she hung up he heard Schmidt in the background . The afternoon was endless , though the time came when Pasha and Fet put on their hats and coats and went home . Arkady stopped work for coffee . In the dark he made out two more of His skyscrapers close by , Moscow University to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their ruby stars glowed to each other . Alone , listening again to tapes , he heard his first familiar voice . The tape was of an American 's party given on January 12 at the Rossiya Hotel . The voice was that of a Russian guest , an angry woman : " Chekhov , naturally . Always relevant , they say , because of his critical attitude toward the petty bourgeoisie , his deep-rooted Demo- cratic feelings and his absolute faith in the strength of the people . The truth is , in a Chekhov film you can dress the actresses in decent hats instead of scarves . Once a year they want a film with nice hats . " Arkady recognized the voice of Irina Asanova , the girl at Mos- film . There was a dulcet protest against her from the actresses present . Latecomers arrived . " Yevgeny , now what did you bring me ? " A door closed . " A late Happy New Year , John . " " Gloves ! How thoughtful . I shall wear these . " " Wear them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll give you a hundred thousand to sell . " The American 's name was John Osborne . His room at the Rossiyawas just off Red Square , most likely a real suite with cut flowers . The Ukraina was a railway station in comparison with the Rossiya . Osborne 's Russian was good and strangely suave . But Arkady wanted to hear the girl again . More voices rushed onto the tape. " ... wonderful per f ormance . " " Yes , I gave a reception for her when the whole ballet company came to New York . Dedicated to her art . " " With the Moiseyev ? " " Wonderful energy . " Arkady listened to more welcomes , toasts to Russian art , questionsabout the Kennedys ; there . was nothing more from Irma Asanova . He felt his eyelids grow heavy , as if he were an unseen guest buried beneath warm coats and the drone of half-heard words , fourmonth-oldechoes of a room and faces he 'd never seen . The flapping of tape in his earphones snapped him to attention . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the tape . The same party , later . Osborne speaking . " The Gorky Tannery already gives me ready-made gloves . Ten years ago I did try to import leather  --  calfskin I could undercut the Spanish and Italians with . Fortunately , I checked the goods in Leningrad . I 'd been given stomach linings . Tripe . I traced the shipment back to a cattle collective in Alma Alta , which had shipped on the same day my calfskins to Leningrad and soup tripe to Vogvozdino . " Vogvozdino ? But the American would n't know about the prison camp there , Arkady thought .

" The pages from the file on Osborne were onionskin , with the KGB seal embossed in red : John Dusen Osborne , citizen U.S.A. , born 16/5/2o in Tarrytown , New York , U.S.A. Non-Party member . Unmarried . Current residence , New York , N.Y . First entry to U.S.S.R. 1942 at Murmansk with LendLeaseadvisory group . Resided 1942  --  44 in Murmansk and Arkhangelsk on assignment from U.S. Foreign Service as transportation adviser , during which time the subject performed significant services to the anti-Fascist war effort .

The subject has sponsored many goodwill missions and cultural exchanges and is a yearly visitor to the U.S.S.R.The second page of the dossier mentioned offices of Osborne Fur Imports , Inc. , and Osborne Fur Creations , Inc. , in New York , Palm Springs and Paris , and listed Osborne 's visits to Russia over the past five years . His last trip had been from January 2 to February 2 . There was a penciled note crossed out , but Arkady could read : " Personal Reference : I. V. Mendel , Ministry of Trade . " The third page said : " See : Annals of Soviet-American Cooperationin the Great Patriotic War , Pravda , 1967 . " Also : " See : Department One . " Arkady recalled Mendel . The man was one of those lobsters who molted and grew fatter with each season , first as supervisor of " relocation " for kulaks , then wartime commissioner for the MurmanskRegion , next director of Disinformation for the KGB , and finally , his claws as great as dredges , deputy minister of Trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have more friends of the same species . " It 's your humility that makes you charming . A Russian feels inferior to anyone but an Arab or another Russian . " Russian giggles proved Osborne 's point . It was the worldly tone that seduced them . Anyway , he was a safe foreigner . " When in Russia , a wise man stays away from beautiful women , intellectuals and Jews . Or to put it more simply , Jews . " A sadistic pearl with the one necessary element , Arkady conceded : a grain of truth . Isis much amused audience was wrong , however . The dossier notation " Department One " stood for the KGB 's North AmericanBureau . Osborne was no agent ; no tapes would have been passed on if he were . Osborne , the notation meant , was simply cooperative , a patron of Russian arts and an informant on Russian artists . No doubt more than one dancer basking in his hospitality had uttered statements in New York that found a second audience in Moscow . Arkady was relieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tape . Misha had invited Arkady for supper . Before going , he checked on what his detectives had been up to . Fet 's Scandinavian tapes were stacked neatly by notepapers and two pencils sharpened to pinpoints . Pasha 's table was a mess . Arkady glanced at the detective 's transcripts of Golodkin 's telephone calls . One transcript made the day before was curious . Golodkin spoke nothing but English on this call , and whoever was on the other end spoke nothing but Russian : G : Good morning . This is Feodor . Remember , on your last trip we were going to go to the museum together . X : , qa . G : How do you do ? I want to show you the museum today . Is today convenient for you ? X : I'I3BHHHTe , O ' - IeHb 3M- MT . MOKeT , B CneAyloujnH pa3 . G : You are sure ? The transcribed Russian of the unidentified person was perfectly colloquial . It was a matter of faith , though , that no one could really speak Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary to the evidence , that he had to use English . Golodkinwas speaking to a foreigner . Arkady found the tape that matched the transcript and put it on the machine . This time he heard what he 'd read . " Good morning . This is Feodor . Remember , on your last trip we were going to go to the museum together . " " Yes . " " How do you do ? I want to show you the museum today . Is today convenient for you ? " " I 'm sorry , I 'm very busy . Maybe next year . " " You are sure ? " Click . Arkady recognized the other voice at once because he 'd listened to it for hours . It was Osborne . The American was back in Moscow . The Mikoyans had a large flat  --  five rooms including one with two grand pianos that Misha had inherited , along with the flat , from7 2 1p MOSCOW M 73his parents , who had performed as a team with the Radio Symphony Orchestra . The parents ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Misha and Natasha 's peasant wood carvings . Misha directed Arkady to the bathroom , one corner of which was occupied by a new clothes washer of immaculate white enamel . " The Siberia . Top of the line . A hundred fifty-five rubles . We waited ten months for this . " An extension cord led to an outlet , and a hose was draped over the side of the tub . Exactly what Zoya wanted . " We could have had the ZIV or the Riga in four months , but we wanted the best . " Misha picked up a copy of The Commercial Bulletin , which had been lying on the toilet . " Very highly rated . " " And not in the least bourgeois . " Maybe Schmidt had one in his seraglio . Misha gave Arkady a black look and handed him his glass . They were drinking peppered vodka and were already a little unsteady . Misha pulled a lump of wet underwear from the agitator tub and stuffed the clothes into the spin dryer . " I 'll show you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a roar , the machine began vibrating . The roar grew , as if a plane were taking off in the bathroom . Water spewed from the hose into the bathtub . Misha leaned back dreamily . " Fantastic ? " he shouted . " Poetry , " Arkady said . " Mayakovsky 's poetry , but still poetry . " The machine stopped . Misha checked the plug and the knob , which would n't turn . " Something the matter ? " Misha encompassed Arkady and the machine with a glare . He pounded its side , and the machine began vibrating again . " Definitely a Russian washer . " Arkady remembered an old verb which meant " to whip one 's serf " and wondered , sipping , if there would be a new one : " to whip one 's machine . " Misha stood with arms akimbo . " Anything new has a break-in period , " he explained . " It 's to be expected . " " It 's really rolling now . " Shaking , to be precise . Misha had crammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Arkady estimated , moving laundry from the agitator tub to the spin dryer and on to the communal clotheslines , a week 's wash could be done in . . . a week . Nevertheless , the machine was nearly lifting itself from the bathroom floor in its fervor . Misha took an anxious step back . The noise was deafening . The drainage hose popped off and water sprayed the wall . " What ! " Misha alertly crammed a towel against the drain hole with one hand and twisted the control knob with the other . When the knob came loose in his fingers , he fell to kicking the machine , which dodged his efforts until Arkady pulled the plug . " Fuck your mother ! " Misha kicked his stationary target . " Fuck your mother . Ten months "  --  he wheeled on Arkady  --  " ten months ! " He snatched up The Commercial Bulletin and tried to tear it in two . " I 'll show those bastards ! I wonder how much they got paid off ! " " What are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Misha threw the journal into the bathtub . At once he was on his knees ripping out the editorial page . " State quality label ? I 'll show you a quality label . " He rolled the page into a ball , threw it into the toilet bowl , pulled the flush chain and whooped triumphantly . " Now , how do you know who to write ? " " Sshh ! " Misha put a finger on his lips for silence . He took back his drink . " Do n't let Natasha hear you . She just got her machine . Act as if nothing happened . " Natasha served a supper of forcemeat patties , pickles , sausage and white bread , hardly touching her wine but sitting in an aura of contentment . " To your coffin , Arkasha . " Misha raised his glass . " Which will be lined with embroidered silk , have a satin pillow , your name and titles on a gold plate , and silver handles set in the finest cedar one hundred years old from a tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pleased with himself . " Or , " he added , " I could just order it from the Ministry of Light Industry . That should take about as long . " " I 'm sorry about the supper , " Natasha told Arkady . " If we had someone else to shop . . . you know . " " She thinks you 're going to pump her about Zoya . We refuse to i ; i t in the middle between you two , " Misha said , and turned to Na- ! . isha . " I lave you seen Zoya ? What did she say about Arkasha ? " " If we had a bigger refrigerator , " Natasha explained , " or oneIt 11 a freezer . " ' ' They talked about refrigerators , clearly . " Misha rolled his eyes74at Arkady . " Incidentally , you do n't happen to know any murdererrepairmenwho owe you a favor ? " Natasha cut her meat patty into small sections . " I know some doctors . " She smiled . Her knife stopped as her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plate . " A little problem , love , " Misha said . " The washer is n't quite working . " " That 's all right . We can still show it to people . " She seemed genuinely content. 6MAN WAS NOT born criminal but fell into error through unfortunate circumstances or the influence of negative elements . All crimes great and small could be traced to postcapitalist avarice , egoism , sloth , parasitism , drunkenness , religious prejudices or inherited depravity . The killer Tsypin , for example , was born of a killer and a gold speculator , whose forebears included killers , thieves and monks . Tsypin was brought up an urka , a professional criminal . He wore an urka 's blue tattoos  --  snakes , dragons , the names of assorted lovers  --  in such profusion that they curled out from under his shirt cuffs and collar . Once he 'd shown Arkady the red cock tattooed on his penis . Tsypin 's murder of an accomplice was , fortunately for him , coinmittedduring a time when only state crimes were deemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In camp he added another tattoo , " Fucked by the Party , " across his forehead . Again he was lucky . Such " corporal " anti-Soviet propaganda had been a state crime until a week before his act , so he merely got some skin added to his head from his ass and five years added to his sentence , a term suspended on the event of the hundredth anniversary of Lenin 's birth . " I take the long view now , " he told Arkady . " The crime rate goes up , it goes down . Judges loosen up , then they break your balls . Like the moon and the tide . Anyway , now I have a good situation . " Tsypin was a machinist . But he made his real money off truck drivers . Drivers would fill up their tanks to deliver goods to some village in the country . Just outside Moscow , however , they 'd siphon some gas , sell it at a cut rate to Tsypin , change their odometers and , at clay 's end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad roads and detours . Tsypin , in turn , sold the gas to private car owners . The authorities were aware of his activities , but as there were so few gas stations in Moscow and there was such pressure from car76 Am MOSCOW gi 77owners for more , profiteers such as Tsypin were covertly allowed to perform a needed social service . " The last thing anybody wants is a crackdown , and if I knew who killed three people in Gorky Park , I 'd be the first to tell you . In fact , whoever pulled something like that should have his balls cut off . We have standards too , you know . " More urkas took the chair in Arkady 's office at Novokuznetskaya , each repeating that no one was crazy enough to shoot anyone in Gorky Park and , from the other point of view , no one was missing . The last was Zharkov , a former Army man who traded in guns . " What 's available anyway ? Red Army issue , some rusty British revolvers , maybe a Czech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you might find a gang with a machine gun . Not here , nothing like you describe . Very well , who 's going to fire it ? Besides myself , I ca n't think of ten people in Moscow under the age of forty-five who could hit their grandmother at ten steps . They 've been in the service , you say ? This is n't America . If we 've been in any real wars for the past thirty years , do let me know . They do n't get a chance to shoot anyone , and besides , the training 's gone to the devil . Let 's be serious . You 're talking about an organized execution , and you and I know only one organization equipped for that . " In the afternoon , Arkady kept calling Zoya 's school until they told him she 'd left for the Union of Teachers athletic club . The club was a former mansion at the point of Novokuznetskaya just across from the Kremlin . Searching for the club 's gymnasium , he became lost until he went through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one time had been for musicians . He looked down at what had been a ballroom . Defaced cupids decorated the high ceiling . The dance floor was covered with vinyl tumbling mats , shiny and redolent of sweat . Zoya was swinging on the uneven bars . Her gold hair was pulled into a bun , and she wore sweat bands on her wrists and woolen leg warmers . When she rolled under the lower bar , her legs spread like the wings of a plane , the muscles of her back and rear scalloped under her leotard . In a sweatsuit , arms folded , Schmidt watched from the mats . She reached , thumbs to forefingers , for the upper bar , about-faced in a spin to swing down to the lower bar , grunting against wood , raised herself in a handstand with toes to the ceiling , and reversed and rolled , legs apart , back to the high bar . She was not good enough to be graceful ; what she had was a manic kind of momentum , like a clock 's wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bars , and when Schmidt caught her with both hands at her waist , Zoya put her arms around him . It was romantic , Arkady thought . Instead of a husband there should be a string quartet and moonlight . Natasha was right  --  they were made for each other . Leaving the balcony , Arkady slammed the door hard so it gave the report of a gun . He got fresh clothes from his apartment and , on his way to the Ukraina , Annals of Soviet-American Cooperation in the Great PatrioticWar from the Historical Library . Maybe the KGB would have carted off their cartons by the time he reached the hotel , Arkady thought , and maybe Pribluda would be waiting . The major might even start with a little joke , establishing a fresh , more amiable relationship , perhaps describing their current misunderstanding as purely institutional . After all , the KGB was maintained out of fear . Without enemies , outside or within , real or imagined , the whole KGB apparatus was pointless . The roles of the militia and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to demonstrate that all was well . Years hence , Arkady imagined , the three killings might be discussed in law journals as Institutional Goal Conflicts in Gorky Park . There were new cartons with the old ones at the Ukraina . Pasha and Fet were gone . Pasha had left a note saying the ikon angle was a bust , but that he did have a German on something else . Arkady crumpledthe note , flipped it into the wastebasket and dropped his clean clothes on the office cot . It was raining , drops hurtling down to the frozen river , steaming off the boulevard traffic . Through the rain , across the boulevard , in the foreigners ' compound , a woman in a nightgown stood at a lit window . American ? Arkady 's chest ached , the center swollen pink and tender where the fugitive in the park had hit him two nights before . Ile mashed out one cigarette and lit another . He felt strangely light  --  light of Zoya , light of home , slipping out of an orbit that had been his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman 's window went dark . he asked himself why he wanted to sleep with a woman he 'd never seen before and whose face was a blur behind a wet pane . He 'd never been unfaithful , never even thought about it . Now he wanted any woman . If not that , to hit someone . Make contact , that was the main thing. lie forced himself to sit and listen to the January tapes of the78 MOSCOW MI **25;8830;TOOLONG Osborne . If he could fashion any link be tween Gorky Park and such a KGB favorite , he was sure Major Pribluda would step in . There was no reason to suspect Osborne de spite the American 's contacts with Irina Asanova and the ikon dealer Golodkin . It was merely as if passing through a field one day Arkady had heard a hiss beneath a rock . Here lies a snake , said the hiss . The furrier had spent January and the first two days of February shuttling between Moscow and the annual fur auction in Leningrad . In both cities he fraternized with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and directors , dancers and actors , not with the sort of shabby citizens whose bodies had been found in Gorky Park . Osborne : You 're famous as a director of war films . You love war . Americans love war . It was an American general who said War is heaven . ' " In the Annals of Soviet-American Cooperation in the Great Patriotic War , Arkady found Osborne mentioned twice : During the siege , most foreign nationals vacated the port . One who did not was the American Foreign Service officer J. D. Osborne , who worked shoulder to shoulder with Soviet colleagues to minimize the destruction of goods on the docks . Throughout the most intense shelling , General Mendel and Osborne could be found on the out- skirts of the city laboring under fire to supervise the almost immediate repair of damaged tracks . The intent of Roosevelt 's so-called lend- lease policy was fourfold : to prolong the struggle between the Fascist aggressors and the defenders of the Soviet homeland until both corn- batants were drained of blood ; to delay opening a Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to place the fighting Soviet people in unending financial debt ; and to reestablish Angla American hegemony throughout the world . It was individual Ameri- cans who had the vision to strive for a new global relationship . . . . A few pages later : ... one such infiltration of Fascist raiders trapped the transportation group led by General Mendel and the American Osborne , who fought their way to safety using handguns . Arkady remembered his father 's jokes about Mendel 's physical cowardice ( " shitty pants , shiny boots " ) . Yet with Osborne , Mendel was a hero . Mendel had gone to the Ministry of Trade in 1947 , and shortly after , Osborne received a license for the export of furs . Detective Fet suddenly popped into the office . " I thought since you were here , Investigator , I might listen to more of my tapes , " he said . " It 's late . Wet out , Sergei ? " " Yes . " Fet laid his dry overcoat on a chair and sat down at a machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . The young man went through the motions of balancing his glasses on his knob of a nose and laying out his sharpened pencils . Probably there was a microphone in the office , and they 'd got fed up with listening to a man reading and listening on his own headset and ordered poor Fet into the breach . That showed real interest . Very good . Fet hesitated . " What is it , Sergei ? " Familiarity made Fet uncomfortable . The detective shifted like a small locomotive gathering steam . " This approach , Investigator  --  " " It 's after hours , call me Comrade . " " Thank you . This approach we 've taken  --  I ca n't help but wonderwhether it is the correct one . " " Me , too . We start out with three dead bodies , and go off on a tangent with tapes and transcripts of people who , after all , are welcomevisitors . We could be absolutely wrong , and all this could be a waste of time . Is that what you were thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath . " Yes , Chief Investigator . " " Please call me Comrade . After all , how can we link cooperative foreigners to this crime when we do n't know who the victims were or what they were really killed for ? " " That 's what I was thinking . " " Why not , rather than foreigners , choose a selection of ice-skate clerks , or amass the names of all the people who visited Gorky Park this winter ? Would that be better , do you think ? " " No . Maybe . " " You 're of two minds , Sergei . Please tell me , because criticism is constructive . It defines our purpose and leads to unanimity of effort . " The concept of ambiguity made Fet more uneasy , so Arkady helped . " Not of two minds . In mind of two different approaches . Is that better , Sergei ? " " Yes . " Fet started afresh : " And I was wondering whether you knew of some aspect in the investigation that I did n't , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of State Security ? " " Sergei , I have complete faith in you . I also have complete faith in the Russian murderer . He kills from passion and , if possible , in8o MOSCOW Siprivate . True , there is a housing shortage now , but as that situation improves there will be even more homicides in private . Anyway , can you imagine a Russian , a son of the Revolution , luring three persons in cold blood to an execution in Moscow 's foremost cultural park ? Can you , Sergei ? " " I do n't quite understand . " " Do n't you see , Sergei , there are elements of a joke in this murder ? " Fet straightened with revulsion . " A joke ? " " Think about it , Sergei . Put your mind to it . " Making excuses , Fet left a few minutes later . Arkady went back to Osborne 's tapes , using earphones , determined to finish the January reels before going to sleep on the cot . In the table lamp 's moon of light he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matches he drew an outline of the park clearing . Osborne : " But you ca n't do Camus 's The Stranger for a Soviet audience . A man takes the life of a total stranger for no reason but ennui ? It 's purely Western excess . Middle-class comfort leads inevitably to ennui and unmotivated murder . The police are used to it , but here in a progressivesocialist society no one is tainted by ennui . " " What about Crime and Punishment ? What about Raskol-nikov ? " " My very point . For all his existentialist rambling , even Raskolnikovjust wanted to get his hands on a few rubles . You 'd be as likely to find an unmotivated act here as you would be to find a tropical bird outside your window . There would be mass confusion . Camus 's murdererwould never be caught here . " Around midnight he remembered Pasha 's note . On the detective'stable was a report clipped to the dossier of a German national called Unmann . Arkady leafed through it with red eyes . Hans Frederick Unmann was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at nineteen , dismissed from the Young Communistsfor rowdyism ( criminal charges for assault dropped ) . Joined the Army in 1952 and , during the reactionary turmoil of the following year , accused of bludgeoning rioters ( charges of manslaughter dropped ) , then finished his service as a guard at the Marienbad stockade . Employed for four years as chauffeur to the secretary of the Central Committee for Trade Unions . Reinstated in Party in ' 63 , remarriedthe same year and employed as foreman in an optics factory . Five years later , dismissed from Party for beating his wife . hi short , abrute . Unmann was back in the Party and attached by Komsomol to maintain discipline among German students in Moscow . His photo showed a tall , bony man with sparse blond hair . Pasha 's report added that Golodkin had supplied prostitutes for Unmann until the German cnded the association in January . There was no mention of ikons . There was a reel on Pasha 's machine . Arkady jacked in Pasha 's earphones and turned the machine on . He wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January ? Arkady 's German was n't as good as it had been in the Army , but it served to decipher the outright physical threats that Unmann used to keep his students in line . From the sound of their voices , the German students were adequately terrified . Well , Unmann had a great job . One or two terrified kids a day , and the rest of his time to call his own . He 'd smuggle cameras and binoculars from Germany , and probablybullied the students into doing the same for him . Of course , no ikons ; only visitors from the West wanted Russian ikons . Then Arkady heard a tape of a caller telling Unmann to meet him " at the usual place . " A day later the same caller told Unmann to be outside the Bolshoi . The next day " the usual place , " and two days later somewhere else again . No names were used , no real conversation was held , and what conversation there was , was in German . It took a long time for Arkady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unmann had never appeared on the Osborne tapes . Osborne called Unmann , never the other way around , and Osborne apparently called only from pay phones . Then there would be a wrong intonation in the anonymous caller 's voice , and Arkady would think his identification was insane . He set up two machines and listened alternately to Osborne and Unmann tapes . He built an ashtray pyramid of butts . Now it was a matter of patience . At dawn , after seven hours of listening , Arkady walked outside the hotel to revive himself . Around the empty taxi stand , hedges crackledin the wind . As he gulped air he heard another sound , a rhythmic thud from far overhead . Workmen were tapping the parapets of the , Ukraina 's roof for the false notes of bricks loosened by the winter . Back in the room , he started on Unmann 's February tapes . On February 2 , the day of Osborne 's departure from Moscow to Leningrad , the anonymous man called . " The plane 's delayed . " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry too much . " 78a " You never do ? " " Relax , Hans . " " I do n't like it . " " It 's a little late to like or not like anything . " " Everyone knows about those new Tupolevs . " " A crash ? You think only Germans can build anything . " " Even a delay . When you get to Leningrad  --  " " I 've been to Leningrad before . I 've been there with Germans before . Everything will be fine . " For an hour Arkady slept . THE DUMMY WAS a featureless pink plaster head in a ratty wig , but it was hinged at the ears so that the face could split open down the middle and reveal an inner structure of blue muscles and a white skull as intricate as a Faberge egg . " Flesh does n't sit on a vacuum , " Andreev said . " Your features , dear Investigator , are not determined by intelligence , character or charm . " The anthropologist set the dummy aside and took Arkady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Twenty-seven bones in your hand . Investigator , each articulating in a different way for a definite purpose . " Andreev 's grip , strong for such a small man , tightened , and Arkady felt the veins shifting within the back of his hand . " And flexor muscles and extensor muscles , each with different sizes and attachments . If I told you I was going to reconstruct your hand , you would n't doubt me . The hand seems a tool , a machine . " Andreev let go . " The head is a machine for nervous response , eating , seeing , hearingand smelling  --  in that order . It is a machine with proportionately larger bones and less flesh than a hand . The face is only a thin mask of the skull . You can make the face from the skull , but you ca n't make the skull from the face . " " When ? " Arkady asked . " In a month  --  " " A few days . I have to have an identifiable face in a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have n't heard a word I said . I barely decided to do the face at all . The procedure is very complicated , and I 'm doing it in my spare time . " " There is a suspect who will be leaving Moscow in a week . " " Ile ca n't leave the country , so  --  " " Ile is . " " Ile 's not Russian ? " " No. " 84 " Ah ! " The dwarf 's laugh erupted . " Now I see . Do n't tell me any more about this , please . " Andreev climbed a stool and scratched his chin and looked up at the skylight . Arkady was afraid he would refuse to have anything more to do with the head . " Well , she did come to us largely intact except for the face and I took photographs of her , so I wo n't have to spend any time building the neck and jawline . The muscle attachments were still on the face , and we photographed and sketched those . We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get a cast from a clean skull , I suppose I could begin . " " When can you get a clean skull ? " " Investigator , such questions ! Why do n't you ask the cleaning committee ? " Andreev reached and pulled open a deep drawer . Inside was the box Arkady had brought the head in . Andreev knocked off the lid . Inside was a shiny mass , and it took Arkady a moment to see that the mass was moving and was composed of beetles , a mosaic of jewel-like insects feeding over and inside bright bone . " Soon , " Andreev promised . From the militia teletype room on Petrovka Street , Arkady sent out a new homicide bulletin , not just west of the Urals this time but all-republic , including Siberia . He continued to be disturbed by the fact that the three bodies were unidentified . Everyone had papers ; everyone watched everyone else . How could three people be missing for so long ? And the only connection to anyone was the ice skates of Irina Asanova , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Komsomolsk they 're ten hours ahead of Moscow , " the teletype operator said . " It 's night there already . We wo n't get an answer until tomorrow . " Arkady lit a cigarette and , with his first inhale , went into a coughing fit . It was the rain and his banged-up ribs . " You ought to see a doctor . " " Know a doctor . " He put a fist to his mouth and left . When Arkady arrived , Levin was in the autopsy room working over a body with maroon lips . Seeing him hesitate at the door , the pathologist wiped his hands and came out . " Suicide . Gas , plus cutting both wrists and the neck , " Levin said . " New joke . Secretary Brezhnev calls Premier Kosygin into his office and says , ' Aleksei , my dearest comrade and oldest friend , I have justMOSCOW a 85heard a disturbing rumor that you are Jewish . " But I 'm not , ' Premier Kosygin answers with shock . Secretary Brezhnev takes a cigarette from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Levin 's narrow head mimicked all this  --  " and says , Well , Aleksei , think about it . ' " " Old joke . " " New version . " " You 're fixated on Jews , " Arkady said . " I 'm fixated on Russians . " The chill of the basement sent Arkady into another coughing fit , and Levin relented . " Come with me . " They went up to Levin 's office , where , to Arkady 's amazement , the pathologist broke out a bottle of real cognac and two glasses . " Even for a chief investigator , you look awful . " " I need a pill . " " Renko the Hero Worker . Here . " The sugary cognac was soaked up by the mass alongside Arkady 's heart . Nothing seemed to reach his stomach . " How much weight have you lost recently ? " Levin asked . " How much sleep have you had ? " " You have pills . " " For fever , chills , runny nose ? For your work ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You do n't know fear when you have it ? Not the I Icro Worker . " Levin leaned forward . " Drop the case . " " I 'm trying to shift it . " " Not shift it . Drop it . " " Shut up . " Coughing again , Arkady set his glass down and bent over , holding his ribs . He felt Levin 's icy hand slip into his shirt and run over the tender swelling in the middle of his chest . Levin hissed . By the time Arkady 's fit was done Levin had moved to the chair behind his desk and was writing on a slip of paper . " This will inform the prosecutor 's office that you have a coagulatedmass resulting from contusions and hemorrhage of the chest cavity and need medical observation in case of pyrenemia and peritonitis , not to mention the possibility of a broken rib . Iamskoy will give you two weeks at a sanatorium . " Arkady took the slip and crumpled it.

" 86ro MOSCOW %la 87It was codeine . Arkady swallowed two pills and tucked the bottle into his coat . " How did you get that lovely bump ? " Levin asked . " Someone hit me . " " With a truncheon ? " " Just his fist , I think . " " That is someone for you to stay away from . Now , if you 'll excuse me , I 'll get back to a suicide that 's quick and clean . " After Levin left , Arkady stayed while the codeine spread like a salve through his veins . With one foot he maneuvered the wastebasket closer in case he threw up , then sat very still and thought about the corpse downstairs . Both wrists and the throat ? And gas ? Was that animal rage or philosophical thoroughness ? On the floor or in a tub ? Private tub or communal ? Just when he was certain he was going to be sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian kills himself ; that made sense . But , honestly , what would a Russian corpse have to do with a tourist ? Three corpses  --  that had a more wholesale , capitalist ring to it , but even so . . . When does a tourist even find time to gun down people ? For what Russian treasure worth stealing ? From another viewpoint , what threats could three poor workers make against a man who could simply get on a plane and fly away to America , Switzerland , the moon ? So why was he pursuing such a theory , let alone conceiving it ? To hand the case to the KGB ? To thumb his nose at the KGB ? Or , getting personal , to prove to someone that being a mere investigator actually amounted to something , perhaps even a hero , as Levin suggested ? Maybe that someone would leave Schmidt and come home ? Yes to all questions . There remained one more intriguing possibility : that the investigatorhimself had discovered  --  by accident , the way a man passes a mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the collar  --  how shabby his work was . Or worse , how pointless . Was he a chief investigator or a processor of the dead , an adjunct of the morgue , his paperwork the bureaucratic substitute for last rites ? A small point that , and merely indicative of socialist reality ( after all , only Lenin Lives ! ) . More important , careerwise , everyone was right . Unless he became a Party apparatchik , he 'd gone as far as he ever would . Here and no further . Was it possible  --  did he have the imagination  --  tocreate some elaborate case full of mysterious foreigners , black marketeers and informers , a whole population of fictitious vaporsrising off three corpses ? All of it a game of the investigator against himself ? ' I'hcrc was a certain plausibility to that . He fled the morgue for the rain , walking with his head pulled into his shoulders . At Dzerzhinsky Square crowds were running for the metro station . There was a stand-up cafeteria next to the children 's store across the square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stomach , and he was waiting for the traffic to pass when he heard his name called . " Over here ! " A figure came from under a low archway to pull Arkady out of the rain . It was Iamskoy , a blue trench coat over his prosecutor 's uniform , a gilded hat on his shaved head . " Comrade Justice , do you know our extremely talented Chief Investigator Renko ? " Iamskoy brought Arkady over to an old man . " Son of the general ? " The justice had little eyes set close to a sharp nose . " The same . " " Very pleased to meet you . " The justice gave Arkady a small , knobby hand . In spite of the justice 's reputation , Arkady was impressed . There were only twelve justices on the Supreme Court . " My pleasure . I was on my way to the office . " Arkady took a step back toward the street , but Iamskoy held on to his arm . " And you 've been working since before the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , " Iamskoy told the justice . " The most creative worker and the hardest worker . Do n't the two always go together ? Enough ! The poet lays down his pen , the killer lays down his ax , and even you , Investigator , must rest from time to time . Come with us . " " I have a lot of work to do , " Arkady protested . " You want to shame us ? I wo n't have it . " Iamskoy swept the justice along as well . The archway led to a covered passageway Arkady had never noticed before . Two militiamen wearing the insigniaof the Internal Security Division stood aside . " Besides , you do n't mind if I show you off a little , do you ? " The passageway led to a courtyard of gleaming Chaika limousines . More expansive with each stride , Iamskoy led the way through an iron door into a hall lit by crystal fixtures in the shape of white stars , down a carpeted stairway and into a wood-paneled room of narrow mahogany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and running the length of the room was a photograph of the Kremlin at night , a red flag twisting above the green cupola of the old Senate . Iamskoy stripped . His body was rosy , heavily muscled and , ex88 MOSCOW yZ ! 89cept for his crotch , nearly hairless . A mat of white hair covered the justice 's concave chest . Arkady followed their lead . Iamskoy looked casually at the black swelling on Arkady 's chest . " A little rough stuff , eh ? " He took a towel from his stall and tied it like a scarf around Arkady 's neck to hide the bruise . " There , now you look like a regular metropolitan . This is a private sort of club , so just follow me . Ready , Comrade Justice ? " The justice wore a towel around his waist ; Iamskoy draped his over his shoulder and pulled Arkady close , his arm around Arkady 's back , whispering with a jovial confidentiality that excluded the older man . " There are bathhouses and bathhouses . Sometimes an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't expect him to wait in line with the general public , not with a gut like the justice 's . " They passed through a tiled corridor ventilated by hot-air blowersand into a cellar vast enough to accommodate a long bathing pool of heated sulfurous water . Around the pool , within glazed Byzantine arches , swinging screens of carved wood partially hid alcoves furnished with short-legged Mongol tables and settees . Bathers sat in the steamy water at the far end of the pool . " Built during the distortions of the Cult of Personality , " Iamskoy said in Arkady 's ear . " The interrogators at the Lubyanka were workingaround the clock , and it was decided they should have somewhere to rest between prisoners . Water was pumped up from the undergroundstreams of the Neglinaya , steam-heated and mixed with salts . Just as the facility was completed , however , He died and the facility was abandoned . Lately the complete silliness of not using it became apparent . It has been "  --  he squeezed Arkady 's arm  --  " ' rehabilitated . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat perspiring at a table bearing silver bowls of caviar and salmon in crushed ice , plates of thinly sliced white bread , soft butter and lemons , mineral water and bottles of plain and flavored vodka . " Comrades First Secretary of the Prosecutor General and Academician , I want you to know Arkady Vasilevich Renko , investigatorin charge of Homicide . " " Son of the general . " The justice sat , ignored . Arkady shook hands over the table . The first secretary was big and hairy as an ape and the academician suffered from a resemblance to hhrushchcv , but the atmosphere was relaxed and amiable , the sameas in a film Arkady had once seen of the Czar Nicholas skinny-dipping with his General Staff . Iamskoy poured out spiced Pertsovka vodka  --  " pepper for the rain "  --  and heaped caviar on Arkady 's bread . Not pressed caviar but roe as big as ball bearings , the kind Arkady had n't seen in a store in years . He ate it in two bites . " Investigator Nikitin , you remember , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I warn you , " Iamskoy said in a soft mockery of his usual voice , " if you plan to do away with your wives , find another town . " Tufts of steam drifted off the pool and under the screen to taint the mouth with sulfur . Not unpleasantly , though  --  more like an edge to the vodka . A soul did n't have to travel for a cure , Arkady thought , just bathe below Dzerzhinsky Square where heroes were overweight . " White Dynamite from Siberia . " The first secretary refilled Arkady 's glass . " Straight alcohol . " The academician , Arkady gathered , was a member of this inner circle not for ordinary labors such as medical research but as an ideologist . " History shows us the necessity of facing west , " the academician said . " Marx proves the necessity of internationalism . That 's why we have to keep an eye on those bastards the Germans . The minute we take our eye off them they 'll get together again , take my word for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Russia , " the first secretary agreed strongly , " the Germans and the Czechs . " " Better ten murderers go free than one drug dealer , " the justice spoke up . Caviar speckled his chest . Iamskoy winked at Arkady . After all , the prosecutor 's office knew that it was Georgians who ran cannabis into Moscow and chemistrystudents at the university who concocted LSD . Arkady half listened as he ate dill-scented salmon , and all but closed his eyes in sleep as he relaxed on the settee . Iamskoy too seemed content to listen , arms folded ; he 'd yet to eat or more than sip his vodka ; the talk lapped around him like water around a rock . " Do n't you agree , Investigator ? " " Excuse me ? " Arkady had lost track of the conversation . " About Vronskyism ? " the first secretary asked . " That was before Arkady Vasilevich joined our office , " Iamskoy commented . Vronsky . Arkady remembered the name , an investigator for the Moscow Regional Office who 'd not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveillance of political activists . Naturally , Vronsky was no longer an investigator , and the mention of his name caused a queasiness in the judicial community . " Vronskyism " was a different kind of word , though , vaguer and more chilling , a breeze from a new direction . " What must be attacked , uprooted and destroyed , " the academicianexplained , " is , generally , the tendency to place legalisms above the interests of society , and , individually , the tendency among investigatorsto place their interpretation of the law above the understood goals of justice . " " Individualism is just another name for Vronskyism , " the first secretary said . " And self-centered intellectualism , " the academician said , " the kind that feeds itself on careerism and flatters itself with superficial success until even the basic , tacit interests of the greater structure are undermined . " " Because , " the first secretary said , " the solution to any particular crime  --  indeed , the laws themselves  --  are only the paper bunting on the concrete system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lawyers and investigators who confuse fancy with reality , " the academician said , " and when paper laws are smothering the work of the organs of justice , then it is time to pull down that bunting . " " And if a few Vronskyites fall as well , all the better , " the first secretary said to Arkady . " Would n't you agree ? " The first secretary leaned forward , knuckles on the table , and the academician turned his clown 's round belly toward Arkady , who watched Iamskoy 's sidelong gaze . The prosecutor must have known even as he called to Arkady on the street where the conversation in the bathhouse would lead . Iamskoy 's pale eyes said , Concentrate .. . take care . " Vronsky , " Arkady answered , " was n't he also a writer ? " " True , " the first secretary said , " a good point . " " A Yid , too , " the academician said . " Then "  --  Arkady draped salmon on a piece of bread  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigators who are also Jews and writers . " The first secretary 's eyes grew . He looked at the academician and Iamskoy , then back at Arkady . A grin built on his mouth , followed by the pistol report of a laugh . " Yes ! For a start ! " Defused , the talk fell to food , sports and sex , and after a fewminutes Iamskoy drew Arkady away for a stroll around the pool . More officials had arrived , floating like walruses in the heated water or moving as shades of white and pink behind the lattice of screens . " You 're feeling especially subtle today , confident enough to dodge the thrust . Good , I 'm pleased to see that . " Iamskoy patted Arkady 's back . " At any rate , the campaign against Vronskyism begins in a month . You are forewarned . " Arkady thought Iamskoy was steering him out of the bathhouse until the prosecutor led him into an alcove , where a young man was buttering slices of bread . " Look , you two must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renko 's father were famous friends . Yevgeny is with the Ministry of Trade , " Iamskoy told Arkady . Yevgeny tried to bow from a sitting position . He had a soft middle and a wispy mustache . He was younger , and Arkady vaguely remembered a pudgy boy who always seemed to be crying . " An expert on international trade "  --  Iamskoy made Yevgcny blush  --  " one of the new breed . " " My father  --  " Yevgeny started to say when Iamskoy abruptly excused himself , leaving them alone . " Yes ? " Arkady encouraged Yevgeny out of politeness . " A moment ? " Yevgeny pleaded . He concentrated on buttering the bread and adding dollops of caviar so that each slide resembled a sunflower with yellow petals and a black center . Arkady sat down and helped himself to a glass of champagne . " American companies in particular , " Yevgeny glanced up from his artwork . " Oh ? That must be a new field . " Arkady wondered when lainskoywould reappear . " No , not at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Armand Hammer , for example , was an associate of Lenin 's . Chemico built ammonia plants for us in the thirties . Ford made trucks for us in the thirties , and we thought we were going to work with them again but they made a mess of it . Chase Manhattan has been a correspondentof Vneshtorgbank since 1923 . " Most of the names were unknown to Arkady , but Ycvgcny 's voice was growing more familiar , though he could n't recall having seen him in years . " Good champagne . " I Ie put his glass down . " Soviet Sparkling . We 're going to export it . " Yevgeny looked up with a face full of childish pride. 92 3a MOSCOW LE 93Arkady felt the gate opening . Into the alcove stepped a man , middle-aged , tall , lean and so dark that at first Arkady believed he might be an Arab . Straight white hair and black eyes , a long nose and an almost feminine mouth made an extraordinary combination , equine and handsome . On the hand carrying his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that his skin was leathery , tanned rather than dark , tanned everywhere . " Absolutely gorgeous . " The man stood over the table , and water dripped off him onto the arranged bread . " Like perfectly wrapped presents . I wo n't dare eat one . " He regarded Arkady without curiosity . Even his eyebrows seemed groomed . His Russian was excellent , as Arkady had known , but the tapes had missed the quality of animal assurance . " Someone from your office ? " the man asked Yevgeny . " This is Arkady Renko . He 's ... well , I do n't know what . " " I 'm an investigator , " Arkady said . Yevgeny poured champagne and pushed the dish of canapes around the table , prattling as he did so . His guest sat down and smiled ; Arkady had never seen such brilliant teeth before . " What is it you investigate ? " " Homicides . " Osborne 's hair was more silver than white , and wet , it clung to his ears even after he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was marked . Osborne picked up a heavy gold watch and slipped it on his wrist . " Yevgeny , " he said , " I was expecting a call . Could you be an ange sur la terre and wait at the switchboard for me ? " From a chamois purse he took a cigarette and holder , joined them and lit the cigarette with a lighter of lapis lazuli and gold . The screen flapped behind the exiting Yevgeny . " You speak French ? " " No , " Arkady lied . " English ? " " No , " Arkady lied again . Arkady had seen people like this only in Western magazines , and he 'd always thought their gloss was a quality of the paper , not of themselves . The sheer physical smoothness was alien , intimidating . " It 's interesting that in all my other visits here this is my first encounter with an investigator . " " You never did anything wrong , Mr. . . . forgive mc , I do n't know your name . " " Osborne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name again ? " " Renko . " " You 're young to be an investigator , are n't you ? " " No . Your friend Yevgeny talked about champagne . Is that what you import ? " " Furs , " Osborne said . It would have been easy to say Osborne was more a collection of expensive items  --  ring , watch , profile , teeth  --  than a person ; it had the correct socialist attitude and in part it was true , but it did n't take into account what Arkady had n't expected , a sense of power under restraint . He himself was too stilted and inquisitorial . He had to change that . " I always wanted a fur hat , " Arkady said . " And to meet Americans . I hear they 're just like us  --  big-hearted and open . And to visit New York and the Empire State Building and Harlem . What a life you must lead traveling around the world . " " Not to Harlem . " " Excuse me . " Arkady stood . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to , and you 're too polite to ask mc to go . Smoking his cigarette , Osborne gave him a prolonged , noncommittalstare until Arkady started for the pool . " I insist you stay , " Osborne said quickly . " I do n't usually meet investigators . I should take advantage of this chance occasion and ask you about your work . " " Anything I can tell you . " Arkady sat . " Though from the accountsI read of New York anything I do will seem dull . Domestic troubles , hooligans . We have murders , but almost invariably they are committed in the heat of anger or under the influence of alcohol . " l lc shrugged apologetically and sipped champagne . " Very sweet . You really should import it . " Osborne poured more for Arkady . " Tell me about yourself . " " I could go on for hours , " Arkady said with zeal , and downed the champagne in a swallow . " Wonderful parents , as well as wonderfulgrandparents . In school I had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team of fellows with whom I work would each be worthy of a book to themselves . " " Do you "  --  Osborne removed his cigarette holder from his smile  --  " ever talk about your failures ? " 94 " Speaking personally , " Arkady said , " I 've never had a failure . " He loosened the towel from around his neck and dropped it on the towel Osborne had cast aside . The American looked at the discoloredswelling . " An accident , " Arkady said . " I 've tried hot-water bottles and heat lamps , but nothing is better than a sulfur bath for clearing up congestion . The doctors tell you a lot , but the old remedies are always the best . In fact , socialist criminology is the field where the greatest new advances are  --  " " Getting back to that , " Osborne cut in , " what has been your most interesting case ?

" Not that there 's been any story in the press "  --  Arkady puffed  --  " but I accept the fact that such a bizarre matter becomes grist for rumors . Particularly "  --  he wagged his finger as a teacher might at a naughty student  --  " among the foreign community , yes ? " He could n't tell whether he 'd made any effect . Osborne sat back without expression . " I had n't heard about it , " Osborne said when the silence grew too long . Yevgeny Mendel breezed in with the news that there were no phone calls . Arkady immediately rose and made profuse excuses for having overstayed his welcome , and thanked them for their hospitality and champagne . He picked up Osborne 's towel and knotted it around his neck . Osborne watched like a man far away and out of earshot until Arkady was at the screen . " Who is your superior ? Who is the chief investigator ? " " I am . " Arkady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps along the pool he felt exhausted . Suddenly Iamskoy was at his side . " I hope I was right about your father and Mendel 's being friends , " he said . " And do n't worry about Vronskyism too much . You have my unqualified support to pursue your investigations as only you can . " Arkady dressed and retraced his steps from the bathhouse to the street . ' 11w rain had become a mist . Iic walked up Petrovka StreetMOSCOW 3A 95to Colonel Lyudin 's warm forensic lab and delivered Osborne 's damp towel . " Your boys have been trying to get hold of you all afternoon , " Lyudin said before he took the towel off for examination . Arkady put a call in to the Ukraina . Pasha answered , and proudly told him that he and Fet were monitoring the black marketecr Golodkin 's phone , and had heard a man tell Golodkin to meet him in Gorky Park . Pasha believed the caller was American or Estonian . " American or Estonian ? " " I mean he spoke very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's a violation of privacy , Pasha , Articles 12 and 134 " " After all the tapes we 've been  --  " " Those were the KGB 's tapes !

" " All right . So you stayed at that end and Fet covered the meeting . He took a camera ? " Arkady asked . " That 's what took him so long , finding a camera . Because hemissed them . He walked all around the park and never found them . " " All right , at least we can use your tape and try to match  --  " " A tape ? " " Pasha , you broke the law to listen in on Golodkin 's phone and you were n't bothering to tape him ? " " Actually . . . no . " Arkady hung up . Colonel Lyudin clicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Investigator . I found ten hairs on the towel . I took one and cut it and put it under this microscope to compare it with a hair from the cap you found before , which is under this other microscope . The one from the cap is gray to white and has an ovoid cross section , which is indicative of curly hair . The new one from the towel has a color more like chrome , quite attractive , and has a perfectly round cross section , which indicates straight hair . I 'll go on with a protein analysis , but I can tell you right now these hairs are not from the same man . Look . " Arkady looked . Osborne was not the man who had said " Son of a bitch . " " Nice goods . " Lyudin fingered the towel . " You want it ? " The vodka and codeine were getting to Arkady and he went over96 a MOSCOW 1E 97to the militia commissary on Petrovka for a cup of coffee .

Some investigator , stealing a towel that exonerates his only suspect . He 'd go home if he had a home . " Chief Investigator Renko ? " asked an officer . " There 's a call for you in the teletype room , from Siberia . " " Already ? " The call was from a militia detective named Yakutsky in Ust- Kut , four thousand kilometers east of Moscow . In answer to the all- republic bulletin , Yakutsky reported that a Valerya Semionovna Davidova , age nineteen , resident of Ust-Kut , was wanted for the theft of state materials . Comrade Davidova was in the company of Kon- stantin Ilyich Borodin , age twenty-four , also wanted for the same crime . Arkady looked around for a map ; where in the world was Ust- Kut ? Borodin , Detective Yakutsky said , was a hooligan of the worst cloth . A fur trapper . A black marketeer in radio parts , which were in great demand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad construction , Borodin had a regular windfall of truck parts left in the open . When the militia had gone after him and the Davidova girl , the fugitives had simply disappeared . Yakutsky figured they either were holed up in some hut way off in the taiga or were dead . Ust-Kut . Arkady shook his head . No one ever got to Moscow from Ust-Kut , wherever it was . He wanted to let the Siberian detective down gently . We are all one republic , he thought . " Yakutsky " was one of the names slapped on every other Yakut native . Arkady pie- tured some canny Oriental face at a far-off phone . " Just where and when were they seen last ? " he asked . " Irkutsk in October . " " Did either the girl or the man have any training in restoring ikons ? " " If you grow up here you know how to carve . " The connection started to fade . " Well , " Arkady said quickly , " send me whatever pictures and information you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure . " " Konstantin Borodin is Kostia the Bandit . . . " The voice was faint . " Never heard of him . " " He 's famous in Siberia ... " Tsypin the killer greeted Arkady in a cell at Lefortovo . He wore no shirt , but his urka 's tattoos covered his body to his neck and to his wrists . He held up his beltless pants . " They took my shoelaces , too . Whoever heard of anyone hanginghimself with his shoelaces ? Well , they fucked me again . Yesterday I saw you and I was all set up . Today two guys come by on the highway and try to rob me . " " Where you were peddling gas ? " " Right . So what was I to do ? I hit one with a spanner and he drops dead . The other guy drives away just as a militia wagon pulls up , and I 'm standing there with the spanner in my hand and a dead guy at my feet . My God ! This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If I 'm lucky . " Tsypin sat down again on his stool . The cell also had a cot bolted to the wall and a pitcher for washing . His door had two panels , a small one for the guard to look through and a large one for food . " I ca n't do anything for you , " Arkady said . " I know , I ran out of luck this time . Sooner or later everyone does , right ? " Tsypin put on a better face . " But look , Investigator , I 've been a lot of help to you . When you really needed information I was the guy who helped you out . I never failed you because we had a mutual respect . " " I paid you . " Arkady softened what he said by giving Tsypin a cigarette and lighting it for him . " You know what I mean . " " I ca n't help you , you know that . It 's aggravated homicide . " " I was n't talking about me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an odd figure that had stayed in the background at a couple of meetings he 'd had with Tsypin . " Sure . " " We 've always been together , even in the camps . I 've always been the moneymaker , understand . Swan 's going to be hard up . I mean , I have enough on my mind , I do n't want to worry about him too . You need an informant . Swan has a telephone , even a car , he 'd be perfect for you . What do you say ? Give hint a try . " When Arkady left the prison , Swan was waiting at a streetlamp . I Ins leather jacket emphasized his narrow shoulders , long neck98and close-cropped hair . In camp a professional thief was likely to pick out an amateur convict , bugger him and then kick him out of bed . It made the thief , the one on top , more masculine . The " goat , " the one on the bottom , was detested as the queer . Yet Swan and Tsypin were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Swan a goat around Tsypin . " Your friend suggested you might do some work for me , " Arkady said without enthusiasm . " Then I 'll do it . " Swan had the strange delicacy of a chipped and shopworn figurine , all the more striking because he was n't handsome , let alone pretty . It was hard to guess his age , and his voice was too soft to be a clue . " There 's not much money in it  --  say , fifty rubles  --  if you come up with good information . " " Maybe you can do something for him instead of paying me . " Swan looked at the prison gate . " Where he 's going all he can get is one package a year . " " Fifteen packages , " Swan murmured , as if he were already wondering what to put in them . Unless Tsypin was shot right off , Arkady thought . Well , love was no fading violet ; love was a weed that flourished in the dark . Has anyone ever explained it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to the twenty-first century , Moscow maintained the Victorian habit of traveling on iron wheels . Kievsky Station , which was near the foreign ghetto and Brezhnev 's own apartment , pointed to the Ukraine . Belorussia Station , a short walk from the Kremlin , was where Stalin boarded the Czar 's train from Potsdam and , afterward , where Khrushchev and then Brezhnev boarded their special trains for Eastern Europe to inspect their satellites or to launch detente . Rizhsky Station took you to the Baltic states . Kursky Station suggested suntanned vacations on the Black Sea . From the small Savelovsky and Paveletsky stations no one worthwhile traveled  --  only commuters or hordes of farmers as dusty as potatoes . Most impressive. , by far were Leningrad , Yaroslavl and Kazan stations , the three giants of Komsomol Square , and the strangest of these was Kazan Station , whose Tartar tower capped a gateway that might take you thousands of kilometers to the deserts of Afghanistan , to the siding of a Ural prison camp , or all the way across two continents to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Station , entire Turkman families lay head to feet on benches . Babies with felt skullcaps nestled on soft bundles . Soldiers leaned slackly against the wall in a sleep so tangibly deep that the heroic mosaics of the ceiling overhead could have been their communal dream . Bronze fixtures glowed fully . At the one refreshmentstand open , a girl in a rabbit-skin coat confided in Pasha Pavlovich . " She says Golodkin used to shake her down , but not anymore , " Pasha reported when he returned to Arkady . " She says somebody saw him at the car market . " A young soldier took Pasha 's place with the girl . She smiled through a rouge of vascline and lipstick while the boy read the price chalked on the toe of her shoe ; then , hand in hand , they walked out100 K MOSCOW 101 the station 's main door as the investigator and detective trailed be- hind . Komsomol Square was blue before the dawn , the clicking candles of trams the only movement . Arkady watched the lovemakers slip into a taxi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . The driver would swing into the nearest side street and get out to watch for militia while the girl and boy went at it in the back seat . Of the five rubles the driver would get half and the chance to sell a congratulatory bottle of vodka to the soldier afterward ; the vodka was a lot more expensive than the girl . The girl would get some sips , too . Then a return to the station , a tip to the washroom attendant for a fast douche , and overheated and giddy , she 'd start all over . By definition prostitutes did not exist , because prostitution has been eliminated by the Revolution . Charges could be brought against them for spreading venereal disease , performing depraved acts or leading a nonproductive life , but by law there were no whores . " Not there , either . " Pasha returned from talking to the girls in Yaroslavl Station . " Let 's go . " Arkady threw his overcoat in the back of the car before getting behind the wheel . No frost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just lightening above the neon signs of the stations . A little more traffic . It would still be black in Leningrad . Some people preferred Leningrad , its canals and literary landmarks . To Arkady , it wore a perpetual sulk . He preferred Moscow , a big open machine . He headed south toward the river . " You ca n't remember any- thing else about that mysterious caller who met Golodkin in the park ? " " If I 'd gone instead . . . " Pasha muttered . " Fet could n't find the balls on a bull . " They watched for Golodkin 's car , a Toyota . Across the river , at the Rzhesky bathhouse , when they stopped for coffee and cakes , a fresh newspaper was being tacked to the public board .

I did n't know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now that explains you . " A crowd was already gathering a block away from the bath- house . At least half the people wore signs pinned to their coat . " rl'lirce-Room Apartment , Bed , Bath " was a woman with a widow 's stricken eyes . " Trade Four Rooms for 2 Two Rooms " was a newlyweddetermined to escape her parents . " Bed " was a shrewd junk dealer . Arkady and Pasha worked their way from each end of the block and met in the middle . " Sixty rubles for two rooms with indoor plumbing , " Pasha said . " That 's not bad . " " Any word of our boy ? " " Of course , it does n't have heat . No , Golodkin 's here some days , some days not . He makes himself a sort of go-between , you know , and takes thirty percent . " The used-car market was near the city limit , a long trip made longer because Pasha saw a truck selling pineapples . For four rubles he bought one the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he confided . " Some friends of mine , weight lifters , went down there . Fuck your mother ! Black girls , beaches and unprocessed foods . A worker 's paradise ! " The car market was a lot filled with Pobedas , Zhigulis , Moskvichesand Zaporozhets , some excruciatingly old but others with the aroma of the showroom . Once he had after years finally received the miniature Zaporozhets he 'd paid 3,000 rubles for , a sharp owner could drive it at once to the used-car lot , sell his toy for io , 000 , record a mere 5,000-ruble transaction at the government shed and pay a 7 percent commission , then turn around and spend his extra 6,650 rubles for a used but roomier Zhiguli sedan . The market was a beehive  --  theproviso being that each bee bring some honey of his own . Perhaps a thousand bees were on hand . A foursome of Army majors gathered around a Mercedes . Arkady ran his hand over a white Moskvich . " Like a thigh , eh ? " A Georgian in a leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're in love already . Take your time , walk around it . " " Really nice . " Arkady strolled to the back . " You 're a man who knows cars . " The Georgian placed a finger to his eye . " Thirty-thousand kilometers . Some people would have turned the mileage back , but I 'm not that way . Washed and polished every week . Did I show you the windshield wipers ? " He pulled them out of a paper bag . " Nice wipers . " " Practically new . Well , you can tell . " Iie turned his back to everyone but Arkady and penciled on the bag : " i 5,000. " 102 Arkady got into the car , sinking almost to the floor through the hollowed seat . The plastic wheel was as cracked as ivory from an elephants ' graveyard . He turned the ignition , and in the rear-view mirror watched a plume of black smoke rise . " Nice . " He got out . After all , a seat could be padded and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as diamonds . " I knew you 'd say that . Sold ? " " Where 's Golodkin ? " " Golodkin , Golodkin . " The Georgian racked his brains . Was it a person , a car ? He 'd never heard the name before , until the investiga- tor revealed an ID in one hand and the ignition keys still in the other . That Golodkin ! That bastard ! He 'd just left the lot . Arkady asked where he was headed . " The Melodya . When you see him , tell him an honest man like me pays commissions to the state , not to punks like him . In fact , for officials of the state , dear , dear Comrade , there is a discount . " On Kalinin Prospekt the smaller buildings were five-story rec- tangles of cement and glass . The larger buildings were twenty-five- story chevrons of cement and glass . Copies of Kalinin Prospekt could be found in any new city being erected , but none were quite so on the march to the future as Moscow 's prototype @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pedestrian underpass . Arkady and Pasha waited at an outdoor cafeteria across the street from the narrow build- ing that was the Melodya record store . " It 's a little more fun in the summertime . " Pasha shivered over a sundae of coffee ice cream and strawberry syrup . A bright-red Toyota came up the other side of Kalinin and turned onto a side street . A minute later Feodor Golodkin , wearing a sharply tailored coat , a lamb's-wool cap and cowboy boots and jeans , sauntered into the store as the investigator and detective were coming out of the underpass . Through the Melodya 's glass front they saw that Golodkin was not climbing the open stairs to the classical-music floor . Pasha stayed by the door as Arkady passed the kids flipping through the rock ' n ' roll . In the rear , between divider racks , Arkady spotted a gloved hand searching the political albums . Moving closer , he glimpsed nicotine- blond hair fashionably shaggy and a puffy face scarred at the mouth . A sales clerk came out of the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ' . Rrczhnev to the Twenty-fourth Party Congress . ' " Arkady read the album cover aloud as he stepped by Golodkin . " Piss off . " Golodkin elbowed Arkady , who took the elbow and bent it back so that Golodkin was forced to the toes of his boots . Three records slid out of the cover and rolled around Arkady 's feet . Kiss , The Rolling Stones , The Pointer Sisters . " One of the more interesting Congresses , " Arkady said . Golodkin 's eyes were set within red and heavy lids . For all his long hair and tailored suit , he put Arkady in mind of an eel twisting a hook first one way and then another . Taking him to the office at Novokuznetskayawas a combination of hooks . First , it officially placed Golodkinentirely in Arkady 's hands . No lawyer could be summoned until an investigation was finished , and not even the prosecutor need be informed of an arrest for forty-eight hours . Also , by bringing Golodkinwithin earshot of Chuchin , the implication was made that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his prime informer , or that Chuchin himself was in some kind of danger . " I was as surprised as you to see those records , " Golodkin protestedas Arkady led him into the first-floor interrogation room . " This is all a mistake . " " Relax , Feodor . " Arkady made himself comfortable on the other side of the table and put a stamped tin ashtray in front of the prisoner . " Have a smoke . " Golodkin opened a pack of Winstons and offered them around . " Myself , I prefer Russian cigarettes , " Arkady said amiably . " You 'll have a laugh when you find out what a mistake this all is , " Golodkin suggested . Pasha came into the room bearing a stack of papers . " My file ? " Golodkin demanded . " Now you 'll see that I 'm on your side . I have a long history of service . " " The phonograph records ? " Arkady asked . " Very well . Now I will be totally honest . That was part of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapped his fingertips . Pasha pulled out a charge sheet . " Ask anyone about me , they 'll tell you , " Golodkin said . " Citizen Feodor Golodkin , of Serafimov Two , City and Region of Moscow , ' " Pasha read , " you stand accused of hindering women from taking part in state and social activity , and of incitement of minors to crime . ' " 104 OiA nice way to describe procuring whores ; the sentence was four years . Golodkin brushed his hair back , the better to glare at the detective . " Ridiculous ! " " Wait . " Arkady lifted his hand . " You stand accused ' "  --  Pasha went on  --  " of receiving illegal commissions for the resale of private automobiles , of exploitation in the resale of living spaces , of selling for profit religious ikons . ' " " All of this is perfectly explainable , " Golodkin told Arkady . " You stand accused of leading a parasitical life , ' " Pasha read , and this time the eel twitched . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanded to includedissidents and all sorts of profiteers , and the sentence was nothing less than banishment to a woodshed rather closer to Mongolia than Moscow . Golodkin 's grin was small and sharp . " I deny everything . " " Citizen Golodkin , " Arkady reminded him , " you understand the penalties for failing to cooperate with an official inquiry . As you say , you are familiar with this office . " " I said  --  " He stopped to light one of his Winstons and , through the smoke , measured the stack of papers . Only Chuchin could have given them so much documentation . Chuchin ! " I was working for ... " He halted again despite Arkady 's inviting expression . Accusing anotherchief investigator was suicidal . " Whatever ... " " Yes ? " " Whatever I did , and I 'm not admitting I did anything , was on behalf of this office . " " Liar ! " Pasha flared up . " I should punch your lying face in . " " Only to ingratiate myself with real profiteers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " By murder ? " Pasha cocked his arm . " Murder ? " Golodkin 's eyes shot open . Pasha lunged across the table , just missing Golodkin 's throat . Arkady shouldered the detective back . Pasha 's face was dark with fury ; there were times when Arkady really enjoyed working with him . " I do n't know anything about any murder , " Golodkin blurted . " Why bother with an interrogation ? " Pasha asked Arkady . " All he does is lie . " " I have a right to talk , " Golodkin said to Arkady . " He 's right , " Arkady told Pasha . " As long as he can talk and tell the truth , you ca n't say he is n't cooperating . Now , Citizen Golodkin "  --  he switched on the tape recorder  --  " let 's begin with an honest and detailed account of your violation of women 's rights . " Purely as an unofficial service , Golodkin began , he had provided females he 'd believed of legal age to approved persons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , and for how much ? Arkady listened with half an ear while he read the reports from UstKutthat Golodkin had thought was his file . Compared with the petty crimes Golodkin was boasting about , the information supplied by DetectiveYakutsky was an adventure by Dumas . As an orphan in Irkutsk , Konstantin Borodin , called " Kostia the Bandit , " took apprentice courses in carpentry and engaged in restorationwork at the Znamiensky Monastery . Shortly afterward , he ran away from his state school and traveled with Yakut nomads to the Arctic Circle to hunt polar foxes . The militia first took notice of Kostia when a gang of his was caught trespassing on the Aldan gold fields along the Lena River . Before he was twenty , he was wanted for the theft of Aeroflot tickets , vandalism , sale of radio parts to young people whose " pirate " stations interfered with government transmissions , and old-fashioned highway robbery . Always he escaped into the Siberian taiga , where not even Detective Yakutsky 's helicopter patrols were able to find him . The only recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before by the Siberian newspaper Krasnoye Znamya . " If you want to know the truth , " Golodkin was telling Pasha , " the girls liked screwing foreigners . Nice hotels , good food , clean sheets  --  it 's a little like traveling themselves . " The newspaper photo was grainy and showed about thirty unidentifiedmen walking out of an undistinguished building . In the background , circled , surprised by the camera , a face recovered with a stare . It was heavy-boned and rakishly good-looking . There were still bandits in the world . Most of Russia was Siberia . The Russian language admitted only two Mongol words , taiga and tundra , and those two words expressed a world of endless forest or treeless horizons . Not even copters could find Kostia ? Could such a man die in Gorky Park ? " Have you heard of anyone selling gold in town ? " Arkady asked Golodkin . " Maybe Siberian gold ? " " I do n't trade in gold ; it 's too dangerous . There 's a bonus , you and I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a trader you boys can keep for yourselves . No , I 'd be insane to . Gold wouldn't1 o 6 a MOSCOW , C 107come from Siberia , anyway . It comes in with sailors , from India , Hong Kong . Moscow 's not a big market for gold . When you say gold or diamonds , you mean dealing with the Jews in Odessa or Georgians or Armenians . People with no class . I hope you do n't think I 'd ever be involved with them . " Golodkin 's skin , hair and coat reeked of American tobacco , Western cologne and Russian sweat . " Basically , I just do people a service . My particular expertise is in ikons . I go a hundred , two hun- dred kilometers out of Moscow , out into the sticks , into a little village , find out where the old men hang around and take a bottle . Look , these men are trying to stay alive on their pensions . Excuse me , but the pensions are a joke . I 'm doing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's been gathering dust for fifty years . Maybe the old women would rather starve and keep their ikons , but the men you can deal with . Then , I come back to Moscow and sell . " " How ? " Arkady asked . " Some taxi drivers and Intourist guides recommend me . But I can go right out on the street , I can spot the real buyers . Especially Swedes , or Americans from California . I speak English , that 's my strong point . Americans will pay anything . Fifty for an ikon you would n't pick up from the gutter , an ikon you would n't know whether you were looking at the front or back . A thousand for something big and fine . That 's dollars , not rubles . Dollars or tourist coupons , which can be just as good . How much does a bottle of really good vodka cost you ? Thirteen rubles ? With tourist coupons I can get that bottle for three rubles . I get four bottles to your one . I want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a favor , I 'm seriously going to offer him rubles ? Rubles are for suckers . If I offer a repairman a few bottles , I have a friend for life . Rubles are paper , see , and vodka is cash . " " Are you trying to bribe us ? " Pasha demanded indignantly . " No , no , my only point was that the foreigners I sell ikons to are smugglers , and I was assisting an official investigation . " " You sell to Russian citizens , too , " Arkady commented . " Only dissidents , " Golodkin protested . Detective Yakutsky 's report went on to say that during the 1949 campaign against Jewish " cosmopolites , " a Minsk rabbi named Solo- mon Davidov , a widower , was resettled in Irkutsk . Davidov 's only child , Valerya Davidova , quit her art studies after her father 's death a year ago to work as a sorter at the Fur Center in Irkutsk . Two photos were included . One was of the girl on an outing , eyes sparkling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the kind of felt boots called valenki . Very young , very gay . The other photo was from Krasnoye Znamya , captioned : " Pretty sorter V. Davidova holds up the pelt of a Barguzhinsky sable worth i , 000 R. on the international market for the admiration of visiting businessmen . " She was extraordinarilypretty , even in a dowdy uniform , and in the forefront of the admiring businessmen , his fingers brushing the sable , was Mr. John Osborne . Arkady turned back to the Kostia Borodin photo . With fresh eyes he saw that the group walking away from the circled bandit consisted of some twenty-odd Russians and Yakuts surrounding a small group of Westerners and Japanese , and this time he saw Osborne . By now , Golodkin was urgently explaining how certain Georgianshad monopolized the used-automobile market . " Thirsty ? " Arkady asked Pasha . " From listening to lies , " Pasha said . The windows had fogged over with perspiration . Golodkin watched one man and then the other . " Come on , it 's lunchtime anyway . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led Pasha to the door . " What about me ? " Golodkin asked . " You know better than to go , do n't you ? " Arkady said . " Besides , where would you go ? " They left him . A moment later Arkady opened the door to toss in a bottle of vodka . Golodkin caught it against his chest . " Concentrate on the murder , Feodor , " Arkady urged , and shut the door on Golodkin 's bewildered expression . Rain had washed away all the snow . Across tho street at the metro station , a line of men formed at a kiosk selling beer  --  " a true sign of spring , " according to Pasha  --  so he and Arkady bought pork sandwiches from a wagon as they queued up . They could see Golodkinwatching them through a smear on the window dew . " He 'll tell himself he 's too smart to take a drink , but he 'll think it over , say he 's doing all right and deserves a reward . Besides , if your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're a subtle bastard . " Pasha licked his lips . " About as subtle as a shove off a high place , " Arkady said . All the same , he was excited . Imagine , the American Osborne could have encountered the Siberian bandit and his lover . The bandit could have come to Moscow on stolen plane tickets . Remarkable. ro8 MOSCOW Kal 109Pasha bought the beers , two full glass mugs for forty-four kopeks , golden liquid warm and yeasty . The street corner filled up , more men in overcoats using the beer kiosk as an excuse to stand around . Without any grand squares or a building high enough to hang a bannerfrom , Novokuznetskaya had the air of a small town . The mayor and his planners had plowed Kalinin Prospekt through the old Arbat neighborhood to the west . The Kirov section to the east of the Kremlin would be the next to go , laid to rest under a new boulevard three times longer than Kalinin . But Novokuznetskaya , with its narrow streets and small shops , was the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer mugs greeted each other as if during the winter everyone had been invisible . At times like these , Arkady felt that a figure like Golodkin really was an aberration . The break over , Pasha went off to the Foreign Ministry for travel histories of Osborne and the German , Unmann , and to the Ministry of Trade for exterior photos of the Fur Center in Irkutsk . Arkady returnedalone to finish off Golodkin . " It 's no secret to you , I 'm sure , that I myself have participated in interrogations on the other side of the table , so to speak . I think we can speak honestly , you and I. I can promise you I will be as cooperativea witness for you as I was for others . Now , these things we discussedthis morning  --  " " Minor matters , Feodor , " Arkady said . Golodkin 's face flushed with hope . The vodka bottle stood half empty on the floor . " Sometimes sentences seem all out of proportion to the crime , " Arkady added , " especially for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special status . " " I think we 're going to work this out now that detective is gone . " Golodkin nodded . Arkady put a fresh tape on the recorder , offered a cigarette to Golodkin , who took it , and lit one for himself . The tape started spinning . " Feodor , I 'm going to tell you some things and show you some pictures ; then I want you to answer some questions . It may all sound perfectly ridiculous to you , but I want you to be patient and think carefully . Okay ? " " Go right ahead ! " ' ' Thanks , ' ' Arkady said ; inside he felt as if he were at the top of a long dive , the way he always did when he had to go by guesswork . " Feodor , it is established that you sell religious ikons to tourists , often Americans . This office has evidence that you tried to sell ikons to a foreign guest now in Moscow named John Osborne . You contacted him last year and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell through when Osborne decided to buy from another source . You 're a businessman of a sort yourself , and sales must have fallen through for you before . So what I want you to tell me is why you got so angry this time . " Golodkin looked blank . " The bodies in Gorky Park , Feodor . Do n't tell me you have n't even heard about them . " " Bodies ? " Golodkin could n't have been less fazed . " To be more precise , a man called Kostia Borodin and a young woman called Valerya Davidova , both Siberian . " " Never heard of them , " Golodkin answered helpfully . " Not by those names , of course . The point is that you were done out of a sale by them , that you were seen arguing with them , and that a few days later they were killed . " " What can I say ? " Golodkin shrugged . " It 's just as ridiculous as you said it would be . You said you had pictures ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murder victims . " Using both hands , Arkady laid out the pictures of Borodin and of Valerya Davidova sorting fur . Golodkin 's eyes were a marvel , dartingfrom the girl to Osborne , to the circled bandit to Osborne in the crowd , to Arkady and back to the pictures . " You begin to see how it looks , Feodor . Two people come from thousands of kilometers away and live here secretively for a month or two  --  hardly enough time to make enemies except for a business competitor . Then they are killed by someone sadistic , a social parasite . See , I 'm describing a very rare bird  --  a capitalist , you might say . You , in fact , and you are the bird in my hand . The pressures brought on an investigator to close out this sort of case are enormous . Another investigatorwould need nothing more . You were seen arguing with the victims . You were seen killing them ? That 's a very fine line . " Golodkin stared up at Arkady . Eel and eeler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the hook was coughed up . " If you killed them , Feodor , you will receive the death sentence for homicide aggravated by profit . If you perjure yourself , you 'll get ten years . If I as much as think you 're lying to me , I 'll send you away for all those minor matters we talked about before . The truth is , Feodor , you 're not going to have any special status in camp . The other convicts have very strong views about informers , especially unprotectedinformers . The truth is , Feodor , you ca n't afford to go to camp. 110 MOSCOW 1 1 1You 'll have your throat slit before the first month is out , and you know it . " Golodkin clamped his mouth shut , the hook deep in his guts now and not to be disgorged . He was landed and exhausted and losing color , all the vodka-courage gone . " I 'm your only hope , Feodor , your only chance . You must tell me everything about Osborne and the Siberians . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward until his foreheadrested on the table , as if his face were in the dirt . " Tell me , Feodor . " Golodkin wasted some time protesting his innocence , then began his tale , his head between his hands . " There 's a German , a guy named Unmann that I know . I used to get him girls . He said he had a friend who 'd pay a lot for ikons , and he introduced me at this party to Osborne . " Osborne did n't really want ikons . What he wanted was a church chair or a chest with religious panels . For a big chest , good quality , he promised me two thousand dollars . " I spend the whole fucking summer looking for a chest and finallyget one . Osborne shows up in December , just like he said . I call to give him the good news , and suddenly the prick gives me the brushoffand hangs up . I go right over to the Rossiya , just in time to see Osborne and Unmann coming out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with a pair of country bumpkins , the ones in your pictures . Unmann and Osborne split , and I follow the other two and talk to them . " There they are in the middle of Moscow reeking of turpentine . I know what 's up , and I tell them so . They 're fixing up their own chest to sell Osborne while I 'm left in the cold with mine . I had the deal first and I had expenses . Fair is fair , I want half of what they get  --  a commission , like . " The guy , this Siberian ape , puts his arm around me real friendly and suddenly there 's a knife at my neck . He puts this knife right through the collar of my coat to my throat in Sverdlov Square and says he does n't know what I 'm talking about , but he better not see me again and Osborne better not either . Can you believe it ? Sverdlov Square . It was the middle of January  --  I remember because it was the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleed to death and nobody would notice . Then the Siberian laughs and they just walk off . " " You did n't know they were dead ? " Arkady asked . " No ! " Golodkin picked his head up . " I never saw them again . You think I 'm crazy ? " " You got up the nerve to call Osborne as soon as you heard he was back in town . " " Just testing the water . I still have the chest , I ca n't sell it to anybody . You ca n't smuggle out a chest . The only customer was Osborne . I do n't know what he had in mind . " " But you met Osborne in Gorky Park yesterday , " Arkady tried . " That was n't Osborne . I do n't know who it was , he never gave me a name . Just some American who called and said he was interested in ikons , and I thought maybe I could still unload the chest . Or break it up and sell part . All he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You 're lying . " Arkady pressed . " I swear I 'm not . He was some fat old guy with stupid questions . He spoke great Russian , I 'll say that , but I 'm pretty much of an expert at spotting foreigners . So we walked through most of the park and stopped at a muddy field . " " On the north side of the park off the path ? " " Yeah . Anyway , I thought maybe he wanted some privacy to ask about a girl , having a party , understand , but he starts in about some exchange student , an American named Kirwill I 've never heard of . I only remember now because he kept asking . I told him , I meet a lot of people . That was it . The jerk walks off "  --  Golodkin snapped his fingers  --  " justlike that . Anyway , as soon as I saw him I knew he was n't serious about buying ikons . " " Why ? " " He was so fucking poor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describe what this Kirwill looked like ? " " Skinny , he said . Red hair . " Everything was coming Arkady 's way . Another American name . Osborne and a black marketeer . Two open sesames . He telephoned Major Pribluda . " I want information on an American with the last name of Kirwill . K-i-r-w-i-1-1 . " Pribluda took his time answering . " This sounds more like my business , " he finally said . " I agree absolutely , " Arkady said . A specific alien was under investigation . How could there be any doubt who should investigate him ? " No , " Pribluda said , " I 'll give you more rope . You send your Detective Fet around , I 'll give him whatever I have . " 1 1 2Naturally , Pribluda would release information only if it came with his own informant , Arkady knew . Good . He reached Fet at the Ukraina , then for an hour played with matches on a sheet of paper while Golodkin sipped from his bottle . Chuchin wandered into the interrogation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with another investigator . Arkady brusquely told the investigator for Special Cases that if he had any complaint , to take it up with the prosecutor , and Chuchin rushed out . Golodkin was impressed . Finally , Fet arrived bearing a briefcase and the air of a reluctantly invited guest . " Maybe the chief investigator would care to fill me in . " He adjustedhis steel-rimmed glasses . " Later . Take a seat . " If Pribluda wanted a report from Fet , then Arkady would give him a good one . Golodkin liked the rebuff of the detective , Arkady saw . He was getting his bearings , adjusting to a new loyalty . Arkady emptied the briefcase of photostats . There were more than he 'd expected . Pribluda was generous with what he called " rope .

In his second year a female faculty member attempted , at our directive , intimacy with the subject and was rejected . A male student was directed likewise without success .

On the other hand , he was the same age , same general physique , had the same steel molar and red hair , and knew Irma Asanova . Arkady showed the passport photo to Golodkin . " Recognize this man ?

" " You said "  --  Arkady took a second look for himself  --  " some fat old guy . " " Well , big , you know . " " His clothes again ? " " Russian , very ordinary . All new . The way he speaks Russian he could have bought the clothes himself , but , " Golodkin sneered , " why would anyone want to ? " " How exactly did you know he was n't Russian ? " Golodkin leaned forward , comrade to comrade . " I 've sort of made a study of it , spotting tourists on the street . Possible buyers , see . Now , your average Russian always walks with his weight sort of above his belt . Your American walks with his legs . " " Really ? " Arkady looked at the photo again . He did n't know much about American advertising ; he did see a face that expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the clearing where the bodies had been found and where Arkady had lost a fight . Arkady remembered biting his assailant 's ear . " You saw his ears ? " " I do n't think , " Golodkin mused , " that there 's any big differencebetween Russian ears and Western ears . " Arkady called Intourist , which told him that three nights before , when Arkady was being expertly beaten , the tourist W. Kirwill hadtickets for the Bolshoi . Arkady asked how to reach Kirwill 's Intourist guide . Kirwill was an individual tourist , he was told , and Intourist did not supply guides for groups of less than ten people . As Arkady hung up to face Fet 's limpetlike attention , Pasha re turned from his visit to the Foreign Ministry . " We now have a witness who links two probable victims directly to a foreign suspect "  --  Arkady phrased his remarks to his detectives grandiosely , the better for Fet to pass on to Pribluda . " It was ikons in a way , after all . It is unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to discuss this with the prosecutor . Our witness may even provide us with a second-hand link to the third victim in the park . See , boys , it 's starting to fit together . Feodor here is the key to everything . " " I said I was on your side , " Golodkin told Pasha . " What suspect ? " Fet could n't hold back . " The German , " Golodkin answered eagerly . " Unmann . " Arkady hustled Fet and the briefcase out the door . It was n't hard because at long last Pribluda 's canary had a song to sing . " Is it true about this Unmann ? " Pasha asked . " Close enough , " Arkady said . " Let 's see what you got . " The detective had brought all the Soviet itineraries for Osborne and Unmann for the last sixteen months , done in Ministry shorthand that made it seem as if they 'd been trapped in revolving doors : J. D. Osborne , President , Osborne Furs Inc . Entry : New York  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1o/1/76 ( Hotel Rossiya ) ; Irkutsk , 15/1/76 ( guest of Irkutsk Fur Center ) ; Moscow , 2o/r/76 ( Rossiya ) . Exit : Moscow  --  New York , 28/1/76 . Entry : New York  --  Moscow , 1r/7/76 ( Astoria ) . Exit : Moscow  --  New York , 22/7/76 . Entry : Paris  --  Grodno  --  Leningrad , 2/1/77 ( Astoria ) ; Moscow , 11/1/77 ( Rossiya ) . Interesting , Arkady thought . Grodno was a railway town on the Polish border . Instead of flying , Osborne had gone by train all the way to Leningrad . Exit : Moscow  --  Leningrad  --  Helsinki , 2/2/77 . Entry : New York  --  Moscow 3/4/77 ( Rossiya ) . Scheduled Exit : Moscow  --  Leningrad , 30/4/77. 1 I. Unmann , German Democratic Republic , C.P.G.D.R. Entry : Berlin-Moscow , 5/1/76 . Exit : Moscow  --  Berlin , 27/6/76. 116 MOSCOW LA 1 I7Entry : Berlin  --  Moscow , 4/7/76 . Exit : Moscow  --  Berlin , 3/8/76 . Entry : Berlin  --  Leningrad , 20/12/76 . Exit : Leningrad  --  Berlin , 3/2/77 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no information about Unmann 's interior travel in Russia , but Arkady figured that Osborne and the German could have been in immediate contact for thirteen days of January ' 76 in Moscow , for eleven days of July ' 76 in Moscow , then this winter with strenuous coincidence from January 2 through 10 in Leningrad , and from January 10 to February 1 in Moscow ( when the murders took place ) . On February z Osborne flew to Helsinki while Unmann seemed to have gone to Leningrad . They had now been in Moscow togethersince April 3 . Yet for the past twelve months , Osborne had called Unmann only by public phone . Pasha also produced a glossy photo of the Irkutsk Fur Center . It was the same drab modern building as in the photo of Kostia Borodin . Arkady would have been surprised if it was n't . " Drive our friend Feodor back to his place , " Arkady told Pasha . " There 's a special chest there I 'd like you to pick up and take to the Ukraina for safekeeping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took the reels of Golodkin 's confession off the machine . To make room for them in his pockets , Pasha had to shift his small , prized pineapple . " You should have got one , too , " he told Arkady . " It would be wasted . " " I 'll be available , Comrade Chief Investigator "  --  Golodkin put on his hat and coat  --  " just for you . " When they were gone and he was alone , Arkady felt the excitement in himself running like a motor . He 'd done it . This time , with Golodkin 's testimony and the threat of detention for one of the KGB 's favorite Americans , he could stuff the case down Pribluda 's throat . He put on his coat , went across the street and had a vodka , already regretting he had n't gone with Pasha so they could have shared a celebratory drink . " Here 's to us ! " They were n't such bad investigators , after all . He remembered the pineapple . Pasha obviously had other plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the pay phone . There just happened to be a two-kopek piece in his hand . He wondered where Zoya was . The Gorky Park investigation had been too strange . He 'd escaped , and now he was returning to routine . ' Hie pay phone wasballast , a connection to the total gravity that was Zoya . What if she 'd left Schmidt and gone back to the apartment ? He had n't been there in days , and had been moving around so much it would have been impossible for her to reach him . He should n't hide from her ; at least they should talk . He cursed himself for being weak , and dialed . The apartment phone was busy ; she was there . On the metro , everyone was going home from work . Arkady was one of them and he felt almost normal , with hardly any pain in his chest . Melodramas filled his head . Zoya was repentant and he was magnanimous . She was still angry but he was tolerant . She was in the apartment by sheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the variations in between , and all ending in bed . Yet he was n't excited . The melodramas were sodden , cheap and uninteresting ; he was only determined to act them out . He came off Taganskaya , through the courtyard , up the stairs two at a time and knocked on the door . The sound was hollow . he unlocked the door and entered . Zoya had been back , that much was clear . There were no chairs or tables , rugs or curtains , books or bookshelves , records or record player , china , glasses or eating utensils . She had made a diligent sweep , a combination annexation and purge . In the first of the two rooms she 'd left nothing but the refrigerator , and that was empty even of ice trays , which showed , he thought , a disappointing greed . In the second room the bed remained , so it was still a bedroom . He recalled how hard it had been to get the bed into the room . She 'd left only the sheets and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oddly bruised and empty , as if a burglar had crept not into the apartment but into him , and with dirty hands ripped out ten years of marriage . Or did she see it another way , her Caesarean birth out of him ? Had it been that bad all the time ? She was a good thief because now he did n't want to remember . The telephone receiver was off the hook , which was why he 'd thought she was home . He put the receiver back and sat beside the phone . What was happening to him ? He was hated by someone who had once loved him . If she 'd changed , he must have changed her . Him and his perfect record . Why did n't he become an inspector for the Central Committee , what was so wrong about that ? Become a shit and save his marriage . Who was he to be so pure ? Look at what he 'd just done , his fantasy about the black market and Siberians and Americans , one phony connection after another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; itl 119sake of justice , just to get those bodies from Gorky Park off his hands . Bluffing , squirming and dodging to keep his white hands clean . The phone rang . Zoya , he thought . " Yes ? " " Is this Chief Investigator Renko ? " " Yes . " " There 's been a shooting at an apartment at Serafimov Two . A man called Golodkin is dead , and Detective Pavlovich , too . " A trail of militiamen led from the entrance up the stairs to the second floor , through a hall of faces at cracked doors and into Golodkin'sapartment , two and a half rooms of cartons of scotch , cigarettes , records and canned foods heaped on a floor thick with Oriental carpetslaid one over the other . Levin was there fiddling with some instrumentsinside Golodkin 's head . Pasha Pavlovich was on the carpets , the back of his dark overcoat wet but not too wet ; he 'd died immediately . By his hand and by Golodkin 's lay separate guns . A borough investigator Arkady did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my guess , " he said , " well , it 's obvious that this Golodkin shot the detective in the back first , then the detective turned and , as he fell , killed Golodkin in return . The people in the other apartments did n't hear the shots , but the bullets would seem to be a match for the guns , the detective 's issue PM and Golodkin 's TK , though of course we 'll check that with ballistics analysis . " " The people in the other apartments , did they see anyone leave here ? " Arkady asked . " Nobody left . They killed each other . " Arkady looked at Levin , who looked away . " Detective Pavlovich was returning the other man here after an interrogation , " Arkady said . " Did you search the detective ? Did you find any tape-recorder reels ? " " We searched him . We did n't find any reels , " the borough investigatoranswered . " Have you removed anything from the apartment ? " " Nothing . " Arkady went through Golodkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panels , throwing armloads of parkas and skis out of the closets , cutting open cartons of French soaps while the borough investigator watched , rooted to one spot not just by anxiety that he 'd have to account for the damage but out of horror for an assault on such valuables . When Arkady finally returned to the deaddetective on the floor , the borough investigator ordered militiamen to start removing the goods . The shot that killed Golodkin left his forehead concave . Pasha seemed peaceful , eyes closed , his handsome Tartar face pressed into colored threads , a sleeping rider on a flying carpet . Golodkin 's chest was gone , the tapes were gone , Golodkin was dead . As Arkady went down to the street , the militiamen on the stairs were passing from hand to hand cartons of liquor , watches , clothes , a pineapple , skis , reminding him in spite of himself of ants laboring under crumbs . MOSCOW m 1219ALMOST ALL Russia is old , graded by glaciers that left a landscape of low hills , lakes and rivers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North of the city , Silver Lake was still frozen , and all the summer dachas on the lake were deserted , except Iamskoy 's . Arkady parked behind a Chaika limousine , went to the back door of the house and knocked . The prosecutor appeared at a window , motioned Arkady to wait and , five minutes later , emerged as the very picture of a boyar in a coat and boots trimmed with wolf fur . His bald head glowed pink with good health , and he set out immediatelyalong the beach . " It 's the weekend , " he said irritably . " What are you doing here ? " " You do n't have a phone here . " Arkady followed . " You do n't have the number . Stay here . " The ice was thick and dull at the center of the lake , fine and glassy at its edge . During the summer every cottage would have its family badminton game , bright parasols and pitcher of lemonade . Iamskoy had gone to a small shed about fifty meters from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pail of fishmeal pellets . " I forgot . You must have had a house up here when you were a boy , " Iamskoy said . " One summer , yes . " " I 'm sure , a family like yours . Blow this . " He handed the horn to Arkady . " Why ? " " Just blow , " Iamskoy ordered . Arkady put the cold mouthpiece to his lips and blew . A honk echoed across the ice . His second blast was louder , sounding again from the willows on the far side . Iamskoy took the horn back . " Too had about your detective . What was his name ? " " Pavlovich . " " Bad for you , too . If this profiteer Golodkin was so dangerous , you should have gone along and Pavlovich would still be alive . I 've been getting calls all morning from the prosecutor general and the commissioner of Militia ; they have my phone number out here . Do n't worry , I 'll protect you if that 's what you came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " Iamskoy sighed , " you would n't . Pavlovich was a friend of yours , was n't he ? You worked together before . " He looked away from Arkady to the sky , a white haze that blended into the silver birches . " Wonderful place , Investigator . You should come up here later in the year . There are some excellent shops that have opened for the residentssince you were a boy . We 'll go to them together and you can pick out something you want . Bring your wife . " " Pribluda killed him . " " Wait . " Iamskoy listened to a rustling from the trees right and left . Over the treetops rose strings of eiders , forming V 's as they gained height , the males white with black bellies and caps , the females gray . The geese circled the lake , their wings beating rapidly . " Pribluda had Pavlovich and Golodkin followed and killed . " " Why would Major Pribluda have any interest in this case ? " " The suspect is an American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you meet an American ? " Iamskoy began emptying thefishmeal pellets onto the ground . A deep cooing and whirring of wingsstirred the air . " You led me to him . " Arkady raised his voice . " At the bathhouse . You 've been following the case very closely , as you said . " " I led you to him ? That 's an enormous assumption . " Iamskoy poured the pellets in a wavy , decorative line . " I have infinite respect for your abilities , and make no mistake , I will help you any way I can , but do not assume I ' led ' you to anyone . I do n't even want to know his name . Sssh ! " He stopped Arkady 's answer and set the empty pail down . The eiders descended on a straight course , skidding in single file over the lake ice to a halt about thirty meters from the beach . There the birds directed a short-necked , suspicious glare at Iamskoy and Arkady until the men retreated toward the shed . Satisfied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ilandsome birds , are n't they ? " Iamskoy said . " Unusual for this122 ro MOSCOW M I 1 2 3area . They winter around Murmansk , you know . I had a regular colonyof them up there during the war . " More geese landed even while the leaders were stepping on shore , heads swiveling in search of danger . " Looking for foxes , always looking for foxes , " Iamskoy said . " You must have some very damning evidence to make you suspect an officer of the KGB . " " We have a tentative identification of two of the Gorky Park bodies . We had a tape on which Golodkin had positively identified those two people as dealing with the American . " " Do you have Golodkin now ? Do you have the tape ? " " It was stolen from Pasha 's body in Golodkin 's apartment . There was a chest , too , at Golodkin 's . " " A chest . Does that exist now ? Reading the borough investigator'sreport of property , I saw no mention of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to charge a major of the KGB on the basis of a missing tape and a chest and the testimony of a dead man ? Did Golodkin ever mention Major Pribluda ? " " No . " " Then I fail to understand what you 're talking about . I sympathize with you . You 're distraught over the death of a comrade . You have a personal dislike of Major Pribluda . But this is the wildest and least substantiated charge I 've ever heard . " " The American has ties to the KGB . " " So ? So do I , so do you . We all breathe air and we all piss water . All you 're telling me is that an American businessman is no fool . Frankly , how big a fool are you ? For your own sake I hope you have n't shared these irrational suspicions with anyone else . They had better not be in any report to my office  --  " " I want the investigation of Pasha 's murder under my personal direction , as part of the Gorky park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American you hint at has wealth , not merely money as you understand it , and a great many influential friends here  --  more even "  --  Iamskoy put it kindly  --  " than you . What could those three people in Gorky Park have that would have been worth a minute of his time , let alone make them worth killing ? A thousand rubles , a hundred thousand rubles may seem a lot to you , but not to a man like that . Sex ? With his influence he could cover the most bizarre embarrassment . What is left ? The fact is , nothing is left . You say you tentatively identified two of the bodies from the park . Were they Russian or foreign ? " " Russian . " " See , you 're getting somewhere . Russian , not foreign , nothing that concerns Pribluda or the KGB . As for Detective Pavlovicli 's death , he and Golodkin killed each other , it 's in the report . It seems to me that the borough investigator is doing an efficient job without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . But I will not let you interfere . I know you . First , you wanted to force this investigation onto Major Pribluda . Now that you think  --  for illogical and personal reasons  --  that he might be involved in the death of your colleague you 'll never give up the case , will you ? Once you get your teeth into a case you do n't let go . Let me be candid  --  any other prosecutor would put you on medical leave right now . I 'll compromise , I 'll let you continue on the Gorky Park victims , but I will be taking a much closer interest and control of the investigation from now on . And , maybe you should rest for a day or two . " " What if I just quit ? " " What if you do ? " " That 's just what I 'm doing . I resign . Get another senior investi gator . " The thought and words had come to Arkady at the same moment , as a man might realize simultaneously that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it , a door emitting light from the other side . It was so obvious . " I keep forgetting "  --  Iamskoy watched him  --  " that you have this irrational streak . I 've often wondered why you disdain your Party membership so openly . I 've wondered why you wanted to be an in-vestigator . " Arkady had to smile at the simplicity of the situation , and at the peculiar power it gave him . To simply exit ? What if in the middle of Hamlet , the prince decided the complications of the plot were too much , denied the ghost 's instructions , and sauntered off stage ; Arkady saw in Iamskoy 's eyes just that astonishment and fury at a play cut short . He 'd never had Iamskoy 's total attention before , yet Arkady continued to smile until the prosecutor drew his own chalky lips into a wide grin . " Well , let 's say you do quit , what happens ? " Iamskoy asked . " I could destroy you , but that would n't be necessary ; you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And your family . What kind of position do you think a chief investigator of Homicide gets after he quits ? Night watchman , if you 're fortunate . Not that you 'd be making me look eery good , either , but I can survive it . " 124 ro MOSCOW Oa 125 " So can I. " " So let 's talk about what happens to your investigation after you leave it , " Iamskoy said . " Another investigator will have to take over . yell , let 's say I have Chuchin take over . That does n't bother you ? " Arkady shrugged . " Chuchin 's not trained for homicide work , but that 's up to you . " " Good , that 's settled , Chuchin is your successor . A venal moron takes over your investigation and you approve . " " I do n't care about my investigation , I 'm quitting because  --  " " Because your friend is dead . For his sake . It would be hypocrisy not to . He was a good detective , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? " " Yes , " Arkady said . " Then quit , make your gesture , " Iamskoy said , " although I must agree with you that Chuchin is hardly the investigator you are . In fact , considering his lack of experience in homicide and the pressures for success in his first case , I would guess there is only one course of action he could take , and that would be to indict Golodkin for the murders in Gorky Park . Golodkin 's dead , the investigation would be wrapped up in a day or two . . . you see how it all fits together . But knowing the way Chuchin 's mind works , I suspect that wo n't be quite enough . He likes to put his stamp on things , to give the screw an extra turn . You know , I suspect he 's capable of naming your dead friend Pasha as Golodkin 's confederate . They died together in a shoot-out between thieves . Just to spite you ; after all , if it were n't for you , Chuchin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more I think about it , the more I 'm sure he 's going to do it . Speaking as a prosecutor , I 've always found it a fascinating aspect of human nature that with the same case different investigators will come up with different solutions . All perfectly acceptable . Excuse me . " There was no exit , after all . Arkady saw himself standing alone while Iamskoy retrieved his empty pail . Rather than take flight , the geese ran along the beach or onto the lake ice , finding a safe distance at which to coo disconsolately , eyes darting between Arkady and Iamskoy , resenting them equally . Iamskoy carried the pail pack to the shed . " Why do you care so much whether I stay on this case ? " Arkady joined him . " Histrionics aside , you 're the best homicide investigator I have . It 's my duty to keep you on the case . " Iamskoy was friendly again . " If the killer in Gorky Park was this American  --  " " Bring me the evidence and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said generously . " If it was this American , I only have nine days . He leaves May Day Eve . " " Maybe you 've made more progress than you know . " " Nine days . I 'll never get him . " " Do whatever you see fit , Investigator . You have great talents and I continue to have faith in the outcome of this matter . More than you , I have faith in the system . " Iamskoy opened the shed door to replace the pail . " Trust the system . " Before the door shut , Arkady saw in the dark of the shed two geese hanging by trussed feet , their necks wrung . The air was fetid with their ripening . Eiders were protected by law ; Arkady could n't understand why a man like Iamskoy would chance killing them . Ile looked back at the beach , which was crowded again with geese fightingfor their fair share of the prosecutor 's feed . Arkady returned to the Ukraina and started drinking before he noticed an envelope that had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and read the note inside , which said that both Pasha and Golodkin had died instantaneously from shots fired at a distance of no more than half a meter . Some shoot-out : one man killed from behind and the other in the forehead , their bodies found three meters apart . Levin had n't signed the note , which did n't surprise Arkady . Arkady was n't a big vodka drinker . Most men believed in vodka . There was a saying : " There are two kinds of vodka , good and very good . " Who followed Pasha and Golodkin to Serafimov 2 ? Who rapped on the door of that apartment and flashed the kind of identification that would satisfy Pasha and awe Golodkin ? There would have been two men , Arkady thought . One visitor would n't have been able to do everything fast enough , and three men would have put even the trustingPasha on his guard . Who then shot Pasha in the back , picked up his gun and killed the ever more deeply awed Golodkin ? Every answer was Pribluda . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect Osborne and hide Osborne 's connection to the KGB , and the only way he could do both was at a distance . As soon as Pribluda accepted the case , the KGB would he acknowledging that foreigners were involved . The foreign embassy  --  the American embassy , nothing126 , MOSCOW 127but spies  --  would become concerned and start its own inquiry . No , the investigation had to stay in the hands of the chief homicide investigatorof the prosecutor 's office , and it had to be unsuccessful . There were different ways not to get drunk . Some people relied on the bite of a pickle right after a swallow ; some trusted in mushrooms . Pasha had always said the trick was to get the alcohol straight to the stomach without breathing in . Arkady supposed that was what he was doing , doubled up and coughing . In some fashion Pasha and Zoya were linked . They were twin emblems of the chief investigator , his admiring colleague and his faithful wife . If there 'd been any temporary sense to her desertion , Pasha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientifically arrangedseries of muffled clappers , one swinging against the next and so on , out of Arkady 's reach now and beyond retrieval , but all set in motion by a fatal instability , a flaw . It was n't the system that was at fault . The system excused , even assumed , stupidity and drunkenness , sloth and deceit . Any system that did n't would n't be human , and this system was more human than any other . The instability was in a man who put himself above the system ; the flaw was in the chief investigator . Pasha 's notes were written in block print . Arkady saw , however , an effort to make them more scribbled , like his own . He knew he should get another detective to go through the rest of the German and Polish tapes and transcripts . Of course , there was Detective Fet to continue with the Scandinavian tapes , in between reports to Pribluda . There was a great deal of work left to be done , even if the investigator did nothing at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first place ? Who bravely threatened to arrest a foreign informant of the Committeefor State Security ? Who really killed Pasha ? Arkady threw a carton of tapes against a wall . He threw a second , splitting it open . A third , and then he scooped reels by the handful , releasing their long black tails in the air . " Down with Vronskyism ! " he shouted . The only undamaged carton was the one that had been delivered that day . There were all new tapes inside . Arkady found one for Osborne 's suite at the Rossiya that was only two days old . He would do his work . He would carry on . The first conversation on the reel was very short . Arkady listened to a knock , the sound of a door opening and Osborne 's greeting . " Hello . " " Where is Valerya ? " " Wait . I was about to take a walk . " The door closed . Arkady listened to it over and over because again he recognized the voice of the girl from Mosfilm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block long , of red letters standing as tall as a man : THE SOVIET UNION IS THE HOPE OF ALL MANKIND ! GLORY TO THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF THE SOVIET UNION ! Beyond the sign were the Likhachev works , where workers were " storming " to fill the special May Day quota of cars , tractors and refrigerators by slamming in screws with hammers , setting coolant coils with hammers , hand-making whole vehicles with hammers as the welder followed one step behind with his blessing torch , though all that could be seen from the sign outside was the impressively leaden smoke of the chimneys , each puff big as a boxcar and regularly dispatchedto the morning sky . Arkady led Swan to a cafeteria and gave him pictures of James Kirwill , Kostia the Bandit and Valerya Davidova . The morning drunks raised their heads from their tables . Swan 's black sweater made his neck and wrists seem all the more emaciated , and Arkady wondered how he would survive as an informant . Where workers drank , militiamen traveled in pairs . " It must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me ? " Arkady was surprised . " Being a man of feelings like you , I mean . " Arkady wondered if this was some sort of homosexual pass . " Just ask about those faces . " He threw some ruble notes on the table and left . Irina Asanova lived in the basement of an unfinished apartment house near the Hippodrome . As she came up the steps Arkady had the benefit of her full gaze and a look at the faint blue discoloration on her right check . ' I'hc mark was small enough to cover with powder ifshe wished ; uncovered , it added a lazuline edge to her dark eyes . I Icr patched coat flapped in the wind . " Where is Valerya ? " Arkady asked . " Valerya . . . who ? " She faltered . " You 're not the kind of citizen who reports her skates stolen to the militia , " he said . " You 're the kind who avoids the militia . You would n't report your skates stolen unless you were afraid they might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ? " " Lying . Who did you give your skates to ? " " I 'll miss my bus . " She tried to pass him . Arkady grabbed her hand , which was warm and soft . " Who is Valerya , then ? " " Where ? Who ? I know nothing , and neither do you . " She pulled free . On the way back , Arkady passed a rank of girls waiting for a bus . Compared with Irina Asanova they were as drab as cabbages . Arkady told a story to Yevgeny Mendel at the Ministry of ForeignTrade . " A few years ago , an American tourist was visiting the village he was born in about two hundred kilometers from Moscow when he dropped dead . It was summer and the local people did n't want to he disrespectful , so they stuck him in the refrigerator . You know these villages , they have only one refrigerator . They called here , and the people in the Foreign Ministry told them to do nothing more until they received special forms for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by , no forms . A week , no forms . These forms take time to or ganize . Two weeks went by , and the villagers got fed up with the tourist in the refrigerator . It was summer , after all . Milk was spoiling , and there was only so much they could fit on the American 's lap . Well , you know villagers  --  one night they got drunk , threw the body in a truck , drove all the way to Moscow , dumped the body in your lobby , jumped back in their truck and drove off . This is a true story . The commotion here was unbelievable . There was a ring of KGB officers around the body . At three in the morning they called an American attache from the embassy . The poor bastard thought he was going to have a private word with Gromyko , and instead here 's this body . I lc would n't touch it  --  not without the right forms . Still no one could find the right forms . Someone suggested there were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody wanted this American . Maybe130 Y1 MOSCOW 3LM 131they should just lose him , someone else suggested . Take him back to the village , bury him in Gorky Park , give him a job in the ministry . Finally , they called in me and the head pathologist . It turned out we had the right form , and we threw the American tourist in the trunk of the attache 's car . That was the last time I was in this building . " Yevgeny Mendel , who had been with Osborne at the bathhouse and who appeared so often on the Osborne tapes , knew nothing about James Kirwill or the bodies in Gorky Park , Arkady was sure . No special anxiety or intelligence had stirred Mendel 's soft face during the story . " What was the correct form for an American tourist ? " Mendel asked . " In the end , they settled for a death certificate . " Yet Yevgeny Mendel was troubled . He knew now that Arkady was an investigator , and while he would n't have been bothered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general population , he knew that Arkady was from that magic circle of Moscow children of " the High Ranks , " a creation of the same special schools and mutualacquaintances , and someone from that circle should be more than a chief investigator . Mendel , the fool of that circle , had an English suit , a silver pen beside the Party pin in his lapel , a large office high over Smolenskaya Square with three phones and a brass sable emblem of Soyuzpushnina , the agency for fur exports , on the wall . Somehow this chief investigator had fallen , and the social implications brought a sweat to Mendel 's chin like water beads on good butter . Arkady used this reaction . He mentioned the great friendship between their fathers , praised the valuable labor of Yevgeny Mendel 's father behind the lines during the war , and insinuated that the old brute was a coward . " He was decorated for bravery , though , " Yevgeny protested . " I can show you the papers , I 'll send them to you . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you met the other day , is n't that a coincidence ! The two of them were attacked by a whole squad of Germans . My father and Osborne killed three Fascists and drove the rest away . " " Osborne ? An American furrier at the siege of Leningrad ? " " He 's a furrier now . He buys Russian furs and imports them to America . He buys one here for four hundred dollars and sells it there for six hundred . That 's capitalism ; you have to admire it . He 's a friend of the Soviet Union , that 's been proven . May I speak out of school ? " " Absolutely , " Arkady said encouragingly . Yevgeny was n't vicious ; he was nervous . He wanted the investigatorto go away , but not until the investigator had a high opinion of him . " The American fur market is in the grip of international Zionist interests , " he said softly . " Jews , you mean , " Arkady said . " International Jews . I regret to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soyuzpushnina close to those interests . My father hoped to break this relationship by reserving for certain non-Zionists especially competitive prices . Somehow the Zionists got wind of it , flooded the Fur Palace with their money and took the entire sable harvest . " " Osborne was one of the non-Zionists ? " " To be sure . That was about ten years ago . " From Mendel 's window the river ice showed dark fractures . Arkady lit a cigarette and dropped the match in a wastebasket . " How did Osborne prove himself a friend of the Soviet Union , besides fighting heroically with your father at Leningrad ? " " I should n't tell you this . " " You might as well . " " Well "  --  Mendel followed Arkady with an ashtray  --  " a couple of years ago there was a trade between Soyuzpushnina and the Americanfur ranchers . That 's what they call it  --  ranching . Like cowboys . It was a trade of the very best fur-bearing animals . Two American minks for two Russian sables . Beautiful minks  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sables were more beautiful ; nothing can compare with Russian sable . However , they had one minor de-fect . " " Tell me . " " They were neutered . Well , it 's illegal to export fertile sables from the Soviet Union . They should n't have expected us to break our own law . The American ranchers were upset . In fact , they even organized a plan to infiltrate a man into Russia , steal some sables from a collective and smuggle them out . It took a true friend to inform us about his own countrymen . " " Osborne . " " Osborne . We showed our gratitude by telling the Zionists that from then on an equitable share of the Russian sable market was going to Osborne . For services rendered . " " The plane 's delayed . " " It 's delayed ? " 1 3 2 MOSCOW %la 1 33 " Everything is going fine . You worry too much . " " You never do ? " " Relax , Hans . " " I do n't like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not like anything . " " Everyone knows about those new Tupolevs . " " A crash ? You think only Germans can build anything . " " Even a delay . When you get to Leningrad  --  " " I 've been to Leningrad before . I 've been there with Germans before . Everything will be fine . " Arkady looked at the date on the reel again : February z . Osbornewas speaking to Unmann on the day of Osborne 's departure from Moscow to Helsinki . Arkady remembered Unmann 's itinerary ; the German had gone to Leningrad on the same day , apparently not on the same plane . " I 've been to Leningrad before . I 've been there with Germans before . Everything will be fine . " How , Arkady wondered , had Osborne killed the three Germans in Leningrad ? Listening to the new Osborne tapes , Arkady recognized the voice of Yevgeny Mendel . " John , you will be the ministry 's guest for Swan Lake on May Day Eve , yes ? You know it 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We will have you driven immediately to the airport . " " I would be honored . Tell me all about what it will be like . " There was a change from winter to spring . The winter Osborne had been maliciously entertaining ; the spring Osborne was an agreeablebore , a business dullard . Arkady heard monotonous toasts endlesslyrepeated , an endless conversation becoming longer and duller . Yet after hours of listening , he felt a watchfulness on the tapes . Osbornewas hiding among the endless words like a man standing sidewaysamong trees . Arkady thought of Pasha . " A peasant goes to Paris "  --  Pasha had told a joke while they were riding around looking for Golodkin  --  " and when he comes back all his friends get together to welcome him home . Boris , ' they say , tell us about your trip . ' Boris shakes his head and says , Oh , the Louvre , the paintings , fuck your mother . ' The Eiffel Tower ? ' somebody asks . Boris stretches his hand as high as it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Notre Dame ? ' somebody else asks . Boris bursts intotears remembering such beauty and says , Fuck your mother ! ' ' Ah , Boris , ' everybody sighs , what wonderful memories you have . ' " Arkady wondered how Pasha would describe heaven . Revolution Square used to be Resurrection Square . The Metro pole Hotel used to be the Grand . Arkady turned on the lights . The bedspread and curtains were of the same threadbare red muslin . A Persian carpet had a pattern indecipherablefrom wear . Table , bureau and stand-up closet were mottled by dents and cigarette burns . " This is allowed ? " The floor lady was anxious . " It is allowed , " Arkady said and shut the door on her to be alone in the room of the tourist William Kirwill . He looked down at the square , at the Intourist buses lined up from the Lenin Museum to the hotel entrance and the tourists boarding in linguistically divided herds for evenings of ballet and opera . According to Intourist , Kirwill was booked for **28;8857;TOOLONG . Arkady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the one demand of the Western traveler . Arkady took the bath towels to the bedroom , where he wrapped them around the phone and covered them with pillows . William Kirwill 's bureau revealed American underwear , stockings , sweaters and shirts , but none of the Russian clothes Golodkin had described . There were no clothes hidden under the bed . In the closet was a locked aluminum-and-vinyl suitcase . Arkady carried it to the bed and tried to jimmy the lock open with his penknife . The latch did n't move . He put the suitcase on the floor and stamped on the lock while lie worked the knife . Half the latch sprung . He hammered the knife into the other side of the lock , sprung it open , put the suitcase back on the bed and went through the contents . There were four small books  --  A Concise History of Russian Art , A Tourist 's Guide to Russia , A Guide to the Tretyakov Gallery and Nagel 's Moscow and Environs  --  held together by a thick rubber band . By itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two cartons of Camel cigarettes . A Minolta 35-mm. camera fitted on a hand grip ; also a 10-inch-long focus lens , filters and ten unopened boxes of film . Traveler 's checks to the amount of $i , 800 . ' Three rolls of toilet paper . A metal tube with a threaded cap on one end and a grooved plunger on the other that pushed up an artist 's razor-bladed knife . Used socks rolled into a ball . A small case shut tight with thick rubber bands ; inside the case , a gold pen-and-pencil set . A pad ofr34 ro MOSCOW 31A 135graph paper . A plastic bag containing a can opener , a bottle opener , a corkscrew and a thin , flat metal bar bent at one end and doglegged at the other with a screw through the bar above the dogleg . A book of Intourist dining coupons . No Russian clothes . Arkady went through the suits hanging in the closet ; nothing but American goods . He looked behind and under all the furniture . Finallyhe returned to the broken suitcase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could go buy some new luggage , somethingnice in cardboard . Arkady took the rubber band off the guidebooksand flipped through them . He picked up the Schulthess tome of color photographs , a bulky item for a light traveler . In the center , between a two-page spread of a horse festival in Alma Alta , was a loose graph paper keyed five feet to one inch . Drawn precisely were trees , footpaths , the edge of the river , a clearing and , in the middle of the clearing , three graves . Except for the difference between meters and feet , it was almost an exact rendition of the militia base-line drawing of the clearing in Gorky Park . Between the following two pages of the book he found a drawing of the whole park scaled at twenty feet to one inch . He also found a tracing of an X-ray of a right leg ; a shadow marked a compound fracture of the shin , the same fracture as on the third body from the park . A dental chart and a tracing of dental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no steel molar . Arkady looked at the rest of the contents of the suitcase with a different eye . The metal tube that held the artist 's knife was curious ; what did a businessman plan to cut in Moscow ? He unscrewed the cap of the tube and , with the plunger at the other end of the tube , pushed up the knife , which appeared unused . There was a faint odor from the tube . The odor was gunpowder . Looking down the hole , he could just make out the sharp point of the inside of the plunger . The tube was a gun barrel . In Moscow , guns were hard to come by , and the most improbableweapons were concocted . One gang made shotguns out of exhaustpipes . Now that he knew what he was looking for , the investigator was in his element ; he was angry that he had n't seen it all immediately . For apparently so devoted a photographer , this tourist took no pictures at all . Arkady removed the camera from the wooden hand grip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the tube fit into snugly . Only an inch of the barrel protruded from the front , and theplunger at the rear . On the left side of the grip was a screw hole . For a moment Arkady was stumped . Then he broke open the plastic bag , dumped out the openers and corkscrew , and picked up the odd-shaped metal bar he 'd noticed before . The main shaft was ten centimeters long , the right angle at one end about three centimeters , the dogleg at the other end about four centimeters . With his thumbnail he twisted its screw into the hole of the grip , leaving enough play for the bar to move . Now the dogleg was a trigger , and the right angle at the other end sat firmly on the barrel plunger , preventing it from sliding forward . He pulled the trigger ; the right angle rose and the plunger was free . He set it again , and wrapped one of the heavy rubber bands twice from the front of the grip to the back of the plunger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hidden ? Arkady opened the pen and pencil case . It was a matched set , fourteen-karat gold , impervious to X-rays . He pulled off their caps ; there were two .22 bullets in the pencil cap and one in the pen cap . Using the long handle of the artist 's knife , he stuffed a round into the barrel until it set tight against where the plunger 's needle point would slap forward . Too loud ; he 'd heard hardly any report when he was fired at under the tram bridge . Somewhere was a silencer . Hidden in a box of film ? Too short . He ripped open the American toilet paper . Inside the third roll , instead of a cardboard cylinder was one of black plastic , ringed by gas vents , with a threaded protrusion at one end . In all , a clumsy one-shot firearm inaccurate beyond five meters . Closer than that , adequate . Arkady was threading the silencer onto the barrel when the door opened . He aimed the barrel at William Kirwill . Kirwill shut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken suitcase , the muffled phone , the gun . The quick blue eyes were the giveaway  --  otherwise he looked like any brute : a florid face of small , clean features , a body of beef still hard at close to fifty , heavy arms and legs . At first impression a soldier , at second impression an officer . Arkady knew this was the man with the fists from Gorky Park . Kirwill looked back , weary but alert , his raincoat open to a pink sport shirt . " Came back early . " Kirwill spoke in English . " It 's raining again , in case you had n't noticed . " He removed a short-brimmed hat to shake the water off . " No , " Arkady spoke in Russian . ' Throw the hat here . " Kirwill shrugged . The hat landed at Arkady 's feet . With one hand Arkady searched the sweatband. 136 MOSCOW 30 137 " Take off your coat and drop it on the floor , " Arkady said . " Pull your pockets all the way out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raincoat fall to the floor , then emptying his pants pockets front and back , dropping his room key , loose change and wallet onto the coat . " Push it to me with your foot , " Arkady said . " Do n't kick it . " " All alone , are n't you ? " Kirwill said . He said it in Russian , very easily , while he nudged the raincoat over the floor . Five meters was the effective range of the gun ; a meter , Arkady felt , was the effective range of Kirwill . He waved Kirwill back to a point in between , and pulled the coat the rest of the way . The cuffs of Kirwill 's shirt were rolled back from heavy wrists , which showed freckles and red hair going white . " Do n't move , " Arkady ordered . " It 's my room , why should I move ? " Kirwill 's passport and visa were in the raincoat . In the wallet Arkady found three plastic credit cards , a New York driver 's license and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American embassy and two American news services . Also eight hundred rubles in cash , a lot of money . " Where 's your business card ? " Arkady asked . " I 'm traveling for pleasure . I 'm having a wonderful time . " " Face the wall . Put your hands up and spread your legs , " Arkady said . Kirwill very slowly did so , and Arkady shoved him from the back at an angle against the wall , then felt his shirt and pants . The man was built like a bear . Arkady backed up . " Turn around and remove your shoes . " Kirwill took his shoes off , watching Arkady and the gun . " Shall I hand them to you or mail them ? " Kirwill asked . Incredible , Arkady thought . The man was actually ready to attacka Soviet investigator again in a room at the Metropole . " Sit down . " Arkady pointed to a chair beside the closet . He could see Kirwill gauging the chances of a rush . Investigators were issued guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried his and had n't fired a gun since the Army . Shoot for the head or the heart ? A .22 anywhere else would n't even slow a man like Kirwill . Finally Kirwill sat in the chair . Arkady knelt and examined the shoes , finding nothing . Kirwill shifted , his heavyweight 's shoulders leaning forward . " Just curious , " he said when the gun barrel jerked toward him . " I 'm a tourist , and tourists are supposed to be curious . " Arkady threw the shoes to Kirwill . " Put them back on , and tie the laces of the shoes together . " When Kirwill was done , Arkady approached and kicked the chair , tilting it and the man against the wall . For the first time since Kirwill had entered the room , Arkady felt reasonably safe . " Now what ? " Kirwill asked . " You pile the furniture on me to hold me down ? " " If need be . " " Well , you might need to . " Kirwill assumed an air of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful men , a vanity as if their strength had no limits . The hate in the blue gaze , though , Arkady did n't understand . " Mr. Kirwill , you are guilty of violating Article 15 , smuggling a weapon into the Soviet Union , and Article 218 , manufacturing a dangerousweapon . " " You manufactured it , not me . " " You 've been moving around Moscow dressed as a Russian . You talked to a man called Golodkin . Why ? " " You tell me . " " Because James Kirwill is dead , " Arkady said to shock Kirwill . " You ought to know , Renko , " Kirwill answered . " You killed him . " " Me ? " " Are n't you the guy I punched around in the park the other night ? You 're from the prosecutor 's office , right ? Did n't you send a man to follow me and Golodkin when I went back to the park ? Little guy with glasses . I followed him from the park to a KGB office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head lolled to one side . " How do you know my name ? " Arkady asked . " I talked to the embassy . I talked to the correspondents . I read every back issue of Pravda . I talked to the people on the street . I watched your morgue . I watched the prosecutor 's office . When I found out your name I watched your apartment . I did n't see you , but I saw your wife and her boyfriend clean the place out . I was outside your office when you let Golodkin go . " Arkady did n't believe what he was hearing . This madman could not have watched him , followed Fet to Prihluda 's office , seen Zoya . When he and Pasha queued for a beer at the corner kiosk , was Kirwill in the line behind them ? 138ro MOSCOW 7M7 139 " Why did you choose this time to come to Moscow ? " " I had to come sometime . Spring 's a good time , time for bodies to come up from the bottom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think I killed James Kirwill ? " " Maybe not you yourself , but you and your friends . Does it matter who pulled the trigger ? " " How do you know he was shot ? " " In the clearing in the park , the depth of the digging . For slugs , right ? Anyway , you do n't stab three people to death . I wish I 'd known it was you in the park , Renko . I 'd have killed you . " Kirwill spoke with regret and some amusement for his missed opportunity . His Russian had no accent , yet retained a distinctly American voice . He folded his arms as if he were laying them aside . An outsized man of intelligence exerts a force of gravity , a threat of physical absorption , especially in a small room . Arkady sat down on a night table against the opposite wall . How could he have not noticed someone like Kirwill ? " You came to Moscow to ask questions among the foreign communityabout a murder , " Arkady said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must have meant to aid the investigation . " " If you were a real investigator . " " There is a record of James Kirwill leaving the Soviet Union last year ; there is no record of him returning . Why did you think he was here , and why did you think he was dead ? " " But you 're not a real investigator . Your detectives spend as much time with the KGB as they do with you . " There was no way of explaining Fet to an American , and Arkady did n't try . " How are you and James Kirwill related ? " " You tell me . " " Mr. Kirwill , I operate under the directive of the Moscow town prosecutor , no one else . I am investigating the murder of three personsin Gorky Park . You came all the way from New York with information that might be of help . Give it to me . " " No . " " You 're not in a position to say no . You 've been seen dressed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already fired at me . You 're withholding information and that , too , is a crime . " " Renko , you find any Russian clothes here ? Anyway , it 's a crime to dress like you ? As for the gun , or whatever you 're aiming at me , I never saw it before . You broke into my suitcase ; I do n't know what you planted in it . And what information are you talking about ? " Arkady was stopped for a moment by such massive contempt for the law . " Your statements about James Kirwill  --  " he began again . " What statements ? The microphone is in the telephone , andyou 've taken care of that . You should have brought some friendsalong , Renko . As an investigator you 're not too competent . " " There are your drawings of the murder scene in Gorky Parkand the X-rays and dental chart you brought , which will connect you to James Kirwill if he was one of the victims . " " The drawings and chart are done by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There are no X-rays , only tracings . What you should be thinking about right now , Renko , is what the American embassy is going to say about a Russian cop who assaultsinnocent American tourists when he 's caught "  --  Kirwill glanced at the open suitcase  --  " apparently in the act of burglary . You did n't plan to take anything , did you ? " " Mr. Kirwill , if you report anything to your embassy they will put you on the next plane home . You did n't come here to go right home , did you ? You also do n't want to spend fifteen years in a Soviet rehabilitation center . " " I can handle it . " " Mr. Kirwill , how is it that you speak Russian so well ? Where have I heard your name before , before you and this James Kirwill ? It seems to me now it 's a familiar name . " Good-bye , Renko . Go back to your friends in the secret police now . " " Tell me about James Kirwill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On his way he put Kirwill 's passport , wallet and credit cards on the night table . " Do n't bother , " Kirwill said , " I 'll clean up after you . " The wallet was heavy in the palm , and stiff even without credit cards . There was handstitching along one lip of the wallet . Kirwill rocked forward . Arkady waved the gun . A spy ? Arkady thought . Something as ridiculous as a secret message sewn into a wallet and a heroic roundup of traitors and foreign agents with a chief investigator bumbling around in the middle ? He ripped the stitching open , keeping one eye on Kirwill . From the wallet he drew a gold metal shield embossed in blue with the figures of an Indian and a pilgrim . " City of New York " was above the scale and " Lieutenant " below it . " A policeman ? "
