Are these the Cleavers or the Bunkers , this family of four preparing for an ordinary Thanksgiving in 1973 ? There 's Dad ( Carroll O'Connor ) , screwing himself into his easy chair , deflecting harsh words and harder responsibilities . Mom ( Frances Sternhagen ) is patrolling the house in her robe and bunny snood , calling " Wakey uppy ! Wakey uppy ! " in the tinny cascades of Texas motherhood . Sis ( Linda Cook ) is chatting on the phone with her boyfriend and threatening to " devote my entire life to crisis counseling for the holiday-impaired . My mother can be the poster child . " And young Jeremy ( Christopher Fields ) , just back from the war , slouches about like a lost soul . On closer inspection , though , this engaging sitcom quartet reveals affinities to more tortured theatrical families : O'Neill 's Tyrones , Miller 's Lomans , the ravaging couples in Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? Jeremy really has lost his soul , lost it for good and all , in the jungles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny and harrowing play takes place in a Dallas suburb on the tenth anniversary of John F. Kennedy 's assassination . The coincidence of dates sends Home Front aloft toward political metaphor . Dad may be every " reasonable " statesman who led the U.S. deeper into Viet Nam ; Mom and Sis could be every uncommitted American woman , worried sick about her boy or her beau , but hoping against all evidence for the best . And Jeremy may not be kidding when he says that in Viet Nam " I died . " Alive or dead , he is the twisted ghost of every Camelot ideal . This good boy went off to war ; now he has returned , the hunter haunted , to turn Thanksgiving dinner into a deathday party for all domestic illusions . <P> In its final , fatal moments , Home Front goes as berserk as Jeremy , waving a handgun of political didacticism at the audience , turning the American homestead into a Freudian minefield . Here Jeremy is less the middle class 's guilty secret than , in his sister 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must expose himself as a paranoiac patriarch whose home is his castle , moated by ignorance . For the two hours preceding this pirouette into psychodrama , Home Front is fiercely sympathetic to all of its characters . Beneath Mom 's lyrical ditsiness and Dad 's clumsy evasions are two frightened people who care , beyond words , for their son . But because Jeremy 's rage is beyond their comprehension , they can only stand by , then stand firm , as the boy plays out his nightmare . <P> Home Front was first staged last June in London , starring Sternhagen and under the direction of Michael Attenborough . Both repeat their roles in the excellent Broadway production that opened last week . One might expect O'Connor ( as a milder Archie Bunker ) or Fields ( in a part that cries out for an actor with the implosive intensity of a Sean Penn ) to commandeer the spotlight . But Home Front is Sternhagen 's show , allowing her to nail down , with an increasingly desperate comic urgency , the suburban matriarch .

" It 's a holiday ! " And on holiday , Sternhagen 's trill ascends to a wail , and she practically flutters into orbit over her brood .
