What began in 1935 as a temporary pension program for widows , then ballooned into an income-maintenance program for millions of unemployed women with children , may now become a job program that would enable people to get off the dole altogether . By a vote of 93 to 3 , the Senate agreed last week to revamp the nation 's welfare laws in the hope of breaking the cycle of dependency on government support . " It 's the first major change since the 1930s , " said New York 's Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan , the architect of the bill , " and it redefines the notion of welfare . " <P> The idea behind the landmark measure is to get people off relief by getting them into jobs . The bill requires that states provide job training , education and work for able-bodied welfare recipients , except those with children under the age of three . ( States have the option of lowering that limit to age one . ) To ensure the transition from handouts to breadwinning , states would have to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year after the parent gets a job . <P> The bill remedies one much criticized aspect of the present federal program : that two-parent families can not receive benefits . The new measure extends benefits to families in which both parents are unemployed ; no longer will there be an incentive for a father to leave the home . In fact , the incentives will go the other way : the bill will get delinquent fathers to pay their fair share of child support by requiring employers to deduct support payments from their wages . <P> The Senate bill is a companion to a House bill passed last December . The $7 billion House measure is more expensive and less stringent , and it provides greater benefits . Differences between the two must now be resolved by a House- Senate conference committee . The White House prefers the sterner Senate version . To avoid a potential presidential veto , a last-minute amendment was added to the Senate bill that requires one adult in two-parent welfare families to devote at least 16 hours a week to " workfare , " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already struck a compromise whereby 22% of those receiving benefits must have jobs or be enrolled in education or training programs by 1994 . Says Moynihan : " If it works by the turn of the century , we will have a different social landscape . "
