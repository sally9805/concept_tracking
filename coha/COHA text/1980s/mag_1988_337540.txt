It was n't pretty . The challenger 's advertising vilified the Vice President as a feckless aristocrat while touting himself as a man of the people . The Vice President 's campaign was quick to retaliate , depicting his opponent as a reckless enemy of the Constitution . The riposte must have worked , because the Vice President edged out his rival in the voting . <P> John Adams ' victory over Thomas Jefferson in the presidential election of 1796 might not have been due to Adams ' strident handbills , but it gave birth to a tradition in American politics that still flourishes : accentuating the negative . The rule is : when in doubt , attack ; when attacked , counterattack . History will show that in New Hampshire last week a Vice President 's hard- hitting , negative television ads in response to an insurgent Senator 's first strike pushed the Vice President to victory . On the Democratic side , two rivals strafed each other over the airwaves and basically reached a draw . <P> Although negative political ads are as old as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ads reappear , while candidates employ euphemisms to avoid using the N word . Television has made the strategy riskier . Because of the medium 's power and unpredictable effects , candidates have been reluctant to use the small screen for political sallies . But the flurry of so-called comparative ads during last week 's primary showed that restraint has been cast aside . The tone and character of much of the TV advertising for the rest of the primaries may be tough , accusatory , even mean . <P> In New Hampshire , it was Dole , not Bush , who launched the first strike . Several days after Iowa , the Dole campaign aired a slick , well-made ad featuring joint head shots of the Senator and the Vice President . The announcer listed areas in which Dole claimed that he had shown leadership  --  Social Security , INF , tax cuts  --  and then said in a stentorian voice , " George Bush had nothing to do with it . " Each time , Bush 's image faded a little more , until it finally vanished . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tracking polls showed Bush trailing Dole by as much as 9 points . Roger Ailes , Bush 's media consultant , advocated the use of negative ads to derail Dole . Bush hesitated . But on Saturday morning he agreed to run the ad some dubbed the " Two Faces of Dole . " Over head shots of Bush and Dole , an announcer praised Bush 's leadership on various questions , then declared that Dole had " straddled " the issues . <P> The ads were ready to go Saturday afternoon , But the state 's only commercial VHF station , Channel 9 , had closed for the weekend . New Hampshire Governor John Sununu , a Bush supporter , drove to Manchester to meet with the station manager , his friend ; within hours Bush 's ads were flickering across TV screens . From Saturday afternoon until the polls closed , the ad ran more than 40 times in the state . It was too late for Dole to come up with a reply . <P> Bush 's ad looked amateurish , but it had bite because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " George Bush wo n't raise taxes , period , " the ad said . " Bob Dole straddled , and he just wo n't promise not to raise taxes . And you know what that means . " The commercial cost Dole votes in the taxophobic state .
