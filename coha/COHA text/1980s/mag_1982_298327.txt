All in the family <P> Tennessee 's Fourth Congressional District is brand new , and so are the candidates . But it is old family ties that dominate the electoral showdown between Republican Cynthia ( " Cissy " ) Baker , daughter of Senate Majority Leader Howard H. Baker Jr. , and Democrat James Cooper , son of former Tennessee Governor Prentice Cooper . <P> " I want to be known as Cissy Baker , not as Howard Baker 's daughter , " protested Baker , 26 , before her Aug. 5 primary victory . To prove it she pointedly asked her father to stay out of her campaign . " It just about killed him to sit on the sidelines for a year , " she says . But after her rancorous primary contest that split Tennessee Republicans , Baker permitted the family 's heaviest hitter to go to bat for her . Says she , a bit defensively : " Dad is helping every other Republican running for office in this state . " <P> To familiarize herself with the Fourth District , Baker has spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the home of a different family each night . Before going into politics , she worked as an editor in Washington for the Cable News Network . " I know how Washington works , " she says , " and which doors to open for the people of the Fourth District . " <P> Cooper , 28 , a preppie-looking graduate of Groton and Harvard , can not match Baker 's family clout . Only elderly constituents remember his father , who in 1938 snatched the Governor 's seat from Baker 's grandfather Howard Sr. ( " This is Round 2 , " quipped an aide to the majority leader ) , went on to serve three terms and died in 1969 . The former Rhodes scholar has countered Baker 's hard work with a little shoe leather of his own-literally . Since his campaign began in July 1981 , Cooper has worn out three pairs of walking shoes and logged 63,000 miles in his car crisscrossing the district . <P> The Baker name works magic with campaign contributors . As of June 30 , Cissy Baker had a cache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raisers , including one at which her father was host . At the same point in his campaign , Cooper had $258,700 . Both scions benefit from strong national party support . Former President Gerald R. Ford will drop into Tennessee on Baker 's behalf ; former Vice President Walter Mondale will stump for Cooper . <P> The rural and conservative Fourth District was carved out last year by the Democrat-controlled state legislature after the 1980 census gave the state its ninth congressional seat . With unemployment in the district at 16% , both candidates have urged federal steps to create jobs in the region . Both assail government-funded abortions and decry gun control . Admits Baker : " I think my opponent and I agree on about all the issues . " <P> With an 18-point lead in the polls and 53% of the voters Democratic , Cooper should be optimistic . But , as his primary opponent Buddy Perry , now working for Cooper 's election , has counseled him , " You 're running against Howard Baker as much as against Cissy Baker . " <P> Competing cures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
