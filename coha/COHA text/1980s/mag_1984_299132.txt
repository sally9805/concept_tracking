Woman Veep <P> To the Editors : <P> In response to those who are asking , " Is the nation ready for a woman Vice President ? " NATION , June 4 , I say , " Try it . " To have a woman Vice President , or for that matter a black President , could have better effects than people think . <P> Christina Chin San Francisco <P> Nominating a woman for Vice President in order to get votes still reeks of exploiting women . Can not the candidate 's skill and integrity be the basis for the choice ? <P> Karen L. Mulder <P> Thornwood , N. Y. <P> <P> You wonder if America is " ready " for a woman Vice President . That is not the question . This nation is always ready for the ablest candidate , male or female . Women , however , have apparently failed to exhibit the required qualities . Your report makes it evident that women will fail again . The question is not when will America be ready for a female Vice President but , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidency ? <P> <P> Donald Waterworth <P> Newfolden , Minn . <P> <P> At this stage in our civilization 's progress , the masculine approach has become ridiculous and can only end in the demise of the human race . It is time we paid attention to the ideas of the other sex . <P> <P> John E.I. Cults <P> Mahwah , N.J. <P> <P> Whether a woman carries the vice-presidential laurels in the ' 84 elections is irrelevant . The vast potential of women , once let out of the bottle , can never be forced back . Men who might run scared to the polls to vote against a woman Vice President will gradually be outnumbered by women doing just the opposite . <P> Barbara Ann Markel <P> Tel Aviv <P> Women are emotional . They are also unaware of the exigencies of life , and they lack objectivity . <P> Joseph B. Delia Polla Philadelphia <P> Having a woman for Vice President sounds great . We would not have to pay her as much as a man . <P> Heber F. Whyte <P> Warden , Ill . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice presidency or any position that will take them outside their homes . <P> Charles O. Carr <P> Cleveland <P> You describe my 1970 quote on women 's " raging hormonal imbalance " as baroque sexism , citing my lurking " atavistic suspicion " that women are not stable enough to occupy positions of leadership . I do not want to get deep into the science of sexual differences , but it is the male hormone , testosterone , that makes the man , with his drive and macho behavior . The ambitious female politician or leader can come about only by an inborn androgyny , produced by a high level of that male hormone with its attendant aggressiveness . This male trait , admittedly not a very attractive one , is the single aptitude womanly women just do not have , and this is agreed to by both male and female scientists . <P> <P> Edgar F. Berman , M.D. <P> Lutherville , Md . <P>
