Of moles and the Mob <P> The International Brotherhood of Teamsters meets next week in Las Vegas , where many of the casinos have been financed in part by loans from the pension funds of the union 's 2 million members . The principal duty of the delegates will be to elect interim President Roy L. Williams , 66 , to a full five-year term , and some will do so without much enthusiasm . The new head of the Teamsters , which has had trouble with the Justice Department for 25 years , has been indicted three times-in 1962 , 1972 and 1974-on federal charges of embezzlement and records falsification , but was never convicted . In 1977 Williams was forced under Government pressure to resign as a trustee of the union 's Central States Pension Fund , now worth $2.8 billion . Last week he was indicted again , this time on charges of trying to bribe Senator Howard Cannon of Nevada , ranking Democrat on the Commerce Committee . <P> The latest charges stem from " Operation Pendorf , " an FBI investigation into labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago federal grand jury , Williams , Chicago Insurance Broker Allen Dorfman and three others told Cannon that if he would delay consideration of a bill designed to deregulate trucking rates and routes , he would be allowed to buy some valuable Nevada property owned by the Teamsters pension fund . The deal never came off . Cannon voted for a weakened version of the trucking deregulation bill , which passed . The Justice Department has told the Senator that he will not be indicted , but one official in the Justice Department 's organized crime unit said , " We 're not about to canonize Cannon . We do n't think he will come off looking very good at the trial . " <P> The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations last week added to the Teamster boss 's woes ; it released a report charging that Williams has ties to organized crime and is under the " complete domination " of Kansas City reputed Mob Boss Nick Civella . The report called the new Teamster chief " an organized crime mole operating at senior levels of the Teamsters Union . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a scheme to receive cash skimmed from Las Vegas casinos . The subcommittee asked the Labor Department to investigate Williams ' suitability for the Teamster 's job and to seek a federal court order to oust him if he can not clear up the allegations of corruption .
