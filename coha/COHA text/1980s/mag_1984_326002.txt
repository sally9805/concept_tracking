High bids and dud missiles <P> The Army 's Sergeant York antiaircraft weapon , made to shoot down enemy helicopters , has proved a lemon . Known also as DIVAD ( Division Air Defense ) , the system has two radar-guided guns attached to an M48A5 tank chassis . DIVAD has had trouble detecting decoys and hitting helicopters that do not have radar reflectors attached . Nonetheless , the Pentagon has invested $1.5 billion in 276 DlVADs , and last week Richard DeLauer , Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering , was preparing a report for Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger on whether to buy 117 more . While DeLauer was at work , a study by the Defense Department 's inspector general surfaced : it revealed that the Pentagon had paid $84 million more than necessary for the expensive and useless weapon . The study was released by Oregon 's Republican Congressman Denny Smith , a fierce opponent of DIVAD . According to the report , the Pentagon was too concerned with producing the weapon swiftly to bargain carefully with the manufacturer , the Ford Aerospace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a division of Ford Motor Co . Said Smith : " Not only are we buying a DIVAD that does n't work ; the taxpayers are being ripped off by excessive charges . " <P> <P> Sidewinders and Sparrows are the bread and butter of America 's air-to-air fighting capability : the $59,000 Sidewinder missile can zoom toward targets within an elevenmile range at twice the speed of sound ; the $169,000 Sparrow missile is able to hit a target 31 miles away . But according to Frank Conahan , an investigator for Congress 's General Accounting Office , one-quarter of the Navy 's and Air Force 's Sidewinders and one-third of their Sparrows are " unserviceable . " Conahan 's congressional testimony last week was just another in this year 's endless stream of reports on military unreadiness . <P> In a rebuttal , Assistant Secretary of Defense Lawrence Korb later testified that defects crippled only about 21% of the Navy 's missiles . Korb 's estimate for useless Air Force missiles was 15%.                 @ @ @ @
