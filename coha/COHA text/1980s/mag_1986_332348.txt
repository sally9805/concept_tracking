Bulldozers last week razed the charred ruins at Crossroads , a black squatter camp five miles southeast of Cape Town , where fierce fighting between radical youths and conservative vigilante groups left at least 36 dead and more than 30,000 homeless . At the same time , the South African government was debating new measures to grant security forces sweeping powers to control the turbulence that has wracked the country for the past 21 months . Critics charge that the proposals , which would allow police to detain people for up to 180 days without trial , will reinforce the apartheid system and virtually reinstitute the harsh state of emergency that was lifted on March 7 . In a rare show of defiance , the Indian and mixed-race houses of the tricameral Parliament are blocking the bills . Meanwhile , white members of the ultraright Afrikaner Resistance Movement again clashed with police as they continued their campaign of disrupting meetings of the ruling National Party . Earlier last month , white police in the northern Transvaal town of Pietersburg were forced to fire tear gas at the movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " Pik " ) Botha to address a rally . Against this troubled backdrop , Botha held an hour-long interview in his Cape Town office with TIME Executive Editor Edward L. Jamieson and Johannesburg Correspondent Peter Hawthorne . Excerpts : <P> On Crossroads . Eight years ago there was no Crossroads . Due to various phases of economic recession , many of the black people in the homelands and their own areas could not find jobs , so they flocked here illegally . We started to negotiate with them and offered to return them to their homes and to try and find jobs for them . We spent millions and succeeded in creating thousands of jobs , but the influx became too great . We warned that factions would be killing each other before long . The faction fighting started , and now we are getting the blame . <P> On foreign reaction to South African border raids . We can not be held to ransom by the U.S. or the international community when it comes to the protection of our security . We simply do not understand how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Libya , to proclaim that the U.S. will protect U.S. interests and citizens against any form of terrorism wherever it occurs , and then urge all governments in the world to do the same , but when we do it and , with all respect , do it more professionally than they do , the U.S. blames us . <P> On South Africa 's relations with its neighbors . We made it abundantly clear to the U.S. Government , to the United Nations , to the world , that we stand for peaceful negotiations . We expect from our neighbors the same behavior . Some of our neighbors are indeed cooperating , having come to the conclusion that harboring terrorists would in the end only lead to greater violence and economic retrogression for themselves . Other governments unfortunately have not . Once you have exhausted your representations on a diplomatic level , you reach a point where you know you can not continue because your government virtually becomes an accomplice , withholding the facts from its public and allowing bombs and mines to explode , blowing up blacks and whites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
