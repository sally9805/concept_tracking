This is the most common plea that Diana Silcox , a professional time-management consultant , hears from the hundreds of women she meets each year . She says women , especially working mothers , yearn for a half hour , a few hours , a whole day sometimes , just to think , read , or putter at a hobby . Too many women , she has observed , feel overwhelmed , by lack of time for their multiple roles as workers , wives , mothers , homemakers , and volunteers. // When Diana Silcox comes to the rescue , her effort is not to stretch the 24-hour day . Instead , she helps women reorder and command those hours so that essential things do ge done , and there is still time left over " for me . " There are basic principles of time management , she says , that can apply in office , home , family , and personal situations . She details these in her new book , " Woman Time , " which will be published this month by Wyden Books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her career at the age of 19 as a clerk-typist at a credit bureau in Santa Ana , Calif . Within 10 years she had worked for a variety of corporations , using efficiency and time-management skills she acquired along the way . By nature a well-organized person , she felt sufficiently successful at sharing her time-management techniques to open her own office systems business in New York in 1973. // She learned enormously , she says , from Alan Lakein ' s book , " How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life , " but decided to direct her own book to time-control problems of women only . In 1978 the Gillette Company commissioned her to develop and analyze a pioneer project on women titled " Managing Your Morning . " This enabled her to meet and discuss time problems with several hundred women around the country . She benefited , too , from being the daughter of a working mother who knew how to delegate jobs to her children and engage the whole family in supporting the household. // Miss silcox has had to prove most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During her first year or so in business she worked 18 hours a day , weekends inv cluded , doing it all herself , delegating nothing , and rushing from meeting to meeting for fear she would miss something , or not be visible to potential clients. // " I was developing into a one-dimensional job bore , a work drudge who was cultivating no outside interests and whose social life had deteriorated to zero . That ' s when I began , with some exasperation with my higly efficient self , to demand more time for me , time to go the ballet , or a Broadway show , time for friends . I needed to balance work and organizational activities with other things that were fun and stimulating. " // To get that balance , she followed the advice she now shares with other busy women in her book , lectures , workshops , and seminars . She started by focusing on what absolutely must be done . She began to rethink her priorities and to ask herself . " What is the most important use of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t do this chore immediately and to perfection ? " This helped her to put first things first and to delete or postponed or delegate many other things. // She discovered she was making the mistake , common to many women , of expecting too much of herself . She was trying to get everything done alone , and without sufficient plan or strategy . She came to understand better the working wife and mother who said to her , " I ' m tired of struggling to be superwoman and feeling guilty because I can ' t do everything and be everything to everyone . " And her sympathy grew for the harassed housewife who complained to her , " When it comes to time , life is just one big traffic jam. " // For one week she kept a time log of her activities . For every 15-minute interval she listed what she was doing , where , and with whom , and whether it was a planned activity or an interruption . She disliked every minute of this kind of marking time but persevered until problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was opening and reading every piece of mail , even junk mail . She was answering every phone call , going to every seminar , cleaning her own house , doing her own laundry , and handling her own typing and filing. // Resetting her priorities included establishing her right to a rich personal life as well as a full professional life . She then hired a cleanning woman and a secretary . She started sendind her laundry out , doing more shopping by phone and mail , and skipping more meetings . As a result , she became more socially available , more relaxed , and better company . The " support systems " she had devised for herself were freeing her from the time treadmill that had been warping her sense of completeness as a person. // Today she helps other women work out the particular support systems that will best release time for them . These might include eating out more often , obtaining more labor-saving appliances , or assigning more household jobs to husband and children. // When she began to teach her methods to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term " time management . " They felt it connoted rigid , restricting efficiency with no flexibility or freedom to do spontaneous things . She now speaks in terms of " controlling your time and making it your servant , not your master . " She assures women that planning can provide a flexible schedule in which to accomplish all the musts , with extra time left over . The solution , she says , is not in learning how to do it all more efficiently , but in learning how to do less more effectively. // Miss Silcox says that those women who manage to get the most time for themselves are those who value themselves enough to claim it . Women have to teach both husbands and children to respect their " alone " time , but they also have to explain why it is all a good idea . Children are very quick to understand and respect what is " mommy ' s time , " she says. // She finds that women who manage best keep their personal calendars up to date and do not try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all their notes and lists in one small notebook that fits into the purse , rather than on dozens of scribbled bits of paper that float about and get misplaced. // She advises women to learn to discourage drop-in visitors who can consume hours of time , to learn to wind up telephone calls quickly and gracefully , and to master the dictation of a succinct , complete message to a telephone answering machine or a secretary . Refusing to speak to an answering device is a big waste of time , she says , no matter , how much you may dislike them. // She urges wives and mothers to discuss fully their time goals , priorities , and plans with all members of their families  --  to communicate their hopes and expectations for getting time and tasks under control. // She further suggests that wives and mothers think through all the things they currently feel " obligated " to do and recognize their areas of overcommitment. // Finally , Miss Silcox thinks women should take full advantage of every available labor- saving appliance and use shopping , food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed money , and that the money spent to gain additional time is usually well worth it. // //
