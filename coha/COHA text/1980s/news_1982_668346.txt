Salvage and shoe king Dan Dunn throws his hat into the boxing ring April 19 with a show at Roseland in Taunton . Dunn , 46 , is the new entry in the local promoting fraternity , which is bound by the unshakeable conviction that club fighting has an audience - somewhere . The first show at the 1000-seat ballroom will feature several Petronelli fighters - James Lucas , Ray Curet , Doug Sherrin , Dan Avery and Steve Hillyard - as well as Taunton ' s own Bobby Cananzey . The modest debut will include five six-rounders and two four- rounders . " I ' m going to do three or four shows at the least , " said Dunn . " It doesn ' t matter if I make money or lose . " Dunn is a Shreveport , La. , native who fought three years as a pro . He came to Massachusetts 12 years ago and built up an insurance salvage business and a retail-wholesale shoe business in Hyannis . He is a rarity - a club promoter with money . " It looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys are trying to run on a shoestring , " said Dunn . Dunn is scaling Roseland at $8 for adults and $4 for children 12 and under . The $8 ticket is reasonable considering the card doesn ' t have a true main event . " I want the place filled up , " he said . " I ' d rather give tickets away than have empty seats . " - Local afficianados wonder how far Lowell ' s Dick Eklund could go with proper handling . Eklund , who will appear Thursday on ESPN fighting Mark Harris at the Sands in Atlantic City , is a sad case of neglected talent . The 24-year-old welterweight , who once lost a 10-round decision to Ray Leonard , is in effect training himself in the basement of his home . He doesn ' t see much of his trainer Johnny Dunn because Dunn is in Boston and he is inLowell . Eklund says he doesn ' t go to Art Ramalho ' s West End Gym in Lowell - where he trained as an amateur - because Dunn and Ramalho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard thing is finding someone to spar with , " said Eklund . " I ' ll go into this fight without sparring at all . " Eklund is recovering from a swollen left knee suffered while jogging . Alice Ward , his mother and manager , advised him to pass up the Harris fight . But Eklund needs the $3000 payday . " I can ' t afford to wait another month , " he said . " Luckily I never have to worry about weight . I ' m always at 145 and I eat like a pig . " He last fought Jan. 7 , losing a split decision to Kevin Howard , who recently defeated Bobby Joe Young , Ring ' s ninth-ranked welter . He took the Howard fight on two hours notice , after having prepared for a lesser opponent . Harris , Ring ' s 23d-ranked welter and a recent victor over 11th- ranked Adolfo Viruet , is a big opportunity for Eklund . " If I win they ' re talking about a $25,000 fight with Marlon Starling next , " said Eklund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I won ' t stop . They ' ll have to chop my legs off before I stop . " - South Boston middleweight Danny Long took a beating last week from Tony Suero , Philadelphia ' s rising young star . Suero KOed Long in six and knocked him down four times . Trainer Jim Connelly says Long needs a rest . " He ' s not training right , " said Connelly . " He ' s working three or four jobs and he doesn ' t have his mind into fighting . " . . . Two Connelly fighters have upcoming bouts . Middleweight Danny Cronin ( 5-0 ) goes in Scranton , Pa. , on the 28th , and heavyweight Billy Cronin ( 3-0 ) is on Rip Valenti ' s April 30 card at the Cape Cod Coliseum . . . The New England Golden Gloves team failed to win a national title for the eighth straight year last weekend in Kansas City .
