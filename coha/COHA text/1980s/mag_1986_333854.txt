Mario Vargas Llosa 's autobiographical novel Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter amorously paired a young man with an older woman . In The Perpetual Orgy , a highly original work of nonfiction , part literary testament and part critical study of Madame Bovary , the author confesses to carrying a torch for the novel 's heroine , soon to be 130 . Peru 's Vargas Llosa belongs to a long line of Emma Bovary 's professional admirers . Gustave Flaubert 's scandalous character has vamped the imaginations and intellects of writers from Baudelaire to Woody Allen , whose l971 short story The Kugelmass Episode conjures a contemporary character who can transport himself to Yonville to play a role in Madame Bovary . " The mark of a classic , " wrote Allen , " is that you can reread it a thousand times and always find something new . " <P> Vargas Llosa would agree . He was a student in Paris when he first encountered Emma nearly 30 years ago . Of subsequent rereadings , he writes , " I have always had the sensation that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling is especially keen when the novel is discussed along with Flaubert 's intimate correspondence . Vargas Llosa does this with elan and insight not unexpected from one of the world 's most accomplished novelists . <P> The relationship between Flaubert and Emma Bovary emerges as a passionate substitute for real life . " The one way of tolerating existence , " he wrote , " is to lose oneself in literature as in a perpetual orgy . " In turn , Vargas Llosa pulls off a great escape by transforming criticism into a sensual romp . It is a delightful experience , for it is not often that an international man of letters admits to preferring pornography to science fiction and sentimental stories to horror tales . Perhaps even more daring is his avowal of old-fashioned formalism , of books " that are rigorously and symmetrically constructed , with a definite beginning and a definite end , that form a closed circle and gave the impression of being perfect , finished works . " <P> His ideal , of course , is Madame Bovary , a novel whose only flaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a cozy read . Emma 's large appetites and rebelliousness may be less scandalous today , but they are no less frightening than they were to the l9th century French bourgeoisie . <P> Yet it is the intensity of her needs that ensures her greatness as a literary character , a point that elicits wholehearted sympathy from Vargas Llosa , who as an outspoken young writer and Peruvian hotspur once caused quite a stir in conservative Lima . " It is not only the fact that Emma is capable of defying her milieu , " he writes , " but also the causes of her defiance that force me to admire that elusive little nobody . These causes are very simple and stem from something that she and I share intimately : our incurable * materialism , our greater predilection for the pleasures of the body than for those of the soul , our respect for the senses and instinct , our preference for this earthly life over any other . " In making this pronouncement , Vargas Llosa satisfies his own craving : to make love to a masterpiece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
