Gov . Edward J. King and his former public relations man are playing cute , behind-the-scenes political games in connection with the PR man ' s $1.5 million damage suit against ex-MBTA boss Barry Locke and the transit authority . The stakes for the governor and Martin Burke , who handled public relations for King during his 1978 campaign for governor , are high . Burke and his attorney , Frederic N. Halstrom of Boston , would like nothing better than a jury trial this summer before the crucial primary contest between King and former Gov . Michael S. Dukakis . Since that won ' t happen , Halstrom is moving for immediate depositions of other principals , including Burke himself and King campaign chief Paul May , to intensify the war of nerves with King . May , who worked closely with Burke during the 1978 campaign , continues to be one of the very few confidants King has . The governor ' s MBTA officials , meanwhile , are countering with delaying strategy of their own . They want to prevent the Burke deposition or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information in it will not find its way to the media . Motions to accomplish these ends and another motion to impound the forthcoming deposition of May were filed in Middlesex Superior Court last Thursday morning . Officially , attorneys for the MBTA claimed that there is no " legitimate reason " for Halstrom to depose his own client ( Burke ) and that such a deposition could result in " potentially prejudicial pretrial publicity which might interfere with its ( the T ' s ) right to a fair trial by an impartial jury . " " The plaintiff ' s counsel has conducted several depositions of employees of the defendant MBTA . Matters inquired into in those depositons , as well as actual excerpts of the deposition testimony , have in the past appeared in local newspapers . " Two articles from the Herald American were cited . According to Burke , Halstrom wants to take his deposition this weekbecause in the two years since his litigation commenced , the MBTA has not deposed Burke or sent him interrogatories to answer . Halstrom won this round Thursday afternoon when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depose Burke and that he would not impound the Burke or May depositions . The judge said he doesn ' t believe in hiding things from the public . The real reason for the counter tactics by the MBTA is to forestall the possibility that potentially embarrassing information may surface into voter view during the remaining 10 weeks of the King-Dukakis primary fight . Locke and King go back a long way - to King ' s heyday at Massport in the 1960s - and Locke had become one of the governor ' s favorites just before he was indicted by Atty . Gen. Francis X. Bellotti . The touchy brouhaha between King and Burke , who worked so diligently for the governor ' s election four years ago , began suddenly on June 10 , 1980 , immediately after Locke took over as King ' s chief troubleshooter at the T. Lock bounced Burke from his post only a month after he had been given a $5000 merit raise by former MBTA Gen. Mgr . Robert Foster for his excellent job performance . The coldness with which Locke wielded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the T shocked most observers familiar with Burke ' s contributions to the King campaign . What role the governor had in the firing has never been disclosed publicly . At minimum , Burke ' s dismissal , which Locke always insisted was ordered because Burke ' s specific job was eliminated , received the passive approval of King who made no move to restore him to any state post after Locke took complete control of the Transit Authority and fired Burke . A few months after he was forced out of the MBTA , Burke retained Halstrom , who won a record $4 million in awards two and a half years ago for a paralyzed former Wareham firefighter , his wife and the widow of a man killed in a 1974 gas tank explosion . Halstrom contested the firing of Burke on several grounds , including the fact that Burke was a twice-wounded Marine combat veteran of theVietnam War whose 30 percent disability prohibited his termination under federal law . Halstrom also contends that his client has been " blackballed " by the King administration and unable to gain employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he filed the action against Locke and the T after " getting the run-around all that summer from Gov . King . " Five days after Locke moved against Burke , Gov . King was interviewed on WITS radio and stated that he had just become aware of the situation and hoped something could be done for Burke . In the ambiguous manner that occasionally characterizes his public statetments , King told the radio audience : " We ' ll be talking with Mr. Burke and it ( the firing* doesn ' t necessarily mean that there is no job for him at the MBTA . " In September , according to Burke , King advised him there was no place in state government for him and that he should look to the private sector . Burke ' s then filed his complaint in Middlesex Superior Court , alleging that " Locke intentionally , and without cause or privilege , interfered with Burke ' s advantageous relationship with the MBTA , causing Burke to sustain the loss of his salary , benefits , etc. and inflicting extreme emotional distress , embarrassment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February , 1981 , Halstrom took the Locke deposition . It took three days to complete the examination of the former T boss , who insisted that Burke was let go because the post he had been filling had been eliminated . One of the more significant aspects of the Locke depositions is the fact that Locke ' s lawyer was Robert Tatel , who also was jailed for complicity in some of the same shakedown and kickback schemes for which Locke is serving time . During the Locke trial , attorney Joseph Elcock , general counsel for the MBTA and head of the T ' s law department , testified that " he ( Locke* gave me the name of Robert Tatel as an individual who was a competent young attorney and he wanted me to consider whether or not I could give him some legal work . " On one occasion , Elcock said , Locke called him and asked him to expedite payment to Tatel for his services . And after Burke filed his suit , Locke told him that he wanted to use Tatel to handle his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last month , Tatel was suspended from the practice of law in Massachusetts by the Supreme Judicial Court . Another law firm - Parker , Coulter , Daley &; White of Boston - has been retained by the MBTA in the current challenge to Burke and Halstrom in Middlesex Superior Court . The T also is expected to engage other outside legal counsel to replace Tatel and represent Locke in the ongoing Burke litigation .
