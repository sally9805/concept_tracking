Renault comes to rescue AMC <P> If Washington is willing to prop up Chrysler , will Paris help salvage American Motors ? Apparently so . Last week AMC and France 's state-owned Rgie Nationale des Usines Renault , Europe 's fourth largest car company , unveiled a labyrinthine financial deal that amounts to a Big Money bailout of the weakest and smallest of the major U.S. automakers . The survival scheme , which the firms have been negotiating since July , would inject $500 million in cash into AMC . Also , the deal could wind up providing Renault , which already holds 5% of AMC 's stock as a result of a 1979 financing plan , with 55% of the company 's shares . Said AMC President W. Paul Tippett Jr. : " Renault would not have made this commitment unless they had confidence in the future of American Motors . " <P> Officials of both companies insisted last week that AMC management will remain in American hands . But Renault will now be able to name five of the 16 members of the company 's board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.65% market share as a base for further expansion into the U.S. market . <P> For AMC , the financial boost comes not a moment too soon . The company 's macho-looking line of four-wheel-drive Jeeps , which convey a sort of L.L. Bean sexiness to suburbanites , helped lift AMC 's profits to a record $84 million last year . But sales of the fuel-thirsty vehicles have fallen 41% this year . During the first nine months of the current fiscal year , AMC lost $74.4 million . <P> With its new money , AMC will now be better positioned to complete plans to introduce a new car or Jeep model every six months from now through 1985 , thereby offering customers twice the variety that the Big Three automakers have traditionally provided . For the present at least , the firm that might more accurately be called Franco-American Motors has been saved by le bailout.
