On June 6 , 1986 , the 42d anniversary of D-Day , " The Friday Club " endured what executive producer Winston Propp likes to call " the Chernobyl show . " During that evening ' s broadcast , a camera broke , two mikes dropped out , the studio monitor didn ' t work and the audio cassette deck failed  --  among other glitches . " Everything , " said Propp , " melted down . " A week later , however , on an anniversary of a different sort , the Midwest ' s " only live TV variety show " was back . The Friday Club ' s 104th program , marking its second year on the air , took place on the only Friday the 13th of 1986 . This is the netherland of public access television , that curious channel on cable systems whose highlight is generally the computer graphic announcing the programming lineup . It is a medium , Propp said , that often features " two people sitting here talking about what play they ' ve seen " against a rug-on-the-wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushing the outside of the public-access envelope . With no budget and an all-volunteer staff working out of the less-than- spacious Evanston Cablevision studios , the show has somehow managed to send an hour ' s worth of live mayhem into cable-equipped suburban households each Friday night for more than a fifth of a decade . Its success is growing . The studio audience has sometimes numbered 80 people , says Mary Spalding , the show ' s director , and The Friday Club has been aired on stations in the Boston area and in Portland , Me . In July , the show took first place in the category " Live Programming , Community Producer , Single ( Show ) " at the Hometown U.S.A. Video Festival , sponsored by the National Federation of Local Cable Programmers and including more than 1 , 200 entries from 36 states . What , exactly , is The Friday Club ? " It ' s formatted in between ( David ) Letterman and ' Saturday Night Live , ' " said Spalding . According to Paul Guinan , art director and most frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " The vaudeville of the ' 80s , " said Propp , who doubles as announcer and also sometimes is the host . It is all of those things , and , to lapse into sitcom-speak , it is also zany , nutty and madcap . It could be called guerilla television . It ' s TV ' s equivalent of the garage band ; the " Rocky Horror Picture Show " of the small screen ; " A Prairie Home Companion " for the plastic-flamingo set . The show generally features a Chicago-area band , guests  --  like Cubs ' telecast director Arne Harris and political satirist Aaron Freeman , as well as lesser-knowns  --  and the Friday Club Players  --  a rotating band of local actors and comedians who do one-time skits and running characters . Among these are Bozo the Pimp , a bad mad scientist and Aram Oak Abrahms , champion of the Terrorist Olympics . His main weapon is a cable decoder exactly like the ones sitting on the TV sets of the viewers . There have been audience sing-alongs of " The Brady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butterfly stroke on a coffee table and an on-air phone call to Moscow during the Goodwill Games . On the award-winning episode , a show with a comic-book theme that Guinan put together and hosted , the publisher of a local comics company , a 15-year- old illustrator and an independent publisher were interviewed . The lead singer of the band , A Fine Mess , wore a Batman T-shirt . And in and around the studio , throughout the show , a battle raged between an evil space monster and a character called Super Geno . That show , in addition to being Guinan ' s first as host , landed him his daytime job : as a production artist and penciller at Chicago ' s First Comics . The Friday Club can be seen live at 10 p. m. in Evanston , Lincolnwood and Niles , said Propp , and sometimes in other towns served by the Cablevision network . It also airs , on a two-week delay , at 7 p. m. in 13 north and northwest suburbs served by Cablenet . Propp , Spalding and Guinan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Access Corp. will begin airing their handiwork in the city when the company starts to broadcast , sometime before October . Mike Addyman , Chicago Access ' s production manager , said he was open to the idea . The Friday Club regulars , meanwhile , say they ' re open to most any idea : Anybody who wants to work on production is welcome , as are videotape submissions . " I think we all feel that it ' s important to let as much creativity flow as possible , " said Spalding , who ' s studying for her master ' s degree at Northwestern University . " I always say if somebody has an idea that has a beginning , a middle and an end and fits into the format of our show , I ' m going to let them try it . " Propp , who works as a free-lance advertising copywriter and video producer , says he sometimes feels like the Ed Sullivan of Evanston  --  with one essential difference : " We ' d shoot Elvis from the waist down .
