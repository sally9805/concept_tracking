When the world 's largest active volcano erupted for the first time in nine years , it did so with spectacular fury . Fountains of fiery lava shot 400 ft. into the air from the 1-mile-wide crater at the summit of Mauna Loa ( 13,677 ft . ) .

At week 's end the menacing wall had oozed to within four miles of Hawaii 's second-largest city , Hilo , ( pop . 35,000 ) . <P> A second outbreak from a 6,000-ft. - wide fissure farther down the mountain kept stoking the 2,000 F flow . For a while , one stream crept toward the isolated , minimum-security Kulani prison camp .
