The pregnant Yvette probably stayed clear of the conflict raging between armed riot police and militant Colored ( mixed-race ) protesters. // But within 15 minutes of leaving the house , Yvette - a popular , mixed-race girl - lay dead at the garden gate of the Morkel family in River Street , shot through the chest by a police rifle as she struggled to open the latch. // She was one of more than a dozen people killed in a wave of violence which erupted Sept. 6 on the sandy and windswept wastes known as the Cape flats. // // Some 1 million people inhabit the highly politicized neighborhoods and ghettos of the Cape flats . More than half are of mixed race , and the rest are black. // The Sept. 6 conflict was the culmination of more than four weeks of intense protest against the election for the white , mixed-race , and Indian parliaments. // Police action on that night has been the focus of a serious confrontation between President-elect Frederik de Klerk and anti-apartheid leaders. // But after a hectic day of negotiations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reformed Church - the main Afrikaner church to which most goverment members belong - and anti-apartheid leaders , Mr. de Klerk expressed his sympathy for those who had died in the violence and gave the go-ahead for a multi-racial peace march through downtown Cape Town , yesterday. // The historic peace march by between 15 , 000 and 20 , 000 people of all races was the first of its kind since a nationwide emergency outlawing such protests was declared over three years ago. // The march , which followed a route from St. Georges Cathedral to the City Hall , coincided with the reconvening of parliament after last week ' s election in which the ruling National Party ' s majority was substantially reduced. // The protesters , in buoyant mood and chanting freedom slogans , marched arm-in-arm in one of the biggest public protests South Africa has seen in more than 30 years . The orderly crowd displayed large yellow banners with the words : Peace in our city - stop the killings . Hundreds of police monitored the march but did not intervene as Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before the march , Archbishop Tutu described De Klerk ' s decision to allow the protest as ' ' a victory for the people and for peaceful protest. ' ' // The Rev. Lionel Louw , an anti-apartheid church leader , said at a short service in St. George ' s Cathedral before the march that the protest marked a historic day for South Africa. // ' ' We have assembled here as a city to express our outrage at what has happened - the killing of 3-year-old children and pregnant women , ' ' he said . ' ' It is an outrage against the whole of humanity that such brutality can be unleashed against our people. ' ' // Anti-apartheid leaders hailed the march as a breakthrough in their campaign to establish the right of peaceful protest. // Tutu and the Rev. Allan Boesak , president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches , have claimed that 29 people were killed Sept. 6 by police using shotguns and live ammunition. // The police say that 15 people died , at least 10 of them in gang violence . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot by police. // At a media conference in the Cathedral last Friday , Tutu and Reverand Boesak demanded that De Klerk dismiss Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok , who has since accused the anti-apartheid leaders of lying and defying emergency laws. // ' ' Unless he does this , Mr. de Klerk will have no credibility at all in the black community , ' ' said Boesak. // WIDESPREAD evidence of police brutality and provocation has caused outrage across the color line. // This rage has been expressed at several highly politicized funerals of those killed in the violence . Coffins have been drapped with the outlawed African National Congress flag , and priests and activists have shouted liberation programs from the pulpits. // The allegations of police violence and brutality have been given further credence by a mixed-race policeman , Lt. Gregory Rockman , who took the rare step of airing his own account of ruthless actions by white riot police in the middle-class , mixed-race township of Mitchell ' s Plain. // Lieutenant Rockman said the white policemen had acted like ' ' wild dogs ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In many instances , he said , the police instigated the violence. // Rockman has been hailed as a hero by anti-apartheid activists and has even been interviewed on state-controlled South African television - an indication that the authorities dare not silence him. // In a significant shift within the police establishment Tuesday , 40 senior mixed-race officers backed Rockman ' s stand following a meeting between Mr. Vlok and a police delegation . Rockman was part of the delegation , but Vlok refused to meet him alone. // After the meeting Colonel John Manuel , the country ' s most senior mixed-raced officer , said Rockman had his full support and he called on the white riot squad to behave ' ' more professionally. ' ' // VLOK announced after the meeting that a senior white police officer would investigate the shootings and allegations of brutality. // Rockman has agreed to cooperate with the inquiry but insists that a judicial commission is necessary to ensure that members of the community come forward to give evidence and speak freely. // A further indication that De Klerk ' s administration is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement from police headquarters Monday that the further use of whips as a method of crowd control had been outlawed. // The statement cited negative local and international reaction to the practice as reason for the ban . But lawyers and anti-apartheid leaders said the issue was no longer whips but the recent use of live ammunition by the police. // Opposition politicians , who have demanded that De Klerk appoint a judicial commission to investigate the killings , say that De Klerk ' s response to the challenge to discipline his police force will be crucial to the future success of planned moves toward dialogue with black leaders. // There are clear indications of disagreement within the government over recent heavy-handed action against peaceful protests. // According to the police version of Yvette Otto ' s death , she was the victim of gang warfare. // But several eye-witnesses to the event told the Monitor they saw riot police - most of whom were white - first shoot 25-year-old Joseph Makoma and later Yvette , apparently without warning and without provocation. // //        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
