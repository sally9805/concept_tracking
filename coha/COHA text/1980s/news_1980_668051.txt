AUGUSTA , Ga . - Tom Weiskopf ' s worst moment in golf was also his finest . Here is the man who has sulked at the press , snapped at galleries and walked off countless courses midway through tournaments to build an unsurpassed image of unsportsmanship over his 15 years on tour . Yesterday , Weiskopf destroyed that sullen reputation in 15 minutes . You know the famous 12th hole here at Augusta National ? That gorgeous , innocent-looking par 3 with the green only 155 yards away , stashed out there behind the pond and in front of the azaleas ? Well , Tom Weiskopf shot a record-breaking 13 on that little hole yesterday . And then he was man enough to joke about his tournament-ruining tragedy after playing in to his 85 to the drumbeat of what the British call " sympathy applause . " Four-time runner-up in this Masters tournament , Weiskopf has the most incentive for victory of anyone in the star-studded field . But after hitting five balls into the water - the last four with a sand wedge , for goodness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmly and with a sardonic humor . " I hit another ball into the water on the next hole ( the par-5 13th ) . In the face of that challenge ( his 13 on the 12th ) , I wasn ' t about to lay up and play it safe , " he said . A friend commented that on the press-room TV replay , Weiskopf had appeared remarkably in control of himself during his 12th-hole ordeal . " Well , with my name , if I just look like I ' m upset now , I ' ll get fined by the commissioner of golf , " said Weiskopf . The warnings had gone out earlier about the 12th hole . " That is the spookiest hole I ' ve ever played , " said defending Masters champion Fuzzy Zoeller Wednesday . " You really get scared trying to get the ball up through the wind to that little neck of a green . " Favorite Tom Watson pointed out , " The toughest thing to do there is wait for the wind to fit the club you pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tee up the ball and then wait there for the trees behind the green to stop rustling . If you hit 6 , you wait for the wind to gust in your face . " And Jack Nicklaus , who had played earlier yesterday , had cautioned , " That drop area on the 12th ( where the players must drop their ball if they hit into the water ) is pretty muddy . I made double-bogey 5 on the hole . " Little did Jack realize that his fellow Ohioan , Weiskopf , at the very moment was almost tripling that score on the shortest hole of Augusta National . Here is how Tom related his experience at the 12th : " I told my wife , Jeanne , I felt extremely nervous before teeing off this morning . I never felt that way before here . Maybe it was a lack of confidencebecause I haven ' t been playing that well in a couple of years . " I was 3 over par going to the 12th . I hit a decent 7-iron . It hit the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I dropped a ball in front of the water . I had a perfect lie . Hit a sand wedge which hit the bank again and rolled back into the water . " Now , the next three that went into the pond , they went in on the fly . Almost bounced in . I should have taken an unplayable lie on my third drop . I just can ' t hit out of holes . " Weiskopf , taking a stroke penalty for each ball in the water , finally hit his 11th shot on the hole , again with a wedge , onto the back fringe . He got down in two for a 13 , two higher than the previous record set by Dow Finsterwald in 1951 . " I haven ' t shot a 13 since I was about 14 years old , " admitted the 37- year-old Weiskopf . " And the irony is that in 12 previous Masters , I never hit a ball into the water at the 12th until last year . " " How do I feel about it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was extremely embarrassing . Probably even more disappointing . But I will be here to tee it up tomorrow ( for the second round ) . " Weiskopf , very candid in his discussion of the searing incident , revealed that was not his first reaction . " I had many thoughts while playing the 13th and 14th holes . Thoughts like I won ' t play the rest of the tournament . But then I realized that wouldn ' t do any good . So for the last few holes , I just kept trying not to shoot too high in the 80s . " How will he control his disappointment at throwing away another chance at a Masters victory , this one so early in the tournament ? " Well , I think I ' ve lived with that fairly well in the past , " said Weiskopf . " There were really only two times here that I thought I had a chance to win on the last day . Yes , I have all four of my second-place trophies at home , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in . Actually , I don ' t like to have trophies at home . I think they should be displayed in the clubhouse where the tourney is played . I like to have pictures in my home . " Then he chuckled again . " I ' m sure I ' ll get some pictures of my 13 on the 12th hole today . Someone will send one to me with a note , Would you please autograph this for me ? ' " Watson , who was playing behind Weiskopf , was asked if he were delayed at all by the incident . " Well , I did have to wait on my two- footer at 11 until Tommy got it on the next green . And that took quite a while , " smiled Watson . What did he think about the total ? " I ' m glad it didn ' t happen to me , but I can ' t say it never will . " Hubie Green reacted similarly . " I ' ve learned not to laugh at anyone else ' s high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since the day I was leading a tourney and I one-putted for a 9 on the last green . " Jeanne Weiskopf , who unfortunately was a spectator as her husband recorded the highest score ever on Augusta ' s merciless No. 12 , summed up the family ' s reaction best : " I was numb . I really didn ' t know how many strokes he did have . Now that I know , I ' m still numb . "
