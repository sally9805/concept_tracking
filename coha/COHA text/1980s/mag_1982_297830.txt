A brouhaha at Harvard Law School over affirmative action <P> The Harvard Law Review is the top of the mountain . Its members are not only at the nation 's most fabled legal institution , but they are the superachieving 8% in each class who are selected to work on the prestigious journal . Law firms fight fiercely for the chance to pay them starting salaries that top $40,000 . Now all those who prize and depend on this carefully structured system are in an uproar . The Review has voted to throw a short rope to minority students who have not made it quite as high as their white classmates , and critics , including most of the faculty , are decrying the fall of the " last bastion of meritocracy . " <P> The turmoil began a year ago . At that time , the Review regularly elected as editors 28 students whose grades put them at the top of the 550 in their class . Another 20 were selected after a writing competition testing ability to craft the dry , footnote-laden articles that go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strikingly homogeneous group of 89 editors last year : none was black , one was Asian American and eleven were female . In contrast , the student body was 14% minority and 28% women . <P> To correct the imbalance , the Review first voted to adopt a rigid quota system . Three editors quit , and dissension among the rest was so great that two weeks later , by a 44-36 vote , the journal decided merely to allow race and sex to be considered in choosing up to eight of the 48 editors . That too drew heavy fire , and the Review put the matter on hold for nearly a year . Last month the editors narrowly approved the mildest plan yet . Starting this spring , minority applicants may submit statements describing " economic , societal , or educational obstacles that have been overcome . " One key clause , a piece of polished legalistic ambiguity , requires that anyone selected under the new system have grades " close to " those posted by students chosen in the usual fashion . <P> Women were included in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five women made the Review through the existing writing competition , up from one the year before . Buoyed by that " bumper crop , " women students passed word to the editors that they no longer wanted to be part of the affirmative action program . They feared it would only stigmatize those women who did make it . <P> For their part , minority students consider affirmative action essential . " It 's a question of having minority members on the Review with some stigma or of having virtually no minority members at all , " says Black Leader Cecil McNab . The lower grades of minority students , he adds , are the result of subtle discrimination , " not underachievement . " Minority students believe that the Review should be a voluntary organization , as it is at Yale . Otherwise , many simply will not participate in what is seen as a white-dominated system of judgment . Says Ray Hernandez , a latino : " There 's a lot of pressure on us not to succeed to the point where we 're going to alienate our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
