Rumors of a deal feed hopes of freedom for Tehran 's American captives <P> For nearly a year the 52 American hostages in Iran have been the world 's most conspicuous captives . <P> Hopes for their release have been periodically raised , and then abruptly shattered . Once again last week there was a dizzying flurry of rumors that the prisoners of the Islamic militants might soon get their freedom-perhaps in a deal involving the shipment of U.S. military supplies to embattled Iran . And once again , the final decision over their fate depended on the unpredictable judgment of Tehran 's parliament , the 228-member Majlis , a body dominated by the most fanatical followers of the Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini . <P> On Sunday the Majlis met to discuss the fate of the hostages . After a stormy public debate , the members went into secret session , which ended without a resolution of the issue ; another secret session was scheduled for Monday . Moderate forces in the Majlis defeated a motion to suspend debate until after the U.S. elections . But anti-American zealots were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote on proposed conditions for the hostages ' release that were believed to be acceptable to the U.S. <P> A hostage homecoming , if it came on the eve of a closely fought presidential election , might put Carter in the White House for another four years . The prospect of a hostage deal , however , confronted his Administration with an acute foreign-policy dilemma . Because of obvious political as well as humanitarian considerations , the President could hardly reject any reasonable terms for the freedom of the captives . Yet any U.S. concessions , particularly on the shipment of military spare parts , might compromise Washington 's neutral stance on the Persian Gulf war , thereby enraging Iraq and dismaying its pro-American supporters in the war with Iran - Saudi Arabia and Jordan . At worst , such a quid pro quo might be construed by Moscow as direct U.S. interference and thus provide an alibi for an expanded Soviet role in the conflict . <P> At week 's end Administration officials reported that Iran was considering an initial release of up to 40 hostages , with the others to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But such a partial liberation would put Carter in a political bind at home-especially if the remaining hostages were subjected to trials . Washington thus sent word to Tehran insisting on the release of all the Americans at the same time .
