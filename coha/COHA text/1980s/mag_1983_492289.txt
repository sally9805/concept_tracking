1101rost adults have been lulled in- to a sense of complacency about their teeth . They believe that once they get past the cavity-prone years up to early middle age that their teeth are safe . Nothing could be further from the truth . In fact , 70 percent of adult tooth loss results not from cavities but from an insidious problem called periodontal disease . Of the 125 million adults in the United States who still have their own teeth , 32 million are in imminent danger of losing them to an advanced stage of periodontal disease . Like cavities , periodontal disease can be blamed on bacteria  --  active ones that if left unchecked will destroy the bones and ligaments that support the teeth . Clearly , periodontal disease is one malady we should all try to prevent  --  but is there a way to stop it , or failing that , to prevent it from reaching a stage where the only solution is dentures ? The answer to both questions in most cases is yes ; however , the means to accomplish these goals is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among the issues being debated is whether a nonsurgical approach to the problem of periodontal disease is superior to , or for that matter as good as , the standard approach , which has often relied upon surgery , advocated by most dentists , periodontists and the American Academy of Periodontology itself . Periodontal-disease bacteria hide in the crevices between the teeth , feeding on substances in the mouth . The result of that feeding is plaque , a gum- cleaning by the patient . Patients who have periodontal surgery once may need it again if the deep pocket infections recur . Unless the patient changes to a better dental hygiene program after surgery , the gum infections often come back , requiring repeated surgeries . The cost of surgery and its dis-comfort have led many patients to seek an alternative to the " tradi-tional approach " used by many periodontists . For some the answer has been the controversial treatment program advocated by Dr. Paul Keyes ( rhymes with size ) . A 66-year-old dentist who retired two years ago after a 27-year career with the National Institute of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keyes is no fanatic on the fringes of den-tistry . In fact , Keyes is a mem-ber of what many would call the dental establishment  --  or at ! east he was until the furor developed over his therapy for periodontal disease . Even Keyes ' harshest critics acknowledge that he has had a very distinguished career . He has made several important con-tributions to dentistry . One , the demonstration that cavities resulted from the complex inter-action between the host , the bacteria and diets earned Keyes and a colleague the prestigious Albert Joachim International Prize in 1962 . But it is Keyes ' later work , begun in 1972 , that has embroiled him in controversy . His alternative method for treating periodontal disease relies on a microscope instead of a scalpel . It makes use of such ordinary household items as salt , baking soda and hydrogen peroxide in combination with a rubber-tipped applicator ( or round toothpick ) , an electric toothbrush and a Water Pik or equivalent . Most dentists and dental hygienists can easily learn the technique , and the bulk of the program is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether Keyes has in fact proved what he has been advocating  --  that cleansing teeth at home with baking soda and hydrogen peroxide in conjunction with dental planing and scaling of the teeth is the most effective treatment for periodontal disease . In part , Keyes is accused of bypassing the usual testing-and-publishing process ? taking his findings instead directly to the public . There are other contentions , too : That there is no scientific data to support what Keyes isadvocating and that what he is doing is financially motivated . Keyes says that he has tried to publish his findings but that his papers have been rejected , not because the research was flawed , but for other reasons . He refuses to elaborate on those reasons because he says to do so would be to resort to the same tactics being employed by some of his critics . " They would prefer to obscure the discus- sion by making charges that I 'm getting rich off of this . Last year , from lectures and consultations , I made approximately $25,000 . Does that sound like I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Others who support Keyes are quick to respond that Keyes ' work has been rejected by journals because his technique would reduce the income of many periodontists . Keyes refuses to comment . Not all the criticism leveled at Keyes is personal . Many experts simply feel that Keyes is , at the very least , premature in his conclusions , and that , by subverting the usual means for introducing a new therapy , he is doing the public a grave disservice . " I am not saying that Paul Keyes may not have some valid points . What I 'm saying is that there is as yet no published scientific evidence in a refereed professional journal to support the claims he 's making , " says Max Listgarten , D.D.S. , professor of periodontics and director of periodontal research at the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine in Philadelphia . Listgarten adds that the rules concerning the dissemination of information about new therapies are not merely something used to make the lives of researchers miserable . " The rules , " he says , " are there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which might be harmful or worthless . " As for the possibility that Keyes may be doing the public a disservice , Listgarten says : " First , let me say that some good has come from what Keyes has done . He has succeeded in making the public more aware of periodontal disease than the profession was able to . But Paul Keyes has taken a problem , periodontal disease , which is relatively complex , both in its causes and treatment , and has oversimplified it in the eyes of the public and the nonspecialized portion of the dental profession . By doing this , I think people and the dentists who are not particularly well-trained in periodontics may run into problems which could have been prevented had they not considered the problem in this oversimplified fashion . " The American Academy of Periodontology , which represents many of the nation 's periodontists , has stated in a position paper that patients who rely on Dr. Keyes ' program may be shortchanged if the method he advocates proves to be less effective than the currently practiced therapy . Keyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have been misquoted time and Dr. Keyes ' Gum Treatment 1 . If possible , find a dentist in your area who uses a phase-contrast microscope .

The fact that reporters choose to take what I have said out of context is not my fault , " Keyes says . As for the claim that he has taken his case directly to the public , Keyes says : " I have never sought any publicity . The attention has come because the public is outraged over what has been done to them . An awful lot of people have been visiting the dentist regu ? ? ? ? ? ? ? wm= .. ? ? ? ? ? ? ? wn ? ? ? ? ? ? ? lady for years .

" However , blame for the problem , according to Keyes , should not be placed on periodontists : " It 's the failure of the general dentist to diagnose and provide appropriate therapy . Most dentists are trained to deal with cavities and to restore damaged teeth , not , as I said , to recognize and treat periodontal disease . They 're playing a guessing game with their patients ' teeth : Sometimes they get away with it and sometimes they do n't . " The solution , according to Keyes , is MMPT  --  microbiologically monitored modulated periodontal therapy  --  a term he prefers to the Keyes method because it really tells what the program is based on . Parenthetically , Keyes adds that many of the things he has advocated are not new or revolutionary , but are part of well-accepted periodontal therapy  --  something many of his critics acknowledge . However , Keyes is saying several things that are departures from what the American Academy of Periodontology refers to as " prevailing periodontal therapy . " We will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocates using a phase-contrast microscope to augment the conventional clinical exam . This microscope , which costs approximately $2,000 , permits the dentist and the patient to view the bacteria in the patient 's mouth . " Identifying the organisms causing an infection is a basic tenet of medicine , " says Keyes . " By having patients view the organisms , they are better able to understand what is going on , and that helps motivate them . " Critics charge that there is no evidence that the microscope is of benefit . They also point out that , though bacteria cause periodontal disease , no one organism , or for that matter group of organisms , has been indicted . Keyes disagrees , saying there is evidence that spirochetes and gram-negative motile rods are key participants and that his expercontinued on page 110 lar item on the menu was whole-wheat bread , and there was n't a slice to be found in the dining room after the group met for lunch or dinner .

That is the equivalent of two tablespoonfuls . Unprocessed bran is available in most grocery stores today . Many good cereals are now listing the percentage of nonnutritive food fiber by weight on their labels . One pitfall Dr. Burkitt warns about is the misconception that a salad can provide the necessary fiber one needs . While some vegetables are good sources of fiber , Dr. Burkitt refers to lettuce as no more than " packaged water " and fiber poor . There is one thing those deciding to add fiber to their diet need to keep in mind . Transiently , they may experience slight gas  --  something that , according to Dr. Almy , usually dissipates within about six to eight weeks . All in all , it is an exceedingly small price for the long list of benefits that accompany increasing one 's fiber intake . The verdict on fiber , then , seems to be in , and a resounding " thank you " from both the public and the medical community is due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our attention  --  Denis Burkitt , M.D. Here 's to you , Dr. Burkitt : Our amber waves of grain salute you:A Gum Disease continued from page 72 ience has shown that knocking them out produces results . The microscope is also used to monitor the program 's progress . Examining scrapings from the base of the teeth and the root surfaces lets those who follow the Keyes method know whether the infection is really under control . The second part of Keyes ' program is the portion that has received most of the attention . " To many people the Keyes method is nothing more than baking soda and hydrogen peroxide . That is an unfortunate misconception , " he says  --  unfortunate because that emphasis has made some people believe that there is nothing more to preventing or curing periodontal disease than brushing with a **32;4572;TOOLONG paste once a day before bedtime . " I chose baking soda and peroxide because there is good scientific evidence that baking soda will kill the offending organisms , " says Keyes . " The peroxide is used not because , as some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacteria , but because it is effective at dispersing and disorganizing the bacteria that make up plaque . And , perhaps most important , those two ingredients were chosen because they are cheap and are available without a prescription . " Supporters of the Keyes method also add that regular use of the paste for six to eight weeks will result in whiter teeth . As for the contention that baking soda ( sodium bicarbonate ) kills the bacteria , Dr. Ernest Newbrun , professor of oral biology at the University of California School of Dentistry in San Francisco , says , " We looked at a variety of salts that we thought would be effective , including baking soda , magnesium sulfate ( Epsom salt ) and table salt ( sodium chloride ) . By far and away the best of the lot was the baking soda . " Critics charge that Newbrun 's test-tube results do n't matter . It 's what happens in the mouth , they say , that counts . Besides , they point out , no one has yet shown exactly what organisms cause periodontal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' has shown the regimen works but that other agents can be used as effectively . Patients with hypertension and others on low-salt diets , Keyes says , should consult their physicians before using the baking soda . " I doubt that there will be significant absorption of the sodium , but each patient is different and should check before using it . " Epsom salt or other agents can be used instead . Some patients may find three-percent hydrogen peroxide too irritating . They , according to Keyes , should dilute it one-to-one with water . In some cases , Keyes advocates using antibiotics to bring the bacteria under control . " This emphasizes the importance of monitoring with the microscope or the cultures . Because the disease is so insidious , the patient may be unaware of his progress . Occasionally we find that , despite our program , the bacteria are not really under control  --  that we are in essence just fighting a delaying action . In those cases we use antibiotics for 10 to 14 days , " Keyes says . The antibiotics used include tetracycline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't be used in pregnant women or young children because it can discolor developing teeth . Critics charge that Keyes is too liberal with antibiotic use . Supporters of the Keyes method counter by pointing out that the cases they see are often so far adTHE // vanced that agents such as baking soda and peroxide are n't enough . Critics also charge that , even if baking soda and peroxide were to work , delivering them on the end of a toothbrush may be ineffective . Keyes agrees . " If the pockets are larger than three millimeters , brushing wo n't be enough . We have to use other devices to get the paste into the deeper pockets  --  for example , blunt-tipped syringes . " Keyes and his critics do , however , agree on the need for mechanical cleaning of the teeth . " An important part of the program is the decontamination of root surfaces and pockets with mechanical instruments . Most periodontists refer to this as root planing , scaling and curettage , " Keyes explains . In addition , when pockets are present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructs patients in removing plaque from accessible root surfaces . Keyes ' critics say his emphasis on the pain and expense of surgical therapy is misleading . " The cost will vary greatly , depending on how many teeth are involved , and , though there may be discomfort , the description of this as ' painful ' is probably not fair , " Max Listgarten says . Keyes now works at the International Dental Health Foundation in Reston , Virginia . Here , Dr. Dan Watt , a dentist who became a Keyes believer , works with Keyes in educating other dentists in the Keyes method . Watt explains that , though periodontal disease is very common in the United States , no one knows what toll it takes in other countries . Nonetheless , Watt confesses a vision that the Keyes method coupled with the development of an antibacterial toothpaste might deal a deadly blow to periodontal disease , similar to the one that was dealt to cavities by fluoride . The bottom line in most scientific controversies is data . In this case , however , the data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that his studies , conducted while he was still at the NIDR , prove his therapy is effective . Critics charge that the results of these studies have not been published in a refereed journal . Critics also point to other studies that they say show no evidence that baking soda and hydrogen peroxide treatment is any better than the standard measures used to control plaque . The results , however , are equivocal . There is little likelihood that this controversy will vanish anytime soon . So heated is the debate that a committee of the American Academy of Periodontology is attempting to gain access to the records of patients Keyes treated while at the National Institute of Dental Research . Such action is virtually unprecedented when there is no allegation of fraudulent research , because patient records are considered confidential . A spokesman for the American Academy of Periodontology said there is no allegation of fraud . " The committee 's action , " he said , " is merely the response to a motion made by one of its members . " Regardless of this controversy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following to help prevent periodontal disease . First is to make sure that your dentist regularly checks for evidence of periodontal disease . Second , learn to recognize signs that might indicate you have a problem  --  a pink toothbrush , bleeding and/or sore gums , a sour taste in the mouth and/or bad breath . Finally  --  and perhaps central to the concept of prevention  --  institute a good oral-hygiene program . Such plans are usually best begun early in life when habits are fairly easy to establish . Mainstays of such a program are proper brushing and flossing , using unwaxed dental floss , the use of a Water Pik or similar device to remove debris from between the teeth and the use of toothpicklikc products that can also help remove debris from between the teeth . Coupled with regular dental checkups , this is the type of program that will help you keep your teeth for many years to come .
