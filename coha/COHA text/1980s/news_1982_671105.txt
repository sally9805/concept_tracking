Educators are concerned that many students who might be able to get the loans have been discouraged from applying . Among the reasons for their discouragement , according to Federal , state and local officials , are widespread misunderstanding of the regulations and delays in printing new forms. // Nationally , applications are off about 30 percent from October to the late spring compared with the same period last year . And until this spring New York ' s decline was about the same . But from April 1 to June 18 , the state received 55 percent fewer applications than in the same period of 1981 , according to Dr. Dolores E. Cross , president of the Higher Education Services Corporation , a state agency that administers loan programs. // No other state has reported as severe a drop , according to Skee Smith , a spokesman for the Federal Department of Education . One reason , Dr. Cross said , is that family incomes tend to be higher in New York than in many other states . <> <> ' Needs Test ' in Effect // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 000 a year have been required to prove that they need the money . On the basis of the " needs test , " any financial aid a student receives from his college is added to the sum of money the Federal Department of Education ' s guidelines indicate the parents can afford to pay for education . The total is then subtracted from a student ' s educational fees , and the difference is the maximum loan the student may request from the Government , up to $2 , 500 a year. // Federal officials said that because of a lengthy debate in Washington about the new regulations , many colleges only recently received the forms to process the loan applications. // The delay " has definitely been part of the problem , " said Peter Keitel , vice president of the Higher Education Services Corporation , " but this drop is worse than it should be. " // Although the services agency had estimated that the new regulations would cut eligibility for the loans by 10 percent , Dr. Cross said she had not expected such a drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a spurt of applications in September as parents rushed to complete loan requests for the 1981-82 school year before the eligibility requirements were tightened on Oct. 1 , Mr. Keitel said . But he said that did not account for the drop in applications in the spring , when families begin to apply for loans to finance the coming school year. // Education officials said that many people had apparently interpreted the change in regulations to mean that anyone with an income over $30 , 000 a year was ineligible for a loan. // " I am afraid that a lot of parents see the $30 , 000 tests as a cap , and think they don ' t qualify , " said Billie Hyde , associate director of financial aid at Fordham University , where tuition will be $4 , 950 next year. // Although more than half of families with incomes of more than $50 , 000 a year will no longer qualify for the guaranteed student loans , Dr. Cross said , 80 percent of families with incomes between $30 , 000 and $50 , 000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the 1981-82 school year , 45 percent of students receiving loans in New York State had family incomes of more than $30 , 000 , Dr. Cross said. // " Students should check and apply , " she said . " They should not assume that the changes deny them access to the loans . " <> <> Needs Not Known // George Chin , director of financial aid at the City University of New York , where tuition is $1 , 075 a year , offered another explanation for the drop in loan applications . Because City University students are not notified of financial awards until later in the summer , they may not yet know whether they need to borrow money. // In an exception to the state trend , loan applications at New York University have increased slightly from last year , according to Ollie Bryant , the school ' s acting director of financial aid . The tuition for next year is $6 , 634. // The busiest period for loan applications is still ahead , and Miss Hyde and other financial aid officials at New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the drop would affect enrollment . But they agreed that the uncertainty worried parents. // " It ' s a frightening prospect right now , " Miss Hyde said . " Parents are coming into my office and saying ' How am I going to get my child into school when I can ' t come up with the money ? ' " <> <> Interest Rate Is 9 Percent // The Federal Government guarantees the loans - which are made by participating banks - against default and pays the 9 percent interest while students are in school . Students must begin repaying the loans , including the remaining interest , nine months after they graduate. // Federal education officials offered an example of how a family ' s loan eligibility might be calculated , noting that individual cases vary . A family of four with an income of $45 , 125 , where one parent is the wage earner and one of two children is in college , would be expected to contribute $5 , 870 to their child ' s education . If their child received a $1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money available for college expenses would be $6 , 870 . If the college tuition were $9 , 500 , the student would need an additional $2 , 630 and would be eligible for the maximum $2 , 500 federally guaranteed student loan. // An alternative Federal program , now in its second year , provides higher- interest loans that must be repaid by parents , Miss Hyde said . These loans , called Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students , carry a 14 percent interest rate , and repayment must begin within 60 days of when they are made. // But state and local education officials outlined several difficulties with these loans , which are also offered to students under a program called ALAS - Auxiliary Loans to Assist Students. // Because the higher interest rates and immediate repayment requirements increase the financial burden on parents , Miss Hyde said she advised them not to apply for the loans unless they could repay them within a year . Mr. Keitel said his office had not heard of parents being turned down for the loans , but he said that few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a terrific acronym , " Miss Hyde said . " I ' m waiting for them to come out with another one that says Alack . " Miss Hyde and other education officials also expressed concern about the prospect that the needs test would be applied to all applicants for federally guaranteed loans . The budget recently passed by the House and Senate , and now awaiting further Congressional action , includes this requirement. // Applications for student loans soared after 1978 , when Congress passed the Middle Income Student Assistance Act . The act lifted a ban on loans to students with family incomes over $25 , 000 a year . In 1978 , according to Federal Department of Education estimates , 3. 4 percent of the guaranteed loans went to students whose family incomes totalled more than $40 , 000 a year . The department estimated that in 1980 , the year before eligibility requirements were tightened , the figure had risen to 20. 6 percent. //
