Any hope that the surprise resignation of Burma 's military overlord , Ne Win , 78 , would lead to reform was quickly extinguished last week . Three days after Ne Win stepped down , the Socialist Program Party , Burma 's sole legal political body , chose his protege , Sein Lwin , 64 , as its new leader ; the next day parliament named him the country 's President . A retired army general , Sein Lwin is the longtime head of the dread riot police , the Lon Htein , and one of Burma 's most feared men . He lived up to his nickname " the Butcher " when he ruthlessly suppressed student riots earlier this year . <P> While Sein Lwin is the new strongman , Rangoon may not have heard the last of Ne Win . Although he accepted some of the blame for the recent riots in &; which more than 200 may have been killed , the wily dictator seemed to have no regrets about the brutal tactics used to crush the disturbances . " When the army shoots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoots to hit . It does not fire in the air to scare . "
