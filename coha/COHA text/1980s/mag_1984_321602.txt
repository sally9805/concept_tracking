After only 15 months of power , Andropov leaves unfinished business and a country in need of leadership <P> He was a long time dying ; the world was a long time waiting . Indeed , since last fall , Kremlinology had become largely a death watch . In capitals round the world the same questions persisted : After Andropov , who ? After Andropov , what ? <P> Yet there was no sense of anticlimax when it actually happened . The news still stunned a Washington already benumbed by the latest upheaval in Lebanon . U.S. policymakers and experts were awakened early Friday morning , and their reaction was , in the main , anything but a yawn . A major event had occurred , and there was no way to be fully prepared . <P> For one thing , Soviet officials had insisted that Andropov was recovering . For another , no amount of warning and contingency planning renders the actual event routine when the deceased is the leader of the Soviet Union . So it was with Vladimir Lenin , Joseph Stalin and Leonid Brezhnev-all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time dying , and all of whose deaths occasioned not just obituaries but portentous talk of epochs and turning points . If Andropov 's passing occasioned anxiety as well , it was because questions the experts have been asking for so long could still not be answered . <P> In the Soviet Union , leadership transitions are , by definition , leadership crises . The most oppressively managed of societies and political systems has never been able to manage successions in a way that avoids conveying a sense of crisis both to the Soviet people and to the world . Top leaders never retire with honor . <P> They either die on the job ( as Lenin , Stalin and Brezhnev did ) , or they are thrown out and end up as pensioners in ignominy ( as Georgi Malenkov and Nikita Khrushchev were ) . <P> The paralysis of the Soviet gerontocracy could hardly have been more vividly demonstrated than by the macabre spectacle of Andropov 's long eclipse . For months , he was nowhere to be seen as his colleagues insisted he was suffering from " a severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventriloquial voice spoke for the Soviet leadership in carefully drafted , presumably ghost-written statements issued in Andropov 's name and in " interviews " in Pravda . <P> The Soviet leaders are unable to cope with the political implications of their own aging , infirmity and mortality for a reason that is simple and damning enough : theirs is a system based on the seizure , accumulation and consolidation of power . It has no built-in mechanisms for the sharing or transferring of authority beyond the inner circle . Every time a Soviet leader dies or is incapacitated , the world ought to be reminded of that essential fact . <P> The conservative old men who run the Soviet Union operate by two sets of rules-those that they make by and for themselves , and those that are established and enforced by the actuarial tables . Andropov 's heirs found themselves in a dilemma that underscores the irony of the Soviet Union 's youthfulness as a state ( a mere 61-six years younger than the average age of the Politburo members ) and the falsity of its claims to represent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
