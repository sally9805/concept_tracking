DESIGN FOR LIVING by Nol Coward <P> Nol Coward made mock of many social dogmas , but he was a true believer in the imperium of style . Those who had the divine spark got to ride through life on a silk cushion , inventing their own rules and then ignoring them , cutting the boorish infidels down with gay , rapier wit . Thus it is with the merrily amoral mnage in Design for Living , a triangle with some complex emotional geometry . Otto ( Frank Langella ) and Leo ( Raul Julia ) are friends ; Gilda ( Jill Clayburgh ) and Otto become lovers ; Gilda dumps Otto for Leo ; Gilda leaves them both for a stuffy art dealer ; Otto and Leo liberate Gilda from genteel sobriety . In Coward 's world the cabal of camaraderie must ever win out over the exclusivity of passion , and style consists of tiptoeing away from the mess one has made of one 's life . <P> This star-laden revival at the Circle in the Square Theater , the first Broadway mounting of Design for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead it galumphs , on thundering rhino feet , at the pitch and tempo of farce . Frenzy worked fine for Director George C. Scott in his production of Coward 's Present Laughter two years ago . Not so here , where the bonhomie is so forced that it comes across as bullying . Though Langella and Julia occasionally mine the text for subterranean veins of grace and melancholy , Clayburgh storms about with the booming baritone and great-lady gestures of a strung-out dowager . One yearns for the buoyant charm that Vanessa Redgrave brought to the role in a 1973 London revival . But charm , alas , can not be learned , earned or rented for the night . It is a quality as easy to perceive , and as rare to achieve , as Style . - By Richard Corliss
