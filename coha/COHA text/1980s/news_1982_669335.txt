// * A host of big-budget movies are headed for American screens , from ' ' Tootsie ' ' to ' ' Superman III ' ' and ' ' Revenge of the Jedi . ' ' About 20 of these ' ' megabuck ' ' items will carry price tags of $20 million or more. // // * At the same time , interest has zoomed in on low-budget projects . Variety , the entertainment trade paper , reports a new vogue for shooting on a shoestring . During the past production year , the major studios have launched some two dozen films tagged at $5 million or less - barely half the current average. // Most of these will soon be visible at local theaters . Their success or failure could help determine the future trend of Hollywood spending , so box office results will be eagerly scrutinized. // Among the expected low-budget offerings , some follow in the footsteps of previous hits , and are expected to attract audience attention easily . ' ' Smokey Is the Bandit ' ' and ' ' Psycho II , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Others will have special problems in the struggle for box office dollars , Hollywood analyst Lawrence Cohn writes . In today ' s marketplace , it costs at least $6 million for prints and promotion to put a picture into broad nationwide release . When this is more than it cost to make the movie in the first place , the moguls proceed with care , especially since low-budget items generally lack the movie stars and special effects that help to sell many standard-budget films. // Therefore , modest movies are likely to be tested cautiously in regional runs or exclusive big-city engagements for clues to their box office prospects . In some cases , a film is shunted past the theaters altogether , directly to a berth on cable television. // According to current wisdom , low-budget movies can pay off handsomely when they do click with audiences . Paramount ' s smash hit ' ' An Officer and a Gentleman ' ' has done much to foster this attitude , generating huge revenues despite its modest production style and old-fashioned story. // But other inexpensive productions have fared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' as Jill Clayburgh and Ryan O ' Neal . For this reason , Variety reports , pretesting and flexibility have become the rule in handling low-budget properties . The current ' ' Moonlighting ' ' and the recent ' ' Zoot Suit ' ' and ' ' Hey Good Lookin ' ' ' are examples of films that opened in limited ' ' test ' ' situations . Of the three , only ' ' Moonlighting ' ' still stands a chance of wider release. // Yet today ' s Hollywood seems genuinely interested in probing the possibilities of low-budget production . Major studios are setting up ' ' classics arms , ' ' inspired by the success of United Artists Classics , to explore new methods of marketing inexpensive films by aiming them at specific audiences . <> <> Holocaust drama // The movie version of Sophie ' s Choice eliminates most of the sensationalism and sexual horseplay that diluted the original novel by William Styron . The emphasis of the film is on the historical dimensions of the story , and their meaning for three flawed but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulgarity , and melodrama . But the overall result is a serious though harrowing journey into the dark corners of this century , marked by a compassionate approach and even a fillip of optimism at the end. // Set in 1947 , the story is narrated by Stingo , a young Southern writer . Newly arrived in Brooklyn , he strikes up a friendship with Sophie , a non-Semitic survivor of the Auschwitz concentration camp , and Nathan , her brilliant but unstable Jewish boyfriend. // Between them , these figures embody such concepts as Jewish suffering , European ambivalence , and American inaction . The main theme of the story is the mental and moral turbulence that has been a pervasive legacy of the Holocaust , a subject still crying out for study and understanding . In its most memorable episodes , the film probes the lingering presence of the Holocaust in the lives of those affected by it , whether directly or indirectly. // As written and directed by Alan J. Pakula , a generally tasteful and intelligent filmmaker , the movie leaves out most of the book ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confessional elements that Styron/Stingo indulged in , further tightening the story and eliminating some of its cheaper elements. // The end product is occasionally abrupt in its transitions . But abruptness is not a bad correlative for twists of experience that are dictated by the inscrutable logic of history , rather than the everyday flow of personality . It heightens the urgency of its message about the need to confront and come to terms with the residue of recent Western history. // Although the performances are of mixed quality , their level is generally high . Meryl Streep gives her deepest and fullest screen portrayal to date , carrying the complicated Sophie from sunny Brooklyn afternoons to the reeking mud fields of Auschwitz . With her studied Polish accent and catchy mannerisms , she verges on gimmicky ' ' schtick ' ' now and then . Yet she usually finds the hidden crux of even frivolous-seeming moments , bringing out some quirk of character that adds to the film ' s cumulative effect . <> <> From a French comedy // The Toy is based on a middling-good French comedy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The plot is set in motion by a spoiled little boy , who is offered anything he wants from a toy store . What he insists on ' ' owning ' ' is a man employed there - who is talked into humoring the child , and eventually becomes the friend he desperately needs. // If it had been handled properly , Donner ' s version of ' ' The Toy ' ' could have been more resonant than its French forebear , since it stresses the implications of racial prejudice and class distinction . The child is the son of a white millionaire , while the ' ' toy ' ' is a black journalist whose color has kept him out of work in the Southern community where he lives. // Donner plays up the socially conscious angle . In fact , at the climax , the ' ' toy ' ' and his young pal print a newspaper exposing the corruption of the millionaire , thus crusading for justice and enlightenment. // But good intentions count for little when stacked up against the sheer messiness of this movie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a single scene work . It ' s sad to see the talents of Pryor and Jackie Gleason wasted , along with a well-meaning and sometimes clever story line . There ' s little excuse for such trite and careless filmmaking from experienced Hollywood workers . ' ' The Toy ' ' is a most disappointing Christmas present. // //
