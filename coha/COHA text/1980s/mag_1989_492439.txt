// thing and the flowing waters thing , but five city blocks of con-n Mud is River . a Island mode Not l of at Memphis tabletop a the Missis-sippi there crete that scale every curve and con-tour , width and depth of the lower thousand miles in bold relief . More than 1.5 million gallons of water fuel the model . Slate slabs with greets of steel ribbons represent towns and cities . More than 300 bits of information along the model describe how man , nature , or both . conspired to create history . help explain how pirates once used a treacherous narrows to prey on passing boats , or how pilots inched their boats and barges past sand bars and other dangers . The role of the levees is dramatized when the model undergoes its daily " flood stage . " The visitor even hears the river , though the gurgles are but faint echoes of the real thing . The Mississippi , even combined with its major tributary , the Missouri , is still only the world 's third longest river , behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Amazon , in the center of the rain forest , largest supplier of oxygen . Neither this model , nor the neighboring museum at Mud Island , nor any statistics , explains the true role of Old Man River in our lives and our imagination . How important has the river been to our development ? Our settlers had in the Mississippi and its tributaries an ideal blue highway , linking 31 states to the Gulf . The Ohio River would give important areas in several states an avenue large enough to accommodate big steamboats . The Missouri would be even more important , slashing a thousand miles through forbidding northwestern prairie to the mountains . Access to markets permitted Americans to develop as fast as their audacity and ingenuity would allow . That effect on the economy still exists here in the heartland . Farmers this past summer were affected ( and still are ) by low water levels on the river . As the drought worsened , many argued for tapping the Great Lakes to raise levels to the necessary 9 feet in parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So much tonnage passes along the river that the port of New Orleans surpasses New York 's in shipping . A single tank barge can be more than 1,000 feet in length , and its 9 million-gallon capacity exceeds that of 1,000 railroad tank cars ; a single coal barge can hold up to 60 railroad car loads , and ten barges can be joined together in one tow . The Mississippi for travelers has one further distinction from the Nile or the Amazon . Few adventurers have ever seen the birthplace of those two rivers , but anyone can drive the entire length of the Mississippi on the Great River Road and see for himself the interplay of history , culture , and environment . He sees less of the river itself , less of Mark Twain 's steamboat highway , and more of how the great river has shaped its environs . The traveler must press on , seeking to know more . ? ? ? The journey begins in the Iron Range of northern Minnesota . One finds the Mississippi leaking out of Lake Itasca . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich watershed , until by St. Cloud it is a true river ; and by Minneapolis-St . Paul it is broad enough , a nine-foot channel gouged into its bottom , to accommodate the millions of tons of ore , coal , and grain barged toward the ocean more than 2,000 miles away . At the St. Croix there is a confluence of rivers , and then the Mississippi turns sharply southward to form Minnesota 's eastern boundary . Here it takes on its classic upper-river characteristics . Wooded hills and bluffs gently press in , seeming to keep the channel true to south , while broad valleys let the river sprawl into shallow moving lakes half a mile across with marshes and wetlands that make this still the world 's premier migratory flyway.57 The river roads here  --  in the states of Iowa , Illinois , Minnesota , Wisconsin , and Missouri  --  run near the actual river . At Pike 's Peak south of Effigy Mounds National Monument in Iowa , the confluence of the Wisconsin River creates a marshy wilderness so vast it has remained almost unchanged since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when mound builders stood on the sacred bluffs and entreated the gods to bring them success in hunting . The history of the upper Mississippi is a blend of Indian lore , old ? - L. - ? . - West , new pioneers , visionaries , hard times , quick fortunes , and just as rapid ruinations . Dubuque , Iowa , is typical  --  an architectural and historic onion that shows the steps from survival in log cabins and forts during Iowa 's territorial status , circa 1830 ; to its first wave of prosperity from mining ( 1850 ) ; on to mercantile and manufactured goods going to and coming from farmers ( 1860-1880 ) . Across the river at Galena , Illinois , is a town arrested in time , like an amber chip , the legacy of which are homes 130 to 150 years old built on the mercurial fortunes of lead  --  as were so many other villages in the upper channel . In fact , neighboring Wisconsin gets the nickname " Badger State " not from some particular love of that burrowing rodent , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in badgeresque fashion in hot pursuit of that mineral . Galena lay dormant for decades , and then experienced a rebirth about 15 years ago when people began once again appreciating old homes , old things , and a less hectic pace and so repopulated the place . This pattern is seen in such places as Alton , Illinois , and neighboring Grafton ; or at New Best of the Big Muddy There is no way to sum up all the attractions available along the entire length of the Mississippi . Below are ten representative samplings. 1 . New Orleans . Sensory overload on food and music . For breakfast , maybe Brennan 's or the totally different Coffee Pot , lunch at Dooky Chase , evening at Patout 's . Music in the Quarter . Start with a bus tour of city to sort things out . 2 . Natchez , Mississippi . Sumptuous homes that can be viewed on the spring and fall pilgrimage ; Old South Winery ; Natchez Trace and Natchez Under-the-Hill. 3 . Vicksburg , Mississippi . More Civil War flavor than Natchez , also superb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " The Vanishing Glory " ; military cemetery . 4 . Grafton-Alton , Illinois . Orchards , old homes , and very unspoiled . Grafton and even smaller Elsah are like Nantuckets of the Midwest . Alton , a bedroom community for St. Louis , has homes , history , and nearby wilderness Madrid , Missouri ; and farther down at Cape Girardeau , Missouri ; Helena , Arkansas ; or up at Prairie du Chien , Wisconsin ; or Burlington , Iowa  --  all filled with the sounds of hammers and restorers caught by a real movement of Americans to get back to their roots and live in and with quality . Each river town has a story . The visitor finds a microcosm of our dreams , themes , and roots . Although they are distinctive , they are also familiar . On the bluffs are the homes of the town leaders who made their fortunes from some river-related enterprise . Down the slopes live the laborers , workers , and merchants , often with an ethnic purity that makes the town distinctively German , French , Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river are the deposits of humanity cast up in much the same fashion as the river leaves silt : romantics and cynics , the idle and the forever toiling , the underclass . They not only see and smell the river , as can the rich man perched atop his hill , but they must live with the river  --  fleeing it in flood , slapping mosquitoes spawned by it , hauling fish out of it . They put their homes on cinder blocks or stilts and wait . areas where eagles hang out . 5 . Dubuque , Iowa-Galena , Illinois . Mines , skiing , homes , the riverboat museum , and a dog track at Dubuque . Galena also has an excellent winery. 6 . Minneapolis-St . Paul . To me it means shopping , art , and food ( Walker Art Center , Tyrone Guthrie Theater , and Nicollette Mall ) , 7 . St. Louis . Forest Park , hands down : the zoo , botanical gardens , and art museum . Also the Riverfront , Gateway Arch , and The Hill ( Italian ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creole homes , very old , some of them quite interesting in their structure , good narrative tours , and good herb gardens . 9 . Nauvoo , Illinois . One of the best freebies anywhere . The restored buildings include homes , shops , professions  --  all on well-narrated tours . Educational and entertaining . 10 . Prairie du Chien , Wisconsin . An attractive town with varied recreational areas nearby , access to quaint towns on both sides of the river , and Villa Louis . This most elegant of the Upper River estates was built by a fur trader . April ' 89 There is nothing subtle about the line of demarcation signaling entry into the southern half of the river . It is found at Cairo , Illinois , at the Ohio and Mississippi 's confluence , where the Old Man widens to 4,500 feet . No longer does the river follow geography . It creates geography ; and an ecosystem ; and a philosophy for those residents who learn to adapt to it . Fueled by the waters of not only the Ohio , but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , the river writhes and sprawls over the landscape , twisting in loops that fling deposits of silt across broad flatlands . The alleuvial fans thus formed have given the territory from Missouri to Louisiana the designation " delta . " What we find today where cotton fields grow as far as the eye can see is a handiwork that includes the 1927 flood that created a river 80 miles wide , and the 1973 flood in which 11 million acres were covered as the waters ran at flood stage for 77 straight days . The resulting soils and chronic dampness , along with ready transportation , invited a kind of farming , and a kind of living . It was cotton , and to a lesser extent sugar cane , that created a need for cheap labor . The solution would in turn create a crisis that nearly destroyed our country , but not before a class of people had cast themselves as America 's aristocracy . Once again , the river was literally vehicle as well as architect . Plantations ranked up along its banks , all with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only hauled away the valuable harvest , but also brought the slaves and the wares that allowed owners of these plantations to live in phantasmagoric splendor . And the river , fittingly , would bring the Union ships on their end-run missions to split the Confederacy and starve the South . Today the South is still a land of extremes , contrasts , and constants . Shanties are set in the shadows of those magnificent columned palaces . Riverboats and barges still chug past Frenchman 's Bend , where a black man may be bobbing for bream in a bayou so clogged with algae that it looks like an abstract painting laid flat . And on shore are the frequent crosses and monuments marking where the men in blue and gray struggled for strategic control of the river 's vital points . History is everywhere , strewn like driftwood sorted by the river . A Scandinavian photographer who had spent two months on the river said : " It is how the people relate to the river  --  that is what is important . You do n't have to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Stacy Douglas of Vicksburg knows everything about everyone and loves to tell stories about the aristocracy . But he also exhibits Southern pride as he walks you through Cedar Grove , the town 's most elegant mansion cum bed-and-breakfast . He points to the cannonball , imbedded in the inner wall , which tore through the front door when an ironclad fired on Vicksburg in the war . But the ball 's unembellished presence amid the lavish furnishings says : We were wounded , sir , but we continue . That too is the messsage from George Fines . He takes you through the streets of Natchez in his surrey and fires off outrageous bits of history , culture , and street philosophy in bursts measured to the gait of his horse , Man . The South means living with and sometimes against history . What the river brought is not always welcome , and there are dangers when people forget the errors of the past . Perhaps that is why Leah Chase , a black woman who runs Dooky Chase , one of New Orleans ' most popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think so much of what was done to blacks . She already knows that . She goes to hear the stories of how things were acquired , fortunes made and lost , of owners trying to outbuild all the others . Invariably tragedy struck : the owner dropped dead as the job was finished , the kids were wiped out , workers left to fight the war , the market collapsed . " All that vanity , " she says sadly , her eyes sparkling triumphantly . Perhaps the supreme pilgrimage to chronicle our vanity would begin with the antebellum homes and plantations around Vicksburg , then down to Natchez , over to Louisiana 's nearly forgotten town of St. Francisville , where in 1850 , it is said , half the country 's millionaires resided . From here the river takes an erratic zag to the east , creating a subtropic zone of sugar cane , swamps , bayou , and plantation rows . The land here is soft , the roads raised , but water is always close-by . You pass shanties , stands of cane , huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mansions here are more sprawling than those at Natchez or Vicksburg , lush to the point of chaos as everything is weighted down with Spanish moss , surrounded by banana trees , overripe and often musty . It is a shock to the Northerner . ? ? ? The major cities along the river are somehow separate from the river , even as so many towns mentioned were intimately tied to it . But one city is intimately associated with the Mississippi . That is the Crescent City . New Orleans is an exclamation point to the river . It personifies all the Mississippi 's extremes and contrasts . New Orleans is a city whose very survival depends on a kind of 24-hour struggle with the river . The world 's largest drainage pumping system keeps water out , and the world 's biggest shipping port depends on that water . Overflow lakes prevent flooding , and in cities of the dead , graves are still aboveground because of the wetness . The refinement and decadence Old Man River brings create New Orleans ' distinctive flavor . A walk in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's most elegant neighborhoods of Victorian homes . That stroll will end at Vieux Carr &; the French Quarter , a 90-block universe that is the dot of the exclamation point . Creole cottages with gray mansard roofs ; stuccoed Spanish buildings with filigreed arches ; Italianate courtyards with sculpted fountains and lush tropical
