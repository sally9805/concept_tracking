The Bush administration has put Syria on notice that it must bear responsibility for the actions of a Palestinian hard-line group based in Damascus. // That group , the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command ( PFLP-GC ) , is increasingly aligned with Iran and has been linked to a number of recent anti-US terrorist attacks , including the downing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland last December. // United States-Syrian relations have gone through tough times before over terrorism . The US withdrew its ambassador to Syria in 1986 because of alleged direct and indirect Syrian support for terrorism . The US ambassador only returned to Damascus in the fall of 1987 after Syria expelled the radical terrorist Abu Nidal Organization , and pledged to cooperate against terrorism and to work for the release of Western hostages in Lebanon. // // More broadly , bilateral relations have often been cool because of Syrian policies on Israel and Lebanon . Syrian President Hafez Assad is seen in Washington as one of the most implacable opponents of a negotiated peace with Israel. // Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , armed members of the PFLP-GC detained two US military attaches for eight hours . The two were observing a PFLP-GC camp near Damascus , informed diplomatic sources say , when they were approached and detained . When the US initially protested the incident , Syrian officials reportedly responded that the Palestinian radicals were making a citizens ' arrest. // On March 5 , PFLP-GC chief Ahmad Jabril signaled that his group would work to carry out Ayatollah Khomeini ' s death sentence on author Salman Rushdie . The US has already received reports of operational cooperation between the PFLP-GC and Iran. // Simultaneously , the US was receiving clandestine and public reports that Iran was mobilizing its agents and friends for terrorist attacks , which could include US targets . On Friday in San Diego , a bomb destroyed a van driven by the wife of Capt . Will Rogers III . Captain Rogers was commander of the USS Vincennes , which mistakenly shot down an Iranian passenger jet in July 1988 . ( Mrs. Rogers was not injured . ) Initial speculation has focused on the possibility that Iranian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take ' ' appropriate action ' ' to insure that the PFLP-GC does not carry through on its threat . US spokesmen say Syria must bear responsibility for the actions of the PFLP-GC because it is based in Damascus. // US-Syrian diplomatic exchanges over these subjects have reportedly been sharp. // The US has been privately pressing Syria to clamp down on the PFLP-GC for some time now . The radical group is strongly suspected of involvement , along with the Iranian Revolutionary Guards , in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 , and of plotting other air bombings last year . Its operatives are also believed responsible for two bomb attacks on US military trains in West Germany last year. // Western officials had hoped Syria would cooperate , based on earlier pledges . But ' ' they seem to be digging in their heels ' ' on the PFLP-GC , a ranking US official says , and ' ' haven ' t done much to put the clamps on Jabril. ' ' // US specialists say this is a case where the client has a good deal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs a ' ' credible ' ' Palestinian in his alliance of hard-line groups opposed to Palestinian Liberation Organization ( PLO ) chief Yasser Arafat , they say . Mr. Jabril is noted for a streak of independence which makes him valuable to Assad , in contrast to other pro-Syrian Palestinians , such as Abu Musa , who are seen as puppets , they say . But ' ' that also makes him a very dangerous quantity , ' ' one specialist adds. // ' ' Assad theoretically has the leverage to reign Jabril in , ' ' says a well-placed official , ' ' but is he willing to use it ? ' ' Some US officials are also angered by what they suspect is Assad ' s quiet encouragement of the attempted cross-border attacks from southern Lebanon into Israel . Those attacks were launched by more radical factions of the PLO , while Mr. Arafat ' s Fatah faction has refrained from such actions since the US-PLO dialogue was agreed . ' ' Shouldn ' t we hold Syria responsible for actions emanating from territory they control ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the nascent US-PLO dialogue derailed . He also wants Arafat , a long-time enemy , discredited along with the more moderate Palestinian approach to Israel , say US officials and Arab diplomats in Washington. // Assad would also like to woo several of the more radical Palestinian factions now in the PLO back to his fold , they say . Finally , he is hesitant to further strain relations with Iran . At the same time , a top Arab diplomat in Washington adds , Assad feels diplomatically isolated . This is causing him to publicly play down criticism of Arafat. // ' ' In a way he ' s hostage of his debunked policies , ' ' the diplomat says . While the intifadah ( uprising ) has forced Arafat to rethink his policies , and the war with Iran has pushed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to take a more realistic position on Israel , Assad has not yet faced much pressure to change his basic outlook , he says. // Indeed , the diplomat adds , Syria ' s ' ' rejectionist ' ' approach has failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solution in Lebanon , to revive Syria ' s economy , to stop the return of Egypt to the Arab world , or to stop Arafat . The only thing it has done is to keep Syria a potential spoiler , he says. // Moscow is one source of pressure on Assad for change . The Soviet Union has been Syria ' s main patron and arms supplier . But the new Soviet thinking on the peace process has ' ' left Syria the odd man out ' ' says Galya Golan , director of the Soviet and East European Research Center at Hebrew University in Jerusalem . In an address on Soviet Middle East policy last week to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , Professor Golan pointed out that Assad is dissatisfied with Moscow ' s burgeoning relationship with Israel , its support for PLO moderation , and its push for a political solution to the Arab-Israel dispute . But there is no sign that Moscow intends to alter its course on Assad ' s behalf , she says. // Indeed , Moscow continues to signal that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategic parity with Israel . It recently appointed an ambassador to Syria known for his disagreement with Syrian policies. // A number of key policymakers in the Bush administration expect Assad to remain steadfastly opposed to a peace agreement even remotely acceptable to Israel and the US . While these officials do not advocate ignoring Syria , they suggest that Syria ' s opposition will need to be circumvented and blunted by building a coalition in favor of peace that can resist Syrian efforts to undermine it. // The current rough spot in US-Syrian relations follows a period in 1988 where the US tried to work with Syria to build a political settlement in Lebanon . Secretary of State George Shultz also regularly included Syria in his peace-process consultations last year . Many in Washington , however , came away from the failed Lebanon mediation effort feeling the US got burned , in good part because of Syrian intransigence . The US also found no Syrian flexibility on the Arab-Israeli peace process. // //                  @ @ @
