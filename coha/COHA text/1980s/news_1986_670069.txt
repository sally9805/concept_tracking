ATLANTA  --  For years , Delta Air Lines and its employees have had what they regard as a family relationship . But discount fare wars and deregulation have taken their toll on Delta ' s generosity and are putting some strain on the family . Delta wants wage and work-rule concessions from its pilots , whose contract expired last August , but attempts to negotiate a new pact have been futile . So far , no one considers the situation a crisis . A source at the Delta chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association still unashamedly talks of the " unique relationship in the Delta family , " and says the chance of a strike is " very remote . " Talk of family at Delta isn ' t just public relations . This is a company where three flight attendants started a campaign in 1982 that resulted in employees ' voluntarily purchasing a $30 million Boeing Co. 767 , after Delta had an unprofitable quarter . If a sick employee has used up his paid leave , Delta allows other employees to work for him so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a year of stalemated negotiations , neither side wants to talk on the record , for fear of exacerbating the un-Deltalike tension between management and pilots . But the impasse has hamstrung the expansion designs of the nation ' s sixth-largest airline at a time when major carriers are scrambling to expand their route systems . The frenzy of mergers and acquisitions in the industry are aimed at achieving the economies of scale believed necessary for survival in the current low-fare environment . And more than a few carriers are threatening inroads in Delta ' s southeastern U.S. stronghold . " Until we have a new contract , our growth plans are on hold , " concedes a Delta spokesman , who otherwise declines to discuss the negotiations . To a large degree , Delta ' s holding pattern is self-imposed . The carrier has long had a policy of expanding internally , rather than through acquisitions . After years of carefully avoiding union organizing  --  the pilots are the only large group of unionized Delta employees  --  it is loath to acquire another heavily unionized carrier . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rash of new flights and hiring new pilots at one of the highest pay scales in the industry . The average compensation for all Delta employees in 1985 , including benefits , was $49 , 852 , compared with the major-airlines average of $43 , 819 . Delta will find it difficult to make any expansion moves until it resolves its pilot pay rates , says John Pincavage , a PaineWebber Inc. analyst . " They need to get their contract squared with their pilots . " With its major competitors picking up routes amid the recent acquisitions and with Dallas-based AMR Corp. ' s American Airlines beginning to challenge Delta ' s largely eastern routes , Delta can little afford to stand still . American is developing hubs in Raleigh/Durham , N.C. , and Nashville , Tenn . " You either get bigger or you get smaller , " says Robert J. Joedicke , an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc . " The whole game is critical mass and control of traffic . " Mr. Joedicke also cautions that Delta ' s comfortable relationship with Miami-based Eastern Airlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the traffic at the busy Atlanta hub and haven ' t ever shown any inclination to battle over fares in that market . After Eastern ' s planned acquisition by discounted-minded Texas Air Corp. of Houston is completed as expected by this fall , that may change . Perhaps more important than challenges to its traditional turf is Delta ' s ability to carry passengers nationwide . Delta ' s routes saturate the eastern U.S. , but in the Rockies and West Coast regions they are sparse . As mergers give other carriers nationwide systems , Delta is likely to find it more difficult to control traffic even in its own back yard . Delta is particularly vulnerable if the industry institutes corporate discounts , Mr. Pincavage , the analyst , says . Under such a system , major corporations would contract with one or two carriers for substantial discounts in return for all of their business travel . " If that happens , you had better be pervasive , " Mr. Pincavage says . Without a stronger national route system , he says , Delta could be " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t reached a critical point , but it already has cost the carrier money . Industry sources estimate Delta lost as many as 40 , 000 passengers a month during the winter travel season because of its inability to expand capacity . The Delta spokesman acknowledges a loss of passengers . " Because of our failure to achieve a contract prior to moving into the busy winter season , we were unable to operate the already announced winter schedule , " he says . " This resulted in the cancellation of flights on which we had already made reservations for thousands of passengers . " Since January , Delta ' s 4 , 000 pilots  --  in accordance with their contract  --  have declined to work the three overtime flying hours a month that they routinely accepted previously . And the pressure on Delta promises to grow . The carrier is committed to adding at least 100 daily departures to its approximately 200 in Dallas/Fort Worth . In Cincinnati , Delta wants to triple its current 50 daily departures . Moreover , Delta plans an increased frequency of flights in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Tokyo-Portland , Ore. , connection . While those plans are flexible , Delta next January begins taking delivery of the first of 30 MD-88 aircraft from McDonnell Douglas Corp . It has options on an additional 50 MD-88s . It also is scheduled to receive five Boeing 767s and three Boeing 757s later this year . The purchases primarily were intended as additions to Delta ' s fleet , but if the carrier doesn ' t hire more flight crew personnel , the deliveries might force early retirement of other aircraft . The snag in the pilots negotiations has come as a surprise to Delta . From the company ' s point of view , the request for concessions was simply a bid to set a pay scale that already existed at most of its competitors . But while the talks have remained gentlemanly , frustration has surfaced on both sides . In the past few months , Delta has requested federal mediation , and the pilots replaced their entire negotiating committee . Those close to the negotiations say Delta ' s position has changed little since talks began a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacation and other benefits as well as a slightly heavier work schedule that will make its total compensation package about the same as that of other major carriers . Delta also wants a " B scale " or two-tier wage schedule that would allow it to pay new pilots at a lower rate . Other Delta employees already have B scales . Delta had a loss of $6. 4 million on revenue of $1. 11 billion in its third quarter ended March 31 , and union sources maintain that the pilots are willing to give Delta concessions . But the union argues the carrier ' s position isn ' t as reasonable as it might sound . They contend that concessions at other carriers resulted from financial disasters and that , in almost all cases , the concessions were traded for things like stock , profit sharing and board representation . " When Delta tells us what pilots at Continental or Eastern have done , our answer is , ' We ' ll talk to you about those things , but we also want to talk about those exchanges . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source says . So far , Delta hasn ' t been willing to talk about those exchanges , he adds . Two of the more sensitive issues appear to be flying time and the B scale , two areas that would make internal expansion considerably less expensive for Delta . Though the proposals are complex , basically Delta wants its pilots to fly more hours at the same pay . The pilots now fly about 75 hours a month , which requires them to be on duty about 250 hours a month . Most major carriers require pilots to fly between 75 and 80 hours a month . More contentious is the proposed B scale for new pilots . Though it exists at most other carriers , Delta ' s pilots so far have adamantly refused to budge on the issue . Despite these fundamental differences , the union doesn ' t appear ready to break from the tradition that has kept Delta free of major labor disruptions for its entire 57-year history . " We ' re willing to go further to hang onto that relationship , " a union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thing happening on the other side.
