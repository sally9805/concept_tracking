A view of Whitby . A moonlit night . MINA The room was dark . The bed was empty . I lit a match and found she was not there . The door was shut but not locked as I had left it . " Thank God , " I said to myself , " She can not be far , as she is only in her night-dress . " I ran downstairs and looked in the sitting room . Finally I came to the hall door and found it open . It was not wide open , but the catch of the lock had not caught . Lucy must have gone out as she was . I took a big , heavy shawl and ran after . There was a bright , full moon , with dense , black , driving clouds ; and the clock was striking one as I arrived at the Crescent . Not a soul was in sight . I ran along the North Terrace , but could see no sign of the white figure I expected . The entire harbor of Whitby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the edge of the West Cliff above the pier , I looked across the harbor to the East Cliff , in hope or fear  --  I do n't know which  --  of seeing Lucy at our favorite seat overlooking the town . For a moment or two I could see nothing , as the shadow of a cloud obscured Saint Mary 's Church and all around it . Then , as the cloud passed , I could see , there , just as I had expected , the silver light of the moon strike a half-reclining figure , snowy white . But it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind the seat and bent over it.What it was , whether man or beast , I could not tell ; I did not wait to catch another glance , but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by Gin Lane and the fish market to the bridge , which was the only way to reach the East Cliff . The town seemed dead , for not a soul did I see . That was good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembled , and my breath labored as I toiled up the endless steps . When I got to the top I could see the seat and the white figure . There was undoubtedly something long and black bending over her . Lucy ! Lucy ! Something raised its head . Offstage , VAMPIRETTES begin their vowel chant : " O , a , u.For a minute or so I lost sight of her . When I came into view again the cloud had passed , and the moonlight struck so brilliantly that I could see Lucy , quite distinctly , her head lying over the back of the seat . She was quite alone . Lucy is sleeping soundly now ; and the reflex of dawn is high and far over the sea . A bright light . p. 3 LUCY It all seemed quite real , for I knew I was not dreaming . I only wanted to be at this particular spot  --  I do n't know why , for I was afraid of something  --  I do n't know what . I do know I wanted to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though I suppose I was asleep , passing through the streets and over the bridge . A fish leaped as I passed by . And I heard a lot of dogs barking and howling , all barking at once , as I went up the steps . Then I had a vague memory of something long and dark with red eyes ; and something very sweet and very bitter all around me at once ; and then I seemed to be sinking into deep green water , and there was a singing in my ears , as I have heard there is to drowning men . My soul seemed to go out from my body and float about in the air . I seem to remember that , for a time , the West Lighthouse was underneath ; as if I had been thrown into the air . All I wanted was to be with you and Jack and Quincey and dear Professor Van Helsing . And then I came back and found you shaking my body . I saw you do it before I felt you .

She hears the dog bark ; She hears the water lapping ; She hears the ravings of the mad and understands .

This peculiar night has put me in mind of poor Jonathan , and the journal of his last , sad , strange , business trip . To the land beyond the forest LUCY To the land beyond the forest ? Whatever land beyond the forest* do you mean ? MINA You know which land , * Lucy . LUCY Why do n't you simply say " Transylvania " and be done with it ? MINA Lucy , you are so fractious since we arrived in Whitby , and your behavior in general has caused me no little vexation . LUCY Mina , must you dwell on morbid matters ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journal . Whitby is such a pleasant seaside town , if only you would let yourself enjoy it . The harbor is quite colorful , full of curious folk and quaint pleasures . It is our holiday , after all . MINA Lucy , how can you be so tactless ? LUCY Forgive me , Mina . I do n't wish to hurt you , really . It is only that I worry about you . Why must we be forever retelling the same old tale , as if the retelling of it might ease your torment ? Transylvania .

The wine was golden Mediasch , which produces a queer sting on the tongue , which is , however , not disagreeable . I had only a couple of glasses of this , and nothing else . We hear PEASANTS muttering . JONATHAN HARKER I could hear a lot of words , repeated . Queer words . I quietly got my polyglot dictionary from my bag and looked them out . I must say they were not cheering to me . Ordog ( Satan ) , Pokol ( hell ) , Stregoica ( witch ) , Vrolok , vlkoslak , both of which mean the same thing ; one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is either werewolf or vampire . p. 7 DRACULA Borgo Pass .

DRACULA I am glad that is old and big . We Transylvanian nobles love not to think our bones may lie among the common lot .

He calls himself " Scardanelli " and remembers nothing of his former life . Which is why it took us so long , with the aid of merciful God , to locate his loved ones . He was very thins and pale when we found him . Truly , the torments of the mad almost make one doubt the plan of God . Tears off her habit , throws it down , and tramples it . She sobs . MINA What could have produced such a violent effect on poor Jonathan ? Flashback to Castle Dracula . Foolish JONATHAN has gone to sleep in the wrong part of the castle . It is night , and three VAMPIRETTES appear in the dim light . They sing the song " Do you know where you are going , and what you are going to ? " ( repeat ) .

Lights up on the raving JONATHAN/SCARDANELLI as before . Now SEWARD has joined Mina . The NUN is gone . p. 12 MINA Dear Jack , what kind of sickness is this ? Sucked dry as a prune , with his poor wits wandering like the fabled antipodes of Saint Viar . Oh , Jonathan , poor Jonathan . Why does n't he recognize me ? DR . SEWARD Mina , it was wise of you to bring him here . Especially in view of our longstanding association . My asylum is the most up-to-date in this part of the country . My , your perfume makes me heady . I always was susceptible to odors , particularly female odors . No , this resembles some kind of absolute , bestial possession . As if  --  my God  --  the poor fellow had been terrified out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convincing , monstrosity . It happens , especially when there is a congenital weakness of the personality structure. * As I recall being the case with Jonathan . MINA What on earth do you mean by a " congenital weakness of the personality structure " ? DR . SEWARD Let us be frank with each other , Mina . Jonathan always was an odd duck . MINA But what can be done ? DR . SEWARD I know of only one man who can help us . He is an alienist and specialist of obscure maladies . My professor at Leiden , in fact . Van Helsing is his name . He resides at Amsterdam and , owing to a peculiar and private disability of an unmentionable sort , is reluctant to travel . p. 13 MINA Oh , dear . DR . SEWARD But that 's another matter . Without my assistance his renowned Atlas of the Rat 's Brain simply would not 've been possible. * But , perhaps , in this case , I may be able to prevail upon him. ** She exits .

VAN HELSING Let me tell you , my friend , that are things done today in electrical science which would have been deemed unholy by the very men who discovered electricity .

Can you tell why , when other spiders die small and soon , that one great spider lived centuries in the tower of the old Spanish church and grew and grew till , on descending , he drink the oil out of all the church lamps ? DR . SEWARD Whatever are you driving at ? VAN HELSING From your letter , I surmise this may be a special case . May I become level with you , John ? I have partially overcome my old fear of strange beds to come here . Who knows ? Maybe I can decipher ancient mystery . Show me the poor man . VAN HELSING examines JONATHAN . p. 14 DR .

SEWARD Then you want me not to let some previous conviction injure the receptivity of my mind regarding some strange matter . Do I read your lesson right ? VAN HELSING John , my friend . I am glad you call . This is not , I fear , normal mad . But unnatural one . Possession by dark forces of the forest . A virus of the undead . All signs indicate such . Vacant eye , like an empty wallet . Preposterous talk of wolf . Loss of memory of previous life : name , wife , solicitor 's trade . A complete big blank .

Brief DRACULA cameo. p. 15 VAN HELSING Wampyr . Is undead . Bloodsucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big , old tomes on such . In black mountains of Transylvania drunk Gypsies dance around the wooden red dog and shout horrible . Ordog ordog ordog ordog vlkoslak ! Rage in blood . Tell tale of aristocrat boyar warrior clan who fight Turk with strange mud pies , flying door-jambs , bloiling slime from wizard pot . Something go wrong in alchemical concoction . Instead of normal necromancy , a change happen to this certain nobleman . He become an effigy of marble smooth  --  white , blood-eating , invulnerable to storm , crossbow , or musket . Undead be born . Virus can not be traced to rotten meat , obscene sexual rite of autumnal haystack , nor the French itch . Maybe the devil have made this devil thing . DR . SEWARD What must we do ? VAN HELSING I am not prepare to say . Employ scientific method and hope for best . I have brought bottle of oude genever . Care for nightcap ? Wampyr can wait . He exits and SEWARD summons SIMMONS , who brings chloral . SEWARD takes some and leans back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern Morpheus ! I must be careful not to let it be a habit . But I am weary and low in spirits tonight . Perhaps all my research into the human brain has been for nothing . The expeditions to Peru , Tangiers , Mbululand . I am tired of everyone . This damnable itch to reason it all out , and be impartial . To judge what is sane , and what is not . When all I want to do is leap from the top of Saint Mary 's and flap to my death shrieking my hatred for all of them . Lucy , who would not have me , and Mina , who would not have me . And who both tempt me . As for the secret to mortal reason and mortal desire , how many brain smears have I examined and not found it ? And our poor damned " Scardanelli " says his God is near , but difficult to grasp . When everyone knows that God is far away and lives in the sky . There is no limit to mortal aggravation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cameo duo of LUCY and Mina la Fragonard. p. 16 MINA When Jonathan recovers the use of his faculties I shall be able to be very useful to him , and if I can stenograph well enough I can take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out for him on the typewriter , at which I am also practicing very hard . LUCY Mina , we have told all our secrets to each other since we were children . We have slept together and eaten together and laughed and cried together . And so now , Mina . Ca n't you guess ? Oh , Mina , I love him . And him . And him . Triple proposal cameo of SEWARD , VAN HELSING , and QUINCEY MORRIS.Well , my dear , number one came before lunch .

LUCY But he kept playing with a scalpel in a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only nine and twenty and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under his care. * Number two is Quincey Morris . He is an American with such a sweet accent , who has become frightfully rich importing scrap metal to Japan and Winchesters to Latin America . QUINCEY MORRIS Lucy , will you marry me ? LUCY And sweet old Professor Van Helsing , who has been consulting with Jack on some strange matter . So stable and strong p. 17 VAN HELSING Lucy , will you marry me ? LUCY Poor man , his wife lies in a coma near Amsterdam , a complete vegetable , due to a faulty innoculation during the recent outbreak of cholera in the Low Countries . Does that make his courting of me bigamy ? MINA Yes , he always did play with a scalpel . Oh , go on . Pause.It seems so important to keep a record of things . There is so little to hold on to otherwise . It all flies up the chimney . And what with Jonathan in the queer state he is in . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well know , it is Jack 's hospital where Jonathan is sequestered . And what with my weak stomach and all , Jack has absolutely forbade me from seeing him . LUCY You know what I did ? I told Dr. Seward I would not have him , but would have Quincey Morris instead . It was a fib , for I am very fond of Jack . But I was curious to see what he would do . He blushed , and his ears moved up and down ever so slightly . Then he gave out with the most curious moan . I know what you 're thinking , Mina : Why are men so noble when women are so little worthy of them ? Cross-fade to SEWARD and JONATHAN seated , facing each other . They smoke cigars , take notes , and mirror each other . JONATHAN HARKER I know what you 're thinking , Dr. Seward . " A strange and sudden change in Scardanelli last night .

I am usually respectful to servants . Even to him . Sometimes I am positively obsequious . But last night all I would say was : " I do n't want to talk to you . The master is at hand . " p. 18 DR . SEWARD ( In a sudden rage ) . What ? You do n't mean to tell me you do n't care about spiders anymore ? JONATHAN HARKER Bother them all ! I do n't care a pin about them . DR . SEWARD You are too dangerous to be roaming about . Up to now your hobby has been catching flies . You have had such a number I have had myself to expostulate . Then you turn your mind to spiders . You have got several big fellows in a box . You feed them with your flies , I know . Soon your spiders are as great a nuisance as your flies . I say you must clear out some of these . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloated with some carrion food , buzzes into the room . You catch it , hold it exultantly for a few minutes between thumb and forefinger , then , before I know what to do , you put it into your mouth and eat it . JONATHAN HARKER It was very good and wholesome . It was life , strong life . Life gives life . DR . SEWARD Then the tame sparrow incident . JONATHAN HARKER I tamed the sparrow by feeding it with spiders . And flies . DR . SEWARD Quite . That is the crux . JONATHAN HARKER My flies are considerably diminished , as you yourself requested , Dr. Seward . p. 19 DR . SEWARD Quite so . Indeed , you grow more interesting every day . JONATHAN HARKER But my sparrow is gone . It 's flown away . But a kitten ! A nice , little sleek , playful kitten . That is what I want . That I can play with , and teach , and feed and feed and feed and feed . DR . SEWARD The thought that has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theory proved . My maniac is of a peculiar kind . I shall have to invent a new classification for you . You are a zoophagous maniac . JONATHAN HARKER What the devil does " zoophagous " mean ? DR . SEWARD It means life-eating , you fiend . And what you desire is to absorb as many lives as you can , and you are scheming a plan to achieve this in a cumulative way . You give many flies to one spider , and many spiders to one sparrow , and now you want a cat to feed the sparrow to . BUT YOU YOURSELF HAVE EATEN THE SPARROW ! Slaps JONATHAN on the back : feathers fly.Men sneered at vivisection , yet look at its results today ! Why not develop science in its most difficult and vital aspect  --  the knowledge of the brains ? JONATHAN HARKER Shut up , Doctor . The master is coming . DR . SEWARD Had I the secret of even one such mind  --  the key to the fancy of one such lunatic  --  I might advance my own branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physiology of Ferrier 's brain knowledge would be as nothing . p. 20 JONATHAN HARKER Envy is a crippling affliction , Dr. Seward , and your obsession with brain matter smacks of rank determinism . DR . SEWARD What would you know of these higher things ? I do believe one day I shall locate the spot , the very lobe , governing sexual license , which may , by application of the galvanic charge , be rendered inoperable , giving us some peace at night . JONATHAN HARKER I only asked for a kitten . DR . SEWARD Ah , Lucy , how I wish you had forgiven me , for that day I spilled myself on your pretty pink skirt . It was beyond nature to control myself . Oh , Lucy , Lucy , though I have sat upon and crushed my hat I can not be angry with you , nor can I be angry with my friend Quincey Morris , that American ape , whose happiness is yours ; but I must only wait on , hopeless .

We must get to the bottom of this " wampyr " business . SIMMONS administers the opiate . JONATHAN becomes strange . p. 21 JONATHAN HARKER I am here to do your bidding , master . I am your slave , and you will reward me , for I shall be faithful . I have worshipped you long and afar off . Now that you are near , I await your commands , and you will not pass me by , will you dear master , in your distribution of good things ? They close in on him like tigers .

We could all go for an outing over the wold , or have a glorious dinner party . However , they lack savoir-faire . But today they 're all down to Whitby Harbor on some queer business .

VAMPIRETTES enter , make vampiric gesture and trail out . SEWARD and VAN HELSING enter and rush to her . DR . SEWARD My God ! This is dreadful . There is no time to be lost . She will die from sheer want of blood . VAN HELSING There must be transfusion of blood . DR . SEWARD I am younger and stronger , Professor . It must be me . VAN HELSING Then get ready at once . I have my bag . I must prepare . As they set up , QUINCEY enters . p. 29 QUINCEY MORRIS Lucy 's in a bad fix , I hear from Simmons . VAN HELSING Sir , you are in time . You are the lover of our dear miss . She is bad ; very , very , very bad . QUINCEY almost faints.Nay , my child , do not go like that . You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 'd give the last drop of my blood to save her . SEWARD becomes downcast . VAN HELSING You are a man , and it is a man that we want . LUCY ( Sitting up . ) What 's the matter with me anyhow ? VAN HELSING mixes a narcotic for her . Mina staggers in . VAN HELSING Now little miss , here is your medicine . Drink it off , like a good child . See , I lift you so that to swallow is easy . Pours it down her throat . VAN HELSING You may take that one little kiss while I bring over the table . Friend John , help me . They bring the table and avert their eyes so as not to see the kiss . Mina stares shamelessly.He is so young and strong of blood so pure that we need not defibrinate it . Your miss ( To QUINCEY. ) wants blood , and blood she must have or die . John was to give his blood ; but now you are here , and you are more good than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world of thought . Our nerves are not so calm and blood not so bright as yours . p. 30 QUINCEY MORRIS If only you knew how gladly I would die for her . VAN HELSING Good boy . Stabs him with the needle and exits . SEWARD takes chloral and staggers out into the hallway . Mina follows . A furtive copulation on the staircase . The transfusion continues and , elsewhere , SCARDANELLI sits in his cell , being mad . QUINCEY MORRIS Miss Lucy , I know I ai n't good enough to regulate the fixin 's of your little shoes . Wo n't you just hitch along-side of me and let us go down the long road together , driving in double harness ? LUCY I do n't know anything of hitching and such . And frankly , I find your interest in my shoes in somewhat bad taste . And as for the long road , I 'm not yet broken to harness . But I 'm eager to try He passes out from lack of blood.Shall we meet tonight behind the Black Dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor girls go when the heat seizes . But you must n't tell a soul . Promise ? Sees he 's passed out.Quincey , sometimes you are the very cipher of a man . Mina and SEWARD break off from their embrace . MINA Jack , may I ask a special favor ? I was wondering if I might see him again . Even if there 's little hope . My stomach is feeling a bit more stable now . It 's just that I must know more of his condition . p. 31 DR . SEWARD There has been little change . MINA Just once more DR . SEWARD He refers to himself as Scardanelli and says he possesses a master who is God and is near but difficult to grasp . Eats flies . Feeds them to spiders . Ate a bird once . A nice little sparrow that never hurt anyone . Another time he attacked me with a chair . I suffered a wound , here , upon the arm . It bled . Before that idiot Simmons could restrain him , he was on all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batty . His linen is most rank . Very well . It 's not as if he 's been kept prisoner . He enters JONATHAN 's cell.A lady would like to speak with you . JONATHAN HARKER Why ? DR . SEWARD She is going through the house and wants to see every-one in it . JONATHAN HARKER Oh , very well , let her come in , by all means . But wait just a minute till I tidy the place up . Eats all the flies and spiders.Let the lady come in . Sits down on the edge of the bed with eyes down and eyelids up . Ming enters . MINA Good evening , Mr. Scardanelli . JONATHAN HARKER You 're not the girl the doctor wanted to marry , are you ? You ca n't be , you know , for she is very ill. p. 32 MINA Oh , no ! I have a husband of my own . I am Mrs. Harker . Do you remember Jonathan Harker ? JONATHAN HARKER Ah , it was your husband , poor Jonathan , who was sucked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest . MINA We have had no word from my husband for some time now . But we would like to know where he is . JONATHAN HARKER Then what are you doing here ? MINA I am staying on a visit with Miss Lucy Westenra . JONATHAN HARKER Do n't stay . For the master is near and at hand . MINA We must find your master , for he has taken the soul of my dear husband , whose acquaintance you have surely made . You must surely recall the name Jonathan Harker ? JONATHAN HARKER Ah , yes , his father was the inventor of a burnt rum punch much favored on Derby Day . All they serve me here is mamaliga . MINA Do you recall the name Jonathan Harker ? You must try* very hard . DR . SEWARD Mina , it 's useless . JONATHAN HARKER Indeed , Mrs. Harker , do n't stay . It is perilous to be here when the moons creeps over the grass and stands before me in all her nakedness . Look at you ! Thin already , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 33 DR . SEWARD Mrs. Harker , it 's time for you to go . MINA Good-by , and I hope I may see you often , under auspices pleasanter to yourself . JONATHAN HARKER Good-by , my dear . I pray God I may never see your sweet face again . May he bless and keep you . She goes out and weeps . SEWARD follows and comforts her during the scene below between LUCY and SIMMONS . The former is still in bed , recovering from her transfusion . QUINCEY is gone . SIMMONS The master 's an odd duck , ai n't he ? Bet he 'd like to put his swizzle to you , and he 's not the only one either . Workin ' at this bloomin ' place 's makin ' me loony myself , I reckon . Master Jack 's a prig of the first water when ' e 's not gassed out on the old chloral hydrate , and that 's a fact . You want to play your Ishtar game in the garden tonight ? Your lovely Wilhelmina is always makin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continual regurgitation . And you know who 's got to clean up all that filth . Reliable old Simmons here . Why , me mates at the Black Dog call me the rare sot for putting up with the lot of ' em : mooncalves , naturals , bloody gooney birds , I swear . Lookin ' at you 's got me pecker up , I do declare . I 'm hot for a piece anytime , Miss Lucy . And that 's the long and short of it . And that old cheese-monger from Hamsterdom leaves a regular splotch of piss every time he plants his fat arse . It 's enough to make a bloke fly off his bloomin ' nut . JONATHAN , framed in the window of his cell , sings his song. @x Late twilight on the East Cliff overlooking Whitby . LUCY and QUINCEY sit at her favorite seat . Below , a reprise of the puppet show . LUCY Oh , I do feel so thin I barely cast a shadow . Do you know poor Mina throws up every day ? Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolting to be with her on these occasions . One must pretend not to notice . Her weak stomach must have something to do with the lamentable state of poor Jonathan . Quite changed , they say he is . Do you suppose he is still capable of love ? In the physical , gymnastical sense . Does n't look it , to be sure . Looks quite the shorn sheep . But I have heard from Simmons  --  you know Simmons ? Jack 's man ?  --  that the mad are sexually indefatigable . Very goats at it . He described to me quite remarkable feats of copulation among the idiot population of his previous place of employment : Lady Gresham 's Home for the Feeble Minded . It was no point to stop the poor dears . They would , if prevented during sensible hours , get to it , clandestinely , at night . Till the very floors creaked . The doctors tried strait-waist coats , but the poor dears would roar and howl so it was more than decency could bear . And , goodness knows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were quite clumsy and incapable of acquiring the simplest stitch  --  I am referring to needle-craft . The men absolute unlicked bears , lost to all possibility of Christian improvement . Simmons kept meticulous records of the more wonderful feats , the most appalling and exuberant lubricities . Simmons calls me Ishtar on our little walks over the wold . I make poor old Dr. Van Helsing do that , too . He turns red as a beet , but he does it . Do you know he is quite incontinent ? He must wear a sort of India-rubber night suit to avoid embarrassment . He calls it an attribute of a certain class of genius . Caesar . Alexander the Great . Willem the Silent . Bed-wetters all . That 's what dear Van Helsing has told me . I call him Bobo . Then he pretends to do an examination of me  --  all because of my dreams , my apparent anemia , and the irritation about my throat . Darkness . Pause . Wolf cries.Lately , I have been restless at night , Quincey . Very restless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simmons talks to me about the inmates at Lady Gresham 's . It seems quite an exasperation being a young girl and knowing one is not supposed to know certain things , and precisely the sorts of things one wants to know . Bonka bonka bonka bonk . More wolf cries . DRACULA alone in the sky . p. 36 DRACULA I am pure otherness . The ridiculous little sham of human conceit does not involve me . I am pure absence and am immune to the petty anxieties that trouble the shallow waters of humanity . I hear the music of other worlds and understand the deadly elegance of absolute nullity . He who opposes me becomes the fruit of my ceremonial banquet . I burn no bones before the altar of strange gods . I waste no blood in obscene and futile rites of propitiation . I am clean . I am honest . I do not suffer the inexact furies of the moving world . My dream is vast , empty , stationary , most cunningly articulated , infinitely mutable and transmutable . It was me and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have opened one inch the door of perpetuity , and slipped beyond , leaving behind on the doorstep of your civilization only the pathetic corpse of a dead rat . Nothing , absolutely nothing . For I am pure otherness . Blackout . Lights up on another transfusion for the unfortunate LUCY , who is near death . SEWARD and QUINCEY pace and fret . VAN HELSING breaks down . He raises his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair , then beats his palms together in a helpless way . Sits down on a chair and , putting his hands before his face , begins to cry , with loud , dry sobs . VAN HELSING God ! God ! God ! What have we done , what has this poor thing done , that we are so beset ? p. 37 DR . SEWARD What does it all mean ? I am beginning to wonder if my long habit of life among the insane is beginning to tell upon my own mind . VAN HELSING No . Today you must operate . I shall prepare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up sleeve . QUINCEY MORRIS Jack Seward , I do n't want to shove myself in anywhere where I 've no right to be ; but I love that girl . What is it that 's wrong with her ? The Dutchman said , another transfusion of blood . That both you and he were exhausted . Is that not so ? DR . SEWARD Then please do n't , you blithering idiot . Pause.That is so . What of it ? QUINCEY MORRIS I take it that both you and Van Helsing had already done what I did yesterday . Is that not so ? DR . SEWARD That 's what we 're tying to tell you , Quincey . QUINCEY MORRIS I guess Miss Mina was in on it , too . Four days ago she looked queer . DR . SEWARD Oh , shut up , Quincey , for God 's sake . QUINCEY MORRIS And how long has this been going on ? DR . SEWARD About ten days . What of it ? p. 38 VAN HELSING My friend John , be more calm . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not malign . Mina staggers in , looking strange . DR . SEWARD Oh , Quincey , you are an absolute cowboy ! If only you would pay attention , you might keep abreast . It is the work of a vampire . VAN HELSING The wampyr Dracula . QUINCEY MORRIS What 's a " wampyr " ? DR . SEWARD Vampire ! LUCY lifts her little finger in the vampiric gesture . Mina responds involuntarily . LUCY dies . All regard her with horror . VAN HELSING crosses himself as we hear the VAMPIRETTES ' chorus of " o , a , u . " VAN HELSING Just as at the scholomance high in the air over Lake Hermanstadt , the college of the undead . She is one of them now , God pity her . Cross-fade to the sky high above . VAMPIRETTES sing their song and dance . DRACULA flies up to join them . One turns to him .

Mina , SEWARD , QUINCEY , and VAN HELSING all hold wilted flowers . MINA Just like poor Jonathan , sucked dry as a pressed hibiscus . A moment of silence for Jonathan . Dirge continues as all exit . Pause . DRACULA and LUCY dance the " Silverton Polka . " Blackout . High on the East Cliff again . Gaslight . Mina and SEWARD sit in the twilight . DR . SEWARD Since our encounter , I have felt a strange new impulse , Mina . This monster , whatever he may be , has made me value my Christian soul the more . My days working with the twisted relics of lost reason have affected me , I fear . I must know if this thing truly exists . Van Helsing , I know , shall once more reap the recognition and rewards of our labors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot ; yet , perhaps , now , with the surety of your friendship , I can accept that lot . My father , you see , was a Hebrew , yes , a Hebrew of the Adelphi Theater type . All that that phrase projects into one 's brain : the Asiatic gown and fez , the greasy coin , the garbled injunction to buy cheap and sell dear ; these instincts I have sought to transcend , through good Christian fellowship . Quincey and his crew , etc . But I can not , I also confess , entirely escape my nature , even though it is other than I wish . Other than I do , in the bright days of my faith , deserve . p. 40 MINA Oh , Jack . DR . SEWARD So I shall , when this nasty business be done , take up the faith and seek out representatives of the Church of Latter-day Saints , so that , God willing , I may journey to Africa once more and convert the dark man , and cleanse his wounds . And all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " as Van Helsing says . A feeling I have not known since the old days at Mbululand . Pause.I do n't know , Mina . I really do n't know . MINA It somehow eases me to write it all in words . To record it all , simply or not so simply , in figures of speech . DR . SEWARD You 're a pretty figure of a girl , Mina . MINA Was I very wanton ? Pause.Oh , but Jack , you should n't have followed me . I came up here to be alone , for I am very sad . I miss Lucy , and I had hoped for so long that there was nothing permanently the matter with Jonathan . See the lights scattered all over the town , sometimes in rows where the streets are , and sometimes singly ; they run right up the river and die away in the curve of the valley . Over there the view is cut off by the black roof of the old house next to the asylum . Is n't it the place they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a harsh waltz , and farther along the qui it sounds like a Salvation Army meeting in the back street . Neither of the bands hears the other , but up here we can see and hear them both . It is like that with Jonathan . There are two of him . But all the time I wonder where the true , good , Christian soul of him is , and if he is thinking of me . I ca n't help it . I wish he were here . SEWARD shuffles about awkwardly.So I sit here thinking , thinking I do n't know what . Tolling bell . Wolf cries.I suppose I should try to get some sleep . Good night . She exits . Blackout . p. 41 DRACULA ( Singing . ) Dust : my friend.Fine , black sand.Old red plush of a coffinlid 's inside.Ten thousand years.Blood : my food.Old hats andcoats ago.Where am I ?

He forces her to drink " like a kitten . " She does so . DRACULA Flesh of my flesh , blood of my blood . Drink . Pause.Good . When my brain says " Come " to you , you shall cross land or sea to do my bidding . Cross-fade to padded cell . JONATHAN is in a pool of blood . SIMMONS discovers him . Rushes out and returns with SEWARD . SIMMONS I think , sir , his back is broken . See , both his right arm and the whole left side of his face are paralyzed . DR . SEWARD Go and fetch Quincey , and send for Van Helsing . SIMMONS I ca n't understand two things . He could mark his face like that by beating his own head on the floor . I saw a young woman do it once at Lady Gresham 's before anyone could lay hands upon her . Bloody waste that was , as she was a rare piece . And I suppose he might have broke his neck by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkward kink . But for the life of me ! If his back was broke , he could n't beat in his head ; and if his face was like that before his fall p. 42 DR . SEWARD I think that will do for now , Simmons VAN HELSING and QUINCEY enter . QUINCEY MORRIS My God , what happened to him ? VAN HELSING There is no time to lose . His words may be worth many lives . It may be that a soul is at stake . DR . SEWARD We shall operate above the ear . Applies a brace and bit to JONATHAN 's head . JONATHAN HARKER I 'll be quiet , Doctor . I have had a terrible dream . And it has left me so weak that I can not move . DR . SEWARD Go on . VAN HELSING Tell us your dream , Scardanelli . JONATHAN HARKER All day I waited to hear from him , but he did n't send me anything , not even a blowfly . He promised : " All these lives I will give to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " But he came for her , for when she came to visit me this afternoon she was n't the same . VAN HELSING You are referring to Miss Lucy ? VAMPIRETTES ' vowel chorus . JONATHAN HARKER No , I am talking about Mrs. Harker . She reminded me of someone . A face from long ago . Before I discovered fright in the dark interstices of the Borgo Pass . No , I must be mistaken . I know nothing of solicitors and their pretty wives . I like people with plenty of blood in them . Groans.So when he came tonight from Carfax I was ready for him . I have heard that madmen have unnatural strength ; and as I knew I was a madman  --  at times anyhow  --  I resolved to use my power . He felt it , too , for he had come out of the mist to struggle with me . He slipped through it , and , when I tried to cling to him , he raised me up and flung me down . p. 43 DR . SEWARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this house . They let JONATHAN drop to the floor , and then rush to her door . QUINCEY MORRIS Should we disturb her ? DR . SEWARD We must . If the door is locked , we must break it in . They bang on the door.Mina , are you doing something in there you do n't want us to see ? She opens the door , her face covered with blood . MINA I was sleeping , Jack . DR . SEWARD In God 's name , what does this mean ? JONATHAN HARKER ( sings his swan song . ) " There is hair growing into my head , " etc . The MEN join him for a chorus . He moans and dies . MINA He 's dead . VAN HELSING God 's will be done . LUCY suddenly appears , lifts her little finger . Mina responds involuntarily . QUINCEY faints dead away . LUCY Come with me , Jack . I want to kiss you and comfort you in my arms . Come and we can rest together . MINA ( As in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " You may as well know it is not the first or the second , time . " And then he began to do it , and I felt my strength fade away . p. 44 DR . SEWARD Is this really Lucy 's body or only a demon in her shape ? VAN HELSING It is her body , yet not it . LUCY Oh , Jack , my love . I 'm so glad to see you . I have seen things you would never believe . I have flown over London and Whitby . I can see through your eyelids into your brain ; I can see what you are thinking . You are so unhappy in this place . Come with me . I have always loved you best .

Pause . p. 45 DRACULA You think to baffle me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like calves ' heads in a butcher shop . You think you know who I am . But my name is TREMENDOUS . Ask your friend . Ah , where is poor Jonathan ? JONATHAN HARKER ( In a ghostly cameo . ) He is no more . For he straddled two worlds , and for his arrogance was torn apart . He vanishes . DRACULA Scardanelli ! Would he had drunk the dark wine of eternity and joined us who simply ARE . The MEN advance on him. I must speak clear . England , with its sedgy pathways and stone fences , pleases me not . The blood is poor here , and I confess to a distaste for the bowler hat , which is such a passion in these parts . Miss Lucy Westenra He throws her to them.You may have her , but you must not interfere with our departure . Gestures grandly . LUCY blanches in horror.The warlike days are over .

If you must know , it is there me and my kin are journeying . America ! Aboard the steamer Paducah . The crew is fat and flushed with blood . But you are a peasant . Die like one . I go now . He and VAMPIRETTES warily begin to withdraw . p. 46 LUCY You must not forsake me . I have given up everything , my honor , my faith , my people , my blood , my very life . All for you .
