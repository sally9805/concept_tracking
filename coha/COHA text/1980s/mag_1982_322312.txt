John Paul 's gamble pays off ; next high-risk stop : Argentina <P> During his six-day pastoral visit to England , Scotland and Wales that ended last week , Pope John Paul II evoked the sobering specter of modern warfare at nearly every stop . To a Britain at war , the Pope offered a vision of peace-of the inviolable worth and dignity of every soul on earth . At an open-air Mass , he told 300,000 cheerful but attentive listeners that , if unleashed , society 's war machines today would make even the destruction of World War II pale in comparison . He spoke near the most renowned landmark in Coventry , England : the remnant of the bombed-out Anglican cathedral , left standing as a perpetual reminder of the horrors of war . The Pontiff painted a chilling picture of " people . . . under the shadow of a nuclear nightmare . " <P> Clearly alluding to the old-style battle that was moving toward a final denouement on the Falkland Islands , he said , " Today the scale and horror of modern warfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a means of settling differences between nations . War should belong to the tragic past , to history . " <P> In fact , war had almost dashed the Pope 's hopes for his pastoral and long-awaited trip to Britain . But John Paul , overruling the caution of close advisers , would not let war prevent his mission of peace . In the end it was clear that the Pope 's judgment had been sound and his trip a phenomenal triumph . Under uncharacteristically sunny skies and warm ecumenical dispositions , the pretrip jitters about security and the ticklish wartime atmosphere quickly subsided . Britons took no perceptible offense at the Pope 's plan to fly to Argentina this Friday , though perhaps he should anticipate some British grumbling when he shakes the hand of General Leopoldo Galtieri , with whom he is expected to meet . A session with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had been canceled to point up the nonpolitical nature of the Pope 's British tour . <P> Though some crowd turnouts were smaller than anticipated , 1.9 million Britons attended the papal events , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first visit in history of a Pope to Britain . John Paul II pulled off a kind of diplomatic and personal coup that should move forward the cause of Christian unity , if not world peace . Many who viewed the Pope 's impressive performance were struck by his simplicity , straightforwardness and warmth . <P> Into crowds of massed enthusiasm , John Paul plunged with a tactile directness , grasping hands , reaching out to hug and kiss infants with a touch that was at once firm and paternal . Through 15-hour day upon 15-hour day , the Pope persevered , both visibly wearied by the self-imposed ordeal and rejuvenated by the obvious stir he was creating . Said one member of the Pope 's entourage : " He is a good dash man but not a miler . He gets awfully tired after a sprint . But the crowd scenes and the youth meetings seem to inject adrenaline into his veins . " Concluded Glasgow Catholic Archbishop Thomas Winning : " This was his hardest mission . The British are a phlegmatic people , yet he captured them completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
