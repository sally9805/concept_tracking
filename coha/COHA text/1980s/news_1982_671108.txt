Despite rules designed to suppress debate , they ended their national conference with more to say on issues than " Reagan is unfair , " though that theme came through insistently . From the newness of the nuclear freeze concept , an idea their 1980 convention rejected out of hand , to the traditionalism of anti-recession public works jobs proposals , dressed up with the novelty of rebuilding old bridges rather than constructing new ones , they answered the charge that they can only carp . <> <> Two Choices for 1984 // They left , as they arrived , with two leading choices for their 1984 Presidential nomination , Senator Edward M. Kennedy and former Vice President Walter F. Mondale , but with more reasons to be happy with both men than they had come with. // Mr. Mondale , with more to prove , proved it . He made a superior speech to an audience of 897 political professionals who came here wanting to like him but feeling skeptical. // Mr. Kennedy showed that he has more to offer than emotional oratory and can hold an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speechmaking with quality staff work off the convention floor . <> <> Conciliation vs . Doctrine // Most unusual of all , Democrats went home from a national meeting with the novel experience of finding that they could discuss issues they care about deeply without bitterness . They behaved as if they thought that conciliation can be more valuable in politics than pure doctrine. // Their successful search for unity was also measured in symbols , most ironically when the only standing ovation offered for the absent former President , Jimmy Carter , came when he was praised for his human rights policies by Senator Kennedy , his 1980 rival. // This conference was not marked by strident calls to arms . There was no oratorical high point to match Mr. Kennedy ' s exhortation at the 1978 meeting in Memphis that " Sometimes a party must sail against the wind . " His speech , and Mr. Mondale ' s , were well spoken and carefully written , with strong phrasing but no memorable lines for future anthologies . <> <> Nuclear Freeze a Main Theme // But the session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freeze issue , hedged with a commitment to a goal of parity between the United States and the Soviet Union to keep the party ' s hawks on board , still held emotional center stage throughout and commanded one of the louder of the 57 interruptions for applause Mr. Kennedy received today. // The other dominant theme , as Mr. Mondale put it first on Friday , was that the Democrats are quite different from what they see on the other side of the political fence , that " in Reagan ' s America , there is apparently no room for women. " // Again and again , in most major speeches , and in the issue statements , the Democrats showed they had room for women ' s issues , especially the dying equal rights proposal. // And they had room for women to play key roles in debates and negotiations as the party hammered out its statements on issues it expects to tackle for 1982 . <> <> Other Events Overshadowed // If the Democrats had one major disappointment , it was that other events , especially Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from dominating television news coverage as they had hoped. // But Gene Eidenberg , director of the Democratic National Committee , said he felt the Democrats in the hall were the most important audience , a group that had to be convinced they were a " viable national political party " before they could convince the public. // Mr. Eidenberg said he left convinced that this National Party Conference , which many Democrats approached either with trepidation or with the belief that it would not be worth its $300 , 000 cost , had accomplished that effort. // Representative Bill Alexander of Arkansas , one of the dozens of Democratic officeholders enticed to the conference by the assurance it would be constructive and unlike the strife-torn meeting in Memphis in 1978 , agreed . He said he had not been disappointed. // Mr. Alexander said he discerned a " tone of moderation " and a realization by the party that " there are not enough poor people in America today to win a national election with their votes . " <> <> Impressive Mondale Showing // But for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the first authorized display of the 1984 Presidential hopefuls . And no one left Philadelphia more satisfied with their accomplishments here than Mr. Mondale and his followers. // Mr. Mondale was impressive . " The best speech I ever heard him give , " said Gov . William Winter of Mississippi . " He moved them . " The same sentiments came again and again from party professionals. // The other Friday speakers did themselves no harm , but no obvious good , either . Senators Alan Cranston , Gary Hart , John Glenn and Ernest F. Hollings left the podium in the second rank , where they were when they got there. // And then there was Mr. Kennedy . The insiders focused on the importance to Mr. Mondale of his success on Friday , when he scored 27 interruptions for applause and seven breaks for cheers , while frequently neglecting to note that Mr. Kennedy was interrupted 57 times for applause and 31 times for cheers. // A less professional critic , Frank Huber , a retired electrical worker from Prospect Park , Pa. , said Friday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " referring to the late Senator and Vice President , Hubert H. Humphrey , who was Mr. Mondale ' s mentor in Minnesota politics. // Today Mr. Huber said , " Kennedy was more forceful . " A weekend of speeches will not pick the 1984 nominee . But they reaffirmed the implications of the polls and the judgments of the pols : Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Mondale are in the front rank and the others follow. //
