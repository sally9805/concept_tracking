Some see it as a way of filling the ranks of the military at a time when the pool of new 18-year-olds is shrinking . Others regard it primarily as a way to foster a work ethic while meeting the nation 's domestic needs : restoring parks , cleaning up inner cities , repairing roads , caring for the elderly , tutoring children . Proponents of the idea still disagree as to what extent the program should be mandatory or voluntary . Yet there is growing talk these days among politicians of various stripes about instituting in the U.S. some form of national service , a program that would recruit or draft young people for a year or so , allowing them to choose military or civilian work . " We have to try to instill a sense of service in the country , " says Morris Janowitz , a sociologist at the University of Chicago . <P> Democratic Congressman Robert Torricelli of New Jersey plans to introduce this week the most comprehensive national-service plan yet : a bill that would draft all American men and women ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the military or approved civilian projects . Oklahoma Democrat Dave McCurdy will submit a proposal for a voluntary program that would require applicants for federal college loans to spend a year in national service first . Neither of the bills is likely to pass in this session . But they will help stimulate a debate that has been under way since the draft was abolished in 1973 . <P> Reform-minded Democrats have been at the fore of the cause . " A new system of national service , " says Presidential Hopeful Gary Hart , " will ask young Americans to return some of the advantages and investments they have received ; from our society . " The Democratic Leadership Council , an organization headed by former Virginia Governor Charles Robb , has endorsed the notion as a way to " foster a new spirit of citizenship and patriotism . " <P> A primary concern of the national-service supporters is the " baby-bust generation " and its effect on the military . In 1980 , 2 million young men reached their milestone 18th birthday . By 1986 the number was down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped to 1.6 million . Says a Democratic Leadership Council report : " The coming manpower pinch will make it difficult to maintain the current quality and size of the all-volunteer force without driving up its already considerable cost . " Pentagon officials argue that the all-volunteer force has had no trouble getting quality recruits or controlling costs . <P> There are some state-level models for the civilian component of a national- service plan , most notably the California Conservation Corps . Created in 1976 , it currently enlists 2,200 young men and women in a twelve-month program that includes fighting floods and forest fires , maintaining parks and clearing streams . The pay starts at $580 a month . The conditions often feature military-style barracks in isolated areas . At the end of a tour of duty , corps members are eligible for a $500 cash bonus or a $1,000 scholarship . For many workers , the program offers an escape from broken families , bad neighborhoods and the self-centered apathy that afflicts many young people today .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
