Under normal circumstances , such a condescending link between the brilliant , controversial husband and the second-best wife would be outrageous and offensive , especially to a writer with Ms. Wiggins ' s feminist concerns . But Ms. Wiggins was amused and cheered when she phoned from her guarded hiding place last Friday and heard that story from Terry Karten , her editor at Harper &; Row . Her reaction seems a small symbol of how abnormal every event surrounding " The Satanic Verses " has become. // When Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ' s death threat against Mr. Rushdie sent him and Ms. Wiggins into hiding two weeks ago , her identity seemed to vanish under the neat and nearly anonymous formula used to describe her : Salman Rushdie ' s wife , the American novelist Marianne Wiggins . For most people , that bland shorthand evokes the barest trace of curiosity . Who is Marianne Wiggins ? Is she anyone I should know ? // // All-but-Forgotten Victim // It turns out that she is a woman whose childhood was shaped by religious conservatism , which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary career , which was about to be given a huge push with her new novel , has been abruptly halted , her own book promotion tour canceled . She is a United States citizen who has scarcely been mentioned in public statements by the American writers ' groups that have rallied to support her husband . The controversy , of course , surrounds Mr. Rushdie and not his wife . Yet Ms. Wiggins , whose life and career have been altered as irrevocably as her husband ' s , seems the all-but-forgotten victim in " The Satanic Verses " debacle. // Her life with Mr. Rushdie is relatively new . They met when she moved to London four years ago , and they married in January 1988 . The 41-year-old author ' s pre-Rushdie life had its own American version of cultural drama . She was grew up in Lancaster , Pa. , where her father failed as a farmer and eventually committed suicide . When Ms. Wiggins was a child , every Sunday her father would preach in a conservative Christian church founded by her grandfather. // It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a Bible-beating , reactionary kind of church , " called " the first Church of Christ Salvation or some long thing like that . " When she was 9 , Ms. Wiggins was baptized into the Greek Orthodox religion of her mother . " I left those wooden pews for rooms full of icons and incense and men in robes , " she said . <> <> Charting the Surface // It would be years , however , before organized religion turned up in her fiction as the great evil . Until " John Dollar , " Ms. Wiggins ' s writing closely charted the surface , though not the depths , of her own life and times . After an early marriage and divorce - Ms. Wiggins has a grown daughter - she worked as a stockbroker in the early 1970 ' s . When her first novel , " Babe , " appeared in 1976 , she and her daughter moved to Martha ' s Vineyard , where she turned out two more novels - " Went South " and " Separate Checks " - and a highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They constitute one long , wry , savvy look at motherhood , divorce and contemporary women in love. // " Separate Checks , " published in 1984 , is a profuse , cockeyed look at three generations of women in one family . Their stories are written from a psychiatric hospital by the heroine , whose mystery-writer mother has named her Ellery McQueen . Ms. Wiggins tweaks religion in her title , which Ellery lifts from a Mel Brooks movie . ( A waiter at the Last Supper : " Are you all together or is this going to be on separate checks ? " ) And Ellery offers two theories why there are no men in her stories . " The first is that males born into our family were exposed at birth ; and the second theory is we ate them . " These jokes have their serious comeuppance in " John Dollar .

" Ms. Wiggins ' s most ambitious and accomplished novel , it is a lyrical and effectively savage critique that means to undermine some foundations of Western civilization - patriarchy , imperialism , colonialism and the rituals of Christianity . Though it is possible to see Mr. Rushdie ' s influence in these huge cultural themes , " John Dollar " is as spare as Mr. Rushdie ' s work is extravagant. // The novel , whose working title was " Eucharist , " is replete with mock sacraments , as John Dollar , the symbol of British male supremacy , becomes the girls ' false god . They bathe him in wine ; they place white quinine tablets on his tongue . Two small girls - one of them a minister ' s pious daughter - eat his flesh , shaving off bits of his leg in a daily religious ritual . In an interview published not long before Mr. Rushdie ' s life was threatened , Ms. Wiggins told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimate taboo masked in all our religious rituals , particularly Christianity , the body of Christ , taking the bread and wine . The men who thought up religion knew exactly what they were doing , playing on people ' s deepest fears . " <> <> A Large First Printing // Ms. Wiggins ' s novel is far less explosive than Mr. Rushdie ' s , though . Her iconoclasm seems bound to its historical moment , safely tucked away in the past ; and it is the sort of critique of institutional religion that Christians have heard often enough. // Although the cannibalism is too extreme a symbol , " John Dollar " soars beyond the deft but shallow observations of Ms. Wiggins ' s earlier works . One of the many oddities of her current position is that her most artistic novel - which happens to be short , accessible and ultimately shocking - is being pitched as her most commercial . Long before " The Satanic Verses " erupted into a political crisis , Harper &; Row was planning a campaign it hoped would make " John Dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 000 copies , much more than usual for a little-known novelist , and planned advertising and a seven-city tour that was to have begun yesterday . There was no hint of exploiting Mr. Rushdie ' s acclaim . In both " John Dollar " and " The Satanic Verses , " the single clue to the Wiggins-Rushdie marriage comes on their neatly cross-referenced dedication pages : hers reads " for beloved Salman " and his " for Marianne . " <> <> Too Soon to Tell // It is too soon to know how well " John Dollar " will sell . Though Ms. Wiggins ' s name is in the news , early sales have not been exceptional . Reviews have offered restrained praise , not the kind of wild enthusiasm that sells books. // When American writers had a reading last Wednesday to support Mr. Rushdie , Ms. Wiggins sent a written statement through her agent , Andrew Wylie , which was read by Susan Sontag . In a tone both doomed and defiant , the statement said in part that writers " are a dangerous breed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words can emanate from silence , words can find their way from hidden places . " Though those words made their way through the security network guarding Mr. Rushdie and his family , Ms. Wiggins declined to be interviewed by phone. // The death threat against her husband has already changed Ms. Wiggins ' s career . A collection of stories called " Learning Urdu , " scheduled to appear next year , will have a title less " pregnant with significance , " said Ms. Karten , her editor . And the author has had to halt work on a nonfiction book about bullfighting . She had planned to visit Spain in April and spend the winter of 1990 following matadors through Latin America . No one can guess when Ms. Wiggins will again be free to research such a book. //
