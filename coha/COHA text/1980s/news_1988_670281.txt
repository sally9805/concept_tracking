New York  --  Richard Ericson was my Professor Henry Higgins , and I like to think that I was his Fair Lady . Or at least one of them . He taught me to fake an Irish accent . He also was responsible for Michelle Pfeiffer ' s New Yorky yowl in the current film hit " Married to the Mob . " Mr. Ericson can show almost anybody how to sound like somebody else . When he spreads his lips in a tight smile , looks down his nose , and says " o , " what emerges from his mouth is the word " oh " as an upper-crust Londoner might pronounce it . And if you ' d rather hear a Cockney , a Frenchman or a Southerner , Mr. Ericson can oblige you . He is a dialect coach , one of a handful of specialists who teach actors how to do the accents they need for a particular part . He ' s helped Albert Finney sound American , Joel Grey sound Korean and Lisa Bonet sound Cajun . He ' s helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of Aborigine actors tone down theirs  --  for the same play . Ms. Pfeiffer was his latest laryngeal makeover as Angela Demarco , the Mafia widow . Mr. Ericson describes Ms. Pfeiffer ' s normal sound as " California breathy , very NICE . " For the movie , she needed to be New York nasal , and VULGAH , not NICE . " When we started working together , " recalls Mr. Ericson , " she already had a lot of it . With someone that good , you just edit , and you help to encourage everything she ' s already doing right . " Four or five sessions were enough to change her " YEAHNjuhluh duhMAHko " to the more accurate " YEAHNjuhluh duhMAWko . " " That AW is a very hard sound for non-New Yorkers to hear , " says Mr. Ericson . " DuhMAWko . " Each time he repeats the AWE , his shoulders jerk forward a little for emphasis . It ' s no accident , he says . It ' s a Noo Yawk kind of shrug . " An accent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just what comes out of your mouth . It ' s the way you use your face , your body . There ' s a whole culture that goes into a dialect . " Indeed , Mr. Ericson seems to turn into someone else each time he demonstrates another accent . One minute , he ' s a twinkly Irish leprechaun , the next a hearty Aussie . Speaking high British , his jaw tightens and his face takes on a distinct reserve ; doing a French accent , his chin slackens , his lips purse and he looks a bit jaunty . It ' s no surprise to discover that he found his profession while studying to become an actor at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh . As the son of an American diplomat , he ' d grown up in Japan , Korea and England , hearing a multitude of accents , foreign and foreign-service American . And he became fascinated by the variety of sounds that could be used to produce the English language . ( His own sound is an unplaceable , standard American . ) Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You can do better , " the teacher told him . The teacher was right , although Mr. Ericson , now 34 years old and fully adept , tries not to throw his erudition around when he coaches actors . " If you present an actor with a phonetics chart , he or she will get very intimidated , " he says . " Dialect becomes a mathematical science instead of a tool they need to create a role . If you make an actor self-conscious about it , what you ' ll get is a dialect , not a performance . I try to make actors comfortable by talking their language , instead of being a Professor Higgins . " In fact , he says , Professor Higgins might easily find fault with his results . " If the performance is good , " he says , " the dialects are rarely going to be perfect . It ' s the illusion we deal in . " Besides , he says , there is no such thing as a " perfect " dialect . " No one who speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another speaker . Two people who grow up on the same block are still going to hear different influences as kids . And each one will pick out what suits his ear and his gut , and that ' s how he ' s going to talk . I ' ve heard New Yorkers who say ' kaul ' ( for call ) in one breath and ' tok ' ( for talk ) in the next , even though those two As should sound the same . " In teaching actors how to pretend they have accents , he finds what he calls " a key phrase " that " epitomizes the dialect and the characterization . " For high British , it ' s always , " Oh , no "  --  or " oew noew . " Sometimes , it ' s a line from the script . In at least one instance , it was a common but unprintable command that was honed into a guttural snarl . Sometimes , Mr. Ericson admits , he has to teach himself a dialect first , as when Washington ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a play set in Belfast . " Northern Irish , " he says , " sounds completely different from Southern Irish . It ' s a compilation of Scots , Norse and Southern Irish sounds . And some sounds are distinctly Northern Irish sounds . The words ' my wife , ' for example , down south would be ' moi woif ' ; up north , they say ' may wayf . ' " Mr. Ericson picked up the dialect by spending time with a Belfast-born bartender he met at an Irish cultural center . And he flew the fellow down to Washington with him so that the Arena actors could meet him also , and watch him talk . " So much of his speech was colored by the way he held himself , the way he never raised his voice . In Northern Ireland , they speak as if they ' re always looking over their shoulders . " Mr. Ericson ' s students don ' t just watch body language . They are taught to use it . Trying to give me a bit of an Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fist as I said " tough , " or , as a Dubliner would say , " toof , " so that my breath stopped a bit short as the word ends . I spent a few minutes practicing my key phrase , " Paay the BOHTmn , GOH . " Mr. Ericson encouraged me to exhale on my aays and ohs . " It ' s a sound that has the breath o ' the world in it , " he said . Then he added the word " now " to my drill , making it sound more like " na . " " Think o ' the keenin ' , wailin ' sound the Irish make , " he says , and he moans : " Ooooh . " " Add to it the smell o ' the ocean  --  a bit o ' saltiness . " " Paay the BOHTmn , GOH na . " Eventually , echoing Professor Higgins , he says , " You ' ve got it . But don ' t open your mouth so much . " One of the reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must control an irresistible urge to giggle as it makes these utterly foreign sounds . Mr. Ericson is not surprised . " This is play , " he says . " It ' s one of the reasons I love what I do . " ( It hasn ' t prevented him from pursuing some sidelines , such as theater producing . But that ' s another story . ) When Mr. Ericson tried to teach me the soft Irish R  --  he avoided the hard , rolled R because , he said , " It throws you right into Scots "  --  he told me to put the tip of my tongue at the top of my mouth and add some nasal resonance . I didn ' t get it , and he went on to my lesson in Irish lilt . He sang , " You are , you are , you are , you are " to a descending scale , and , when I tried it , he beamed . " There , " he said , " you got the R. " Harder than teaching people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then teaching them to de-emphasize it . " With any accent , it ' s what you throw away that creates the rhythm pattern , that makes the important things important . A lot of bad accents happen when actors give every syllable equal stress . " I was throwing away my ehs and uhs and ahs with ease ; I was trilling away , accenting my aays and ohs and working on those Rs . Imagining myself passing for a Dubliner by next week , I asked Mr. Ericson how many lessons I ' d need in order to fool a native with my budding brogue . He let me down gently . " Nationals are pretty hard to fool , " he said . " Because it ' s not just an accent , it ' s an idiom . And it ' s not just the words you choose to say , but the interjections , the things you say between the words . The very best people at this  --  Meryl Streep , for example  --  could probably fool nationals . But Meryl Streep doesn ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs my help could fool a native speaker . " Aw , shucks.
