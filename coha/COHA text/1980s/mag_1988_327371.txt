South African Foreign Minister Roelof ( " Pik " ) Botha dips into his private stock of witblits ( white lightning ) , a fiery homemade liqueur distilled from the berries of the wild marula tree , only on special occasions . So it was a sign of the heady mood in Brazzaville , the capital of Congo , that Botha broke out the good stuff last week . Botha and his fellow negotiators , who included U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker , Angolan Armed Forces Chief of Staff General Antonio dos Santos Franca and Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada , were celebrating the signing of a historic protocol calling for independence for Namibia and the withdrawal of all Cuban troops from Angola . " A new era has begun , " proclaimed Botha , who used the moment to strike a conciliatory note toward South Africa 's neighbors . " We want to be accepted by our African brothers . We need each other . " <P> The treaty , which will be formally signed this week in New York City , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops . It also sets April 1 as the trigger date for the implementation of U.N . Resolution 435 , which calls for Namibian independence and for supervised elections in the onetime German colony . The deal , delicately linking interests among all the participants , promises an end to two long-running conflicts : it caps the 13 years of hostilities between South Africa and Cuban-backed Angolan forces , and it clears the way for a cease-fire in the 22-year-old war between the Angolan-based guerrillas of the South West Africa People 's Organization and South African forces . <P> The agreement elicited warm praise from Cuba , Angola and the U.S. , which sees the protocol as the fruit of nearly eight years of artful , arduous negotiation by Crocker  --  helped along toward the end by the new spirit of cooperation between Washington and Moscow . U.S. officials credit the Soviets for employing " cajolery and arm-twisting " that made the Cubans and Angolans more flexible , particularly during the crucial round of talks at which a withdrawal timetable was worked out . SWAPO welcomed the accord but expressed doubts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's keeping its word after signing the agreement in New York , said a SWAPO official , is the " vigilance of the Namibian people . " <P> South Africa , for its part , is concerned that the Cubans may find a way to avoid living up to their end of the bargain . Despite a stipulation in the Brazzaville protocol that Cuba and Angola will reach an agreement on verification arrangements subject to U.N . Security Council approval , Botha has pushed strongly for guarantees that no Cuban troops will remain in Angola after the deadline . The Brazzaville agreement also did not address the continued presence in Angola of bases manned by anti-South African fighters of the African National Congress . <P> Another obstacle to peace may be Jonas Savimbi 's forces . Since 1975 , Savimbi 's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( UNITA ) , with U.S. and South African backing , has been waging guerrilla actions against the Marxist MPLA Angolan government . Savimbi has vowed that there will be no peace in Angola until he and his political movement become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " warned UNITA spokesman Alcides Sakala , " we will intensify our struggle , we will continue the war .
