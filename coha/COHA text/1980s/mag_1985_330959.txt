Though the role might have winded any singer , Luciano Pavarotti easily sustained the ringing high notes , the plaintive appoggiaturas , the hummingbird runs and trills . Not his own , but those of 150 hopeful young singers . Bespectacled and wrapped in a colorful shawl , the celebrated tenor spent the past two weeks judging the finals of the second Opera Company of Philadelphia/ Luciano Pavarotti International Voice Competition . " If you win this competition , " said Pavarotti at the outset , " it promises you an opportunity . But more important , if you do not win , it does n't mean you will not have a career . " Still , the expansive Italian could not designate many losers . The day the competition ended , Pavarotti celebrated with an early cake for his 50th birthday and announced he had decided on 54 winners . There is more winnowing yet to be done , however ; only some will get to sing with him in upcoming Philadelphia productions . " They are all scared to death , " he said .
