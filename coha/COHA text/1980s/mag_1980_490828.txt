THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment SINCE the end of the Second World War , Soviet-American relations have assumed the form of a pyramid , with multifarious day-to-day economic , political , and quasi-military dealings throughout the world forming its base and the nuclear strategic standoff forming its apex . In between rise the escalatory steps , ranging from economic sanctions , the use of proxy forces , and the like on up to the threat of nuclear devastation . In maintaining this structure , the two powers have labored under a dual compulsion : to oppose one another all around the globe , because of their sharply antagonistic political philosophies , and to cooperate and agree , because of their common interest in avoiding nuclear annihilation . The opposition has fuelled several wars  --  in Korea , in Vietnam , in the Middle East  --  and the cooperation has led to repeated summit conferences and , more recently , to the SALT agreements and to the other political and economic agreements that made up the substance of what came to be called dkente . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that President Carter and President Brezhnev exchanged at the signing of the SALT II agreement in Vienna seven months ago . In responding to the double pull of the relationship , the two powers arrived in the last fifteen years or so at a modus vivendi in which they confined their belligerent activities to the lower steps of the escalatory pyramid  --  to " peripheral " third countries where revolutions and intrigues of all kinds could be encouraged or crushed  --  and concentrated their cooperative energies on maintaining stability at the apex , from which both countries looked down into the nuclear abyss . It was only one of the many unfortunate oddities of the Soviet-American arrangement that in domestic political terms measures that our government took at the base of the pyramid , where American lives and immediate interests were at stake , were more costly than moves it made at the apex , in the crucial but rarefied and , to most people , incomprehensible realm of nuclear strategy . The paradox was that it apparently required a higher degree of political courage to counter the Soviets with conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apocalypse . If strategic common sense suggested recourse to conventional measures first and to nuclear threats only later , domestic politics often suggested the reverse . Secretary of State Dulles was only one in a long series of American politicians to seek out a policy of politically cost-free international toughness when he devised the strategy of massive retaliation , which aimed at replacing the highly unpopular use of ground forces around the world with increased nuclear power and supposedly increased " will , " or willingness , to use nuclear weapons in a crisis . Today , the Soviet Union is on the move in South Asia , and again this country has had to decide how to respond . The President , in a departure from the modus vivendi of recent times , has chosen to disrupt Soviet-American relations at their nuclear apex , by postponing the congressional debate on the ratification of SALT IT , as well as at the base , by embargoing shipments of grain and some high-technologicaI products to the Soviet Union , and by conditionally recommending a boycott of the 1980 summer Olympics , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each of the President 's minor and transient disruptions of business as usual ran into heavy opposition from interested parties , whereas the possibly fateful postponement of SALT it , which sent a tremor through the whole structure of world peace , was almost universally , and quite casually , accepted . In Iowa , where the Presidential campaign was getting under way in earnest , seven out of nine candidates in the running ( not counting the Preside n t ) ? six Republicans and one Democrat  --  opposed the embargo on wheat , on the ground that the cost to farmers , a number of whom were soon to cast ballots in a straw vote for the Presidential nomination , was too high . None of the candidates opposed the postponement of SAT.T 11 ; the same six Republicans who opposed the embargo favored defeat of the treaty in the Senate . Even before the invasion of Afghanistan , all the candidates who now opposed the embargo had repeatedly called on the President to display greater resolve in dealing with the Soviet Union . But a call for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolve in his own actions , usually by showing a readiness to make some kind of sacrifice . A call for someone else to make a sacrifice is empty . As it happened , by a fluke of timing , the embargo handed the nine political candidates a perfect opportunity to display their resolve : something that the candidates uniquely wanted  --  nomination for the Presidency  --  was potentially at stake in their decision , owing to the embargo 's presumed unpopularity with the Iowa farmers . In the event , the only resolve that most of them displayed was the resolve to win the Iowa straw vote . Hopes for a cost-free policy of global toughness were still alive , it seemed , as our politicians , who so casually set aside a negotiation aimed at safeguarding our supreme common interest , stood fast to protect a local economic interest and their own political futures . ? ? Pills EL , - ) rtAtto SOLON , a physicist , a Ph.D . in radiological health , and the director of the Bureau for Radiation Control of the city 's Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day for some glass vials of potassium-iodide pills . Unable to find them , he described the pills instead ? " white , round , a little like an aspirin . " Dr. Solon has recommended that the city stockpile thirty million vials , each containing fourteen of the pills , for immediate distribution to New Yorkers in the event of a serious accident at Indian Point , the nuclear power complex in Westchester County . Last week 's earthquake in IVestchester , within five miles of Indian Point , which is situated just three thousand feet from a major branch of the Ramapo Fault system , made recommendations for dealing with such an accident especially pertinent . But why potassium iodide ? " As a scientist , I address the public-health question , " he said . " To put it theoretically , I would n't have distributed potassium iodide at Three Mile Island if I 'd known that what hap pened was all that was going to happen , but you ca n't know that in advance . If there should be any such accident at Indian Point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if the meteorological conditions at the moment might seem to make it unnecessar ? . " Dr. Solon 's concern is volatile iodine-131 and iodine-133 , which are among the earliest radionuclides released into the air after a nuclear accident and are among the most serious , because they concentrate in the thyroid and represent a potential threat of thyroid cancer , among other illnesses . Chemically , the thyroid gland does not distinguish between radioactive iodine and stable iodine , so if a stable iodine such as that in potassium iodide is administered , it will block or dilute the radioactive iodine and lessen its effect . Taken within one hour after exposure , potassium iodide will prevent more than ninety per cent of the radiation danger to the thyroid . Taken from three to four hours after exposure , it will still reduce the risk by fifty per cent . The Three Mile Island affair was , in Dr. Solon 's words , " a marvellous prophylactic , " and soon after it occurred his bureau began to draft a proposal for stockpiling , which is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doses  --  of a hundred and thirty milligrams for adults and a minimum of sixty-five milligrams for children under one year  --  be stockpiled so that each person in the city could JANUARY 2 8 19 8 take a dose every day for anywhere from ten to fourteen days . On an average working day , there are eight million people in the city . Ten million of the ten-to-fourteen-day series of doses would he kept on hand in Health Department District Health Centers and in nearly one thousand pharmacies . The health centers would distribute the doses free , and the pharmacies would agree to sell the series to the public for about a dollar . Other places where the doses would he kept on hand would be firehouses , police stations , hospitals , factories , and office buildings . Post-emergency distribution would involve twenty million additional series of doses . The pills , manufactured by Wallace Laboratories , cost forty-one cents per series . The total price tag for such preparedness would be thirteen million dollars , to cover public education , the training of workers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units . Opposed to this is a horrific cost if the city 's people are exposed without such protection . Dr. Solon 's proposal notes , " If the eight million residents of New York City were exposed to an average of ten rem per person during a nuclear accident , 172 cases of thyroid cancer and a total of 496 persons with thyroid nodules could result in the first five years . If the average person lived forty years after the accident , the accident would be responsible for 3,968 persons with nodules distributed as follows : 1,243 cases of thyroid cancer and a total of 2,725 persons with benign nodules . ... Thus , the minimum cost of care of the thyroid glands of New York City residents after a serious nuclear accident would in-elude $19.2 billion for outpatient prevention and follow-up , $128 million for removal of 13,760 cancerous nodules , and $163 million for removal of 25,920 benign nodules . " This , of course , is only the cost in dollars . The special group established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to investigate the Three Mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any city within thirty miles of a reactor , and we asked Dr. Solon whether that recommendation would affect his proposal . " Evacuate New York ? " he said . " You ca n't even evacuate New York on Labor Day . As a boy from the South Bronx , I know . The N.R.C. 's radius of concern used to be five miles . Then it became ten , then thirty . Realistically , in the event of a major release from a **28;6281;TOOLONG reactor , which is the current output of the reactors we 're building , I think we 're talking about the potential of volatile-iodine dispersions of up to one hundred miles from the plant . Where you make the decision to evacuate is arbitrary . At some point , you say that the danger is sufficiently reduced , but there is n't anything magical about thirty miles . It 's not pi , or e or c , the speed of light . Furthermore , there are other emissions to worry about . Strontium-90 , cesium-137 , krypton-85 , and a large number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident  --  that is , a meltdown  --  but you ca n't do very much about them . You can do something about iodine-131 and iodine-133 , and they also happen to he of dominant concern because their half-lives are only eight days and one day , respectively ; they are abundant in spent reactor fuel ; and they tend to attack a single body organ . Protection against them would accomplish a great deal . " We asked Dr. Solon about the probability of a serious accident . " It 's a little like car insurance and automobile accidents , " he answered . " The probability of an accident for any one car is small , but if everybody drives , in the course of a year there will be a certain number of accidents  --  hence the need for insurance . If nuclear power plays a dominant role in energy generation in the United States for the next three decades  --  which appears likely  --  there will he an accident . I would say you would have to view the occurrence of a bad accident in some plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The decision on our potassium-iodide proposal is a political and economic decision , in the last analysis . Within the over-all matrix , the fiduciary matrix is something even a physicist can understand . The decision is up to the people who have the money or can appropriate it . There is also a judgment implied by the proposal . By passing it , will the city be creating a certain amount of concern or apprehension which is going to be unpopular with the utilities that are representing nuclear energy as the wave of the future and a safe kind of energy option ? The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is supposed to be looking after public health , and to a substantial de- ? gree it does . But built into the structure of the federal bureaucracy is a certain feeling of promoting nuclear energy and not implying a lack of safety . I think it unlikely that suitable solar or fusion sources will be developed in the near future , and , knowing the American temperament , I doubt if we 'll ever see the kind of conservation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we have to live with it , we should make it as safe as possible . " In the proposal , notice was assiduously taken of the multibillion-dollar costs in energy , job losses , and the work of decommissioning and decontamination if Indian Point were to be shut down or relocated . We asked I ) r . Solon for his personal views on Indian Point . " Indian Point should never have been built so close to the city , " he said . " It should n't be there . I say close the damn thing down , but do it thoughtfully . " Boat Show THE seventieth annual New York National Boat Show occupied all four floors of the Coliseum last week . More than five hundred boats were on display , together with a lot of marine ? equipment and supplies  --  boat polish , motor brackets , lube pumps , and so forth  --  and , on the day we stopped by , there were between three and four thousand visitors wandering around the boats , climbing into them , standing in them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting in long lines for the privilege of boarding them . There were also several hundred sales representatives wandering around . The visitors could be distinguished from the sales representatives in at least two ways : most of the sales representatives wore name tags , while most of the visitors did not ; and most of the sales representatives wore light clothing , while most of the visitors wore quilted jackets or other winter outerwear . The mingling of the visitors ' and sales representatives ' conversations produced an incessant hum , not unlike the sound in a stadium just before a game is to begin . People said : " O.K. So you want a fifty or a six- " T do n't want more than four people on my boat . " " Ninety-four thousand five . That 's including freight and everything else . If you hold off , the price will go up . " " All we do is put a piece of mahogany across here , and she mounts right there . " " Where are the sailboats ? " " Susie , take Aaron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right here . Be hack in two minutes . " " The fuel economy will be worse , but only by a gallon or a gallon and a half . " " Give me a call at the yard . give you the yard number . My name is Roy , and I 'll show you the boats . " " I do n't want to lose Jay . " " The block is basically the same . The intake manifold is different . It 'll be easier to start . " " Where 's Arnie ? " " These two are wet items . The cleaner and brightener are wet items . " " Where is Jay ? " " They have inflatable catamarans . " " They sold two boats this morning . " " It 's a modified V. The beam is seven feet eleven inches . The maximum capacity is fifteen hundred and ninety pounds .

No , man , it 's not a boat , it 's just an engine , that 's all , and pulls you around . That 's what I 'm trying to tell you . " " They 're giving away a Howmar Phantom over there . " " They 're giving away some fire extinguishers upstairs . " " You 've got to fill out a card . " " V engamos . No . Aqui . " " Two cylinders . It 's rated at five thousand r.p.m .

The party was held on the exact birthday of the founder , Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney ( 1875-1942 ) , and among the grand total of twenty-five hundred and eighty-three guests were well over four hundred artists whose works are in the Permanent Collection of the Whitney . Nine hundred and forty-four Whitney artists , ranging in age from thirty to a hundred , had been invited to the event , " He has some final words he wants to say , Nurse . Send in his speechwriters. " and that such a high percentage of them actually turned up is a tribute both to the welcome longevity of artists  --  a number of guests had exhibited at the first Whitney show , in November , 1931 ? and to the affection in which artists have always held the Whitney . It was established by Mrs. Whitney in several converted private houses down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention was to foster the art of living American artists . A sculptor of considerable professional renown , Mrs. Whitney was not so isolated by wealth as to forget that artists could be needy as well as gifted , and it was said of her that she often bought  --  both for her own collection and for the museum  --  not the best work of an artist , which he might hope to be able to sell elsewhere , but the second-best , which nobody else would have . The Whitney family has always maintained close ties with the museum . In a charming memento presented to guests at the party , Mrs. Whitney 's daughter Flora Whitney Miller , who was president of the museum from 1942 until 1966 and is its present honorary chairman , gave a delightful glimpse of family matters : Fifty years ago , at the opening of the Whitney Museum on West 8th Street , my mother hail a small party , mostly of artists , and she made a little speech , which was rare for her to do . It truly was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lovely place . In all the years since , we have tried to maintain the special atmosphere that would make artists feel at home .... My mother left the Museum to me when she died . She said I could sell it or keep it . Imagine if I had sold the greatest museum of American art in the world ! My contribution during all the years I was president was to move the Museum to this inspired building that Marcel Breuer and Hamilton Smith designed , and that was constructed by them with the help of Michael Irving , my architect son-in-law , who had much to do with the planning . Now my daughter , Flora Irving , as the president , is doing a truly marvelous job , and no one would have been more proud of her , as we celebrate our 50th Anniversary , than her grandmother , Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney . The party at the Whitney was paid for by Devoe &; Raynolds ( a division of a conglomerate entitled , almost too swingingly , Grow Group , Inc. ) , which is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the business of selling paints to artists . By an irony , Devoe &; Raynolds has given up this aspect of its business , but it 's plain that somebody connected with it knows how artists Feel about drinking and dancing , because impromptu bars had been set up here and there all over the Whitney , and the dance floor never failed to be crowded with lively octogenarian practitioners of the arts . Everywhere one looked were beaming artists and beaming collectors , to say nothing of beaming Whitneys ; in a single sashay across the fourth floor , we encountered Isamu Noguchi , Raphael Soyer , Louise Nevelson , Romare Bearden , Saul Steinberg , Arthur Altschul , Lee Krasner , Constance Mellon , Alex Katz , Mr. and Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney , Philip Pearlstein , Sandra Payson , Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Vogel , Christo , Duane Hanson , Mr. and Mrs. David Prager , Red Grooms , and Mr. and Mrs. McCauley Conner . Making our way against the incoming tide on the great , dungeonlike stone stairs of the museum , we bumped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Haas , Hilton Kramer , Mrs. John Sloan , Avis Berman , Mr. and Mrs. Al Hirschfeld , Charles Addams , Leo Castel , Ann flvlliott , Carter Wiseman , Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd Goodrich , Edwin Grosvenor , Mayor Koch , and Isabel Bishop . On lower floors , higher mirth ; among those standing about aghast with admiration when , on the second floor , the candles on the birthday cake were being lit by flora Irving and Tom Armstrong , director of the museum , were Lily Auchincloss , Father Pike , Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Dillon , Charlotte Curtis , Roy Lichtenstein , Richard Anuszkiewicz , George Segal , and Alice Neel . How long did the party last ? Till long past midnight . Was everybody happy ? Yes . What were most of the guests looking forward to as they made their way out onto Madison Avenue ? More Whitney parties .
