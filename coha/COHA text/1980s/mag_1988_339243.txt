" You 're going to lose your hearing if you keep listening to all that loud music , " parents railed right from the beginning . " No way ! " offspring scoffed , and gleefully cranked up Hot Tuna another punishing notch . Today that parental admonition is being echoed by a new  --  and more credible  --  source : rock musicians . John Flansburgh of the cult band They Might Be Giants half jokingly says : " Deafness is one of the little sacrifices you have to make for rock . " <P> Three decades after the rock revolution , more and more performers are discovering that their hearing is permanently damaged . " It 's pretty apparent for everyone who has been in the business , " notes Charles Blanket , a New York City sound engineer . Commander Cody , a rock musician in the San Francisco Bay area , suffers from tinnitus , a ringing in the ears . So does Lenny Kaye , a journeyman guitarist who played with the Patti Smith Group . Singer and Bassist Kathy Peck , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Deaf Club , where deaf patrons danced to the music 's vibrations , has lost 40% of the hearing in her right ear and wears a hearing aid . <P> Peck , for one , has found the price of devotion to rock unnecessarily steep . She and Dr. Flash Gordon of the Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic recently founded an outfit named HEAR ( for Hearing Education Awareness for Rockers ) to alert performers , technicians and concert-hall staffers to the perils of pounding music and the precautions that can be taken . First among them : regular hearing checkups . They hope the message will filter down to young fans . <P> The damage is insidious . Noise above 100 decibels  --  a whining power saw , for example  --  flattens the tiny hairs in the inner ear that transmit sound to the nerves . These hairs usually return to normal , but repeated assaults by high-decibel rock  --  concerts routinely hover around 120  --  can cause them to lose their resilience permanently . Stereo earphones blasting away for hours may be a greater threat than concerts . Says Audiologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City : " It 's like the nozzle of a fire hose has been stuck down the ear canal . " <P> The strain on rockers ' ears is slowly easing . Musicians no longer perform before walls of loudspeakers . Today giant speakers are relegated to the sides of the stage or suspended from the proscenium . " Half the concerts are quieter on the stage than anywhere else in the house , " notes Flansburgh . Many rockers now sport protective gear during practice sessions and even during performances . Saxophonist Benjamin Bossi of the Ordinaires , a New York City- based band , dons headphones before concerts . Fred Schneider , vocalist for the B-52 's , stuffs tissue into his ears . Rock Promoter Bill Graham , who is shepherding the current Amnesty International tour , keeps vats of earplugs available for everyone from security guards to roadies . <P> Fans , too , are being urged to plug up . Perhaps the best role model is Alexa Ray , the 2 1/2-year-old daughter of Billy Joel and Christie Brinkley , who flaunts ear protectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , is simply to turn the volume down . Heresy ? Perhaps . Better hearing ? For sure .
