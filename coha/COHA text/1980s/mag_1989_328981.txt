Whether as a pro quarterback or a political pro , Jack Kemp has always been nimble and quick . Those qualities came in handy last week , as he dealt with the scandal at the Department of Housing and Urban Development , which has billowed from a candlestick into an inferno . Before celebrating his 54th birthday with 54 cakes from admiring employees , the beleaguered HUD chief wryly conceded , " When I first took the nomination from President Bush , I wanted to make HUD a high-profile agency . I do n't think this is what I had in mind . " <P> In his trial by fire , the personal stakes are high for the feisty former nine-term New York Congressman who vainly sought the Republican presidential nomination last year . The self-styled " progressive conservative " has long turned the neat trick of attracting right-wing support with his antitax , free- enterprise economic policies while urging his party to reach out to blacks by conceiving compassionate programs . He had hoped to turn HUD into a shining example of how his party could put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spurring new development in the inner cities and providing housing for the homeless . But Kemp has found that before he can house anyone , he must first clean house at HUD . <P> Last week , as in all recent weeks , housecleaning swamped the rest of his agenda . The Secretary did win a brief respite from his headaches by traveling to Detroit , where he achieved a rare feat for a Republican leader : he received three standing ovations from the N.A.A.C.P. 's annual convention . Kemp admitted candidly that the G.O.P. was " nowhere to be found " in the great civil rights struggles of the 1960s and vowed that his party will change . He called on South Africa to " let our people go . " But such pleasantries inevitably faded as he addressed the mess at HUD , earnestly vowing that he would " work for the people in need , not those motivated by greed " and would not allow HUD 's troubles to become " an excuse to close down programs for poor folks . " <P> Kemp spent much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Capitol Hill , fielding tough questions from two House subcommittees probing the scandal . For the first time , he put a price tag on the loss to taxpayers from the fraud and mismanagement under former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce : $2 billion . At least half of that appears to have been siphoned from a six-year- old program in which the Federal Housing Administration , an arm of HUD , shares the insurance of housing projects with private companies . <P> Kemp tried to avoid direct criticism of his predecessor , whom he called a decent and honorable man , but nonetheless noted that HUD is still dealing with more than 1,900 recommendations from the department 's inspector general for tightening lax procedures , suggestions that had sat on Pierce 's desk without action . <P> Pierce 's fraying reputation suffered a more serious blow last week , when one of his former top aides implicated him directly in the scandal . Though Pierce had told a House subcommittee last May that he had never been personally involved in HUD program grants , Shirley McVay Wiseman told the panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million in federal subsidies for a housing project in Durham , N.C. , proposed by Pierce 's former law partner . She refused , she said , so Pierce signed the papers .
