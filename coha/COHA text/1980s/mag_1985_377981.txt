Last week Cuban President Fidel Castro confirmed a news report that his country was Vesco 's latest host . But Castro ridiculed speculation that the fugitive American financier was being held against his will . Castro told a news conference in Havana that Vesco arrived in Cuba three years ago seeking medical treatment for an unknown ailment .
