But he was 27 and a graduate student at the University of Colorado before he got his IBM PC . " It had become painfully obvious that I could no longer match my peers simply by being bright , " he recalls . " The computer opened all sorts of doors for me . " Now Young is earning a Ph.D . in biology , working as a laboratory consultant and writing more than he ever did when he had the use of his arms and legs . " The best part , " he says , " is that I can do it all with no outside help .
