Ah , spring break . The traditional time to shed campus cares and haul hormones off for some sun and fun . But as the recess started last week at Vanderbilt University , one group of students was off in pursuit of more serious exertions . A score went to a Sioux reservation in South Dakota to do painting , tiling and light carpentry at a Y.M.C.A. center ; a dozen arrived in Juarez , Mexico , to help build a " serviglesia , " a church to serve the poor ; another twelve headed for Appalachia 's " Valley of Despair " to plant fir trees and work on construction and furniture-building projects . Says Vanderbilt Senior Ethel Johnson , 21 , who stayed in Nashville with another team sowing gardens , making curtains and teaching English in a community of Cambodian refugees : " Students are vastly underestimated . They have a real desire to get out there and do something to try to help and to have their eyes opened . " <P> Vanderbilt 's Alternative Spring Break is simply one rustling of a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 Stanford volunteers took time out two weekends ago to paint an elementary school gym in East Menlo Park . In Boston , Wellesley undergrads tend to homeless women every night at Rosie 's Place , a local shelter . At Northwestern in Evanston , Ill. , volunteers have started an " adopt a grandparent " program to aid the elderly . Students at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor help low-income people with tax returns . <P> No one can say exactly how many are involved overall ; the best estimate is that 15% to 25% of collegians engage regularly in some form of public service . Many campus volunteer agencies are finding that interest is higher than it has been since the early ' 70s . Declares Stanford University President Donald Kennedy : " Everybody 's view of this generation was that they were careerist , that they were yuppies inthe making . I always thought that was a bum rap . " <P> Today 's volunteers , however , are no throwback to the ' 60s activists . " It 's not enough to say peace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who worked in a storefront school in Harlem and is now a big brother to a youngster in Providence . " We need to be realistic about our expectations so we do n't burn out . " Linda Chisholm , co-director of the Partnership for Service Learning , an organization that has sent students to assist schools in Jamaica and Ecuador , explains , " They have n't decided who is right and who is wrong . And they are n't saying that others should change . They 're saying , ' I 'll change . I 'll do it . ' " The Peace Corps is enjoying an increase in applicants who are college graduates , and Spokeswoman Alixe Glen characterizes most of them as " realistic idealists . "
