For the past month , after classes at Princeton , Brooke Shields has been slipping into New York City to rehearse , and last week she made her off- Broadway debut in Marguerite Duras ' 1977 play The Eden Cinema . The setting is French Indochina during the 1930s , and Shields , 20 , portrays Suzanne , a fetching 16-year-old who is courted by a rich plantation owner . Director Francoise Kourilsky approached her for the part last year . Shields , who is majoring in French literature and had studied Duras ' work at school , readily accepted her first professional nonmovie role . " She is a very strong actress , " says Kourilsky of her star , " and takes direction very well . " The reviewers ' grades are due this week .
