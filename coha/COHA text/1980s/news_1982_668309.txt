WASHINGTON - Like his three predecessors in the White House , President Ronald Reagan has entered a phase where he is increasingly screened from the public and the press . In Reagan ' s case , the ostensible reason is the report that an assassination squad sponsored by Libya has targeted the President and other key Administration officials . Since news of the threat was leaked by White House sources in earlyDecember , Reagan has cut back his outside activity . He even canceled plans to venture a few yards beyond the White House grounds to light the national Christmas tree at an annual ceremony , and has appeared at few public gatherings since that time . FBI Director William Webster said a week ago that the FBI had never been able to confirm that any of the " hit men " had entered the country , and when asked if the hit-squad reports could have been planted to make the government look somewhat silly , Webster said : " That ' s always a possibility . " Yet the extraordinary security measures persist . There are sharpshooters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checkpoints for spectators at events attended by Reagan , phantom presidential limousines in the streets and decoy presidential helicopters in the sky . All the while , Reagan is secluded within the majestic trappings of his office . Even as there is skepticism in Washington circles over the existence of the Libyan hit squad - " That one ' s not playing too well , is it ? " said one White House aide - there is also growing suspicion that the threat is being used as an excuse to protect Reagan ' s privacy . It has become a modern tradition for American Presidents to sequester themselves . Both Richard M. Nixon in 1972 and Gerald R. Ford in 1976 chose the " Rose Garden strategy " - they stayed at home , claiming business pressures , rather than submit to the unpredictable furies of campaigning against Democratic challengers . For six months in late 1979 and 1980 , Jimmy Carter cited the Iranian hostage crisis as an obstacle to his desire to travel about the country . In each case , the inactivity was also deemed to be convenient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resorting to silence . Last Wednesday , the White House press office refused to let television cameras or reporters near Reagan during visits by several officials , despite the daily practice of providing " photo opportunities " on such occasions . The " photo opportunity " is a device to get favorable exposure for a President and his visitors on TV without facing hostile questions from reporters . But because Reagan is rarely accessible to the press , reporters have begun asking questions at what they call " photo ops . " After none was scheduled Wednesday , an argument developed between television correspondents and deputy press secretary Larry Speakes , who was said to have told them , " Look , there are some days when we ' re just not going to let you have a shot at him . " Asked about the incident later , Speakes said the networks were being punished for " bad manners " displayed the day before when West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt visited Reagan in the Oval Office . At that time , reporters - notably Sam Donaldson , the irrespressible ABC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last August by Reagan aide Michael Deaver . According to the " Deaver rule , " no questions are permitted in the presence of other heads of state . White House communications chief David Gergen said the rule was imposed to insure " dignity " during state visits . Gergen also contended last week that press access to the President is still relatively open . He said Reagan had given 10 interviews to various members of the press during the past month . But Reagan has held only five formal press conferences in his first year in office , the lowest total in memory for an occupant of the White House . The security blanket thrown up against the " hit squad , " the " Deaver rule " and other efforts by the White House staff to shield Reagan from public appearances are reminiscent of the 1980 campaign when Reagan ' s political aide , Lyn Nofziger , physically blocked reporters from asking Reagan questions after the candidate had damaged himself with impromptu answers . Reagan joked about the situation last Thursday when the press was permitted into the Oval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiator Paul Nitze . " I couldn ' t give you a photo opportunity yesterday , " Reagan said . " I ' d just washed my hair and couldn ' t do a thing with it . " But he was not responsive to a few questions tossed at him , and he has scheduled only one short out-of-town appearance this month . Although political opponents of Nixon , Ford and Carter were quick to criticize their decision to avoid the public , there has been a reluctance to complain about Reagan ' s posture so far - in part because the President and his press secretary , James Brady , were wounded in an assassination attempt last March , and , in part , because of the imponderable nature of the latest threat . But one former Carter aide said privately that it appeared that the Libyan " hit squad " was being exploited by the Reagan White House . " If you had seen some of the stuff that came across our desk it would make your hair curl , " the former Carter aide said of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration . There have also been questions raised over an unprecedented Secret Service detail assigned to presidential advisers Deaver , Edwin M. Meese 3d and James A. Baker 3d more than a month ago in connection with the " hit squad " alert . A White House spokesman acknowledged that Deaver , Meese and Baker got the protection within hours of the elevation of John R. Simpson to the post of director of the Secret Service . Simpson had been in charge of a protective detail for Reagan 10 years ago when he went on a special mission to Asia on behalf of Nixon . Jim Boyle , a spokesman for the Secret Service , said there was no connection between Simpson ' s appointment and the new security arrangement for the White House aides . He said preparations to extend protection to the three advisers had begun before Simpson got the job and described the timing as coincidental . White House spokesman Speakes said there were no plans to change the security system . " We were forced to take steps , " he said , " and until we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no change in our position .
