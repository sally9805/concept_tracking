The alliance scores a first <P> It had been a little-noticed constituency in a fading area of South London , but last week the voters put Croydon ( NorthWest ) on Britain 's political map . For the first time , a candidate backed by the alliance between the Liberal Party and the new Social Democratic Party ( S.D.P. ) took on Labor and the Tories . When the count was in , the alliance candidate had won a stunning victory , taking 40% of the vote , vs. 30.5% for the Conservatives and 26% for Labor . " We have split the old party system wide open and shown there is a real alternative , " insisted William Pitt , the victorious Liberal candidate . Pitt ( no kin to the 18th century Prime Minister ) had lost in the constituency three times before . With his triumph , declared S.D.P. Leader Shirley Williams , " we have broken the credibility barrier . " <P> Even before the campaign began in late summer , far more was clearly at stake than one parliamentary seat . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the election was a mini-referendum on Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 's hardline , rightist economic policies . Given the government 's low standing in the polls , moreover , it was an election that Labor , bedeviled with internal problems of its own , could not afford to lose if the party were to retain its standing in opposition . For the recently created alliance , the race was the big chance . Victory for Pitt offered the untested Liberal-S.D.P. coalition the prize of becoming a genuine new force in the center of Britain 's polarized politics . <P> Croydon was a good battleground . The electorate covered a wide spectrum : working-class flats , a few affluent neighborhoods , and street on street of red brick houses occupied by skilled workers and low-level managers . For weeks , the big names of all three parties , including former Tory Prime Minister Edward Heath and Labor Leaders Michael Foot and Denis Healey , campaigned hard for their candidates . Although Pitt had earlier refused to stand down in favor of Shirley Williams , he was supported by the S.D.P. 's top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as by Liberal Leader David Steel . <P> Bolstered by its first victory , the alliance campaign caravan is moving on to the Liverpool suburb of Crosby , where Shirley Williams will stand in the next by-election later this winter . If Williams can win in another traditionally Tory constituency , the S.D.P. bandwagon may really begin to roll . -
