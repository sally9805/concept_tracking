It may be called a national election , but a presidential contest is really a set of 50 simultaneous state elections . And the grand prize goes to the candidate who can put together victories in the right combination of states to win the magic 270 electoral votes . In recent years , that has been easy for Republicans , given their virtual lock on the electoral votes of the South and West . But this year Michael Dukakis and George Bush start from a near standoff in the number of electoral votes represented by states solidly for them or leaning their way . So the election seems likely to be won ( or lost ) in a handful of battleground states , especially the Big Three of Texas , Illinois and California . Together they cast 100 electoral votes , or 37% of the total needed for victory . It is difficult to see how either candidate can gain the White House without winning at least two . And in all three , the race opens as a toss-up . <P> Texas <P> University of Houston Political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election in the Lone Star State . Says he : " The key is , Can the Democrats survive the social-issues pounding and make the economy issue stick ? " That is probably the No. 1 question all over the country , but it is especially pointed in Texas . The state is highly receptive to Bush 's conservative appeals on such issues as abortion , gun control , prison furloughs and the Pledge of Allegiance ; in Texas rifle racks can rank with the flag as badges of honor . " If we allow that to be the agenda , we will get beat , " concedes Democratic Strategist Greg Hartman . <P> But Texas , though beginning to recover from a severe oil , real estate and banking slump , is still depressed enough in some areas to deny Bush half of the peace-and-prosperity theme he is pushing elsewhere and to open at least some ears to Dukakis ' time-for-a-change argument . While the unemployment rate has dropped to 6.8% , it is well above the national average of 5.6% . Texas continues to reel from bank closings  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and loan associations . Says Luan Tatum , Democratic chair in Angelina County : " I watch the TV and hear them talking about how good things are for folks , but it 's not here . " <P> In one way , Texas is a microcosm of the whole election . The Bush and Dukakis camps readily agree that the decision of those Democrats who voted for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 will be crucial nationally . Texas has as many of these so-called Reagan Democrats as any other state , and like the electorate at large , they seem to be torn . For Tommy Rushing , pausing after changing a tire in his Lufkin garage , the economic issue is paramount . Says he : " I 'm going to have to go with Dukakis . The Republicans do n't have anything to show . " About 150 miles to the west in the farm town of Hillsboro , Haberdasher James Scott is equally determined in his decision to stick with the G.O.P.
