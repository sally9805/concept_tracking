Finally the wraps are off . The " 21 " Club , New York City 's legendary oasis for high-rolling power brokers and celebrity watchers , opened its famed iron gates after a four-month face-lift , a reported $8 million exercise in cosmetic surgery that included the premises , the food and the menu as well . The big question : Has " 21 " changed ? Has the new owner-management team dared to alter the setting or , even worse , change the food ? Do they still make the famous hamburger ? And , in effect , will we still be able to love it and hate it ? <P> Not that anyone with eyes or a palate could possibly have thought the old place was really in good shape , or that the pricey food was anything more than dependably dreary . But nostalgia is a heady seasoning , and panic set in among habitues as soon as the word was out that the new owner , Marshall S. Cogan 's Knoll International Holdings Inc. , had turned the management over to Ken Aretsky and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Side boutique-restaurant celebrated for its new American cooking . Even more frightening to those accustomed to " 21 's " innocuous but soothing nursery dishes was the news that Rosenzweig , who would mastermind the kitchen , had chosen as her lieutenant Alain Sailhac , one of the best French chefs in the country , who had distinguished himself at Le Cirque . What was right for Arcadia and fancy French restaurants would not be right for " 21 , " doubters said , fearing nothing so much as an invasion of foodies and yuppies . Yet faced with an aging clientele , the new team clearly had to attract a younger , more style-conscious audience . New or old , all " 21 " customers had better bring money : the prices are now even more astronomical than they used to be . ( For real plungers , there is a new members-only breakfast club , with a $1,500 initiation fee and $250 annual dues . Then you pay for the meal . ) <P> The vote is still out on how well Rosenzweig and Aretsky are doing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of which is new or redesigned . After one lunch in the bar and two dinners in the second-floor dining room , this critic can report that the answers to the burning questions about changes , so far , are yes and no . The public and banquet rooms at " 21 " are nearly the same , but they are brighter and fresher . An eccentric addition to the lobby is a life-size wooden horse , a 19th century conceit that is the pet purchase of Cogan . The more sweeping changes were made in the brand new kitchens , and despite some lapses , the food has generally improved . <P> The most critical room is the bar , drinking and eating headquarters for the most die-hard devotees . Blessedly , it is intact , with all appointments , including the famous collection of toys , cleaned and polished . This remains the noisy , sexy , energizingly macho soul of " 21 . " Clients who favored the upstairs room will probably continue to do so ; more than ever it suggests a European dining salon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do not .
