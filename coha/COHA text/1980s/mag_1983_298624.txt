Not since Viet Nam has the U.S. flexed so much muscle abroad <P> For a country at peace , the U.S. is throwing its military weight around a lot these days . To be sure , no American soldiers are on the attack anywhere in the world . But the U.S. has a remarkable portion of its troops , ships and planes around the planet , including contingents from every branch of the service deployed on three continents , well within shooting distance of hot combat zones-Lebanon , Chad , Central America . This show of force represents nothing so grand or explicit as a " Reagan Doctrine . " But President Reagan is clearly not a bit timid about using U.S. military might abroad to serve what he sees as important national ends . " This President , " says White House Chief of Staff James Baker , " has shown that the U.S. can project American power abroad in a prudent and responsible way . " <P> Prudent or not , U.S. power is now projected from the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops landed in Honduras last week to begin months of deadly serious war games , and 550 Air Force personnel arrived in the Sudan with eight F-15 fighters , two KC-10A tankers and a pair of AWACS radar planes prepared to track Libya 's Soviet-made jets bombing Chad ( see WORLD ) . Whatever the arguments about its prospects in one place or another , the new expansiveness is being questioned on practical grounds : U.S. forces could be spread too thin , as the Army 's Chief of Staff suggested last week . <P> Is the U.S. striding into a new , tough-guy phase as a world power ? In the decade since the U.S. retreated from Viet Nam , Washington 's foreign policy has been subject to a sometimes healthy , sometimes paralyzing fear of involvement in far-off military engagements . As a result , says a senior State Department official , " we had come to be seen by the rest of the world as irresolute , lacking consistency and the will to apply power to preserve American interests . " Today , Reagan is clearly seeking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nam . But while newly confident and so far unchallenged , U.S. military moves overseas are still constrained by a residue of deep national wariness . " The American public will love a good bash if U.S. interests are directly involved , " says a Cabinet member from a previous Republican Administration . " But the U.S. public is not going to tolerate our being the policeman of the world . " <P> The Reagan Administration 's willingness to send men and matriel around the world is hardly surprising . It is consistent with the President 's starkly anti-Communist world view . And while his policy pronouncements sometimes seem awkward or belligerent , the President 's deployments have not been reckless . Direct confrontation with the Soviets has been avoided , and U.S. casualties ( six killed in Lebanon , one in El Salvador ) have been few .
