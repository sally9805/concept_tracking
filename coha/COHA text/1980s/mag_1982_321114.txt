A friend of the U.S. , Fahd becomes King of Saudi Arabia <P> To Arabians , he was a beloved figure , more at home sipping tea with Bedouins in the desert than discussing policy in the corridors of power . Diplomats were often surprised , one visitor recalled , when he would engage them in talk about " the stars , hunting and spring rains , topics that made his eyes brighten . " He was a reluctant monarch who ascended the throne to preserve family unity , and he eagerly delegated authority to younger and more sophisticated members of the royal family . When he died last week at the age of 69 , Khalid ibn Abdul Aziz ibn Saud , King of Saudi Arabia since 1975 , was revered as a wise ruler who provided a mantle of tradition and stability to his country through an era of unparalleled turmoil and change . <P> The King 's death came at an awkward moment . The Israeli invasion of Lebanon had once again exposed the weaknesses and divisions of the Arab world . And Iran 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat to the moderate Arab monarchies of the Persian Gulf . <P> But a swift and sure transition of power had already been arranged by the Saud family 's council of elders . Within hours , Khalid was succeeded by Crown Prince Fahd , 60 , his able and ambitious half brother , who has in effect been running the kingdom on a day-to-day basis since Khalid became King in 1975 . In a voice heavy with emotion , the new King informed his countrymen of Khalid 's death over Saudi radio . " Our love for him compels us to continue his march , pursue his hopes and complete his plans , " he said . In accordance with Islamic law and Saudi custom , Khalid 's body was wrapped in a brown shroud and buried in an unmarked grave before sunset on the day he died . <P> A more worldly and dynamic personality than Khalid , King Fahd is widely viewed as the Saudi leader most sympathetic to U.S. policies . His accession signals no major change in the kingdom 's policies . Said a U.S. State Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same basically sound cooperative relationship that we have had with Saudi Arabia for the past few years . " <P> With equal speed and in strict accordance with royal protocol , the ruling hierarchy elevated Prince Abdullah , 59 , a half brother of Fahd 's , to Crown Prince . Abdullah , who is commander of the national guard , is considered an articulate advocate of Arab nationalism and Palestinian rights ( see box ) . Prince Sultan , 58 , a full brother of Fahd 's , became second in line to the throne . He will retain his positions as Minister of Defense and Aviation and commander of the army . <P> Saudi specialists say that Fahd 's first task will be to shore up his credentials with the traditionalists at home . Despite personality differences between Khalid and Fahd , the two men had complemented each other . Khalid remained close to the nomadic tribes that roam the country 's desert wastelands , and his piety and sincerity appealed to devout practitioners of Wahhabism , the orthodox branch of Islam unique to Saudi Arabia . Fahd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his intelligence , flexibility and informed grasp of foreign affairs . But he had much weaker ties to the tribes , and his playboy reputation in his younger years offended more traditional elements in Saudi society .
