By early evening it was evident that a landslide was in the making . As Liberal Party faithful gathered to celebrate at Montreal 's Centre Pierre Charbonneau , loudspeakers boomed What a Feeling , the stirring theme song from the movie Flashdance . Liberal Party Chief Robert Bourassa , 52 , took the microphone and , speaking in French , hailed his party 's triumph as " a great victory for Canada . " Switching to English , he pledged to " give back to Quebec the prosperity we had 15 years ago . " <P> Across town , at the election-night headquarters of the Parti Quebecois , which had swept to power in 1976 vowing to withdraw the predominantly French- speaking province from the Canadian confederation , incumbent Premier Pierre- Marc Johnson , 39 , conceded the election . " The people of Quebec have spoken , " he declared . " They wanted a change , and from the appearance of things , they wanted a profound change . " The scale of the victory surprised even veteran political observers . Liberals won 98 of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote , up from 46% in the 1981 provincial elections . The Parti Quebecois saw its tally plummet to 37% , down from 49% four years ago under the wily but erratic leadership of Rene Levesque . <P> Liberal Boss Bourassa , who served as Quebec 's Premier between 1970 and 1976 , did not benefit from his party 's prosperity : he was defeated in his home district . A colorless personality , Bourassa was frequently referred to in the Canadian press as " the most unpopular man in Quebec " because of the general perception that his previous administration was incompetent . Having thus lost his own seat in the provincial legislature , the Premier-elect will have to run his victorious party from the public gallery until a Liberal agrees to give up a " safe " seat that he can win in a by-election . <P> Most observers attribute the Liberals ' triumph to a decline of separatist sentiment among Quebec 's 4.6 million voters , some 80% of whom speak French . Over the past decade , laws requiring special treatment for the French-speaking majority have caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in finance and business , to leave the province . The subsequent economic drain has worsened unemployment , now nearly 12% . At the same time , many French speakers feel confident that their language and culture are now adequately protected . The result : few wish to risk any longer the economic costs of separatist politics .
