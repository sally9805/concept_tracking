To hardly anyone ' s surprise , prices of oil company stocks are rising . As Texaco proceeds with its $10 billion purchase of Getty , speculation is growing that oil companies of almost any size are vulnerable to takeovers . The stock market is rediscovering the fact that oil shares are selling far below the value of the assets behind them . " Everyone is dusting off their studies and wondering what people are seeing out there , " says Jeffrey Berenson , managing director of mergers for Merrill Lynch . " You can sense the deal treadmill is about to begin again . " Yet Wall Street analysts , investment bankers and oil-company executives are a good deal more cautious than the steady climb in oil-share prices suggest . Most agree that a number of big oil companies are on the prowl , and that several medium-to-large companies might make attractive targets . However , they say , Getty was a special case in some respects . For one thing , the company was torn by internal squabbling and much of it was held by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Getty had both the incentive and the ability to sell control quickly . George Keller , chairman of Standard Oil of California , confirms that the company is looking at potential acquisition targets , as it usually does . " But as a practical matter , " he says , " you don ' t move into a thing like that unless there is some special opportunity , " such as existed with Getty . Such an opportunity would seem to exist at Superior , which is having internal troubles . " It ' s literally on the block , " says Bruce Lazier , an analyst with Prescott Ball &; Turben . Its vast undeveloped acreage would make it particularly attractive to Standard Oil of Ohio , which is seeking to replace its dwindling Alaska reserves and hasn ' t developed any significant U.S. production of its own . However , much of Superior ' s reserves are in Canada , and much of them are gas . Both factors make it less attractive than Getty , which boasted more than one billion barrels of U.S. crude reserves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for so long that its shares currently sell at 83% of its asset-liquidation value , as calculated by John S. Herold Inc. , the Greenwich , Conn. , research firm that specializes in appraising oil companies . Herold figures Getty is being purchased for 82% of its breakup value . Thus , it ' s questionable whether Superior could command much of a premium . Unocal may be the most attractively priced takeover candidate ; its shares were selling for 40% of its breakup value before the Texaco-Getty agreement , and still are priced at just 45% of that value . Unocal ' s U.S. crude reserves , though just nearly half that of Getty ' s , are substantial . It also has a lot of natural gas . The hitch to a takeover is that " there isn ' t any one shareholder who can deliver the company , " says one investment banker . And there isn ' t any reason to think Unocal is anxious to be sold . Last April it adopted a requirement that 75% of its stock or directors approve any merger with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil companies aren ' t likely to attempt an unfriendly takeover in any case , analysts stress . Thus , while Unocal is cheap , it might be tought to get . Another low-priced company is Sun Co . It has nearly as much North American crude as Getty , though some of that is in Canada , and its shares are selling for 56% of its Herold-calculated liquidation value . Moreover , 27% of the company is held by the Glen Mede trust for the founding Pew family . Including shares that aren ' t held by the trust , the family owns about 31% . " Beware of parallels between Sun and Getty , " a corporate spokesman warns . " The trust is happy with management at Sun , and the relationship is close . " Nonetheless , Sun ' s exploration record has been disappointing , according to William Craig , an E.F. Hutton analyst . That factor might make holders more eager to sell . " If you could make a deal with the Pew family , " Mr. Craig adds , " it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to its poor exploration record , Mr. Craig says , is Louisiana Land &; Exploration . However , as a perennial subject of takeover rumors , its shares have risen to 81% of its breakup value , which might discourage bidders from offering much of a premium . Phillips Petroleum shares are just 51% of its liquidation value . More important , according to some analysts , its shares are cheap relative to its cash flow . " If you can buy at a low multiple of cash flow that ' s a key , " says Warren Shimmerlik of Merrill Lynch , " because it ' s cash flow that ' s going to help you pay off the purchase price . " Amerada Hess is selling at just 44% of its breakup value , but Leon Hess controls about 16% of it and keeps his designs to himself . The company has struck it rich in the North Sea , but its marketing operation probably isn ' t a plus for potential bidders . Kerr-McGee sells for 63% of its breakup value , but it is widely diversified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to acquire Getty , is selling at 62% of its liquidation value . Barry Good of Morgan Stanley says that even if Texaco finances its entire purchase by borrowing , its debt-to-capitalization ratio will rise only to a still-healthy 42% from 15% . The significance of that isn ' t being lost on other oil giants . " A lot of big oil companies are thinking they should raise their debt levels " and pursue acquisitions of larger magnitude than considered previously , one investment banker says . Many speculators obviously are counting on that . Nonetheless , as Mr. Craig of E.F. Hutton warns , " if the market gets disenchanted with playing that game , the stocks can fall apart pretty quickly. "
