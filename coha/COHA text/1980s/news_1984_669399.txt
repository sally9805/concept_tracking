Two scruffy black flags are drapped on the front gate of a recently constructed fence that cordons off the lot from the bustling dirt allies of this ravaged Palestinian refugee camp. // Although it carries no name , the lot is known in Beirut as ' ' the massacre cemetery. ' ' // More than 300 men , women , and children who were gunned or axed to death during the massacre of Palestinian civilians were hastily buried in this lot . More than 400 are still missing. // As the Palestinians of Sabra and Shatila commemorate the second anniversary of the mass killings by Christian gunmen , Sept. 16-18 , the cemetery has become a focal point and a symbol. // Two years ago , the images of the tragedy evoked a world outcry , and greatly heightened interest in the Palestinian plight . But today , the survivors have begun to wonder if their hopes of returning to a homeland have faded. // In the camps of Beirut , refugees tell the few people who bother to wander through that their last hope lies with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even that does not trigger much optimism , for there is a strong feeling here that their movement will never be the same again. // After 15 months of a rebellion that badly divided the PLO into warring factions and diverted attention from the issues of a homeland and the status of hundreds of thousands of refugees , there are signs of detente. // PLO sources have announced that the long-delayed summit of the Palestine National Council - the Palestinian parliament-in-exile - will be held within a month. // The meeting of more than 400 members from throughout the Palestinian diaspora is expected to decide the status of chairman Yasser Arafat . His leadership and policies were the prime target of the mutiny , which began within his own mainstream Al-Fatah faction , then spread to other more radical branches of the eight-sided movement. // The breakthrough follows months of tortuous and often heated mediation , primarily by Algeria and South Yemen . But it represents only a partial reconciliation. // At a meeting in Aden in July , four factions agreed to a joint policy statement around which to rebuild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all American proposals , including Camp David and the Reagan plan , that do not call for full , independent statehood for the Palestinians. // * No joint political moves with Jordan that would undermine the PLO ' s claim to be the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. // // * Escalation of the armed struggle against Israel. // * Rejection of the use of arms to settle disputes within the movement. // * Termination of all political contacts with Egypt. // * Formation of a secretariat to provide collective leadership of the PLO. // The decisions represent a major defeat for Mr. Arafat . In effect , his moderate approach has been abandoned in favor of a more militant course of action that rules out the United States- and Jordanian-favored options . And his ability to manipulate the movement will now be curtailed. // Arafat ' s chief aides claim that once he is at the summit of the Palestine National Council , he will be able again to pull together sufficient support to reendorse his strategy . They point out that he controls the purse strings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority of funds , and that he is recognized by the outside world as the PLO chief. // Arafat was optimistic enough to predict that 1984 would be the ' ' year of regrouping , ' ' and 1985 the ' ' year of harvest , ' ' when the PLO would be an active force in the Middle East again. // At the same time , only four groups have joined the Fatah loyalists : The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine , the Palestine Liberation Front , and the two-year-old Palestine Communist Party . The Communists have never before come under the eight-sided PLO umbrella. // The Fatah rebels and four smaller movements have formed a ' ' national alliance ' ' to continue their protest . This group has said it will not take part in reconciliation or the Palestine National Council , and has received major support from Syria , which is crucial to any settlement . In effect , that would mean there will be two PLOs. // Arafat ' s fighting forces have also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since their evacuation from Beirut and dispersal to eight Arab countries . There are major questions about just what percentage is still loyal to him. // At least half of the estimated 16 , 000 operative fighters are now in Syrian-controlled parts of Lebanon . Most are considered to be opponents of Arafat . The other 8 , 000 are in remote camps in Algeria , Tunisia , Sudan , North and South Yemen , Iraq , Syria , and Jordan . A recent Israeli report claims the guerrillas are tightly controlled in host states , and often prevented from building , training , or operating independently. // Meanwhile , the refugees , who until the Israeli invasion in 1982 received massive aid and basic services from the PLO ' s aid programs , have found life increasingly difficult. // Thousands of men are now unemployed in Lebanon . In March , the United Nations Relief and Works Agency stopped emergency food rationing to all but 25 , 000 extreme hardship cases . The agency has also said it will need $230 million to keep its current basic programs going. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Lebanon . A recent report showed that more than 100 homes , shops , and cars had been destroyed in random bombings by unknown forces between July 1983 and May 1984 . Also , 60 were killed and 232 injured in shooting incidents. // One Palestinian who survived the Sabra and Shatila massacre reflected the feelings of many refugees in Lebanon on the eve of the second anniversary : ' ' This year there is much more to mourn than those who died here . Our hope is dying , too. ' ' // //
