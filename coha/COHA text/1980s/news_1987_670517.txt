All five recipients of permanent artificial hearts have died . Dr. William C. DeVries of Humana Hospital-Audubon in Louisville , Ky. , says he intends to implant - and the Food and Drug Administrationn has approved - at least one more permanent artificial heart . But its use as a permanent replacement is extremely controversial. // Meanwhile , the Jarvik-7 device Dr. DeVries used as well as other artificial hearts and still other models known as ventricular assist devices , or partial artificial hearts , have been temporarily implanted in at least 80 patients. // More than 50 of them survived to undergo successful human heart transplants , according to leaders in the field . About 40 of the 50 recipients are still alive and a few have gone back to work. // The artificial hearts have served as a " bridge " in patients for an average of 18 days , although the range is wide . Some were in place for only one day . Dr. D. Glenn Pennington used a Novocor ventricular assist device to support Donald Hasty for three months at St. Louis University last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cresswell a patient at Hershey Medical Center in Pennsylvania , died earlier this month after living on a Penn State heart for 397 days . Mr. Cresswell ' s immune system rejected one human heart and threatened to reject other suitable donor organs. // Many heart surgeons credited Dr. DeVries ' s swell-publicized experiments with permanent implants with inspiring greater use of the device as a temporary bridge . Dr. DeVries , though best known for his advocacy of permanent artificial hearts , has also supported the bridge concept . Last week , he said , he came close to his first such experiment in a patient whose newly transplanted heart at first failed to start beating . But the transplanted heart revived before an artificial one was needed . Other heart surgeons have said privately that Humana officials have told Dr. DeVries not to do another permanent implant , but Dr. DeVries and Humana officials denied it. // Strokes were a major complication among recipients of permanent artificial hearts and the earliest temporary mechanical devices . However , a spokesman for Symbion Inc. of Salt Lake City , which manufactures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American bridge recipients suffered a stroke , as against three of the first five . One important reason cited for the reduced risk is that most bridge recipients have lived on the device for much shorter periods than the permanent recipients did. // Instead , " infection is the Achilles ' heel " of the bridge implants , said Dr. Bartley P. Griffith of Presbyterian-University Hospital of Pittsburgh . For example , Mr. Cresswell ' s death resulted from a severe chest infection , his surgeon , Dr. William S. Pierce , said. // Most heart surgeons now feel that doing the human heart transplant as quickly as possible after the implant of the artificial heart is crucial to success. // " You don ' t gain very much by keeping the device in , and you have that added risk of infection , " although that risk is small when " reasonable care is taken , " Dr. Pierce said. // According to Symbion , 50 Jarvik hearts have been implanted as bridges , 24 in the United States and 26 elsewhere . The 13 bridge implants that Dr. Griffith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceeded only by the 19 that Dr. Christian Cabrol has done at Pitie Salpetriere Hospital in Paris. // In addition , Dr. Pierce said , 33 patients received ventricular assist devices ; 19 of these patients went on to receive human hearts , and 16 of them recovered to the point that they could leave the hospital. // Dr. Denton Cooley was the first to use an artificial heart device as a bridge to transplant , in 1969 . But the technique was not widely adopted because the success rate for heart transplants was low then ; a few recipients have survived more than 15 years , although doctors do not exactly know what set them apart from the others who died. // The renewed interest in the temporary use of artificial hearts has resulted from the astonishing successes of human heart transplants , attributable to the lessons of experience and successful use of a drug , cyclosporine. // Before the availability of cyclosporine , transplant recipients had to take large doses of other drugs that suppress the immune system or steroids to prevent rejection of the organ by the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often leading to lethal infections . Cyclosporine , by lessening the reliance on immunosuppressive drugs , decreases the risk of infection . As a result , doctors are performing more transplants , and using more artificial hearts as temporary bridges . Today , the number of heart transplants is limited only by the severe shortage of donor organs. // As artificial hearts are used more as bridges , doctors and ethicists are struggling with a number of issues. // Some heart surgeons , like Dr. J. Donald Hill of the Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center in San Francisco , believe that use of the bridge technique will allow more people to get heart transplants. // Others , like George J. Annas , a health lawyer at Boston University , have said that " as long as there is a shortage of transplantable human hearts , temporary artificial hearts can not increase the total number of human heart transplants performed ; they can only change the identity of the individuals who obtain them. " // Doctors are struggling , largely through a trial and error process , to determine for whom the available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until heart surgeons gain more experience with bridges , recipients will have poorer survival rates than will patients who receive heart transplants without the artificial heart bridge. // While one-year survival rates of 90 percent are the current goal for heart transplant patients , Dr. Griffith said he " would be thrilled " to achieve a 65 percent survival rate for bridge to transplant recipients. // According to a report from the National Institutes of Health , permanent artificial hearts might extend the lives of 35 , 000 Americans each year. // The experience gained with bridges might also speed development of a permanent artificial heart , according to Dr. Griffith . He said doctors needed to accept " a little less survival for a few patients , perhaps , after heart transplantation with the hope that what is learned will benefit far greater numbers of patients in the long term . " Such a " sacrifice " would be worthwhile , he said. // Once patients receive temporary hearts , the length of time they must wait for a human heart varies according to the availability of organs within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be equally sick. // Some experts say putting patients with temporary artificial hearts at the top of the list for transplants is a form of queue-jumping that is unfair to patients who do not receive temporary bridges . Yet experience with the Jarvik heart shows that only the rare patient has survived if the heart transplant is done more than three weeks after the bridge implant. // Dr. Griffith said he thinks of a bridge patient ' s human heart transplant ' s beginning when the patient gets the mechanical heart implant . " The first incision commits me to that individual who , at that point , becomes the sickest individual on our list , " Dr. Griffith said . " He does not become any less sick when he has the artificial heart in. " // Such a patient should be assigned the first available acceptable heart because his is " as much of an emergency as if he was being maintained on " the standard life-saving techniques that are used in intensive care units , he said. // If bridge patients are relegated to a low position on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some will become infected , and " we will develop a very negative attitude about the artificial heart , won ' t use it , and won ' t learn anything. " // Dr. DeVries said that at a recent cardiology meeting , some participants observed that hospitals within the same city or area that perform heart transplants are now developing bridge programs for competitive reasons because they feel " it is not attractive to have patients die " while waiting for a transplant. // For patients dying of heart failure , Dr. Griffith ' s team spells out the potential complications . " A small stroke would not prevent us from going ahead with transplantation , " Dr. Griffith said , because a patient with a stroke is better off with a human heart than an artificial heart . " But we clearly outline there is a chance this may be a permanent situation. " // The Federal Food and Drug Administration considers mechanical hearts as experimental and specifies that hospitals doing temporary bridges must recognize their permanent obligation to the patient should a complication occur that would preclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who receive bridges and who do not receive human heart transplants will survive long enough without complications to prove that people can live reasonably comfortably with artificial hearts. // Many pioneering cardiac surgeons are convinced that newer types of artificial hearts will be part of future medical practice . As Dr. Griffith put it , " Clearly we will not be using Jarvik-7 devices 15 years from now. " // A number of experimental permanent artificial hearts are being tested on animals such as electric motor driven devices. // Several researchers observed that the bridge trials differed from many other pioneering surgical techniques . For one , no one medical center has enough cases to fully evaluate the success or failure of bridges . Thus they are pooling their data . For another , those interviewed said they believed the reporting of such data was more complete than in other trials in which surgeons did not report their initial failures . As Dr. DeVries said of the artificial heart experiments , " the press has kept us more honest because there is more interest in it , and it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ //
