GONZALES , La.  --  The people of this small Cajun town had good reason to celebrate at their 20th annual Jambalaya Festival last month . Signs of economic recovery are sprouting in the bayou country after an extended slump . Unemployment in the past three years has jumped to double-digit rates , and real-estate values have been halved . Some people have left their families to seek work in other states ; others have given up looking for work altogether . " It ' s been a classic depression , " says Danny Sample , the president of First National Bank of Gonzales . But now the chemical factories that line the Mississippi River here just as sugar-cane plantations once did have begun taking on new workers . Two nearby plants have started major expansions , and another has a project under consideration . Although the jobless rate is still high , improvement is finally in sight . " When one plant does something , that ' s good . But now we ' ve got three talking expansion , and that ' s real good , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former barber . " I think our economy is finally beginning to turn around . " Throughout the hard-hit heartland of the U.S. economy , similar encouraging signs are rising tentatively from the destruction caused by a soaring dollar and plummeting commodity prices . As the trade deficit narrows , some manufacturers are beginning to pull out of the three-year slump . Firming prices have given farmers and oil producers reason for optimism . " The oil-rig count has turned around and started to come back up , the chemical and paper industries are doing well , and our cotton farmers and cattle ranchers are actually smiling for the first time in quite a while , " says James Smith , the director of the University of Texas Bureau of Business Research . " It ' s not a robust turnaround by any means , but things are improving . " The revival in mid-America follows a wrenching period for the U.S. economy , characterized since 1982 by wide disparities in regional growth . In the service-based states of the East Coast and California , strong consumer spending fueled robust expansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world-wide farm glut and a collapse in oil prices . So stark were the contrasts that the congressional Joint Economic Committee began referring to the bicoastal economy . But the latest signals suggest a flip-flop in the bicoastal economy . While the middle of the country slowly reawakens , growth on the coasts is being damped by higher import prices and lower consumer spending . That trend is likely to continue for several years , economists say , as the huge trade deficits built up in the first part of this decade gradually dwindle . " The Northeast and Southwest coasts are slowing down , while weaker areas are picking up , " says Jerry Jordan , senior vice president at First Interstate Bancorp . " States like Indiana and Wisconsin are now outperforming the rest of the nation . " All this doesn ' t suggest that Gonzales is about to become a boom town . Many problems facing such areas reflect long-run trends , as the economy gradually shifts further away from farming and manufacturing and more toward services . Furthermore , the current early signs of economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nipped in the bud if the economy fell into a nationwide recession . But for the moment the indicators seem to point clearly toward a gradual reinvigoration of the heartland . Industrial production , for instance , has edged up 2. 3% since September . And solid gains in factory orders suggest that the improvement will continue . " We ' ve seen steady gains among manufacturers since the first of the year " in the Midwest , says Bruce Williamson , the purchasing manager for Oil Gear Co. of Milwaukee , who conducts a survey for the Milwaukee Association of Purchasing Managers . " We ' ve seen a pickup particularly in some of the basic commodities industries like paper and plastics , and the electronics-associated industries are also doing quite well . " Not every industry is enjoying the benefits . The auto industry , in particular , is being hurt more by the slowdown in consumer spending than it is being helped by the improving trade picture . And even the manufacturers who are benefiting now are skeptical about how long the upturn will last . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident that we ' re not going to hit a recession down the road , " says Mr. Williamson . " But from all indications we ' ve gotten , the improvement will continue . " Lawrence Chimerine , the chairman of Wharton Econometrics , says : " I think it ' s case by case . But clearly , some manufacturing companies , particularly those that compete against Europe , are doing better . " Farmers are also finally turning optimistic . " You can begin to see things happening out there , " says Wayne Angell , a Federal Reserve Board governor and a former farmer from Kansas . " Commodity prices look brighter ; corn hog farm operations are wonderful this year , and the entire red-meat industry is going to have an excellent year . " Adds Phil Cummins , a senior business economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago : " There ' s still a lot of stress among farmers . But from the evidence we ' re seeing , land values are bottoming out and we ' ve had an increase in commodity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit last year , firming prices have brightened the outlook . U.S. oil prices have gone up to about $20 a barrel  --  still far below the $30 level of two years ago but well above last year ' s trough of $10 a barrel . It may still be premature to say that the oil industry is recovering . But " at least it has stopped shrinking , " Mr. Jordan of First Interstate says . Continued narrowing of the trade deficit provides the key to growth in the nation ' s midland . Government statistics show the trade deficit has been shrinking slowly since late last year , and most economists expect that to continue . The sharp drop in the dollar ' s value since early 1985 has made imports more expensive and U.S. exports more competitive overseas . In Gonzales , the improvement isn ' t a moment too soon . With a population of only 8 , 000 , it is a proud hamlet , which Mayor Berthelot and others refer to as a " two-McDonald ' s town . " The people of this small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a high dollar and a swelling trade deficit , nor do they fully understand how the dollar ' s decline now is helping them . The mayor notes wistfully that the city ' s economic problems began three years ago , about the time he was elected . A lockout at a BASF AG chemical plant left more than 300 people jobless , and the closing of another plant a few months later put 250 more people out of work . The problems in Gonzales reflected a shakeout throughout the chemical industry , caused largely by the strong dollar . Chemical manufacturers in the U.S. found exporting harder , and they faced increasing competition from imports . They came under intense pressure to cut costs . In Louisiana alone , the chemical-industry employment fell to 25 , 200 from 34 , 500 , according to Loren Scott , the chairman of the economics department at Louisiana State University . The problems along the river quickly spilled over into the rest of the town . " It hurt us a lot , " says Paul LeBlanc , a local grocer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a ripple effect . The taxi guy who usually picked up the seamen on the river didn ' t have any business , so he couldn ' t buy groceries , so I couldn ' t go buy a suit . People lost confidence , not only in the government but in themselves . " Now , though , the Shell Chemical division of Shell Oil Co. has announced a plant expansion that , starting later this summer , will employ 600 to 700 construction workers and create a few dozen permanent jobs . And in April , BASF broke ground for a new $25 million specialty amines plant that will employ 150 to 200 people in construction and 25 to 30 people full time . The company had been importing the chemical , which is used to manufacture other chemicals , from its plant in Germany . But partly because of the dollar ' s decline , the company decided to manufacture the chemical in Louisiana . At First National Bank , Mr. Sample also sees signs of improvement . " We see it in the planning process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know these jobs are coming up . It has all been within the last 45 days or so , but I ' m fairly optimistic for the area . Unless there is another unforeseen crash , I think we ' re headed up . " Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
