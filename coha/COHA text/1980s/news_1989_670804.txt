Neither the admission price , half a month ' s salary for an average Chinese , nor the current crackdown on the pro-democracy movement and " bourgeois liberalism " seemed to deter the dancers . A tall woman with long hair , dressed in a body-hugging miniskirt , gyrated as an American record pounded out the words , " Help me out , run away , I ' ll do anything you want or say. " // The scene could have been in Taiwan or Hong Kong . In the last few years Canton has become China ' s most affluent and open city , the biggest success of the liberalization policies of Zhao Ziyang , who was dismissed on Saturday as General Secretary of the Communist Party. // But while the disco is still operating after the military crackdown in Beijing and the shuffle of China ' s leadership , officials here are suddenly worried that the crackdown may hit them and undermine Canton ' s autonomous development. // " You really don ' t know what we are going to go through , " a depressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend over the weekend , in explaining why he would have to break off all contact . The official had expressed support for the student demonstrations in Beijing until the crackdown on June 4 . <> <> Political Study Sessions // In the last week , local officials have been ordered by Communist Party headquarters to begin political study sessions , a practice abandoned here since the liberalization began in 1979 . They have also heard reports that the party ' s orthodox-minded elders in Beijing have criticized Canton , and surrounding Guangdong Province , for getting too rich. // They were further worried today by the publication of an article by Jiang Zemin , the new party General Secretary , criticizing the wealth amassed by private entrepreneurs , the small businessmen encouraged by Mr. Zhao as part of his program to introduce financial incentives in place of central planning . Such entrepreneurs are an essential part of Canton ' s growth . The article appeared in the party ' s theoretical journal , Seeking Truth. // In another sign of what may be in store , the China News Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply company had been sentenced to death for accepting $45 , 000 in bribes from Hong Kong Chinese businessmen. // What happens in Guangdong , a province of 59 million people along the South China Sea , is being watched closely by diplomats , foreign business executives and people in Hong Kong as a sign of the real intentions of the Beijing Government . <> <> ' A Critical Test Case ' // " Guangdong will be a critical test case of whether the conservatives really want to continue the reforms as the official press says , or whether they are going to throw out 10 years of progress , " said an American who lives here. // Indeed , Guangdong ' s growth has been remarkable even by the standards of Taiwan , South Korea and Hong Kong . Last year its industrial output shot up 34. 6 percent , according to official Chinese statistics . The province has been such an attractive place that about 60 percent of the total foreign investment in China is now in Guangdong , roughly $4 billion . Moreover , Guangdong alone now accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provincial figures show. // Under a plan approved by Mr. Zhao , a special economic zone was created in the small town of Shenzhen on the Hong Kong border to attract foreign companies , with the right to offer tax breaks and other concessions . It has grown from a population of 20 , 000 in 1980 to 1 million today , perhaps the fastest-growing metropolis in the world , with miles of new concrete factories and apartment blocks. // There are 100 American companies doing business in Guangdong , including Pepsico , Beatrice Foods , PPG Industries , Occidental Petroleum and Arco. // So optimistic was the business climate , so convinced were even the local Communist officials that the 1 , 100 miles separating them from Beijing provided safety , that an investment company belonging to the provincial government had begun construction on a 63-story office , hotel and apartment tower , by far the tallest in China . That may now stop , officials predict . <> <> The Hong Kong Factor // Guangdong has owed its success in large part to its proximity to Hong Kong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s people came from Guangdong , they speak the Cantonese dialect and they jumped at the chance to invest across the border where the wages are lower. // In fact , Hong Kong businessmen have started so many factories in Guangdong that there are now an estimated two million Chinese workers in Guangdong employed by Hong Kong managers turning out television sets , toys and textiles . By comparison , there are only 800 , 000 factory workers in Hong Kong itself . In effect , Hong Kong annexed Guangdong , turning it into its back shop. // With the more liberal policies of the last few years , residents of Canton have also been able to buy Hong Kong newspapers , listen to Hong Kong radio stations and watch Hong Kong television . Hence many of the city ' s five million inhabitants viewed the events of Tiananmen Square on CNN , as broadcast by Hong Kong television. // " I saw what happened , " a taxi driver in his 20 ' s said . " Everybody here knows the Government is lying about how many students were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our leaders are a little crazy , that ' s what my friends and I think , " he said , committing another blasphemy . " Who doesn ' t want freedom ? " <> <> Local Leaders as a Buffer // Another part of Guangdong ' s formula for success has been that its provincial leaders acted as a kind of buffer , insulating the province from Beijing ' s periodic demands for obedience in return for hard work . This unofficial bargain showed in the way the student demonstrations were handled in Canton . Party officials say they struck a deal with student organizers to confine their marches to the evening , so the demonstrations would not interrupt factory or office work. // On the night of the first big march in Canton on May 4 , when students from Zhongshan University took until 3 A.M. to wind their way the 10 miles downtown , the police carefully arranged to have buses to take them back to school. // On June 7 , after the military crackdown in Beijing and even after local students had blocked one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police in Canton made their only arrests - 20 unemployed workers on the fringe of the demonstrators . Almost all of Canton ' s university students are now back in class , residents say. // Such seeming cooperation has raised charges that the Cantonese are only interested in making money . " People here aren ' t interested in talking politics , there ' s no money in it , " said a clerk in an antiques shop who came to Canton from Hunan Province . <> <> Fears of a Coming Purge // Nevertheless , there is fear the purge may make its way to Canton . It may be an inviting target . Mr. Zhao spent 16 years here as a provincial leader , he took a special interest in developing the strategy of rapid development of the southern coastal regions and several of the senior local officials are his proteges . Mr. Zhao ' s name even appears on a brass plaque as an honorary officer of a new golf course near the Hong Kong border. // If the party elders want to recentralize control over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such fears have led to a cutback in orders by Hong Kong businessmen for goods manufactured in Guangdong over the last three weeks , and this week three Hong Kong executives with factories in the province quietly put their investments up for sale , said Eric Kalkhurst , an American consultant based in Hong Kong . " They have made a lot of money in China but they want out , now , " he said. // Politics , however , has not yet intruded into the China Hotel , whose basement features a video game arcade , a bowling alley and a boutique selling French silk dresses and handbags , as well as the disco . All payments must be made in Foreign Exchange Certificates issued to foreigners only , but that does not slow local customers . A few yards from the hotel , young men offer to change dollars at the black market rate or find " ladies , " two ways of obtaining the coveted scrip. // On Monday night , the video games and bowling alley were mobbed , and two young Cantonese women with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the boutique . The average per-capita income in China is $300 . Fraternizing between Chinese women and foreign men is still illegal in China. // Outside the disco , the woman in the miniskirt was leaving . In her hand she carried the latest status symbol , a portable telephone . Its price was more than $3 , 000. //
