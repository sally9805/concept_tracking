This week 's cover stories mark a turning point in the life of a singular generation . The rebellious kids of the ' 60s who stoutly declared they would " never trust anyone over 30 " are themselves now turning 40 . Contemplating this occasion , TIME 's own aging Baby Boomers and their elders thought it provided a unique opportunity to reflect not only on the idiosyncrasies of a generation but on the many changes and tensions over the past several decades of American life . ( <P> The main architects of the cover stories admit that they saw themselves all too often in much of the reporting that poured in from around the country . Senior Editor Robert T. Zintl , 38 , conceived the idea of commemorating the 40th birthday of the first wave of Baby Boomers , enabling TIME staffers to pull together the disparate elements of the Baby Boom experience , from Hula- Hoops to the Viet Nam War , from jogging to two-income families . Says Zintl : " To me , the central issue was how these ' aging children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last face the responsibilities of being adults . " The father of two teenage girls , he adds , " I sometimes suspect that we may wind up as millions of ill-tempered senior citizens , complaining about our children and snarling , ' Do n't trust anyone under 70 . ' " Associate Editor Evan Thomas , 35 , who wrote the main stories with the assistance of Reporter-Researcher Jeannie Park , 24 , has firsthand knowledge of adult life as a Baby Boomer . " My own experience is n't different from that of those I wrote about , " says Thomas . " My wife , who 's a lawyer , and I had our first child at 30 . We are both struggling to manage full-time careers , rear our two daughters , who are toddlers , and see each other . It 's rewarding , but it 's hard to have it all . " <P> Though Baby Boomers are as diverse as members of any other generation , especially because theirs ranges in age from 40 down to 22 , Thomas believes there are strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the changing role of women . Says he : " My first editor at TIME was a woman . Before that , my boss on the Harvard Crimson was a woman . At law school , one-third of my class was female . In fact , I met my wife in civil-procedure class . " Had he belonged to the older generation , Thomas might have really believed that , as Rocker Cyndi Lauper says , " Girls just want to have fun .
