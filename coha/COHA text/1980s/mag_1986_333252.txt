The brave cadre of Europeans and Americans still living in West Beirut face the daily prospect of being kidnaped , knowing that at best they might spend months in isolated captivity , and at worst their bodies might be found somewhere in the bombed-out city 's rubble . Last week one potential hostage managed to avoid such a fate . <P> David Hirst , 50 , a correspondent for Britain 's daily Guardian , was hauled into a black BMW by three gunmen in Muslim West Beirut when the taxi in which he was riding stopped with a flat tire . Blindfolded and with a gun at his temple , Hirst shouted and kicked to attract attention as he was driven through the city , ignoring a gunman 's threats to shoot him if he did not desist . " I tried to make as much noise as I could , especially when the car stopped or slowed down at traffic jams , " he recounted . <P> When the car stopped in a southern suburb , Hirst , who had succeeded in removing the blindfold , forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , they did not shoot , " he marveled . Hirst , who then grabbed a taxi back to town , says he has not decided whether to stay in Beirut .
