How cons con the Government <P> When convicted pimp Sterling Godfrey walked out of the federal prison in Atlanta in 1977 , after serving nearly five years of a maximum 15-year term , he still owed his $35,000 fine . But Godfrey said he was short of cash , so the U.S. Attorney 's Ofiice in the capital obligingly allowed him to pay exactly $10 a month , thus giving him almost three centuries to pay his debt to society . Godfrey fell behind that undemanding schedule , even though the FBI discovered that he had re-established a lucrative prostitution business , opened a bicycle shop and acquired a Cadillac , a Mustang , a customized Dodge van and a motorcycle . <P> The Justice Department has a roster of some 18,000 federal cons who , all told , owe about $80 million in fines and bail bond forfeitures . Some of the deadbeats , among them many Prohibition moonshiners , are dead ; others are in prison , untraceable , or truly too poor to pay ( tightlipped Watergate Burglar G. Gordon Liddy , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice considers his pleas of poverty to be genuine ) . Yet the Department says that there are some 3,500 debtors who can claim no excuses . Their fines total about $20 million . <P> Haled before a federal district judge in Washington last week , and threatened with contempt of court , Godfrey agreed to begin paying off his fine at a rate of at least $50 a month during most of the year and $100 a month in the summers , when his bicycle business booms . Godfrey 's case followed a similar action against Gambler Alvin Kotz , who in January became the first person in Washington , and perhaps in the entire country , ever convicted of willful failure to pay a criminal fine . <P> <P> In 1973 Kotz was jailed for 30 months for gambling and fined $5,000 ; yet he said le could pay only $10 a month , because ae had to support his " aging Italian parents . " In fact , he managed to pay a mere $40 in six years , even though he went on gambling trips to Las @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Caesars Palace . Startled by the Kotz and Godfrey cases , the U.S. Attorney 's Ofiice in the capital has been reviewing its long list of cons in arrears . <P> Experts say that such delinquencies , which are a nationwide problem , could be curbed if judges handed out more sentences that prescribe imprisonment if fines are not paid by a certain date . They also urge that payment schedules be set up by judges rather than clerks in the U.S. Attorney 's Ofiice , who can be soft touches . It was a clerk who believed Godfrey in 1977 when he said he was " meeting expenses " while working for a group called Elements of Love .
