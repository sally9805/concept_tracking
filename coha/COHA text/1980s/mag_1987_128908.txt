The freak is dead ; long live the king of the freakin ' sidelines . That is , long live the Indiana Hoosiers and their excitable coach , Bob Knight , who beat LSU 77-76 to win the Midwest Regional . But also , long live those lovable knaves , Dale Brown and his ragtag Tigers , who used various versions of their " Freak " defense to come within a rushed shot by a guy with a Russian first name of sneaking back home as the regional champions themselves . // Alas , for all those Loose-ianians who kept up a screaming , profane dialogue with Knight at Cincinnati 's Riverfront Coliseum  --  they had n't forgotten the 1981 Final Four , when the Indiana coach slammed an LSU fan into a trash can  --  the Tigers ' Freak defense had no provision for placing barricades on the free throw line . That 's where Indiana 's Steve Alford swished 10 of 10 and his teammates 5 of 5 down the stretch . Nor did it take into account the homing-pigeon instincts of Cincy 's hometown boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip in the winning basket and final points of the courageous rally that brought the Hoosiers from 12 points behind in the second half . // Knight had raged his way to a first-half technical foul , slammed his fist on a court-side telephone , kicked a chair ( nearly sending a Hoosier player into orbit ) , cussed out NCAA tournament brass , exchanged epithets with an LSU student wearing Tiger-fur pants  --  " Wave that pompon at Knight again and I 'll shove it ... , " shouted the IU team doctor as he shoved the pompon back in Tiger-fur 's face  --  and made some key substitutions ; then he praised the Tigers . " As good a collection of athletes , playing hard ... " , Knight said . " Nikita Wilson could have ripped us apart . I never saw a guy turn and shoot so quick . " // Luckily for Indiana , when LSU had six seconds to go the length of the court for the winning basket after Calloway 's tip-in , the Tigers could not get the ball to Wilson quickly enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counted even if it had dropped . // Luckily for IU as well , LSU 's Brown , who over the weekend dropped references to Imelda Marcos , Rocky Marciano , the Titanic , Rasputin , Saturn , Bo Derek , Jim Bakker , Twiggy , Haiti , Anita Bryant , d ? j ? vu , voodoo and General MacArthur into his ramblings about the Freak and overcoaching , may have outsmarted himself by going to a delay offense too soon . Over the last 4:18 the Tigers , who had been outplaying Indiana by aggressively running and attacking the basket , did not take a single shot until Nikita 's nyet-cord effort after the buzzer. // With Anthony Wilson and freshman Fess Irvin hitting from outside to support Nikita ( 20 points ) down low , LSU had overcome a one-point halftime deficit to take a 63-51 lead with 12:24 left . When Calloway caromed an easy dunk into an out-of-bounds turnover at 4:38 , the Hoosiers were still behind 75-66 and looked dead in the ( Ohio ) river . // But it was the Tigers whose lungs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show for their last eight possessions . Stalling was not a totally stupid strategy . Not getting the ball to Nikita Wilson was . " Unstoppable , " Indiana center Dean Garrett ( 17 points , 15 rebounds ) had pronounced him . Said a relieved and grateful Knight , " They chose to eliminate Nikita. " // What is more , Indiana still had fouls to give . So while Hoosier sub Joe Hillman was making a gutty three-point fast break  --  " the play of the game , " said Knight , " a pinch-hit home run in the ninth "  --  to draw the Hoosiers to 75-71 , his teammates were scrapping and chasing and gambling for steals . // After 18 first-half points , Alford did n't score from the field , but when teammate Keith Smart drained two foul shots , the Hoosiers had nearly caught LSU anyway : 76-75 with 40 seconds remaining . After Calloway committed a foul and Irvin failed to Fess up  --  he missed the front end of a one-and-one  --  Indiana had the ball back with 26 seconds left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays , " said Knight , who eschewed a timeout . " Anyway , we were in the Freak offense. " // Daryl Thomas turned in the lane looking for contact from one of the Tiger big men , but he got none and his jumper hit nothing but air . However , a hand here , a tip there and finally Calloway sent the Hoosiers thataway  --  right into LSU 's backyard for the Final Four . // It was n't as if Indiana had to negotiate a mine field to reach the regional final . The Hoosiers had played their sub-regional games in Indianapolis before venturing to Cincinnati , which is a 150-mile drive from Bloomington and a scant 30 miles from Milan , Ind. , the tiny , but celebrated burg with the 1954 state championship team featuring the immortal Bobby Plump that inspired the hit film Hoosiers. // Moreover , Indiana was challenged in the regional by a threadbare duo of over-achievers . Duke opened the season gutted by graduation ; LSU was ninth in the SEC after five league games , which Brown nonetheless compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los dos amigos , Knight and his former Army point guard and Indiana graduate assistant , Duke 's Mike Krzyzewski , wearied of the hype surrounding their game even as Coach K ( the single syllable ) described Coach K ( the Polish version ) as his favorite player while Krzyzewski said it was an " honor " to play against Indiana . // " How many ways , " Krzyzewski said , " can I tell you that I love him and that we have a great relationship ? " // But on Friday , Indiana experienced a life-threatening 29-21 deficit to the Dookies before Knight switched Alford off the swift Tommy Amaker . In short order , Alford , now free to concentrate on his offense , racked up two baskets and handed out two assists , Indiana had 21 points ( while holding Duke to four ) , and the game was well on its way toward its 88-82 conclusion . // " LSU ? " said Baton Rouge native Smart of the team that had upset DePaul 63-58 on the strength of 24 Nikita Wilson points . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another game . " // That it was n't just another game could be attributed to the heart and soul of both teams . " The LSU Tigers , " Brown announced , " one of the truly great sports stories of all time . " It 's just a shame that they stopped playing before time ran out .
