It was a sudden strike that leaped live right out of the nightly news . At the precise moment that the three networks began airing their evening newscasts last Monday , U.S. attack planes were roaring toward their five Libyan targets . Out of the black Mediterranean night they came , racing through orange cones of frantic antiaircraft fire to punish the man Ronald Reagan calls the " mad dog of the Middle East . " As Americans , transfixed at their television sets , listened to the muffled rattle and thump of the assault filtering over the phone lines of network correspondents holed up in a Tripoli hotel , the U.S. attackers delivered their lethal cargo of laser-directed bombs . As quickly as they had come , the warplanes wheeled out to sea , vanishing back into the gloom , all safe but one . <P> Even for an Administration accustomed to making its moves with television coverage firmly in mind , the timing of the 7 o'clock strike was extraordinary . Ronald Reagan could hardly have written a more gripping script to dramatize his determination to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan took to the airwaves to explain and justify the raids , they had already been discussed  --  and generally applauded  --  at dinner tables across the land . <P> Actually , the schedule of Operation El Dorado Canyon , as the strikes were code-named by Pentagon planners , was dictated by the military necessity of hitting Libya in the middle of the night . It was just one factor in an enormously complex operation that involved 150 aircraft and resulted in the launching of more than 60 tons of bombs . The outcome was far from perfect : the U.S. lost one F-111 fighter-bomber along with its two-man crew and unintentionally caused some civilian casualties and damage . But El Dorado also produced more than a few nuggets of military gold , including severe damage to at least eight Soviet-built Libyan planes and Libyan Leader Muammar Gaddafi 's personal headquarters . " We did n't do everything right , " says Admiral William Crowe , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . But on balance , he maintains , the operation " was very successful .

At a National Security Council meeting on April 7 , the President clearly decided that the time for action had arrived . His command : " Try to make the world smaller for the terrorists . " <P> Though Reagan did not order up an air strike then and there , it was clear to military planners that such an action was inevitable . The Pentagon brass was concerned , however , that it lacked the firepower to hit Gaddafi with sufficient force . Since the Sixth Fleet 's skirmish only three weeks earlier with Libyan forces in the Gulf of Sidra , the fleet 's strength had considerably diminished with the departure of the aircraft carrier Saratoga for its home base in Mayport , Fla . There was not sufficient time to order the flattop back to the central Mediterranean to join the carriers Coral Sea and America .                  @ @ @
