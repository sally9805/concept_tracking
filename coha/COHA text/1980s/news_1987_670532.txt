But with the unexpected retirement of Justice Powell on Friday , the Supreme Court in its next term may become the Reagan Court . The President now has a chance not just to fill a third vacancy but to put conservatives firmly in control with a chance to act on such issues as abortion , affirmative action and religion. // The decisions of the 1986-87 term showed little deviation from the Court ' s direction in Warren E. Burger ' s 17 years as Chief Justice . The rulings were moderate to liberal on social issues like racial and sexual discrimination , abortion and church-state relations , more conservative on criminal law and civil liberties and moderate and pragmatic in its basic instincts. // Last year , when President Reagan picked Justice Rehnquist to replace Chief Justice Burger and Antonin Scalia , another strong ideological conservative , to take the Rehnquist seat , , many conservatives had hoped - and liberals had feared - that the Court would move perceptibly to the right. // But the Court did not move , and Chief Justice Rehnquist found himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined by the independent-minded Justice Scalia slightly less often than he had been by Mr. Burger . <> <> Strategic Place at the Center // Now , however , the Court has reached the tipping point , because the liberal victories in so many ideologically charged cases have been by one-vote margins , with Justice Powell in the majority. // As in the past , he was more often in the majority than any other member of the Court , especially in the major cases and the 5-to-4 decisions . His vote in those cases determined whether the conservative Chief Justice or the liberal wing symbolized by Justice William J. Brennan Jr. would win. // Justice Powell ' s strategic place at the dead center of the Court ' s sharp ideological divide , and his moderate , case-by-case approach to issues , made him the most appropriate symbol of the approach to the law taken by the Burger Court . <> <> The Split Decisions // Among the 5-to-4 decisions on which Justice Powell had a decisive impact were these cases : // * A decision in February upholding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use a strict racial quota , one black for one white , in promoting state troopers to make up for severe past discrimination against blacks. // * A decision this week that a clerical employee in a county constable ' s office had a First Amendment right not to be dismissed for saying she hoped President Reagan would be assassinated. // * A decision last week that emotionally charged evidence about the impact of a murder on a victim ' s family can not be presented at a death sentencing hearing because it might " inflame " the jury against the defendant. // In other cases , Justice Powell voted with the majority this term in major liberal victories on issues including teaching the theory of creation versus evolution in public schools , pregnancy leave , affirmative action preferences for women and minorities and discrimination against people with infectious diseases like AIDS. // Justice Powell also cast the crucial fifth vote to strike down a Pennsylvania law restricting abortion rights and to uphold the Federal courts ' authority to order racial preferences in hiring in order to remedy " egregious " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these cases , and the Reagan Administration , through legal briefs filed with the Court , was on the losing side in all but the death penalty case , in which it was not a party. // But Justice Powell did not always side with the Court ' s liberals . In fact , in 71 percent of the 87 cases on which Justice Brennan and Chief Justice Rehnquist disagreed , Justice Powell joined the Chief Justice . These included the vast majority of the criminal cases and some of the major decisions of the term . <> <> The Reagan Agenda // Among those were 5-to-4 decisions upholding Georgia ' s death penalty sentencing system despite statistical evidence of racial discrimination , allowing the use of the death penalty against murder accomplices who neither killed nor intended to kill and sharply limiting the powers of land-use regulators to appropriate private property for public use without compensation. // He also was in the majority in the landmark 6-to-3 decision upholding detention without bail of purportedly dangerous defendants. // But on the issues at the heart of the Reagan ideological agenda - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood solidly with the liberals in defending Supreme Court precedents against attacks by conservatives. // One paradoxical effect of the elevation of Justice Rehnquist to Chief Justice was that in several cases the liberals probably won more sweeping victories than they would have under the somewhat less consistently conservative Chief Justice Burger. // This was because Mr. Burger was said to vote sometimes with the majority in cases in which he really agreed with the dissenters , in order to preserve his power of assigning the majority opinion to himself or to someone else who would frame it narrowly . When the Chief Justice is in dissent , the senior member of the majority assigns the opinion. // Chief Justice Rehnquist , on the other hand , has not compromised his conservative principles in such a way . As a result , Justice Brennan , the Court ' s senior and most liberal member , has been able to assign more opinions. // He has used this to good advantage , assigning the two affirmative action cases and several other major rulings to himself and writing them in broad , liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rulings of the term that began last Oct. 6 . <> <> DISCRIMINATION // In its broadest endorsement yet of affirmative action , the Court ruled that employers may sometimes favor women and minorities over better-qualified men and whites in hiring and promoting to counteract statistical imbalances in their workforces. // The decision , rejecting a man ' s assertion that he had been a victim of illegal sex discrimination , was the first involving an affirmative action plan giving women preferences over men. // It was also the Court ' s first unambiguous holding that no proof of past discrimination by an employer against women or minorities was needed to justifify a voluntary affirmative action plan that discriminates in their favor , as long as it was narrowly tailored to correct statistical underrepresentation of those groups and as long as the adverse impact on white men was limited. // The vote to uphold the plan was 6 to 3 , but Justice Sandra Day O ' Connor did not join in Justice Brennan ' s majority opinion , which she said endorsed affirmative action too broadly . Justice Powell ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Brennan approach . ( Johnson v. Transportation Agency , No. 85-1129 . ) Together with the Alabama state trooper case and three decisions last year , two of which were decided by 5-to-4 margins , the Johnson decision completely shredded the Administration ' s broad legal attack on affirmative action . Justice Powell was in the majority in all five cases. // In a case of major importance to working women and employers , the Court ruled 6 to 3 that states may require employers to grant special job preferences to employees who are physically unable to work because of pregnancy , childbirth or related medical conditions. // Upholding a California law that requires employers to provide up to four months unpaid leave , the Court rejected arguments by the Administration and others that the law was pre-empted by a Federal law against pregnancy discrimination because it required benefits for pregnant employees that it did not require for others . ( California Federal Savings and Loan v. Guerra , No. 85-494 . ) In a 7-2 decision that could benefit many victims of AIDS , the Court ruled that recipients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physically or mentally impaired by tuberculosis and other infectious diseases unless they posed a real threat of infection to others or could not do their work . ( School Board v. Arline , No. 85-1277 . ) The Court ruled unanimously that Arabs , Jews , Hispanic Americans and members of other ethnic groups may sue under a post-Civil War law that prohibited racial discrimination in employment , housing and other contract and property rights . ( St. Francis College v. Al-Khazraji , No. 85-2169 ; Shaare Tefila Congregation v. Cobb , No. 2156 . ) Casting doubt on assertions by many private clubs that they had a constitutional right to exclude women from membership , the Court ruled 7 to 0 that states could outlaw such discrimination by Rotary Clubs . ( Board of Directors of Rotary International v. Rotary Club of Duarte , No. 86-421 . ) <> <> CRIMINAL LAW // In the Georgia death penalty decision , the Court ended the last sweeping , unresolved challenge to capital punishment , which could have invalidated the sentences of hundreds of the nearly 2 , 000 death row inmates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that killers of whites , especially black killers , were far more likely to be condemned to death than killers of blacks . But Justice Powell ' s majority opinion held that the statistics did not prove unconstitutional racial discrimination against any individual defendant . ( McCleskey v. Kemp , No. 84-6811 . ) In another 5-to-4 decision the Court held that the death penalty could sometimes be used against accomplices in crimes leading to death even if they did not personally kill or intend to kill . ( Tison v. Arizona , No. 84-6075 . ) The case cut back sharply on a 1982 precedent and could lead to much wider use of the death penalty. // The biggest consolation for opponents of capital punishment was the 5-to-4 decision barring the use in sentencing hearings of evidence regarding the impact of the murder on the victim ' s family . ( Booth v. Maryland , No. 86-5020 . ) The landmark ruling that Federal courts may jail criminal defendants before trial if they are deemed threats to public safety upheld a provision of the Bail Reform Act of 1984 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first broad endorsement of the constitutionality of preventive detention . ( United States v. Salerno , No. 86-87 . ) Overruling a major 1969 Supreme Court decision , the Justices broadened the jurisdiction of military courts-martial by holding that military personnel may be court-martialed even for crimes unrelated to their service . ( Solorio v. United States , No. 85-1581 . ) Defendants charged with betraying a public trust fared better in the Court than those charged with violent crimes . They succeeded in blunting the most potent weapon used by Federal prosecutors against political corruption at the state and local level , unions corruption and business fraud. // Rejecting the unanimous view of lower Federal courts , the Court ruled that those who defraud their victims of " intangible rights , such as the right to have public officials perform their duties honestly , " could not be prosecuted under the mail fraud statute and similar laws . ( McNally v. United States , No. 86-234 . ) In several narrower decisions , the Court continued its recent course of making it easier for the police to interrogate criminal defendants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which required that arrested suspects be told of their rights to remain silent and to have a lawyer present during questioning. // Several other decisions continued the a similar trend of making it easier for the police to search for evidence of crime . The Justices relaxed some of the complex rules under which lower courts had suppressed evidence on the ground that it was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment . And they broadened the immunity of officials from damage suits for illegal searches and seizures that they could reasonably have believed to be lawful . <> <> RELIGION // In a major blow to efforts by fundamentalist Christian groups to mold school curriculums , the Court ruled 7 to 2 that states may not require that the creationist theory of man ' s origins be given equal time in any public school that teaches the theory of evolution. // It struck down as an establishment of religion a 1981 Lousiana law requiring " balanced treatment " for " creation-science " in any school that taught evolution , saying the law ' s purpose was " to advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( Edwards v. Aguillard , No. 85-1513 . ) The Court unanimously upheld an act of Congress allowing nonprofit religious organizations to discriminate on religious grounds in hiring , even for secular jobs . The law allows hospitals , nursing homes , health clubs and other secular institutions run by religious groups to discriminate on religious grounds , despite the 1964 Civil Rights Act ' s general ban against such discrimination in employment . ( Corporation of the Presiding Bishop v. Amos , Nos. 86-179 and 86-401 . ) Citing the First Amendment guarantee of free exercise of religion , the Court ruled 8 to 1 in a Florida case that states may not deny unemployment benefits to employees who are dismissed for refusing to work on their Sabbath . ( Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Commission , No. 85-993 . ) <> <> ELECTIONS // Striking down a Connecticut law , the Court cleared the way for independent voters to take part in a political party ' s primary elections if the party wants them to do so. // The law limited voting in primaries to people previously enrolled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it violated the State Republican Party ' s First Amendment right to freedom of association . Since 1984 the party had sought to open its primaries to independents . ( Tashjian v. Republican Party , No. 85-766 . ) In another 5-to-4 election case , the Court ruled that a Congressional ban on direct corporate spending in political campaigns was unconstitutional as it was applied to a Massachusetts anti-abortion group and other small , nonprofit advocacy groups . ( Federal Eelection Commission v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life , No. 85-701 . ) <> <> FREE SPEECH // The decision in favor of the woman who had said she hoped President Reagan would be assassinated expanded somewhat the free speech rights of government employees . It was based on the Court ' s holding that the remark , which came in the context of her criticism of Mr. Reagan ' s cuts in welfare programs that benefit blacks , was protected " political speech . " ( Rankin v. <> <> McPherson , No. 85-2068. ) // The Court upheld , 5 to 3 , a Federal law classifying as " political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion on United States foreign policies . It said the law ' s terminology did not unconstitutionally inhibit free speech by persons wanting to show the film . ( Meese v. Keene , No. 85-1180 . ) <> <> PROPERTY RIGHTS // The Court handed property owners two major victories against land-use regulators at the local , state and Federal levels , in decisions that are certain to spur many lawsuits by owners complaining of overly burdensome regulation. // It ruled 6 to 3 that owners have a constitutional right to compensation from governments for regulations that deprive them even temporarily of all use of their land and are not limited to seeking court orders invalidating the regulations . ( First English Evangenical Lutheran Church v. County of Los Angeles , No. 85-1199 . ) On Friday , in a 5-to-4 decision involving California ' s regulation of beachfront properties , the Court restricted the power of governments to require people who seek permission to build on their own land to surrender part of their ownership rights for public use without compensation. // The Court said governments must pay compensation unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to offset burdens the new construction would place on the public . ( Nollan v. California Coastal Commission , No. 86-133 . ) <> <> SECURITIES LAW // In an important victory for companies seeking protection from hostile corporate takeovers , the Court , on a 6-to-3 vote , upheld for the first time a state law restricting hostile offers for companies incorporated there . The Indiana law could condition the voting rights of those making tender offers or otherwise increasing their holdings above certain levels on the approval of all other shareholders . ( CTS Corp. v. <> <> Dynamics Corp . , Nos. 86-71 and 86-97. ) // In a victory for the securities industry , the Court ruled 5 to 4 that firms may block customers from bringing fraud suits in Federal courts by using standard agreements that relegate all such disputes to arbitration .
