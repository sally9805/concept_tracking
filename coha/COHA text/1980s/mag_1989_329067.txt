Signs of America 's Old West start as far east as Adair , Iowa , where an old railroad wheel marks the spot on which Jesse James held up his first moving train in 1873 . Sweeping along the interstate at a sedate 65 m.p.h. , a westward-bound traveler may then dally at Omaha 's splendidly revitalized Old Market , which evokes gold seekers and prairie pioneers heading out aboard the Union Pacific railway circa 1865 . But by the time you reach Al 's Oasis at Oacoma , S. Dak. , on a bluff over the glistening Missouri River , all doubt vanishes as quickly as adherence to the speed limit on I-90 . The proud sign at Al 's , a pit stop featuring buffalo burgers and passable 5 cents coffee , unabashedly announces WHERE THE WEST BEGINS . <P> The legendary names and places pepper the maps of South Dakota , North Dakota and Montana , three Old West states currently celebrating 100 years of statehood . Trails are named the Lewis and Clark , the Bozeman , the Cheyenne- Deadwood ; names like Custer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Undaunted by the midsummer heat , the states have mounted an extravagant array of rodeos , cattle drives , river regattas and folk fests that will culminate in November . Enthusiastic tourism officials predict that the number of out-of- state license plates on the roads will top last year 's by as much as 10% . Roadside wax museums , water slides and reptile farms abound . Yet with some advance mapwork , visitors can reach well beyond familiar kitsch to centennial exhibits that speak directly to the westward movement and the nation 's astonishingly recent past . <P> Two wagon trains are constantly on the move in South Dakota , tracing a cross-country odyssey that will take them about 2,500 miles before they hook up at the state fair at Huron in late August . Manned by eager volunteers who drop in and out as their stamina and patience dictate ( no charge , all welcome ) , the trains cover up to 24 miles between overnight camps , where they circle in classic fashion . Some vehicles are older than the state itself . Some come from as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out each morning , cries of " Wagons ho ! " fill the air . " There 's no better way to see the scenery than looking between a horse 's ears , " says Bud Livermore , 67 , a retired South Dakota rancher who scouted the route for the western wagon train . <P> One of the most noticeable of the leathery wagoners is Dave Bald Eagle , 70 , a Northern Cheyenne and rancher who has clopped along with the 32-vehicle western train for 40 days . Bald Eagle , who intends to see the train out to the finish , dons his ceremonial regalia when the wagons enter some small towns . He dismisses the irony of a Native American traveling in a nostalgic procession of white folk , who were once fearful of Indian attack . " It 's my way of letting the Indian people know it 's best to cope with the modern world , to get busy , to do something , " he says .                  @ @ @
