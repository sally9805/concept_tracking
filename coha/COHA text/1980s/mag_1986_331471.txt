Only three sitting federal judges have ever been indicted for serious crimes , and until last week only one had been convicted ( Las Vegas Judge Harry Claiborne , found guilty in 1984 of filing false income tax returns ) . Now a second name has been added to that happily short list . A Hattiesburg , Miss. , jury found U.S. District Court Judge Walter L. Nixon Jr . guilty of two counts of perjury resulting from his intervention in a drug case against the son of a longtime friend . <P> Nixon , 57 , who sits in Biloxi as chief judge of the Southern District of Mississippi , was accused of accepting lucrative oil and gas royalties in return for helping persuade state authorities to drop marijuana-smuggling charges against his friend 's son . The jury in Hattiesburg , where the case was transferred , found the judge innocent of accepting an illegal gift and of one perjury charge , but guilty of lying to a grand jury when he denied having anything to do with the drug case or discussing it with the prosecuting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $20,000 fine for perjury . Even so , he can not be removed from the federal bench unless he is impeached by Congress .
