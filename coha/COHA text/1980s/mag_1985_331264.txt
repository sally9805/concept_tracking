The rebellious Republicans grew still after the President entered the room . Ronald Reagan had just returned from a memorial service at Fort Campbell , Ky. , and the pall carried over to the gathering on Capitol Hill . There was a moment of silence for the 248 soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division who died in the Arrow Air crash two weeks ago . Then it was down to business . More than 160 G.O.P. Congressmen were eager to explain why they had voted to prevent consideration of a bill drastically overhauling the nation 's tax code , and the President was just as eager to persuade them not to kill his " No. 1 " domestic priority and leave him crippled by a revolt in his own party . <P> The bill , the Republicans told Reagan , did not reflect his original tax- reform plan . It had been usurped and ideologically warped by the Democrats , they said . Reagan listened patiently . Then he pulled out a packet of index cards and began a prepared response . He understood the Congressmen 's concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were unchanged in the final version . But for the process to continue , the bill must be passed and sent to the Senate , where it could be improved . If killed in the House , there would be no second chance . <P> In the end Reagan showed yet again why it is foolhardy to underestimate his persuasive powers and prematurely proclaim him a lame duck . Despite the obituaries written after the Republican revolt six days earlier , the most far- reaching tax-reform plan since World War II passed the House last week and was sent to the Senate , which will take it up in 1986 . The surprising bipartisan triumph by Reagan and Democratic Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski came during the prolonged and hectic finale of a year otherwise distinguished chiefly by the achievement of new levels of fecklessness in dealing with , or failing to deal with , the federal budget process . <P> When the President launched his crusade for tax reform in May , he issued a challenge : " America , go for it . " But the sweeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyed warily by a Congress that often seems beholden to special-interest groups . In the House , Reagan formed an awkward alliance with Rostenkowski , who proceeded to bargain with colleagues to produce a bill that preserved the thrust of the President 's proposal but was speckled with special favors designed to make it politically palatable . <P> The House measure reduces the number of tax brackets from 15 to four , cutting the top rate from 50% to 38% , not quite the 35% Reagan had requested . In doing so , it preserves some politically popular deductions that the President had proposed doing away with , including mortgage payments on second homes and taxes paid to state and local governments . The personal exemption would be raised from $1,080 to $2,000 for taxpayers who do not itemize their deductions and to $1,500 for those who do . The bill would also impose a stiffer minimum tax on corporations and eliminate many business breaks . When Rostenkowski finally produced his version , Reagan vacillated for two weeks before issuing a lukewarm endorsement .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
