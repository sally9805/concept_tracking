Spike Lee ' s independent feature " She ' s Got ta Have It " belongs to a rapidly expanding new art house genre : It ' s bright , bouncy and superficial at the same time it tries to treat a relatively serious subject . These films seem to flourish in the specialized theaters during the summer , a sort of " lite art "  --  including such movies as " Letter to Brezhnev , " " Sincerely , Charlotte " and " A Great Wall "  --  that goes down with one-third less calories . The heavier brew gets saved for fall , by which point , presumably , we ' ll be more prepared to accept some substance with our style . Nola ( Tracy Camila Johns ) is a tall and lovely young black New Yorker . She enjoys sexual variety too much to settle down to a long-term , monogamous relationship , so she keeps three men on her leash . Jamie ( Tommy Redmond Hicks ) is a dedicated romantic who writes sticky love poems and begs Nola to marry him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who offers Nola the material pleasures of a built-up body , a flashy car and evenings out in chic night spots . Mars ( played by director Lee himself ) is a motor-mouthed street character who keeps Nola laughing with elaborate , pleading raps delivered deadpan from behind a huge pair of chrome- plated aviator ' s glasses . In other words , soulfulness , worldly success and wit , all revolving around the flame of beauty . Nola enjoys each of her lovers in a different way , and her refusal to commit herself drives her suitors crazy . There is something classical about this allegorical , four-cornered romance . Indeed , the structure is quite close to Jean Renoir ' s " Elena et les Hommes " ( a movie that Lee would have had the opportunity to encounter during his years at New York University ' s celebrated film school ) . But where Renoir goes beyond allegory , filling in the psychologies of his deliberately stereotypical characters , Lee is largely content to let his stereotypes be stereotypes . Only his own character acquires much independent life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in seduction , and  --  unlike Woody Allen , who plays a similar role in his films  --  he isn ' t afraid to acknowledge his prowess . Mars is a happy hustler , and his enjoyment of himself is infectious . Every allegory requires a moral , and Lee isn ' t shy about providing one of his own . Although each of the suitors complains about Nola ' s lack of emotional generosity , it soon becomes clear that their " sensitivity " only disguises an old-fashioned urge to control her . But Lee doesn ' t let this observation emerge naturally from the action . He places it straight in the mouths of his characters , who are allowed to directly address the audience . The meaning of the movie has been pre- determined and pre-digested . There ' s no room for spontaneity in the story-telling and no opportunity for the viewer to formulate his or her own observations . All of the work has been done for us , which , perhaps , is exactly what " lite art " is all about . As Nola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recently reissued Jim Thompson novel says succinctly , " a swell-looking babe , " yet she doesn ' t have the film actress ' crucial ability to connect with the camera . But Lee is a gifted technician , and his rapid pacing and imaginative editing cover a lot of the material ' s sluggishness . The film ' s funniest sequence is also its fastest : a rapid-cut montage that shows a series of men presenting their favorite come-on lines . Lee may not yet have the ability to sustain a full-length film ( " She ' s Got ta Have It " is the 29-year-old ' s first feature ) , but he can be brilliant in 30-second bursts .
