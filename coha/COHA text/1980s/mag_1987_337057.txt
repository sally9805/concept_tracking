It 's dawn in the Midwest , and Jane Craig , network-news producer on location , is already hard at work . She jogs outside her motel past a phalanx of newspaper machines and buys a copy of every available paper . She phones her colleagues awake in other motel rooms  --  thank heaven , two of them are married , saves a call . She indulges a pal 's dead-on impression of Arnold Schwarzenegger . Then she unplugs the phone , sits on her bed and has a good cry : heaving shoulders , racking sobs , a face contorted into a bruised fist , a doll in tears because no one will buy her . Is this person in control ? Perfectly . There is no wasted motion or emotion in this petite dynamo . Jane has simply , in the words of the actress who portrays her , " penciled in times to cry . " <P> Holly Hunter touches all of Jane 's moods  --  funny , flinty , vulnerable , bizarrely controlled  --  before the opening credits of Writer-Director James L. Brooks ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display seems the equivalent of a Save the Children billboard on Sunset Strip : " Wo n't someone please nominate this girl for an Oscar ? " But Hunter , 29 and 5 ft. 2 in. , is no late entry in the prima donna sweepstakes . She is a hardscrabble sprite from Conyers , Ga. , a dues payer from off-Broadway ( Beth Henley 's The Miss Firecracker Contest ) and off-Hollywood ( Joel and Ethan Coen 's Raising Arizona ) whose only eccentricity , says Joel Coen , " is how easy she is to work with . " She has built a boutique gallery of daft characters : nymphets and star children who swagger like cowgirls . And now she stars in the most coveted role in the year 's smartest entertainment . When Broadcast News opens this week , Hollywood will stop asking ( as Brooks did two days before he hired her ) " Who is Holly Hunter ? " and start demanding " Get me Holly Hunter ! " <P> In Brooks ' beguilingly skeptical romance , Jane is the Lois Lane of the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clark Kent reporter ( Albert Brooks ) and a flawed Superman-anchorman ( William Hurt ) . The male leads had long been cast , but until just before rehearsals , Jim Brooks was still looking for his " little steamroller . " Debra Winger , who had shone in his Terms of Endearment , was pregnant and unavailable . Sigourney Weaver , Mary Beth Hurt , Christine Lahti , Judy Davis  --  all were fine , but nobody was right . <P> Then Hunter stepped into the glass slipper . " Why should I be nervous ? " she recalls thinking as she walked into a Manhattan hotel suite to meet Jim Brooks and Bill Hurt . " There was no way in hell I was going to get this role . " Within moments , Brooks thought otherwise . " She read her part like a dream , " he says . " No , wait , I 'm building legends here . She read better than a dream . She read like a gifted actress . " And once this non-star got the part , she assumed a control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her is that Holly never questioned that this was exactly where she should be , " Brooks observes . " She gives it everything all the time . She floors it and goes till she drops . "
