txt  | an unbroken inner connection between social rank and religious condition . " For the Balinese , " worldly status has a cosmic base , . . . hierarchy is the governing principle of the universe , and . . . the arrangements of human life are but approximations , more close or less , to those of the divine . " On the question of mobility , Geertz claims that " slave for a few unusual exceptions , mobility between levels within the Balinese prestige system is in theory impossible and in practice difficult " ( 1959:996 ) . Both Goris ( n.d. ) and Swellengrebel ( 1969 ) mention instances of vertical mobility , downward as well as upward , but except perhaps for the change of status of a low-caste woman who marries up , the instances seem to be few . In spite of the allegedly hereditary or ascriptive nature of rank , competition between nobles is intense . This competition has its most elaborate expression in rituals , ceremony , pomp , politesse , and courtesy , but in violence too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruling obsessions of Balinese culture were social inequality and status pride , " says that affairs of state took on a theatricality " in which kings and princes were the impresarios , the priests the directors , and the peasants the supporting cast , stage crew , and audience .... Court ceremonialism was the driving force of politics . " Elsewhere he says that " the ceremonial life of the classical Balinese state was as much a form of rhetoric as it was of devotion , a florid , boasting assertion of spiritual power " ( Geertz 1980:102 ) . As in Balinese culture , in politics " status was the ruling obsession , " and ritual and ceremonial " splendor was the stuff of status " ( Geertz 1980:123 ) . The " motor " of the state was ceremony ( Geertz 1980:129 ) . In addition to competition through ritual and ceremony , a " steady hum of political violence ... plagued the Balinese state " ( Geertz 1980:85 ) . The exuberant development of religion and ritual on Bali is almost too well known to warrant comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with nobility and the courts deserves stress . Describing the relationships between Balinese courts , Geertz ( 1980:16 ) says , " The whole structure was based . . . primarily on ceremony and prestige . " The assiduous ritualism of court culture was . . . not merely the drapery of political order , but its substance " ( Geertz 1980:32 ) . Later ( 1980:62 ) he says that the Balinese state was " a ceremonial order of precedence " and that " there was an elaborate status ethic of honor and politesse , a kind of chivalric code minus horse , homage , and romantic love ( but not pride , pomp , and passion ) which hound all the great and near-great figures into that sort of baronial community in which etiquette has the fierce of law and even maleficence must be drenched in courtesy " ( Geertz 1980:40 ) .  | Finally , Geertz 's main argument is that the Balinese state was one of theatricality ? its ritual , pomp , and splendor were the very essence of its politics ( 198o ) . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be studied in terms appropriate to Western politics . Yet the resemblance of Bali not only to India but also to medieval Europe ( see especially Huizinga 1924 1950 ) is too remarkable to have resulted from accident . The resemblance includes not only historiographic quality and mode of social stratification but also a substantial portion of the other concomitants too . The Makassarese and Buginese are related peoples living in the southwest of the island of Sulawesi ( Celebes ) in Indonesia . Since the seventeenth century they have been Muslims , and they have long been oriented toward the sea as traders and fishermen . At the core of their accounts of the past is a tradition of chronicles , called pattorioloang ( Mak. ) or attoriolong ( Bug . ) . The literal meaning of the term is " the things concerning the people of former times " ( Noorduyn 1965:140 n . I ) . Although the chronicles refer to events dated as early as the sixteenth century , none of them appears to have been written before the seventeenth ( Noorduyn 1961,1965 ) . Noorduyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was probably an indigenous development , certainly not likely to have been derived from Malay or Javanese historiography . The chronicles are written in simple prose ; they are terse , objective , matter-of-fact , and relatively short ( Noorduyn 1961 , 1965 ) . Although dates are rare , an overall chronological order is maintained in that each main chapter refers to a single king 's reign . Each chapter follows a more or less fixed sequence of topics , including the ruler 's names , tides , and appanages ; important events in his life ; the number of years in his reign ; wars ; kings and places he subdued ; his wives and children ; sometimes new techniques or customs introduced ; an appreciation of the king 's character and capacities ; a notice of his death ; and his posthumous name ( Noorduyn 1965 ) . This format bears considerable resemblance to that of Muslim royal biographies ( cf. Rosenthal 1968 ) , in spite of Noorduyn 's opinion that Makassar/Buginese historiography developed independently . The chronicles contain very little in the way of myth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical writing . Some of the earliest portions of ' the chronicles are mythical , but the authors seem  | clearly to disassociate themselves from the myths ( Noorduyn 1965 ; Soedjatmoko 1965a ) . Although the chronicles are mostly about kings and princes , they are generally treated as ordinary human beings who by birth and position are the leading forces in history " ( Andaya 1979:360 ; see also Noorduyn 1961 ) . The sources of the chronicles appear to have been diaries of kings and private individuals . Some of these diaries have been preserved , even some written by Malays living in Makassar . But diaries seem to be peculiar to South Sulawesi , or to peoples under its cultural influence ; none were known from Malaya or Java ( Noorduyn 1961 , 1965 ) . Rudimentary archives were also present , at least in the Makassarese kingdom of Goa , where a chancellor was officially charged with keeping treaties ( Noorduyn 1961 ) . Noorduyn ( 1965:154 ) describes the people of South Sulawesi as possessing " a keen interest in this world and its affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objectivity and concern for facts shown in the chronicles of the Makassar/Bugis appeared " in other domains as well , as is shown by the annotations on maps for navigators , the precise data about weapons , houses , ships , etc. , in notebooks , and the inventories drawn up by administrators of estates . " In a minor way , one is reminded both of the secular humanism and this-worldliness of the Renaissance . Taking a comparative perspective , Soedjatmoko ( 1965a:xix ) lists the strengths of Makassar/Bugis historiography and observes that it therefore differed " strikingly from Javanese historiography . " Andaya ( 1979:361 ) , who has himself worked with the indigenous materials of the Makassar/Bugis world , cites a number of scholars who " expressed great admiration for the historical sense of the Bugis/ Makassar people . " At one point Noorduyn ( 1961 ) merely ranks the importance of their historiography with that of the Malays and Javanese , but the general impression he and others give is that Makassar/Bugis historiography is unusually sound for the insular Southeast Asian world . According to Chabot 1950 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and commoners . Bonds of patron to client link the former to the latter , but these bonds may be established or broken at will . The individual ties between karaeng and their followers do not give rise to clearly defined strata ; if asked his rank , virtually any Makassarese will claim that he or his kin group is aristocratic . While rank is considered to he based largely on descent , it is also based on personal qualities : ancient sources sanction high status for the wealthy , the learned , the courageous man . Since all , or virtually all , kin groups consider themselves to he of high status , all arc engaged in a struggle to assert their rank over others .  | Marriage is one of the principal arenas of this struggle . Men are expected to try to raise their rank ? through wealth , violence , or scholarship , or through simply assuming the behavior of aristocrats ? and women are expected not to let their rank fall . If a man shows the appropriate personal qualities , he may properly marry above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before a kin group previously considered to be of the rank of commoner is thereby fully accepted as nobility ( Chabot 1950 ) . At least one of the Bugis states , Wadjo , lacked even a hereditary kingship ( Noorduyn 1961 ) . A very recent study of the Bugis ( Millar 1983:478 ) says that they have " an apparently time-honored cultural preoccupation with social location ' ( knowing one 's hierarchical position with respect to all other individuals ) , " and that this preoccupation is " in terms of a dynamic tension between ascriptive and achieved status . " The Bugis are intensely concerned with rank , and it is largely hereditary . Yet they also have highly developed notions of how fate ( takdir ) and the judicious nurturance and balancing of one 's bateng and lahiring ( which I will gloss as inner and outer character , though this is a simplification ) allow for upward mobility . A commoner man may thereby achieve the highest rank in Bugis society , may properly marry a noble woman , and may see his children accepted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidents of individuals marrying above their level of ascribed rank are at the heart of the dynamic tension in Bugis society " ( 1983:483 ) . We should note , however , that upward mobility is not itself an ideal ; achieving a proper balance between inner and outer character is . But the effect is much the same . " The greater variety of possible resolutions to the effort to achieve a lahiring/bateng balance , and the constant ambiguity with regard to the lahiring/bateng balances of others , gives to Bugis society the remarkable dynamism for which it is well known throughout Indonesia " ( Millar 1983:48o-81 ) . While Millar describes Bugis preoccupation with rank as " apparently time-honored , " it is of course only speculation that the complex of ideas and behavior she describes was generally characteristic of the Makassar/Buginese peoples of the past . Noorduyn ( 1965:147n ) quotes Chabot to the effect that the whole of South Sulawesi is characterized by opposition " among individuals or groups , more or less manifestly directed at the enlargement of their prestige and power . " This implies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the area 's history than its ethnography ? apparently has no reservations about projecting this state of affairs into the past . In sum , social mobility , though perhaps culturally couched in peculiar ways , is a  | preoccupation of the Makassarese , and the pattern appears to be old , although hereditary claims to rank are acknowledged too . The " tension between ascriptive and achieved status " that Millar ( 1983:478 ) speaks of has its counterpart , as will be seen , among various historically minded peoples . It is instructive to compare Javanese with Makassar/Bugis ideas on matters closely related to the possibility of social mobility . Soedjatmoko describes " the ahistorical view of life , . . . couched in the terms commonly used in the Javanese cultural tradition , where they are stated more explicitly than elsewhere in Indonesia , " as follows : The ahistorical outlook on life ... perceives life and the flow of human events as a process beyond human control and therefore beyond human responsibility . ... The question of man 's ability and responsibility to influence the . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only thing he can do is fulfill his dharma , play out the part assigned to him in accord with that station in the order of things into which he was born . ( 1965b:4o9 ? io ) By contrast , Andaya ( 1979 ) analyzes a traditional village tale ( based on the hero of an actual event in the seventeenth century ) that was still popular in Makassar in the 19705 . Among the " traditional values " expressed in the tale was one called in Makassarese sare ( in Buginese were ) , which translates as one 's fate , or one 's destiny ( Andaya 1979:369 , 378 ) . The uses of this term , in the tale he analyzes , " clearly indicate that one achieves one 's sare through one 's own action in life " ( 1979:369 ) . It is a folk tale he analyzes , not one of the court chronicles on which the reputation of Makassar/Bugis historiography rests , but by the use of the term traditional , Andaya implies that the concept of sare existed in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the chronicles . The indicators all point in the direction of an open society . For more than a millennium Vietnam was an " integral part of the Chinese empire " ( Hall 1964:184 ) . For nearly the next millennium , until the French gained control of Indochina , Chinese remained the official language of Vietnam . Vietnam 's historical writings and social order show considerable Chinese influence . As I remarked earlier , it was the contrast between Vietnamese and  | Javanese historiography that led Hall to ask why some of the peoples of Southeast Asia had an idea of history while others did not . Moreover , Malleret 1961 notes various ways in which Vietnamese historiography was superior to that of Laos and Cambodia . And because of the ordered chronology of Vietnamese history , " long periods of time can ... be surveyed with much more assurance than is possible with the earlier history of other parts of Southeast Asia " ( Wolters 1976:204 ) . The author 's judgments on Vietnamese historiography in Honey 1961 are uniformly negative , but it is clear that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilizations but from the perspective of modern Western historiography . In fact , he gives considerable evidence that the Vietnamese were very sound historians by Southeast Asian standards . Johns ( 1976:306 ) lists some of the conditions that must be met for historical writing to develop and adds that these conditions " almost by definition " did not exist in Southeast Asia ? except in Sinicized Indochina . Chandler ( 1979:208 ) compares Vietnam with Cambodia and Thailand , and says that historical writing was never " as honoured or as popular " among the latter as among the former . Finally , Marr ( 1979:313 ) says that the " Vietnamese take history very seriously , possibly more so than anyone else in Southeast Asia . This is not a new characteristic , nor is it limited to the educated elite . " The consensus on the relative soundness of Vietnamese historiography is considerable . Both official and private histories were written in Vietnam , the former by mandarins of the court at the ruler 's request , the latter by private scholars . The earliest extant official history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventeenth centuries . Relatively few of the private histories have survived , but the earliest , a " Brief History of Annam " by Le Tac , dates from the thirteenth century . The principal official histories order events on a reign-by-reign basis and tend to treat preceding dynasties harshly while inflating the current one . Like the official histories , private histories also follow a chronological order and give little in the way of causes or motives . There is little evaluation of source materials ( Honey 1961 ) . In addition to the official histories , Vietnamese mandarins produced four other kinds of material of historical value : ( 1 ) " collections of administrative and legislative documents , " ( 2 ) imperial family genealogies , ( 3 ) " accounts of the doings of an emperor and his forebears , " and ( 4 ) " biographies of outstanding Vietnamese men and women . " In more recent times geographical treatises were produced too ( Honey 1961:96 ) . Due to disturbed conditions , the documentation that has survived from before  | the seventeenth century is minimal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept by the Vietnamese , but even in the eighteenth century there were no institutional provisions for maintaining them in an orderly fashion ( Honey 1961 ; Malleret 1961 ) . The use of archives for historical criticism was not common , and the critical spirit in general was weak ( Malleret 1961 ) . In spite of these criticisms of Vietnamese preservation of records , Malleret notes that by comparison there was no official care given to the conservation of documents in Cambodia or Laos . Moreover , " there is no evidence in these countries , as there is in Vietnam , of great scholars or compilers who have left precise accounts of the state of early archives " ( Malleret 1961:305 ) . This actually speaks very strongly on behalf of Vietnamese historiography and suggests that Vietnam had some of the best archives in Southeast Asia . According to Wolters ( 1979:83 ) , Vietnamese cited Chinese historical records because they " were seen to contain valuable practical guidance on matters connected with the welfare of rulers . " They " embodied the welltested " and " practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like encyclopedias , to be consulted when apparently relevant to specific situations , such as imperial succession ( Wolters 1979 ) . According to Marr ( 1979:317 ) , history served the Vietnamese primarily to reinforce ethical and religious principles , but also " historians often served the monarch by searching texts and records for precedents on problems of political , economic , or military policy . " Because Vietnamese historians believed that the " past contained lessons for the present and the future , " historians shaped their accounts of the past in order to teach lessons ( Wolters 1976:204 ) . No doubt this did not always have beneficial results , but Wolters ( 1976 ) gives an extended analysis of how the historian Le Van Huu , in the thirteenth century , composed history to draw a lesson concerning dynastic structure and orderly succession to the throne . A rudimentary sociopolitical analysis is indicated . In addition to dynastic national histories , " many local families kept careful genealogical and biographical records " ( Marr 1979:313 ) . Biography was very popular in French Vietnam , but collections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Marr 1979 ) . Marr ( 1979:316 ) suggests that divination in China and Vietnam were very similar : " Heaven and humanity were linked together by an abundance of omens . " Having been under intense Chinese influence for nearly two thousand years , many Chinese social and political practices were adopted in Vietnam . Among these adoptions was the bureaucratic examination system , which  | gave ? ideally , at least ? institutional backing to meritocracy ( McAlister and Mus 1970 ; Woodside 1971 ) . These examinations were introduced by the eleventh century and were being held regularly by the mid-moos ( Wolters 1979 ; Woodside 1971 ) . In a comparison of England and Vietnam in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries , Smith ( 1976 ) noted that there had never been a feudal nobility in Vietnam and that in spite of strenuous efforts , each Vietnamese clan that seized the throne tended to lose it fairly quickly to another clan . In at least one period , however , one clan held not only the throne but most high offices ( Wolters 1976 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a closed society . In the nineteenth century , but " using classical materials , popular scholar poets . . . expounded the idea that men , all men , have the potentiality of changing first themselves , and then external reality " ( Marr 1979:318 ) . Borrowing a Chinese proverb , the Vietnamese said , " Nobody stays rich for three generations ; nobody stays poor for three generations " ( McAlister and Mus 1970:33 ) . D.G.E. Hall , who had a deep familiarity with the Burmese , said that their chroniclers had a critical attitude when compared to the Javanese ; he also noted that Burmese chronological treatment was " careful " ( Hall 1961a:5 ) . Luce ( 1976:36 ) says cautiously that Burmese histories are " not valueless , " at least after the fourteenth century . Early Western historians of Burma gave the indigenous sources high marks ( Hall 1961b ; Tet Htoot 1961 ; Tin Ohn 1961 ) . One of them , G. E. Harvey , said of Burma : " No other country on the mainland of Indo-China can show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate dates goes back no less than nine centuries and even the earlier legends have a stratum of truth " ( quoted by Tin Ohn 1961:90 ) . U Tet Htoot ( 1961:50 ) thinks that the Burmese chronicles can be compared with Elizabethan chronicles . He also notes that the stated purposes of the Burmese chronicles was " to give moral instruction on the art of government to kings , ministers , generals , envoys , and other government officials " ( Tet Htoot 1961:50 ) . These uses are widely associated with sound historiography and show its relationship to political science . Indeed , Sangermano ( 1183 ; 1969:181 ) , who lived in Burma in the late eighteenth and earhv nineteenth centuries , said of written works " which certain wise men composed lilr the instruction of ' the Emperors , and the  | direction of young men , " that they presented " principles of political science , not only sound and reasonable , but nearly of the same nature as those which are known among us as the Machiavelian . " The authors of Burmese chronicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Tet Htoot 1961 ) . A great many inscriptions have been left by the Burmese . Though often religious in reference , they are factual and lack the " Indian flamboyance and exaggeration " ( Luce 1976:37 ) . They are good sources but were rarely used by Burmese historians ( Luce 1976 ) . Father Sangermano ( 1833 1969:156 ) said that " it may . . . be put down among the good qualities of this people , that they consider all men as equal in condition . " Officials and monks , when in office or in the order , are treated with great respect , but " when deposed , " or " when they throw off the habit , are regarded with no peculiar marks of distinction . " A small number of outcaste statuses were , however , of very low and sometimes hereditary rank . Social mobility was sometimes spectacular : " it is a frequent occurrence here for a man to be raised in a moment , by the caprice of the monarch , from the lowest state of poverty and degradation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1833 1969:152 ) . Writing toward the end of the nineteenth century , Scott essentially confirms what Sangermano said ( Yoe 1963 ) . The Burmese , Scott said , are very rank conscious and sharply divide their populace into ranked categories . But position in these ranks is determined not by birth but by merit ? theoretically , merit achieved in previous lives . The Burmese even have a tradition that their kings were once chosen strictly according to merit earned in previous lives rather than hereditarily . " The Buddhist religion is thoroughly democratic " ( Yoe 1963:407 ) . " All distinction came from office , or from a special patent from the king " ( Yoe 1963:409 ) . This is not quite true , however , because lower provincial officials , thugyi , enjoyed hereditary succession to their offices ( Hall 1950:134 ) . Burmese monastic education was open to all boys , which accounted for a high rate of literacy ( Yoe 1963 ) . In sum , there were hereditary elements in the Burmese social system : the kingship , a relatively small number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burmese the system was open , ideologically and actually . Malleret ( 1961 ) says of the Cambodians ( and the Laotians ) that they were not so assidulnls as the Vietnamese in maintaining records . The comparison  | of Cambodia with Vietnam is meaningful , since their sizes and durations are similar . By the time the French established themselves in Cambodia , in the nineteenth century , the Cambodians " had already fallen back upon fiction , to the extent that they attributed the construction of the Angkor monuments to the gods , and allowed the names of great kings ... to be buried in oblivion " ( Malleret 1961:305 ) . While not explicit or comparative , this implies considerable unsoundness in Cambodia 's historiography . In the colonial period , says Chandler ( 1979 ) , foreigners showed more interest in Cambodian history than did Cambodians . Vickery 1979 argues that the Cambodian chronicles were perhaps conceived as part of the royal regalia and hence were written during periods of royal restoration . As late as this century , Vickery reports , the Cambodians saw written history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical . The chroniclers were normally very casual about accuracy , and their writings were just as normally neglected " until a time of stress directed attention to them " again ( Vickery 1979:153 ) . The Cambodian chronicles were always written , but they showed little concern for nuances of language and hence were of little interest as a literary genre . They purport to be true and have a clear context of time and place ( Vickery 1979 ) . The chronicles were neither for recitation nor for entertainment . They tended to a flat recital of events and an accurate recording of kingly ceremonial , while suppressing the personality of the author . " Historians outside the palace were not meant to read the chronicles , and neither was the general public " ( Chandler 1979:209 ) . Vickery compares various texts from Cambodia and from the nearby Thai kingdom of Ayudhya to show that the historical events presented for Cambodia 's fourteenth century are actually sixteenth-century events moved backward to make Cambodia 's history as long as Ayudhya 's . The first 15o years of Cambodian history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Vickery 's analysis is correct , it indicates a general carelessness about historical preservation in Cambodia , and it is a case of the sort of falsification that earns a historiographic tradition poor marks . However , the only comparative judgment actually made by the historians cited here was that Cambodia 's record keeping was not as good as Vietnam 's . For six centuries Cambodia has been a predominantly Buddhist country , its Buddhism being the Hinayana form as found on Sri Lanka and in Burma and Thailand . But before Buddhism achieved dominance in Cambodia , I Iinduism had a very strong hold there , and certain aspects of caste , or at any rate of the rarna system , have shown an unusual tenacity in the country .  | The Hinduization of Cambodia during its period of greatness , from the tenth to the fourteenth centuries , is extensively documented in Briggs 1951 . This work cites numerous and detailed epigraphical references to the Brahman and Kshatriya varna , to clans ( gotra , usually if not always matrilineal ) within the Brahman varna , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereditary elite . References to the lower-ranking varna are , however , rare or absent . The inscriptions make it clear that one of the Angkorian kings ' principal duties was to insure " domestic peace by imposing on everyone the obligation to respect the social order , that is the division between the various castes " ( Coedes 1968:119 ) . Coedes 1966 describes of the Brahmans and the princes ( Kshatriya ) as forming a class apart . Hall ( 1964:102 ) speaks of a " narrow oligarchy " in ancient Cambodia , composed of intermarrying royal and sacerdotal families who " formed a class racially different from the rest of the population " and who embodied the Hindu tradition . Cady ( 1964:101 ) also describes the Brahmans and Kshatriya as composing an intermarrying upper class that was " closed to many on racial as well as cultural grounds , " and with rigid rules prohibiting relations between it and commoners . Insofar as these remarks indicate Hinduization , they would not differ greatly from what could be said of many old Southeast Asian kingdoms . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unusual degree . The literary quality of the Sanskrit epigraphy in Cambodia is excellent in all periods ; the study of the Hindu classics was patronized ; full knowledge of the Hindu epics and of the philosophies and mythologies of the various Hindu sects was consistently displayed ; and " Cambodia was uniquely productive in examples of original contributions to Sanskrit literature " ( Cady 1964:100 ) . We do not , of course , know the extent to which caste regulations were actually applied ( Cady 1964:1011 says they " did not strictly apply " ) , nor do we have any sort of quantitative knowledge of social mobility . But the evidence of caste in an Indian form is strong . It should be recalled that Cambodia 's Hinduized age of greatness is known to us only through epigraphy , archaeology , and the study of historical sources from outside Cambodia . The later indigenous chroniclers knew nothing of the period . Aymonier 1900 describes conditions in Cambodia around 188o , about fifteen years after the French established a protectorate over it . Royalty were called the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descent to a reigning monarch in less than five generations . More distant descendants of former monarchs ( unless of course they could trace royal descent in fewer generations to a subsequent monarch ) dropped into the  | next lower " caste , " the Brahman van . The latter were almost identical to royalty but had no right to the throne . The Brahman van transmitted their status patrilineally and had their own officials to regulate their affairs . They ranked next to the ministers of state , and the " chief of the entire hierarchy of mandarins " ( a position not then filled ) could only be appointed from among the Brahman van ( Aymonier 1900:63-64 ) . In addition to royal descendants there were Brahmans , descended not from royalty but from ancient Brahmans . These were called Bram , Brahmana , or Pago ( pronounced " bakou " ) . These numbered in the hundreds of families . They too now reckoned descent patrilineally . They were particularly associated with the post of guardian of the royal sword ( an item of great symbolic significance ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from corvee and taxes , and were regulated by their own chiefs , who were selected by the king from among them . Aymonier describes these chiefs as the only priests in the country , mostly involved in court ritual . The Brahman chiefs could marry princesses . It was widely believed that only a Brahman ( not a Brahman van ) could be chosen as king if the royal line died out , because the Brahmans were truly of the highest caste . In spite of their caste organization , the Brahmans were Hinayana Buddhists ( Aymonier 1900 ) . Beneath the royalty ( i.e. , the Brahman vansa and Brahman van , roughly coinciding with the Kshatriya of ancient Cambodia ) and the Brahmans there were no further hereditary ruling elements . The mandarins , that is , the bureaucrats , held office for life but did not in theory pass on their offices to their sons . But since their sons served as pages in the court , they did in fact tend to follow their fathers in office . The mandarins numbered about one thousand . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous ( Aymonier 1900 ) . Aymonier 's account of nineteenth-century social stratification in Cambodia is remarkably reminiscent of ancient times . Coedes ( 1968 ) equated the Brahmans of the present with those of six centuries earlier in Cambodia ? a caste holding out in spite of Buddhism . Munson et al . ( 1963 ) provide a more recent description of social stratification in Cambodia , and it is little changed from the earlier descriptions . Rank is important to Cambodians , and " through the society runs a major distinction between those of royal and those of commoner birth " ( Munson et al . 1963:61 ) . Royalty dominates government , and most of its members seek government employment , though some go into the clergy or the military . I lie distinction between royalty and commoner is officially rccognizrd in the Cambodian civil service . Royalty makes up a considerable  | portion of the elite . As of the early 196os , male descendants of King Ang Duong ( r. 1847 ? 1859 ) comprised the category from which monarchs could be chosen ; they numbered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) note that Buddhism " does not support the ultimate validity of such status differences , and the individual Cambodian is encouraged to believe that through the achievement of merit any man can become a Buddha , but the fact of superior and inferior social rank is accepted by most Cambodians as one of the primary reference points for social relationships . " The rural population ? the great mass of the people ? is more interested in betterment in the hereafter , and " competition for status at present involves values foreign to Cambodia 's traditional life " ( Munson et al . 1963:69-70 ) . Although education and wealth accounted for some mobility in recent times , the only significant traditional route for social mobility for the commoner of humble origins was in the monastic order ( Munson et al . 1963 ) . But , of course , a celibate and ascetic order provides only a limited sort of social mobility . All things considered , then , Cambodia was a closed society for many centuries , and one in which ancient patterns of Hindutype caste or varna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is marked by what Wyatt calls " an extraordinarily rich chronicle tradition , " and the " Buddhist historiography of northern Siam is extraordinarily rich " too ( 1976:108 , 114 ) . It is not clear whether these are strictly quantitative statements or whether a positive qualitative judgment is being rendered too . In either case , the limits in time and place with which Wyatt qualifies his statements make them less-than-clear endorsements of the soundness of Thai historiography . He says that some of the earliest ones are far from easy to work with , due to " disparate points of view . . . and severe problems of dating and chronology " ( 1976:109 ) . Elsewhere he comments on " strong indigenous historical traditions in the form of oral legend and written chronicles , some of very considerable antiquity " in the south of Thailand . But he also says of these chronicles that " their blending of myth , literature , and history demands of those who would use them high critical skills . Their chronology is often confused . Their very words are often obscure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment being rendered is not clear . According to Vickcry ( 1979:150 ) only the Luang Praaott chronicles of  | Ayudhya ( a former Thai capital ) , composed in the late 1600s , showed a concern for factual history , " a concern which does not appear in Siam again until the nineteenth century . " Charnvit Kasetsiri 1979 adds that the Luang Prasoet chronicle was written by a royal astrologer in Thai ; usually the authors are monks who write in Pali , the language of the Buddhist canon . Vickery ( 1979 ) suggests that the Luang Prasoet chronicle must have been written under foreign influence , either European or Chinese . Vickery 's judgment is thus largely negative . Chandler 1979 notes that history was more honored and popular in Thailand than in Cambodia . In addition to the Buddhist " universal histories " ( Wyatt 1976 ) , there were two main types of chronicle in Thailand . Tamnan are the earlier forms . Their authors are sometimes , but not normally , known . They are associated with particular localities and principalities of northern Siam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Buddhist embellishments ( Wyatt 1976 ) . Phongsawadan chronicles deal with dynastic history and are secular . " Rather than being written by Buddhist monks , they were written by scribes or officials at the royal court " ( Wyatt 1976:118 ) . The date of the first Ayudhyan chronicle is not known , " although it is quite certain that the basic sources for early texts must have been kept from an early time in the form of astrologers ' notebooks of extraordinary events " ( Wyatt 1976:118 ? 19 ) . Phongsawadan chronicles appear to have been produced for the edification of the rulers and may have been part of their regalia . They were primarily concerned with king and court , and more with war than with peace ( Wyatt 1976 ) . Reynolds 1979 describes a chronicle written in 1789 , apparently phongsawadan , that was atypical in some ways . It has a religious theme and was written by a monk . Patterned on the Sri Lankan Mahavamsa , it showed that the unity of the state depended on a unified monkhood ( sangha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of legitimating a reign ( Reynolds 1979 ) . Social mobility in Thailand is as difficult to assess as Thai historiography . In the early Bangkok period ( 1782 ? 1873 ) Thai society consisted of four major statuses : the descendants of kings , who were very numerous but who lost their status if separated more than five generations from a monarch ; an aristocracy of nonroyal officeholders ; commoners ; and slaves , a small number of whom were hereditary . Royalty and nonroyal officials constituted a niling class , collectively called nai ( Akin Rabibhadana 1969 ) . There were also court Brahmans , as in Cambodia , but they appear to have been less significant , less organized , and probably less numerous in Thailand ( Wales i9 ; 1 ) . " Although the social system was stratified and ranked , " say Hanks and  | Hanks ( 1964:202 ) , " people moved upward and downward over almost the entire range . Commoners were elevated to privilege through official appointment , and nobles automatically became commoners after five generations of decreasing rank . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commoners become officials ? According to Akin Rabibhadana , " upward mobility from the lower class commoners and slaves to that of the governing class . . . appears to have been extremely difficult " ( 1969:155 ) . The barrier to such mobility was the ritual of thawai tua , wherein potential future officials were introduced to the king , who thereby became their patron . Normally , the laws regulating who could be thus introduced to the king effectively excluded commoners , and " this would seem to make it impossible for a commoner to become an official " ( Akin 1969:155-56 ) . Akin is also of the opinion that the monkhood gave little scope for upward mobility . But downward mobility was common . Upward mobility in unusual times ? during or after wars , for example ? did occur ; and , curiously , Chinese entered the aristocracy of officials with some ease , because of their wealth ( not easily acquired by a Thai commoner ) and because they were not clearly classed as commoners and could pass themselves off as Chinese nobles ( Akin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitive judgment as to whether Thai social stratification was open or closed . It is even more difficult to say whether the soundness of the Luang Prasoet chronicle reflects some period of greater openness in Thai society . But on the basis of the degree to which Brahmans persist in their social systems ? and perhaps in a general estimate of their varying rates of or attitudes toward social mobility ? Cambodia , Thailand , and Burma seem to form a cline : greater closure in Cambodia and more openness in Burma , with Thailand in between . This cline is consistent with the pattern of judgment on their respective historiographies . Malleret ( 1961 ) says that , compared to the Vietnamese , the Laotians ( and the Cambodians ) gave little or no official or scholarly attention to maintaining and cataloging documents , and few documents have survived in Laos . This comparison indicates an inferior quality of historiography among the Laotians , though in only one aspect . To some extent this could reflect the considerably smaller size and duration of the Laotian kingdom compared to the Vietnamese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries , the Tai populace was divided into commoner and noble , but the degree of permeability of the boundary between them is not noted . In the later Laotian kingdom of Luang Prabang , at the time the French established a protectorate over it in the late eighteenth century , there was a definite royalty-nobility of birth . But the writings of modern authorities on Laotian society suggest that the " concept of nobility , except within royal lineages , has probably never been too strictly defined among the Laotian Tai " ( LeBar , Hickey , and Musgrave 1964:218 ) . Given the weak or uncertain character of the judgment passed on Laotian historiography , it is probably not necessary to push further the attempt to judge Laotian social stratification as either open or closed . Nanchao was a state in what is now the south of China . In a discussion of the extent to which China 's historiographic tradition may have spread beyond its borders , Hall noted that in Nanchao , " Chinese traditions of historical writing had apparently failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments imply that at least in some respects Nanchao 's historiography was inferior to that of Burma and even more so to that of China . Hall implies that either very little in the way of historical writing was produced in Nanchao or that it has all disappeared , and this is confirmed by Backus 1981 . Until recently the prevailing view of Western writers was that Nanchao had been a Tai kingdom . If it had been Tai , the widespread hereditary ranking systems among Tai speakers ( LeBar , Hickey , and Musgrave 1964 ) would provide an important clue in reconstructing Nanchao stratification . Various lines of research , however , have shown that there probably never were large numbers of Tai speakers in the Nanchao area and hence that " at most , Nanchao appears to have been ruled by a thin stratum of Tai aristocracy " ( LeBar , Hickey , and Musgrave 1964:187 ) . If there indeed had been a Tai aristocracy in Nanchao , there may also have been a closed stratification system . But more recent research argues that the Tai never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1962 ; for a general review of the literature , sec Mote 1964 and Backus 1981 ) . Linguistic and ethnological research now leads to two important conclusions . One is that Nanchao was greatly influenced by Chinese culture ( see , e.g. , Stott 116 ; and Wiens 1954 ) . Nanchao may thus have borrowed  | ideas about advancement on the basis of merit , and some instances of such advancement are reported . But the various Tai aristocracies of Southeast Asia were also highly sinicized , while limiting advancement to within their stratum . Such data as are available on Nanchao do not show whether advancement was thus limited . The second important conclusion is that the dominant peoples of Nanchao were the Pai and Yi ( Mote 1964 ) , also known as the Lolo and Minchia . These are apparently linguistically related peoples , but they are not Tai speakers . The Minchia live in the area of ancient Nanchao and are considerably sinicized . Stratification among them is largely a matter of wealth , especially as reflected in landownership ( LeBar , Hickey , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nanchao , their present-day institutions do not suggest that they were once hereditarily stratified . The Lolo are quite different : " Here was a blood-proud caste of nobility ... who fought , rode , herded horses , and ruled a stratum of underlings and slaves " ( Wiens 1954:94 ) . The " stratification of classic Lolo society was into two endogamous castes ? an aristocratic landowning elite , the Black Bones , and their serfs , the White Bones " ( LeBar , Hickey , and Musgrave 1964:19 ) . Three genealogies collected from Lolo chieftains in the nineteenth century trace their lines back to the rulers of Nanchao . Two of the genealogies give a sequence of two rulers whose names are surprisingly similar to the names independently recorded by the Chinese during Nanchao 's period of greatness ( Blackmore 196o ) . In sum , a case could be made for a system of hereditary ranking in Nanchao , but the data are few and sometimes confused . Given the inadequacy of the materials and the apparently contradictory indications of Minchia and Lolo stratification , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cases just discussed fall into four categories . First , the Bruneis , Malays , Acehnese , and Balinese all had relatively unsound historiographies and closed societies . Second , the Makassarese/Bugis , Vietnamese , and Burmese had relatively sound historiographies and more open societies . Third is a category of ambiguous cases . Of these , the Cambodians could perhaps he safely moved to the first category , but the Thai , Laotians , and people of old Nanchao are genuinely difficult to assess . Fourth is the complex case  | of Java , which in its Hindu phase belongs to the third category , but in its Muslim and European periods appear to fall , respectively , into the second and first categories . Since the cases in the third category proved unrewarding ? and have been included only to provide an analysis sufficiently exhaustive to eliminate bias in selecting cases ? they will not be discussed further . Excluding them has no bearing upon acceptance or rejection of the main hypothesis . Although in this chapter I analyzed every case from a universe of cases that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmation of the hypothesis that the quality of historiography varies directly with the openness of social stratification , the inferences drawn from the results just presented must be made with some care . Various considerations prevent , for example , the direct applicability of a chi-square test . One is that the individual cases are not necessarily independent of each other . It could well be argued that the Brunei case should be subsumed under the Malay case . Even the Acehnese case is not entirely independent of Malay influence . Alternatively , it could be argued , less reasonably , that each Malay state should be an independent case . Another consideration is that one case , the Javanese , ended up as three cases , a treatment not accorded to other cases ( because it did not seem warranted elsewhere ) . However , if we set considerations such as these aside , the odds against the cases falling into the confirmatory pattern in which I have found them are greater than one hundred to one , even if the Javanese case is excluded . With the Muslim and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the odds rise sharply . Certainly it can be said that the Southeast Asian cases tend rather strongly to support rather than disconfirm the hypothesis . No other chapter attempts , as this one has , to assess all relevant cases in the regions and periods they cover , but I see no reason to think that if all relevant cases were assessed , the results ? in terms of the proportions of confirmatory , disconfirmatory , and ambiguous cases ? would be much different from those in this chapter . Generally speaking , the Southeast Asian cases throw little light on the other concomitants of variation in the pattern of social stratification . Nowhere in Southeast Asia was there realistic portraiture or much in the way of natural or social science . Insofar as traces of political science were found ? among the Burmese and Vietnamese , and in the writings of the Rugis-Malay Raja All Haji ? they were found in the expected settings . So too with biography , which was found as a distinct traditional genre only among the Vietnamese and which was introduced to the Malays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malay . In this context it is of interest to note that " the first prominent Indonesian to write something like an autobiography " was a Javanese whose father under the Dutch " rose to the rank of wedana , then the highest bureaucratic rank normally open to Javanese not born to aristocratic bupati families " ( Anderson 1979:223 ) . Individualism was muted among the Bruneis , Malays , and Balinese . But a developed individualism is nowhere well documented among literate peoples in Southeast Asia , though the diaries of the Makassarese/Bugis suggest a greater individualism among them . The Bruneis , the Balinese , and probably the Malays did not possess a uniform conception of human nature ; the Burmese most certainly did . So , too , the Burmese system of monastic education was probably the best case of a uniform system of education . The humanistic-secular attitude was to some extent apparent among the Makassarese/Bugis , and the writings of Raja Ali Haji , the Bugis-Malay , also showed a degree of humanism . However spotty , all these findings are in the right direction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1906 ) reports at length on Acehnese divination , but he provides no comparative perspective . Pigeaud ( 1928 1977:65 ) says that " many Javanese let their lives be governed entirely or partially by the results of divination , even in the present day . " It is not clear what this implies for the past , but Pigeaud ( 1928 1977 ) does imply a limited variety of divinatory techniques ( mostly numerological ) among the pre-Muslim Javanese . A fair selection of divinatory techniques are reported for Malays ( Skeat 1900 1967 ; Winstedt 1951 ) , but little is said about the context or frequency of Malay divination . My own impression is that the Bruneis , while concerned to determine lucky and unlucky days , put relatively little time and effort into divination when compared to their neighbors the Overseas Chinese , but it may be that Chinese techniques are simply more publicly visible . Both this concomitant and the others deserve more careful , comparative study in Southeast Asia . To a lesser extent the same can be said for the region 's systems of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to separate analytically the influence of borrowing ? which has obvious attractions as an explanatory framework in explaining Southeast Asian historiographic traditions ? from the conditions that motivate authors to use what they can borrow . The findings of this chapter provide good evidence that social stratification deserves to he taken into account in assessing such motives .  | To widen my sample beyond Asian historiographies , I examined the two remaining historiographic traditions that have at times influenced the historiography of Southeast Asia ? the European and Near Eastern . General summaries of historiographical development ( Barnes 1937 ; Dentan 1955 ; Echl 19 ( 4 ; Shotwell 1923 ; and Thompson 1942 ) produced a number of contrasts in antiquity . While there is considerable disagreement over the relative soundness of Hebrew , Assyrian , and Babylonian historiography , there is substantial agreement that the Egyptians , and more certainly the later Egyptians , were not historically minded . Some authorities argue that they contrasted in this respect with the Assyro-Babylonians and the Hebrews . Greek historiography developed somewhat later ? possibly independently , possibly stimulated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement on the quality of Greek historical writing , its development was far from uniform , as the Spartans were not historians . Nor , for that matter had the early Greeks ? as opposed to the classical Greeks ? been historically minded . The Romans , too , produced sound historians , but in the later years of the western empire , the quality of Roman historiography declined , setting the stage for the historiography of the Middle Ages .  | Egypt constantly changed , but the changes were ignored ( Wilson 1951 ) . The ancient Egyptians " had very little sense of history " ; they saw the world as " essentially static and unchanging " ; historical events were " superficial disturbances of the established order " ( Frankfort 1951:20 ? 21 ; see also Frankfort 1948 1961 , and Bull 1955 ) . " There is something medieval in the attitude of later Egypt toward its own past , a sense of dimness , a failure to grasp reality " ( Shotwell 1923:53 ) . " The Egyptians were never much of a historywriting people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Thompson 1942:I , 7 ) . If any substantial Egyptian history was written at any time during the dynastic period ( c. 3100 ? 663 B.C. ) , it has not survived ( Barnes 1937 ; Bull 1955 ) . The ahistorical attitude of the Egyptians " is all the more striking when one considers that ... an Egyptian historian ? if there had been one ? had available their enormous mass of archive material " ( Thompson 1942:I , 8 ) . The Egyptians maintained their enormous corpus of records over a very long period , for a variety of purposes and in a variety of places . In the third century B.C. when Manetho , under Greek influence , did write an Egyptian history , he drew on the archives rather than on inscriptions ( Thompson 1942:I ) . According to Bull ( 1955:3 ) , " There is no ancient Egyptian word .. . which closely corresponds to the English word history , ... nor is there any Egyptian text . . . which can be said to express an idea of history ' held by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have an " idea of history , " " in any sense resembling what the phrase means to thinkers of the present age or perhaps of the last 2,400 years " ( Bull 1955:32 ) . On the other hand , the Egyptians did possess a word , often translated as annals , which apparently referred to " historical records as physical documents " ( Bull 1955:3 ) . Thus the Egyptians possessed some of the materials required for writing history but did not write histories . Among these materials were king lists that stretched over enormous periods of time ( Bull 1955 ) . After the First Dynasty of the Old Kingdom ( c. 2700-c. 2200 B.C. ) king lists were supplemented with events of importance for each year of a king 's reign ( Bull 1955 ; Frankfort 1951 ; Wilson 1951 ) . The Egyptians were also keen on genealogies , some of which " cover many generations and involve periods ranging from 300 to 750 years " ( Bull 19c5:9 ) . Portions of the genealogies are demonstrably inaccurate , but some portions arc  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most outstanding genealogy is an inscription listing Memphite priests over no less than 1,350 years . Bull ( 1955:10 ) says that the " general correctness " of the genealogy is supported by other dated sources . Egyptian kings erected monuments or notices of their victories , assuring a kind of historical record of their achievements and showing that they were at least " conscious that they were making history , and that they wished the story to last forever " ( Bull 1955:16 ) . Thompson ( 1942:I ) considered these notices considerably less useful historically than their Assyrian and Babylonian counterparts . Frankfort ( 1948 1961:46 ) agrees with Thompson , saying that the " Egyptian monuments and texts ... consistently hide the individuality of the kings under generalities . " Things , such as portrait heads , that were once thought to show individuality , have been found to be conventional for the period . Frankfort observed that " even in the accounts of royal achievements which we should classify as historical texts , we find , to our exasperation , that everything that is singular and historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . He gives examples , stretching over a very long period of time , of inscriptions that claim for one ruler the actions of a predecessor , even when the deeds of the ruler being memorialized would have been illustrious enough . Although personalities emerge only to a small extent in these dry records , there was an attempt to perpetuate in Egyptian tombs " the name , titles , and deeds of the deceased , whether he were king or commoner . In these inscriptions we have autobiographical data which showed the appreciation of the people for private as well as public history " ( Bull 1955:18 ) . Thus the Egyptians " knew their history " in the sense that they " remembered the great figures of the past " ( Bull 1955:19 ) , and it was not merely kings who were remembered , but other great personages too ( Bull 1955 ) . Bull ( 1955 ) also cites as further evidence of their love of the past the Egyptian tendency to copy ancient architectural and artistic styles . Of course the Egyptians had a considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history ( Bull 1955 ) . " Egyptians may have done little with history , " says Shotwell ( 1923:54 ) , " but they treasured myth and legend . " Frankfort ( 1948 1961:50 ) noted that creation stories were more important in Egyptian thought than in that of their neighbors , for in a " static world , creation is the only event that really matters supremely , since it alone can he said to have made a change . " One final point is that in his generalized account of the origins of civilization in the Near East , Frankfort ( 1951 ) noted that written documents  | were rarer from Egypt than from Mesopotamia . This may indicate less historical-mindedness in Egypt , but it may also reflect differing rates of preservation of texts in the two areas ( to be discussed further below ) . Since it stretches from approximately 3100 B.C. Up to the Persian conquest in 525 B.C. , few generalizations about Egyptian dynastic history seem safe . We do know that from the very earliest times social mobility occurred , though hereditary transmission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are partially reconciled by the apparent predominance of openness in the earlier periods and of closure in the later . Frankfort concluded that " there were no castes , and men of simple origin might rise to the highest posts . . . . The talented and industrious were not frustrated by a rigid class distinction or by a colour bar " ( 1951:90 ) . He goes on to give examples of upward mobility , one from the Sixth Dynasty ( c. 2350 ? 2200 B.C. ) , one involving a Nubian , and one involving a dwarf who ultimately married a woman of the class of " royal kinsmen " ( 1951:92 ; Frankfort 1961 ; see also Maspero 1894 1968 ) . Frankfort ( 1948 1961 ) also says that cases of social mobility may be found in all periods of Egyptian history . This does not , however , deny that it may have been more common in one period than another . Theoretically , the key to social mobility was the authority of the pharaoh to appoint or demote whomever he wished . In practice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereditary succession to priestly and other offices , but his theoretical right was apparently never publically denied ( Frankfort 1951 ) . Correspondingly , we find such things as individuals expressing satisfaction at having risen in rank " through personal merit " ( Frankfort 1951:89 ) ; a king during the first period of dynastic breakdown ( c. 2200 ? 2050 B.C. ) urging his son to promote the worthy regardless of their condition ( Wilson 1951 ) ; a territorial ruler ( nomarch ) , also during the first period of dynastic breakdown , saying that he took men and serfs from other districts ( nomes ) and made them " rank as notables " ( Frankfort 195194 ) ; and a father advising his son " to get ahead in the world " ( Wilson 1951:92 ) . But there were contrary tendencies too . In early times the kings appointed their sons and other close relatives to high positions and more distant kinsmen to lower offices ; when the first vizier was created , in the Fourth Dynasty , he was a " prince of the royal blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Old Kingdom ( i.e. , by 2200 B.C. ) the nomarchs normally transmitted their positions to their sons and thus became a sort of " landed gentry " ( Frankfort 1951:86 ) . In spite of theory , it was already the practice in the Old Kingdom for sons usually to follow their fathers in office ( Frankfort 1951 ) . The first period of dynastic breakdown , which marks the transition between the Old and Middle kingdoms , was apparently the period in which egalitarianism reached its zenith in Egypt . Wilson ( 1951:121 , 14-2 ) calls it a period of " social equality , " a " democratic age , " and a time when commoners bragged of their repute . Wilson cites a text from the period in which the creator god says that he made all men equal in opportunity . He also cites a very popular story in which the king is amused by the eloquence of a common peasant demanding his rights . But egalitarianism was swept away in the second period of dynastic breakdown ( c. 1800 ? 1550 B.c . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dynasty ( c. 1550 ? 1375 B.C. ) , according to Wilson ( 1951:186 ) , " class cleavage " had become marked , and it was rare " to move upward in the social scale . " The power of the priesthood of Amon was especially notable , but during the reign of Akh-en-Aton ( 1369 ? 1353 B.C. ) it was sharply curbed . The final element in Akh-en-Aton 's name signified his allegiance to the god Aton rather than Amon and hence his patronage of a new priesthood . In Akh-en-Aton 's entourage came a " swarm of parvenus , " and the old " hereditary aristocracy " of bureaucracy and priesthood were eclipsed ( Wilson 1951:207 ) . But the setback of hereditary stratification was brief ; under Tut-ankh-Aton ( 1352 ? 1344 B.C. ) the old priesthood of Amon and the hereditary bureaucrats pushed out the parvenus , and the king changed his name to Tut-ankh-Amon ( Wilson 1951 ) . On the whole , the tendency to inherit rank was strong throughout the empire period ( c. 1465 ? 1165 B.C. ) . Before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the high priests of Amon , the high priest then being depicted in art on the same scale as the pharaoh ( Wilson 1951 ) . As Wilson ( 1951:308 ) puts it , after about ' too B.C. Egypt began to " petrify . " " The formation of society into rigid classes , with priests and warriors constituting castes of special privilege , ... unknown in Egypt before the late Empire . . . became more and more important from that time on " ( Wilson 1951:306 ( 17 ) . Maspero 's lengthy summary of the ancient Egyptian " political constitution " ( 1894 1968:245 ? 344 ) ) , provides further insights into Egyptian social stratification . At the top were the pharaohs , descendants of the sun  | god . Their " souls as well as bodies " were of " supernatural origin " ( Maspero 1894 1968:259 ) . An extraordinary emphasis was placed on depicting and defining the supernatural character of the pharaohs , but very little was said about " the individual disposition of any king in particular , or of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Old Kingdom only the pharaoh had a ba , a soul , which " was an expression of continued function after death " ( Wilson 1951:86 ) . But as early as the later part of the Old Kingdom , the pharaoh shared some of his divinity with the priesthood ( Wilson 1951 ) . Later other high-ranking persons " assumed the formerly exclusive mortuary prerogatives of the king and became ... gods after death " ( Wilson 1951:86 ) . Whether this fundamental , and at least partially hereditary , distinction was ever extended to include the masses is not clear . Beneath the pharaoh were high officials and " the great feudal lords " ( Maspero 1894 1968:270 ) . Maspero ( 1894 1968 ) describes the case of a man who rose to territorial lordship ? but he was not allowed to pass his status on to his heirs . Maspero thought that such cases were not uncommon but that the ultimate solidification of achieved high status required marriage into the hereditary nobility , which was composed primarily of children of the pharaohs and of the feudal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and military authority in their territorial domains , normally inherited their status ( Maspero 1894 1968 ) . Maspero 's " great feudal lords , " I presume , are equivalent to , or at any rate include , the nomarchs mentioned earlier . At lower levels in the bureaucracy were a host of scribes of varying rank . They , too , usually inherited their status : " in most of the government administrations , we find whole dynasties of scribes on a small scale , whose members inherited the same post for several centuries " ( Maspero 1894 1968:289 ) . Thus not only were the high priests hereditary but so too were the positions of many lesser priestly functionaries , who collectively formed " a sort of sacerdotal nobility " ( Maspero 1894 1968:305 ) . A genealogy of Memphite priests , preserved on a limestone slab , gives the names of sixty men , " each of whom is said to be the son of his predecessor in the list " ( Bull 1955:10 ) . The early Greek traveler and historian Hecataeus reported an even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations ( Bury 1909 ) . Herodotus in The Persian Wars reports the same . The genealogy of Memphite priests , with a time span of c. 2100 to 750 B.C. , can not be taken at face value . The claim made to Hecataeus and Herodotus has even less credibility . But that  |p1I25  later Egyptian priests believed in or even claimed such rigidly hereditary transmission of status is important in itself . The priests and their subordinates formed a society " distinct from . . . the civil population , and freed from most of the burdens which weighed so heavily on the latter " ( Maspero 1894 1968:305 ) . The army , about which details are obscure , appears to have been somewhat less privileged than the priesthood and was not ordinarily a hereditary occupation , though at times it tended to develop into a sort of nobility . Herodotus described the Egyptian warriors in his time as hereditary , and Wilson ( 1951 ) seems to agree . Together with the priesthood , the army formed the source of power with which the pharaoh and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1894 1968 ) . The lot of the artisan and the peasant was a hard one , and the requirement that everyone must have a master who would represent him in law and who would be the principal beneficiary of any extra effort expended , robbed the people of an incentive to improve their condition . Although the artisans were more organized than the peasants , and perhaps less subject to corvee labor , neither possessed much scope for vertical mobility ( Maspero 1894 1968 ) . Slaves counted for little and after a few generations probably merged with the general population into a serflike condition Quite certainly the line of pharaohs was seen as a race apart , but whether a nobility was thus distinguished from the masses is unclear . Some light may be shed on the matter by Egyptian art , famous for its preoccupation with animals and man-animal hybrids ( Frankfort 1961 ; Wilson 1951 ) . The Egyptians believed that the gods were manifest in animals ( Frankfort 1961 ) , which makes hybrid forms an expectable mode of expressing the interpenetration of divinity and humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egyptian interest in animals , whose species they depicted with considerable accuracy , stemmed from the immutability of species ( unlike humanity , in which " individual characteristics seem to outbalance generic resemblances " ) . Animals appealed to the Egyptians , according to this reasoning , because they more clearly manifested the static nature of the universe . If I may extend Frankfort 's speculation , it is possible that the Egyptian preoccupation with animal and hybrid forms was an attempt to link the immutability of species differences with the nature of stratification , to  | equate social divisions with speciation . Analogues of this notion , which connects art with caste or castelike social orders , are , I suspect , found in India and medieval Europe , and will be discussed later . As noted in the discussion of Egyptian historiography , Frankfort ( 1961 ) asserts that individualism was not characteristic of the Egyptians . Wilson ( 1951 ) disagrees in that he finds considerable individualism in earlier periods , though little in later times . Wilson ( 1951 ) says that conformity to the local group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egyptians , and that there was considerable individualism as late as the Middle Kingdom ( c. 2050 ? 1800 B.C. ) . But after the period of Hyksos rule ( c. 1730 ? 1570 B.C. ) , individualism was repressed ( Wilson 1951 ) . This , Wilson says , was accompanied by an increasing separation between the high and the low , and an emphasis on resignation : " Theology then advised . . . the masses that this was their predestined fate and that they must submit to it with quietude , in the hope of a reward in paradise " ( 1951:298 ) . The Empire ( c. 1465 ? 1165 B.C. ) , and especially the Late Empire and Post Empire ( c. 1150 ? 663 B.C. ) , " could not tolerate . . . individualism " ( Wilson 1951:302 ) . If Wilson 's assessments are correct , individualism and social stratification co-vary in the expected pattern . While biography as a literary genre may have been absent , Egyptian funerary practice did give outlet , apparently throughout the entire dynastic period , to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see also Misch 1950 ) . In addition , portraits labeled with the name of their subject were found in all periods of Egyptian history . However , these portraits were rarely if ever true portraits . In his comparative and historical study of ancient portraiture , Breckenridge ( 1968 ) discusses Egyptian portraits at considerable length . He says that probably no Egyptian portrait , before the conquest by Alexander in 332 B.C. , is an actual likeness of the person it allegedly portrays . On the other hand , Egyptian sculptors were technically capable of producing actual likenesses , and at various times produced heads of markedly natural or realistic appearance . These apparently realistic portrait heads are at all times rare , and two characteristics cast doubt on their authenticity as portraits : either the various portraits of the same subject do not resemble each other , or the same physiognomy is imposed on more subjects than are likely to have shared a family likeness . In the former case each portrait may be unique , but it is not demonstrably a likeness of the alleged subject ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lust a natural-looking iron . In some cases , highly realistic masks were used as the armature upon which  | an idealized portrait was built up ; where these masks have survived , they give , according to Breckenridge , a false impression of realistic portraiture . Breckenridge ( 1968:44 ) says that " taken as a group , the portraits of the Old Kingdom are the most individualized and naturalistic of any major period of Egyptian history , " which fits nicely with the apparent tendency of Egyptian social stratification to start out open and end up closed . A resurgence of naturalism in the Amarna period , ushered in by Akh-enAton and his entourage of parvenus , is also consistent ( Breckenridge 1968 ; Wilson 1951 ) . Wilson ( 1951 ) found naturalism up to the end of the Empire , that is , up to the point where he began to see Egypt petrify . After the Greek conquest of Egypt , true portraits were produced there , but they remained rare ( Breckenridge 1968 ) . Wilson ( 1951:9 ) says that " Egyptian literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a father to his son , " which hints at hereditary transmission of status . But in the Empire period , instruction in the scribal school became more common ( Wilson 1951 ) . No firm conclusion about patterns of education can be drawn from these observations . Wilson also asserts that " there was no written and detailed statecraft for Egypt " ( 1951:72 ) , nor do I see any signs of social science . For a short time in the earliest dynasties a " scientific spirit " prevailed in Egypt , especially in medicine ( Wilson 1951155 ) . But after this good start , science and technology ceased to develop , and no later period came up to the early standard ( Wilson 1951 ) . Wilson mentions an oracular function of the pharaoh , as well as scribes " who could foretell what was to come " ( 1951:262 ) . Herodotus also mentions Egyptian oracles . But Speiser ( 1955:62 ) says of the pharaoh that " a god incarnate does not take his cue from the liver of a sheep . " Egyptian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Leclant ( 1968 ) attributes to their religious notion that the future could only repeat the past . But Leclant 's explanation is almost certainly wrong , since the possibility that the future may repeat the past is precisely the reason often given for the utility of divination . One thing certain is that a lesser development of divination in Egypt can not be attributed to a lesser religiosity or superstitiousness . Herodotus depicted the Egyptians as " religious to excess , far beyond any other race of men " ( 5th c . B. C. 1942:II , 37 ) . He described some of their ritual practices , noting that the priests observed " thousands " more ( hut not at the cost of enjoying material advantages ) . Wilson ( 1951:306 ? 07 ) agrees and  | makes the additional comment that the stress on ceremony and magic was greater in the later periods of Egyptian history . From the foregoing it seems safe to say that Egypt ended up as a castelike society , though it did not begin that way . Many of the concomitants conform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , why did good historiography not develop then ? Perhaps the correct answer is that Egyptian historiography actually was better in the earlier periods . Recall that Shotwell ( 1923:53 ) said that " there is something medieval in the attitude of later Egypt toward its own past " ( my italics ) . When we also recall that annals ( however rudimentary ) and rather detailed biographical information survive from the third millennium B.C. , perhaps we can say that that was not , after all , such a bad start on the development of historiography . In this context we might note that the three texts that Barnes 1937 gives as examples of minor exceptions to the rule that Egyptians did not produce histories all date from before the period in which Wilson sees caste developing in Egypt ; the latest , the Turin papyrus , dates from the thirteenth century B.C. or earlier ( Dentan 1955 ) . We might further note that Frankfort ( 1951:50 ) describes the earliest art of Mesopotamia as mostly religious , while the earliest works of Eygptian art " celebrate royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of comparatively great historical-mindedness in the earliest times . If Egyptian stratification had remained open , we would perhaps expect improvements in historiography . Because it did not remain open , either the maintenance of archaic standards or the actual decline of standards suggested by Shotwell are predictable historiographic responses . Sayce ( 1900:58 ) is among those who lump the Hebrews , Babylonians , and Assyrians together in contrast with the Egyptians : " Like the Hebrews , " he wrote , " the Assyrians were distinguished by a keen historical sense which stands in curious contrast to the want of it which characterized the Egyptian . The Babylonians also were distinguished by the same quality , though perhaps to a less extent than their Assyrian neighbors . " Dannenfeldt 1954a , Speiser 1955 , and Thompson 1942:I essentially agree . Since if the Babylonians and Assyrians did write history , they may have written it earlier than the Hebrews , I will examine the former two first .  | Thompson ( 1942:I , II ) credits the Assyrians with being " the first people who created a genuine historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on buildings , which in time gave way to annals of a king 's reign . Misch ( 1950 ) argues that Assyrian historiography had roots in kingly biography , which in time became political autobiography , sometimes sensitively personalistic . Developments in Assyria may have been based on prior developments in Babylonia , which in most respects is treated as roughly parallel to Assyria in basic cultural features . Thus Thompson ( 1942:I , 10 ) quotes Olmstead ( 1916 ) as follows : " The historical writings of the Assyrians form one of the most important branches of their literature . Indeed , it may be claimed with much truth that it is the most characteristically Assyrian of them all . The Assyrians derived their historical writing , as they did so many other cultural elements , from the Babylonians . " For many purposes the two may be treated together under the heading of Mesopotamian society ( Speiser 1955 ) . Oppenheim ( 1964 ) , who attempts to portray Mesopotamian civilization in its own terms , demurs to some extent in the evaluation of its historiography . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be histories are proportionately few and generally late . While many aspects of Mesopotamian historical writings were less than sound ? the destruction of predecessors ' annals , claiming predecessors ' deeds for oneself , and grossly exaggerating one 's own feats , for example ? some portions of the literature are largely free of such distortions ( Oppenheim 1964 ; Thompson 194-2:I ) . According to Thompson , a highpoint was reached in the Babylonian Chronicle , of the New Babylonian Empire , which provides contemporary history for almost a century , ending in the seventh century B.C. ( 1942:I ; see also Contenau 1954 ) . Speiser ( 1955:67 ) seems to agree and quotes Olmstead 's ( 1916:62 ) commendation of the chronicle 's " sobriety of presentation and . . . coldly impartial statement of fact . " The ancient Mesopotamians , like the Egyptians , also lacked a word that corresponds to our word history , yet they had some idea of history , for they were very much aware of the past , were " forever busy recording its details , " and were " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Speiser 1955:38 ) . Oppenheim ( 1964:233 ) also sees practical reasons behind the earliest annals and lists . It is this attempt to draw lessons from the past that gives Mesopotamian historical writing a peculiar stamp , diticrcntiates it from the Egyptian interest in the past , and aligns the Mesopotamians with the truly historically minded peoples .  | Finkelstein ( 1963 ) incisively addresses the peculiarity of Mesopotamian historiography and the question of whether it produced history . He concedes that many common conceptions of history , shaped by Western experience , could not easily accommodate the Mesopotamian treatment of the past . But if we accept Huizinga 's concept of history as " the intellectual form in which a civilization renders account to itself of its past " ( 1963:9 ) , then the Mesopotamians did have history ( Finkelstein 1963 ) . Finkelstein , I might add , understands the terms " intellectual form " and " account .. . of its past " in such a way as to preclude myth ( 1963:469 ? 70 and n. 35 ) . The Mesopotamian genre that Finkelstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept is composed of " omen texts , " which have long been considered as somehow closely connected to Mesopotamian historiography . The omen texts were key elements in Mesopotamian divination , which in turn " was rooted in , and is most characteristic of , the fundamental cognitive mode of the Mesopotamian intellect " ( Finkelstein 1963:463 ; see also Oppenheim 1964 and Speiser 1955 ) . In Mesopotamian thought , man was not the center of the universe ; an autonomous study of man would have made little sense . " To the Mesopotamian the crucial and urgent subject of study was the entire objective universe . . . . There probably has never been another civilization so singlemindedly bent on the accumulation of information , and on eschewing any generalization or enunciation of principles .... Njo phenomenon was too trivial to record " ( Finkelstein 1963 : 463 ) . It was not merely things that the Mesopotamians were interested in but , more important , occurrences : " A moment of time was apprehended and defined as the sum total of the occurrences and events known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just as things repeat themselves in space , the Mesopotamians held that events co-occur and recur in time . Hence , in order to ensure their well-being , the Mesopotamians collected information on conjoined occurrences so that these could be used to predict human events . If a particular human event , such as a victory in war , had been conjoined with certain natural events and/or with particular results of artificial divinatory procedures , then those natural events and/ or divinatory results were omens of victory in war . The objective and consistent collection of tables of co-occurring events ? even though its purpose be omenry ? is much like the keeping of ordinary historical records . The omen materials collected by the Mesopotamians " lie at the very root of all Mesopotamian historiography " ; moreover , " as a historical genre they take precedence both in time and in reliability over any other genre of Mesopotamian writing that purports to treat of the events of the past " ( Finkelstein Texts concerning divination are the commonest  | element in Mesopotamian literature , and references to divination in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Mesopotamians were fundamentally empirical scientists , agreeing that " the best insurance for coping with the future is the most reliable and accurate knowledge of the experience of the past " ( Finkelstein 1963:463 ) . Oppenheim ( 1964 ) seems to agree , often referring to Mesopotamian divination as a " science " ( see also Contenau 1954 ) . The one failure of the Mesopotamians ? and of course it was a fundamental one ? was vastly to exaggerate the interconnectedness of phenomena and hence to fail to distinguish accidental co-occurrences from those that are causally connected . Omenry was an official function as early as 2500 B.C. in Sumer , but the period in which omen history was most developed was that of the Akkad dynasty ( c. 2350 ? 2200 B.C. ) . The co-occurrences collected for this period became the standard for divination and unfortunately were not much supplemented in later periods ( Finkelstein 1963 ; Oppenheim 1964 ) . Much later , when the Mesopotamian chronicles developed , they relied on the omen literature for information on the Akkadian period . Finkelstein ( 1963:469 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past ? other than the omens and chronicles ? to be real history , primarily because they were not motivated by " the desire to know what really happened " as Mesopotamians understood this problem . Speiser ( 1955 ) gives a concise summary of the other forms of Mesopotamian historical materials which , if they were not written to be history , are nonetheless useful to present-day historians . His concluding evaluation of the Mesopotamian contribution is that it marked " a significant early milestone ; a milestone in the progress of the idea of history as well as of the history of ideas " ( 1955:73 ) . Finkelstein ( 1963 ) correctly draws attention to the analogy with China , whose historiography also grew out of omenry ; equally appropriately he quotes Thucydides on the applicability of past events to predicting the future . It may be noted in passing that most of what we know of Mesopotamian omenry was almost exclusively connected with the affairs of kings , whose fate represented the fate of society ( Finkelstein 1963 ) . But omenry was used by commoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As for the Hebrews , Thompson ( 1942:I ) notes a similarity between the Babylonian and Assyrian historical records and Kings and Chronicles in the Old Testament . Thompson considers the Old Testament to he primarily historical , with seventeen of its books manitcstly so . In their present forms they were written very much later than the Mesopotamian chronicles . Oral  | traditions , however , no doubt go back to the time of David , ( c. 1000 B.C. ) . The quality varies considerably ( Thompson 1942:I ) . Although the Hebrew texts are less detailed than those of Babylonia , Dannenfeldt ( 1954a ) thinks the former were more unified , presented more personalities , and gave a larger role to the individual . Oppenheim ( 1964:153 ) considers the " realism " of the account of David in the books of Samuel to be greater than in any Mesopotamian text . For Barnes ( 1937:19 , 22 ) , who is not willing to concede that " truly historical narrative of considerable scope and high relative veracity " was found among Mesopotamians , the Hebrew narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which any record has anywhere been preserved . " One of the outstanding peculiarities of Hebrew history is its lack of inscriptions ; the literary texts are all we have ( Burrows 1955 ) . They combine a variety of possible sources , and many portions have probably been rewritten through time . As with other ancient histories , authorship is obscure , although various portions can be linked to specific unknown authors . When exploring the various primarily religious ideas of the past that inform the Old Testament , Burrows ( 1955 ) finds much that would not pass muster as history . But he does not wish to discount it entirely : A disinterested curiosity as to what actually happened and a desire to preserve an accurate record of events for posterity may have been at work in some of the records consulted and quoted in the historical books , but for the most part these have been preserved only in fragments .... There is one outstanding exception to this rule . The full , frank , objective account of David 's reign in II Sam . 9-20 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyewitness , or at least a contemporary , has been widely recognized as one of the finest examples of historical narrative in any ancient literature . ( Burrows 1955:110 ) Shotwell ( 1923 ) is the least charitable toward the ancients . For lack of the idea of criticism , he says , neither the Egyptians nor the Babylonians wrote history . He implies that the Hebrews did little better , but he refers specifically only to Genesis . The ability to evaluate material about the past critically , and thus to compose sound history , first developed , according to Shotwell ( 1923 ) , among the Greeks . Many historians apparently agree , but that is the topic of a later section in this chapter . According to an older view , some sort of feudal landed nobility existed at an early time in both Babylonia and Assyria , but in Babylonia the nobility  | was early displaced or absorbed by priestly and mercantile classes , leaving behind little trace of itself . By the time of Nebuchadnezzar ( seventh to sixth centuries B.C. ) high status was based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1900 ) . In Assyria the traces of the old feudal nobility were stronger , but the nobility was steadily replaced by royal appointees . Under Tiglath-pileser III ( eighth century B.C. ) the tendency became policy and the nobility disappeared ( Sayce 1900 ) . The current view , based on Jacobsen 's 1943 study of Mesopotamian myths and epics , is that the earliest Mesopotamian ( Sumerian ) communities were egalitarian " primitive democracies . " Since there was no writing in the period to which his analysis refers , Jacobsen 's views can not be proved , but they are now generally accepted ( Frankfort 1951 ; Oppenheim 1964 ; Saggs 1962 ) . The earliest community or city-state officials were not hereditary ( Saggs 1962 ) , and there seems to be a consensus that in principle Babylonian kingship was never hereditary . In Assyria the hereditary principle of kingship probably did develop , but it did not drive out the ideal of the " selfmade " king . Most authorities reject the notion that the Mesopotamian kings were gods , but Oppenheim says that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in office ( Contenau 1954 ; Oppenheim 1964 ; Saggs 1962 ; Sayce 1900 ) . In the Code of Hammurabi ( c. 2100 B.C. ) , which presents a very early picture of Mesopotamian society , only three classes are mentioned : free men , slaves , and a middle class about which almost nothing is known ( Contenau 1954 ) . Oppenheim ( 1964:74 ) says it was a " primary characteristic " of Mesopotamia that , except for kings and slaves , the only form of social stratification was economic . Thus the distinction between free and slave seems to have been the major division in social stratification . The Babylonian and Assyrian conceptions of slavery demonstrate clearly that their societies were open . A slave " could become a free citizen and rise to the highest offices of state . Slavery was no bar to his promotion , nor did it imprint any stigma upon him . . . . Between his habits and level of culture and those of his owners was no marked distinction , no prejudices to be overcome on account of his color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sayce 1900:67 ) . Slaves in both Babylonia and Assyria were of various origins , including previously free men enslaved for debt . In both places , slaves had extensive property rights . They could own businesses and cattle ; they could save money and could bank ; they could own other slaves and could purchase  | their own freedom ; they could become craftsmen ; they could trade with each other and with free men ; they had few disabilities in court ; they could be adopted and unadopted . Intermarriage between slave and free was not uncommon . Slaves were never a majority and were never decisive in the economy ( Contenau 1954 ; Oppenheim 1964 ; Saggs 1962 ; Sayce 1900 ) . There may have been temple serfs in early Babylonia , recruited from prisoners of war . The use of the term serf suggests lesser mobility for this class ( Oppenheim 1964 ; Sayce 1900 ) . Peasants and artisans were held in considerable esteem . Legend held that one of the very early Mesopotamian kings of great prestige , Sargon , had been a gardener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took jobs as secretaries and librarians ( Contenau 1954 ; Sayce 1900 ) . Finally , we may note some of the concomitants . The Babylonian legal code was based on individual responsibility , and people of all classes , from high to low , could be moneylenders ( Sayce 1900 ) . Although nowhere explicitly stated in the works I have consulted , a conception of uniform human nature is implicit in Assyrian and Babylonian notions of slavery and of individual legal responsibility . Oppenheim ( 1964:112 ) notes that ethnicity did not " articulate " the structure of Mesopotamian cities , which also suggests a uniform conception of human nature and its correlated individualism . But none of my sources explicitly describes the Mesopotamians as individualistic , or even discusses their views on human nature . Moreover , little mention is made of biography in Mesopotamia ( but see Misch 1950 ) , and its portraiture showed less individualism or naturalism than Egypt 's ( Breckenridge 1968 ) . Not enough is known about education in Babylonia and Assyria to draw any firm conclusions concerning its relationship to social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is some , but not much , reason to think of the Mesopotamians as humanistic-secular in thought . In Sumerian literature ( cherished in Babylonia and Assyria ) there was a term , nam-lu-lu , which was " exactly the equivalent of the Latin humanitas ... in both of its meanings : ( 1 ) the collectivity of mankind ' and ( z ) the complete blossoming forth of human values , humanism ' " ( Gordon 1960:123 ) . Oppcnheim ( 1964:181 ) says that " religion 's claims on the private individual were extremely limited in Mesopotamia . " And specifically human affairs were a concern in divination . On the other hand , Contenau ( 1954:302 ) notes that the Mesopotamians showed little interest in the human form in art and says that they were " enslaved " by ritual . It is also difficult to sec a substantial beginning of political or social science in Mesopotamia , except  | that its history was generally of political affairs and its divination was concerned with cause and effect in political affairs , and perhaps social affairs too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects treated in Sumerian and Akkadian " wisdom literature " ( known to us primarily from copies made in Babylonia or Assyria ) were " such everyday practical matters as the economy and social behavior " ( for Babylonian examples , including rudimentary political science , see Lambert 1960 ) . But to count these as beginnings of political and social science may stretch the meaning of those terms . In the natural sciences Mesopotamia fares better . Mesopotamian mathematical methods were better than , or comparable to , any others up to the early Renaissance . They grew out of administrative and practical needs but toward the middle of the first millennium B.C. were linked to astronomy , where they became " a vehicle for scientific creativity " ( Oppenheim 1964:306 ? 7 ; Saggs 1962 ) . Astronomy , possibly even preceding astrology , was highly developed ( Saggs 1962 ) . Botanical gardens were created late in the eighth century B.C. ( Contenau 1954 ; Saggs 1962 ) . The Babylonians put considerable effort of a protolinguistic character into etymological studies of Sumerian ( Sayce 1900 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It remains only to note that virtually any phenomenon could be taken as an omen ( Saggs 1962 ) and to suggest that for the Mesopotamians , divination was the queen of the sciences . That it was considered to be a science , and is still often so described , was mentioned above . Its linkage to historical studies was also shown . Given the connection of divination to kingship , it is not unreasonable to suggest that such political science as the Mesopotamians may have developed was no less under the umbrella of divination . A note of caution must be sounded , however , in connection with our knowledge of Mesopotamia . The much greater durability of Mesopotamian portable writing material ? clay , as opposed to the leather and paper of Egypt ? has given us unequal access to information about the two regions . Oppenheim ( 1964:220 ) suggests , therefore , that Egypt " probably " developed as many techniques of divination as did the Mesopotamians , but the Egyptian techniques have not been preserved . In a similar vein , he says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or largely , a consequence of the Mesopotamian technique of training scribes to copy accurately , in conjunction , of course , with the remarkable durability of the texts once they were produced . By implication , the Mesopotamians were not intrinsically interested in history ; for accidental reasons they just  | happened to preserve more of the past than others did . In keeping with this point of view , Oppenheim tends to belittle the historical-mindedness of the Mesopotamians . As mentioned earlier , for example , he notes the lateness and infrequency of historical texts . He also notes , quite correctly , that the Mesopotamians ' interest in the past was more antiquarian than historical . But at the same time he draws attention to signs of historicalmindedness difficult to document for Egypt . He mentions " astronomical diaries " that record on a day-to-day basis various sorts of human events . He notes the annals that cover many of the years from c. 744 to 264 B.C. He says that the " historical preamble " of a treaty between Assyria and Babylonia , covering a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bespeaks a serious interest in history dictated by political exigencies " ( 1964:146 ) . Finally , he notes that there must have been an oral tradition of history too , in which the " deeds , crimes , and victories of famous rulers " were remembered , becoming the source of the later literary stories of early kings ( 1964:151 ) . Thus , although the evidence may be skewed by the better preservation of texts in Mesopotamia than in Egypt , the available evidence does suggest a sounder sense of history in the former area . For my purposes , the Babylonian and Assyrian cases turn out to be virtually indistinguishable , except that historiography and biography developed further in the latter . Both cases meet expectations with regard to historiography and divination , somewhat less so with regard to natural science and individualism . The remaining concomitants are either neutral or contrary to expectation . By themselves the Assyrians and Babylonians did not display the full syndrome connected with open societies . But they did have more of the open-society syndrome than did late Egypt , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been open throughout all , or nearly all , the period they are known to us . The ancient Hebrews do not provide such a clear picture of openness , though their society was considerably more open than that of later Egypt . The descendants of the royal house of David had prestige but no special privileges . Neither the king nor his person was sacred . The kings could appoint whomever they would to high office , which provided considerable scope for social mobility and a counterweight to aristocratic factions ( Baron 1952:I ) . Part of Jewish tradition stressed that the Davidian dynasts were not exalted figures . As Weber notes , " the ancient Israelite leader had been an ass-riding , charismatic prince of the people , without a train of war chariots , treasure , harem , forced labor , taxes , and airs of world leadership "  | ( 1952:184 ) . Kingship and high office , therefore , did little to encourage caste among the Hebrews . The matter was to be , at times , quite different in the priesthood . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and divisions of the priestly caste or castes ? the Kohen or Levi ? but there is little doubt that hereditary priesthood existed among the more ancient Hebrews and was of high status ( Baron 1952:I ) . Weber ( 1952 ) asserted that originally they were oracle takers ( by casting lots ) , and possessed no monopoly . The Levi eventually achieved , or nearly achieved , a monopoly in ritual affairs that was ratified by the kings , though they maintained the right to appoint high priests from among those qualified by birth ( Baron 1952:I ; Weber 1952 ) . For a brief period after the return from Babylon , a more complex set of " genealogical classes " existed ? almost a caste system . It broke down in a few generations , but the Kohen and Levi still remained genealogically separate ( Baron 1952:I , 275 ) . On the other hand , the Hebrews as a whole resented the priestly monopoly , and the proportion the priests represented ? about i to 3 percent of the populace ? was " too insignificant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 272 ) . The priestly class was seriously divided , there was a memory of a time when there was no priestly caste , and this caste was often the target of prophetic denunciation ( Baron 1952:I ; Weber 1952 ) . Whereas at times genealogies were carefully maintained , at other times they were revised to suit the needs of one or another priestly faction ( Baron 1952:I ; Weber 1952 ) . In short , the existence of a priestly caste did not give rise to a system of castes , and although the priests may have shared dominance with the rulers , the priests were not the dominant class . Thus Baron ( 1952:I , 75 ? 76 ) places considerable stress on the legal equality of all Israelites : " In legal theory there were no class distinctions in Israel . . . . Israelitic laws , starting with the Book of the Covenant , recognized no separate estates , no special privileges . All Israelites , with the exception of thegerim ( strangers ) and perhaps the landless proletarians were supposed to enjoy perfect equality before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to priestly descent " did not , according to Jewish law , carry with them any special rights ... . Before the law every born Jew was an Israelite , ' in some respects inferior in rank to a Kohen ' or Levi , ' but absolutely equal to any other Jewish layman " ( Baron 1952:I , 274 ) . This is not clear evidence that the ancient Israelites had a conception of ' a uniform human nature . The doctrine of the " chosen people , " in fact ,  | suggests otherwise ( Baron 1952:I ) . This point will be taken up again in the final chapter , where a distinction is drawn between endo-racism ( which is like caste ) and exo-racism ( which characterizes such conceptions as that of the chosen people ) . But for the time being it may be noted that mass education began in Israel under Ezra in the fourth or fifth century B.C. ( Baron 1952:II ; Encyclopaedia Judaica 1971:VI ) , which is consistent with a uniform conception of human nature within Hebrew society . Concerning other concomitants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but biography was not a separate genre . The Book of Nehemiah is autobiographical , or substantially so ( Encyclopaedia Judaica 1971:IV ; Misch 1950 ) . Many individuals , from many stations in life , stand out in Hebrew history , but many other features of individualism are clearly absent . Hebrew history contains substantial secular and political history ? Nehemiah again provides examples ( Misch 1950 ) ? but secular humanism , as well as political , social , and natural science was inconspicuous among the ancient Hebrews . Divination , by a variety of methods , certainly occurred among the Hebrews , but most forms were condemned by the prophets ( Baron 1952:I ; Encyclopaedia Judaica 1971:IV ; Hastings 1928:IV ) . It does not seem as ubiquitous as in Mesopotamia . Realistic portraiture did not develop ( Encyclopaedia Judaica 1971:III , XIII ) . The ancient Hebrews showed less of the open-society syndrome than did the Mesopotamians . This may reflect some concession to the hereditary principle , as in the case of the priesthood , but it may also reflect the considerably smaller scale of Israeli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Assyria or Babylonia . To summarize social stratification in our societies from the ancient Near East , ancient Israel showed elements of caste but not nearly as much as Egypt , and the Babylonians and Assyrians were even less caste-minded than the Hebrews . Compared to Egypt , and certainly later Egypt , society among the Mesopotamians and Hebrews was open . These findings are basically consistent with the respective historiographies . Within the , antique Greek tradition , two contrasts are of special interest . One is the marked contrast between the early or ancient period of the great epic poems of Homer and Hcsiod , and the later period of such prose  | historians as Herodotus and Thucydides ( Starr 1968 ) . The second contrast is found within the classical period , between the Athenians and the Spartans . J. B. Bury 's views provide an introduction to the first contrast : Long before history , in the proper sense of the word , came to be written , the early Greeks possessed a literature which was equivalent to history for them and was accepted with unreserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only entertained the imagination , but also satisfied what we may call the historical interest . . . . The story of the past made a direct appeal to their pride . . . and was associated with their religious piety towards their ancestors . Every self-respecting city sought to connect itself , through its ancient clans , with the Homeric heroes , and this constituted the highest title to prestige in the Greek world . The poems which could confer such a title were looked up to as authoritative historical documents . ( 1909:2 ) Hesiod belonged to a school of " genealogical poets " whose . . . aim was to work into a consistent system the relationships of the gods and heroes , deriving them from the primeval beings who generated the world , and tracing thereby to the origins of things the pedigrees of the royal families which ruled in the states of Hellas. ( 1909:5 ) Up to the middle or end of the sixth century , then , their epic poetry satisfied the historical interest of the Greeks . For us it is mythical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Awakening of the Greek Historical Spirit ( 1968 ) , Starr sees many features of Greek historical writing foreshadowed in the epic poems . Though not physically described in much detail , the heroes are individualized , their characters emerging to some degree . And although the gods figure in the epics , men , with their human passions , are the center of interest . While elements of human nature were presented in the epics , according to Starr , " one does not sense that deliberate analysis of human nature was a tool anywhere available " ( 1968:18 ) . It was a long step from the epic poems to the historical world , for Homer 's " mental attitude , " says Starr ( 1968:12 ) , was far from that of the historian , and Hesiod was little more historical than Homer . In neither " can we detect a consciously historical attitude " ( Starr 1968:34 ) . While an occasional writer , even in antiquity , may have counted Homer as the father of history ( Pearson 1939 ) , the vast majority agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concurs , describing Homer 's works as " legend " and Hesic xl 's as " myth " ( 1946:18 ) . He identifies the first major step toward scientific history in the fifth century a.1 ; . , giving Herodotus ( c. 484-c. 425 B.C. ) the principal credit . Monligliano 's authoritative essays on Greek historiogra- phy give Herodotus the position of the father of history ( 1966 ; 1978b ) . Starr ( 1968 ) agrees , but Bury ( 1909:12 ) gave credit to a lesser-known figure : " Hecataeus . . . initiated the composition of modern ' history . " Hecataeus ( c. 550 ? 478 B.c. ) was born in a time and among a people ( the Ionian Greeks ) characterized by broad contacts beyond the Greek world , and by a growth of religious skepticism and scientific rationalism ( Momigliano 1966 ; Starr 1968 ) . Hecataeus wrote , among other things , a prose work entitled Genealogies . He began the work with a statement of considerable skepticism toward Greek stories , for which reason , according to Bury , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I write here is the account which I considered to be true . For the stories of the Greeks are numerous , and in my opinion ridiculous " ( quoted in Bury 1909:13 ) . Bury concluded that in " aim and effort he was a pioneer " ( 1909:16 ; see also Momigliano 1977 ) . In an extended discussion of the various Ionian historians , Pearson ( 1939 ) gives a quite different interpretation of the opening lines of Hecataeus 's Genealogies . He says they express his " aristocratic pride , " presumably by belittling the genealogies of others . It is therefore a mistake , he says , to interpret the opening lines as the preface to an " impartial " and " rationalistic " analysis . Starr ( 1968:115 ) also doubts that Hecataeus " can in any serious sense be called a historian , " even if he did have an important influence on Herodotus 's methods . On the other hand , even though he would reduce the contribution of Hecataeus , Pearson argues for the development of historical writing on a rather broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hellanicus of Lesbos wrote in a manner similar in content and style to Herodotus . While they appear to have been his near contemporaries , it is not always clear who may have been copying whom ( Pearson 1939 ) . Thus , although Herodotus may widely enjoy the position of the father of history , he was not entirely without competitors immediately before , during , or very shortly after his time ( see also Starr 1968 ) . Although born in a Dorian city , from which he was subsequently exiled , Herodotus " was educated in Ionian rationalism " and wrote his great history of the Persian Wars while living in Athens ( Starr 1968:120 ) . Herodotus conducted two basic types of research : inquiries into events that had occurred a generation earlier and travels to ask questions about past and present conditions . " Sightseeing and oral tradition " provided his materials ( Momigliano 1966:129 ) . Geography and ethnography were no less a part of his work than was narrative history . He showed much curiosity and  | considerable objectivity in treating non-Greek peoples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notions of cultural relativity and ethnocentrism , and he has often been described as a " barbarophile " ( Momigliano 1966 ; Starr 1968 ) . His ethnographic reports were widely disbelieved , and he was not to shake his reputation as a liar until the sixteenth-century , when travelers provided accounts of customs that made the ones he had described seem believable and when travel and oral tradition were again shown to be effective research methods ( Momigliano 1966 ) . Herodotus wrote to preserve the glory of Greek and barbarian deeds , and the causes of their quarrel . He was concerned more to collect and perpetuate than to criticize existing information . This preservationist attitude was widespread in the early fifth century B.C. Fortunately , his extraordinary curiosity was matched by a no less extraordinary memory , and his contributions to international chronology were important ( Momigliano 1966 , 1978b ; Starr 1968 ) . Perhaps because his style was admired and copied until well into the Byzantine period , Herodotus 's work has survived more than well enough to show that he grasped the essentials of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex chains of events brought about by human action in diverse parts of the world . He made a remarkably successful attempt to ascertain , analyze , and present these events to explain the conditions of his time , and with relatively little political or religious bias . In spite of his lively interest in mythology , he moved the Greek sense of the past " from the zone of myth to that of the recent past " ( Momigliano 1966:212 ; see also 1977 and 1978b , and Starr 1968 ) . It should also be remembered that Herodotean historiography established a precedent for an intimate connection between history , on the one hand , and ethnography , sociology and political science , on the other ( Momigliano 1978b ) . Many authorities would agree that if he was not the first " real " historian among the Greeks , Thucydides ( c. 46o-c. 40o B.C. ) was nonetheless the best of them , the most scientific . Cochrane ( 1929 ) undertook an extensive attempt to show the roots of Thucydides ' scientific approach and to argue that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time . According to Cochrane ( 1929 ) , the atomistic philosophy of Democritus ( c. 460-c. 370 B.C. ) provided conditions appropriate to the scientific study of human behavior . The study of " human nature " was , in fact , one of the principal headings in Democritus 's division of scientific endeavor . Closely related to this was the distinct humanism ? in the sense of an orientation toward human affairs  --  - of fifth century Greek science .  | Protagorus ( c. 481 ? c. 411 B.C. ) said , " Man is the measure of all things , " and according to Cochrane ( 1929:94 ) , Greek humanism was the " first fruit of the Democritean method . " Political science , modestly labeled history , was Thucydides ' contribution to humanistic science ( Cochrane 1929 ) . The immediate model for Thucydides was not physics and mathematics but the biology and medical science incorporated by Hippocrates ( c. 4-61 ) ? 357 B.C. ) in his Ancient Medicine . According to Cochrane , " The Histories of Thucydides represent an attempt to apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed in the art of healing , and constitute an exact parallel to the attempts of modern scientific historians to apply evolutionary canons of interpretation derived from Darwinian science " ( 1929:3 ) . Hippocrates ' Ancient Medicine " stands out for all time as the first clear statement of the principles of rational empiricism " ( Cochrane 1929:7 ) . Thucydides applied these principles to the study of society and history and attempted " to bring all human action within the realm of natural causes " ( Cochrane 1929:17 ) . But whereas in medical science there were three stages ? diagnosis , prognosis , and therapy ? Thucydides confined himself to the first two , considering therapeutics to be the province of philosophy . It was Thucydides ' objectivity and detachment that made him a good historian ( Cochrane 1929 ) . He accepted the view " that life itself is the real teacher of mankind , " and that it is necessary to know " how men do in fact behave , before considering how they should " ( Cochrane 1929:32 ) . Thucydides was explicit in seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Momigliano 1977 ) : " The accurate knowledge of what has happened will be useful , because according to human probability , similar things will happen again " ( quoted in Bury 1909:243 ) . Respect for the facts and an attempt to interpret them as a physician interprets symptoms yield prognoses or predictions that turn history into political science ( Cochrane 1929 ) . Thucydides chose his historical topic ? the Peloponnesian War ? in keeping with his utilitarian views , and then fastened upon those personalities and events that were of demonstrable relevance to the topic ( Cochrane 1929 ) . Thucydides considered personality to be a factor that had to be taken into account to understand history , and he set the standard for the psychological interpretation of history that long prevailed . But he was not as extreme in this as was Thomas Carlyle in his Great Man theory of history . Moreover , Thucydides always related genius to the circumstances that gave it scope ( Cochrane 1929 ) . Thucydides , like Hippocrates , considered human  | nature to be more or less uniform and stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1929 ) . As already mentioned in passing , Thucydides was no less a sociologist and political scientist than a historian . He was a sociologist because he applied scientific standards to an attempt to outline the development of Greek society and to offer a prognosis on the disease of war that had the Greeks in its grip in his time ( Cochrane 1929 ) . Furthermore , Thucydides did not envision society as an organism but considered " the problem of society and of history from the view of the relationship of individuals to the group " ( Cochrane 1929:23 ) . Cochrane credits Thucydides with offering " the first suggestion of a classification of states along the lines of rational empiricism " and says that the scientific view of Thucydides " visualized the relations of men as determined by considerations of power and interest " ( 1929:47 , 94 ) According to Cochrane , no one surpassed the high standard set by Thucydides until modern times . Only the Old Oligarch , the unidentified author of The Constitution of the Athenians , came close in ancient times . Polybius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the narrative portions of his history of Rome but stumbled badly , according to Cochrane , in his cyclical analysis of constitutions ( cf. Walbank 1966 ) . St. Augustine also came close , but only with Machiavelli does the possibility of real improvement come , and it was not to be fully realized until the nineteenth-century work of Barthold Niebuhr ( Cochrane 1929 ) . Starr ( 1968 ) agrees with the relationship between Greek historical writing and science ? especially medicine ( and anthropology ) , as embodied in Hippocrates ' On Airs , Waters , Places ? but argues that this relationship was already implicit in Herodotus . Thucydides thus differs from Herodotus only in making historical science more conscious of its method and then adhering more rigorously to that method . The essentials of Thucydides ' more rigorous method also greatly narrowed the scope of history . Whereas Thucydides agreed with Herodotus in relying almost exclusively on oral information , Thucydides believed that Herodotus had been led to error by not restricting his research to what he himself had witnessed or to other eyewitness or participant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making it essentially contemporary . Moreover , he narrowed the topics of history to politics and war , because of their potency as factors of change . In the Western world before the nineteenth century , only contemporary or very recent politico- military history was considered " real " history . When more remote periods were studied , only materials prepared under Thucydidean standards were utilized . Archival sources ( assuming they existed ) and other written sources were largely ignored . Thus what Thucydides gained in rigor was not without its costs ( Momigliano 1966 , 1977 , 1978b ; Starr 1968 ) . In an important sense , the classical Greek historians began a tradition that continued with only relatively minor interruptions until the fall of Byzantium . But for the purposes of this chapter , Polybius serves well as a final example . He was writing after Rome had conquered Greece and had brought much of the known world under its sway . Indeed , Polybius was conscious of initiating and writing a universal history , which he began while he was being held in Rome as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries after Thucydides , Polybius was an innovator in certain ways , and yet he was also among those who " consolidated the Thucydidean approach " ( Momigliano 1966:215 ) . Given his subject matter , he marks the transition to the development of Roman historiography ( Bury 1909 , Walbank 1966 ) . Most of the Greek historians had undertaken institutional analyses , but book 6 of Polybius 's Histories provided the most sustained discussion of this topic by a prominent historian . He argued that constitutions tended to go through a typical cycle of transformations but that both Sparta and Rome had broken the cycle and had achieved stability by combining the best features of different constitutions . According to Walbank ( 1966 ) , Polybius 's analysis of the Roman constitution was one of two essential parts of his comprehensive attempt to explain Rome 's rapid rise to dominance . However , subsequent events sharply altered Polybius 's views on Roman constitutional stability ( Bury 1909 ) . As I have already noted , Cochrane ( 1929 ) considered book 6 an unforgivable lapse from scientific standards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , credits the Greek ( and Roman ) historians with insights into the causes of revolutions that were considerably better than their understandings of the causes of war ? precisely because the historians could utilize the results of philosophers ' extensive studies of constitutions ( see also Bury 1909 ) . Polybius also provided a more extensive discussion of historical standards and methods . Largely in agreement with Thucydides , Polybius set forth three requisites of historical research : " study and criticism of the sources , " " personal knowledge of lands and places , " and " political experience " ( Bury 1909:197 ) . He commented critically and in detail on the historiographical flaws in his predecessors ' works and set forth his own  | principles so clearly that he provided virtually a " handbook of historical method " ( Bury 1909:212 ; see also McDonald 1954 and Walbank 1966 ) . Although he was not alone in emphasizing the instructional value of history , Polybius put exceptional stress on its practical utility . He was writing for statesmen , who must understand causes and the interrelations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style and avoided rhetorical excess . He wrote to instruct , not to entertain ( Bury 1909 ; Momigliano 1966 , 1978a , 1978b , Walbank 1966 ) . Polybius gave considerable attention to Fortune ( Tyche ) , which , according to Walbank ( 1966 ) , was the second essential part of Polybius 's explanation of Roman dominance . According to Bury ( 1909 ) , this emphasis on Fortune was especially true of Polybius 's earlier writing , but as his experience deepened and his writings progressed , he eventually abandoned recourse to Fortune as an important factor in historical explanation . He " came to entertain the view that nothing happens without a natural cause , and the operation of Tyche or chance is , in general , an invalid assumption " ( Bury 1909:203 ) . The supernatural was even less a part of his causal explanations . Polybius considered religion " the keystone of the Roman state , " but only because the masses needed it ; " wise men " had no need for religion ( Bury 1909:215 ) . " Like Thucydides and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance of the individual in history " ( Bury 1909:212 ) . He dissected character but criticized the inclusion of needless biographical detail . He thought deeply about individual and mass psychology , and about national character and its relationship to the physical and institutional environment ( Bury 1909 ) . Polybius was remarkably impartial in his allocation of both praise and blame , for he found the character of individuals to be inconsistent , changing according to circumstances and over time ( Bury 1909 , Walbank 1966 ) . Because of his impartial and intelligent devotion to the truth , Polybius stands out among the ancients . For the period his writings cover , he remains an indispensable source ( Bury 1909 , Walbank 1966 ) . This is not to say , however , that Polybius avoided the shortcomings of the writings of most or all the ancient Greek ( and Roman ) historians . In addition to a narrow emphasis on politics and war , these included a difficulty in accounting for gradual social change and little concern for economic factors . Methodologically , Polybius continued the reliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bury 1909 ; Momigliano 1977 ; Walbank : 966 ) .  | But historians were not the only Greek students of the past . Alongside Thucydidean history grew the various antiquarian studies . These included local histories , descriptions of monuments , lists of secular and sacred officials , collections of constitutions , linguistic studies , and the like . Unlike the historians proper , antiquarians often did draw on archival and other written sources . It was only in the eighteenth century that the ancient distinction between history and antiquarian studies began to dissolve ( Momigliano 1966 , 1978b ) . For whatever reasons , then , by the fifth century a broad interest in the objective study of the past had developed among various Greek peoples ? certainly the Athenians . Both the historians and the antiquarians of that period were to have many successors over the next several centuries ( Starr 1968 ) . Developments in related nonhistorical areas , such as ethnology , sociology , and political science , should also be kept in mind ( Momigliano 1978b ; Starr 1968 ) . Also , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed along with the Greek sense of history , but even for Athens too little is known about this aspect of the sense of the past to allow for detailed comment ( see , e.g. , Starr 1968 ) . Biography as a distinct genre grew alongside of history as one of the antiquarian studies . But history , too , had a personality base . While most authorities consider Greek historiography in general to have been an independent development ( see , e.g. , Starr 1968 ) , Momigliano ( 1977 ) does not preclude the possibility that Greek biography owed something to Persian or other Eastern models ( many of the Ionian cities were in Persian territory ) . To some extent , the Greek concern with the individual and biography may have reflected the marked individualism that developed in Athens . Biography became much more important in Alexandrian and Roman Greece than it was in the fifth century ( Momigliano 1966 , 1977,1978b ; Starr 1968 ) . Somewhat related was the concern for understanding human nature . According to Momigliano ( 1966:214-15 ) , Thucydides concentrated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning of human effort . By understanding the political life of the present . . . he believed that he had understood the nature of man in its perennial elements . " " He was at pains to understand the Peloponnesian War as the sum of human nature . " ( Greek ideas on human nature are discussed further below . ) The Greek interest in biography , personality , and human nature was apparent in the arts too . Statues of named individuals became increasingly common , as did the practice of signing works of art . Poetry and drama  | were no less oriented to concrete individuals . On the other hand , although the Greeks grew ever more competent at depicting the human figure and spirit , the classical sculptors were more concerned with depicting ideal figures than with capturing the unique features of particular individuals . It was not until the fourth century B.C. that literary characterization and true portraiture reached their fullest development ( Ashmole 1964 ; Breckenridge 1968 ; Starr 1968 ) . Breckenridge ( 1968 ) sees a nexus between individualism , realistic portraiture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ancient Greece . He sees a portrait of Aristotle , probably made during his lifetime , as " the first portrait of an individual in the strongly realistic sense of the word " ( 1968:12o ) . For Aristotle , mind and soul could only be apprehended through the physical appearance and action of the individual , thus establishing " the fundamental premise of the scientific method " ( Breckenridge 1968:123 ) . " Only when such an attitude toward physical reality is accepted , " Breckenridge ( 1968:123 ) suggests , " is portraiture in its most fully developed sense a possibility . " This materialistic attitude corresponds with the secularism typical of open societies . Theophrastus 's book Characters ( 319 B.C. ) , which was organized around personality types rather than occupations and thus marked a new level of literary naturalism , coincided closely with the pinnacle of realistic portraiture in ancient Greece ( Breckenridge 1968 ) . The classical Greek contributions to natural science have already been alluded to . The Greek contribution to education and to a secular view of society are too well known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history played only a small role in the educational curriculum of the classical Greeks ( Momigliano 1977 , 1978b ; Starr 1968 ) . The other contrast presented by the Greeks is that between Athens and Sparta . Many of the generalizations made about the Greeks are more properly generalizations about Athenian society or , more broadly , the Ionian branch of the Greek-speaking peoples . Although they were not all Ionian in origin , all or very nearly all the Greek historians wrote in the Ionian dialect ( Pearson 1939 ) . It was well known even in antiquity that the Spartans were strikingly anomalous in many ways ( Cochrane 1929 ; Michell 1952 ) . In some respects , perhaps , the whole branch to which the Spartans belonged ? the Dorian ? differed from the Ionian . The difference of greatest importance here is that the " Spartans had short memories " ( Jones 1967:1 ) . In the period when historical writing developed and flo-resced in Athens - and when Sparta was scarcely less a power in the Greek  | world ? no Spartans wrote history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B.C. , and what was produced then was a work of antiquarianism rather than political history ( Forrest 1968 ) . It is not certain that any contemporary literary source on Sparta before the Roman period was actually written by a Spartan ( Chrimes 1942 ) . Michell ( 1952 ) is not certain that the Spartans were even taught to read and write ! Not only did the Spartans not write their own history , they were downright secretive about their affairs , making it difficult for anyone else to compose a political history of Sparta ( Forrest 1968 ; Huxley 1962 ; Michell 1952 ) . It may have been the deliberate policy of the Spartans not only to be secretive but also deliberately to mislead outsiders ( Chrimes 1942 ) . In addition , there is no evidence of state archives in Sparta ( Huxley 1962 ) . Except for the Roman period , epigraphical materials are meager : there were no inscribed lists of magistrates , decrees , or laws ( Chrimes 1942 ) . An apparent or partial exception was the support Xenophon received in Sparta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an Athenian citizen by birth , but during a lengthy exile he lived in Spartan territory . In this period he wrote some of his historical works ( Bury 1937 n.d. ; Momigliano 1977 ) , but only one was specifically about Sparta , The Constitution of the Spartans . A translation of this work is prefaced by the statement : " This work furnishes us with what amounts to the official Spartan view ... though it can scarcely be considered as genuine history " ( Godolphin 1942:II , 658 ) . Another of Xenophon 's works , the Hellenica , treats Sparta in various parts , and yet it is these very parts that draw sharp criticisms of bias and unfortunate recourse to divine interference as a cause of events ( Godolphin 1942:1 , ) xxi ? xxxii ) . In short , whatever strengths Xenophon may have had as a historian , they do not unambiguously make him a historian of Sparta , even though he did live and write within Spartan lands . There was some sort of oral tradition in Sparta , and the Spartans were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past ( Momigliano 1978b ; Starr 1968 ) . Huxley 1962 mentions genealogical poetry based on king lists , and an elaborate mythology of royal houses . Sparta ultimately acquired a reputation for considerable stability , as illustrated in Polybius 's comparison of the constitutions of Sparta and Rome . Forrest ( 1968:18 ) argues that the Spartans took pride in this , and that " change was therefore unthinkable . " When in the third century , Forrest continues , change was obviously required , the Spartans generated a new myth of the past so that the required changes could pass for a restoration of ancient conditions .  | Although their fellow Greeks were enormously curious about the Spartans , the foregoing makes it clear that attempts to reconstruct the nature of Spartan society will not be without their difficulties . These difficulties are compounded by the fact that much of what was written about classical Sparta was written by men associated with Athens , which for long was Sparta 's principal rival ( Chrimes 1942 ) . However , let us face that problem later , turning first to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry of the ancient Greeks indicates that they originally possessed hereditary kings and nobles , both descended from the gods . M. I. Finley provides an authoritative and concise description of social stratification in Homeric Greece ( c. eighth to seventh centuries B.C. ) : A deep horizontal cleavage marked the world of the Homeric poems . Above the line were the aristoi , literally the " best people , " the hereditary nobles who held most of the wealth and all the power , in peace as in war . Below were all the others . ... The gap between the two was rarely crossed , except by the inevitable accidents of wars and raids . The economy was such that the creation of new fortunes , and thereby of new nobles , was out of the question . Marriage was strictly class-bound , so that the other door to social advancement was also securely locked . ( 1962:61 ) Baldry ( 1965:15 ) adds further detail : " Homer regularly assumes that there is a hereditary physical difference between nobles and the multitude , a natural division separating them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " Before turning to the classical Greeks , we may note that divination , which was to become a significant element in Greek culture , was not very important in Homer ( Hastings 1928:IV ) . The development of cities , trade , and industry ushered in more open societies among the Greeks . New classes arose , and by the seventh century B.C .. most conditions were ready for stratification based on wealth . In the sixth century B.C. , coinage was introduced and stratification by wealth was legally established . Democratic tendencies were strengthened by the refirms of Cleisthenes late in the century ( Baldry 1965 ; Bury 1937 n.d. ; Finley 1962 ; Starr 1968 ) . Let us look more closely at the sixth and fifth centuries . An important issue to examine is slavery . It is sometimes argued that since Athens was a slave state , it does not really count as the sort of open and democratic society found in various parts of the modern world , and that the difference between democratic Athens and the oligarchic Greek societies , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mere difference in the size and structure of oligarchies ( Cochrane 1929 ; Forrest 1968 ) . Without at the same time providing evidence , Finley ( 1973:15 ) , for example , states that " the Athenian demos was a minority elite from which a large slave population was totally excluded . " If females and children are not counted in the demos , Finley 's statement may well be correct . But elsewhere ( 1959 ) he takes a more cautious line . He provides considerable evidence for substantial numbers of slaves in Athens but stops short of saying that they outnumbered the free populace . In part this reflects the obscurity of the data ; in part it reflects his view that the precise number or proportion of slaves is not the most important fact in assessing the economic importance of slavery ( Finley 1959 ) . Cochrane ( 1929 ) had earlier noted that the data were poor on this subject , and no doubt we should keep an open mind on the proportion of slave to free in Athens . But recent students of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicinity ( i.e. , Attica ) at no more than one-third of the populace , probably as little as one-fourth ( Hopkins 1978 ; Starr 1958 ; Westermann 1955 ) . Even more important than the proportion of slaves was the permeability of the boundary that separated the various strata of ancient Athens . All authorities agree that the boundaries were open and that movement occurred in both directions . " Slave status might fortuitously be the lot of any person , " and from the time of the Persian Wars to the time of Alexander , " the transition of status of individuals from freedom to slave condition and conversely from slavery through manumission to free status occurred with greater frequency and ease " ( Westermann 1955:5 ) . Finley ( 1959 ) also notes that anyone , regardless of status , could become a slave . On the other hand , manumission , which Finley ( 1959:160 ) says was an important incentive for the slaves , was a normal procedure : " we are baffled by the absence of numbers , but it was a common phenomenon in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excellent account of the ideological accompaniments of the change in Greek society from hereditary to open stratification . As time went by , " in the eyes of a minority at any rate , wisdom took the place of birth or wealth as the mark of the good ' members of society " ( 1965:5 ) . In Aristophanes ' plays , written at the close of the fifth century , Baldry notes evidence of " the breakdown of the traditional respect for the aristocracy and the rejection of the division of society , which we first saw in Homer , into a well-born upper class and a humble mass of common folk " ( 1965 : 33-34 ) . The rise of a moneyed class , says l akin ' , was largely  | responsible . This process was sharply accelerated in the last part of the fifth century , and the ideal of nobility was " finally crushed " ( 1965:34 ) . For a considerable period the old and the new ideals clashed . Ion of Chios ( d. 442 B.C. ) , for example , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one could usually tell a noble by his appearance ( Baldry 1965 ) . Baldry cites many contrary views as time passes . For example , a speaker in a lost play by Euripides ( c. 48o-c. 4-07 B.C. ) " debunks nobility ' as merely a matter of hard cash : ' That man is noble , in whose house wealth stays the longest ' " ( 1965:36 ) . Menander ( c. 342 ? 291 B.C. ) spoke on behalf of merit over blood : " If nature 's given a man good character by birth , then he 's well-born , even though he comes from Ethiopia " ( Baldry 1965:138 ) . Baldry says that the dominant theme about humanity in Menander " is the thought that character . . . matters above all else , and can transcend all the divisions of race and class . " " Menander sets up merit as a universal standard " ( Baldry 1965:139 ? 40 ) . Thucydides himself , in the Peloponnesian War ( ii , 37 ) , put a defense of meritocracy in the mouth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal justice for all alike , . . . the claim of excellence is also recognized ; and when a citizen is in any way distinguished , he is preferred to the public service , not as a matter of privilege , but as the reward of merit . Neither is poverty a bar , but a man may benefit his country whatever be the obscurity of his condition " ( Godolphin 1942:I , 648 ) . In the time of Pericles ( c. 490 ? 429 B.C. ) , full Athenian citizenship ? the most coveted status ? was by no means easy to achieve ( Cochrane 1929 ; Michell 1952 ) , but it was not impossible . Frost ( 1987 ) describes social mobility among Greek slaves and recounts the life of a slave who ultimately achieved full citizenship and was reputedly the wealthiest man in Athens when he died . The relatively lenient treatment of slaves in Athens , and the difficulty of distinguishing them from free men in dress , appearance , and even occupation is noted by many authorities ( Cochrane 1929 ; Westermann tvcs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science and of scientific history in Periclean Athens , Cochrane ( 1929 ) dwells at length on the problem of whether Athens really did differ from its neighbors . He says that even if Athens failed in some ways to live up to its high principles , it was more than a democracy in principle . Although the aristocrats might grumble , a substantial middle class shared power with the commercial class and the large proletariat . In spite of the existence of slavery , " the spirit and atmosphere of the state was that of liberty and equality " ( 1929:98 ) . It may be recalled that two of the most famous Athenians ? Plato and  | Aristotle ? spoke of slavery as natural , Plato being the more unequivocal on the point . ( Plato was a member of the old aristocracy . ) Rifkin ( 1953 ) argues effectively that the very fact that the two philosophers defend slavery at such length reveals that the ideal of natural equality must have been powerful at that time . Thus , Aristotle quoted Alcidamas as saying , " God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man a slave " ( Baldry 1965:205 n. 7 ) . We should also note that to say slavery is natural is not to say that it is hereditary . Both Aristotle and Plato were fully aware of the biological unity of the human race ( Baldry 1965 ) . And if the Old Oligarch could claim " that the upper class was the wisest , Socrates ' followers could maintain that the wisest should be the upper class " ( Baldry 1965:56 ) . Whatever the general thrust of Aristotle 's and Plato 's views , therefore , they were by no means unequivocally hereditarian or representative of the full spectrum of Greek opinion . Cochrane ( 1929 ) adds that whereas philosophers saw men as composed of gold and baser metals , Greek science knew nothing of such distinctions . In the entire corpus of Hippocratic treatises , in which the phrase the " nature of man " is common , it is nowhere " stated or implied that man 's basic nature differs according to whether he is noble or humble , rich or poor , Greek or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the contrary , Hippocrates ' On Airs , Waters , Places , traces human differences to the effects of the environment acting on an essentially uniform human material ( Baldry 1965 ; Cochrane 1929 ) . The Hippocratic Oath demanded similar treatment for all ( Baldry 1965 ) . The main argument of Baldry 's book is that the idea of the unity of mankind was fully developed in Greek society . Cochrane ( 1929:23 , 24 ) draws attention to individualism in Athens : Thucydides was a child of Periclean Athens , " which was characterized by " intense individualism " ( see also Baldry 1965 on the individualism of the cynics , and Bury 19371 n.d. on the individualism fostered by Socrates ) . Perhaps of no less interest , Solon ( 638 ? ? 559 B.C. ) ? whose reforms put the stamp of approval on social mobility ? was the first Athenian " political figure to stand out as a real personality in Greek history " ( Starr 1968:67 ) . In spite of its rapidly developing connection with Athens as Athens became the spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginnings not in Athens but in those portions of the Persian Empire where Greeks were numerous . Even there , however , a connection between social mobility and historiography is discernible . According to Momigliano , " The atmosphere of vigorous personal initiative which Persia aroused and partly encouraged was probably responsible for the attention paid by  | Herodotus ? and presumably by ... Hecataeus ? to their own and other people 's personal experience " ( 1977:30 ) . Pearson ( 1939:14 ) adds that the Ionian cities in Persia were democratic . In sum , we may note three points . First , individual social mobility was ideologically and legally a fact of life in Ionia generally and in Athens in particular . Second , rates of mobility seem substantial , and certainly expectable if we consider the rapid growth of Athenian hegemony . Third , historians of Greek historiography have actually noted some connection between these social conditions and the rise of Greek historiography . What of Sparta ? Conditions were wholly different there from the sixth through the fourth centuries B.C. In an extensive analysis of slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sparta , because its system of serfdom ? helotry ? more or less precluded the need for slavery as he understood the term . However , most authorities do refer to the Spartan helots as slaves , the difference being that they were tied to the soil of the state : no individual could either manumit or sell them overseas . Hence their status was hereditary ; only rarely could they achieve freedom ( Cochrane 1929 ; Forrest 1968 ; Chrimes 1942 ; Jones 1967 ; Michell 1952 ) . The term caste is regularly used in describing Spartan social structure , as in Michell 's description of the dominant caste , the Spartiates , as " the most exclusive economical and political caste in all Greece " ( 1952:29 ) . There were three principal strata in the Spartan social structure during the period of Spartan greatness : at the top were the Spartiates , a military caste raised under strict conditions and ruled by two kings , a council , and an assembly but considering all save the kings to be equals before the law . A Spartiate could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this does not seem to have been a very common occurrence ( Chrimes 1942 ; Jones 1967 ; Michell 1952 ) . Ranking beneath the Spartiates were the perioikoi ( dwellers around ) , inhabitants of areas conquered by the Spartans . Though clearly subordinate to the Spartiates , the perioikoi were in some senses like allies . They lived in autonomous cities , paid rent to the Spartiates , and served in the army . They outnumbered the Spartiates and could not easily enter their stratum , if at all ( Chrimes 1942 ; Jones 1967 ; Michell 1952 ) . Beneath the perioikoi in status were the helots . The standard estimate of ' their proportions , based on a reference to 479 B.C. , is that they outnumbered the Spartiates by seven to one ( Huxley 1962 ; Jones 1967 ; cf. Chrimes 1942 ) . This proportion may he suspect , but all the authorities agree that the helots substantially outnumbered the Spartiates . Finley , who  | inclines to the high side in estimating the proportion of slaves in Athens , does not narrow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helots : they " outnumbered the free population on a scale without parallel in other Greek communities " ( 1959:158 ) . He sees the contrast as no less sharp on the matter of social mobility . After his comments on the commonness of manumission in Athens , he adds : " This is an important difference between the Greek slave on the one hand , and the helot ... on the other " ( 1959:160 ) . There is some evidence that both the perioikoi and the helots were considered " aborigines , " and the Spartiates a conquering , invading race . Some have argued , however , that the helots were in fact Dorians who had been reduced to their humble status ( Huxley 1962 ; Michell 1952 ) . ( This is a familiar debate about the origins of long-standing caste systems . ) In very early times ? up to the seventh through early fifth centuries ? the helots may not have been so numerous in Sparta , but in those times Sparta was less anomalous in other respects , too ? showing , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Huxley 1962 ; Jones 1967 ; Michell 1952 ) . By the third century the helots may have receded to insignificance again ( Chrimes 1942 ) . But in between , the helots , a hereditarily repressed majority , were a prominent feature of the Spartan social structure , no less important than the secretive , highly disciplined military caste that ruled them . At the same time , no Spartans wrote history ; only in the third century was a weak beginning made on writing Spartan history and keeping the materials needed to compile its history in later times . It was apparent to contemporaries that helotry was a highly significant aspect of Spartan society . Thucydides noted that most Spartan institutions were designed to guard against the danger presented by the helots ( Michell 1952 ) . For example , it was alleged in antiquity that the Spartiates annually declared war on the helots so they could be killed without the religious implications normal to murder ( Jones 1967 ; Michell 1952 ) . Aristotle thought Sparta 's political system was worthy but that social system was fatally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for social mobility " ( Forrest 1968 ) . Modern writers are no less inclined to attribute the generally depressed state of art and science in Sparta to the attention the Spartiates were forced to give to their subject populace ; " holding down a sullen and resentful peasantry " was like living " on top of a volcano " ( Michell 1952:3 , 28 ) . It entailed eternal preparation for war , which in turn was the root of Sparta 's deliberate policy of secrecy ( ( ; primes 1942 ) . Secrecy was particularly as- sociated with the helots ; Huxley noted that " the Spartans veiled their treatment of them in secrecy " ( 1962:95 ) . Spartan education has long been famous , for peculiar reasons . As noted above , Spartan education may not have included reading and writing . It was rigidly designed to foster the esprit de corps of a small , militaristic caste . It bred a respect for the collective good that left little room for the development of individualism . Bury notes the paradox in Plato 's and Xenophon 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Socrates , whose lifework had been to foster individualism . In " Sparta ... their beloved master would not have been suffered so much as to open his mouth " ( Bury 1937:566 ) . Sparta was almost perversely the opposite of Athens . In Sparta neither natural science , nor political science , nor any other social science flourished . Although Breckenridge 1968 notes that the Spartans commissioned portrait sculptures at Delphi in 404 B.C. at the end of their war with Athens , none of the artists appears to have been Spartan , and others state that the onceflourishing arts of Sparta languished after the sixth century B.C. ( Jones 1967 ; Michell 1952 ) . Literary portraiture in Sparta did not develop either . The individual was molded to his role in a simplified organic state . A myth of unchanging stability was fostered , concern for genealogy was strong . The Spartans were fond of stories of the past , probably part of an oral tradition , but there is little evidence that these stories were substantially accurate . The Spartans did not write history when their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when most of their neighbors did not . In summary , the contrasts examined in the Greek setting ? ancient Greeks versus classical Greeks , and Athenian or Ionian Greeks versus Spartans ? provide strong evidence for the relationship between social stratification and historiography and tend to support the concomitants too . Divided into three major periods , Roman history stretches from the legendary founding of Rome in the eighth century B.C. to nearly the sixth century A.1 ) . ( excluding the Byzantine period ) . In the earliest period , Rome was allegedly ruled by kings , the last of whom was expelled in about 500 B.C .. In the next period , which lasted almost five centuries , Rome possessed a republican form of government . In the several decades surrounding the  | birth of Christ , the republic collapsed , giving way to a period of government under emperors . The republican and imperial periods in turn have conventional subdivisions . For the present purposes , the most important is the period of Rome 's decline , stretching through the third to fifth centuries A.D. This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to distinguish the western and eastern halves of the empire , a division ultimately recognized by a system of co-emperors : one in Rome , one in Constantinople . Most authorities do not consider the Romans to have begun writing history until some time late in the third century B.C. ( Martin 1981 ) . This observation needs two qualifications . First , the Romans did maintain historical materials earlier , and if they did not possess forms of history that would pass muster as literature , they did nonetheless possess rudimentary forms of historical writing well before the second century B.C. They maintained treaties , laws , family records , and the yearly records of the pontifices ( the principal ritual officials ) . The pontifical annals recorded famines , eclipses , lists of consuls ( the chief magistrates ) , and triumphs ( Badian 1966 ; Martin 1981 ; Walsh 1966 ) . Second , it was not merely histories that the Romans lacked before the second century B.C. , but almost all forms of literature ( Badian 1966 ) . Late in the third century , Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fabius Pictor . He wrote Rome 's history from early times up to the first of the wars with the Phoenicians of Carthage ? the Punic Wars . His writings were morally and politically committed , somewhat autobiographical , annalistic , and written in Greek . The time was ripe for borrowing Greek ideas , and he was quickly imitated ( Badian 1966 ) . Thompson ( 1942:I ) lists four commendable annalists from about the middle of the second century B.C. Another figure , Gnaeus Genius , wrote in the same century on cultural anthropology . He also wrote annals , drawing on the material in the pontifical annals , and was notable for the attention he gave to portents , which became a staple of Roman annalistic writings ( Badian 1966 ) . Probably the first Roman to write Roman history in Latin was Cato the Elder ( 234 ? 149 B.C. ) . He wrote in the Greek tradition , showing a lively interest in geography and natural science " but particularly in human life , customs , and character " ( Badian 1966:8 ) . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wrote political autobiography and contemporary history . Cato established Latin historical writing  | and was much imitated ( save in one respect : so that the common soldiers would be credited with Rome 's victories , he omitted personal names ) . Many fragments of his work survive ( Badian 1966 ; Thompson 1942:I ) . Gaius Fannius ( consul in 122 B.C. ) improved on Cato , but at almost the same time another important historiographic milestone was passed when in 133 B.C. the Pontifex Maximus published the pontifical annals , the Annales Maximi , in eighty books ( Martin 1981 ) . They had always been available to the senators , even if not often consulted . When available to the public , they established a basic framework for Rome 's history . Their publication also made it possible for nonsenators to write history . Senators thereafter concentrated mostly on contemporary history , and annalistic writing fell to men who , working in their studies , had little experience with public affairs . The later annalists did not maintain high historiographic standards , but they were popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B.c. ) found an alleged alternative set of ancient documents that differed in some ways from the pontifical annals . He is credited with consulting various unpublished sources , with being conscientious , and with maintaining a careful chronology ( Badian 1966 ; Martin 1981 ; Thompson 1942:I ) . The monograph was introduced by Lucius Coelius Antipater , who wrote a history of the Hannibalic ( Second Punic ) War after 121 B.C. He chose his sources carefully ; where they conflicted , he consulted documents and other sources , including a Carthaginian history . He was a " serious " historian who strove for accuracy . In the long run his influence was very great ( Radian 1966 ; Hammond and Scullard 1970 ; Martin 1981 ; Thompson 1942:I ) . Sempronius Asellio ( born e.16o B.C. ) compiled a notable set of memoirs . Judging from the fragments that survive , he consciously aimed not merely to relate facts but to give causal analyses . Possibly influenced by Polybius , Asellio distinguished " pragmatic " history from annals . This was a new conception of history in Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1942:I ) . Before the end of the second century , contemporary history began to add an autobiographical dimension . Marcus Aemilius Scaurus , for a quarter of a century the chief senator , and probably the most powerful man of his time , was the first to write a straightforward autobiography , probably in the nineties B.C. A more important autobiography followed shortly , written by P. Rutilius Rufus ( horn c. 150 B.C. ) , an important Stoic philosopher who also wrote a history ( Badian 1966 ) . Politicians ' memoirs became a prominent genre .  | Lucius Cornelius Sisenna ( died c. 67 B.C. ) wrote a history of Rome 's Social and Civil Wars , rejecting excessive concern for chronology in favor of " grouping by subject matter " ( Badian 1966:26 ) . The age of Cicero ( 106 ? 43 B.c. ) ? centered on the final decades of the Republic ? saw significant antiquarian research by Atticus and Varro ( among others ) and the writings of Julius Caesar ( d. 44 B.C. ) . Atticus produced a chronology of world , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven hundred volumes ( Shotwell 1923 ) . Caesar 's Commentaries ? the most notable of the political memoirs ? were historiographically distinguished ( Badian 1966 ) . In his Gallic War Caesar maintained the standards of Thucydides and Polybius , placing accuracy above style ( Dorey , " Caesar , " 1966 ) . Cicero was not a historian in the usual sense of the word , but his writings bordered on contemporary history and provide us with our most detailed understanding of any Roman period . Moreover , his comments on the theory of history have been very influential . Cicero thought that he should write a history of Rome ( McKeon 1950 ) . One of his contemporaries , Cornelius Nepos , agreed , lamenting on Cicero 's death that it was uncertain " whether history or the Republic lost more " ( quoted in McKeon 1950:16 ) . Fortunately , according to Nepos , Cicero 's letters were themselves a near substitute for history : Whoever reads them does not have much need of a sequential history of those times . For there , all the details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders , the revolutions of the Republic are so set forth that nothing in them is left in doubt , and it can easily be said that prudence becomes in a manner divination . For Cicero not only predicted future events which did indeed occur in his own lifetime , but also rendered oracles worthy of a prophet concerning events which are now coming to pass . ( Quoted in McKeon 1950:16 ) Cicero 's speeches , as was typical of the time , were centered on concrete individuals , their policies and practices . Praise and blame were normal parts of political oratory , as was detailed reasoning on the consequences of one or another proposed policy ( Rawson 1975 ) . A careful microhistorical analysis of cause and effect in public policy was essential in effective public oratory . Cicero stressed the practical value of history , particularly in matters of public morals and politics ( McKeon 1950 ) , and he developed notions of probability and causality ( McKeon 1950 ) . In the De Officius ( On duties ) he says that men , " blessed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can foresee consequences , understand the reasons for events and even anticipate them , and apprehend causality , are able to compare  | like with like and , by interweaving and reconciling present and future , easily to evaluate the whole of life and adequately to prepare to live it " ( Cicero 1950:470 ) . Interestingly , Cicero noted that the " truth of history " was " much corrupted " by accounts of their ancestors that " families of note " produced ( quoted by Shotwell 1923:225 ) . It was in Cicero 's time that the Roman state began to maintain state archives ( Thompson 1942:I ) . By the time of Cicero 's death , Roman historiography had reached its full development , by then including the traditional annals , contemporary history , antiquarian studies , and political autobiography ( Badian 1966 ) . In Cicero 's view , however , no Roman had yet managed to pull it all together in a work that would rival the best of the Greeks ' because the Romans were still deficient in " rhetorical embellishment " ( Martin 1981:19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meantime , C. Sallustius Crispus ( c. 86 ? 34 B.C. ) , the " first great Roman historian , " ( Thompson 1942:I , 70 ) wrote history from an antiestablishment viewpoint , trying to analyze the sources of decay in the state . He considered his analysis to be of practical use in statecraft . Sallust was particularly good in his depiction of character , and he borrowed from Thucydides a special attention to the sharp contrast between what people said and what they did ( though he failed to note this trait in himself ) . Sallust " laid down the model and categories of Roman historiography for ever after " ( Syme 19391 1979:249 ) and was probably a successful historian in his own time ( Paul 1966 ; Martin 1981 ) . Among the major Roman historians only Livy ( 59 or 64 B.C. ? C. A.D. 17 ) had no practical experience in political affairs , though he was directly patronized by the emperor Augustus . His style was good and he wrote prodigiously . His Ad urbe condita ( From the founding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a modern book . He was judged to have met the Ciceronian ideal , although modern critics often give him more credit for style than for scientific history or sharp political analysis . For some purposes , however , he is excellent . Livy provided more information on social and economic conditions than did any other Roman historian , and he gave much information on religious feeling and Roman cults . He relied primarily on secondary sources , but if he found no single reliable source , he examined conflicting accounts with care and then reported the variations . Less concerned than most Roman historians with institutional analysis , he focused on the words and actions of people , providing much information on psychology , emotions , morals , motives , and character . It was his concern for motives , in fact , that led to an excess  | of moralizing ( Dorey , ed. , 1966 ; Martin 1981 ; McDonald 1954 ; Shotwell 1923 ; Walsh 1966 ) . Brief mention should be made of a contemporary of Livy , Trogus Pompeius , who wrote a Historiae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though written in Latin , its author was a Gaul by birth ( Thompson 1942:I ) . Contemporary political history suffered greatly with the advent of the imperial period , but various kinds of historical works were still written . Augustus ( r. 27 B.C. ? A.D. 14 ) suppressed political history but encouraged antiquarian studies ( McDonald 1954 ; Syme 1939 1979 ; Thompson 1942:I ) . The Emperor Claudius ( r . A.D. 41 ? 54 ) wrote an autobiography and was himself a prolific writer on antiquarian topics ( Thompson 1942:I ) . Rome was yet to produce her greatest historian , Tacitus ( A.D. 56 or 57-c. 120 ) . Tacitus 's intellectual heritage was primarily from Cato and Sallust . He wrote a biography of his father-in-law , De vita Iulii Agricolae , and an ethnography , the Germania . The latter included cultural and physical geography as well . The comparative perspective acquired in writing the Germania made Tacitus a better historian ( Martin 1981 ; see also McDonald 1954 ) . In his Histories Tacitus examined the causes of the rise and fall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " contains some of the most brilliant descriptive writing of any age or language " ( Martin 1981:68 ) . Martin also notes that in his Annals Tacitus used the " traditional framework of year-by-year narrative , " and yet he was the " most original of Roman historians " ( 1981:104 ) . We know that Tacitus presented some speeches with accuracy , and his fictitious speeches showed more individuality than was usual . Tacitus was quite aware of the difference between peoples ' motives and their statements , and between their statements and their actions . He was very good at seeing the complexity of things and was impartial in praise and blame ( Martin 1981 ; cf. Shotwell 1923 ) . Among the sources Tacitus consulted were memoirs , earlier historians , probably the acta senatus ( a daily gazette that had been instituted by Julius Caesar ) , biographies , autobiographies , occasional inscriptions , and some oral sources . He was critical of his sources , though he sometimes relied on only a few sources when more were available , and rarely can he he caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from the methods of his time , he achieved a " penetration " to the heart of matters that rivaled Thucydides and a pungency that was not matched in the Greco-Roman world ( Martin 1981 ) . Tacitus even achieved a sense of comparative histo- riography , noting that " the subject matter of history varies according as the constitution about which the historian writes is democracy , oligarchy , or monarchy " ( Martin 1981:137 ) . In spite of these strengths , Tacitus was not much read in Rome , because pragmatic or serious history " became unfashionable , " " giving way to imperial biography and panegyric " ( Martin 1981:236 ) . ( A decline in Roman historiography after Tacitus is noted by virtually all authorities . Two important exceptions will be noted shortly . ) The new importance of biography is well illustrated in the Lives of the Twelve Caesars , by Suetonius ( c . A.D. 75 ? 160 ) . He had been private secretary to the emperor Hadrian , but there is little reason to think that he used his position to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are lost , Suetonius wrote voluminously on history , antiquities , and especially on science . He was indifferent to political and military matters . His biographical method of writing history persisted into the Middle Ages ( Thompson 1942:I ) . The last of the sounder Latin historians in the classical genres was the pagan Ammianus Marcellinus ( born c. 330 ) . He showed a great interest in nobles and their origins ( Alfoldi 1952 ) , but he was born a Greek at Antioch . He wrote a history so filled with accurate and vivid material that we understand the political , diplomatic , and military situation of the period he covered ( 353 ? 378 ) better than any period after those described by Tacitus ( McDonald 1954 ; see also Momigliano 1977 ) . The two important exceptions to the general pattern of decline in historiography in the late empire resulted from the efforts of Greek writers in the eastern empire and from the initiation of church history . A series of authors writing in Greek wrote distinguished histories throughout the period that Romans ruled their lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wrote an eighty-volume history of Rome from moo B.C. to A.D. 235 . Although a conventional work , it and other Greek histories " to some extent made up for the deficiency " in Latin historical writing at the time ( Shotwell 1923:275 ; McDonald 1954 ; Thompson 1942:I ) Ammianus , though he wrote in Latin , can also be seen as part of this Greek tradition within the empire . Such creativity as occurred in historiography in the late empire was associated with the Church : comparative chronology , ecclesiastical history , and hagiography were important new genres , while citations of sources , footnotes , and appendices were introduced too ( Momigliano 1977 ; Thomp ? K ) n 1942:I ) . Eusebius of Caesarea ( c. 260 ? 340 ) , the " father of ecclesiastical history " and author of the " greatest of all church chronicles " ( Thompson 1942:1 , 128-29 ) , illustrates these developments . His Chronographia was a  | vast exercise in comparative chronology in two books : one established each people 's own chronology ; the other comprised a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the margins . Although its core was the Old Testament , the Chronographia was the first attempt to grasp the whole of history as a single entity ( Thompson 1942:I ) . Eusebius 's Historia Ecclesiastica presents a " co-ordinated , sustained , critical and interpretive history of the Church " ( Thompson 1942:I , 130 ) . On the other hand , Eusebius 's Life of Constantine ? more hagiography than biography ? " is without value as history " ( Thompson 1942:I , 130 ) . Eusebius was prolific and much imitated . Although Eusebius was not the only sound church historian ? St. Augustine 's City of God and his autobiographical Confessions , for example , were soon to be written ? there is substantial agreement that much Christian historiography was not sound . This will be discussed further in the next chapter . Little is known about Rome 's regal period , but at the dawn of the republican period the body of free Roman citizens consisted of patricians and plebs , the former monopolizing office . The dominant theme of early republican history is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plebs achieved effective equality and the right to intermarry with the patricians . The two-century struggle of the plebs culminated in 287 B.C. when decisions of plebiscites were recognized as binding Roman law . Patricians retained a certain social prestige into the imperial period , though they steadily dwindled in number . They also retained control of some offices ? mostly ritual offices ? until Caesar and the Triumvirs in a decade beginning in 43 B.C. opened virtually every high office and status to their henchmen ( Wiseman 1971 ) . Patricians could renounce their status , and in the early imperial period emperors gained the power to appoint people to patrician status ( Gelzer 1912 1969 ) . In the third century A.D. patricians disappeared as a status group . The term plebian had come to serve as a generic label for the lower orders of society ( Hammond and Scullard 1970 ) . In the middle of the republican period the dominant historical events were the three Punic Wars fought against the Phoenicians of Carthage in 264 ? 241 , 218 ? 201 , and 149 ? 146 B.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portions of the lands and trade surrounding the Mediterranean . As Rome 's power grew , so did its wealth and the opportunities  | for upward mobility ( Hill 1952 ; Wiseman 1971 ) . Under these conditions , a whole new " middle class " formed , eventually crystallizing around the equestrian order ( to be described below ) . The new class was counterposed against the senators ( Hill 1952 ) . Wealth , education , family , and officeholding became key elements in determining rank in the republican period . From very early times , Roman citizens had been divided into legal classes based on wealth ( Hammond and Scullard 1970 ; Gelzer 19121 1969 ) . Generally speaking , only persons in the wealthiest class could hold office , and the weight of an individual 's vote was effectively lessened to the degree that he fell in lower wealth classes ( Hammond and Scullard 1970 ; Taylor 1966 ) . Once the patricians had lost their position of superiority , Rome 's aristocracy was shaped by officeholding . Those who held the higher offices became eligible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was an expectation of the sons of senators becoming senators too ? provided , of course , that the wealth qualification continued to be met and that the son could win an office in a popular election . From the fourth century B.C. until the early empire no one became a senator without a decent education ( Gelzer 1969 ) and without winning office , presumably thereby demonstrating his merit ( Hammond and Scullard 1970 ; Hopkins 1974 ; Wiseman 1971 ) . The highest office was that of consul . The consuls ? there were normally two ? were the successors to the early Roman kings . Consuls held office for one year but could be reelected . The descendants of consuls were looked upon as nobility ( nobilis ) , though the status was not codified in law and " never became a closed caste " ( Hammond and Scullard 1970:736 ; Hill 1969 ) . The nobiles tried to prevent the admission of " new men " ( novi homines ) , i.e. , persons who were the first in their family line to hold consular office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win high offices and senatorial seats for their members and to keep new men out . The elite were aided in their attempt at exclusiveness by an ancient right of the holders of high office to erect wax death masks . This made their personalities and families more widely known , and even more awesome when a whole series of death masks of ancestral officeholders could be arranged in the order of a family tree . The familiarity of a family , by virtue of its public images , conferred advantage in public elections ( Hammond and Scullard 1970 ; Wiseman : 971 ) . Insofar as nobiles and senators prevented the admission of newcomers to their status , the system was closed ; insofar as new men got in , it was open . Historians differ in their assessment of this , some stressing closure , others openness ( sec : e.g. , Hammond and Scullard 1970 ; Rawson 1975 ;  | Stockton 1971 ) . Time and place , as we shall see , were important determinants of openness and closure . A factor that may have promoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's highest families not to reproduce themselves , a tendency manifest over a considerable period ( Frank 1916 ; Gelzer 1912 1969 ; Hopkins 1974 ; Weaver 1974 ) . It is also important to note that senators could be demoted because of bankruptcy , or even relative impoverishment ( Wiseman 1971 ) . Another important factor in openness at the top of Roman society was the rise of the equestrian order ( Henderson 1963 ; Hill 1952 ) , which as the name suggests , developed out of the ancient Roman cavalry . Entry into the cavalry required a set standard of wealth . Of those who qualified , a relatively small number were chosen for the honor of receiving a horse at the state 's expense . In the latter half of the second century B.C. , in the course of an attempt to reassert the power of popular assemblies over the senate , senators were banned from entry into the equestrian order ( Wiseman 1971 ) . This effectively pitted equites against senators ( Gelzer 1969 ; Hill 1952 ) . In the widest sense , the equestrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those with public horse ) but also all retired equestrians and all persons legally qualified by wealth and citizenship status to be equestrians ( Garnsey 1970 ) . The equestrians in this broad sense must have been conscious of their distinction from the mass of Romans , as well as from the senators , well before the middle of the second century B.C. ( Hill 1952 ) . Since senators were in theory banned from commerce and finance , which would have demeaned their status , the equestrians predominated in these fields , made so lucrative as a result of the Punic Wars . Having the profits of office and great landholdings , senators were of course far from impoverished , but the equites were in a good position to become wealthy , and they did ( Gelzer 1969 ; Hill 1952 ) . With their wealth the equites were in turn in good position to assail senatorial status . Wiseman ( 1971 ) and Syme ( 19391 1979 ) both show that the equites did so with considerable success . Insofar as there was a middle class apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to be conscious of itself as a class ( MacMullen 197494 ) . Little is known about the common man in Rome , but mobility was possible for him , more so in urban settings and in the east of the empire ( MacMullen 1974 ) At the bottom of the Roman social pyramid were the slaves . As in most of Greece , in Rome slavery was undeniably an important institution . Yet  | slaves never constituted a majority ( Hopkins 1978 ) . " Public opinion in Rome , " Treggiari notes , " accepted the freeing of slaves as normal and even desirable " ( 1969:12 ) . This was not because the Romans questioned the concept of slavery but because they recognized individual merit ( Treggiari 1969 ) . All authorities attest to very high rates of manumission , at least of urban slaves ( Frank 1916 ; Hammond and Scullard 1970 ; Hopkins 1978 ; Symes 1939 1979 ) . Freed slaves had better opportunities " to rise in the world than the freeborn poor " ( MacMullen 1974:124 ) . If manumitted by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizenship ( Hopkins 1978 ; Treggiari 1969 ) . Slaves and freedmen were prominent in trade , the professions , and in small industry ( Hill 1952 ; Treggiari 1969 ) , generally serving in all occupations in which ordinary Roman citizens were to be found ( Hammond and Scullard 1970 ; Treggiari 1969 ) . Slaves lost the ethnic , kinship , and religious ties that they possessed prior to enslavement and were identified with the household and society of their masters ( Hammond and Scullard 1970 ) . Freedmen suffered a variety of legal disabilities , but a freedman 's son was essentially free from the bonds that held his father ( Garnsey 1970 ; Gelzer 1969 ; Hopkins 1978 ; Treggiari 1969 ) . Some freedmen became very wealthy , and in the early imperial period some of the imperial freedmen , who formed the embryonic imperial bureaucracy , became not only extremely wealthy but no less powerful ( Hammond and Scullard 1970 ; Hopkins 1974 , 1978 ; Weaver 1974 ) . The pattern of entrusting to freedmen some of the most powerful and lucrative posts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare for freedmen to become equestrians and even rarer for former slaves to become senators , but both occurred ( Weaver 1974 ; Wiseman 1971 ) . As early as 312 B.C. the censor Appius Claudius attempted to have the sons of freedmen admitted to the Senate ( Treggiari 1969 ; Wiseman 1971 ) , but it was long resisted . Eventually the precedent was set , yet the entry of sons and grandsons of freedmen , let alone the freedmen themselves , always raised eyebrows ( Hammond and Scullard 1970 ) . Treggiari ( 1969 ) argues that in the republic there was neither a legal barrier to admitting the sons of freedmen to the Senate nor even conclusive evidence that freedmen were ineligible to enter the Senate ; however , custom was against both . Freedmen were legally barred from the equestrian order , but their sons were not , and sons of freedmen achieved equestrian rank in considerable numbers ( Wiseman 1971 ) . Roman citizenship was progressively expanded , not only to include  | specially honored individuals ( Wiseman 1971 ) and manumitted slaves ( Hopkins 1978 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of particular communities or regions in Italy and the empire . From 91 to 88 B.C. the so-called Social War was fought between Rome and her Italian allies ( socii ) , at the conclusion of which many of the socii were granted citizenship . The fact that 900,000 citizens were registered in 70 B.C. and 4,000,000 in 28 B.C. well illustrates the rapidity with which citizenship was expanded ( Wiseman 1971 ) . The grandsons of the newly enfranchised not uncommonly achieved senatorial rank ( Wiseman 1971 ) . By A.D. 212 all Roman subjects had been granted citizenship . The conditions of slavery and of citizenship led to an astonishing feat of acculturation , spreading the Latin language , Roman institutions , and the sense of being a Roman far beyond the Roman homeland and also drawing hordes of once-foreign peoples laterally into and vertically up through the ranks of Roman society ( Frank 1916 ; Gordon 1924 ; Hammond and Scullard 1970 ; Hopkins 1974 ; Treggiari 1969 ) . While all the statuses described above ? patrician , plebian , consul , senator , equestrian , freeborn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the republican into the imperial period , some of their most important interrelationships were transformed in the process . Two thorough investigations of the subject are Ronald Syme 's qualitative analysis of The Roman Revolution ( 19391 1979 ) and T. P. Wiseman 's quantitative study of the New Men in the Roman Senate , 139 B.C. ? AD. 14 ( 1971 ) . Both show that it was a period of unprecedented and explosive social mobility . In the course of the Roman revolution the nobiles were decimated by the Civil Wars and by proscriptions in which their property was redistributed . Trustworthy men , notably military figures , rose to high office regardless of their background , though they might quickly fall when their patrons toppled one another . Senatorial rank became heritable , within limits , but the Senate was degraded by alternately packing it with newcomers and purging it . Patrician status was conferred by fiat , and citizenship was greatly expanded . Rome became a true plutocracy , and wealthy nonRoman Italians or provincials increasingly entered the highest Roman strata . Imperial freedmen grew rich and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become emperors ( Syme 19391 1979 ) . Wiseman ( 1971 ) identified 563 novi senators and 52 novi consuls between 139 B.C. and A.D. 14 , with the sharpest increases occurring during and immediately after the period of the Triumvirs , who succeeded Julius Caesar in 44 B.C. By contrast , only ten novi held thirteen consulships in the 227 years before 139 B.C. ( Geizer 1912 1969 ) .  | Treggiari thought that the transitional period between the republic and the empire " provided more opportunities than ever before for ability , or unscrupulousness , to assert itself against mere right of birth " and that there was an " explosive rise to power of . . . moneyed classes outside the Senate in the late Republic " ( 1969:162 , 244 ) . Central to this mobility was the rise and fall of competing dictators and ultimately the emperors : they sought talented and powerful supporters where they could find them , and ambitious men could further their own goals by supporting the competitors at the top . Once the emperors were established , they sought policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overthrown . To this end the emperors constructed a bureaucracy composed of equestrians , on the one hand , and freedmen and slaves , on the other ( Arnheim 1972 ; Weaver 1974 ) . From the beginning of the empire , the emperors strove to appoint fewer and fewer senators to high office , culminating in the reign of Diocletian ( A.D. 284-305 ) , who turned the set of offices open to senators into a cul-de-sac ( Arnheim 1972 ) . At the same time as senatorial access to office was restricted , it became easier to enter the Senate , which further degraded it ( Arnheim 1972 ) . By the end of the first century A.D. 2,3 percent of the senators were of provincial origin and hence presumably not of old senatorial family . By the middle of the second century the figure had risen to 42 percent , and by the third century it was 56 ( Hopkins 1974 ) . Social mobility in the republican and early imperial periods was not without ideological support . The mobility and its ideology can often be found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , born of peasant stock , was unequivocally a new man , and an eloquent spokesman for the claims of merit over birth ( Hammond and Scullard 1970 ; Syme 1958 ; but cf. Gelzer 1912 1969 , who considered Cato to have been born to equestrian status ) . Cato rhetorically idealized a plebian war hero who served as consul four times and was credited with " humble birth , incorruptibility , and frugality " ( Hammond and Scullard 1970:332 ) . Lucius Coelius Antipater was not a senator ( Martin 1981 ) . Lieinius Macer as a politician defended the people 's rights against " self-seeking nobles " by reasserting t he authority of tribunes ( plebian offices ) and advising the people to refuse military service until their demands were met ( Martin 1981:18 ; Thompson 1942:I ) . Marcus Aemilius Scaurus , the first to write an autobiography , was of modest beginnings ( Radian 1966 ) . Sallust was a novus homo , though he must have come from a locally prominent family . He was critical of the nobiles and their exclusiveness but also of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the speeches in his histories were vehicles for  | attack on the nobiles ( Martin 1981 ; McDonald 1954 ; Paul 1966 ; Syme 1939 1979 ) Cicero , though not formally a historian , deserves to be considered along with them for the reasons given above . Born a provincial but of equestrian status , he strove from early life to excel . Through good education , military service , patronage of the powerful , a marriage above his station , and above all his forensic eloquence , he achieved the consulate ( Boissier n.d. ; McKeon 1950 ; Rawson 1975 ; Stockton 1971 ) . Cicero is undoubtedly the most famous of the novi homines and is our main source for the ideology of the new man ( Wiseman 1971 ) . His barbs at noble privilege are famous , perhaps the best known being his remark " about those fortunate people who do not need to have any merit , who do not require to take trouble , and to whom the highest places in the republic come while they are sleeping " ( Boissier n.d.:29 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one who was twice consul and whose " poverty , austerity , and incorruptibility " were legendary ( Hammond and Scullard 1970:428 ) . While he was no democrat and made little effort to actually help new men ( Boissier n.d. ; Stockton 1971 ; Syme 1939 1979 ) , Cicero has had considerable influence into modern times as a spokesman for men of talent in their opposition to the privileges of birth ( Rawson 1975 ) . The theme of social mobility is consistently detectable in the lives or writings of the Roman historians , whether new men or not . Thus Julius Caesar was a patrician and " proud of it , " but he earned his position by merit , had a keen eye for it , and his dictatorship " meant ... promotion for merit " ( Syme 1939 1979:94 ) . Livy was not a senator and may have been a stoic ( Walsh 1966 ) . Moreover , one of the two major themes of his work was " the domestic struggles out of which the plebs won an honourable role in government " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech in A. D. 48 in which he spoke on behalf of granting to certain Roman citizens the right to seek senatorial office and outlined a history of the advancement of the meritorious that stretched all the way back to the period of the Roman kings ( Martin 1981 ; Wiseman 1971 ) . He was a bitter enemy of the nobiles ( Syme 1939 1979 ) . Valerius Maximus , one of the lesser antiquarians of the early imperial period , gathered materials under the heading of " men of obscure birth who became famous " ( Thompson 1942:I , 81 ) . Tacitus 's origins are obscure , but he " was neither aristocrat nor Roman born " ( Martin 1981 : 24 ? 25 ; Syme 1958:II ) . Martin ( 1981 ) thought that the period in which Tacitus lived provided considerable scope for mobility .  | Martin ( 1981:41 ? 42 ) also argued that by emulating Cato , through Sallust , Tacitus indicates " an allegiance in thought to Cato , who had sought to champion the view that political advancement should be won by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In a speech to his troops by the emperor Otho ( r . A.D. 69 ) , Tacitus succinctly sets forth a view of Roman mobility : " For as senators come from your ranks , so do emperors come from the ranks of senators " ( quoted in Martin 1981:77 ) . The care with which Tacitus reported the speech by Claudius recommending meritocratic appointment suggests more than casual interest in the matter ( Martin 1981 ) . Atticus and Suetonius were sons of equestrians ( Hammond and Scullard 1970 ) . As noted earlier , Trogus Pompeius was a Gaul , Ammianus Marccllinus a Greek . Eusebius was from Palestine . St. Augustine was from a " poor family , " and like many of the other church fathers he had made his way to eminence from the " obscure towns " of the empire ( Brown 1971:30 , 33 ) . He advocated faith and conduct above birth ( Murray 1978 ) . With some exceptions , then , the Roman historians show a significant tendency to be new men and to be members of a class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Syme 1979 ) . There are other indictions of a meritocratic ideology . Stoicism ? with its belief that all mankind are essentially similar ( Hopkins 1978 ) and " that slaves could be the moral equals of their masters " ( Treggiari 1969:12 ) ? was influential for a period in Rome , though mostly at the upper levels of society . A populist ideology stressing merit over birth was espoused in the latter half of the second century B.C. when the Gracchi brothers led an attempt to reassert the authority of popular assemblies . ( McDonald 1954 thought that this period , which saw the publication of the pontifical annals , reminded people of the Struggle of the Orders and stimulated an interest in history . ) However , populism was a force in politics for only a half century ; no democratic or egalitarian ethos ever took root in Rome ( lHmmond and Scullard 1970 ; Syme 1939 1979 ) . At all times the consciousness of rank was as salient as occupation is in the modern West , and the climb up the social pyramid was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But with the opportunity to change one 's rank , this consciousness was an incentive to action ( Syme 1958 ) . The theoretical openness of the Roman system ? even the office of emperor was not in principle hereditary ? may have been an important part of the popular conception of Rome , a conception perhaps deliberately fostered to maintain popular consensus . On the other hand , there were hereditarian strains too , one example bring the lingering prestige and ritual offices of the patricians . The con- sistent ease with which persons of distinguished lineage won office in the republic lends weight to arguments that the people preferred the rule of the highborn , that is , that there was some sort of popular ideology of inherent nobility . The evidence for this , however , is only circumstantial ( Gelzer 1912 1969 ) . Arnheim ( 1972:75 ) says that in the imperial period the hereditary ideal of the succession of emperors was " always dear to the troops . " Julius Caesar claimed divine descent , but he was the first to do so ( Hopkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a hereditarian ideology in Rome by A.D. 300 and yet also notes an " undercurrent of an ideology that ability should be rewarded " ( 1974:111 ) . Martin ( 1981 ) makes the intriguing observation that the Romans considered character to be immutable . His example is Tacitus 's showing how the emperor Tiberius slowly unmasked his true personality as the restraints on it fell in the course of his life . This notion seems to fit the tendency in Rome for social mobility not to be accepted in one person 's lifetime but to be normal across the generations . Perhaps Romans thought character was formed at birth , hence their great interest in astrology ( Hopkins 1978 ) ; or early in life , hence their interest in education , generally in a familial setting ( Gwynn 1926 ; Rawson 1975 ) . I have so far concentrated on stratification in the republic and early empire ; what was the situation in the late empire ? First we should note that certain traditional forms of mobility disappeared in the late empire . Mobility provided by admission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when all subjects became citizens . About a century later , mobility out of slave and into free status came to an end , after a long period of slow decline , when the condition of servitude in the classical sense fell into disuse . At about the same time , the middle class , either in the sense of the equestrian order or in the sense of a bourgeoisie , also ceased to exist ( MacMullen 1964 ) . Some historians judge the Late Roman Empire to have actually been caste-organized . An example is Ferdinand Lot in his The End of the Ancient World and the Beginnings of the Middle Ages ( 1937 1961 ) . During the reigns of Diocletian ( r. 284-305 ) , Constantine ( r. 306-337 ) , and their immediate successors , and in the face of severe economic difficulties , " the State saw only one way of salvation ; to bind every man by force to his occupation , to chain him and his descendants to the same post , and it established a real caste system " ( Lot 1937 1961:84 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of caste legislation in the late empire as follows . At first , certain military posts were made hereditary .  | As a result of a shortage of specie , work in some mines became first compulsory , then hereditary . Similarly , workers in the mints pursued their craft for life , and it was made hereditary ; moreover , their children could not marry out of their hereditary craft group . Imperial armorers , smiths , muleteers , grooms , cartwrights , veterinary surgeons , postmen , weavers , and others , were similarly organized . Major aspects of maritime commerce were made hereditary occupations . Even gladiators , mimes , musicians , charioteers , actors , and actresses were " hereditarily chained to their professions . " Eventually , large segments of the military could only be entered by persons meeting certain hereditary qualifications , and once in these occupations their status was inherited . According to Lot , who quotes E. Garsonnet , Constantine issued the laws that bound agricultural workers , coloni , to their estates : " The colonus .. is a perpetual and hereditary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soil is both a right and an obligation ; he can not be given public duties which will take him away from it , nor ordained as a cleric , unless it be on the land he cultivates and on condition that he remain on it " ( Garsonnet , quoted in Lot 19i7 1961:108 ; see also Jones 1974 ) . At first it was only long-term coloni who were to be affected by these laws , but Valentinian I ( r. 364 ? 375 ) made the law apply to all : " We to not deem that coloni have liberty to leave the land to which their condition and birth attach them . If they go away f r o m it ... let them be brought back , put into chains and punished " ( quoted in Lot 1937 1961:111 ) . Ultimately , even the free man who worked for another for thirty years was reduced to the status of colonus , a position inherited by his children . Coloni could only marry coloni . Lot ( 1961:112 ) describes the law as more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonate outlived the Roman Empire by " a considerable number of centuries . " Moreover , those free peasants not regarded is coloni but grouped in independent villages were also bound to the soil , becoming " the serfs of their village " ( 1937 1961:113-14 ) . At the same time , agricultural slaves were converted to serfs by legislation that forbade their sale except with the land they worked ( Jones 1956 , 1974 ) . Further , not only the lower strata of society were converted into castes . The curiales , the upper- and middle-class elements of Roman municipalities , were also bound to their position hereditarily . They were forbidden to pass into the provincia1 senatorial order , and in A.D. 320 the curiales even lost the ability to become clerics ( Lot 119371 1961 ; sec also Hammond and Scullard 1970 ) . The result of these changes was " the arrangement of society into orders '  | or closed classes that brought almost to a complete standstill the upward movement from class to class which quickens modern socities " ( Lot 1937 1961:124-25 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical writing declined " ( 1937 1961:152 ; see also Hollister 1966 ) . Although it is not clear from Lot 's account who could have entered it , the senatorial order remained theoretically open . A recent work ( Arnheim 1972 ) throws light on the extent to which it was open . Arnheim argues that the emperors pursued a policy , culminating in Diocletian 's reign , of curbing the power of the Senate as a body and senators as individuals . Constantine reversed this policy and appointed substantial numbers of senators to high office ( Arnheim 1972 ) . To be sure , the Senate remained a hollow institution , but the senatorial order was reinvigorated by Constantine 's policy , a policy continued by all his successors in the West ( Arnheim 1972 ) . Arnheim is less concerned with senators per se ? for some achieved that office anew , especially in the eastern empire ? than he is with them as a landed nobility in the hereditary sense ( 1972 ) . Arnheim speculates that since the landed nobility had remained cohesive and powerful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successors decided it would be more convenient to woo the nobility than to continue to fight it ( 1972 ) . Peter Brown ( 1971:332 ) calls Constantine the " restorer of the Senate " and says that his policy contributed to the development of a nobility in the western empire . The nobles flourished under these conditions , so that within 150 years the hereditary nobility had important claims to high governmental and ecclesiastical office in spite of the emperor 's theoretical right to appoint whomever he would ( Arnheim 1972 ) . The estates of the nobles tended to become economically and socially self-contained . They also tended to be fortified , the larger ones resembling towns . Owners spent more and more time on their estates . The master 's power over his coloni was great , and by 365 the distinction between colonus and slave had largely dissolved ( Arnheim 1972 ) . Arnheim shows that there was mobility to high places : both Diocletian and Valentinian ( r. 364-375 ) , for example , were of humble origin . But , as noted earlier , Arnheim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empire . Pride of lineage was strong , and the lower orders respected the nobles in the fourth century ( Arnheim 1972 ) . Nobles continued to he held in esteem under the Germanic invaders of the western empire ( Arnhcim 1972 ; see also Jones 1964:II ) . Like IAA , Arnheim sees an essential continuity between the conditions of the late empire and medieval Europe : The  | German invasions of Rome " strengthened the underlying amalgam of economic , social , and political forces in society , centrifugal in tendency and aristocratic in tone , which had been prominent since the reign of Constantine and which were to continue to dominate Western Europe for close on a thousand years " ( 1972:171 ) . It should be observed that Arnheim stresses the lesser role of nobility in the eastern empire , and hence the greater scope for social mobility there . Among the recent historians who still talk of caste in late Roman history is MacMullen ( 1974 ) . He notes a five-century trend of increasing concentration of landholding in the Empire and its effect on social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caste , at least in the late Empire " ( 1974:126 ) . But some historians have challenged the view that the social structure of late antiquity was castelike . Examining the writings of Ausonius , a professor at Bordeaux in the middle of the fourth century , Hopkins ( 1961 ) , for example , provides convincing evidence that the professors or teachers of Bordeaux were not in fact a hereditarily defined group . In a later paper Hopkins ( 1974 ; see also Jones 1964:II ) argues that social mobility may actually have reached its peak in Rome in the fourth century , the many laws prohibiting social mobility actually being evidence that it was perceived as a persistent problem . This is a radical reassessment of what the caste legislation was all about and what its effects may have been . Unfortunately , as Hopkins ( 1974 ) concedes , quantitative data on mobility are scanty , and the evidence on entry into the Senate by provincials that Hopkins provides indicates that the highest rate was in the second century . What Hopkins does show is a fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admission of provincials was a slow process of the climb of families over generations , he adds that " this gradual mobility existed unsupported by any major ideology of advancement . " " There are occasional statements that praise ability rather than birth , but the dominant ideology praised aristocratic birth , blood and nature above all else " ( Hopkins 1974:117 ) . ' fiis , although Hopkins has shown that late imperial Roman society was not wholly closed , his argument that social mobility may have peaked in the fourth century A.D. is not demonstrated . What he says about the ideology of social mobility suggests that it was more hereditarian in the fiurth century than it had been in the days of Cicero , Sallust , and Tacitus . Alfiildi ( 1952 ) says that in the time of Valentinian I ( 321 ? ? 375 ) new aplx ) intees to senatorial rank , largely from the military , outnumbered those who acquired the status by birth . This suggests much mobility , but the  | relative proportions at Rome , as opposed to Constantinople , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution of these disparate views of social stratification in the late empire lies at least in part in the differing conditions of eastern and western empires . Consider Peter Brown 's The World of Late Antiquity , AD 150 ? 750 ( 1971 ) . Brown repeatedly stresses the social mobility and creativity of the late empire , speaking of " exceptionally open " stratification and a galaxy of self-made men who either became emperors or who produced a vigorous Latin literature that was largely associated with the Church ( 1971:36 , 38 ) . But Brown just as often notes that these developments are more associated with the eastern empire ; the western empire was closing down . " By the fifth century , " he notes , " the wealth of the West had snowballed into the hands of a few great families . . . . In the East there was . . . a more balanced , even a more egalitarian society " and that " the peasants of Roman Asia Minor , Syria and Egypt were very different from the dragooned and excluded serfs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trade was more vibrant in the East , and Constantinople ? the " goal of gifted provincials " ? was more centralized yet a " whirlpool of change " ( P. Brown 1971:28 , 141 ) . Brown is not alone in this view ; MacMullen contends that in the imperial period " the preponderance of the empire 's wealth in the Roman homeland ... concentrated into the hands of a narrowing nobility , " and social mobility " becomes far more the rule than the exception as one moves eastward " in the empire ( 197491 , 101 ) . The Church , " professedly egalitarian , " was , Brown says , " the most flexible and open group , " " made most headway in just those areas where Roman society was most fluid , " and thus flourished more in the East ( 1971:65 , 66 , 88 ) . In the fifth-century West , by contrast , " a double oligarchy of senators and clergymen ? now closely interrelated ? maintained the splendid isolation of the city of Rome " ( P. Brown 1971:131 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a closed elite " whose " senator-bishops towered above an increasingly passive and uncultivated laity " ( P. Brown 1971:148 ) . The monastic order in the West was also " captured by a .. . narrow . . . section of the aristocracy " ( P. Brown 1971:109 ) . Finally , there is reason to think that from the time Constantinople was made the co-capital ( A.D. 330 ) there was a legally more open society there than in Rome . For example , in the Theodosian Code , which was issued in 438 but which covers Roman legislation back to A.D. 312 , it is readily apparent that much of the caste legislation was specifically designated to apply to the guilds of the city of Rome ( Pharr 1952 ) . Although the legislation  | was published in the names of both eastern and western co-rulers , the laws did not necessarily apply to all parts of the empire . By the end of the fourth century , urban craftsmen were tied to their trades in the West , but they were never , or only rarely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Jones 1964 ; Ostrogorsky 1957 ) . Concomitants In chapter 2 , I quoted Dumezil ( 1970 ) on the contrast between India and Rome , crediting the Romans for thinking historically , practically , empirically , politically , and juridically . Cicero illustrates one of the high points , marking an advance even on Greek political science ( McKeon 1950:53 ) . McKeon notes that in his Republic Cicero employs three great strands of political theory which have continued to be influential : ... ( 1 ) a dynamic evolutionary conception of the state ; ( 2 ) a treatment of political doctrines and actions in terms of conflicts of interests of groups and individuals and in terms of their duties ; and ( 3 ) an analysis of the application and enforcement of law conceived as the source of virtue and happiness . ( 1950:54 ) Cicero also contributed to the functional analysis of political myths ( McKeon 195o ) . In his De Divinatione he defends state augury for its contribution to religion and hence to the stability of the state , even though he exposes state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , is functional analysis . The working of the republic as a system emerged with considerable clarity in Cicero 's voluminous writings ( the rediscovery of which was to be of great import in the Renaissance ( Rawson 1975 ) . Cicero was not alone in his basically secular , humanistic mode of thinking . Dumezil points out that " the Romans very early isolated the idea of persona , and it is on this idea , on the autonomy , the stability , and the dignity of persons , that they constructed their ideal of human relations- with the gods intervening only as witnesses and guarantors . India on the other hand persuaded itself more and more that individuals are only deceptive appearances . " ( 1970:117 ) . The idea of the persona is a key clement in modern comparative social science ( Krader 1968 ) . The surest signs of the individualism that Dumezil sees in Rome , as compared to India , arc to he found in Roman biography , autobiography , and realistic portraiture . Biography and autobiography were discussed her . Roman portraiture probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high ranking Romans . Originally they were not realistic , but in the  | second century B.C. , and under the influence of Greek patterns , they became so ( Breckenridge 1968 ) . Eventually they became extremely realistic , " as far removed as possible from the generalized and the typical " ( Breckenridge 1968:143 ) As in Greece , Breckenridge ( 1968 ) sees in Rome , too , a connection between the individualism fostered by materialistic philosophies and realistic art ? which in Rome , and only slightly less so in Greece , became the predominant form of sculpture , produced for common citizens as well as heroes . In the second century B.C. , Epicureanism , which Breckenridge ( 1968:182 ) describes as " the farthest extreme of Greek Humanism , " was brought to Rome , where Lucretius became " its most eloquent spokesman . " Epicurus 's doctrines were " uncompromisingly individualistic " ( Breckenridge 1968:181 ) . Stoicism was also strongly individualistic , and like Epicureanism it held that " all we can know is to be found in the world of the senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materialistic views ? he aimed " to rid the world of superstition " ( Shotwell 1923:220 ) ? Breckenridge ( 1968:185 ) says that " a naturalistic art would seem almost an inevitable concomitant . " Biography developed along with portraiture , so that " toward the end of Cicero 's life , " Rawson observes , when " portrait sculpture in Rome reached a new level of vividness and psychological penetration , we know the faces as well as the minds of some of the prominent men of the time " ( 1975:xiii ) . Cicero also illustrates a conception of mankind that fits the picture of Rome as an open society with a sound sense of history . In his survey of Greek philosophy he noted that all schools agreed on the common nature of mankind ( McKeon 1950 ) , a view with which he seemed to agree , having " written ... that all nations are only one and the same family " ( quoted in Boissier n.d.:55 ) . Tacitus explicitly rejected the idea that senators ( or equestrians ) differed by nature from other men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of leading Romans , held that human nature is essentially the same everywhere . We might also note the connection between Stoic ideas and the development of the idea of natural law in Rome 's ius gentium , the law of nations , which rests upon notions of right and wrong common to the human mind . The Stoics were also greatly concerned with divination ( McKeon 1950 ) . While Cicero attempted to debunk divination , the attention he gave it illustrates its importance in Rome . Hopkins concludes that " among the Roman elite astrology was a major intellectual pursuit , a preoccupation  | which , like economics nowadays , coloured serious political behaviour " ( 1978:233-34 ) . " The credit of omens and astrology grew steadily " in the revolutionary period , and when in the early empire , astrologers were expelled from Rome , it was so the rulers might " monopolize the control of prophecy " ( Syme 1939 1979:256 ; McKeon 1950 ) . Interpreting auguries was a topic of antiquarian studies that flourished in the late republic ( Shotwell 1923:236 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulted astrologers in hope of finding an inheritance in his future , much as nowadays he would pin his hopes on a lottery ticket ( MacMullen 1974 ) On the legitimate side of science , Roman achievements were less spectacular than those of the Greeks but were substantial nonetheless ( Edelstein 1963 ) . One of the high points is surely Lucretius 's The Nature of the Universe , written in about 55 B.C. It presents a secular view of the universe , its origins , and evolution . Lucretius 's discussion in book 5 of the evolution of human society and culture not only expresses an important philosophy of history but was also remarkably prescient ( Shotwell 1923 ) . Rawson ( 1975 ) says that the Greeks and Romans were very concerned with education , but at present I find it difficult to show that the Romans were peculiar in this regard . In other respects , however , the Romans of the late republican through the early imperial periods show quite unmistakably the full syndrome of concomitants of the open society . In the late empire some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the Platonic tradition in the East maintained the interest in politics , in the West it went " otherworldly and mystical " ( P. Brown 1971:139 ) , this in spite of the fact that Christianity took root quicker in the East . Peter Brown ( 1971 ) thinks that the bishop-scholars in the West by the sixth century had gotten " too busy " to maintain classical civilization , though they were not too busy , he notes , to engage in considerable forgery or show more interest in relics than in men . Portraiture , however , seems to have shifted to iconography more or less at the same time in both East and West : " from Constantine onwards , there is no longer anything which has any worth : there are only lifeless images in the Oriental frontal style " ( Lot 1961:138 ; see also P. Brown 1971 ; Hoxie 1966 ; Ullmann 19666 ) . Berenson , who traces the decline of realistic portraiture during the lifetime of Constantine , wonders if the artists had not suddenly deserted Rome , " leaving mere artisans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may note two comparisons . First , in comparing the Romans with the Greeks , Roman historiography , excellent though it was , is sometimes considered to have been inferior to Greek historiography ( Barnes 1937 ; Shotwell 1923 ; Thompson 1942:I ) . Correlatively , there is a somewhat lesser commitment to openness in Roman society in many periods . More important , however , and more convincing , are comparisons within the Roman tradition . As I understand the original distinction between patricians and plebs , early republican Rome was closed . By the time the plebs achieved the last of their political goals , in 287 B.C. , Roman society was open . Before the third century was over , Rome 's successes in the Punic Wars were to provide vast scope for upward mobility , and Fabius Pictor began the Roman historiographic tradition shortly thereafter . Even more striking is the relationship between the flowering of Roman historiography ? between the times of Sallust and Tacitus ? and the dramatic increase in social mobility during the period of republican collapse and the emergence of the empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as noted above , at least two historians ( McDonald 1954 ; Syme 1939 1979 ) saw a connection . Syme puts it most explicitly in his discussion of the decade that saw the most explosive mobility at the top : " In Rome of the triumvirs men became intensely conscious of history " ( 1939 1979:250 ) . Assessments differ on social mobility in late imperial Rome , but there is substantial agreement that the East and the Church were relatively more open and that the quality of their historiography was superior too . Nearly all the concomitants conform to expectations in the late republican and early imperial periods , but some anomalies appear in the late empire . While the Greek and Roman cases presented above provide rather strong evidence to support my arguments , the earlier Near Eastern cases are more equivocal . Factors in addition to social stratification seem to have been significantly at play . Some of these factors , especially primitiveness and scale , should be noted . It would be wrong to equate the open society with civilization and the closed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open society can only really flourish under civilized conditions . Primitiveness may account for some of the findings in this chapter . Thus , whereas Assyria , Babylonia , and ancient Israel came closer to manifesting the open society syndrome than did late Egypt , they did not manifest it as much as did classical Greece and classical Rome . Presumably it took time to develop the social sciences , for example . The Greeks and Romans reached that level , but the Mesopotamians and Hebrews did not . The " wisdom literature " of the Mesopotamians suggests , however faintly , that they had an interest in the secular , objective analysis of social affairs , but such humble beginnings may have been no less apparent among the Egyptians . Conditions in ancient Israel may also partly reflect primitiveness , but three other factors are relevant too . One is scale : compared to Babylonia and Assyria , ancient Israel was a small-scale society . This could hinder some developments , but there is no strong reason to think it was decisive ? classical Greeks lived in relatively small societies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a brief period , its people usually existing as minorities in other political entities . This is a difficult factor to assess . Third is the equivocal nature of stratification in Israel . The society was basically open , but for a time it had a hereditary priesthood , and its doctrine of the " chosen people " is partly hereditarian . For reasons to be discussed in the last chapter , I do not think a racial or semiracial doctrine that separates the members of a society from the rest of humanity is a decisive breach of the concept of human nature as uniform , which appears to be a correlate of openness . But my reasons for thinking this apply with more force to large-scale societies , such as China , than to small-scale ones embedded in larger civilizations , such as was the case with ancient Israel . For whatever reason , ancient Israel , and perhaps Egypt before ' Too B.C. , least conform to expectations . But all cases summarized in this chapter show contrasts in the appropriate direction , and almost all show more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examines the relationship between social stratification , historiography , and other concomitants among four approximately coeval civilizations in Europe and the Near East . Two , medieval Europe and Byzantium , developed from common seed in the Roman Empire ; the other two , Sassanid Persia and the classical Islamic world , stood approximately as predecessor and successor in the same region . The Renaissance view of the Middle Ages as a period of abysmal decline , a Dark Age , has long been challenged . Nonetheless , there are those who see in the period , particularly in earlier centuries , a general decline in historiographic quality ; others see a leveling off , a plateau , in the otherwise progressive trend of historiographic development in the West . No one says the Middle Ages in Europe were historiographically superior to earlier and later traditions . For example , Thompson ( 1942:I ) , himself a medievalist , in his several chapters on medieval historiography makes no overall judgment . Yet when he turns to Byzantine historians , he states flatly that " in the early centuries of the Middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those of the West " ( 1942:I , 295 ) . Vryonis ( 1968:1 ) , who compares medieval historiography in the West , Byzantium , and the Islamic world , says that historiography in the West deteriorated after the second century A.D. and " remained inferior until the Renaissance . " Shotwell ( 1923:286 ) considered the revolution in thought that marked the beginning of the medieval period to be a " calamity for historiography . " Hollister ( 1966:179 ) describes the fifth to the ninth centuries in the West as a " twilight " in which the historical record is " unquestionably dim . " Russell ( 1954a:49 ) called the historiographic tradition of the twelfth century " jejune , " even though some individuals rose above it . Sanford ( 1944 ) argues t hat medieval standards did not seriously decline from the high standards of antiquity but did not improve , either . In his study of the Renaissance sense of history , Burke ( 1969:1 ) says that the sense of history " was lacking in the Middle Ages . " Setting forth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) says that the scope of medieval histories tended to be limited only by creation and the Last Judgment , and that medieval historians treated individuals as " passive spectators rather than active agents , " considered secular affairs important only as they reflected divine affairs , and could see connections between events only if explicable in the words of prophets . Cochrane avoids judging these characteristics , and perhaps they were not necessarily detrimental , but in practice they ' generally were . Spiegel ( 1983:43 ? 44 ) gives a concise list of the " errors " of which medieval historiography stands accused , and does not attempt " entirely to dispel " them . Among the characteristics of medieval historiography are the following : an undue concern with myth , forgery , and fabulous genealogy ; an uncertain ' grasp of the distinction between real and ideal , combined with some problems in reasoning or in understanding causation ; almost exclusively religious authorship ; a strong tendency for the individual to be effaced , both as subject and author ; a tendency to ignore or distort the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion of anachronism . These and a few less important characteristics are worth discussing before we examine specific historians . It is important to realize that men of the medieval period did not lose all interest in the past . But the sources available to them , as Marc Bloch pointed out , were " more copious than exact , . . . forgery and myth-making . were exceptionally flourishing , . . . and people came to reconstruct ( the past ) as they considered it ought to have been " ( 1961:I , 90-92 ) .  | Genealogical matters were particularly prone to historical falsification or fabrication . Without attaching any sociological significance to it , Sanford ( 1944:4o ) , for example , notes that in the Middle Ages " Frankish and Flemish nobles . . . traced their descent from Priam , Adam , or both . " Bloch ( 1961:II , 284 ) adds , " The most striking feature of the history of the dominant families in the first feudal age is the shortness of their pedigrees ? at least if we agree to reject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Those fables should not be rejected , however , because they do form part of the medieval view of the past ( Spiegel 1983 ) and because they provide crucial evidence as to why European society in the Middle Ages was not historically minded . If it was the dominant families who promulgated fabulous accounts of their past , surely it is no mystery that the historian had little incentive to correct those accounts . Later I will try to show that the forgery and mythmaking were closely linked to the structure of society in the Middle Ages . This is not a novel idea . In medieval historiography , Heinrich von Sybel observed , No distinction was made between ideal and real . . . . Heroic poems were considered a true and lofty form of history and history was everywhere displaced by epics , legends or poetical fiction of some kind .... Almost no one felt any scruples in giving to existing conditions the sanction of venerable age by means of fabricated history or forged documents . The question whether the ascribed derivation was true interested no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights , dominating interests and prevalent beliefs . ( Quoted in Barnes 1937:56 ) For the moment it will suffice to mention perhaps the most famous medieval forgery , the Donation of Constantine . This document was fundamental to the positions of both pope and emperor in medieval Europe , and also to the status of the clergy . The exposure of the document as a forgery during the Renaissance was one of the key exercises in critical history that marked the shift from medieval to Renaissance historiography . By showing that the meanings of words and the character of institutions changed with time , the Renaissance introduced the idea of historicism . Prior to the development of this revolutionary idea , European historians tended to see the past largely in their own unreflective terms . Thus " . i serious deficiency of much of medieval historical writing was the absence of historical sense ; . . . anachronisms abounded " ( Russell 1954a:44 ) . Though sponsored by reigning families as well as monastic houses ( Russell 1954a ) , nearly all medieval literature was written by churchmen and strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor sense of time ( ' Thompson 1942:1 ) , but more clearly  | connected to theology was the considerable development of hagiography ? biographies of the saints . Hagiography , as will be described in a later section , became one of the important mechanisms in the legitimation of Europe 's medieval nobility . Whether in hagiography or in other forms of medieval historical writing , one of the peculiar features of the period 's historiography is its striking impersonality : It is assuredly not without coincidence that we know so very little of the personal traits of most of the men who directed the path of medieval society . Hardly any personal correspondence has survived ; no personal anecdotes are there ; none of the stories which grow round great men exist ; there are few biographical data ; above all there is hardly any worthwhile contemporary biography or pictorial t ( presentation of the great kings , popes , or emperors . ( Ullmann 1966a:43 ? 44 ; see . also Ullmann 1966b ) What mattered was not the man but the office he occupied . Closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not individuals , was an extraordinary elaboration of ritual and etiquette ( Huizinga 1924 1950 ) . In spite of the medieval concern for the past , there were no professional historians ( Russell 1954a , 1954b ) , and history per se was not a part of the period 's university curriculum , except insofar as it was covered under the heading of grammar ( Holmes 5975 ; Lacroix 1954a ; Sanford 1944 ) . This was unfortunate , because medieval scholars were accustomed to " taking a limited subject matter and by scholastic processes . . . extracting all that could be drawn from the evidence , " which " is precisely what historians have to do " ( Russell 1954b:55 ) . One of the marks of the end of the Middle Ages is the Renaissance 's introduction of history into the educational curriculum . While his reference is to the " waning of the Middle Ages , " and therefore includes some characteristics I judge to be more connected with the early Renaissance than with the central features of medievalism , Huizinga ( 1950 ) isolates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ullmann , Huizinga found rulers and officials depicted in idealized stereotypes . Moreover , as a means of defending medieval ideas of hierarchy , the individual was deliberately ignored ; even eye-witness accounts reflected the " hieratic " . view of the time ( 1950:7 ) . Huizinga also found in medieval historiography a strong tendency to owl-generalization , weak reasoning , and a surprising inexactness ( 1950:214 , 216 ) . Lacroix ( 1954b:20 ) also notes the " disconcerting " weakness of medieval historians in the " interpretation of facts , " while Russell ( 1954b ) adds that the rules of logic were not applied to history . Huizinga was especially impressed by the stark contrast between the  | Middle Ages ' chivalric ideals and the realities of the period . The attempt of chroniclers to impose chivalric notions on history and biography was at the root of the distortions so characteristic of the age 's literature . And the fact that when honestly recording real people 's real behavior they exposed such a gap between ideal and real ? without noting the startling incongruity ? was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability . " As a principle of historiography , " he said , the chivalric political theory of the time was " very inferior " ( 1950:57 ) . Although much of Latin literature was known throughout the Middle Ages , some texts did effectively disappear ; most others were used only insofar as they could be interpreted to fit prevailing ideological concerns . Texts that could not be so interpreted were " consigned to oblivion " ( Ullmann 1966a:142 ; see also Shotwell 1923 ) . The writings of Cicero provide an illuminating example . In the Middle Ages the promotion of a few excerpts from his writings and the suppression of the great bulk of them allowed him to be presented " as if he had been himself a monastic scholar ? a recluse who seemed to teach contempt of marriage and women , and of all the passions and burdens of life in this world " ( Baron 1938 1968a:294 ) This was not a caricature , it was the opposite of the man 's views . Greek literature , except where known from Latin translations or epitomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In some respects the difference between medieval historiography and that of ancient and modern Europe is one of degree . Some features of medieval histories are good , some biography was written , some historians of the period do stand out . Perhaps the most frequently cited exceptions are Gregory of Tours , Bede , Einhard , and Otto ofFreising . An examination of these historians will set forth the high points of medieval historiography . Gregory of Tours ( 539 ? 594 ) wrote a history of the Franks down to his own time . Gregory consulted the relevant sources for earlier periods , but he shows his greatest strength in narrating events that he witnessed or was involved with ( Dalton 1927 ) . Insofar as he describes the actions of ' peoples from all walks of life , he provides a vivid picture of his times , but for all the vividness of events and action , he provides almost no physical descriptions , either of people , things , or places ( Dalton 1927 ) . Similarly , Gregory provides very little information , except unintentionally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the bishopric he headed ( Dalton 1927 ) , Gregory never intentionally falsifies , but he often quotes inaccurately , and he is highly biased toward kings ( as opposed to " landed aristocracy " ) and toward religious orthodoxy ; he will believe anything about saints , and he  | often sidetracks issues of cause and effect in order to shift more credit for events to the saints ( Dalton 1927 ) . The structure of Gregory 's History is irregular , the narrative often broken ; it lacks logical arrangement and is weak in causal analysis ( Dalton 1927 ) . Nonetheless , O.M . Dalton concluded that " the History of the Franks shines with a lonely brilliance in exceptionally dark skies . There is nothing like it at the time or second to it " ( 1927:31 ) . For all its importance in reconstructing the history of the Merovingian period , Gregory 's History is judged a " true history " only by comparison with the dry recitals of medieval chronicles or annals ( Dalton 1927:25 ) . It is not described as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ histories of the Greeks and Romans or the Renaissance historians . Dalton ( 1927 ) , who translated and provided a lengthy introduction to Gregory 's History , compares it only with Bede 's History , saying that Gregory 's Latin was poorer , but his account was livelier and more full of human interest than Bede 's . The Venerable Bede ( 673 ? 735 ) completed his Ecclesiastical History of the English People in 731 . Bede , too , produced more than a bare chronicle , more than popular hagiography : " He set himself to examine all available records , to secure verbal or written accounts from reliable living authorities , to record local traditions and stories , to interpret significant events , and , in short , to compile as complete and continuous a history of the English Church and people as lay within his power " ( Sherley-Price 1955 1977:25 ) . He was remarkably successful in this large and pioneering project . It contains many lively character sketches , is relatively free of inaccuracies , and remains an indispensable sourcework ( Colgrave 1969 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Bede that Barnes ( 1922:219 ) considered his work " a fine product of the lingering classical culture in the north of Europe " rather than a product of the Middle Ages , and Lacroix ( 1954b:22 ) calls him " one of the greatest historians of all times . " Campbell ( 1966:167 ) , calls him " almost a modern historian . " Sound as Bede 's work may have been , its flaws were characteristic of the age . The nearer Bede came to his own time , the less he wrote , and he by no means entirely escaped from the tradition of hagiography , the principles of which " were largely contrary to those of scholarship " ( Campbell 1966:182 ) . Bede 's partiality to miracles in the lives of the saints is only slightly less of an embarrassment than Gregory 's ( Colgrave 1969 ; SherleyPrice 19551 1977 ) . Bede was unduly circumspect in treating the authorities ? sacred or secular of his time ( Campbell 1966 ) . He was truly an exceptional historian , but the baseline from which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not alone , however , in producing relatively good history for the time ; the north of England showed an unusual interest in both history and biography in the eighth century ( Stenton 1971 ; Thompson 1942:I ) . Einhard ( c. 770 ? 840 ) served for decades in the court of Charlemagne . From this ideal vantage point he wrote the first and the best biography of a lay figure in the Middle Ages ( Painter 1960 ; Thorpe 1969 ; Zeydel 1972 ) . It is very brief ( about ten thousand words in English translation ) , it was written without any apparent author 's perspective ( Einhard never mentions his own name ) , it is occasionally careless with facts , and it omits or glosses over material that would detract from Charlemagne 's image , but on the whole it is reliable and has been very influential ( Painter 1960 ; Thompson 1942:I ; Thorpe 1969 ; Zeydel 1972 ) . Opinions vary considerably on Einhard 's stature as a historian ( see especially Zeydel 1972 ) . But one thing seems certain : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biographer than his counterparts in the classical world or the Renaissance . He modeled his biography on those of Suetonius , yet no one unambiguously says that he was the equal of Suetonius . It follows that if Einhard is the best biographer of the Middle Ages , medieval biography was either inferior to or only equal to that of classical Greece and Rome . The indications are that it was inferior . Einhard was not an exception but was instead part of the Carolingian Renaissance , which persisted well into the ninth century in spite of the troubled conditions that followed the death of Charlemagne in 814 . Next to Einhard , Nithard ( d. 844 ) was perhaps the best historian , but there were others too . The quantity of historical materials increased , and much of the Latin literature that has survived was copied at this time ( Lacroix 1954b ; Thompson 1942:I ) . With Otto of Freising ( c. 1113 ? 1158 ) we jump a few centuries ahead into the early stirrings of the Renaissance , the " renaissance of the twelfth century " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otto was " a careful and critical historian " ( Mierow 1928:3 ) . His major work was The Two Cities : A Chronicle of Universal History to the Year 1146 . He began , but did not live to complete , another important work , The Deeds of Frederick Barbarossa . Highborn , a bishop and a territorial lord , Otto was in a good position to observe the events of his time ( Haskins 1927 1966 ) . His Chronicle attempted to present the entire history of the world in a narrative style and comprehended as the eternal conflict between good and evil ( Mierow 1928 ) . Otto had , as Mierow observed , " absolute faith in an ever-active divine will , busying itself with the course of human events " ; " everything is judged  | and explained according to its place in the divine plan " ( 1928:52 , 62 ) . Otto was not , however , a miracle mongerer . Although he did not subject Christian legends to criticism , he generally refused to believe the improbable or impossible ( Mierow 1928 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see the effects of political partisanship in producing conflicting accounts , and he attempted to record impartially rather than pass judgment ( Mierow 1928 ; Thompson 1942:I ) . Rudimentary elements of social science appear in his writings : attempts to account for human development from primitiveness to civilization in the Chronicle ( Mierow 1928 ) , and for the rise of Lombardy 's wealthy and powerful city-states in the Deeds ( Haskins 1927 1966 ; Thompson 1942:I ) . Otto was " ahead of his time in regarding history as a teacher of men " ( Mierow 1928:22 ) . In addition to his lack of scruples about introducing " transcendental materials " into his history ( Mierow 1928:76 ) , Otto showed further characteristics of his age . Otto rarely mentions himself , and he did not regard " the individual as a principal factor in historical development " ( Mierow 1928:61 ) , though he did give more attention to individuals than was common in the Middle Ages ( Ullmann 1966a ) . He was not very original ( Mierow 1928 ) . According to Haskins ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otto with Tacitus and Thucydides , but Haskins does not concur . By Otto 's time , broad improvements in the quality of medieval historiography had been underway for some time . In order to put this improvement into perspective , let us review the major outlines of the fall and rise of historiography before Otto 's time . As we saw in the last chapter 's discussion of the late western empire , a decline in historiography began before the Middle Ages . The quality and quantity of historical writing then dropped to a low point in the seventh century ( Thompson 1942:I ) , hut signs of improving historiography were apparent in various parts of Europe well before the period normally indicated by the term Renaissance . In the Saxon dynasty in Germany ( 919-1024 ) , which was one of the first to achieve some stability after a period of turmoil , historiography began to revive ( Thompson 1942:I ) . In the succeeding Salian dynasty ( 1024-1125 ) , " for the first time since antiquity history began to be written with strength , clarity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wipo 's Life of Conrad II is the outstanding example . It even included an analysis of the social classes of Lombardy . The period 's historical writing in general was marked by increasing and more careful use of archival sources and official  | documents , more interpretation and explanation , more analysis of individual action , an increasing sense of the connections between events , and a growing awareness of the nature of historical change ( Thompson 194.2:I ) . Roughly coincident with these developments in Germany , historiography also showed strong development in Norman France and Angevin England ( Haskins 1915 , 1927 1966 ) . The Norman conquest gave a considerable impulse to historical writing , and Thompson concluded that the standards set in England between 1066 and 1215 were " unmatched anywhere else in medieval history , except possibly in Germany in the same centuries " ( 1942:I , 247 ) . The outstanding historians of the time and place were Ordericus Vitalis ( d. 1142 ) , William of Malmesbury ( d. 1142 ) , and William of Newburgh ( d. 1198 ) . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other signs of historiographic quality , the " fundamental principles of modern historical criticism , even the distinction between external and internal criticism " ( Thompson 1942:I , 251 ) . The Angevin rulers were exceptional in promoting historical writing . Under Henry II ( r. 1154 ? 1189 ) historians received quasi-official support ( Thompson 1942:I , 257 ) . Legal history was recorded in England in far greater detail and quantity than on the Continent ( Ullmann 1966a ) . In Italy historiography was slower to improve , but by the eleventh century the north Italian communes had begun to produce historians , who were usually laymen connected with the cities ' archives . Genoa was the first to officially recognize civic history ( Russell 1954a , 1954b ; Thompson 1942:I ) . Thus in the overall sweep of medieval history , Otto of Freising may have been exceptional , and he may have been an outstanding historian for his century , but clearly historiography was on the mend , and Otto was much less an exception than were Gregory or Bede . By the twelfth century , biography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their subjects were more likely to be secular . History was beginning to have a popular audience , the vernacular was coming into use , the universal chronicle was going out of fashion , and hagiography was in decline . Methodological awareness had developed too : Leo Marsicanus of Ostia ( c. 1046 ? 1117 ) had described his method , and Hugo of St. Victor ( d. 1143 ) , of whom Otto had been a student , had written a book on The Three Most Important Factors in Events , that is , time , place , and circumstance . Historical writings in general had become more common . In the eleventh century  | there was a general explosion of intellectual development ( Murray 1978 ; Russell 1954a ; Thompson 1942:I ) . From Otto 's time it was but a short leap to the more definitive dissolution of medieval historiography in Renaissance Italy . During much of the Middle Ages , Europe was highly decentralized , and travel between its regions was relatively difficult . Conditions found in one time and place may not have been found elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a different time . No doubt this accounts for the discrepancies in the views on medieval stratification , which now need to be reviewed . In the course of this review I will attempt to answer the following interrelated questions : If caste was found in medieval Europe , was it a continuation of conditions in late antiquity , or did it develop later ? When was caste most typical of medieval Europe , or when was social mobility least common ? When did social mobility pick up and caste decline ? What were the ideological stances of medieval Europeans on the matters of nobility and social mobility ? Were there important regional differences in all these matters ? Judgments of when medieval Europe became , or was most , castelike cover a wide spectrum . At one extreme , Bloch ( 1961:II ) argued that on the continent the period from about 1250 to 1400 saw the greatest rigidity of social stratification . A de facto nobility had developed earlier , but only in this period did nobility acquire legal definition in feudal Europe ( England excepted ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the nobility had already developed in the twelfth century , at least in France . It is possible , therefore , that the evidence on which Bloch 's argument rests resulted from belated reactions to forces working against nobility . For considerable evidence of a much earlier development of medieval Europe 's nobility is presented in two collections of major essays on the topic ( Cheyette 1968 ; Reuter 1978 ) . While some of the contributors to these volumes largely agree with Bloch , the predominant view in the relevant chapters is that hereditary stratification emerged much earlier as an amalgam of late Roman and barbarian institutions but that it was never rigidly hereditary and showed considerable regional variation . Reuter ( 1978:28 ) attempts a summary of the complex issues : " If one wished to sketch a picture of the nobility which  | would remain valid for the whole of the middle ages , one would have to confine it to a few characteristics : in particular the importance of blood . " Let us look at some of the evidence for this . There is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charisma ( Heil ) , but the evidence , while suggestive , is not clear that Germanic leadership was hereditary ( Reuter 1978 ; cf. Schlesinger 1968 ) . Be that as it may , a number of authorities stress the essential similarity of Germanic and Gallo-Roman lordship , so that the transition from late Roman to Merovingian lordship would have entailed no essential change ( Irsigler 1978 ) . Genicot 1968 argues that in Merovingian , Carolingian ( eighth to tenth centuries ) , and post-Carolingian times , the term noble definitely referred to a class or caste , not to personal qualities . He admits the difficulty of tracing the origins of medieval nobility but suggests that they lie in the Germanic kings ( principes ) , in the right-hand men of the barbarian kings , and in the descendants of the Gallo-Roman senators , with considerable regional variation . Whatever its origin , the nobility became a legal and hereditary class ( Genicot 1968 ) . Duby 1968 traces similar developments in the region of the Macconais . Whereas theoretically knighthood could be gained , and in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inheritance " from the beginning ( Duby 1968:151 ) . Thus knighthood was rapidly confined to a closed , hereditary class . By 1050 ? 1075 it was strictly hereditary , the title being taken by all male heirs of a knight who were not clergy . In Werner 's view ( 1978:141 ) , landed lordship , " the decisive factor in the economy of the early and high middle ages , " developed in late antiquity and was fully established in Gaul when the Franks took over . But the Gallo-Roman landlords , of senatorial rank , were not displaced by the Franks . The Roman and German elements quickly and easily blended into a state neither German nor Roman but Frankish . Werner did not think that the Gallo-Roman nobility had " racial " origins , but he was struck by how strong the dynastic sense of this new late Roman hereditary nobility was . Bishops of senatorial rank concerned themselves with the survival of their families . . . . Add to this the nepotism which enabled families to hold on to episcopal office . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potentes . . . and the remaining mass of the population . All this must mean that the culture , the life style , the political and economic position of the class which dominated the medieval centuries were all translated with no break in continuity from the world of late antiquity . ( Werner 1978:145 ? 46 )  | For Werner , the Germans only intensified and modified the basic pattern of the late empire , and within a century of the beginning of the Frankish kingdom , " the leading families of Roman and German origin in Gaul , the optimates of the court and the potentes of the provinces had intermingled to become a single class " ( 1978:146 ) . Irsigler 1978 traces a Frankish ruling class back to before the middle of the fifth century . Among its characteristic qualities was " membership by birth of a family of high reputation " ( 1978:123 ) . Irsigler found that the process of assimilation of the Roman senatorial nobility began before the middle of the sixth century but was not entirely complete in the seventh . Whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as time went on they were presumed to have been ; hereditary claims were traced to them . Thus Tellenbach ( 1978:207 ) , treating the Carolingian period , mentions that " the Germanic belief in royal charisma and the Christian and theocratic conception of kingship as an office made the king a member of a supernatural order . " Moreover , " the nobility also possessed their own distinct powers . According to Germanic thinking not only the royal but also other kin groups had a heritable charisma . " For Tellenbach ( 1978:204 ) , " nobility was acquired by birth , certainly . " Not only did the nobility share the charisma of royalty , but according to Bosl ( 1968 ) the rule of the nobility was more fundamental than kingship in tenth- through twelfth-century Germany . Finally , Hauck ( 1978 ) shows that in the literature of the eleventh and twelfth centuries , noble families traced their origins to pre-Christian sources , in one case probably back to Woden . Although Reuter ( 1978 ) reports that there is considerable biological continuity demonstrable between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eleventh and twelfth , most of the contributors to his volume stress the enormous difficulties presented by genealogical research in the medieval period . Werner 1978 , for example , notes the frequency of missing genealogical links , which can only be filled in by guessing . " From the viewpoint of the critical historian , this is to tremble on the brink , not just of error , but of catastrophe " ; the man who tries to use guesswork to fill in genealogical lacunae " is no longer dealing with history , but fiction " ( Werner 1978:151 ) . Although modern historians may shrink from the problems of establishing the continuity of noble lines , medieval authors were often much less circumspect , as will be seen below . Most modern authors seem to argue that the nobility was never rigidly closed . Genicot , for example , tried to show that some noble families seemed  | to vanish , replaced by others not previously recorded . He thought it advantageous to kings to favor new nobility over old . The process of the renewal of nobility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1978 ) . Bosl traces the slow process whereby the ministeriales , unfree officials of the German emperor , had by the twelfth century slowly been converted into a new nobility as emperor and court sought allies against the lay and ecclesiastical lords ( 1978 , see also Genicot 1968 ) . The ministeriales used " ideology , history and myth " to legitimate their rise ( Bosl 1978:300 ) . A sympathetic chronicler alleged , for example , that the ministeriales received their high status from Julius Caesar ( Bost 1978 ) . In spite of the power and prestige they ultimately achieved , the humble origins of the ministeriales were long remembered by the old nobility . Thus certain monasteries , which " were mostly noble foundations with an advocacy restricted to the caste ' ( Hirsch ) of nobles , rejected ministeriales " ( Bosl 1978:308 ) . This is very reminiscent of the ponderous motion of the upwardly mobile caste in India . Schlesinger 1968 argues that the Germanic and Frankish kings often sought to turn the nobility into a class of officials who could be dismissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nobility and elevated to office whom he would . He thus made a start on the creation of a true " administration , " but on his death the nobility reasserted itself . On the other hand , when non-nobles did succeed in achieving high status , they quickly claimed to be ancient nobility . Although the evidence is poor , there also appear to have been ways in which nobility could be lost , resulting in downward social mobility . Loss of territorial jurisdiction is thought to have been decisive , and derogeance ( akin to outcasting ) allegedly lowered the status of those who violated the code of nobility ( Bitton 1969 ; Duby 1968 ) . Virtually all sources agree that there were substantial regional as well as temporal variations in social stratification in medieval Europe ( see , e.g. , Genicot 1978 ) . In Germany and in most of France , nobility was more hereditary ; to the south , less so . Indeed , the whole first rank of territorial nobles was gone from much of Italy by very early in the twelfth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also note that the hereditary principle was much less in evidence in England ( Reuter 1978 ) . Although a de facto nobility developed there as on the Continent , it never achieved legal definition , nor did it become really closed ( Bloch 1961:II ) . In contrast to the situation across the Channel , " English society was an astonishingly egalitarian structure " ( Bloch 1961:II , i31 ) . Ullmann ( 1966a:8s ) linked Eng- land 's difference to a more perfect feudalism , which prevented the full rationalization of the theocratic-hierarchic structure of medieval society : " Feudal law ... was applicable to all conditions of man in England .. . and through its equalizing effects it prevented , above all , the emergence of a caste . " On the Continent , by contrast , medieval society was divided into estates that were entirely a matter of " custom and tradition " ( rather than Roman-canonical law ) , that were distinguished by " sharp cleavages , " and between which individuals could not move ( Ullmann 1966:41 ) . The norms of behavior for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also a matter of custom , but it contained a feature that Ullmann ( 1966a ) concluded ultimately facilitated the demise of medieval estates : the idea of contract that was central to feudal relations . Whereas in the prevailing theocratic ideal there was no right of resistance against a superior , the feudal vassal was allowed to repudiate his contract with a lord who did not fulfill his obligations to him . In England , feudal contract was given freer reign , or was given it earlier , than on the Continent . In sum , it is necessary to admit whole or partial exceptions at various times and places , yet there is substantial agreement on significant degrees of hereditary closure in medieval Europe . Complementing the primary concern with nobility in Reuter 1978 and Cheyette 1968 is a recent work ( Murray 1978 ) that is primarily concerned with medieval European social mobility , its temporal profile , indices , causes , and consequences . Murray sees some signs of social mobility in the tenth century , but he sees more substantial signs of " an acceleration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . As indices of social mobility , Murray focuses on depictions of the wheel of fortune ; satirical and moralistic criticism of ambition , avarice , and simony ; increasing concern with the virtue of prudence ; and other more direct indications . Murray is particularly concerned with the monetization of the economy and the rise of centralized states as causes of increasing social mobility , but he also gives considerable importance to the universities once they were established . Finally , Murray sees a whole new civilizational orientation emerging as a consequence or concomitant of the rise of social mobility . In the early medieval period , European civilization was marked by a " Hebraic " emphasis on will and by innumeracy , monasticism , and a belief in miracles ; after the millennium the orientation was increasingly numerate , and " Greek " in its rationality or intellectualism ( 1978 ) . Relying particularly on the works of Karl Werner , Murray rejects the  | idea ( attributed to Bloch above ) that social mobility was substantial until the second half of the eleventh century . While it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , in that several of the most noble French families trace their descent from earlier upstart heroes , these histories were apparently fabricated . When attempts are now made to trace the noble lineages back in time , they go not to upstarts but simply further and further back ? to Carolingian and possibly even Merovingian times ? while remaining noble . Murray speculates that the nobles adopted shorter genealogies and heroic but human apical ancestors because of " a fashion , growing in the eleventh century , for the acquisition of rank by virtue " ( 1978:94 ) . The main focus of Murray 's work , however , is not on the centuries before the millennium . He is mostly concerned with the period from about Imo to about 1300 and the evidence that social mobility was then on the increase . Laying groundwork for the changes he documents in that period was a " generic change in the European economy " between 975 and 1125 that " intensified up-and-down social mobility by way both of money and political power " ( 1978:18 ) . The " explosive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tremendous monetization of the Islamic world , a monetization that penetrated Europe first along its southern and western rims , then into its " nerve centers , " and finally into all its parts ( 1978:51 , 57 ) . This monetization had many consequences . Importantly , " liquidity in wealth " made for " social liquidity " and for an " abstraction of power , " meaning that power that was based on monetary wealth could be greatly centralized ( 1978 : 6o , 84 ) . Money needed to be counted . Those who handled money , and those who administered it and the projects it paid for , needed mathematical skills that had long been ignored in Europe . Those who acquired these skills could rise on " society 's two main staircases " : commerce and government service ( 1978:206 ) . Murray thinks that those who rose in government ? the German ministericales referred to earlier and the aristocracy that formed around the dukes of Normandy , for example ? were more numerous or successful . Numeracy was but one of several intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The idea that reason in general could have value strengthened measurably between ' Too and 1300 . Both church and state began to provide education for promising men regardless of their background , a movement that culminated in the formation of the medieval universities . The nexus between the state , money , numeracy , and rationality is illustrated in the Secretum , Secretorum , a pseudo-Aristotelian text translated  | into Latin from Arabic and widely circulated between the early twelfth and the mid-thirteenth centuries . It made shrewd observations on politics and noted the necessity of money in a centralized state . It extolled the role of reason in the state and advised the ruler to stress intellectual skills in choosing ministers . Of the sciences that a ruler should cherish in his officials , it said , arithmetic was the most important . Men did in fact rise on the basis of mathematical skills . The Secretum made no mention of birth qualifications . Running to some forty printed editions , it was read in high as well as low political circles ( Murray 1978 ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rationalistic culture " mainly borne by the upward-moving battalions on the Wheel of Fortune ; by those who responded . . . to the pulling power of social rank " ( Murray 1978:137 ) . In this environment , history began to defend itself for its " prudential value , " for its aid in avoiding mistakes : " the past , . . . not unlike the astrologers ' stars , revealed the future " ( 1978:131-32 ) . Murray sees an awareness of the existence of social mobility in a strong twelfth-century concern with the rise and fall of empires , and in the above-mentioned depictions of the Wheel of Fortune , the first to survive being one from England around 1170 . Further evidence was found in the considerable discussion of avarice and ambition , the latter " in the sense of a desire to climb to the top of the social scale " ( 1978:81 ) . John of Salisbury 's Policraticus ( c. 1159 ) , for example , devoted fifty pages to a discussion of ambition , came close to approving it in lay politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prestige affects high and low " ( Murray 1978:81 ) . An awareness of social mobility was , however , not the same as approval . According to Murray ( 1978:274 ) , the attack on hereditary nobility " was not spelt out fully before the fifteenth century " ? and was largely connected with events in Italy to be explored in the next chapter ? but the discussion was underway much earlier . Murray devotes considerable space to an analysis of the ideological stances toward nobility and merit in medieval Europe . His main conclusions are that Biblical references , being contradictory on the issue , could never settle it firmly one way or the other but that the Church was legally open , though in practice often closed , and that the tripartite ideology of society divided into those who fought , prayed , and worked was probably a reaction to the perception that social mobility was taking place . These and other points concerning the ideology of stratification in medieval Europe will he taken up in the next section . First , however , I will close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptionally sound medieval historians can be shown to have been writing during periods of comparative stratificational openness . By way of an introduction to his translation of Gregory of Tours ' History of the Franks , for example , Dalton ( 1927 ) provides an extensive discussion of early Merovingian society . He explicitly indicates that in this period strata were not as rigidly hereditary as they had been and were to be : " A real hereditary nobility was not ... found until later than the sixth century , it did not exist in the fifth " ( 1927:386n ) . He adds that Merovingian society was stratified , but not so rigidly as in the later days of imperial power . Under the Empire a man born in one stratum had no chance of rising to another . Under the Franks , though in the main recognized divisions were kept apart , the individual might improve his position if he found favour with the great or could amass a certain amount of money . A man of servile origin might become a count . ( 1927:383 ) Gregory himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long tradition of providing many of the bishops of Tours ( Dalton 1927:4 ) . In spite of his connection with nobility , Gregory firmly sided with royal power in its attempt to weaken the landed aristocracy , as I noted earlier . The landed aristocracy was destined to prevail , however , and early in the seventh century ? after Gregory 's time ? they won the upper hand ( Dalton 1927 ) . Thus Gregory 's time seems to have provided a window of stratificational openness sandwiched between more closed periods . In many respects , however , Gregory 's History shows the signs of European medievalism ; he neglected education , for example , and the sciences ( Dalton 1927 ) . The family background of Bede , who lived in a monastery from age seven onward , is unknown ( Sherley-Price 1955 1977 ) . Unusually numerate for his time , he was one of the five great mathematicians of the Middle Ages , all of whom became friends of kings ( Murray 1978 ) . Stenton 1971 provides an extensive discussion of stratification in seventh- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basically divided into two strata . At the lower level was the ceorl , the free peasant landowner . He was armed , was accustomed to adjudicating law in local assemblies , owned property individually , and generally recognized no lord between himself and the king . " Throughout early English history " Stenton points out , " society in every kingdom rested on men of this type " ( 1971 : 278 ) . Ranking above the ceorl , in a generally rank-conscious society , was the gesith . The root meaning of the term is " companion , " and " there is little doubt that membership of a king 's bodyguard had formed the primitive  | test " of gesith status in most of the kingdoms for which information is available ( Stenton 1971:303 ) . The one exception is the southerly kingdom of Kent , where somewhat stronger traces of an old hereditary nobility persisted ( Stenton 1971 ) . Elsewhere , if there had been an indigenous nobility , it had largely disappeared , and if the invading Anglo-Saxons had possessed a nobility , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had disintegrated " it ( Stenton 1971:304 ) . A landed elite was coming into being , with land as the reward for service to the king , but it was far from a dominant element in Bede 's time ( Stenton 1971 ) . In spite of the later development of a landed elite , there are various indications that conditions in the British Isles remained generally less castelike than on the Continent ( see , e.g. , Ullmann 's comments on feudalism above , Tocqueville 1856 1955 , and Macfarlane 1978 ) . The work of Bede and his colleagues may also have been stimulated by learned refugees from Syria and Africa who reached England in 669 and 670 ( Murray 1978 ) . Einhard was of noble or " comparatively noble " lineage ( Thorpe 1969:13 ; see also Zeydel 1972 ) , yet , like Gregory , he lived in a period of relative openness . Charlemagne 's reorganization of the empire rested on the use of men of talent without regard for their birth status : " Plebian or patrician , it mattered nothing to Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and promoted them to vacant offices or preferments " ( Thorpe 1969:10 ) . Thus under Charlemagne social stratification was opened for a while . Historical and other studies flourished for a period , too , giving rise to the Carolingian Renaissance . Otto of Freising was definitely of noble stock and was very highly placed ( Mierow 1928 ) , but he lived at a time when , in the wake of the Crusades and the resulting reentry of Europeans into East-West trade , the stirrings of social mobility and its concomitants were felt , especially in southern Europe ( Haskins 1927 1966 ) . While he apparently did not approve , Otto was well aware of these new conditions : " He was oppressed by the fact that the great sink into insignificance and the strong fall down from their power and their pride " ( Mierow 1928:58 ) . In his Deeds ofFrederickBarbarossa Otto analyzed the class system of the city-states of Lombardy , in which men of humble birth were promoted to high office if they served their city well , and added that " to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world in riches and power " ( quoted in Haskins 1927 1966:243 ) . For the reasons spelled out in Murray 1978 , Otto is simply too near the Renaissance to count as a serious exception .  | Serious or not , these exceptions can be put in perspective by taking stock of what has so far been said about stratification in medieval Europe . First , there is good evidence of legal and actual caste , even though there are real problems in interpreting the way in which these two aspects of closure tracked one another . Second , there were three situations in which caste tended to be absent or to break down : ( i ) certain regions ? particularly peripheral ones ? were less castelike , ( 2 ) centralizing states were less castelike , and ( 3 ) the period after the millennium showed a general trend to increasing social mobility . As mentioned above , England was one of the regions more prone to openness , and there is also some evidence of stronger historiographic traditions there . The Norman regions were also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent descendants of Viking raiding bands and hence in some sense an upstart aristocracy in all their areas ( Douglas 1964 ; Haskins 1915 ) . Moreover , the bureaucracies of Norman administrations ( Haskins 1927 1966 ) suggest meritocratic principles . Murray 1978 cites the Normans as an example of a centralizing state creating scope for social mobility , mostly after the millennium . Correspondingly , the historiographic tradition of the Norman areas was relatively sound . However poor medieval European historiography may have been , it was never as absent as in India . We can , as a consequence , speak with more confidence about the linkages between social stratification and historiography in medieval Europe . This section explores relationships between social stratification and the doctrines and institutions of the Middle Ages , particularly those of Christianity . There is no denying the role of clerics in composing medieval history , or in imposing theocratic perceptions on historiography . The intervention of churchmen is direct and obvious . What is much less obvious , in terms of modern conceptions , is what Christianity could have to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imaginable in modern Euro-American Christian terms , was the alignment of Europe 's noble pedigrees with the sources of Christian charisma , especially with the early Christian saints . Another key is the extent to which religion was the handmaiden of the nobility of medieval Europe . Finally , the chivalric code provided links between hereditary nobility and fictive history , links that were largely mediated by clerics , though more because of their literacy than their religious functions . When one recalls that Constantine was particularly involved in the  | legislation of caste and the promotion of Christianity , it is tempting to ask whether there may have been some direct connection between these policies . Perhaps the Christian doctrine of acceptance , in the form of " Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar 's ; and unto God the things that are God 's , " facilitated the imposition of caste . Whatever the case , over the centuries " the things which are Caesar 's " and " the things that are God 's " came to mean empire and Church . An ideology profoundly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twin pillars , but in spite of inspired defenses of the idea that men are by nature unequal and that this is part and parcel of the great scheme of things ( Lovejoy 1942 ) , the idea that these inequalities are inherited was by no means clearly and consistently elaborated as a point of doctrine . Saints Ambrose and Augustine stressed faith and conduct above birth , and Boethius said that all mankind are one ( Murray 1978 ) . Yet there is Biblical support for nobility , as in : " By me princes rule and nobles govern the earth " ( Proverbs 8.6 ) . And while some proclaimed Christ 's common status , others pointed to his genealogies in Matthew and Luke and declared him noble ( Murray 1978 ) . The Church was thus either ambivalent on the matter of equality and nobility or managed to accommodate both principles ( Murray 1978 ) . An obscure feature of medieval culture ? its fascination with " monstrous races " ? illustrates the way in which Scripture could be used more directly to defend hereditary stratification . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no heads and whose faces were on their chests , the Cynocephali , who had the heads of dogs , and the Sciopods , who had one large foot with which to shade themselves from the sun . The monstrous races have definable connections with the Germanic biological and racial theories that " shaped the middle ages " ( Werner 1978:142 ) . Monstrous races were known to the Greeks and Romans ? Pliny produced an influential catalogue of them ? but interest in them increased in late imperial Rome , reached a peak in the Middle Ages , and then diminished in the Renaissance ( Friedman 1981 ) . Furthermore , medieval Europeans , " obsessed as they were by genealogies , " had a strong genealogical interest in the monstrous races ( Friedman 1981:92 ) . Friedman argues that belief in monstrous men met some sort of " psychological need " of the medieval mind ( 1981:24 ) . The idea of monstrous races seems to have had its origin in Greek contacts with India ( Friedman 1981 ) , which suggests that Indian notions of caste and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' classification stretching from monstrous races through the castes to  | the gods ? that is analogous to medieval notions about racial and species differentiation ( and possibly of Egyptian representations of gods and men too ) . In each case an attempt to assert elaborate speciation where it does not exist accounts for specieslike hierarchical differences among humans in a scheme of classification that stretches above and below humanity . The basic attitude of medieval Europeans was that the monstrous races were in some sense men ( i.e. , descendants of Adam and Noah ) , yet they were inferior . With a few exceptions they were depicted in ways that illustrated their inferiority ; for example , they were shown using crude clubs as weapons , rather than the equipment available to a medieval warrior ( Friedman 1981 ) . The inferiority of the monstrous races was explained in specifically Biblical and genealogical terms : in the Middle Ages " genealogy offered the most direct approach to any problem of identity , and the monstrous races were no exception in this regard " ( Friedman 1981:88 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept of the decay of species that was natural to Judeo-Christian culture , " even though the scriptures themselves exhibit no interest in monstrous races ( Friedman 1981:89 ) . Adam had been made in God 's image , but clearly many of his descendants fell short of that ideal . These deviations were explained either by " alien strains " entering the line of descent or by divine punishment ( 1981:89 ) . The monstrous races were considered to be descendants of Cain or Ham , the sons cursed by Adam and Noah . This line of reasoning was applied to the medieval social order by exaggerating the difference between the high- and the low-born and by stereotyping the latter as " comic , crude , and even monstrous " ( Friedman 1981:102 ) . Friedman cites a series of works on heraldry that explained the difference between " churls " and " gentlemen by nature " in terms of the hereditary curses upon Cain and Ham . To complete the connection between monstrous races and medieval Europe 's lower orders , Friedman says that peasants ( as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature defending themselves with clubs , the symbol of the inferiority of the monstrous races . The most elaborate moral discussion of the monstrous races occurred in a late-thirteenth-century poem , " De Monstruosis Hominibus , " written by a cleric , and for a " probably aristocratic audience " ( Friedman 1981:127 ) . The authorship and audience of this poem suggest the ideological importance of the line of reasoning connected with monstrous races . According to this ideology , humanity was subdivided into strata , each at a  | distance from divinity that indicated the extent to which it had fallen from an original high state . While the warfare that brought about the ascendance of secular over religious authority bulks large in the memory of most modern Europeans , these two forms of authority were closely aligned in much of the medieval world , with the nobles in a commanding position . The nobility " controlled the Church , and hence the spiritual and to a large extent intellectual life " from the Carolingian period to the later Middle Ages ( Werner 1978:138 ; see also Bosl 1978 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Tellenbach 1978 ) . Noble control of religious life took two forms . First , and probably most important , the high positions in church and monastery were in practice confined to nobles ? although an occasional plebian did climb to high position . Pope Leo said that priests who had been serfs " polluted " holy orders , while nobles honored church office ( Murray 1978:323 ) . Second , many religious institutions were open only to nobles . Given this sort of representation in or patronage of religion , noble points of view were unlikely to be very directly attacked or undermined by theologians . On the contrary , religious views were likely to take on a noble slant , which they did . Hagiography , wherein " the stereotypical reaches its apogee " ( Ullmann 1966b:299 ) , was the main vehicle , according to Irsigler : One is forced to agree with the theory which has been put forward again and again in recent research , that noble families or kin-groups were credited with a particular Heil or charisma .... F. Prinz ' thesis that Merovingian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving a new religious and specifically Christian sanction to noble leadership in Francia , which had lost the old pagan charismatic sanction . . . " ( Prinz 1965:548 ) , can scarcely be demonstrated . . . as far as the loss of the pagan charisma . . . is concerned . . . . The second part of the thesis , however , can be verified . The hagiographers of the seventh to ninth centuries , many themselves of noble origin , . . . provided a justification of the aristocratic organization of early medieval society , at least unconsciously , by creating a new ideal of the noble saint . . . . Prinz cites as evidence their regular stress on noble origin . . . and the fact that the earlier political and governmental activities and the family connexions of saints were given an emphasis unusual in this type of source . ( Irsigler 1978:112 ? 13 ) Hagiographers , Irsigler says , showed an " extraordinarily positive attitude " " in their descriptions of the typical forms , contents and symbols of the noble way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all were the ones who adopted the monastic ideal " ( 1978:113 ) . Hagiography thus effected a gradual shift in the image of the saints . In early Merovingian  | hagiography , saints were only metaphorically warriors ; as in late antiquity , they rode donkeys . Before the end of the Merovingian period , we see the " Saint on his charger , the owner of bloodstock envied by princes " ( Irsigler 1978:122 ) . Even accounts of the people saints wined and dined with served as vehicles for linking saintliness with nobility ( Irsigler 1978 ) . The " selfsanctification " of Europe 's medieval nobility was " by no means unconscious " ( Irsigler 1978:113 ) . To summarize , the " strictly ascetic and monastic saintly ideal of late Roman Gaul " gave way by the seventh and eighth centuries to the ideal of the " noble saint " ( Irsigler 1978:112 ; Genicot 1978 ) . Once the saints had been made nobles , the next step was to incorporate them into noble genealogies . Irsigler gives various examples of kingly and noble families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to associate themselves with sanctity and " blood-charisma " ( 1978:114 ; see also Schlesinger 1968 ) . Hauck 1978 cites similar material ( such as the Nibelungenlied ) from the eleventh- and twelfth-century literature of noble house and kindred . Some , perhaps even many , of the genealogical claims may have been valid ; in the long run , nobles did achieve sainthood in very disproportionate numbers ( Murray 1978 ) . But other of the claims have helped to earn medieval Europe its reputation for fabulous genealogies . I have already mentioned the noble family that appeared to trace back to Woden . Schmid ( 1959 1978:49 ) , in a study of the nobility in the earlier Middle Ages , found " a general pride in being able to trace oneself back to an especially famous chief ancestor ' .... Such pride was not always justified . At times such chief ancestors ' were invented or simply appropriated for one 's own family ; this was notably true in late antiquity , and in the later middle ages . " Indeed , it would be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clogged the courts with people trying to prove their descent from persons of high status and generally set off an orgy of genealogical research and fiction writing . If so , the orgy was to last for a long time . Werner ( 1978:200 ) , for example , cites " the extraordinary success " of a set of fictitious genealogies in Carolingian times , while Baron ( 1966:422n ) takes note of a " fabulous " pedigree that claimed as late as the 1400s descent from Abra ham , Aeneas , and Romulus . Such claims were not exceptional , nor were they quickly forgotten in the Renaissance or later . Florence King , in South ern Ladies and Gentlemen ( 1976 ) quite precisely , and amusingly , dissects the mental links between overzealous genealogical research and status based on blood in the American South of our own time . Bogus genealogy was not the only tactic of noble self-sanctification that  | involved reconstructing the past . Hauck 1978 describes the quests of nobles for holy relics that they might use as the new core of family traditions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festivals of the pagan period . In the place of natural causation , for which they showed little concern , medieval historians saw " nobility of blood and heavenly aid " as the requirements of political success , with relics " as the commonest channel of divine favour " ( Southern 1970:190,191 ) . The transfer of powerful relics from one location to another , for example , was used to account for transfers of authority . The quantity and variety of relics obtained at this time remains a scandal to this day . The lay literature that embodied fictitious genealogy , relic quests , and the like , though probably written by religious figures , is thought to have been read aloud in the households it eulogized , possibly by the dynasts themselves . The noble members of these households were not " passive recipients of intellectual . . . culture , " but were instead patrons ( Hauck 1978:79 ) . Hauck thinks that a careful consideration of the implications of noble patronage of medieval culture might go a long way toward making the medieval period more intelligible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the written materials still available to us , was probably even more lavish in its praise of nobility . Huizinga 's discussion of late medieval chivalry , mentioned earlier , provides further insight into the linkage between medieval nobility and historiography ( 1924 1950 ) . He stresses the great social distance between t he ranks of society and says that the chronicles and literature of the period gave more attention to nobility and its code of chivalry than we now realize . Even " in the fifteenth century chivalry was still , after religion , the strongest of all ethical conceptions which dominated the mind and heart " ( ( 1924 1950:47 ) . Since the social hierarchy was seen as a set of steps leading up to God , each order 's value depended not on its utility " but on its sanctity ? that is to say , its proximity to the highest place " ( 1924 1950:48 ) . The unworthiness of the individuals comprising it in no way detracted from the " sacred character " of the nobility ( 1950:48 ) . Chivalry was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of non-nobles . But chivalry , as the basis of society , was an illusion , consistently clashing with reality . The clash is glaringly visible in the chronicles of the time , as already noted . According to Huizinga , the discrepancy between the chivalric ideal and reality was so great that the ideal was only realized in the tournament , that is , in a make-believe world of ceremony . In a related consideration , Huizinga notes the great social distance between medieval  | ranks and draws attention to the associated elaborate ceremony which , veiling " cruel reality under apparent harmony , made life an art " ( 1950:4-4 ) . Substituting art for reality is a common feature of the caste-organized society . Among the arts that flourished in medieval Europe was forgery ( Ullmann 1965 ) . Forgery reflected the tendency to explain social institutions in terms of the authority of Rome and the early church fathers , and the willingness to produce false documents . The previously mentioned Donation of Constantine was the most spectacular example . It falsely bolstered both popes and emperors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Valla 144o 1922 ) . It gave to the clergy the status of Roman senators ( Valla 14.40 1922 ) , a status no doubt widely understood as hereditary at the time of the forgery . Forgery , fictitious genealogy , mythical history , the sanctification of early nobles , the nobilization of early saints , the acquisition of alleged relics ? all these have in common the presentation of the past in a way contrary to what actually happened , and all were linked in that this presentation of the past was in substantial measure dictated by the political needs of a hereditary nobility that , precisely because it was hereditary , could only be legitimate if it had illustrious ancestors and other proofs of nearness to divinity . The fiction of the tournament and the fictions created about the past were two facets of the same phenomenon . All were further linked in that the ideologues who put the past in writing were mostly churchmen , who in turn generally were nobles themselves , were under the control of nobles , or were under noble patronage . Lastly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobility and caste . Hence the links are definable between hereditary nobility , ahistoricity , and the Christian character of the Middle Ages . Ideological considerations of the sort that underpinned medieval conceptions of monstrous races suggest that the period was not characterized by a uniform conception of human nature , or that the uniformities were minimized in defense of caste . A twelfth-century abbess who excluded non - noble women from her convent neatly expressed the idea that mankind is composed of a set of separate races or species : " Who , unless he courts ruin , puts all his farm-stock into one shed : oxen , asses , sheep , and kids all together ? " ( quoted in Murray 1978:325 ) . Individualism was noticeably absent , as was shown earlier , Biography  | was largely replaced with the pious stereotypes of hagiography . The tendency to portray the status rather than the individuality of humans was characteristic of medieval art . " The artist , " Ullmann asserts , " took infinite pains to depict the garments and paraphernalia of the office which his subject occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or symbolic elements or ritual features " ( 1966a : l-4 ) . Medieval thought gave little attention to real human nature , or even to nature in general ( Ullmann 1966a , 1966b ) . These characteristics of the medieval period were not due to a lack of ability but , according to Ullmann , to a lack of interest . Only in the twelfth and , more noticeably , the thirteenth century was a beginning made in considering the human individual ? as a human ? in his capacity for making history . At the same time , naturalism began to develop in the arts and sciences ( Ullmann 1966b ) . Only with the full-blown development of humanism in the Renaissance was the real man to emerge from the obscurity of medieval stereotypes ( Ullmann 1966b ) . Huizinga disagrees , saying that " naive " realism was a characteristic of medieval art that the Renaissance transcended ( 1924 1950:24-3 ; Huizinga 1959 ) . But his examples of naive realism are all from the late Middle Ages ? the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries ? and especially from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakdown of caste were very similar to what will be described in the next chapter . The movement from stereotype to a naive realism and on to the sort of realism that penetrates character was a continuous process that is temporally coincident with increasing social mobility after the millennium . In the near-millennium , when the individual was unimportant , there was no political science , either ( Ullmann 1966a ) . The innumeracy of the Middle Ages ( Murray 1978 ) was a barrier to all sorts of scientific development , and certainly to any sort of economics . While it is now established that technological developments of enormous import took place in medieval Europe , the comparative hostility of the period to the sciences , natural or social , is beyond dispute : The period between the decline of Rome and the twelfth-century " renaissance " has traditionally been looked upon as the " dark age " of theoretical science . There is some accuracy in this view . Compared to the earlier achievements of the Greeks and the contemporary activities of the Arabs , Latin natural philosophy remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Until the development of the universities , education tended to be very limited in effect a monopoly of the clergy , with the clergy in effect a
