Despite all the artistic developments in the last decade , from the growing importance of regional collectors and museums to an increasing internationalism reflected by the renewed American interest in the contemporary art of Europe , New York remains the testing ground , the information and publishing base , the arena where works are bought and sold. // " The resources in this city are just unparalleled , " said William Agee , former director of the Houston Museum of Fine Arts . " The other day I started in SoHo and saw the shows of Robert Morris and Robert Rauschenberg . Then I went over to Madison Avenue and walked uptown . I stopped at the Morgan Library and saw the illuminated manuscripts and the Rembrandt prints . Then I visited a number of galleries . Then I went to the Frick , where I saw an exhibition of clocks and looked at the two Vermeers. // " It was overwhelming . There ' s no other city in which I could have taken a journey like that . " There is no other city , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is as solid , from top to bottom , as it is in New York . Several European cities have some of the ingredients of an art world . London and Paris have their great museums and universities . Cologne , Dusseldorf , Berlin , Milan and Rome have thriving contemporary art communities . <> <> All the Ingredients // But since the late 1950 ' s , when New York replaced Paris as the art capital , no other city has had all the ingredients : the artists , the galleries , the art market , the museums , the scholarly institutions , the publications and a broad-based , committed public. // New York ' s pre-eminence was the result of a number of factors , including the immigration of a number of prominent European artistic figures to New York during the Second World War , the development of Abstract Expressionism in the city in the postwar period and the advantageous economic position of the United States compared with Europe after the war. // " New York is still the beacon , and indisputably so , " said Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It has the largest possible critical mass of galleries , artists , dealers and audience . In the foreseeable future , I don ' t see any challenge. " // The city ' s continued pre-eminence in the art world in the last 10 years comes at a time when interest in art has increased dramatically across the country . Partly because more people have been exposed to art history courses in universities , there are now more people looking at and collecting art . " Up to a generation ago , the average educated American was a visual illiterate , " said Elizabeth C. Baker , editor of Art in America magazine . " Now there is a widespread knowledgeable public , which you did not have before. " // " The broader segment of the population here has been educated , " said Arnold Glimcher , director of the Pace Gallery . " The Europeans are just elitist . Education is in the hands of very few people . In France art is something for a bunch of intellectuals to fight over . " <> <> Part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , art has become part of the fabric of American life . This is reflected in the number and importance of regional collectors and museums . There is more money being spent on art , and there are more ambitious exhibitions being mounted outside New York. // The one part of the New York art world that has provoked widespread criticism outside New York City - the one area that may have lost rather than gained luster in the last 10 years - is the New York museums. // The permanent collections of such institutions as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art rank among the world ' s greatest . There is a belief , however , among some directors of regional museums and other professionals that museums around the country may now have surpassed New York museums in what they have accomplished and that the New York museums have not done an adequate job of presenting contemporary art. // Since 1980 , major exhibitions on Georges Braque , El Greco , Claude Lorrain , Philip Guston and the Dutch avant-garde movement De Stijl have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morley and Robert Mangold are among those that will bypass New York in the future . <> <> ' A Genuine Failure ' // " There ' s an incredibly entrenched snobbishness , possessiveness and ultimately a parochial attitude " on the part of the New York museums , said Jane Livingston , associate director of the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington. // " The important shows that bypass New York ultimately have an effect on artists and critics . There is a genuine failure in New York to understand the ramifications of not having the De Stijl show or the Malcom Morley retrospective , organized by the Whitechapel Gallery in London. " // " There is no way the entire area of contemporary art can be covered by the New York museums , " said Henry Hopkins , director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art . " There are increasingly fewer seminal exhibitions on contemporary art originating or even being seen in New York. " // " The National Gallery in Washington is really becoming our national gallery , in a way it wasn ' t 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall , what the National Gallery did - with the Braque , the Claude Lorrain , the Manet , the David Smith and the Maiolica exhibitions - was superior to anything in New York. " // New York museum directors emphatically reject claims that New York is no longer the museum center . William Rubin , director of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art , which for three years has had a limited exhibition schedule because of its building program , said : " There is a mathematical incompatibility " between what some museum professionals think ought to be done " and the possibilities of the three major museums of modern art in New York City , no one of which is devoted entirely to contemporary art . We are , after all , a museum of modern art , not just of contemporary art . " <> <> ' Limit to the Space ' // " The reference to the De Stijl exhibition , " he added , " is a canard . We would have had it if we were not in a building program . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that importance , falling within our purview , that we have failed to have. " // Thomas Armstrong , director of the Whitney Museum of American Art , said : " The difficulty is that there is a limit to the museum space in which shows organized outside New York can appear here. " // The exhibitions that bypass New York may eventually weaken New York ' s position as the capital of the art world . So may the growth of regional collectors and the rebirth of a vital contemporary art in Europe. // There has been a change not only in the importance of the work being done in Europe , which is no longer in the shadow of American art , but also in the American attitude toward Europe and contemporary European art . " There are clearer ideas emerging in Europe , and that has not been the case for the last 20 years , " Mr. Hopkins said . " There is a new expressionist mode , especially in Italy and Germany , spread throughout Europe , that has become unquestionably the dominant factor in contemporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There ' s a genuine internationalism now , " Mr. Friedman said . " The hostility and suspicion towards Europe that existed with the Abstract Expressionists and later have been dissolved. " // Despite the changes , however , for the moment there is no sense of absence or lack in New York . According to the Annual Guide to Galleries , Museums and Artists published last year by Art in America magazine , of the 3 , 159 museums and galleries in the United States , 434 are in New York City . Chicago has the next highest number - 100 . There are 65 galleries and museums listed in Los Angeles and 34 in Washington. // Estimates of the number of artists in New York begin with 30 , 000 and go as high as 90 , 000 . Even with the increased internationalism and the renewed interest in contemporary European art , there is evidence that foreign artists - established as well as unknown - are settling in New York in greater numbers. // Three of the major figures in the recent revival of Italian art - Sandro Chia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . Howard Hodgkin , one of the most respected English painters of his generation , is spending more and more time in the city. // New York continues to be the heart of the art market . Gilbert Edelson , secretary and treasurer of the Art Dealers Association of America , estimates that as much as $1 billion worth of art sales are transacted in New York each year. // " The patrons and audience are here , " said Mr. Glimcher . " Not only is the greatest collecting populace in New York , but corporate patronage is based here . Exhibitions also bring collectors - even international collectors - to New York. " // New York is where collectors tend to begin . Margo Leavin , of the Margo Leavin Gallery in Los Angeles , said : " When new collectors come on the scene , they want major examples but they don ' t feel comfortable making choices . So they go to New York , which gives them the confidence and prestige they need . " <> <> Auction Houses See Shift // The art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recent financial reports of the two major New York auction houses , Christie ' s and Sotheby Parke Bernet. // For example , during Christie ' s first full New York season in 1978-79 , the auction house sold almost $13 million worth of pictures in New York compared with $75 million in London . In the fall of 1982 , Christie ' s sold almost $34 million in New York and $10 million in London . Sotheby ' s had a similar shift toward New York in the three-year period . The magnitude of the shift may be overstated by currency fluctuations , but the trend is clear. // There are indications that even the old master market , which to this point has largely been the province of Europe , particularly London , may be shifting to New York . In the last two years , three English old-master dealers opened galleries in New York . Several Paris gallery dealers are believed to be considering doing the same. // One of the English galleries that just opened a New York branch is Colnaghi ' s . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit it , but they are coming here every five minutes for sales , " said Franco Zangrilli , senior partner of Colnaghi U.S.A. " A foreigner is much more at peace dealing in New York than in London. " // The amount of money people outside New York are now putting into art coincides with the growth of regional centers and museums . There are artistic communities in cities like Kansas City and Houston where 20 years ago there were none . The Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth , the Getty Museum in Malibu and the Cleveland Museum of Art are examples of art institutions that can pretty much buy what they want . That there are so many young collectors from outside New York suggests that regional artistic centers and museums can only grow stronger . <> <> Center for Writing on Art // Just as New York continues to attract artists , it continues to attract people who write about art . " Most of the frequently published writers on art are in New York , " said Stephen Doherty , editor of American Artists magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are based in New York , as well as most of the important American art book publishers. // The presence in New York of so many artists and galleries and museums and so much media attention continues to be a tremendous stimulus and challenge. // " To make it in New York , " said Holly Solomon of the Holly Solomon Gallery , " to live here and cope with the scene , without burning out , an artist has to have tremendous rigor , energy and ambition . To sustain a career in New York is the hardest thing in the world. " // " Look at all the information that is available here , " Mrs. Solomon added . " Some artists can ' t take it and burn out . For those that do , however , the power is enormous. " //
