those close to him , and in a poem entitled " Eye and Tooth " he admitted , " I am tired . Everyone 's tired of my turmoil . " Small surprise then that Ian Hamilton 's relentless new biography , Robert Lowell , * soon turns into a turmoil chronicle , with Lowell swinging in and out of sanitoria as if he were being pitched into a revolving door . Brief holidays of sunlight are broken by pounding black squalls , and into the depot the locomotive crashes . WHEN genius goes wildly off the rails , the bones of innocent bystanders may be scattered for miles . The American poet Robert Lowell was such a locomotive of talent and fierce ambition , tossing off not only the famous poems of Life Studies and Lord Weary 's Castle but plays , reviews , bursts of polemic , scatters of reminiscence , and loose , idiosyncratic translations ( which he wisely labeled " imitations " ) . So determined and strapping a figure was Lowell that when he hopped the tracks into unruly dementia , it took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental ward . When Lowell had a HARPER'S/DECEMBER 1982 breakdown in Argentina in 1962 , six muscular numbers wrestled him into a straitjacket in a hotel corridor , and an awed witness to that tussle later commented : " I 'd never realized the power of mania , physically . " Lowell himself in a poem compared such struggles to scrambles on the football field in which " helmeted doctors " in white smocks hit him with a gang-tackle " and bury me running on the cleated field . " Although the thought of Lowell dodging shrinks as announcers shout themselves hoarse in the press booth is a comic hoot ( he 's at the ten , the twenty , the thirty . . . ! ) , his breakdowns were surely no treat to 0 N ONE level , Hamilton ( himself a poet and critic based in London ) has written a long study in lit-world discipleship . Even as a student , Lowell felt compelled to make disciples of his friends , down to setting the menu . " We had dreadful health food all the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lowell and Frank Parker in a cottage at Nantucket . " The diet was eels ? cooked by me , badly ? and a dreadful cereal with raw honey . All decided by Cal . " ( Cal , as in Caligula : Lowell 's despotic tendencies helped earn him a nickname inspired by the mad Roman emperor . ) Later , at Harvard , Lowell mapped out his friends ' futures . " He announced to Frank Parker and Blair Clark that the trio 's energies should henceforth be directed exclusively towards the arts . Parker , he declared , would be a painter ; Clark would be a musician ? or , failing that , a philosopher . He , Lowell , was the poet . Parker 's obedience was so complete that he left Harvard during his first year in order to devote himself to his new calling . . . . " As a caterpillar in the writing trade , Lowell would turn disciple himself , first to the poet Richard Eberhart ( who later wrote a verse play about Lowell called The Crystal Sepulcher , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after to the Southern " Fugitive " poet Allen Tate . In a famous incident , Lowell camped out on the Tates ' front lawn in Tennessee in a pup tent , his visit the result of a wiggy misunderstanding . " I think I suggested that may-53 be I 'd stay with them , " Lowell told an interviewer from the Paris Review . " And they said , ' We really have n't any room , you 'd have to pitch a tent on the lawn . ' So I went to Sears , Roebuck and got a tent and rigged it on their lawn . The Tates were too polite to tell me that what they 'd said had been just a figure of speech . " Allen Tate may well have regretted such hospitality ? years later , as a joke , Lowell presented Tate 's wife with a list of Tate 's lovers . Some joke ! ? duels have been fought for less . With discipleship comes a desire to instruct and bully , and some of the most unsettling pages in Robert Lowell show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world were his galleon . When a political scandal broke out at the writers ' retreat Yaddo involving its director , Elizabeth Ames ( she was accused of succoring a Marxist subversive ) , Lowell swanked about the deck with a cutlass eager for lopping . Presenting his case to the Yaddo board , Lowell described Mrs. Ames as " a diseased organ , chronically poisoning the whole system .... " Warnings were then fired broadside . If action is not taken by the Board that we consider adequate , I intend to confer with certain people in New York , among them Trilling , Rahv , Hook , and Haggin , and immediately to call a large meeting of the more important former Yaddo guests .... I think it only fair to tell the Board that I have myself influential friends in the world of culture what a telling phrase ! , nine-tenths of whom in the course of my ' ordinary correspondence and conversation will be informed of this affair within three months . I want to give their names-1 think it quite relevant : Santayana , Frost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think I 'm bluffing , I only know Miss Moore slightly but think she would agree ) , Bishop , Tate , Blackmur , Warren , Auden , Adams , Bogan , Empson . Of my own generation , Robert Fitzgerald , Jarrell , Bishop , Schwartz , Shapiro , Taylor , Powers , Stafford , and Berryman . We shall also take steps to see that the important people in the world of music and painting are fully informed . 1 should say , most of my friends are writers , but I have connections in Washington and I shall take steps to see that the matter is aired there , too . Oh , shove off , one mutters to the walls . When the swell of Lowell 's ego spilled over into madness , the name-dropping became even more grandly presumptuous . After one of Lowell 's crack-ups , the poet William Meredith visited him in the hospital and reported to friends , " He writes and revises translations furiously and with a kind of crooked brilliance , and talks about himself in connection with Achilles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaks your heart . " From Caligula to Hitler , tyrants trod a heavy step in Lowell 's steep , craggy mind , and it comes as sobering news that Lowell kept a copy of Mein Kampf on his shelf , disguised in a book jacket for Baudelaire 's Les Fleurs du Mal . Jonathan Miller , who spotted the book when he was in New York to direct Lowell 's The Old Glory for the stage , had other unsettling surprises in store . " ... I remember him meeting me at the airport and I could see him on the mezzanine , sort of sweating , and his spectacles seemed steamed over , and he came down to greet me and he was wearing an open-necked shirt and there was a huge medallion of Alexander bouncing on his chest . And as he greeted me there were three or four Hasidic rabbis coming off the plane and a sort of mischievous look came into his eyes , and he said , ' Oh , Jonathan , the Germans were not responsible for World War Two . ' " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when Lowell was offered up as a candidate for the Professorship of Poetry at Oxford , W. H. Auden wrote in a letter that he backed his candidacy but felt that his other supporters ought to be aware that " Cal has times when he has to go into the bin . " The warning signals ? " a ) He announces that he is the only living poet , b ) a romantic and 54 usually platonic attraction to a young girl and c ) he gives a huge party . " ( Lowell 's feverish identification with tyrants past made for a fourth . ) Even the specter of suicide became a source of grim amusement . After Lowell 's friend and fellow poet John Berryman leapt to his death from a bridge in 1972 , the newspapers reported that Berryman did n't leave behind a suicide note . " A malicious joke ( said by many to have originated with Auden ) was that Berryman did leave a note . It read simply : ' Your move , Cal . ' " B UT UNDER the wisecracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was true distress , true anguish . The most painful pages in Robert Lowell are those that doc-ument Lowell 's physical and poeti-the women who kept weaving borders . On Christmas Day , 1938 , Lowell and his bride-to-be , Jean Stafford , were involved in a car crash in which Stafford 's nose was " crushed " and her face disfigured . The horrific details of the effort to repair Stafford 's nose are given in her famous story " The Interior Castle , " in which her protagonist , Pansy , scales a nightmarish winding stair of suffering : " Watching the surgeon ' , Pansy could already feel the prongs of his pliers opening her nostrils for the insertion of his fine probers . " Considering the flaming-nerved hell such operations put Stafford through , it 's a shock to learn in Hamilton 's book that a few years later during a quarrel Lowell struck Stafford full in the face and broke her nose again . " The nose which had been carefully repaired was broken again , " says Frank Parker , who was there on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repairing the nose , after the awful time she 'd had getting it repaired in the first place . " Did he do it ? Hamilton asks . It was n't just Jean saying he did ? " No , Cal said he really did hit her and he felt the nose go and everything . . .. " Punishment of a different sort was dished out to Lowell 's second wife , the novelist and critic Elizabeth Hardwick . Not only did Low-ell 's infidelities become the common buzz of gossip in New York and London literary circles , but he even stooped to spicing his poems with indiscreet sentences lifted from Hardwick 's correspondence . When The Dolphin and For Lizzie and Harriet were published , Adrienne Rich fumed in the American Poetry Review : " Finally , what does one say about a poet who , having left his wife and daughter for another marriage in 1972 , Lowell married Lady Caroline Blackwood , then titles a book with their names , and goes on to appropriate his ex-wife 's letters written under the stress and pain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new wife ? " Certainly it seems in dubious taste to include in a volume dedicated to one 's daughter and former wife a poem that goes on swoonily about a student who shared the poet 's bed : " . .. should n't I ask to hold to you forever , /body of a dolphin , breast of cloud ? /You rival the renewal of the day , /clearing the puddles with your green sack of books . " The cloud-breasted student later followed Lowell to England , land of many puddles , and left when the vacillations of Lowell 's affections led to burdensome exhaustion . As for Hardwick , the exhausting strain on her nerves can barely be imagined . After all this fussing back and forth across the Atlantic , Lowell comforted himself with the knowledge that many English reviewers ( unlike their insulting American cousins ) compared The Dolphin with Yeats 's last poems ? a comparison that I suspect future critics will regard as more kind than just . But then perhaps my own exhaustion with Robert Lowell and Robert Lowell is curdling my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt achy and scuffed , as if Lowell himself had been digging his heels in my ribs . 55 The breakdowns , the tantrums , the bruised feelings , the needling slights , the slosh of booze and the gulp of sedatives ? the furies feasting on Robert Lowell 's innards are all fully documented by the diligent Hamilton , but , finally , what is all this for ? Gossip-avid as I am , I really am tired of reading about American poets courting suicide and dunking their heads into the punch bowl as prim faculty wives look aghast . Eileen Simpson 's recent memoir Poets in Their Youth had its share of punch-bowl antics , but it also was buoyed with a tender respect for the strivings of Berryman ( her former husband ) , Lowell , Jarrell , and Blackmur as poets ? they were n't merely neuros busting up the furniture . Ian Hamilton 's biography of Lowell is n't a serrated sawing-away at Lowell 's reputation in the tradition of Lawrance Thompson 's book on Robert Frost or T. S. Matthews 's long sneer at T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crassly attempted to lift the sheets in Eliot 's bedroom : " Did he masturbate ? Of course . And was he ashamed of it ? Unspeakably. " ) , but it is a curiously dour , dogged , and conscientiously chill effort , a book that buries its subject under a heap of clutter . Undoubtedly other reviewers of Robert Lowell will advise readers to delve into Lowell 's poetry to take his true measure as a writer ? that the untidy lurches of Lowell 's life should n't serve as a distraction or impediment . Pretty sentiments , but the truth is that after reading Robert Lowell you really do n't want to crack open the poems ? you ca n't wait to comb Robert Lowell and his distresses out of your head . p ERLIAPS Robert Lowell reads like a chore because re-searching the book proved a laborious chore for Ham-ilton , and he 's simply passing his fatigue on like a baton . ( The only break in the glum cataloguing of de-tail comes when Hamilton quotes from Norman Mailer and Jean Staf-ford ? their writing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sluggish soiree . ) It certainly ca n't be said that Hamilton 's esteem for Lowell as a poet burns with a high tongue of flame , He complains of " the limp translatorese " that gives Imitations its wilt , applauds Rolfe Humphries 's " refreshingly plainspoken " dismissal of The Mills of the Kavanaughs , and says of the plays that make up The Old Glory , " to call them ' poetic ' is charitable , since they are mostly written in ambling prose .... " It is n't that Hamilton is necessarily wrong in his appraisals , just that if enthusiasm for Lowell 's work runs so thinly in his blood , then why do the book at all ? Why not leave the spadework to someone who would more vigorously cherish the task ? Perhaps Hamilton was seduced by the notion of making a stamp on his time with a major biography . Robert Lowell , after all , was not only a writer of immense gifts and intelligence , but he had the look of a Great Poet ? the shambling height , the brooding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliance in the eyes . And a Great Poet deserves a Great Biography , a sturdy monument where pigeons can convene . But though Hamilton says commending things about Lowell and his work , and ends his biography with a citation from King Lear ( " We that are young/Shall never see so much , nor live so long " ) , you finally do n't believe that Hamilton believes that Lowell was a figure of greatness . Instead , Lowell emerges as an unholy handful Hamilton can hardly wait to lateral into our laps . After the personal , newsy jottings of Notebook and Day by Day , Low-ell 's reputation took a dip , and it 's unlikely that Hamilton 's biography will do much to spur fresh enthusiasm . In the literary quarterly Salmagundi ( Spring ? Summer 1979 ) , Charles Molesworth makes a spirited case for the " snapshot " pieceiness of Lowell 's last poems , saying that they settle for a " redemptive factuality . " But for a poet who longed for Miltonic elevation , the scrapbook ruminations of those later works can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , come to mean little to those outside an intimate circle of associates ; they belong in a drawer , not on a museum mural . Which is not to say that Lowell 's career was a failure , that the best poems of Lord Weary 's Castle and Life Studies wo n't stand long after all the nutsy hubbub in Lowell 's life has cooled to ash . But reading Robert Lowell , you ca n't but feel that the derailments caused by his madness kept him off the highest slopes and made him instead one of our most treasured , distinguished minor classics . Perhaps the next to last word should go to a poet Lowell highly ( and rightly ) admired , Philip Larkin . In a recent interview , Larkin was asked about the cult of madness in poetry and replied , " There certainly is a cult of the mad these days : think of all the boys who 've been in the bin ? I do n't understand it . Chaucer , Shakespeare , Wordsworth , Hardy ? it 's the big , sane boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those medals no closer to grasp .
