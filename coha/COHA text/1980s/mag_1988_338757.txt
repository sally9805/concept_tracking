After spending 14 months and $1.7 million investigating Edwin Meese , Independent Counsel James McKay last week offered the outgoing Attorney General one small consolation : he will not be prosecuted for violating any of the laws he had been entrusted to enforce . But far from the " vindication " that Meese had confidently predicted , McKay 's 830-page report asserts that Ronald Reagan 's longtime friend " willfully " filed a false tax return and " probably " violated conflict-of-interest laws . If Meese 's legal troubles are behind him , his ethical behavior remains troubling . <P> Meese was outraged that McKay would accuse him of unlawful conduct without giving him his day in court to rebut the charges . Meese termed McKay 's tactics " absolutely at odds with every principle of our system of justice " and said he would fire any prosecutor in his department who promoted such " a false implication of wrongdoing . " <P> McKay explained , however , that unlike other prosecutors , he was required by the 1978 independent-counsel law to explain his findings publicly , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a law , he said , are not prosecuted unless they have a clear criminal intent . McKay said he had found none in the case of the Attorney General , and although he considered the deterrent value of such a highly visible indictment , he had decided not to treat Meese as a special case . Said McKay : " It was a real tough decision  --  what message is this going to send out to the public ? " McKay 's major findings : <P> Taxes . Meese failed to report his capital gains from the June 1985 sale of $54,581 in stocks . When Meese could not locate the records to figure the capital gain , his accountant filed a tax return without disclosing the sale . Last February Meese finally filed an amended return , citing a profit of $14,606 ( understating it by more than $6,000 , according to McKay ) . Meese " probably " broke two tax laws by filing a false return and " failing to pay his income tax when due . " <P> Baby Bells . Meese also " probably " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could have enhanced the value of the stock he held in regional Bell Telephone companies . Although Meese had tried to transfer the shares to a financial adviser , he did not actually sell them and continued to get dividend checks . But he did not cash them , and McKay found no evidence that Meese sought to profit from the Justice Department deliberations . <P> The Iraqi pipeline . At the instigation of his friend and attorney E. Robert Wallach , Meese helped promote U.S. and Israeli guarantees for a proposed pipeline that would allow Iraqi oil to bypass the Persian Gulf . Wallach told Meese the plan included a proposal to pay off Israel 's Labor Party so that Israel would not sabotage the project . " If an illegal bribery scheme actually was afoot , Mr. Meese 's actions would have furthered the scheme , " said McKay . But some participants refused to be questioned , and there was insufficient evidence that a bribe plot existed . Thus McKay did not charge Meese with aiding it .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
