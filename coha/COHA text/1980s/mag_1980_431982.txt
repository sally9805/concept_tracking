 | T he face is beautiful but anguished , haunted by sorrow , despair , determination and love . Can one face express all these warring emotions , with a grave dignity that adds a deeper beauty to the physical structure ? Meryl Streep 's face can and does in the extraordinary first image of KRAMER Vs . KRAMER . This first shot of a superbly crafted film prints indelibly upon the eyes and consciousness of the audience the face of a young actress who , at 30 , may become the strongest performer of her generation , the first American woman since Jane Fonda to rival the power , versatility and impact of such male stars as Dustin Hoffman , Jack Nicholson , Robert De Niro and Al Pacino . Hoffman plays the male lead in Robert Benton 's moving film about the struggle of a divorced couple for custody of their 6-yearold son . And the instant success of " Kramer Vs . Kramer " is due largely to the superb performances of Hoffman and Streep , who have already been cited by both the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best supporting actress . They seem to be odds-on favorites to win Academy Awards , as does the film itself , which was voted best picture by both critics ' groups . The supporting-actress category is in a sense a technicality . Hoffman and Streep are the antagonists in " Kramer Vs . Kramer , " although the film 's boldly effective dramatic structure focuses on Streep at the beginning and in the latter part , while Hoffman dominates the middle . The compelling face in that first shot belongs to Joanna Kramer who , driven by an inner crisis of identity , is leaving her husband Ted and son Billy . Although most people will have a built-in aversion to the sight of a woman abandoning her child , the complexity , clarity and power of Streep 's acting forestalls that reaction . Writer-director Benton cuts instantly to the nerve of the matter , forsaking plot exposition for the stark , electric fact of a marriage suddenly breaking up , to the amazement and confusion of Ted , who has n't had a clue that anything is wrong . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ted , and this is one of the great merits of the film . What 's wrong is the marriage itself and the forces , both social and psychological , that have made aberrant human beings out of both husband and wife . Ted Kramer is a hot-shot advertising man on his way up in a business that demands an appalling dedication of energy and time . " It 's 25 hours a day , eight days a week , " he tells his boss , who 's just handed him a promotion . From " The Hucksters " on , we 've seen this world again and again in films , but never with such sharpness of detail and tragicomic force . In a beautifully paced crescendo of scenes , we now watch the funny and appalling spectacle of Ted trying to fulfill the imperatives of Madison Avenue and bring up his son at the same time . The acting of Hoffman , and little Justin Henry as Billy is screen acting at its best , beginning with a hilarious but devastating breakfast scene in which Ted 's attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself on with a play-by-play commentary , results in a clattering , splattering chaos . This is a movie about change , and there 's a real excitement in watching the decent , frazzled Ted try to become a double parent to his little boy . It 's impossible not to be moved as their relationship passes through one crisis after another . In a marvelously played pivotal scene , Billy challenges Ted 's authority by passing up his dinner to eat chocolate-chip ice cream . The resulting explosion leads to a deeper understanding between father and son . If it sounds cornt it 's not : Benton is able to get a deep human resonance out of the most mundane domestic details . What we 're watching is an initiation rite : nearly 40 , Ted Kramer is growing up . Some critics have caviled that Ted is too good to be true , but " Kramer Vs . Kramer " wants to show how decency can struggle to fruition under grievous pressure , and why should n't we welcome such an intelliegent and sensitive attempt to shape such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decency that the world seems to flaunt every day has gotten to be a damnable bore : Ted and Billy 's struggle toward a by no means simple love is n't sentimental ; it 's kind of thrilling . We can believe Ted 's growing insight , achieved by the free exercise of his intelligence , into Joanna 's problem . Trying to explain her absence to Billy , he says : " I tried to make her a certain kind of person . . . I would n't listen ... Just because I was happy I thought that meant she was happy , too . " Ted 's good faith is tested when Joanna returns after eighteen months to claim cus-@#  | tody of Billy . In the climactic courtroom sequence , the film finally becomes Kramer vs . Kramer . The masterstroke is to show the adversary relationship as complicated by the new feelings of understanding and compassion the now divorced pair have for each other . As their lawyers examine and cross-examine , trying to break down the character of both parties , Ted and Joanna try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight for the child . In evoking the absurdity and pain of this double bind , the acting of Hoffman and Streep reaches a peak of emotional power and an orchestration of detail that from any point of view must be seen as masterly . Some have called the writing slick and soap-operatic . But actually the screenplay , a collaborative venture in which Benton 's script , based on Avery Corman 's novel , was altered significantly by both Hoffman and Streep , is an excellent example of shrewdly simple means that succeed in touching hearts , minds and nerves . Tears will very likely well up in you : notice how well-earned they are , and notice that the writing is a kind of choreographic " score " that 's embodied with grace and power by Hoffman and Streep . There are many wonderfully effective scenes : Ted racing Billy to the hospital after a playground fall and comforting him as he receives hairraisingly real stitches near his eye ; Ted saying with supernal sorrow , " Shame on you , ' when his boss fires him a lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jobeth Williams ) whom Ted has just slept with encounters Billy on her way , naked , to the bathroom . Williams 's adorable comic embarrassment typifies the work of a superb supporting cast : Jane Alexander as a neighbor who tries to be a friend to both Ted and Joanna ; George Coe as the heartless boss ; Howard Duff as Ted 's lawyer ? a marvelous vignette of a florid , elegant , hard-drinking Irishman who has both true tenderness and a courtroom killer instinct . Because " Kramer Vs . Kramer " hits so close to home , people care about its " truth " in a personal way . Lawyers and judges specializing in child-custody cases were interviewed by The New York Times and found the movie 's custody trial unrealistic : in the film , the judge does n't interview the child ; he does n't appoint a psychiatrist or neutral expert . In Ms. magazine , which can be taken to reflect mainstream feminism , Barbara Grizzuti Harrison wrote that she " rooted for the father , laughing and crying all the way , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way " not immediately easy to analyze " by the filmmakers . Some critics have wondered why Ted never gets a baby-sitter or housekeeper . Benton actually filmed some scenes showing Ted interviewing housekeepers , but did n't like them and simply cut them . This may sound cavalier , but essentially Benton was right . These details are at worst minor flaws . " Kramer Vs . Kramer " is really about two middle-class people who find that they are trapped in false lives and try to relearn their humanity . It 's the emotional texture of the film that 's important , and that registers superbly , thanks chiefly to the inspired acting of its leads . Even the legal experts cited in the Times admired " the beauty of Meryl Streep 's performance . " That makes it unanimous . In only her fifth film , Streep has made a stunning impact on audiences and on her fellow professionals . Last year she won an Oscar nomination for her role in " The Deer Hunter " as the steel-town girlfriend of one of the soldiers who goes off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has graced three films : in Woody Allen 's " Manhattan , " she played Woody 's ex-wife who 's become a lesbian ; in " The Seduction of Joe Tynan , " she played opposite Alan Aida as the tough-minded attorney having an affair with a married senator who 's running for President . And now " Kramer . " With her striking , offbeat blond beauty , her extensive stage background , which reaches from Shakespeare to Chekhov to the leading young American playwrights , Streep has impressed just about everyone as something new among recent American actresses , a combination of sensuous appeal and high intelligence that seems almost too good to be true . With Streep , thinking and feeling are locked in a perpetual embrace . When she was working on the character of Joanna , she hung around the play-@#  | grounds of New York 's Upper East Side , watching the young mothers with their children while their husbands were at work . " The more I thought about it , " she says , " the more I felt the sensual reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are n't attached to logic . Joanna 's daddy took care of her . Her college took care of her . Then Ted took care of her . Suddenly she just felt incapable of caring for herself . " Streep 's insight into Joanna is a feeling for someone the exact opposite of herself . " I wanted to play a woman who had this feeling of incapability , because I 've always felt that I can do anything . " There 's no arrogance when Meryl says this ? only a bemused irony at the confidence and good fortune that have always attended her . But those who work with her say the same thing , and there 's no irony , only amazement . Jerry Schatzberg , who directed Streep in " The Seduction of Joe Tynan , " says , " She is going to be the next major American actress to be offered everything . She can do anything she wants to . " " I think I have a romantic concept of Meryl , " says Robert Benton . " I have supreme faith in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first choice for the role of Joanna Kramer was n't Streep but Kate Jackson , the former Charlie 's Angel . Meryl was interviewed for the two-scene role of Phyllis , Ted Kramer 's one-night stand who bumps into Billy in the buff . Benton , Hoffman and producer Stanley Jaffe met her at a New York hotel . When she left , Hoffman and Benton looked at each other and said , " She 's perfect . She is Joanna . " Although Benton , Hoffman and Jaffe knew Streep 's stage work , she was hardly a major movie figure , with " The Deer Hunter " and " Joe Tynan " finished but not yet released . Still , Meryl had strong ideas about reshaping Joanna so she would be a rnore sympathetic character . Dissatisfied with Joanna 's long courtroom speech , Benton suggested that she rewrite it ? and promptly forgot the suggestion . When he started filming the courtroom scene , Meryl arrived with the speech she had rewritten . " I thought , oh my God , " recalls Benton , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One , rewriting what she 's done , and the other soothing her wounded feelings . Well , her scene was brilliant . I cut only two lines . What you see there is hers . " Watching Meryl in that scene , says Benton , " it was as though someone set off an enormous bomb . Meryl devastated us . We shot her testimony in eight or ten takes ? close-up , medium shot , long shot . She stayed at that same level all day long . We even did one take with the camera on Dustin for his reaction . The whole crew had its back to Meryl . When it was finished , we turned around and there was Meryl in tears . She 'd given it that much all over again , and just for a reaction shot . " Hoffman , who has been known to be difficult on a set , got along well with Streep except during the restaurant scene where she announces she will seek custody of the boy . Meryl wanted to break the news late in the conversation instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While time and money melted away , Hoffman and Streep argued . " I hated her guts , " recalls Hoffman . " But I respected her . She 's ultimately not fighting for herself , but for the scene . She sticks with her guns and does n't let anyone mess with her when she thinks she 's NEWSWEEK/JANUARY1  | right . " The scene was rewritten Meryl 's way . Now Hoffman sounds just as smitten with her as Benton . " She 'll work twenty hours a day , " he says . " She 's an ox when it comes to acting . She eats work for breakfast . " But the ox can move . " I loved acting with her . It 's like playing with Billie Jean King . She keeps trying to hit the perfect ball . And , " he adds , " although it sounds chauvinistic , Meryl is never at the mirror between shots , like a lot of actresses are . She 's in the script , she 's in your ear , saying Why do n't we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to check her face . " The early Meryl Streep was much more narcissistic . Born Mary Louise Streep ( the name is of Dutch origin ) in a middle-class suburb in New Jersey , she was called Meryl from birth by her mother , who simply liked the name . Meryl traces her development from an " ugly little kid with a big mouth , an obnoxious showoff " who bossed her two younger brothers around , to a bright kid who was good at almost anything but serious about nothing . Certainly not about the theater. and not about singing , even though at 12 she had a beautiful voice and was a protogee of Estelle Liebling , the celebrated teacher of Beverly Sills , among others . After a brief but feverish outburst of conventionality in high school , where she became a cheerleader and plunged " very heavy into the boyfriend scene , " she went on to Vassar , where she resumed her activities as a " jack-of-all-trades , master of none . " She even resisted the counter-culture fever of the ' 60s , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was turned off by the big anti-this , pro-that campus bonfire rallies , most of which were led by the men students who were then making Vasser coed . " I saw people who , in class , had given interesting opinions on important things caught up in this mass hysteria , a mad glaze over their eves . I know how powerfully theater can move people and that this was essentially theater ? but the wrong kind . " So Meryl got into the right kind at Vassar , winning the lead in Strindberg 's " Miss Julie " from more experienced actresses and collecting raves . Miss Julie " was not only the first serious thing Streep did as an actress , it was the first serious play she had ever seen . She thought it was great fun , but " still did n't want to be an actress . I still did n't think it was a legitimate way to carry on our life . " Spending part of her senior year in a theater program at Dartmouth did n't change her mind , nor did a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring Chekhov to local snow bunnies at the ski resorts . Then she applied to two distinguished professional schools , Juilliard and the Yale School of Drama . application had this very uppity , expensive Yale 's application was $15 and I was mak- ing $48 a week . So I wrote Juilliard a snotty letter saying this just shows what kind of cross-section of the population you get at your school . I applied to Yale and I got in and they gave me a scholarship . " At Yale she became something of a legend . In three years she played about 40 parts , everything from the Salvation Army lass in the Brecht-Weill musical " Happy End " to a young lover in " A Midsummer Night 's Dream " to a decayed ancient in " The Idiots Karamazov , " a madcap burlesque by two bright and brash young playwrights , Albert Innaurato and Christopher Durang . This was the most schizophrenic phase of her life . Under Robert Brustein , Yale had developed a powerful training program and a venturesome repertory theater , but Streep still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absurdity " of theater as a way of life . She did n't like being whipsawed by a constant barrage of master teachers , each of whom would preach the one true way until he 'd be fired and another guru would come in . " That kind of grab-bag , eclectic education is invaluable , " says Streep , " but out of adversity . Half the time you 're thinking I would n't do it that way , this guy is full of crap , but in a way , that 's how you build up what you do believe in . " What she did like was " the fun of it , the collective electricity . That was a secret that none of them with all their methods could take away from me . " Streep 's idea of fun was pure creativity . Joe Grifasi , a gifted comic actor who was a fellow Yale student , remembers one time when an actor missed a cue and Meryl was left alone onstage for several minutes . " The setting was a psychiatrist 's office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking up objects and finally peering intently at the Rorschach inkblot pictures on the wall . Then she looked at the audience as if she had discovered a major flaw in her character and burst into tears . " This instant creativity was instantly noticed by Joseph Papp who , after her graduation from Yale , hired Streep to play a small part in Pinero 's late Victorian comedy , " Trelawny of the Wells ' . " Papp flatly calls her the most remarkable actress that he 's had at the Public Theater . " There are only a few people around I would call pure actors , " he says . " Meryl is one . That means that the entire body is an instrument that is used constantly to serve a particular character . You can see it in her face . I 've seen her cheeks get red , so that you can see the internal thing through her skin , which means that there 's a total emotional involvement in the situation . And she takes tremendous risks , both physical and emotional . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she threw herself on the floor playing Kate in The Taming of the Shrew . ' And there are certain actors who would @# 55  | never play a negative role because they fear that the audience would not like them . But Meryl does n't care and she violates her classic beauty constantly . " There are those who are put off by all this adulation of an actress who 's had such a short career in the public eye . Three years at Yale , three more acting in the Northeast area at theaters like Papp 's New York Shakespeare Festival , Arvin Brown 's Long Wharf Theater in New Haven , the Phoenix Theatre in New York , a couple of TV shows , notably her Emmy-winning per formance as a Catholic married to a Jew in " Holocaust , " five movies ? what is there about Streep that triggers such uni versal admiration ? And where is her hidden flaw ? People sense there 's something new about Streep . There 's a sense of mystery in her acting ; she does n't simply imitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She trans mits a sense of danger , a primal unease lying just below the surface of normal behavior . A Streep character is n't quite sure who she is or exactly what she 's doing just like you and me . She 's less ingratiating than Jill Clayburgh , less self-satis fled than the recent Jane Fonda ( not Fonda of " Klute " ) . And unlike the Great Bimbos of the ' 70s , the Farrahs and Suzannes , her beauty has nothing to do with the yearning smirks of male fantasy . Farrah smiles like a plastic nutcracker ; Streep smiles like destiny . As for her hidden flaw , well , it seems to be hidden pretty well . " I ca n't think of anything bad to say about Meryl , " says James With lit Woods , her co-star in " Holocaust , " " and I love to say bad things about people . " Nothing bad , but sorrow , yes . Meryl lived with John Cazale ( the fine young actor remembered by most people for his por trayal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) until his tragic death of cancer in 1978 . A few weeks later she had to film " The Seduction of Joe Tynan . " The actor John Lithgow recalls that she had to do a love scene in bed with Alan Alda . " It 's a scene that demands tremendous high spir its and a great deal of sexual energy , " says Lithgow , " and at that time , right after John Cazale had died , Meryl was in no mood for either . And she was embarrassed by the scene . She said she would perspire until she was dripping wet from embarrassment . " Alda remembers the incident as an ordeal for Meryl . " She looked at the movie , " he says , " as some kind of test , a test she had to pass . She was determined not to buckle . " The man who helped her through this difficult time was Don Gummer , a 32-year old sculptor who was a friend of Meryl 's brother Harry III , who is a modern dancer NEWS , 56 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don were married in September 1978 , and this past November she had her first child , Henry . They live in Don 's loft on lower Broadway , modest premises for the coming star of the ' 80s , but just right for Mr. and Mrs. Don Gummer . They do n't travel in the febrile , vampirefanged purlieus of showbiz ; most of their friends are young artists or actors . The Gummers send forth waves of sanity and happiness . He is a strong , quiet type whose open , ordered , geometric sculpture reflects those qualities . Each has benefited from contact with the other 's art . " She 's learned how to look at objects and I 've learned how to look at people , " says Gummer . Understandably sensitive about being married to a potential superstar , he has no fears for their relationship . " There are many different levels of love , " he says . " Ours is founded on a very deep-rooted feeling of trust . We 're best friends . " Streep has entered the crucial phase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering around her . Producers like Alan Ladd Jr . and Allan Carr rate Streep in the $350,000-$400,000 category right now , not " bankable " like a Streisand or an Eastwood . But , says Carr , " She 's a bargain in comparison to other actresses who get a million and do n't draw any more than she does . Any leading man looks better by being with her . She gives any ordinary picture a major stature . " This is the bottom-line talk of gimleteyed moneymen . Streep is determined to resist their blandishments ; she does n't want to give ordinary pictures major stature ; she wants to do serious and exciting work . She wants to be a screen actress , a stage performer , a wife , a mother and anything else that will bring together life and art in a civilized fashion . Because of her beauty she 's constantly brushing aside feelers for movies like " Sidney Sheldon 's Bloodline. " or Judith Krantz 's Sheldonoid , " Scruples . " On the other hand , she was eager to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Postman Always Rings Twice , " which has a promising screenplay by playwright David Mamet and some explicit sex . Streep was willing to play the sex scenes as long as co-star Jack Nicholson would be as visibly explicit as she . The producers gave the part to Jessica Lange . Can a stunning , smart , serious young actress who can play everything from Shakespeare to knockabout farce find success in the chrome-plated Disposall known as the movie industry ? Michael Cimino , who directed Streep in " The Deer Hunter , " thinks she 's going to be a dominant figure of the ' 80s . Dustin Hoffman says , " She has an incredible piece of working life ahead of her . She 's going to be the Eleanor Roosevelt of acting . " B ut Joe Papp is worried . " Hollywood , " he says , " looks for a quality and they try to exploit that quality . You ca n't do that with her because she has too many variables ? you ca n't stamp out cookies with Meryl . I just hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movies , which are still a male medium . I have a feeling she 's going to run into a lot of frustration Meryl is still an oddball in the movie industry , no matter how interesting and complex she is . She 's too good an actress , and I do n't think she can compromise even if she wanted to . That 's the greatest saving grace she has . " Streep says : " I feel pulled in a lot of different directions but I have n't shattered yet . I feel that I 've made commitments professionally , to my marriage , to my baby , to the community . " By community she means " the community of souls whatever we all are collectively . " She says things like that the way other people talk about the kitchen sink . For her such things are the kitchen sink , they 're reality . " Everyone should put their life on the line according to their art , because everything else is easy , " she says . " Zero Mostel , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line for comedy , for making people laugh . I see myself acting forever and even and ever . But I 'm not interested in lazy drama or lazy movies that say Well , let 's just go this high ; OK , we got that high , people will love it ' . " How high will Meryl Streep go ? @#
