 | How bad is the world debt problem ? Bad enough that the leaders of Western democracies all but threw up their hands at the Paris economic summit last weekend and stopped pretending that a viable solution is at hand to defuse the $1.3 trillion debt bomb . After two decades of profligate lending ? first to Eastern European nations that squandered $70 billion in Western loans , then to Latin America , where billions of dollars passed through these countries into the private accounts of corrupt officials ? the creditor nations now find themselves at a crossroad . Hard choices must be made about who deserves to get a fresh start and who does not . President Bush made clear last week during his trip to Poland and Hungary that he would rather focus on encouraging change in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union , furthering the EastWest rapprochement , than engage in a comprehensive new effort aimed at poorer nations in Latin America and Africa . Yet that is where the worst problems are and where it looks like already fragile infrastructures could collapse unless these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounder footing . The most visible sign of woe was the inability of Mexico and its banks , after months of haggling , to reach a debtrestructuring agreement prior to the end of the summit . The Bush administration had desperately wanted such a deal to show that its new strategy to significantly ease debtors ' burdens could work and said more than $1 billion in interim financing could be raised to clinch an agreement . Now , its best efforts have come to naught , and the Western Alliance faces either a prolonged period of stasis or a crisis that could bring the international finance system to its knees . Try as it might to put the best face on the situation , the fact is that the world 's banking system , after seven years , remains hostage to a score of debtor nations who have missed out on years of global growth . More and more economists and foreigners are saying there might be no solution to the problem short of a moratorium on debt payments similar to the situation in the 1930s . " We 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said economist Rudiger Dornbusch of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , an adviser to the Mexican government . " Debtors will have to try to grow and fix their economies while the creditors lick their wounds . " Although a number of major U.S. banks have already written off considerable portions of their loans to Latin American countries , a unilateral moratorium might wipe out the entire capital of a handful of big institutions and severely cripple others unless the government changes the way these losses have to be assessed . If the rules are changed and the banks are given tax breaks to survive , then U.S. taxpayers might have to bear these huge expenses .  | For the U.S. , financial issues swirling around the developing world 's $1.3 trillion debt burden are intertwined with politics . That is because many of the most troubled debtors are Third World nations like Mexico , Argentina and the Philippines that desperately are attempting to maintain fragile democratic institutions and Second World nations like Poland and Hungary that are trying to move from Marxism toward democratic systems and market economies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard pressed itself to come up with the kind of massive assistance many of the indebted nations need . Like any banker , the administration must decide which nations and which democratic and market-oriented reforms most deserve nurturing , because the U.S. can not do it all and its bankers have been burned badly in their zeal to flood developing countries with loans . That is why the decision last week to focus on the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe is so important . " These are opportunities that ought not to be let go by and really call for concerted action , " argued White House Chief of Staff John Sununu . Bush began the romancing of the East bloc during emotional , whirlwind trips through Poland and Hungary . He promised only modest amounts of seed money at first ? $115 million to Poland and $25 million to Hungary ? which disappointed the recipients . " It speaks of millions when we need billions , " complained the proSolidarity paper Gazeta Wyborcza in Poland . Solidarity leader Lech Walesa had asked Bush for $10 billion . Still , White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of a longterm campaign to pump much more Western help into the reform-minded nations . And they vowed not to repeat the mistakes of the 1970s when vast sums were loaned to both nations without requiring changes in their economies . Drop in the bucket . That is where the allies enter the picture . Bush walked into the summit pursuing accords for significant allied assistance to Eastern Europe and other struggling nations . Japanese Prime Minister Sousuke Uno agreed to tap his country 's bulging surpluses by committing $10 billion to support Bush 's debt-reduction plan and an additional $28 billion for other international aid programs , which also solidified Japan 's position as the world 's emerging rich uncle . While this may sound like a lot of money , it is a drop in the bucket considering the amounts now owed , let alone the need for new capital to spur growth in developing nations . Those issues were most clearly in focus in the negotiations between Mexico and its U.S. bankers . For months , the government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brady Plan . Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady recognized in  | March that international debt levels were dangerous and could not be reduced simply by economic growth as Brady 's predecessor , James Baker , had argued . Brady for the first time called on U.S. banks to reduce chunks of their debt in return for guarantees by international agencies that the remaining debt would be covered . The Bush administration also wanted the Mexican negotiations to succeed because Salinas is exactly the kind of believer in free markets and political reform that Western leaders should be trying to help . Moreover , Mexico had a solid record of good-faith efforts to keep up its debt payments . The fundamental flaw of the Brady Plan is that it raised expectations that the write-offs would bear some relation to the discounted market value of the loans . Mexico 's debt , for example , trades at about 60 percent of its face value . So Mexico hoped to get under the Brady Plan a debt reduction from U.S. banks of close to 40 percent . However , banks were given no incentive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the most part , are being repaid , though the payments are occasionally late . In the Mexican negotiations , it is purely up to each bank to decide whether to grant any write-offs . They also have the option of reducing interest rates or of lending new money and piling the debt higher . " Cosmetic " at best . Thus , it is not at all surprising that many banks have eschewed the write-off option in the Mexican negotiations . Sources close to the talks say that even if an agreement is reached the upshot is that Mexico 's debts will be bigger than ever , although it will get some cash-flow relief . As the Paris summit convened , Brady staunchly insisted that the Mexican talks were still on track , but experts believe that a final agreement will not achieve much real debt reduction . " There may yet be a cosmetic settlement to make everybody feel good after wrestling in the mud for so long , " says economist Dornbusch , who predicts the seven-year problem over debt relief will continue to fester . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is gaining currency . Unless a struggling nation deals with its fundamental economic problems by cutting inflation and stemming the flight of funds , reduction of its debt burden will not help much . For all the lip service paid to the Brady Plan at the summit , the dawning lesson is that debt reduction alone will not help fundamentally sick economies . The underlying message of the problems in Paris is that the debtors have to clean up their own act before creditors will be willing to take the plunge again .
