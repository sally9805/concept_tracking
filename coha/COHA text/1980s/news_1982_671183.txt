HOW some Nazi war criminals and collaborators were able to make their way to the United States after World War II , attain citizenship and live undetected or unmolested is a question that has long troubled scholars and Holocaust survivors . In recent years , Congress , too , has demanded explanations. // Now , John Loftus , a former member of the Justice Department unit that investigated alleged Nazi war criminals in the United States , offers a comprehensive answer . It is an ugly one . Nazi war criminals , he charges , got into this country because they were invited in , sometimes smuggled in . By whom ? The State Department ' s intelligence chief . Why ? To help fight Communism. // The author bases his claims , which he first made earlier this year on the television program " 60 Minutes , " in part on classified files he reviewed while serving for two-and-a-half years with the Office of Special Investigations . Indeed , he declares , he submitted his manuscript to intelligence agencies for clearance and agreed to delete a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no way of verifying his assertions . That objection is valid in some instances ; but enough material is quoted from public archives to build a persuasive case , although Mr. Loftus mars his account with some inaccuracies and overstatements. // The Belarus of the title is Byelorussia , also called White Russia and White Ruthenia , an ancient land between Poland and Russia . When Hitler turned on Russia in 1941 , Soviet Byelorussia was the road to Moscow and it was to become an early proving ground for the SS Einsatzgruppen , the mobile killing squads . The Belarus Brigade was a Byelorussian unit incorporated into a German SS division . What Mr. Loftus calls " the Belarus secret " is that many of this brigade ' s leaders , including war criminals , were assisted into the United States after the war. // Drawing on secret immigration and intelligence files , he contends , for example , that Radislaw Ostrowsky , president of a Nazi-installed Byelorussian puppet government , was secretly admitted into the United States from Argentina and lived quietly in Benton Harbor , Mich. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1976 ( not 1979 as the text says ) . Mr. Loftus calls Ostrowsky " the highest-ranking Nazi war criminal to enter this country " - an arguable point . Admitting Ostrowsky into the United States was no oversight , Mr. Loftus contends . Ostrowsky ' s immigration file showed that the United States Government was fully informed about his wartime service for the Nazis when he was naturalized as a citizen in Michigan in 1972. // Nor was the Ostrowsky case unique , Mr. Loftus maintains . There was Franz Kushel , chief of the Nazi-controlled Byelorussian police that rounded up the Jews of Minsk for execution by the Einsatzgruppen . There was Stanislaw Stankievich , mayor of Nazi-occupied Borissow , where 7 , 000 Jewish men , women and children were forced into pre-dug mass graves and shot to death on Oct. 20 , 1941 . There was Emanuel Jasiuk , another Nazi-installed functionary in Kletsk , where 5 , 000 Jews were slaughtered . Together with Ostrowsky and other leaders of the Byelorussian Central Council , these three were admitted into the United States - thanks largely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wisner , a New York lawyer and a former State Department intelligence chief and Central Intelligence Agency official who shot himself to death in Maryland in 1965 at the age of 56. // The book portrays Mr. Wisner , the first director of the Government ' s innocuous-sounding Office of Policy Coordination , as a chauvinistic swashbuckler who defied President Truman ' s orders against admitting Nazi war criminals into this country . Citing recently discovered " top secret White House documents " and the recollections of a former Truman aide , Clark Clifford , Mr. Loftus asserts that Mr. Truman remained under the impression that no American agency brought Nazi war criminals into the country . The reality , however , was something else , Mr. Loftus asserts. // While the Army ' s Counter-Intelligence Corps is depicted as ably carrying out the monumental task of screening the hundreds of thousands of displaced persons for concealed war criminals , Mr. Wisner ' s office is described as actively seeking the very same Nazis for service in a secret anti-Communist force that was recruited to foment unrest behind the Iron Curtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Loftus maintains , was that many of his Nazi double agents were Soviet triple agents , so most of the American operations were compromised from the start. // Mr. Loftus asserts that a cover-up of the Nazi recruitment operations is still continuing by a circle of former Wisner operatives " who know how to protect their key informants ( and themselves ) , " that intelligence files on Nazi smuggling operations have been sanitized by an ultrasecret unit at Fort Meade , Md. - that the author says he was only permitted to identify by its initials , S.O.D. - and that even now , " without the assent or knowledge of the present members of Congress , intelligence agencies are believed to be smuggling a modern band of ' war criminals ' into the United States . " The context and other hints dropped by Mr. Loftus indicate he is referring to members of Savak , the secret police of the late Shah of Iran. // Strong stuff , to be sure . But there is a question as to whether the author in his zealousness may not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nazis and an " even larger number of Ukrainian Nazis " were smuggled in . But he fails to draw a distinction between documented war criminals and hangers-on and perhaps other less culpable collaborators . Mr. Loftus also calls his accuracy into question by misspelling the names of his two former superiors at the Justice Department , Allan A. Ryan Jr. and Walter Rockler . Still , " The Belarus Secret " is certain to be a valuable source book when Congress reopens hearings , probably in the fall , into allegations of a war criminal cover-up. //
