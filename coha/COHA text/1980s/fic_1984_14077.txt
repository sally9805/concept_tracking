Mountain music , which fades into a man whistling . The stae is backed with aged wood , suggesting the Smoky Mountains . There is a platform at center , representing the interior of a mountain cabin . In darkness , three figures sit turned away , before a large battered cupboard . On the wall or next to the cupboard hang two extra slat chairs . The lights fade and narrow into one light down center . Into it steps the Sang Picker , a mountain woman . She wears a long black coat-like dress , carries a hoe , a barlow knife , and a burlap sack . She holds up the sack . SANG PICKER Gen Sang . Grows wild on Sand Mountain but powerful hard to find . Bring ye one whole dollar a dried pound . And why not ? Hit 'll keep yore body young . Gen Sang is China language . Hit means root of life . ( She reaches into the sack and pulls out a genseng root .

But do n't say why . I 'll tell ye why . Noah and them ravens just did n't get along , that 's why . Ever soul on Sand Mountain knows yore raven will jest downright dispute with ye . We are like that too , herabouts . Ca n't read no Bible , but love to dispute the thang anyhow . ( She looks about . ) Big these mountains . I never seen the end of them , never will .

( Pause . ) I reckon you 've heard Smoky Mountain head benders a-plenty . How Little Jack Killed the Giant and The Ghost of Daniel Boone , all that . And Bible Tales a-plenty , too . Noah in the Ark , Jonah in the Whale , Daniel in the Den , Moses Up the Mountain , all that . Ai n't no disputing them . But around here , we fancy ' em all mixed up up tegether , something a body ai n't heared four hundred times , something a body kin dispute . Like Why The Lord Come To Sand Moun tain . ( Thunder , far off , Wind . Lights change . ) Hit was a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sand Mountain was all a forest . Clouds had black bellies , rain wus in the air , and something up thar downright mean , a-figuring whut to do . ( Enter The Lord and Saint Peter . They wear long dark coats , mountain hats and kerchiefs , and carry small packs on their backs . They move toward the Sang Picker . ) Outlanders . I seen them afore they seen me . ( She steps back . The Lord moves forward , and looks around . Saint Peter follows. ) p. 3 SAINT PETER Lord , are you sure you know where we are ? LORD Well , just about . ( He sees the Sang Picker . He takes off his hat . ) Hidy . SANG PICKER How do . LORD That river called Little Scataway ? SANG PICKER Hit used to be , yes , sir . ( Pause . The Lord smiles . ) LORD Is it still ?

SANG PICKER Through Torn Britches Woods , Stand Around Gap , and Dog Slaughter Creek ? LORD Yes , m'am . SANG PICKER You willing to pass through Odd Bottom Cove , Hell Fer Breakfast , and Prosper Valley ? p. 4 LORD I am . SANG PICKER Then I suspect you 'll come to Sand Mountain about dusk . LORD You saying it 's just down the river ? SANG PICKER I ai n't saying hit 's not . LORD I thank you kindly . SANG PICKER Do n't say nothing about it . ( The Lord moves away .

Come to the Smokies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prosper Valley , with a mountain night at their heels , and the sky all a clabbering up fer a storm , Saint Peter wanted to stay thar . ( The Lord and Saint Peter have walked around the stage . Now Saint Peter breaks away from The Lord and comes to the edge of the stage , looking out over Prosper Valley . The Sang Picker moves to one side of the stage and sits on a crate . ) SAINT PETER Come here , Lord ! Look down there ! Must be Prosper Valley . ( The Lord comes up beside him . From the valley below , we hear voices singing a hymn : " What A Friend We Have In Jesus , or , if at Christmas , " Silent Night . " A figure enters from behind the Sang Picker . He is a Prosper Valley Farmer , a large well-fed man . He listens . ) Look at that good bottom land , Lord ! p. 5 PROSPER VALLEY FARMER ( To himself . ) Lord ? SAINT PETER Black dirt crops .

SAINT PETER You might be . Some see them , some do n't . PROSPER VALLEY FARMER Then could you really be the Lord Jesus and  --  SAINT PETER Saint Peter , beloved of the Lord . That 's right . ( The Prosper Valley Farmer falls to his knees . ) PROSPER VALLEY FARMER Well , Halleluia ! Lord ! Saint Peter ! I 'm from Prosper Valley , down yonder !

SAINT PETER But it 's almost dark ! And those clouds ! I think there 's a storm coming . LORD There is . And we 're going up there . ( The Lord begins to walk around the stage . Saint Peter follows him . ) SAINT PETER All right , Lord . Whatever you say . ( To Prosper Valley Farmer . ) Sorry , Mister . So long . ( Thunder , loud . Wind and rain . Lights flash as lightning strikes around them . They move from one side of the stage to the other . The Prosper Valley Farmer , at a distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break on their heads , powerful ornery . They climbed Sand Mountain purt near two mile . Cold and bone-marrow damp , hit was . Raw wind , gusts sweeping the slopes . Hit was plain uncomfortable . ( Saint Peter and The Lord struggle through the storm , followed by the Prosper Valley Farmer. ) p. 7 SAINT PETER Lord , wait a minute ! ( He sneezes . ) Where are we going ? ( He sneezes again . The Lord points to the center of the stage . ) LORD There . Right up there . ( In the cabin , a dim figure of a woman lights a candle . ) SANG PICKER Now pon my word and deed , through the wind and the rain Saint Peter seen a little tee-ninesy light in what was jest the worst kind of slattery old cabin . Timber all warped , held together it was by sticks , and mud . There was n't even a dog around the place to bark at them . ( The Lord and Saint Peter approach the cabin . They stand before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watches . ) LORD Knock . ( Saint Peter knocks upon an imaginary door . Nothing happens . ) Again . Harder . ( Saint Peter knocks again , harder . ) SAINT PETER If I knock any harder , it 'll fall down . ( The figure of a man picks up the candle and comes to the door . With him is Fourteen Children , played by one child , a boy as young as possible , who is dressed very poorly , dirty and ragged . The man 's clothes , hair and beard are all unkempt and his eyes are feverish . He opens the door a crack. ) p. 8 JACK Whatchu men want here ? SAINT PETER ( To The Lord . ) Lord , this is pitiful . LORD Ask . SAINT PETER ( Sighs . ) All right . ( To Jack . ) I am Saint Peter and this is The Lord . Can we come in ? ( Pause . Jack and his child stare at them . ) JACK Yer who ? SAINT PETER Saint Peter and The Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're tired , hungry , cold , and rained on . We 'd appreciate a place to spend the night . ( A woman in the cabin turns around . She is much younger than the man , but gaunt and pale . She calls out . ) JEAN Who is it ? JACK Two men . Allowing as how they 're The Lord and Saint Peter . They want in . JEAN Well , tell ' em to possess their souls in patience . ( She goes to the door , lurching unsteadily . She is also dressed in rags , unkempt as her husband . She stares out , squinting and weaving . Saint Peter turns away from her . ) SAINT PETER Whew ! Lord , this woman 's drunk . Smell her breath ? p. 9 LORD They both are . ( Thunder crashes down on them . The rain pounds down . Lightning flashes . The wind howls . ) JEAN Why , shore . I kin tell . At thar 's The Lord and at thar 's Saint Peter . Of a sartin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JEAN No , but whut difference do hit make ? Whoever they be , if they figgur on cutting our throats , all they have to do is kick down the door . ( Thunder , rain , wind and lightning . Jean takes the chairs down from the wall . ) SAINT PETER I 'm sorry to trouble you , but we 're getting wet . ( He sneezes again . ) JACK Well , come on in . JEAN ( Laughing . ) Jest in time fer supper . ( Jack and Jean step back . Lights come up on the interior of the mountain cabin . It is stark and primitive . Outside , the Prosper Valley Farmer has seen The Lord and Saint Peter enter the cabin . With a gesture of disgust , he exits . ) SANG PICKER Hit was n't much more'n a shack . A stone fireplace , some slat chairs , an old battered cupboard , a split log fer a dinner table , some cornshuck mattresses , and that was all . Saint Peter seen what this was . A hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Lord gets the head of the table , I reckon , and Saint Peter sits the foot of it , or something like that . Shore . At 's right . ( They sit around the table . The Lord at right , Saint Peter at left . Jean goes to a pot hanging in the fireplace , over a meager flame . ) SANG PICKER The woman give them what she had . Shaller clay bowls of thin corn soup . A thumb of cornbread apiece . And now , friends , that there was all . There was n't no more . ( Saint Peter and The Lord look at what they have to eat , and then they look at the child , who gets the same , sits and eats greedily . ) An old man and his young wife , the way men do in these mountains , her having babies one a year since she was a little girl herself , fourteen children now , none of ' em too happy mealtimes . They took what they got , sat down and fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that ! No , I wo n't ! Yes , you will ! No , I wo n't ! Let that be ! I 'll bust you upside the head ! I 'll tear out yore gizzard ! No , you wo n't ! Yes , I will ! Ow ! Ow ! JEAN Hush , chillun ! Eat yore supper ! SANG PICKER Hit was jest plain squalid . Saint Peter had a hard time achoking down at soup . This kind of thang got on his nerves . He appreciated one thing at a time , calm at the dinner table and quiet chillun . And at soup was hog slop . ( The Lord finishes his soup , with relish. ) p. 11 LORD Hmm . Very good . ( He reaches for his switch . He twitches it . There is a sudden glare and blaze of fire in the fireplace . The Lord smiles . Fourteen Children , finished , erupts again . ) FOURTEEN CHILDREN I wo n't neither ! Ow ! Give at back ! I 'll bust ye open ! I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ow ! Owww ! ! ! ( The Lord stands up . He goes to Fourteen Children . ) LORD ( Quietly . ) Hush . Listen to me . ( He holds out his arm . Fourteen Children goes to The Lord , leans against him and listens to him . ) SANG PICKER The Lord told Fourteen Children a story about a sad , worried peacock . Then he turned around and told anothern about a fat mountain lion . Then he told a story about chillun like them , all lost in the dark forest , what could n't get theirselves home . They smiled at the first two stories , but not at the last un . The Lord waved his stick and the fire blazed up agin and Fourteen Chillun commenced to yawn . Afore a grown man kin spit , they got drowsy and stayed that way . ( The Lord gets up , leaving Fourteen Children settled peacefully in the chair . They all stare at Fourteen Children , then Jack and Jean stare at The Lord as a bright light glows around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was the Lord . He can do anything . p. 12 LORD ( Smiling . ) He 's right . What you 're seeing now are halos . ( The light glows brighter , on him and on Saint Peter . ) That is Saint Peter . I am the Lord . ( Clumsily , Jack and Jean get to their knees before The Lord . ) No , now do n't do that . You 're not used to it , for one thing , and you 're both drunk for another . Just be yourselves . ( The light fades . Jack and Jean stand before The Lord and Saint Peter , hanging their heads . ) SANG PICKER Hit was a plain embarrassment . Neither soul thar knowed whut to say . ( Pause . ) SAINT PETER ( Sternly . ) What are your names ? JACK Jack , Saint Peter . JEAN Jean , Saint Peter . SAINT PETER Jack and Jean . Old man , young woman . Whiskey . You two married ? ( They look at each other , then shake their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( Same . ) Well , no wonder you 're in such a mess . JACK Lord . Saint Peter . Hit war n't always thisaway . We figgered we wus like everbody else , fer a time . But we ca n't farm no moren a passle of corn , land here above the waterfalls is powerful sandy , last year our cow died , and whut with the chillun being so puny and poorly , we stopped going places much , and afore we knowed it , we wus living up here alone . p. 13 SAINT PETER Up here by yourselves , with fourteen children and a jug of whiskey , drinking until the world looks little . JACK Yes , sir . JEAN Not at much at first , then the littliest bit more , and then some more and now all the time . We 've come to that . SAINT PETER And when you drink , do you fight ? Get mad , yell and shout , hit each other ? The children ? ( They nod . ) JACK AND JEAN ( Quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To The Lord . ) Whut happened to us , Lord ? SAINT PETER I just told you . Old man , young woman , no wedding , no church , and too much corn liquor . LORD ( To Saint Peter . ) Hush . ( To Jack . ) We ca n't really tell you . Life can be mysterious , sometimes , and sad . ( Pause . ) Let me put it this way . I have no sermons on the matter . ( With a look at Saint Peter . ) And neither does he . SANG PICKER Well since the Lord ruled that plumb out , Saint Peter did n't know whut else to say , and give up a-wondering why they wus there . Hit wus another embarrassment . The onliest question left hanging wus whut sort of tribute at miserable shack could pay to the Lord and his Apostle Peter , who 'd been good enough to visit . Jack figgured he only had one thang . ( Jack , making a decision , goes to the cupboard and gets a clay jug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Lord and Saint Peter . ) Sand Mountain brandy , Lord . Ai n't very much and ai n't very good but hit 's the best thang we got here , and hit 's yours . p. 14 SAINT PETER Man , put that away . That 's what 's caused all your trouble in the first place . LORD Hush . ( To Jack . ) That will do . We thank you . ( Jack pours brandy for them and for himself , to Saint Peter 's exasperation . When he is finished , we see he has poured out the last drop in the jug and there is nothing left . The Lord lifts his cup . ) LORD To this house . JACK AND JEAN Thank you , Lord . SAINT PETER Whew . To this house . ( They sip the mountain brandy . Saint Peter makes a face , and The Lord glares at him , kicks him under the table . Then he holds out his switch , swishes it slightly . The fire , with a whoosh , flares up again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SANG PICKER At brandy wus hair raisin ' . But , in the least little while , they wus all feeling powerful improved , like that pore corn soup had been nourishment a-plenty , and the awful brandy good fer a body , too . At fire , which wus almost burned out , flared up agin , and they found theirselves sitting around the place in tollable comfort , drinking and pondering the fire . ( Pause . ) Hit wus The Lord what commenced it . LORD Know what it means when you stumble over a stone ? p. 15 JACK No , Lord . Whut ? LORD ( Slowly . ) It means on that spot a fiddle player lies buried . ( Pause.Jack and Jean look at each other . ) JACK Know whut 's the onliest thang kin cure the deadly curdles of leper sickness ? LORD No . What ? JACK Ye have to wash yore skin in the blood of a man who 's life you have saved . ( The Lord nods . ) SANG PICKER The Lord pondered at . So did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear that ? JACK Here on Sand Mountain , awhile ago . I know a feller around here , too , says he once taught cats to hold candlesticks . ( Pause . ) SAINT PETER Oh , stop . What for ? JACK So he could turn a mouse loose , and see whut 's happen . LORD What did ? JACK Them cats dropped them candlesticks and went after at mouse . ( Pause . ) Ye learn , but ye fergit . SAINT PETER What ? LORD You learn , but you forget . p. 16 JACK I reckon . ( They acknowledge each other 's approval . ) SANG PICKER Now you know Saint Peter , pon my word and deed , he could n't comprehend why Jesus had at littliest piece of a smile on his face , or why Jack and Jean did too . Hit wus like the three of them wus taking a few throws and tosses afore some kind of a ball game . ( Pause . ) JEAN A humpback and blind man , down around Hazel Creek , robbed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods . And fell out . " You damn scoundrel , " said the blind man , " you 're a-cheating me . " " You miserable lint-head , " said the humpback , " you ai n't blind at tall . " " Yes , I am , " said the blind man and " No , you ai n't , " said the hump back , and then they both said , " You son of a bitch . " The humpback rubbed dirt in the blind man 's eyes , and that give him back his sight . The blind man hit the hump back with a stick , and that broke his hump . The blind man seen the humpback standing thar tall and handsome-bodied , and the humpback seen the blind man a-looking at him with two big shiny-smart eyes , and they fancied each other so much , they lived together happy and pleasant all their lives . ( Pause . ) SANG PICKER This time Saint Peter jest looked out the one winder of the cabin , at the rain a-coming down . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blind man and the humpback , and make some sense out of ' em , but he could n't and gave up . ( The Lord holds out his cup. ) p. 17 LORD Could I have a drop more of this good brandy ? JACK We 're sorry , Lord . JEAN There ai n't no more . That wus all we had . LORD Take a look . ( Jack picks up what he is sure is an empty jug , and finds it heavy and full . ) SANG PICKER Shore enough , the jug was full , so Jack poured them all a big fat dollop . And hit did n't taste like no sulfur this time , no , sir , hit tasted like the bestest gum tree mountain brandy a body ever had . I mean , hit wus smooth as cedar and warm as a cat . ( Thunder , wind , rain and a surge of flames in the fireplace . ) And while at storm broke open above ' em , big logs , thick and fat , jest plain grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pore miserable shack , goobers and gusts of rain passed right over the roof , and never touched it nowhere . ( Saint Peter makes a show of stretching and yawning . ) SAINT PETER I sure am sleepy . That brandy . This fire . All the rain . Lord , is n't it about time we turned in ? LORD Not yet . ( He smiles , sips his brandy and waits . ) JACK One day , near Hangman 's Gap , a deef man went to see his sick neighbor . ( Saint Peter sits back , groaning . ) He set down by his neighbor 's bed and said , " How are ye ? " Sick man said , " Dying . " Deef man said , " Thank God fer that ! Who 's yer doctor ? " Sick man said , " Doctor Death ! Now git out and leave me alone ! " Deef man said , " At 's wonderful ! Whut medicine is he a-giving ye ? " Sick man said , " Poison ! Now will ye plain damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Why , shorely , and I 'll come see ye tomorrow , too . " ( Pause . Jack , Jean , and The Lord relish the story . As before , Saint Peter shakes his head. ) p. 18 SANG PICKER Right about here Saint Peter plain decided Jack had woobles in the head . He looked over at The Lord to sort of shrug but there The Lord was , a-smiling agin . And then , whut floored Saint Peter , The Lord was a-telling one ! ( The Lord leans forward in his chair , and tells a story , inaudible to us , to Jack and Jean . Saint Peter stares at him , openmouthed . ) Some story about folks he 'd heared of near the Cumberland Gap , where the men were so contrary , if ye throwed them in a river , they 'd float upstream . Where the women wus so ugly they had to blindfold babies to git ' em to suck . ( Jack and Jean nod their approval , without smiling more than they need to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thunder . Lightning . ) Logs burned . At jar stayed full of brandy . Rain and wind flew past the shack , leaving it dry . Jack told  --  JACK The Moon Frog  --  SANG PICKER Jean told  --  JEAN The Water Man  --  SANG PICKER The Lord told  --  LORD The Child Who Could Not Shudder . ( Thunder , lightning , rain and wind . ) SANG PICKER Then Jack told  --  JACK The Breaking of the Stone of Patience  --  p. 19 SANG PICKER Jean told  --  JEAN Sherrif Unexpected and the Bony Bandit . SANG PICKER And The Lord told  --  LORD Flowering Cholera , Phantom Funerals , and Sleeping Kings . ( Pause . Saint Peter smacks a fist into the palm of one hand , decisively . ) SANG PICKER Saint Peter figgured this 'd gone fur enough . Crazy wild stories , well , he 'd fight fire with fire , and give ' em something strong , human , and down to earth sensible . With a meaning to it ! SAINT PETER Once upon a time , there was a Sailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Queen , who was beautiful and proud . She kept him in a golden cage in her castle bedroom . One day the Queen stepped naked out of her bath . The Parrot whistled and said , " Whew-o ! I see your ass ! " This made the Queen furious . She opened the golden cage , pulled out that Parrot by the throat , choked him , banged him on the floor , and threw him out the window . He landed on a pile of garbage . He was lying there when a scrawny Chicken came sailing out of the kitchen window , neck wrung too , and landed on the garbage pile next to the Parrot . The Parrot thought a minute , and then said , " Whew-o ! Whose ass did you see ? " ( Saint Peter laughs at his own story , slapping his knees. ) p. 20 SANG PICKER Jack , Jean and the Lord were real polite about it . JEAN That wus plain interesting . JACK Hit wus , of a sartin . SANG PICKER Then Jean told  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( There is a terrific burst of thunder , wind and lightning . Saint Peter shrinks back in his chair . ) SANG PICKER Saint Peter 's skin plain crawled . In the rain outside , at Sand Mountain wind howled like bobcats . Then Jack and Jean together told  --  JACK Goforth Baines . JEAN And his devil son , Stamper . SAINT PETER Oh , really . JACK And how he died . You want to hear it , Lord ? LORD We do . ( A low rumble of thunder . ) JACK First you must know Stamper Baines got a Sand Mountain girl named Sally Newell pregnant . JEAN Sally loved him fer that . She come a-running with shining eyes , to tell him about the baby . When did he want to marry her ? JACK Stamper jest laughed . Whut kind of a fool did she take him fer ? At baby 's got as many daddys as a pickle 's got warts . p. 21 JEAN Sally hated him fer that . When Stamper went off from her still alaughing , hit were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack , Zack and Mack Newell . They waited fer Stamper Baines behind a chincapin tree , fell upon him graveyard deadly with barlow knives , cut him all apart , throwed the pieces in a totesack , and give it to Sally Newell . From his bones  --  JEAN She made her a chair . JACK From his skin  --  JEAN She made her a mattress . JACK From his skull  --  JEAN She made her a goblet . JACK Wine from his blood . JEAN Candles from his fat . JACK Candlewicks from his hair . JEAN Stew from his fingers . JACK And soup from his balls . JEAN Then she invited his father , Goforth Baines , to supper . ( Saint Peter chokes and coughs . ) JACK But Goforth Baines had his doubts . He come to Sally Newell 's cabin , but with eyes in the back of his head . When she laid out the big meal afore him , he asked her what she 'd been a-doing lately . Sally smiled at that . p. 22 JEAN She answered him with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I BEEN A SITTING WITH MY LOVE-O- JACK ( Speaking . ) The chair  --  JEAN I BEEN A-DRINKING WITH MY LOVE-O  --  JACK The goblet  --  JEAN I BEEN A-SLEEPING WITH MY LOVE-O  --  JACK The mattress  --  JEAN I BEEN A-READING WITH MY LOVE-O  --  JACK The candles  --  JEAN I BEEN A-EATING WITH MY LOVE-O  --  JACK The soup and the stew  --  JEAN I 'LL GIVE YOU SOME WINE-O  --  JACK The blood  --  JEAN IF YE GUESS ME A-RIGHT-O ! JACK But all fer naught , cause Goforth Baines guessed her hateful riddle , unsheathed his own great barlow knife , and called her she-devil . In rushed Jack , Zack and Mack Newell , to cut Goforth apart too , but mighty Goforth Baines , in a tantrum , killed them all , afore he cut off Sally Newell 's head . ( Jack and Jean sing lustily , with mountain harmony , stamping their feet. ) p. 23 JACK AND JEAN ( Singing . ) HE SWUNG AROUND HIS BARLOW KNIFE THEM BAD MEN THEY DID FALL , HE CUT SALLY 'S HEAD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JACK Then Goforth Baines , he stood thar in mortal dread at the dinner table . Stamper Baines , his evil boy . He wept his bitter tears , a-touching the bone chair , a-lifting the burning candles , and a-smelling the simmering soup . ( Saint Peter , watching , shakes his head . ) SAINT PETER Really . SANG PICKER Now you know Saint Peter did n't begrudge nobody no story , but he did figgure hit ought to have some mortal point to it . I say , be about life as hit really is . He did mislike jimcracky tales about people eating other people , rats born in place of babies , and wooble-headed heroes with names like Stamper and Goforth . So he stopped listening . Fer awhile . JEAN Lord , you strike a body dead , they tell a Jesus Tale ? SAINT PETER Tell a what ? LORD ( Smiling . ) No . Which ones you know ? JEAN All of ' em , purt near . LORD Tell some . p. 24 JEAN You plain positive ? LORD I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? Jesus Tales ? LORD That 's right . Hush . JEAN ( To Jack . ) Whut 'll we tell ? JACK Well , thar 's Saint Peter 's Divorce . SAINT PETER Saint Peter 's what ? JEAN That 's whar Saint Peter is womberjawled miserable cause his wife talks too much , and he asks the Lord to git him a divorce , and the Lord says well , all right , but only if Saint Peter will marry the next woman coming down the road . SAINT PETER Now , Lord . Wait a minute . LORD Tell it . JACK And the next woman down the road is decent looking and nods yes she 'll marry Saint Peter , and be grabbies hit turns out she ca n't talk at all , so Saint Peter gets right happy until the Lord takes a nail pulled out of a coffin , sets it agin her back tooth , knocks the tooth out  --  JEAN And at woman commences to talk and talk and she ca n't stop , so Saint Peter gives up and goes back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 25 SANG PICKER And Saint Peter got up then , right stiffly , stood thar resenting all at . But the Lord was smiling , so whut could he do ? ( The Lord leans forward and starts telling Jack and Jean another story . Fourteen Children wakes up and listens , too . ) Then The Lord told Jesus , Saint Peter , the Goose and the Bean , which they had n't never heard . ( Saint Peter turns away , offended . ) And Saint Peter , he wondered then , jest a mite bitter about it , why it wus he wus forever the dummy in these doings . ( Saint Peter looks at The Lord , rubs his head . ) Why does The Lord treat me this away ? When I love him and always have and always will . Why are we a setting here in this miserable shack with these crazy people got woobles in their heads ? Why ai n't we down thar in at Prosper Valley we seen , with them good healthy Christian farmers , siging hymns . None @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Saint Peter sits again . The Lord finishes his story , which goes over big . Jack and Jean laugh and applaud . And Fourteen Children likes it , too . Smiling , The Lord fills their cups again with brandy . ) LORD Well , one more . JACK What 'll hit be , Lord ? JEAN You pick it out this time . ( Pause . The Lord is suddenly serious . He speaks very softly ) p. 26 LORD Tell Joseph the Carpenter . JEAN Old Man Joseph ? LORD And his family . You know it ? JACK AND JEAN ( Together . ) We all do . ( They look at Fourteen Children , who nods . ) LORD Good . Tell it . JACK All right . JACK AND JEAN We will . SANG PICKER And they did . Before the Lord and Saint Peter , this man and his young wife told the old story The Lord needed to hear , and to hear it , from them , is Why The Lord Come To Sand Mountain .

Then he met Mary this young girl , who did n't want no young man . ( They move D. , out of the shack . Fourteen Children stays in his chair .
