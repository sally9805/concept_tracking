Honors celebrate eight remarkable achievers <P> PEACE : PROUD AND SAD <P> It was only a small courtesy , but it changed the young man 's life . One day in a black shantytown near Johannesburg , South Africa , Primary Schoolteacher Desmond Mpilo Tutu saw a white man respectfully tip his hat to a black woman . Tutu had never seen a white make such a gesture . The woman was Tutu 's mother ; the white was the Rev. Trevor Huddleston , now an Anglican bishop . The priest subsequently befriended the young black , and after Tutu was hospitalized in 1953 for tuberculosis , Huddleston visited him daily for 20 months . Tutu , profoundly impressed , followed his white friend into the clergy , rising rapidly in the Anglican Church in southern Africa and becoming Bishop of Lesotho in 1976 . Along the way , Tutu also became a leading voice in the battle against apartheid . His outspoken courage , coupled with the nonviolent nature of his message , last week brought Bishop Tutu , now 53 , the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elated and you feel sad , " said Tutu in Johannesburg . " One of my greatest sadnesses is that there are many in this country who are not joining in celebrating something that is an honor for this country . " <P> Tutu is a prophet without honor in his own country . The South African government seized his passport in 1981 , and he now needs special permission for his numerous speaking trips outside the country . The government , which is elected by the country 's 18% white minority , also conducted an investigation into the liberal South African Council of Churches ( membership : 13 million ) , which Tutu has headed since 1978 . That inquiry resulted in a verbal public denunciation that charged the feisty preacher and the council with waging " massive psychological warfare " against the government and sympathizing with outlawed liberation groups such as the Zambia-based African National Congress ( A.N.C. ) . <P> In his racially torn nation , Tutu walks a tricky tightrope . Although many members of the white establishment look upon him as a dangerous radical , black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejects government categories and calls himself " detribalized , " says he faces a " rough passage " in pleading with young black audiences for interracial concord and peaceful change . And although Tutu does not advocate violence , he warns continually of a coming " bloodbath " if whites do not share power with the black majority . Afrikaners , he notes , praise their own gun-toting forebears but " suddenly become pacifists when it involves black liberation . Blacks do n't believe they are introducing violence into the situation . They believe the situation is already violent . " <P> Though two of his four children live in the U.S. , Tutu is embittered over the current U.S. hands-off policy toward South Africa . The black leader advocates political , diplomatic and especially economic pressures from overseas to force whites to negotiate a sharing of power with blacks . But the bishop has never explicitly advocated boycotts or a cutoff of investments , which the A.N.C . last week declared would be a fitting response to Tutu 's prize . Nonetheless , Tutu states that " I find what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morally repulsive. "
