 | They were white , Protestant and almost always Republican . They were wealthy , well-bred women ? often bearing illustrious last names like Roosevelt , Vanderbilt and Astor ? who took it for granted that belonging to the Junior League , one of the most elite women 's organizations in turnof-the-century America , was a nice thing to do . Today 's Junior League wants a grittier image ; its members have peeled off their white gloves to tackle problems like child abuse , adolescent pregnancy and rape . But while pushing for social change , the league is also trying to hang on to its social status ? which suffered when the Social Register dropped the club in 1981 . The league is attempting a difficult two-step that has volunteers wondering if it is really possible to be both posh and purposeful . The league today bears little resemblance to the group of young debutantes rounded up by Mary Harriman , the sister of former New York Gov . Averell Harriman , in 1901 . While most of its 163,000 members are still from well-to-do families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Working women , who dropped volunteer jobs in order to pursue careers in the 1970s , are back in force : of the 12,000 women who joined last year , 42 percent have full-time jobs . The average New York Junior Leaguer is 32 , married , the mother of one or two children , and a professional . After years of controversy generated by newspapers and local organizations over its discriminatory membership , the league in 1978 mandated a new admissions policy , suggesting that local chapters open up their ranks . It is up to the 266 regional chapters to decide to follow the new policy , but Jewish , black and Hispanic women are slowly being allowed to join many of them . " All we expect from members today is a commitment to volunteer , " says Judy York , head of the Chicago league . " It is the ' 80s way for women to network and exchange ideas while still doing good . " High-profile projects : As the league has expanded , it has shifted the focus of its activities from fund raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops , annual rummage sales and charity balls , but it also sends volunteers to work in prisons , halfway houses , hospices for the terminally ill , clinics for alcohol- and drugabuse counseling and many other programs . The Kansas City chapter earned $525,000 last year from its ball and sales of cookbooks ; it uses the money to operate projects that run the gamut from helping victims of domestic violence to bringing cultural arts to children . The league 's work is increasingly subsidized by grants from major corporations : a widely respected research report on parental leave published last year was funded in part by Johnson &; Johnson baby products . High-profile projects ? like an inner-city day camp for underprivileged children in Dallas ? have attracted the attention of local officials and won the group awards . " I 've seen the league at work and it 's one organization I greatly admire , " says Catherine Stayman , a Republican candidate for one of Dallas @#  | County 's two juvenile-court judgeships , who joined the league earlier this year . In recent years the league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Los Angeles league established a committee that tries to place members in local and state government positions . In some cities the league virtually controls the charity circuit : " You can not get a good volunteer job in Dallas unless you 're in the league , " says a former member of the Dallas chapter . " They 've tied up all the best positions . " On a national level the league proposes legislation to Congress , publishes its own literature and employs a full time lobbyist in Washington . " We have invested our money , our volunteers and our time , " says Judie Greenman , former presi- dent of the Ft . Worth league . " It is natural now to let our voices be heard . " Says Linda Benoist of the St. Louis league , " The Junior Leagues are as powerful in this country as the League of Women Voters . " While that may overstate the case , the league has clearly come a long way , too far to suit many members who oppose its new admissions policies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisters : the New York league ( and some chapters are even pickier ) requires two sponsors , four letters of recommendation , approval of the board and dues of $280 a year . Sponsors must be active or retired members , ensuring that the candidates are screened by those sympathetic with league values . Defensive about its high-Wasp image , the league claims not to keep membership figures for local chapters along ethnic or religious lines . Therefore , the national board can not ? and does not choose to ? enforce its own mandate on admissions . " We 've come miles and miles , " says Fran Villere , secretary of the Association of Junior Leagues . " But it 's like a family . You ca n't bring the whole tribe along at the same time . " Local leagues have been slow to give up their old ways , and minority members are still scarce . The New Orleans league , for example , has no black members and only admitted its first Jewish women a few years ago ? while the local chapter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) has always found plenty of enthusiastic volunteers . The Austin chapter first admitted Jewish women last year , and according to a local gossip columnist , " The league has been going crazy over that , and the old , old Austin group is huffy . " By turning away volunteers , is n't the league confusing its social position with its social purpose ? " Not having national requirements for open admissions does n't hamper our vision of diversification , " says Molly Bayley , chair of the diversification committee . " And we like to give the leagues the opportunity to decide what makes sense for each of them . " The line between social work and social work still blurs . In Albuquerque , N.M. , for example , league members exhaust much of their energy on the annual Senorita Ball and measure social standing by the yards of silk taffeta used in their daughters ' dresses . " The Albuquerque league is for social climbers , " says one former member who quit because " everything revolved around money . " In Dallas , preparing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost full-time occupation . " For the show , @# @# women actually go to singing and dancing lessons ? it 's a really big thing , " says Christy Marshall , an ex-debutante who has been a member of the Chicago , Dallas and New York leagues . Thrift-shop hours : But even jaded observers point out that the parties and well-appointed clubhouses are necessary enticements , the sugar coating on a bitter pill . " Part of the appeal is that it is a rather exclusive organization , almost like a sorority for older women , " says Sheila Bosworth , a New Orleans author who declined to join the local league . " But sororities and country clubs are all about pleasure , whereas the Junior League is very hard work , very demanding and very time-consuming . Yet women are joining in droves and being very faithful to their thrift-shop hours . I wonder how long that would continue if it were not prestigious to be in the Junior League ? " It has , until recently , been considered unfashionable to be fashionable . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the exclusive club has once again become a proud badge of good breeding . Membership is healthier than ever . The black-tie parties and debutante balls the league gives are suddenly hot social events . Classconscious adolescents happily accompany their mothers to meetings older siblings shunned only a few years ago . Still , progress is in the air . Glancing up at a wall of portraits of past league presidents , Susie Johnson , who , with her sister , is among the New York league 's several black members , says , " There 's no doubt that 50 years ago one of those women would have been asking me to get them a napkin . "
