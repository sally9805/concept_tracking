The scene looked more like a meeting of the U.N . General Assembly than a civil trial , as San Francisco 's Nourse Auditorium last week became the largest courtroom in memory . Dozens of lawyers at 28 counsel tables appeared before California Judge Ira Brown at the start of what could be an 18-month megatrial . At issue is who should bear the cost of asbestos-related lawsuits ; 25,000 of them have been filed against some 30 companies , mostly by former workers ill with cancer and lung disease associated with breathing in asbestos fibers . In the San Francisco case , five former asbestos manufacturers  --  the largest being the Manville Corp .  --  are suing 65 insurance companies , each of which cites various reasons why its policies do not cover the asbestos claims . Manville has already settled with six of its insurers for a sum that suggests the enormous stakes involved : $427 million . <P> No regular courtroom could hold the 150 lawyers who are expected to be involved in the trial , so the parties agreed to pay for the renovation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sprucing up will cost $200,000 , plus another $200,000 for a computer system to keep track of the &; 50,000 documents that may be introduced as evidence . Millions more , of course , will go toward the lawyers ' fees . A dozen asbestos victims protested the high cost outside the courtroom on the trial 's first day , although the huge proceeding will not necessarily affect what they are paid . A Rand Corp . study estimates that litigation expenses already consume 63 cents out of every dollar spent in asbestos lawsuits . Said one picket 's sign : LAWYERS PLAY WHILE VICTIMS PAY .
