txt IF IT HAD NOT BEEN raining the morning of July 30 , 1979 , the woman would have looked behind her to say hello to the little poodle who lived in the house near the train station . But she thought the dog would be inside that gray day , and she was late for her train anyway , so she hurried on . The next thing she knew , she was grabbed from behind and literally knocked out of her shoes by a man who threw her into nearby bushes , choked her , and raped , her . On Oct. 10 , 1980 , Maurice Dunn , 20 , was sentenced to 40 years in prison for raping the woman . Dunn 's conviction was the result of cooperation and hard work on the part of the Cook County state 's attorney 's office , the Chicago police , and the Beverly Area Planning Association , a community organization that got involved because the rape occurred in Beverly . THE HEROINE OF the case , the main reason Dunn is no longer on the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary I 'll call Jane . She was the best witness I 've ever seen " said Paul Nealis , one of the assistant state 's attorneys // A victim puts rapist behind bars // who presented the case . Before he joined the state 's attorney 's office , Nealis was a Chicago police officer for 12 years , assigned to homicide and sex crimes . There was never any doubt in Jane 's mind , nor in her husband 's , that she would follow through with the case . " I could not have lived with myself if I had not , " she said . Jane , who is shout 5 feet tall and weighs about len pounds , was on her way to the Hoek Island station at 91111 Street : and Longwood Drive . She had parked her car and was hurrying as she opened her unbrella , chocked her train schedule , and looked at her mock IT SAID 7:45 " when I was grabbed around the neck with such force I was pushed forward and nick and off my feet at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mud . " I never had a chance to yell . When you are grabbed like that , you lock up . You 're not so stunned you do n't know what 's going on , but you do n't do anything . " Ile said , ' I got you now . yott --  ; He told me if I looked at him , he would kill me. ? Because of the way they landed in the mud , though , she looked right at him . " The look on his face . . she said . She looked at his arm , the one around her neck , clicking her . " Always the arm , " she said . " It was so huge . I ca n't tell you what it 's like to be choked . I could n't breathe . " I had time to think and time to do things , but nothing worked . At times I was calm . At times I fought like hell . But it seemed if I was calm , I got hurt less . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked him what the hell he wanted , why was he doing this . I said ' I do n't even know you . ' He kept telling mete shut up . " I did n't have any money , but I told him to take my purse anyway . I did n't Close-up realize what was going to happen until he kissed me on the neck and said I smelled so good . I was wearing perfume my husband had brought , me from Spain . I still have it , but have n't worn it since . " I kept looking for something to hit him with , but I could n't find anything big enough . He talked to me . His voice was nervous , but under control . He said , ' Give me your watch . ' , " While I was doing that , I scratched him . I tried for his eyes . I kept it up , then I made my break . I kind of leaped forward , then started to crawl . He grabbed my ankles , and I turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second good look . " I was digging into the ground , trying to bang on , but he pulled me back by my feet . I kept digging , but I was exhausted . Sometimes there is just no more in you . Not that I gave up , but ... " He lunged at me and stuck my face in the dirt . I thought , ' Sly Father , what the hell are you ming tots to me tor : " He said , ' I told you not to look at me . Now , you are really going toi get it . ' I thought , ' Good-by , Jane . ' " HE PULLED my shirt over my head . I struggled . Then he undid my pants , I thought , ' Holy Christ . ' I fought some more , but I could n't get away . " I thought of telling him I had V.D. , but decided not to . I thought it would make him mad . I did n't want to get cut up . " After he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mud . I thought , ' He 's going to hurt me , but I 'm going to look anyway . ' I got up and I turned around and I looked right at his face . " The fact that Jane got at least three good looks at Dunn 's face was important to his conviction . She was able to identify him in a lineup , mid she was able to convince a jury that he was the man . After she looked , " I ran to Longwood Drive , " she said . " A cur was coining . I threw myself at it . " All I had on was my bra and my knee-high stockings . My face was covered with dirt . I had dirt in my teeth . " THE CAR stopped , and I opened the door and leaped into the driver 's seat , The man looked at me like I was out of my tree . " I told him to let me drive , that I 'd get the guy . I had a picture in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pin him to a tree . " Jane kept trying to push the driver over so she could pursue her attacker . The driver kept trying to push her out of the car . Ito told her oho Then another car came along . Jane ran toward it through the rain , a rain that cooled her , almost soothed her . " The young man stopped , " she said . " He gave me his shirt and took me to his parents ' porch , which was right there . He was tremendous . Ile did n't touch me . He told me where we were going . He explained it was his mother 's louse , and we would call the police . " His mother got me a blanket and a blue velour robe . She wanted to hug inc. , but . I was hurt . I did n't want anyone touching me . I was a little wild at that time . I kept saying I wanted a cigaret sod a gun . I wanted to go chase the NY . " THE POLICE arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital . On the Nay , " He said , ' You were raped . Big deal . I could have , been picking you up it the morgue . " Jane 's husband Supported her through : very second of her ordeal , through inerviews with the police and prosecuors , through the court hearings , through he first trial , which ended in a hang limy , and through the second , which re- suited in Dunn 's conviction . There are , of course , victim assistance programs and women 's groups that support rape victims , but the fact that her husband was always with her helped . Jane do " what I had to do . " What she had to do was testify . The prosecutors , Nealis and Thomas O'Donnell , went through what would happen with her before she took the stand . She knew there was a group of people from Beverly in court to lend any support they could . THouGH NEITHER Jane nor Dunn was from Beverly , the association got involved because they felt the attack on Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way we could help was to have people in the court , " said Mary Olsson of the Beverly association . " Sometimes , when I could n't take it any inure in court and had to leave , they row out and told me I had to go bark , " Jane said . When she testified , Jane broke down . So did some of the jurors . The trial was stopped a couple of times so she could compose herself . " I said to myself . ' OK , you have to do it . This is your chance , and it 's the only chance you are going to get . ' " And I won . If I hadn't. done it . I could never have lived the lie with my-sell ' or my husband . " Damn it , I 'm not ashamed . It 's my body , and I choose to give it to whom I want . Here this clown comes along and takes me . " My God . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
