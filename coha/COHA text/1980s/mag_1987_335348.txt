The questions would not go away . But every time a Reagan Administration official tried to clarify the U.S. 's role in the Persian Gulf last week , the issue only grew muddier . Finally Ronald Reagan appeared in the White House briefing room Friday afternoon to justify his policy in the wake of Iraq 's accidental assault on the U.S.S. Stark . " Mark this point well , " he said . " The use of the vital sea-lanes of the Persian Gulf will not be dictated by the Iranians . These lanes will not be allowed to come under the control of the Soviet Union . The Persian Gulf will remain open to navigation by the nations of the world . " <P> Reagan 's blunt words came at the end of a week of intense debate about the Administration 's plan to provide naval protection to Kuwaiti oil tankers traveling through the gulf . The proposal calls for eleven Kuwaiti vessels to be registered under the U.S. flag and manned by American captains . The Kuwaiti tankers will also receive U.S. naval escorts . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Administration , caught between lawmakers demanding a greater say in the decision and military strategists trying to define how the Navy should react in case of attack , decided to delay implementation of the plan until mid-June . <P> While Iran has so far refrained from firing on American vessels in the gulf , Tehran vowed to continue shooting at Kuwaiti tankers , regardless of the flag they fly . Since September the Iranians have attacked 29 ships in the gulf , 25 of them serving Kuwait . In a meeting with foreign journalists , the President denied that he was " daring " the Khomeini regime to open fire . But when asked how the U.S. would react , Reagan replied , " I think it 's far better if the Iranians go to bed every night wondering what we might do than us telling them in advance . " <P> Many Congressmen , however , did not want to spend sleepless nights worrying about the U.S. response . " What we 're seeing down the road is the U.S. being sucked into this violent and savage war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana : " The environment surrounding our Navy in the Persian Gulf is as dangerous as the exposure of our Marines in Beirut . " Those fears were hardly allayed when Congress learned that U.S. ships had twice escorted Kuwaiti vessels , once in February and once last week . In both cases , Kuwaiti merchant ships delivered U.S.-manufactured M60 tanks and other military supplies to Bahrain . Last week the White House agreed to sign a bill requiring Reagan to report to Congress on the threat to U.S. forces in the gulf and the Navy 's rules of engagement . <P> Many Pentagon officials also expressed concern about their mission . " They need to tell us what they want us to do , " said one . " Do you want us to shoot down planes that come too close ? Do you want us to wait until we 're attacked and then turn somebody to ashes ? "
