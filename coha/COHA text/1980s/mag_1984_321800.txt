BALM IN GILEAD by Lanford Wilson <P> In the realm of today 's performing arts , energy is an overvalued coin . Its name is invoked to trumpet every gonadal excess from heavy metal to slasher movies . <P> It is used as a populist club to pulverize the old elitist verities : grace , wit , precision , proportion , coherence . No walking of the fine narrative line for the apostles of anarchy , whose police-siren song goes like this : Wake up , pal ! Get out of your fusty drawing room and hit the streets ! The Aristotelian unities are dead ! Modern life is chaos , and this time around , art is life set to a whomping backbeat that never lets up . When society has fallen apart , do n't pick up the pieces , just admire them where they fall . <P> Energy-atomic , unharnessed , virulent-abounds in Chicago 's Steppenwolf Theater Company revival of Balm in Gilead , the Lanford Wilson dope opera that was first produced in 1965 . The set may depict a grungy , all-night coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon takes on the sulfurous glow of the lower depths : a rush-hour subway car , say , some time during World War III . Junkies , hookers , drag queens , derelicts , ganefs and hit men rub up against Joe ( Danton Stone ) and Darlene ( Laurie Metcalf ) , a couple too amiable or dense to survive the Nighttown scene till morning . " They every one of them steal , " one denizen grumbles , and steal they do : money , drugs , a cup of coffee , a shred of strutting self-respect , another minute of free-for-all banter before collapsing in sleep or death . <P> Stage-managing the zoo-parade is a strung-out addict named Dopey ( Gary Sinise ) , who looks and acts like a guerrilla refugee from the Twilight Zone . Sinise is one of the founders of Steppenwolf , an admirable community of switch-hitting theater folk in business for a decade and lately receiving wider acclaim for their Manhattan transfers of Sam Shepard 's True West and C.P. Taylor 's And a Nightingale Sang ... The director of Balm in Gilead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stardom with his roles in Broadway 's Death of a Salesman and the film Places in the Heart . In his liberal adaptation of Wilson 's text , Malkovich has shown some up-front ingenuity : spotlighting or freeze-framing a conversation , orchestrating the Ivesian symphony of invective , offering instant replays of the climactic murder . But chaos still reigns . It is as if the frat brothers from Animal House , instead of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland , decided to put the show on right here . <P> Actors love to appear in this kind of play , whether it is a tattered valentine to eccentricity like The Time of Your Life or a dopers ' tone poem like The Connection or this dated , indifferent travelogue through the seventh circle of hell . An actor can both inhabit his character and stand outside it , flashing signals to the audience that say , " I 'm not really this lowlife , but it 's fun to pretend . " Perhaps that is why the audience at off-Broadway 's spacious new Minetta Lane Theater , where Balm moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looks to be enjoying the play a bit too much for its own good . They are sharing not a drink of human dregs but a celebration of show biz in all its volcanic , specious theatricality . Such are the seductions of energy .
