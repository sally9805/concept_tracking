 | Nor did she pick only on the sick ; she went after Ailene , too , whenever she got the chance . Rach never let her mother forget that day , ages past , when the woman reprimanded four ingenuously foul-mouthed children who had come home full of the joyful discovery of dirty words . Appalled at the naifs , Mother had demanded , " Who do you think I am , one of your alley friends ? I 'm your mother , you know . " Now that the four kids were grown , Ailene could not say the word potty without Rachel jumping on her with , " Who do you think you are , one of our alley friends ? You 're our mother , you know . " And their father : their father was their father , as he was tonight again intent on proving . Rachel folded a pillow over the old man 's face and left him where he lay .

" At the door , she turned and said , " You deal with him , Artie . For a change . " " Terrific , " replied Artie , who had been dealing with him the only way he knew how . But he was glad at her exit . With Rachel gone , he could think more clearly . Truth was , his sister 's burlesque left Artie as queasy as Dad 's own . For all her insouciance , Rach could not pinch the word out of the man . It had to be removed by incision . Artie had it almost worked out , that calamine rub . The only thing preventing the recollection was his own reluctance to rebleed . But the alternative to remembering was worse . He turned in the rocker to look at Dad . " We are young , " he said . " Warm , " said Eddie Sr. " We are very young , and all together . Sometime in late summer . " " Very warm , " said his dad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we 've left the Brook Street house already . " " Exactly . Getting hot . " " And the kids have something . Some illness . The kids always had something , did n't they ? Whoever invented childhood diseases must have been able to retire early . " He looked to his father for an encouraging word . But he had already exceeded the usual seldom . The man had returned to the old arm crook and challenging silence . " It was for us . The calamine was for us , was n't it ? Wait a minute . It  | playing at surf casting , accidentally lands an eighteen-inch striped bass . Had he known there was any chance of his actually catching such a thing , this silvery creature gasping on the beach , he would never have pretended to fish in the first place . It is hard to say whether boy or dying fish blanches more . Mother cleans the animal in the sink for dinner . The family makes the most of things , and eats . Dad explains there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trim function on this forgiving earth . Dad is Ahab , up and down the beach searching for a certain piece of driftwood , while mother , his perfect foil , never leaves her bungalow chair for fear of getting sand in her knitting , the articles of winter practicality she makes merely by clicking sticks through mounds of Canadian wool . At the end of each row , Mom puts down her handiwork and sings a little something herself : " By the sea , by the sea , by the beautiful sea . " Only she sings " You and I , " instead of " You and me , " because of the predicative nominative , which is good grammar . She goes indoors and hides when Ed takes the kids swimming . Eddie Jr . makes a mighty effort to tell her : " It 's not swimming , Mom , it 's body surfing . " And one does it like this : open the chest , breathe deep , then push , push a little more , wait for the back swell , then get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and glide easy and stroke , the whole force of the ocean behind you . Only do n't get too far out in front or you will get crunched and crunched bad , tossed over and over into the churning sand , unable to tell which way is safety . When the whistle blows ( the fat man is up on shore , T-shirt , shorts , beaten-up straw hat , roving the terrain like a pro ) it means everybody out of the water and count off . One two three four . Four children present and accounted for . The whistle goes off every few minutes ; Dad carries it on a lanyard Mom has made for that purpose . When Rachel complains , " Ca n't you see that we 're all here without this numbers thing ? " he makes the JDs count by twos , and the next time by threes , and that 's education . That 's what he does for a living . Eddie Jr . says : " It goes up by four each time ! Let 's stay out here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing off , says " Googolplex . " And they invent names for what numbers come next . Mr. Starbuck gets taken out to sea in an undertow . He remembers thinking distinctly : " I should have known . The stream of white bubbles is the giveaway . " And when being swept out to the Aleutians seems  | tcitain , he looks back to shore , and thinks : This is my family . That 's our mummer rental cottage on Aptos . We 're on vacation . I was born in Saddle Brook , New Jersey . Counting by eights is the hardest . Many brave hearts pre asleep in the Deep . Mom runs down from the bungalow , out of her chair at last , and Dad takes off his T-shirt and hat and runs too . His belly is already a monster , but his legs and arms have not yet reached the cstrcme emaciation of later years . Just as he is about to surrender and chill , Artie remembers something . He swims parallel to shore , instead of toward it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to crawl hack in. le lies on the beach like that striped bass for a while . But soon Artie jumps up and proudly explains to his mother the parallel-swimming trick that just saved his life . Something he 'd read in a science magazine , and it worked just like they said it would . ' I ' he morning after an especially rough surf , four sore kids lie bedbound in collective grief greater than any the world has seen since Lily got them all the chicken pox from some kid in the alley . Each has been crunched h1 ' breakers many times over , and their sand-pounded sores threaten to fester . Mom yells something supposedly not at Dad about how if Edward wo n't drive up the coast for medicine , she 'll get the Rambler and go herself . Dad tries using the battle-scars line , the one about how " Wounds are the price of freedom . " Then he tries " Shake it off , " which is psychology , and he gets about 40 percent of Eddie Jr . to come over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell both parents to be quiet and let them die in peace . When all four give up on the chance of any salve coming to them in this lifetime , only then does Dad explain to them , whispering at first , then chanting , louder : " The Sea will provide . " Something mysterious and convincing in the litany draws the four of them up short for a minute , just listening . " The Sea will provide . " He leaves his children and goes down to the beach , combs it far out of sight , and returns triumphantly twenty minutes later , toting a flask washed up from a foreign coast , labelless but watertight , delivered up in the nick of time , rr drifting in for just such wounds : calamine . Artie forced his father 's one-word chunk of history to the surface . But far from being cathartic , the story of medicine from out of the sea  | disconcerted him even more this second time around . Nothing appealed to him less this evening than the idea that his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all been easy once . The interval of lost time came and visited on the front porch , saw the mess it had made , and instantly disowned its offspring . Artie looked at his father , stripped of whistle , and then at his own thin arms and legs , so unlike the ones that had pulled him out of the undertow . He had accomplished nothing in the intervening years except the steady conversion of early hope into adult confusion , with no indication of how the one had become the other . Pop mumbled , kapok-muffled . " Good man . " He sounded sicker than the three days ' symptoms warranted . " Knew you had it packed away . " Artie focused on the note of congratulations , ignoring the overtones . He decided that he had accumulated a hefty enough bank balance of contrition through the years to justify his gloating , just this once , over the strength of his memory . Recalling that lost summer , reminded of how his father had always combined just such taunts , pedagogy , and oracular beachcombing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again onto the silent lawn and let a feeling of All Clear come over him . Maybe Pop 's disease was something harmless , after all . It would n't be the first missed diagnosis in history . Whatever ailed the old lifeguard , Artie decided , the fellow sharing the porch with him this evening was still a good person . His heart filled with a magnanimity toward Dad that ordinarily rarely bothered him , and Artie at once wanted to do something special for the man . " Come on , big guy . Let 's go inside and deal some cards . " Among Ailene , Lily , Rachel , and Eddie-boy , they could easily scrape up another partnership . Dad often said he 'd made sure to father sufficient children always to be able to make up a table . Bridge allowed him to hold forth on statistics , to comment on the psychology of intimidation , to wheedle Lily or Ailene . And in this way , Artie could test his longstanding hypothesis that nothing administered to his father 's perennial illness as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health like going down heroically in Three No Trump . Artie stood and moved for the door . Lawn and streetlamp , a seaside summer , had taught the two of them all they were going to learn this evening . It was time , Artie felt , to return to the small consolation of  | family . Art was two steps to the door when he heard something that dropped him in place and overhauled his evening plans . His father was calling his name , but in another man 's voice . " Arthur , " he said , and , " Son . " He spoke the words sharply , each syllable rising up eerily by spectral fourths . He barely whispered , as if too big a twitch of the vocal cords might pitch him over a ledge that had just opened up underneath him . Something is happening , his father 's voice telegraphed . Something I do not want to go through by myself . At the same time , the tone carried an awful fascination , as if a frightened rare animal had appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted Artie to see without scaring . A salt-pillar glance back over Artie 's shoulder confirmed the worst . Pop lay on the displaced mattress , on neither one side nor the other nor even face down as Rachel had left him , but unnaturally on his back , shock-side up , staring up at the ceiling as if reading something there . He clearly saw something , a picture , a scene of terrifying and unnameable wonder , etched on the white boards . Before Artie could do anything to arrest it , the awful moment was on him . The air turned metallic as he breathed . Time thickened and molded over . Artie 's thighs refused to move , and he felt an overwhelming desire to sit down and do nothing , pinned at the bottom of an ocean of atmosphere . He had seen Pop 's attacks before , more than once . But this time , the hidden horror in his father 's voice blew his composure apart . Artie , from infancy , had a secret terror of sirens at night , of how easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , sirens clanging on all sides , his courage crumpled and his equanimity stripped off smoother than steamed wallpaper , with nothing but gaping plaster underneath . Averting his eyes from the white-wood ceiling , Artie assumed a matter-of-factness he did not feel . He returned to bedside , exhaling a bit of air in the closest motion he allowed himself to breathing . When he felt a small patch of earth resolidify under his feet , he risked a look at his father 's face : the man 's saucer eyes squeezed into a wince so severe that Art imitated it involuntarily . Dad 's hands clenched the rattan bed box , keeping his discarded body from falling farther . How could Artie have thought a bridge game possible , and only seconds before ? I le would now be lucky to get the body upstairs and in bed without going to pieces himself . He loosened his father 's clamped  | knuckles , saying , " Okay now , okay , " although his father had by now gone under , eyes closed , and could hear nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at solace . He sat at the foot of the bed and stroked his father 's flinty shins . He repeated one more " Okay , " which became an " Oh , Dadimo . " He was all at once taken with the urge to sing a refrain of " Many brave hearts are asleep in the Deep , " but he was unsure if the joke would be in good taste , even the already-questionable taste he 'd inherited from the man in question . He said instead , " The Sea will provide , " offering a little crumb of comfort , although his father could no longer hear him . He pinched a row of Dad 's hammer toes until they turned red , counting off , as he grabbed each in turn , " Eight , sixteen , twenty-four , " and a hesitant " thirty-two . " Then he grabbed the man 's torso and held on . As the fellow would not be able to feel him for some time , no one would be the wiser .  | Not surprisingly , the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectrum as on every other issue , they were not yet , early in November , even unanimous on whether Pop really needed diagnosing . As in all complex matters , the four Hobson babyboomers , although identical genetic material raised in the same household with militantly unfair equality , swore by four radically different verdicts of what , if anything , was wrong with Pop . They seemed to agree secretly never to reveal outwardly that they were blood relations , variations on a theme . Sixteen years earlier , when Arthur was only nine , Lily eight , Rachel seven , and Edward , the caboose , just two , Ailene carted all four in the two-toned Ford to a photographer 's shop in Teaneck , New Jersey , and came away with a montage of four oval faces in a frame , the kind still rampant in the early sixties . A duplicate print hung in the photographer 's shop window for a few seasons , drawing smiles from passersby who thought they could see in each pronounced forehead and high cheekbone an uncanny familial persistence . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , from the fourfold photograph , who had whose eyes and whose cheekbones . This favorite holiday talk made Rachel crack the same joke annually from age eight to fourteen : " If I 've got Pop 's nose , I better give it back before he blows . " What passed for sense of humor , at least , they shared congenitally . But the truly observant , which in the early days included only Mother , soon detected what changing facial bones made undeniable . Nobody had nobody 's nose . Out of the blue , each child grabbed a face by mail order , arriving at unique features for no other reason than being the only one of the batch to hit upon a particular chin . Inertial aunts continued to comment on the unnlistakability of the strain . But strangers , from the far *  | Easter forays into church , looking over the mixed bag of visages , pronounced a glottal " adoption " while choking down the host . Yet even the garden variety of faces seemed uniform compared to the personalities each staked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preprefabrication policy of rugged individualism . Rachel let a talent for language die on the vine because big brother Arthur showed the skill before her . She took up sports , retroactively curtailing older sister Lily 's perfection of the half gainer . Lily then shifted to an artistic sensitivity , which Artie had given up for his first Lent following puberty . The kids carved out claims on the map of special interests like so many colored wedges driven into blank Antarctica . The loser in this land grab was the latecomer . Eddie Jr. , already condemned by name to suffer littleRickyism without his father 's even having the excuse of being Cuban , arrived at adolescence to find no decent interests left , and had to take good-natured ineptness for his identity . The four-ovaled photo now bore only the faint traces of other scripts long since abandoned . De facto , the kids were n't going to give up their hard-won second , third , and fourth opinions on what ailed Eddie Sr. They had been raised from infancy under the illness 's milder forms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sightings , the sick stomachs , the fainting fits . They had heard , for years , their mother 's periodic , confidential " Your father is not well , " an explanation as inscrutable as the ailment itself . But Lily suffered the hope of periodic remission while Rach hid in good humor , Art kept ironic distance , and little Eddie stuck to fledgling optimism and kidding . Prescription remained a private patent , more individual temperament than observation . The complications of the last two weeks , Pop 's sudden and violent relapse into spells after years of relative health , could not trick them into unanimity . But if the children split on the causes of sickness , they agreed on one shared treatment : no one ever spoke a word of what was going on out loud . By unspoken agreement , they kept mum in public . During one of the rare times that they had touched on what they ought to do about the man 's steady deterioration , Lily ended up hurling Rach through a screen window . The boys , pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were only able to patch up by mutually agreeing that neither woman knew what the hell she was talking about . They were of the same face once again at least on how to handle the  | old man among themselves . And so , when he finished counting Dad 's hammer toes by eights , Artie calmed down and reminded himself that what had just happened was nothing that he had n't cleaned up after countless times . He stood up , tested his tendons , and went inside . There he ambushed Eddie Jr. , who was seeing how long he could bounce a Ping-Pong ball on a hot skillet before it melted . Artie grabbed little brother 's neck and squeezed . " I need your help transporting someone near and dear to you across state lines , sport . " Eddie 's face crumpled in fear , which he at once expertly oiled into a look of amused long-suffering . His eyebrows asked , " Again ? " although Eddie stayed silent . The two brothers walked to the porch , arms on each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best to grip it . They had worked together like this the summer before , toting ceramic tile into a trench dug out to the city 's main . They lifted their father 's bulk up off the bed , one man-child under each armpit . The passage up the stairwell was so cumbersome that the three bodies jammed for a moment and could not twist forward . Little Eddie called out , " Wait . I 've seen this one . Laurel and Hardy . The Piano Movers , right ? What do I win ? " He won , for the moment , a maniacally guilty laugh from his brother . Dad shocked them both by choosing that instant to regain awareness . " Have a little respect for the dead , " he said , starting the sentence inaudibly and ending it in full voice . His brisk return to speech so startled his sons that they pulled opposite ways at the turn of the stairs , popping the bottleneck . Dad carried on , " Oh , how sharper than a children 's teeth is " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mouth . " Cool out , Pop , " Eddie Jr . added , gently . " We got you . " Artie had a sudden urge to do violence to both father and brother : squeeze thumbs , wrench arms , throw somebody against the wall . He masked the impulse as he always did  --  by grinning pleasantly . A dish-breaker at age ten , Artie had since gotten self-control down to a science . At eighteen , he had timed his outbursts carefully for when they would take the opposition off guard and give the best results . At twenty-five , he had paired the physical spasm with the follow-up grin for so long that the desire to hurt father and brother for their inanity melted quickly into the self-defense of goodwill .  | lie boys got their father undressed and under the covers . Whatever Pop had seen only a few moments before faded back into the domestic landscape , retreated behind the billboards . The old man went down willingly with nothing further to say for himself than , " You guys are the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pop , " Eddie Jr . said , flicking off the light . Neither son moved to leave . Instead , they sat quietly , one on the floor , the other across the arm of a chair , two aging athletes agreeing to an informal time-out . They gathered themselves in the dark , listening . Soon came the subtle shift in breathing that marked their father 's departure into sleep . " Look at him , " Artie said , eyes adjusted to the dark . " He looks just like a boy of ten . " " Twelve , more like , " said Eddie Jr . " Have it your way , " Artie grinned . They went back downstairs . Lily lay in wait below . She 'd witnessed the whole proceedings , hiding in her room at the back of the house . Now she emerged to direct them into the kitchen . She gave them both a glass of her specialty : herbal tea of her own devising , a recipe she squirreled away in a spiral notebook under the chapter heading " Sixties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grimace reserved for acts of comfort . " We 'll only drink this stuff under one condition . You have to play pinochle with us . " Lily agreed reluctantly , although all three knew that attempting the game with her was largely an academic exercise . Every few tricks she had to stop and count suits , tapping her fingers on the table for all to hear . Mid-trick , she would ask , " What 's the rank again ? Ace , King , Ten ? " And Eddie Jr . would have to repeat exasperatedly , " Ace , Ten , King . " Somewhere between table talk and point counting , Lily risked a slow stroll onto forbidden territory . She began confidently enough , as if there were more ways to self-esteem than being able to keep track of what trumps were out . " I remember the first time I ever saw Dad have a spell , " she said . " We were still in the Brook Street house . I had just turned eight . " She might have been talking about being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " corrected Artie , pulling a card from his hand . " I was eight . " He checked her latest mistake firmly , another Ace-King-Ten . She scuffed a consonant in silence . " You 're wrong , as usual . I was in  | Mrs. Buntz 's class , and that was third grade , so I was eight . But we 'll let it slide . For the sake of pleasant conversation , we 'll say seven . Anyway , I was in that upstairs room with the dormers  --  remember ? ? getting in my weekly half hour of TV . Do you suppose we were the last children in the Northern Hemisphere to have our TV viewing rationed ? " " Wait a minute , " said Artie . Flapped by his sister 's patter , he 'd misjudged a trick . " That 's not the card I meant to pull . " " Laid is played , " Eddie Jr . said , keeping his glee as clinical as possible . At the same time , he filed away that old cardsharp 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off-color joke-off . Out loud , he added another favorite Hobson card-table adage : " Never send a boy to do a man 's job . " " I imagine we were , " said Lily , habituated to answering her own question . " I remember the color of the bedspread . The house smelled like pepper steak . " " The house smelled as a pepper steak smells , " corrected Artie , revenging himself for his wasted trump . " The house smelled like pepper steak . The television show was nonfiction , of course . We could watch two nonfiction shows a week , and doubling the allotment always seemed worth having to learn something . A travelogue  --  somewhere in Asia , I think , although I would n't have known Asia from Newark at the time . Five minutes into it Dad came in , which meant that you could n't enjoy the show anymore because he 'd quiz you on everything . How far is that country from here ? How long would it take an airplane flying five hundred miles an hour to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak there ? ' " Eddie Jr . contributed . " Do you know our country 's foreign policy in the area ? ' " Artie said , despite himself . Lily swelled and picked up speed . " But when they showed footage of this lost temple , for some reason he shut up . I can still see the place , the camera moving over it . Amazing : a ruin , but intact . No human had touched a stone for hundreds of years . A pack of monkeys had taken the place over , colonized it . A temple given up to gibbons . I remember thinking , at age eight , that it looked like the last record of civilization . Then suddenly : bang . Dad went down behind me , flat on his back . I 've never been so frightened before or since . I thought . . . God , I do n't know . I thought I had killed him , somehow , by what I was thinking . "  | Artie folded his cards , touched a finger to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lily enjoyed her brother 's rare commiseration . She should have left the empathy at that , more than she expected . But wanting one last shot at the topic , and feeling that pushing the point might lead , for once , to partial action , she added , " Do you think it 's epilepsy , or something ? " " It 's obviously not epilepsy , " Artie snapped , retrieving a second miscard from under Eddie 's fist , which the kid slammed down to prevent removal . Neither ' relented , and they ended up tearing a corner off the card . " But something like it , maybe ? " Lily said , retreating into the hypothetical . " That depends on what you mean by something like . ' We already know he 's got something like ' epilepsy . It 's called a family . " All at once , from his unassuming slouch , Eddie Jr . demanded , " Why the hell does n't he go see a doctor ? " The outburst surprised the two older children , so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They exchanged sardonic looks . " The human body is a marvelous machine , ' " Artie said , in a fair imitation . " It has had a million more years ' experience in detection and correction than the boys at the Mayo Clinic , ' " completed Lil . Pop 's distaste for doctors , his aversion to organized health care , his empirical respect for the mechanism , was one more strange twist of the man 's arch rationality . " Why do n't we force him , then ? " Artie took on the task of educating the dewy-eyed . Patient , patronizing , he said , " I do n't suppose you remember The Abscess ? You were just a log in your father 's eye at the time . He came to breakfast one morning looking like he already had a meal stuffed in his right cheek pouch . I 'm talking golf ball . And damn him if he was n't tough enough to pull off a lesson on the theoretical approach to pain . The monster did n't even take an aspirin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have passed out . But he : he just sat there doing this comic bit . I wish I had one on the other side , too . I could be Nixon . ' Canadian bacon and a hard biscuit , with an entire molar going off like dynamite in the back quarter of his jaw . Two days later , it 's gone . Successfully healed through calculated neglect . Return to Normalcy . "  | Lily took up the slack . " He loves those newspaper exposes about people going into clinics with kidney stones and coming out of surgery on a platter . It 's a statistical wager for him : the odds are better if you do n't screw with the equilibrium . " There lay the heart of the problem . They had slipped easily into card-table rage against the man 's evasiveness , and without changing conversational tones they had ended up somehow adopting the enemy 's logic with no one noticing . But Eddie Jr . must have heard the false turn , because he attacked them with a violent burst before he too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He stood up , flailing . " That we should let him treat passing out the same as a toothache ? That just because he makes a theory out of suffering , that we have to too ? " He stopped long enough to notice Artie waving his fingers at him , a facetious , down-boy ripple of digits . Eddie took his seat again , shyly . " I mean , do we got ta wait until he ca n't object , and then carry him into the ER ? Great . Then we have to listen to the surgeon say how amazing it is that the guy was still walking around alive for so long . " " What we 're saying , " Lily explained sympathetically , " is that your father 's second-favorite literary passage in the whole world is the bit from Tristram Shandy ? I live in a constant endeavour to fence against the infirmities of ill health ... ' ... and other evils of life , ' " Artie assisted , although Eddie Jr . could have done the same . ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite never having tried to memorize it . Sheer repetition on Pop 's part . She smirked , despite herself , remembering his first-favorite speech , Kipling 's " If , " done at an insanely high speed . If you can keep your head , she tested herself , lost to the conversation . When all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you . Yes : she could probably finish that one , too . Artie did n't think that was what they meant at all . What they were really saying was that addressing Dad 's illness clinically was not step one . But he thought it wiser not to break up the rare consensus he had with Sis . So he said , " What we 're saying is that your father has a considerable jump on us . If we go to him now , he 'll laugh . He 'll just point out , correctly , that he 's been passing out harmlessly for far longer than we 've WOrricd what to do about it . " I , ' , ddic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the your father ' all of  | a sudden ? You two trying to blame him on me now that he 's gone whacko ? " Lily , back from mental poetry , countered , " Can you give us one good reason why we should n't ? " Ten minutes of talk with the boys , and she inevitably picked up their sardonic style . The moment of truth or consequence passed as subtly as it had arrived . No one knew who was on who 's side ; Pop had confused them again . On one point , though , they were still allied . They had all skirted what they all knew to be the real issue : none had the courage to take on Dad 's confidence game head on . " Damn right we 're blaming the relapse on you , " Artie chipped in . " After all , do n't you think it 's more than a little suspicious that Pop should wait to have hallucinations again , after all these years , until the very month you have your . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Eddie was interrupted in his attempt to use the blade edge of the Jack of Diamonds on his brother 's jugular by the return of Mother and the missing Rachel . Ailene closed the front door after her and butted it shut repeatedly with her behind . The big oak slab had not closed properly since the early part of the century , and refused to cooperate at this late date . Through the runway leading from the kitchen , the card players saw that both Mother and Sister were red and raw from the night cold . Artie thought : they slipped out the back way just before the drama broke . He knew that they could n't have known the fit was coming on , yet their technical innocence irritated him all that much more . He demanded : " Where did you two run to ? " Rachel shuffled kitchenward , left wrist to hip , right arm extended . She grabbed Artie and echoed , " Two-run-too . . . two-one-two . . . " He wrestled out of her dance clinch and asked again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou thine sister 's kipper snack ? " Mother adjudicated , coming down the runway , rubbing her shoulders and burring . She had dropped fifteen pounds after the birth of each child and now nothing stood between the elements and her internal organs . " We were at the Northern Lights . And ? " She paused , walked over to the gas stove , and threw open a burner . She placed a kettle over the stove , indulging in the ritual more for the dangerous blue halo of flame than from any real desire for boiling water . " And , " she said again , her dramatic pause revealing itself as the fake reticence of a little girl who ca n't wait to give her news . " They carded me . " Snnug , she skipped over  | to Eddie and pushed his nose in , making a smock sound with her cheeks as she did . " And you showed him your license ? " " I had to .

But he thought it a particularly ignominious blot on the family name ( not that the family name could n't use another blot here and there to touch it up and restore the symmetry ) that his mother , being carded , should dutifully surrender her two forms of ID . " I suppose , Mother dear , that you got up there and fruged , or whatever you young folks are doing this year , with the best of them . " " Do n't be ridiculous , " Ailene demurred loudly . " I 'm no spring chicken , and you know it . " Then why , the question hung about the kitchen , begging for someone to ask , did you fail to see through the heartless practical joke on the part of the doorman ? Casting about for something to sober her , something to sting her back to the hard facts of that evening , Eddie undid the damage to his Irish pug and said , " You two ducked out just in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both content and style of delivery .

" Mom stopped in mid-sashay , searched her children for any sign of willful falsehood , and , finding none , did a distinctly undancelike ball change down the runway and upstairs . Had the Teaneck photographer been present , he might have captured the remaining four in an uncanny second set of ovals  --  Then and Now  --  or , more likely , given up the project as stranger than fiction . Artie got up from the table and shut off Mom 's irrelevant gas burner . 1 le poured the steaming kettle water into the sink . When he finally spoke , he kept his head sinkward , addressing the porcelain . " Bedside manner brings out the best in her . " Lily switched alliances in a second . She glared at him , not the universal women 's look of sovereign dismissal of men but one tailored expressly for this male . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soft as imaginable , and mimed her mother 's exit step into her bedroom at the hick of the house . Artie nnnnblcd a confusus of mock Latin just loud enough to hear .  | " Mea culpa , mea maxima . . . " In a Catholic , the act might have passed for a blasphemy of contrition , but in a Lutheran it was sheer , scholastic showing off . He fiddled with a faulty washer on the cold faucet , recalling a story his father frequently repeated at table , sometimes varying in the particulars but always fundamentally the same , about how Grandfather , who had died before Artie was born , had come to the Cure . The oldest of the Eddies , Irish by background and temperament , had taken as his bride a Mediterranean woman , one of whose eight personalities ( the traditional four better and four worse ) imagined that the best way to get a leaky faucet fixed was to appear every fifteen minutes and demand that the huddled immigrant refuse get off the couch and plumb . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want that drip fixed ? I 'll fix the drip for you , forever ! " He flew into the kitchen and smashed his fist against the offending pipe . Opening his hand , he was amazed to find a steady stream of blood and bone joining the water dripping into the basin . He vowed on the spot never to allow another drop of alcohol in his house . According to Pop , Granddad had only to remember that color combination  --  maroon on off-white  --  to keep his vow . Now , so many years after the reformation , Artie smiled , thinking how simple that cure had been compared to what the present generation would need . He felt Rachel pinch him in the bicep , whispering " Crabs " as she passed behind him and sat down at the table across from Eddie Jr . Little brother sat motionless , head in hands , agonized at causing his mother additional and unneeded grief . Rachel took a pitch pipe out of her pocket , blew a C , and sang , to the tune of " Goodnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't cry , Nedski , Do n't cry , Wedski , We 'll let you take the blame . Eddie , whose face indeed formed an unwitting , paint-by-numbers version of St. Sebastian , came back to himself . Blushing , he tried to grab the pitch pipe from her hand , but failed . He put his elbow on the table , challenging her to an arm wrestle . Rachel grabbed his palm in both of hers , sprang to her feet , and began to twist his wrist off . When lie jerked  | free , Rach smiled sweetly and said , in her best singsong **26;149;TOOLONG voice , " I win . " Artie , at the touch of his younger sister , felt his static thoughts fall off and leave him temporarily in the clear . Maybe Rach was right : consign Dad to his own muck-making and go on with the work of being well disposed toward the world . He tried to show the other two that he , too , was ready to join back in . He put his voice into treble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if you 're going to kill each other , to do it in the yard . I just washed . . . " But when he turned from the sink , there in front of him was the object of his mockery , looking shook . Artie thought for a moment that Dad had taken the long-expected last turn for the worst . But it was just the opposite , and equally incomprehensible . " I thought you kids meant he had a spell when we were out . " " He did . Bad as I 've ever seen . Tigers on the ceiling . Eddie and I had to take him upstairs and put him to bed . " Artie gestured toward the table for proof that he was n't lying . Eddie nodded concurrence . " Then how do you explain that he 's all right now ? " " All right ? " Artie answered , despite his mother 's having spent two dozen years telling him never to answer a question with a question . " He 's sitting up in bed . " Ailene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Happy . Dictating . Working on Hobstown. "  |  | Everything we are at that moment goes into the capsule : a camera , a wall switch , a safety pin . The task , a tough one , is to fit inside a ten-foot , streamlined missile a complete picture of us Americans , circa 1939 . Glass and stainless steel , a silver dollar , a toothbrush . A stroke of genius , including that toothbrush  --  an item so common it might have been overlooked . If people of the future learn everything about us except for toothbrushes , we are lost . The missile aims at the future . How far in the future ? Exactly fifty centuries , five thousand years . Fair officials sink the missile underground , not to be opened until the year 6939 . Bud counts backward the same number of years . In 3061 B.C. , Egyptians experimented with the plow , Sumerians with wheeled vehicles and writing . Five thousand years is a big leap for a boy of thirteen . But if the first step was big , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theme of this year 's World 's Fair : each year speeds the rate of change . That 's why this message in a bottle is so crucial , a note from ourselves to our later selves , when all is forgotten . The cache includes a tape measure , of course . A can opener . The alphabet in type . Soon Bud sees that fitting all America into the tube would take a tube the size of all America . But thanks to the recent invention of microfilm , we can fit into this space the blueprint for something far larger . On film , we include our favorite magazines , dictionaries , atlases , technical manuals . We slip the Lord 's Prayer in three hundred languages between photos of baseball and poker games . We pack a healthy regimen of news , the same newsreels that supply matinee instruction for boys of thirteen . We choose , from thousands of miles of film , Roosevelt speaking , a Miami fashion show , the bombing of Canton by the Japanese . Bud feels the endeavor take on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it confuses him , too , about the dominant tense . We make tomorrow 's archaeology today . How can that be ? Bud Middleton visits the 1939 New York World 's Fair in Flushing Meadow , Queens . He comes with his family from their home in the American Midwest . Dad , Mom , Babs , Bud , and Grandma . The entire twelve-hundred-acre miniature country floors Bud . Its theme , " Building the World of Tomorrow , " knocks him over . He begins his tour at the park 's Theme Center , with its seven-hundred-foot Trylon needle and twohundred-foot Perisphere containing the moving platforms , piped symphonies , projected images , and precision models of Democracity , the perfect , planned metropolis . From there he gravitates to the Rotolactor at Borden 's Dairy World , missing that it is just Elsie being milked on a merry-goround . He speeds through the Court of Peace , the gleaming buildings from Greece , Poland , and Czechoslovakia . He can not afford to dawdle at the League of Nations exhibit in the far corner of the park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred exhibits . He catches Planters 's " Mr. Peanut and His Family Tree , " as well as Ford 's " A Thousand Times Neigh , " a horse's-eye view of the auto . He waits in line to thrill to the famous General Motors Futurama . He indulges his adolescence for a half hour at the Aquacade , Jungle Land , and Nature 's Mistakes pavilions over in the Amusement Zone . Even getting stuck with his mother at the top of the Life Saver Parachute Drop for three hours , although traumatic , can not mar the most astonishing , eye-opening vacation of his life . The fair culminates for Bud in the Westinghouse pavilion , with Elektro , the talking , cigarette-smoking robot , and , above all , with the time capsule , that torpedo locked on a target five thousand years off . That this exhibit is his favorite stands to reason , for Bud , Mr. and Mrs. Middleton , Grandma , and even the charming Babs are themselves Westinghouse creations . The mythical Middleton family is manufactured to serve as model Americans at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trade books , magazine ads , even a feature-length film put out by Westinghouse promoting the exhibit that in turn promotes the immense and undeniable benefits of Westinghouse 's product , the product Bud 's dad calls " science 's greatest gift to the world of the future . " " But wo n't the capsule deteriorate in all that time ? " Mother asks . But  | science solves even that . A Westinghouse magic substance called " cupaloy " and a special sealant gas ensure that safety razor and wall switch and one thousand pictures and ten million words will survive their long passage intact . " What if folks five thousand years from now ca n't read English ? " Bud asks , displaying the practical turn of mind of bright young Americans of 1939 , Westinghouse sees to that , including in the capsule an English lexicon with pictures , a Rosetta stone for teaching the language from scratch . They distribute , to countless universities and libraries across the country , microfilmed multilingual instructions and maps for locating and disinterring the capsule if it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Somewhere in Bud 's still budding brain he fails to see how any amount of gloss will help creatures from the future reconstruct what the newsreels of Jesse Owens 's 1936 Olympic victories mean . He can not imagine conveying to an alien of five thousand years from now what is obvious to the Middletons : why no time capsule of America in 1939 could be complete without a Mickey Mouse plastic cup . Yet Bud Middleton approves the anthology of objects , especially one final bit of recursion . The capsule contains a newsreel documenting that capsule world in miniature , the World 's Fair itself . For all its elevating vision of the promise of tomorrow , something terribly wrong with the 1939 World 's Fair escapes Bud . A tremendous gulf splits it down the middle . It epitomizes all we have done well . It is the abyss of insipidness . It is urgent , high-toned , and aware  --  the most magnificent civil-engineering project ever , transforming an ash dump into a model of the future . But just down the pastel avenue , shading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the place degenerates into a nudie show where near-naked girls tussle with octopi . One exhibitor 's film , The City , asks of the world we take for granted , " Who built this place ? What put us here ? And how do we get out again ? " Bud has no answer , being just thirteen and himself a creation of that same fair . He has just the degree of insight the fair gives him and no more . What world do the Middletons return to after their film is over ? A world where the family newspaper gives more room to church socials than to the . Hine Workers ' strike or the collapse of Slovakia . A world where Shirley  | Temple , the number-one box-office champion for four years , has just lost her title to Mickey Rooney . The two most popular stars in the most popular medium ever in the world have an average age of fifteen . Bud , at thirteen , with only a few magazine appearances and one second billing in a trade-show feature , is over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its most magnificent year ever . Never again will it come close to matching this year 's product . Gone With the Wind takes the Oscar . But it has still - competition from Goodbye Mr. Chips , Ninotchka , Stagecoach , The Wizard of Oz , Mr. Smith Goes to Washington , Wuthering Heights , Dark Victory , and Juarez . Even as the movie industry peaks it sickens , although it wo n't show the symptoms for years . This incredible flowering is not simply escapism from economic hardship . Times have been far harder without producing anywhere near this burgeoning bouquet of other worlds . Movies somehow replace the Middletons ' lost hold on the real place , now too desperate and absentee to feel . Swing is King , a sound that has Bud and Babs almost hysterical with rhythm . " Deep in a Dream " tops Variety 's Hot 15 . Television makes its debut at the Fair : Bud stands in front of a camera and does a monologue for his folks . Radio holds an uncontested hammerlock on the Middletons ' hearts and minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an astigmatic glimpse of the larger landscape . On September 1 , 1939 , Mrs. Middleton and Grandma hear an announcer conclude an extended description of Hitler 's morning Blitzkrieg into Poland by saying , " We should like to express our appreciation again at this time to . . . the makers of Ivory Soap , sponsors of Life Can Be Beautiful . " In November , Babs Middleton 's copy of Photoplay runs an article called " Clouds Over Hollywood . " It reads : The crowds were laughing as they emerged from the premiere of " The Women , " gay with the sparkle of watching a gay , sparkling picture , happy with that sense of well-being within the industry which comes from the knowledge that another hit is born . Then , as they reached the street , the newsboys ' cries reached their ears . A stunned moment before the full impact of the news struck home . Bitter silence as realization came . Then a growing murmur of restlessness and fear  | and heartache for the many strangers within the gates who for so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Boyer ? " " What of Niven ? " " And Richard Greene ? " " Hollywood , " Babs reads , an anxious rawness in her throat for Pepe Le Moko , hero of Algiers , " is face to face with grim reality . " Across the living room , Mr. Middleton settles into his overstuffed chair with the November 13 issue of Time . In it , he learns that 1939 has proved the final defeat of appeasement as a credible policy for establishing and enforcing cooperation among nations . Now the world 's last hope is Tit for Tat . He reads that Lloyd 's of London offers insurance against death and dismemberment from aerial bombing : one pound per one hundred pounds ' coverage . He reads a scrap of doggerel currently making the rounds : Hitler is a gangster , Daladier 's a bore , Chamberlain 's a counterfeit , And so 's the new world war ! But the piece that slams home , that jumps off the magazine page at him , shouts in great letters , " unprepared . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you unprepared . " An advertisement for Quaker State antifreeze . Dad resolves to take action the next day , correct his neglect , and avert what might turn into a family disaster if he leaves it any longer . Upstairs , Bud struggles with a letter to his friend Ed . " Dear Eastie , " he begins . " Seems like forever since we met last spring at the Fair . " He stops and chews on his pencil end . He stares into the shedding trees outside his window . When the gleaming pavilions once more reform in front of his eyes , he grows animated and writes quickly . " But that 's a bat 's blink compared to 5,000 years , huh , buddy ? " Or rather , Ed , in his home in Jersey , stops on a November afternoon and wonders what the Middletons might be up to . He has met them only once , in the Westinghouse film , but their future seems somehow crucial to the boy . He knows , without knowing , that something terribly wrong  | infects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's showdown has supposedly come and gone already , twenty-one years before  --  averted in the eleventh month of the eleventh day at the eleventh hour . Now he feels what no one admits : that we are about to drift into darkness again . He reads about it , hears about it , waits for it , but neither he nor anyone he knows has the least notion of what to do about it . But the real crisis of 1939 is not just his helplessness in the face of the coming violence , the final , unthinkable crimes that will end up , as always , harmless in history books . Little Eddie 's great terror is that his life is more benign and beneficent than ever . An unimaginable gap opens between the place people make to live in and the place springing up all around them and despite them . Enjoying life like everyone else might actually make things worse . The possible no longer keeps pace with the necessary . Little no longer divides cleanly into Big . Eddie Hobson no longer has anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the only one to fall out and say no . That is the subterranean evil rising from the sidewalk cracks behind him as he pedals down the street . What can Edward Hobson do , being just thirteen and himself a child of the darkward drift ? He is just a beginner in his own life . He is only as insightful as the world that made him . He ca n't be expected to sew up the rift running right down the middle of his paper-routed world . But to live through his remaining days , he must . The sun shines crisply if weakly on his autumn afternoons . The wind creates its allaying breezes . Light glances off grass lots and squints under bridges . All is the same as in any other year , except the balance between livable , awful , and real . Something sinister sits open on the Hobson coffee table . In an ad in the May 15 issue of Life , Grandma Middleton stands in front of a model of the time capsule and regrets , " It 's too bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that make our lives so much more pleasant . " " Yes , " says her daughter , Bud 's mother . " Like refrigerators , irons , toasters and vacuum cleaners . If they do n't have those things 500() years from now I certainly would n't want to be living then . " Her grammar reflects the current confusion over the dominant tense , what light is about to go out , what the capsule must urgently preserve . Edward Hobson , in northern suburban jersey , pure product of this  | year 's World 's Fair , goes to a matinee of that other Oz : Oz . The show begins with this year 's Academy Award  --  winning cartoon , Disney 's Ugly Duckling . Then a newsreel , one that did not make the Westinghouse time capsule , on the first decimation of Europe and Asia . A big leap to make , even for a boy of thirteen .  |  | The local crisis passed , as Lily knew it would . As always , Hobson 's crisis was that there was no crisis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hearing of Dad 's instant return to health , Lily watched the others pump their lips like astonished aquarium fish , then dissolve a few minutes later , spread into the house 's corners to rule over independent , empty countries . Later , she sat by candlelight in her room , putting her hand to the draft where the window sash had long ago warped . Dad fixed the wood once , but it warped again . The flaw was now part of her room , like the sagging bookshelves and the cozily threadbare rug . The imperfections made things bearable . Lily put her hand against the cold , glass skin standing between herself and November . Her family did not suspect the expense their mute calls for help caused her . She alone saw the emergency afoot . She had always underwritten the negligence of others through private deficit spending , abiding her sister 's cute obtuseness , suffering Artie 's indignities in private , and putting Little Eddie 's ignorance on tab . She spoke the family code , cracked the required caustic jokes , but all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But tonight , Lily felt her outlay reach a debit ceiling . When her mother and sister had asked her along for Ladies ' Night , Lily had affected a mock shuffle and palsied palm . " You girls go dancing , and do n't worry about me . " Rachel had jumped all over her , saying , " Look , Sister . You 've been nursing some serious old-maid qualities over the last couple of annums . " Lily had spit back , " Old maid ? I 've earned it . Come talk to me when you 've been where I 've been . " At the quarter-century mark , she 'd been through the mill twice already . I lcr father was borderline certifiable , her mother a martyr . She  | herself was divorced , careerless , and without prospects in either . Worst , she had three siblings incapable of facing the coming disaster . Nor was she herself ready to go after the man . Not just yet . She lifted the stereo needle gingerly onto an old favorite LP , an early-seventies vocal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feel as if there were some possibility of new air that everyone had overlooked . The sound of the familiar tunes always made it seem that something was about to happen , something simple and wonderful . But after two tracks , the chordal formula sounded dated and precious . Without warning , she had to go for a walk , get out of the house 's residual static . She killed the phono , stubbed out what remained of a burned-down joss stick , went to the front-hall closet , got her winter coat , put it on , thought better of it , and replaced it with her lighter autumn one . Then she set off through the front door her mother had butted shut just two hours before . Three steps into the lawn , she concluded that Precinct 19 was right in their legal battle with her father : some Hobson had better do something about all those unraked leaves . So she lay down and rolled in them . When she at last stood up , she picked off leaves , leaving a few oranges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed the front walk out to the street . Turning to survey the family plot , she grew grateful for one thing : whatever indignities her family made her endure , they had never once graced their parade of exchanged houses with one of those horse-tether replicas topped by a miniature coach-and-four announcing " The Hobsons ' , " or worse , " The Hobson 's . " For in reality , it never came down to the plural or the bastard plural possessive . It was always the Hobson . The man turned the We and They of their endless bridge scorecards into You and You and You and You . He 's upstairs working on Hobstown . Lily wandered away from One-OhThree toward town along Second Street 's unnecessarily rustic cobblestones . She reminded herself that there was , in fact , no such place as Hobstown : an Erewhon , an Emerald City of her father 's devising . The place she had to navigate was De Kalb , Illinois , a corn town sixty-five miles due west of Chicago , Birthplace of Barbed Wire . Pop always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding out where history dropped you down . Yet the same man , trapped iii phantoms , lived for Hobstown , a makeshift , escapist fantasy , as far as she  | could make out . She had her own , of course . She lived for names , and the names of places . The disaster of her own marriage lay in her having chosen Wayne Leeds not for any redeeming or damning qualities in the man himself but for the delicious alliteration that matrimony worked on her : Lily Leeds . It came off the tongue with poetic perfection , and who could help but honor such an offer ? But Lily Leeds  --  perfect sound , perfect name  --  had led , after only ten months and ultimate violence , back here , imperfect place , imperfect town . In the end , she had nothing to show for the escapade but broken furniture , no remedy for the mistake except to come home to Hotel Hobson , a bed and board whose rates required putting up with a father 's black humor as he slowly did away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her father had lost his hold on Here . He could no longer calm her , as he had when she was young , with " Do n't be afraid . I 'm Here , and so are you . " All she could do was embrace this flat , pragmatic state , layered north to south like a seasonal parfait , where three hundred miles along any road , roads that cut across county lines in compound scars , advanced or reversed by half a month the degree that next season 's temperature had homesteaded the area . Last week was still intact a short drive south of her , December some seven hundred miles north , rolling down on her at a fixed rate . And in spring , May rolled north from Cairo at the state 's southernmost tip . Then she watched farmers plant their thousand-acre maws , betting on when the best weather would break . Green systematically erased the state 's black cipher in a northward wave , spring 's parfait-fuse . De Kalb waited under snow blankets with a practiced patience until , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been white once . Another month brought the double insult of 90 percent humidity and 100 degrees . Lily walked north , rushing December by several seconds , concluding that The Hobsons and one false Leeds were the only flesh west of the Fox River that did not make a living off the land . They were neither harvesters nor harvester-hybrid developers nor even , anymore , teachers of harvesters-to-be . They alone neither toiled nor spun , sowed , or reaped . They were stranded without practical skills , beached on the blessed black fields , impounded forever at Fifth and Main with no meal 's of getting out .  | Though outwardly they showed no mark . They lived in a house identical to the dozens she now passed . De Kalb 's standard model : a white , wooden A-frame with pitched roof and screen porch added two years before the War for Democracy . Once her favorite joke was to tell anyone who gave her a lift home , " That 's my house . The white one with the pitched roof , up there on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it funny , like saying that Granddad 's grave in the photo of Flanders was the white stone cross with the dates on it . She rarely made the joke anymore . Their home , like all others , wore its garland of meters , meting out trickles of electricity , water , gas . The spin of dials marked the only evidence of change , the only proof that something inside the house had indeed altered from yesterday . Their door , like its neighbors ' , already wore a winter wreath of Indian corn and gourds , products of the world 's richest earth . Mother , a genius of protective coloration , made their doorway blend in , hiding the fact that theirs marked the den of another species . From a hundred gourded doors in a few more hours , the air stinking of leaves and the sky taking on the color of a conch , interchangeable widows in slippers and gowns would put their hands to the cold stoop to retrieve the morning news . Her family would be waking , too . But safely back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having completed her effort for this day . She passed a Pentacostal barn whose sandwich board announced Sunday 's Special : BRICKS OF RELIGION . Across the way lay the town 's sole memorial , a garden-variety monument to the homegrown war dead . Twisted committee logic selected for the marker one of the agents of massacre : a tank of the Ardennes variety . She passed the town 's second-greatest claim to historical fame : the only place in North America where two state highways and a railroad track intersected . On the far side of the tracks , she loitered for the expected late freight , to hear the rich sixth chords it always issued . When the train tooled by on timetable , she identified the chord out loud : " Andrews Sisters . " Her father had formed her knowledge of music , as of so much else . The town looked more movie-proppish than ever at this late hour . The row of retail outlets one block deep along either side of the main drag held no interest for her . She hooked left , picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place , the family blamed her for their still being here . They lay the responsibility , under the guise of good humor , squarely on her : if Lily had not chosen to attend the local land-grant college just after the family 's arrival , De Kalb would have been just another four-year whistle-stop like all the others . This joke was especially cruel , as the choice was n't hers . Lily had intended to follow Artie 's lead in attending an Eastern public university , Dad 's school , the " family 's school , " as Pop ironically called it . " The university that the Hobsons have always attended . " Dad and Artie were the only two Hobsons who 'd ever gone on to school . But Lily capitulated , giving up her choice at the last minute , the day before she was to fly back East . She was about to travel in two directions : forward into adulthood , and back to the place of her girlhood , the place she had loved before the Hobsons had started their long life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savored that delicious smorgasbord of possibilities that life becomes when trimming down worldly possessions to two suitcases . When Ailene walked in on her during the bag-pack , Lily motioned to the wardrobe that had not made the final cut and asked giddily , " Oh , Mother ! Who was it wore this chartreuse , and those floppy collars ? Certainly I never had such taste . " Ailene sat down quietly , extinguishing her daughter 's excitement . Lily felt a wave of shame at delighting in something her mother had never done . But that was not the problem . Ailene , who had never dreamed of trying the same trick on Artie when it had been his turn to go , remarked offhandedly , " If only you were n't starting off to school just now . " Lily instantly understood the tacit code : the man on the kapok , whose condition that summer had once again flared . Lily stopped in mid suitcase-stuff and knew that her careful , curatorial job of packing was irrelevant , that she would never leave . At that moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciated . Without protest , she changed her plans . The culprit responsible for the episodes timed them with the same heavy-handed burlesque behind the old joke about the family 's school , I I0hson U. Her father lived in vignettes and thought in maxims . Lily is called Dad 's favorite pedagogical aphorism , fired off when any of his  | charges committed a hasty conclusion : " All Indians walk in single file . At least the one I saw did . " A oneliner if ever there was one . No generalizations can be trusted . Least of all this one . The precise mix of meanings Dad injected into each of these gags contained so many unrelated and conflicting ingredients that Lily had long ago given up trying to pin him down . He kidded and ridiculed ; he was deadly earnest . He got to the heart of the urgency , only to slide off into sarcasm . He threw away lines that distilled everything he knew . And when survival itself was at issue , Dad uncorked a cliche that meant nothing and everything all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't get away with it . Yet he always did . " We always let him , " Lily said out loud to the empty street . " At least the We I saw did . " So when her mother stopped her short with " just now , " Lily unpacked her bag and enrolled in the town 's normal college , one of those institutions that damns itself to mediocrity by adding a compass point to its name . She chose to study special education . But her undeclared major was campus radicalism , a field retreating from its high-water mark of the previous decade . Everyone had some alternative to things as they are , some escape from everyday limbo . Lily 's was to live in a year when raw history scraped open the surface of things and made it seem that something else could happen . This demure woman , who for twenty years had spent all her waking hours with a paint box , on her first Philosophy of Education take-home final declared that " making even one colored mark on a blank piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " More than a revolt : an appeal for grace . All human beings were due a full accounting , but they had to ask for it . Art was a way of asking . That , at least , was what she had had in mind when , totally in the dark at eighteen , she settled on special education with emphasis on fine arts . To teach the wordless another kind of speech , a way of articulating and demanding : that , she felt sure , was certainly worth studying . Eighteen , just Edski 's age . And now still no farther along than he . She did well her first year at school . But within a year she made the staggering discovery that " developmentally disabled " and " emotionally impaired " were simply euphemisms for what almost everybody , both within the profession and without , still thought of as retards . Certainly no one bought her belief that it was sufficient to get her charges to n1:Ike  | colored marks on paper . " Well intentioned , but misguided " was the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ byword of the day . The borderline nonnormals were turned loose into public life , the moderates attended to , and the severes pharmaceutically maintained . But by the time Lily made this discovery , she was committed . Her father 's daughter , she could not stop halfway . All she could do was finish the degree and watercolor for her own sanity , between educational colloquia . The allure of collegiate unrest also proved disappointing . Things had grown so comparatively calm by the early seventies that one scarcely remembered the war was still going on . Her generation had waited for her to arrive to deny that anything needed protesting . More than one cafeteria debate she had incited ended with the enemy insisting that activists were only kidding themselves . The prevailing argument was that the present had achieved a permanent state of militarization , so why bitch about a magnesium brush fire ? This was , Lily knew , the Voting Fallacy that the Hobson had once given his kids as topic for a table debate . No matter which candidate I like , the fallacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My scrap of litter is not the problem ; it 's the mountain already made by the other three and a half billion . Or : one air-conditioner more or less will not rescue or deplete the doomed ozone layer . So why should I swelter for a virtuous but impotent ideal ? Lily knew that the argument led to more air-conditioners , but it sounded so unimpeachable , she could not penetrate it and point out the error . Activism , when sufficient of her friends refused it credence , did seem irrelevant . It was only viable if everybody agreed it was . But doing iiothing was complicity . She might have asked Dad to reveal the fallacy , the flaw in the logic . But during her first year , Dad was in no shape for dialectics . She would not have gone to him anyway ; that would have involved admitting that she had missed the point of the lesson the first time around . Yet there were still enough of the dispossessed hanging around in I , iheral Arts programs for Lily to take arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of resistance , one last act of articulation . In the spiing of 1972 , when talk of an impending peace pact was everywhere in the air , lily and a commando gang of underclassmen prepared , under  | cover of the night , a reminder that the president , even at that threshold moment , was mining North Vietnamese harbors . With a hydrogen canister commandeered from Chemistry , some string and party balloons obtained over the counter , and a handful of stones dug out of an unwitting accomplice 's backyard , the covert band went about their protest . Just before sunrise , they set up the gas canister alongside the lagoon in the middle of campus and began inflating . Except for one lunatic who waved his cigarette around and made jokes about the Hindenburg , everything went smoothly . Filling each balloon with hydrogen and gluing it to a stone , the special-forces unit sank each sphere to the bottom of the pond . Asleep in the deep . By eight o'clock that morning , early classgoers saw something remarkable : colored balls , one by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifting up into the air , each with the word Haiphong written on it in a deliberate if not to say artistic hand . But all that activism now seemed so many years ago . Lily looked off to her left , where two of the college 's taller buildings shot up out of the vacancy of fields . The fields were harvested now , brought in like clean linen off the line . The campus had reverted to the days of an MBA for the boys and an MRS for the girls . Since the mock harbor-mining , she too had done her bit to build up equity in the status quo . She 'd tried the tie that binds , and after its dissolution , moved back home . Those more assimilated of her classmates had simply figured it out before her : in the wider conflagration , what could one objection work ? Not very much , she now suspected . Best bury your talent these days in the ground , where , if it failed to cumulate or compound , it was at least , in Minuteman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had mined the Haiphong harbor that sat in the lagoon that lay on the campus that taught the town that barbed wire built still could not reconcile herself to the here in all this here . Ludicrous , that her family should end up where they were  --  the only ones for miles who could n't say what roguing and winter wheat were . She wished as she walked that what troubled her father had been as straightforward and unexotic as cerebral malaria or dissociative schizophrenia . If only he had chosen jaundice , a disease with clinical rationale . The only predictable pattern to Eddie Sr. 's illness was that after the initial , frenetic fit-period  | passed , usually in ten days , he would pull himself together , deny that anything out of the ordinary had happened , go back to work on his pet urban-development project , and then get the urge to take a lower paying , more obscure job farther west , deeper in the interior . Dad island-hopped from Jersey to Philly to Cinci to De Kalb , carting along wife and kids for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on here . Lily had always believed her father 's job changes  --  clearly successive demotions in the eyes of the NEA if not in his  --  were separate from the rest of his sickness . His spells had cost him a job or two , but she had never before suspected cause and effect . Yet tonight , the wandering and the fits seemed cut from whole cloth , two aspects of the same trip , one from which , the unconsulted specialists were sure to concur , he was unlikely to return . The folks had started out on the East Coast , and in twenty years ' searching for a healing climate had exhausted every spot up to the Mississippi . Each major illness announced a move . The pattern would have left De Kalb behind long ago , as soon as Dad was well enough to move . But Ailene had come and watched Lily pack , saying , " If only you were n't leaving just now . " And then , " because Lily 's in school here , " they had bought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ca n't miss it . She had stayed for their sake , and they blamed the place on her . It was not her fault that the Hobsons were always in the middle of a " just now . " It occurred to her that they were once again in a " just now " just now . But at that moment Lily could no longer consider Dad 's migration . She had arrived at the place she was after . A house : not white ; no pitched roof . Alone among all structures in that insular , white-wood town , it partook of an exaltation of lacework , a swell of rotundas , a badinage of balustrades , bricks , ironwork , and bayed glass . She had come to the home of a Master Elwood , who , with a Master Glidden some hundred scars before , had had the barbed inspiration and invented the wire . The three-story brick mansion , like all palatial monstrosities , had devolved upon the public , becoming that least historical , most unthreatening of status quo structures , a museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with display cases of ' arly wire prototypes , barb-stamping machines , and legal documents .  | She crossed to the carriage stables , peeking in on their restored surreys , coaches , and horse-drawn sleighs . The side windows of the big house , dimly lit by gas burners , revealed the inner allure of a music room , a library , and a parlor full of foot-high porcelain Limoges figures . Lily did not stop for any of these seductions . Her goal lay at the back of the property , on the outer edge of the now bare woods . Tucked away in the shadow of the estate was the first of two houses that Elwood had built his daughter . The second , a honeymoon mansion , stood downtown , now the lodge for one of those Animal Clubs where men get together to wear funny hats and tell dirty jokes over dinner . This first house , still on father 's property , had been built for the girl when she was only a child . Everything about it  --  doors , windows , alcoves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doll 's palace was lit , as Lily knew it would be ; whoever took care of the property could not resist the look of a little house lit against the late-autumn woods . Night after night , the caretaker damned the expense and set the tableau . Lily kept out of the pool of light the little windows cast . Working her way behind the tiny two-decker , she lifted the back-door latch and crawled in . She barely fit in the diminutive rooms with their half-sized furniture . She sat down , monstrously filling the downstairs , crowding up against a table set for tea . She took up one hemi-demitasse , then tipped it over to see where it had been made . She had come to the only bearable place in town to think in secret . Now she found that she could think , and devastatingly clearly , but not about the topic she had come here to work out . Lily had come to the dollhouse to devise a plan , a course of action for helping her father . Now , filling three rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the one most in need of healing . She had left open the door of the tiny house . Its frame cut a rectangular gash into the pitch-black woods . She looked into the shortened frame and , unable to slow her thoughts down , she began to spook herself . She felt the half-sized door would suddenly fill with ; i hideous , escaped night figure whispering , " I am here , and so are you . " Quickly , she filled her mind with her family 's birthdays , the color and make of the family car , the titles of popular tunes . She forced her eyes away from the door , now less afraid of a night visitor than of the frame  | opening onto nothing at all . " All daughters , " she said out loud to the half-scale tea party , " come to the same end . " Calming a little , she laughed at her frayed nerves . She hiked her skirt to the cold November Might , and tried to remember the agenda . After long silence , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . "  |  | Rachel , at her traditional Saturday morning crack of dawn , prepared breakfast while the others slept . Despite the events of Ilic evening before , she remained vintage Rach , setting the breakfast table in grand George III style , mirroring both that monarch 's opulence and I l k senile dementia . Widened by two leaves , the family Formica looked the algorithm of elegance . She covered it with heavy linen and six full settings of the best bone china , a wedding present that had n't been out of the hutch for thirty years . Six plates , platelets , saucers , cups , and bowls : layout for a wedding or a wake . She flanked each place with a contingent of mint silver which she chose for its baroque complexity , compiling an anthology so varied and . iicane that the typical Hobson  --  raised on simple cutter , holder , and digger  --  could only guess at their functions and hope to make it through the meal by sticking to the standard rule of working from the outside in. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and embroidered trim , propping them up like boat prows at each place head . She filled six massive brandy snifters with incandescent orange juice . And in the center of each place setting , alone on the pristine bone china , sat the punchline to this expanse of porcelain and filigree : a showcased , military , red multivitamin . A long setup for a short gag . But she delivered that elaborate parody deadpan . Rachel 's world view  --  although she would have called it that only in farce  --  was simple . As long as she was condemned to a culture that mandated magnets on the refrigerator , she would be a blessed saint *  | She sang the praise of science , those white-coated fellows who tamed Premenstrual Syndrome by turning it into an acronym and rendered roughage a topic of polite party conversation . She wondered out loud in Laundromats how Granny ever ran her drier without anticling squares , and , getting no response from startled strangers , would add , " The static buildup back then must have been lethal . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the ludicrous was love it . In short , Rachel , stuck in an America trapped between William Cullen and Anita Bryant , between the twin possibilities of Dr. and Jimmy Doolittle , got along by out-outraging outrage . She never laughed at her own ironies , never gave away how much of the routine was earnest and how much joke . So long as the status approximated the quo , she knew that the only way to live in what was fast becoming a global pillage was to take cover and defer to the damage the other guy was doing to the place . She talked daily to her consumer products , believing that if she kept as much faith as a mustard seed in the dialogue , one day the mustard would , as advertised , say something back . She styled herself as her older sister 's corrective . She shared none of Lily 's nostalgia for the lost-encounter culture , none of what she called the woman 's sense of tragic relief . Rach , in her slot , had followed Lily , putting in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two semesters , exclaiming in mock horror , " They want you to know things when you get out of there . " She spoke of higher education in the tones reserved for the seven warning signals of cancer . For a year after dropping out , she wore a homemade button that read : THIS MIND INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK . Despite her goofball truancy , Dad had not disowned her , as he had threatened to do if any of the kids did n't finish college . She never gave him the opportunity . Reviving a grade-school propensity for figures , site scored higher on the actuarial exams than most CPAs and was swept up by a megalithic , conglomerate numerics firm secretly run by the Trilateral Commission . Plunked down in a lake-front skyscraper iii Chicago , she dealt all day in the mathematics of futures . She calculated to eight significant digits how likely an individual was to die over a given period of years . She never thought to apply the secret formula to het father . Neither father nor employers approved of her method  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could fault  | her , because the numbers kept coming out quickly and correctly . While she did not deal in scholarly math so much as in brute arithmetic , Rachel nevertheless met Dad 's long harped-on insistence that the kids somehow promote the world 's knowledge . She had a knack for sliding past Dad 's morass . She got along famously with the man , far better than any of the other kids . He cut her no favors , but she evaded his caustic fire . She fought back with an artless " Quit being stupit , " or " Hey , you 're hurting me . " Her secret was that she was not her parts . Dad could no more fluster her than could hunger or distress . The first she distanced with " My stomach is ravenous , " the second with " My mind just felt something awful . " She was just along for the ride . Rach got along with everybody who was n't certifiable and three quarters of those who were . She had as hilarious a time at the Farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone of the kids did not look on I ) c Kalb as the gulag : " Sure , it 's a little behind the times . But so 's Colonial Williamsburg , and people pay big bucks to visit there . " Nevertheless , she teased her folks , saying she would not do the hour drive out through the corn belt any more than she had to : " You guys are great fun , but after six or so round trips a year , the actuarial odds of being taken out of commission on the East-West Tollway by some boozer in a Mazda become absolutely unacceptable . " She had driven out this weekend partly because of Eddie Jr . ' s vigliteenth birthday and partly to try to weasel Eddie Sr. out of his newest decline . She had a third motive , kept secret . She thought , everyone else Ie  --  il Ig in and the holidays just a couple of months off , that she might coax the nuclear family into a few renditions of " The First Noel . " Not even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ury incarnations of midwinter  --  magnet figures infiltrating the manger *  | Eddie sat down and amused himself by chasing the little red pill around on his plate with his knife . Rachel maneuvered in front of him and yanked his face up by the chin . She narrowed her eyes and clenched her teeth until her head shook with full-scale muscle tremors . She hissed , " Do n't you ever , ever , ever , ever . . . " repeating the word with increasing savagery until Eddie at last backed down and laughed . She dusted her hands of him with one more wrist-arabesque , and went back to cracking eggs into a saucepan . " So what 's for break , " Eddie asked . " Fast ? " Rachel jabbed her kitchen knife toward his posh table setting , indicating juice and vitamin . " What you see is what you get . " Eddie resumed batting the tiny thiamine puck around his plate , knocking off delinquently when their mother came into the room . Ailene Hobson , nee Kobceck , was dressed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have passed for a housecoat . She went to the stove and autonomically flicked on a gas halo . But Rach anticipated her . " Cafe , madame ? " Mom took the proffered mug , surprised . " When did you learn how to make coffee ? " " Learn ? What I know about Java could fit on Juan Valdez 's green card . " Her mother mumbled thanks and drifted aimlessly around the room . Coffee thus ready at hand , Ailene 's entire morning ritual dissolved . Dazed by her efficient daughter , Ailene lit a cigarette in the superfluous gas flame and left the flame burning for reassurance . Rachel had already been out to the store and back , snagging the breakfast groceries , now spread all over the counter . Seeing them , Ailene went to her purse , perpetually wedged between the refrigerator and a cutting board , and fished out a ten-dollar bill that she tried to give to her daughter . " Here , " she said . " To help defray the cost . " Rachel took the bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her nostril . Her mother grabbed the money back , tsking loci disgust . " Ish , " she said . " You do n't know where that 's been . " " I can well imagine , " Rach said . Rejected but not rebuffed , Ailene tried to give the money randomly io the nearest alternate child . But Eddie Jr . declared that he would hold out for a twenty or nothing at all . Mother stuffed the note back into her put.sc.  | ammunition for a later date . She idled for a moment , then began tearing the price labels off the newly purchased breakfast goods . " What are you doing ? " asked Rachel . Ailene fluttered her hands . " I 'm just removing the little ... " " Why ? " Rachel demanded . Getting no answer , Rachel steered her mother by the shoulders , coffee mug in hand , to the place next to Eddie Jr . Ailene put on her facetious face of good behavior , sitting obediently as if she , after all the years of dishing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mom was an enigma to Eddie Jr. , the force that kept the house together through a miscellany of arcane formulas such as , " One out , one iii and one on . " He had gone from the adoration of childhood to the Polite bafflement of late teens without feeling the seam . But this morning Ile understood her nervous habits implicitly . " So how 's Pop ? " he asked , recommencing vitamin field hockey after the brief delay of game . He failed to ask the point blankly enough , and she looked up , brightening . " Except for his annual fall bronchitis , fine . " She had served too long as press secretary to unlock herself now , even to the man 's son . " I Ie got up at about three this morning and went into the study . More dictation , I assume . " Although Dad looked like a big-bellied Bob Hope with hair and without the nose , little Eddie could not help imagining him with Mussolini 's chin whenever the topic touched upon the man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least , they got the trains to rein on time . Artie shuffled in silently , sliding into an empty place . He took in Reich 's rococo prank and smiled weakly . Then he plunked his vitamin into the juice glass , swirling the concoction vigorously . Only when he was sure the pill had dissolved did he sip the mixture . For the ten or so days following his first hearing that Dad had once more taken ill , Artie invariably found he could not swallow anything more substantial than ( Teamed corn . lilene , still searching for something to do , upbraided him . " Arthur , ( ii look like you slept in those clothes . " " Well , Mon ' , there 's a good reason for that . Left my jammies in ( .1iitown. "  | " And go put something on your feet . " " What do you mean and , ' Mom ? And no , Mom . I do n't want to just yet . " You 'll catch cold , " insisted Ailene . " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer between me and viruses ? Why do the little suckers always go for the feet ? " " Because that 's all the farther they can reach , " explained Eddie . " The floor-dwelling viruses anyway . Now the wall kind can bail onto just about anyplace on your body . They ambush you from above . Then there 's the tree dwellers . They can only attach to wet hair . " Mom was an easy substitute , especially when the boys ganged up . Artie silenced his brother by presenting him with a spiral-bound book of multiple-choice questions , a preparation aid for yet another in an endless queue of exams that he had been taking , as he often put it , " since kingdom kong . " He sincerely and , he knew , naively believed that if he could just get over the next battery of tests , the next hurdle , he 'd be in the clear . Eddie , also a seasoned veteran , made the obligatory round of Legal jokes about how Rachel was making torts for breakfast and began quizzing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the review . He asked , " What 's up with Lil ? " addressing the question to the cabinets under the sink . " She 's . . . " Eddie Jr . replied , searching his memory for " asleep in the Deep " but forcing the ancient quantity into deeper and deeper hiding . He settled instead for , " She 's still in the rack . " Artie challenged his mother . " Pop was up and working when you went upstairs ? And he stayed in one piece all night ? No relapse ? " Ailene simultaneously shook her head and nodded , master of the self contradicting signal . " No vomiting ? " Ailene made another no , gravely . " How about temperature ? Not febrile ? " On Mom 's third denial , Artie said , " I just do n't get it . He 's got more severe symptoms than ever and he 's coming out of them faster than ever . " By way of explanation , Mom crumpled . The brave-soldier shoulders came forward and her voice collapsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her throat constricted as if she needed to spit . " He 'll talk to you , Artie . You can trap him . " Artie made a sound like a stifled hiccup . The kids had been all over this the night before , and tacitly for many nights before that . Moen knew all  | the arguments , and each kid knew that she knew that they knew . The stink of mutual knowledge filled the kitchen , as fat and acrid as Rachel 's bacon grease . No one said a word . At last , the silence flushed her out . " Or why do n't you go see a physician when you go back to Chicago , and tell him about your father , and see what he thinks ? " Her voice returned to normal . Her suggestion might at first glance have passed for a realistic compromise . Artie answered jocosely , more for his brother and sister than for Ailene . " Sure , Mom . Doc , it 's like this . There 's this guy . Well , actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's having these hallucinations , only he does n't want to come talk to you himself , because he 's afraid you might think he 's bonkers . ' They 'd put me away . I do n't need Bellevue , Ma ; I 've already got University of Chicago Law . " Eddie Jr. , positioned to see down the kitchen runway , cut off his mother 's reply by announcing , " Yo ! Here comes the man of the hour . " And there was Dad , as little as life , trapped in his swollen body , framed iii the doorway . " I 've just had the most marvelous idea , " he said on cue , in showman 's voice . " You guys are always egging me on to make a buck , ragging me about living up to my earning power . " None of them had ever once mentioned money to the man . " How 's this : I 'm going to put up a booth just to the side of all the other toll booths out on the East-West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll corner the market . The merican entrepreneurial tradition . As an initial promotion , I 'll even give out discount coupons for the return trip . " A grand entrance ; Dad again in peak form . It was once more Impossible for any of them to insist on the facts . Artie snorted . Eddie Jr . to wed with his place setting and managed a deferential grin . Rachel shook Ii eggy spatula at him , and Mom morosely kissed him good morning . In the morning light , Pop looked as hearty and hale as in the fussily-scrapbook photos . Artie recalled a page of three snapshots : a wimmuer ; a wrestler in attack crouch ; and a cocky , slender man in 1 m m i loran . They were from when Dad was just Artie 's age  --  a beautiful , vity-defying gymnast , a scrapper . And seeing Dad 's clean factual 1 1 ( 1 k , his full departure from the past , Artie felt his intestines contract as h sailed over a crest that dropped off sharply . Itit ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My work  | goes on trippingly , if anyone cares . I 've finally busted out of a bottleneck that 's been holding up the show for years . At last I have an angle on how to bring the thing I know best into the modern world . Without offending the authorities , that is . " He looked around magisterially  --  quizmaster , king of the heap until someone said otherwise . He took his chair at what he managed to make look like the head of the round table and breathed in deeply . " I knew that taking the . . . " His malicious eyes belied a sheepish mouth . " The early retirement was a great idea . " As even the most Pollyannaish among them now admitted , the latest " retirement " had been forced on Dad some months back when he passed into near coma in front of a class of high school American history students . Again the kitchen filled with the stale air of mutual knowledge . " Get a load of this guy , " Rachel said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take this . Lemme out of here . " " What 's all this , then ? " Dad asked , indicating the sumptuous table setting . At last Ailene noticed what her child had done with her mint-condition treasures . She screamed softly , as if bitten . She leapt to her feet and grabbed two bowls to return them to the hutch before she realized the deed was done and sat down again , sadly . Had Dad come downstairs obviously ill , Artie , as oldest son , might have beseeched the rest : We can stop this guy , stand up to his retirement jokes , force him to face facts . But with Pop the picture of health , their combined strength counted for nothing . Had Artie appealed to solidarity now , he knew what the others would say : That Artie . Always exaggerating . Why fight the man when he is feeling so good ? Their own perpetual hope prevented action . The man routed them into themselves . Reduced to one on one , Rachel was the only person who stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaws and stuck the penultimate vitamin in , sending OJ in after it . Then she slammed his mouth shut and kissed him . " Would you care to see our dessert menu ? " Unflustered , Pop primped his place setting until it met his satisfaction . With a few deft origami folds , he transformed his linen table napkin into the protruding cups of a brassiere , which he promptly held up to his chest to the delight of Eddie Jr . and the cultivated indifference of everyone else . When Rachel began to sling her carefully prepared slop , a much-guarded recipe midway between scrambled eggs and hash browns , he called out ,  | " Hey ! Wait a minute . We 're not going to start eating without numbertwo child present , are we ? Count off . " And he made the closest sound to a whistle that his partial plate allowed . From some distant recess of the house Lily 's disembodied voice called , " Start already . Leave me be . " Hostile enough in tone , Lily 's outburst , chiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad 's lips . " You heard the woman , " he said . Each Hobson started in as instructed , without any face giving away its private reasons . Artie , eggs in hand , ate along with the rest , trying unsuccessfully to remember the source of the old adage he had read somewhere , confirmed so clearly in this silent , common consensus , that each of us is truly alone . As he had done for every family meal over the last twenty years , Eddie Sr. put forward something for the tribe to consider while digesting . These instructional sessions had grown more intense over the years and seemed to peak whenever he was between jobs . " So what 's the topic for this morning 's meal ? " he asked , simulating democracy . Artie suggested , " How about multiple choice Q and A about corporate litigation ? " Dad overruled him , as expected . Suppressing that outburst , Dad began , " I 've been doing a little reading on a puzzle called The Prisoner 's Dilemma . The modern form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corporation , 1951 , a year wedged between a couple of dates that ought to go off like bells in your brains . But we wo n't examine the historical milieu just yet . " He nibbled on a bacon end , pretending to take food . " Here 's the gist of the problem , in my personal version . Two men are summoned into Joe McCarthy 's office ... " Rachel groaned . " Not this again . We 've done witch hunts . " They had all heard Pop speak many times of his bout with collective policing , his minor brush with martyrdom in front of committee years before . " No , no . You misunderstand . The questioner is not the villain in this one . We can make it anything . Let 's make it two countries exchangiii4 . . . " Make it two men and McCarthy , and get it over with , " Rachel said . Two guys are up in Senator Smoking Joe McCarthy 's office , sometime Hi the early I 950s . The gentlemen arc both prominent public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' ellas , we know that you are both Reds . I 've got plenty  | of evidence for an indictment , but not enough to guarantee the conviction you deserve . Let 's make a deal . If either of you comes forward with the dope on the other , the man who talks will go free and the other will fry . If neither of you spills the goods on the other , you 'll still suffer public humiliation at the very least . ' " " What happens if they both squeal ? " Eddie Jr . interrupted , drawn into the game despite the situation . " Good question , number-two son . That 's important . If they both rat on each other , their double crosses partly invalidate the other 's testimony . But they still lose more than they would compared to shared silence . Let 's say mutual incriminations will hurt them more than if they both say nothing , but that in undercutting each other , they prevent the unopposed squealer from leading them to electrocution . " Dad looked frustrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me draw it for you . " He jumped up from the table and looted a pen from Ailene 's purse . Ripping off a sheet of paper towel , he drew a few quick lines , adding some all-caps block printing . Dad never wrote in cursive or lowercase . " As you can see , I 've been brushing up on the numbers racket . " He dropped the finished product in the center of the table : HIM KEEP QUIET SQUEAL KEEP I GET 2 YEARS I GET CHAIR QUIET HE GETS 2 YRS HE GOES FREE I GO FREE I GET 10 YEARS HE GETS CHAIR HE GETS 10 YRS Artie reached for the sheet , looking it over cursorily . " I can see what 's coming , " he said . " It 's amazing what law school can salvage from undergraduate liberalarts training , " Pop noted . ME SQUEAL  | Ailene put down her fork but declined the sheet when Artie offered it to her . " I for one do n't see where there 's any paradox . It 's obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neither of them will end up in bigger trouble . The two men simply have to trust each other , not be intimidated , and realize that they 're in the same boat and would end up worse off if they start naming names . " " That 's exactly what they do realize , for about two seconds . They 're in the same boat , as the lady says . They make eye contact , and it occurs to them both that as long as they hang together they ca n't hang separately . Then the senator puts them into separate rooms , going back and forth between them and asking , Well , how about it now ? ' No rubber hoses , you understand . This is America ; it 's all done with logic . " Rach grabbed the paper from Artie 's grip . She looked it over quickly and spun it in little Eddie 's direction . Hearing the man weave his special breed of silence , Lily came quietly out of her room and sat herself in the last empty place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of her as she sipped orange juice , grimacing . Dad , with expert timing , let them each have a look before going on . " Then each guy starts to reason , The other guy can do one of two things . Suppose the other guy says nothing . Then I can save myself two years , two good years of my life , by talking , getting off free rather than being publicly humiliated . On the other hand , what if he talks ? Then if I stay silent , I go to the chair . But I can preempt my opponent by delivering the goods first . Ten years , while stiff , still beats high voltage . Whether the other guy talks or not , I can improve my payoff by talking . ' " " And since they both reason that way , " Artie said , as if co-inventor , they end up with five times the jail term . " A dry silence followed . " I 've got it , " interjected Rachel , rising to her fact and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Joe , if you do this to us , we 'll tell everybody about what you do with that Errol Flynn . ' " Ignoring big sister 's routine outburst , Eddie Jr . handled the summing tip . " So the point is , when reasoning separately , they drag themselves down . But what about reasoning from above ? " " Good man . I like that . Reasoning from above . " Dad sat triumphantly at table , gratified by the response from his brood . " But how can they get tht rc ? What does it mean ? " ilcne ignored his question , even more distressingly hypothetical than  | the original problem . " Never mind above . They 're both in it . They both know what they need to do . " " But they ca n't be sure the other can be trusted , " Lily added , catching up to where she could doublethink the old man . Ailene was now near tears over the apparently abstract problem . " Where 's the flaw , then ? Which way should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no flaw , dear . And there is no should in reasoning . There 's only practical outcome . " " And so , folks , " said Rachel , voice-over style . " Yer dandruff you do and dandruff you do n't . " " Now for some variations , " Dad persisted . " Airplane hijacking with hostages . Price wars at the fuel pump . Food hoarding . Bank runs . Industrial poisoning . Amatory jealousy . Divorce proceedings , for that matter . The arms race . Double-parking . Anyone want to take a stab at how they 're all related ? " An average breakfast-table question , at home , Saturday morning with the Hobsons . Just then Artie , who had gotten the now dog-eared paper towel back and was juggling the numbers for any mathematical escape trick he might have overlooked , flashed onto a little reasoning from above of his own . He thought : Good Christ . Ten minutes ago the topic was how to save the man 's life . Now it 's game theory . Artie held the epiphany in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's miniature classroom was a prisoner 's matrix all its own . Dad diverted them from addressing the real catastrophe by drawing them into this game of defection and cooperation . They had to play his dilemma if he was to play theirs . Pop trapped each Hobson in an inverted payoff matrix where the promise of a phantom premium , the threat of being left holding the bag , drove each to be the first to defect and the last to come clean . Artie saw the circling antagonists caught in the need to cut a deal but not knowing how to reach it . Dad himself had become this contest between " he " and " I , " an agile , evasive mind trying to outdance the slow process of his disease , whatever it was . And the island of mutual collaboration that logic and good judgment kept unattainable , the ability to step out from the unassuming and familiar breakfast nook of the last family in these parts choosing to eat at home , left Artie powerless to defy reason , set aside decorum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are patently and dangerously ill . You 've spent the last few days with something haywire in your cells . You 've killed the last  | several years nursing an antisocial obsession . You 've lived the last few decades chased by God knows what . And you must now , against your will and for the greater good , pack yourself off to whatever sanatorium will take you , to purge the symptoms for one weekend at least , to do what all our combined anguish can not do for you . " Before Artie had power to say behold ; Pop 's breakfast-table robustness made it seem that perhaps his dizzies were , after all , only a persistent virus . Artie watched the man conduct his class and thought that maybe the family should consider itself lucky that Pop felt better than last night . The big stink , the showdown , could wait , in any case , until the family was not all together , steeped in a harmless word game where reasoning from above was so much more difficult than the harmless and more acceptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations . And reasoning this way , Artie walked away from resolution . The next minute , Dad , sensing that the magic web was weakening , the entangling dilemma in danger of being outflanked , held up a ringmaster 's hand and in familiar carnival huckster 's voice announced , " Friends , for your listening alarm and delight . . . " He sprang from his seat and fiddled with the ancient tube receiver that kept court on the top of the refrigerator . The radio looked to have been last tuned in for the Bay of Pigs flash . Dad tweaked a variable capacitor and the device squealed the ethereal , high-frequency audio-graffiti that is second language to anyone horn in this century . Ghostly tracers of disembodied banshee bands blared out along the dial , asserted themselves temporarily on center stage , grew garbled , then died off just as suddenly in the shift of frequencies . At last , in a recess of the radio band where citizens ordinarily never ventured , the man found what he looked for . As if nothing had changed since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dulcet Rudy Vallee , CVL ( Certified Vagabond Lover ) , amplitude modulated but still unbowed , filled up the breakfast room too brightly for this hour of the second week of Daylight Savings Time , releasing the prisoners hom their McCarthian matrix with a nifty number from Dr. Vallee 's Musical Hospital : " Spread a little music wherever you go , and nothing can ever go wrong , " replete with Helen Kane 's boop-boop-de-doop . The family issued a collective groan . Lily stood , whined a muffled " I ( ite you , " and stamped out , punctuating her exit with an offstage slam of I ) edroonc door . Eddie Sr. threw his hands out to the side in a mock  | objection . " What did I do ? What 's wrong with a little old-time religion ? " But they were not panning Rudy , criminally optimistic as he was . It was Eddie the others howled down , Eddie and his thirty-year claim to the psychical ability , which he himself never attempted to explain , to sense , anywhere and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular tune from the years between 1939 and 1946 . The kids had , on a few occasions , gone to great efforts to set up controlled experiments to disprove the talent , to show it up as a hoax . But to date , Dad had repeatedly stymied the positivist strain that he himself attempted to nurture in them . Eddie Jr . had , the year before , even tried to persuade the old man to be his high school science-fair project , claiming it would get him into Carbondale at least , if not Stockholm . Dubbed by Rachel the Glenn Miller Tiller , Dad 's gift was incontrovertible . Every time he turned the radio on it would be Harry James or Benny Goodman or Les Brown and His Band of Renown . Worse , Pop never dropped in on the middle of a tune but always on the very opening bars . Sometimes , for a special splash , he fiddled with the dial before turning the set on , and then he 'd land right on the target with a Midway Island precision . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the big guy had intended : the school session immediately ended , the students heading off to whatever private work called them , while the invalid instructor slipped out of the conversation 's back door without further interrogation . Rach attended to dishes , puffing on her pitch pipe , Toy of the Week . Mom went upstairs . No further sound issued from Lily 's room . Eddie Jr . pushed back his chair , strode for the runway , and put his shoulder into Artie 's gut in simulated slow motion , saying " Pigskin " as he spun off-tackle and fly-patterned for the front door . " In a minute , " said Artie , clamping down on his escaping father 's shoulder . " Just a second , sir . There 's something we 've got to talk about . " Dad interrupted him with the same hand wave of voila he 'd used to introduce his radio act . " I think I can anticipate what you are about to say , " he said , pulling back the sleeve of his cotton T-shirt as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of anyone 's armpit whose flesh had n't dropped off the limbs and slid into the belly was a round , cherry ring . Too surprised to do anything else , Artie reached forward and touched the spot gingerly .  | " Did you know that that old children 's game about pockets of posies and ashes was really a medieval invocation to ward off infection ? Seems the rings and the rosies were , in historical fact , buboes . " Artie could only stare at the sore , a gap of many centuries separating him from the man who had raised it . Choosing between the bad taste of going forward and the impossibility of going back , Dad pressed the issue , explaining , " Plague , you see . All fall down . "  |  | Sometime during those last few weeks , my father and I watched the late show together . We used to do that two or three times a year whenever I was home . Movies let us sit in the same room without having to talk about anything . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair next to him , and we 'd turn the set down low in the dark so as not to keep anyone else up . Our last late show together was a completely expendable forties musical called Orchestra Wives . I 've since looked the film up , reading that it starred George Montgomery , Ann Rutherford , Cesar Romero , and the Nicholas Brothers , among others . My father named the performers , lying on the couch announcing the cast as they made their black-and-white entrances and exits in the dark . But the names meant nothing to me , and , along with the film 's plot , I instantly forgot them . As far as I remember , the story concerns the wives of a big band 's members being bitchy to Ms. Rutherford , the newest swing-time bride . " Themselves neglected , they apply group cruelty to the woman my dad called " Andy Hardy 's eternal Polly . " In the end , as mandated by the motion-picture code , everyone learns the value of compassion . Just how the healing fiction works its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly forgettable in all respects except one . Its music was the finest of the era . The story was an excuse to get Glenn Miller 's orchestra in front of a camera for the second and last time . Not long after , Miller was shot down in the English Channel without a tiller . But behind the silly escapist plot and despite real life 's less than compassionate ending , Miller and men are there , preserved on film , making that great sound with those freewheeling , dangerously abundant reeds and brasses . Although I failed to understand at the time , my father lay in the dark , involved in the stupid vehicle , evidently moved . Of course , he saw all sorts  | of phantoms in the thing that I could not . He said he 'd been sixteen when he first saw the show , a confession I discounted , as I was the eternal sixteen-year-old to his perpetual forty-seven . When a tune began he would arch his eyebrows and sing along , neither ironic nor nostalgic but absolutely deadpan archival , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or " I 've Got a Gal in Kalamazoo . " As with 9944/ioo percent of American films made during wartime , the movie 's hidden message was a simple , contemporary variant of the advice given dutiful newly married Victorian women : " Close your eyes and think of England . " Hollywood 's meal ticket : give the forbidden appetite fantastic , rebellious slack . Then draw it back , fifth reel , into sacrifice and the public good . I 'm not sure how it happens . In times of crisis something clicks , and suddenly vested self-interests vanish . Or at least that 's the myth of the wartime feature , one that 's always been good box office . I guess at all this : I have never lived through a popular war effort , except via the late show . But every morale film I 've ever seen has a curious way of giving and taking away simultaneously . Like Betty Grable on the lockers of GIs : nothing satisfies like the unavailable . I hear my father sing : " Get a load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea lanes free . " I see him at sixteen : after two hours in the matinee , returning to daylight in a world where the apocalyptic battle , untouchable , remote , and final , required that everyone play team ball . A world where women sacrificed stockings with delicious pleasure ; men , gasoline . Nodding off in the dark , I pretended Dad 's interest in the film was only clinical . He had a weakness for the dated artifact : the Shirley Temple single , the Mademoiselle issue of March 1942 ? " What 's New ? " I filed the film away with those . Besides , I never sat where I could see his face . We watched the story , groaned , and then sat through the news . We groaned again at the headlines , and then we said good-night . Much later I was shocked to discover how much my father , the archrationalist , loved this movie . Most old movies for that matter , escapist time-wasters included . I never once saw him go to the theater . But at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deferentially , " Want to see what 's on ? " I should have been tipped off by his knowing all the lines and each of the actors ' names . But I did n't catch on until too late . Astonishingly , the professional educator , friendless , intent on discovering what was really going on , still  | loved the fables of moral fallen women and criminal moguls with hearts of gold . He fell victim to the cheapest narrative tricks . Until the end , he was a secret fan of the possibility of another place , the other person 's story . I always thought that intellect and sentiment formed the horns of an exclusive either-or . They do not . My father had them both in doses that he , as well as the rest of us , paid for healthily . My father at sixteen , too old to be precocious any longer , spent 1942 pent up in the Palisades , attending high school and moonlighting as a singing waiter at a **26;177;TOOLONG moored on the Hudson . I picture him reading a newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of the Bataan Death March , understanding , in theory , that the old world was dead . Not that apocalypse touched home . The nearest the war came in the first two years , he once confessed to me , was when the FBI picked up a half dozen German saboteurs that an enemy sub had dropped off on Fire Island . Between innings on weekend ball fields , he exchanged stories of how japs used GI skulls for shaving dishes or broke teeth and snapped off fingers for gold inlays and rings . I see the young man in his two-year holding pattern , pacing his cage , agonizingly delayed , frantically waiting to graduate , come of age , and contribute . For the world was entering its last unquestioned holy cause . The outcome was far from certain : the ball fields he lolled on might soon be run by Krauts . So he agonized , ached for eighteen . Even at his age , he did not delude himself that one more pimpled kid would tip the outcome . But more certain than the rightness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had not contributed would be beneath contempt . I 'm sure there was only a fine line between his laudable desire to help save Europe and his self-interest in securing the same official papers that gave his homely older brother free rein with what were then referred to , without irony or infringement , as dames . My grandparents , to his shame , would not let Pop enlist illegally . And no one could do preparatory sit-ups all day long . So he was forced to get through each day by killing time , which in northern Jersey required a substantial amount of social diversion . One afternoon between school and waiting on tables , he caught a matinee of Orchestra Wives and was duly impressed by the film , if not by it , s philosophical underpinning . I am sure that even that first time , the dramatic tension of Orchestra Wives took second place to the glorious Big  | Band chords . He adored the music from the opening bars and immediately incorporated " I 've Got a Gal in Kalamazoo " into the showboat 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tennis rackets as if they were ukes . The movie , coupled with Holiday Inn , Babes on Broadway , Yankee Doodle Dandy , and the other big-budget escapist enterprises Dad went to see that year , more than Doolittle 's Tokyo raid or the battle of the Coral Sea , affected who he became , and , by relation , me . The universal point of all these tales was that the best a fellow could do to fight the terrible vicissitudes of the Big Picture was to stay home and mind the local store . In particular , a man could move the world if he were happily married . And the trick to a happy marriage was to do one 's homework beforehand , before one 's condition had been permanently altared . So Dad , at sixteen , found an outlet for the frustrated energy stirred up in him by the world 's burning . Years later , he elaborated for us at dinner his deadly earnest decision to do the legwork and locate the perfect girl . Too much was at stake in the early forties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since Kalamazoo was a shade too far for overnighters , Dad limited his first research forays for the ideal spouse to the greater New York metropolitan area . He concentrated around north suburban Jersey , fertile ground . Somewhere in the tens of thousands of girls his age , he felt sure to find one who combined the best parts of city girl and ingenuous hick , o woman both debutante and bespectacled wallflower  --  brilliant , bookish , industrious , but who could sing with a swing . All things abundant , but in moderation . Yet to my father , all things in moderation always included moderation itself . It was not sufficient for his mate-to-be merely to maintain the loan Leslie look while avoiding a criminal record . His woman had to shine . At sixteen , held to the sidelines in the hour of greatest urgency , he devised criteria severe enough to screen Supreme Court nominees . Starting the search at sixteen , he figured he 'd have plenty of time to do it right . In Pop 's mind , marriage , like birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once in a lifetime . The first gal who looked good enough on paper , accumulating a sterling GPA , amassing the obligatory public-service points , and even garnerinjg , at the tender age of fifteen , the distinction of Passaic Meat Packers ' Union junior Princess , fell from the running when I ) ad discovered that her crazy  | Creek father lived only for his obsessive dream of stealing the Elgin Marbles back from the British Museum . A second beauty , so his story usually went , took the disqualifying demerit because of a harmless pathology that drove her , every time she got a hundred yards away from her house , back to the front door to check if she 'd locked it . As Dad told us , he calculated how many minutes of their life would be lost to this habit over , rtv years , and quietly shook her hand good-bye . By this time in the recitation , Dad would always have us in hysterics . To finish us off , he 'd Wind up with the tale of still another young lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything there was to know about matrix manipulation and made a dynamite peach melba to boot , she thought that Cervantes was a Mexican mariachi band . Despite his later facetious retelling , the boy he 'd been was really out here , digging . The old guy in embryo , the child 's research grew increasn/ , ' l v rigorous and took him farther and farther afield . Passaic , Paterson , nd beyond : still nothing panned out . Saturday nights he tried the me-tested , dance-marathon , trial-by-erotica method , but always came way empty . Pop grew older , more sophisticated in the art of the stakeout. tinting seventeen , he escalated his efforts . Dad became adept at sifting 1n/ormation  --  the Library Municipal Room , City Hall , even the publicKhoo/ system 's records . Somewhere his wife waited for him to discover her . Ile had to check everywhere . As time passed and his less fastidious classmates pinned and unpinned , engaged and disengaged themselves many times over , my old man began 1o , suspect that he was a victim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dark night of doubt : maybe there simply were n't any girls of marriageable age that could meet selection standards as stringent as his . But once having started out on the path of talent scouting , he doomed himself to sticking to it . For if he settled now for second best , he could never hope to respect , for life , a woman whom he deliberately avoided measuring against surrendered standards . In his entrapment by perfectionism , he never changed . Why a lower-middle-class teenager could n't content himself with the sample cycle of dating and mating , of love  --  marriage  --  baby-carriage , that satisfied everybody else is as much a mystery to me as it was to him . ( : rented my grandfather , a hard-drinking latter-day economic immigrant u ho managed to squeak in just before the country slammed its doors shut  | and sealed the Ellis Islands , had cultivated a modicum of Irish morality in the boy . But Dad 's father 's idea of a clean and ordered world required only that the boy maintain rulered sideburns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big wooden cuff-clamps . The fastidiousness that the old Irishman meant to instill in his progeny degraded in Dad , who thought it sufficient to hang his trousers upside down by their cuffs from dresser drawers , only to resurface cruelly in me , a man who singlehandedly subsidizes the dry-cleaning industry . In place of this shed **25;205;TOOLONG , Dad had a rage to order that his immigrant father , as well as his assimilated children , never quite understood . For even though he rose no higher than deplorable in father 's and son 's hierarchies of good grooming , Pop contracted a far more lethal strain of the efficiency disease . The search for the perfect spouse was one symptom . He was infected with the need to squeeze the full , appropriate use from every item in his life . The need helped kill him . He told us where he had first been exposed to the virus . He 'd caught it three years before Orchestra Wives , the year his voice changed , 1939 , out in Flushing Meadow at the New York World 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Progress disease , and Pop contracted it at once . Several visits to the Fair , an unprecedented celebration of technological progress and utility built around the theme of " Building the World of Tomorrow , " changed the boy profoundly in a way that rippled down a causal chain and never stopped . The etiology was even more specific . Of the more than fifteen hundred exhibits , one in particular did him in . At thirteen , he did not understand the earth-moving events behind the premature closing of the Czech pavilion . In the amusements and side shows , he was already too sophisticated to have more than passing interest . He stopped at Westinghouse long enough to chat and share a cigarette with the robot Elektro . The time capsule fascinated him , but he did not then have the patience for the past that circumstance would later force on him . He would come back to the buried metal message later , dig it up from an all but lost printed map . But the pavilion that utterly floored him at the time , completely overhauled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Futurama . Three times that year he stood for hours on the sinuous entrance ramp ,  | waiting among a crowd of tens of thousands for his glimpse of the astonishing city of 1960 . He fidgeted through the preshow in the darkened auditorium , then climbed into his self-powered conveyor chair , leaned back beside the speaker , and listened to the recorded voice narrate a synchronized tour of the wonders opening up in front of him . He spun past the **31;232;TOOLONG model of futuristic landscapes , farms where plants grew under individual globes , power factories that doubled as recreation areas , impeccable suburbs , logical industrial parks , and , finally , the staggering city center itself , a vision beyond even the recorded narrator 's ability to describe . " Unbelievable ? " I can still hear him mimic the voice-over . " Remember , this is the world of 1960 . " Pop described how each time , at the end of the ride , he would stand up from his chair , still under the spell of the model , and leave the pavilion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the panorama 's final scene : a typical intersection of 1960 , a life-size implementation of the model , a large-as-fact creation of the miniature replica working out the simulated future he had just witnessed . That , he often explained , first fired his forming mind : the exhibit 's last prediction fleshed out in the full-scale world . I can feel the rush of arrival that passed through him each time he stepped into Futurama 's final chapter . This glimpse of perfection only twenty-one years off remade the teenager in its own image . Overnight , he grew obsessed with bringing this future world about . He made himself into a mobile sieve , extracting order from disorder , decreasing entropy by directing things to their proper place . He never stopped believing , as far as I know , that if he followed his own miniature exhibit through to the end , he would eventually come onto the last , life-size display , out in the open air . This Futurama-induced administrative competence stranded the boy in singing-waiterdom while the future of the real place was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred other outlets , ultimately driving him to Passaic for the spouse research on weekends , not to find the most desirable mate but the most appropriate . Dad probably should have been an engineer , the only line of work that lit his temperament . The job might have given him that illusion of slow improvement that could have saved him . He would have become one , too ,  | if it had n't been for the detour that history arranged for him . He wanted me to take up the work he never did , but on that hope I could not deliver . My product has to be another . Some months after Futurama closed , when he heard the news about the miracle at Dunkirk , Pop thrilled to it as only a suitor of progress could . He cheered not so much the escape itself light technology throwing mud in the Nazi 's eyes by evacuating a third of a million soldiers in fishing boats . He was electrified by the delicious sense of the episode being managed efficiently , meetly , and effectively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Roosevelt authorized on February 20 , 1942 , failed to give him the same sense of engineering perfection , it was because he never heard it happening . Like most wartime Americans aside from those imprisoned , the boy probably would have approved of the internment of a hundred thousand of his fellow citizens , Americans of Japanese Ancestry . Since he had never met any AJAs , Dad thought them as mythical as Assyrians coming down like wolves on the fold . At sixteen , the efficiency of our country 's reverse Dunkirk would probably have interested him more than the morality or defensibility of the matter . Had Dad heard of the mass imprisonment , coming from a matinee of Orchestra Wives , it might have seemed no more real than the pictures of Nazi concentration camps that year distributed to boys on bubble-gum cards , reading " Do n't let this happen here . " By the time we sat in the dark and watched that ludicrous film together a third of a century later , most of his issues had already been decided . Dad had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , light , or easy to give away . He had already planned the details of his own break , even as he called out the movie 's cast of players to me . I have long since forgotten what the film was all about . All I can recall now is sitting in that room , in front of the faint , gray glow of the tube , wondering where my father was escaping to . I was still sidetracked on second-guessing , in the progress of his health , the covert message he meant to send to himself , to us , to the runaway and untouchable world . I overlooked the principal point : I should have seen that whatever Dad thought his illness represented , he was really sick . He was going through an actual hell of tortured and poisoned cells . I should have addressed the illness first and not waited to discover what it stood for . It 's obvious , in retrospect , what I should have done . I should have gone  | over to the couch and issued a soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell me what 's the matter . " I ought to have made clear to him that it no longer mattered what happened then . I should have given my one , obvious reason why he should stick around , here , now , healed . Back in the present . But I had no idea of what the present was . All the headlines agreed that the old place was dead . But what at that moment struggled to replace it was anyone 's guess . I should have forced my father to return to the local urgencies of this place , this year . But I could not tell him how to find his way back to them . I had no more sense of ' 78 than he had had of ' 42 , on the rumor-filled ball fields at sixteen . I was not even sure the trade-off was fair . Thinking of that evening , I am filled with revisions . I allowed my father to lose me in the dominant tense . I looked at the man lying prostrate on the couch , jaundiced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding down the terminal gut-retch welling up in him . But all I could see was the boy of sixteen , the one he had told me of , involved in the enterprise of screening the files for his potential helpmate . I saw him attending school , perfecting his evening waiter 's act , memorizing Miller 's serenades , dabbling at lifting the long ball , wading through the whole mid-teen High Lutheran cycle of devotion , apostasy , and disgust , breezing through algebra on his way to an engineering career , alternately too serious and too irreverent for a boy his age , and , most of all , agonizingly waiting for his eighteenth birthday to enlist , but in the meantime daily wearing , even when it clashed with his civvies or his waiter 's duck-tail suit , a bright blue-and-white pin , obtained three years before at the General Motors Futurama exhibit highlighting the world of 1960 , that bore the inscription " I Have Seen the Future . "  |  | Eddie Jr . thought it the classic routine . Artie snapped him the pigskin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was , up Second Street . Eddie waved him downfield with the universally recognized quarterback 's hand motion for a big-play bomb : deep , deep , deeper . Then , when the sucker was incredibly , ridiculously deep , and it became obvious even to Artie that nobody in hell could possibly chuck a football that far , Eddie Jr . reversed his hand motion and waved big brother back in . Artie did all that he could do to save face in the situation : he grinned sheepishly , I 've been had . He yelled " Asshole " into the crisp , bowl-game air , scrambling to reverse his fly pattern as if wise to the joke from the beginning . " You talkin ' to me ? " little Eddie yelled , upfield . " I 'm an asshole ? What a terrible , terrible thing to call your baby brother . I may be an asshole , but at least I 'm not the one doing the scatter pattern . " This small blow was no retaliation for the dozen years of sadism that Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too nice a fellow to retaliate . Even his anger was benevolent . Nevertheless , the comeback gratified him , and for the next few passes , he took a little something off his return spirals , as apology . They lobbed the ball to one another with an earnest relaxation , as if this were not the big game but only the warm-up . Artie threw for precision  --  the ICBM guided all the way from Vladivostock to the neighborhood junior high school , landing after twenty thousand miles in the third aisle of the faculty parking lot . Eddie preferred the wild but flashy hot-dog pass  --  the flee-flicker , Statue of Liberty , double-reverse , play-action fake . His were heat-seekers , or TOWs , not the most reliable missiles in the world but undeniably novel technology . The brothers shuttled the ball back and forth in the expectant daylight , Artie for  | accuracy , Eddie imitating the dramatic vees of last month 's departing geese . They did not throw hard . The air was now cold enough , however , that even relaxing one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroics later , Eddie Jr . collapsed to earth , using the pigskin as a pillow . Artie , his yearly autumn anxiety once more welling up in him  --  you 're wasting time ; you 'll die in school as the world unfolds out here  --  lay next to his brother , uncushioned on the iron ground . " I think , " began Eddie , in confidential burlesque , " I know what 's wrong with your father . " Artie did not turn his head . " Great . But it 's your father we 're trying to diagnose , buddy . " " Know how he always sort of curls up when it comes on , cringes all of a sudden , like ? " Eddie 's speech , whenever he tried to sound serious , grew awkwardly casual , returning by reverse evolution to the embryonic speech of his grandmother , a rich , weird branch of Lower Manhattan , Southern European English . Her inflections slopped back out of the melting pot to claim him . He recalled her telling of how eighty years earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was now only a half hour out of downtown Hoboken . " Flinching , " Eddie continued , a victim of diction . " You 've seen it : like he 's bracing for something . And then  --  watch him next time . Always this upwards sweep of the eyes . " " I 've seen it , " said Artie , quietly . " So what are you suggesting ? The Henny Penny syndrome ? " " In a manner of speaking , my man . A la 1978 . Put it together , mofo . What 's on the news these days , almost every night ? " " Basketball scores ? " " Besides that , you overeducated nit . Scientists fire retros , wrestle to stabilize Skylab . Details at ten . ' " Artie tried to imagine Pop obsessed with the idea that an artificial moon , out-of-control , threatening to crash any month now , had his name on it . He imagined Dad , periodically tearing his family out from their established bunker and insisting they remain moving targets , latch growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , no matter how he wound his path across the map , would soon swoop down for the final interception . SPACECRAVI BITES MAN . Despite going a way s toward explaining Pop 's secondary symptoms , his brother 's ii ltcrl ) rctat 0 ) 11 was too far on the tabloid side , even for I ) ad.  | " Where 'd you get that idea , the supermarket check-out line ? I thought I told you to stop reading newspapers that carry alien-invasion stories as their main headlines . " He tried unsuccessfully to pull the football out lion , under his brother 's stout neck . " I la ! I suppose you want me to start reading that New York liberal rag of yours , now that I 've grown up ? How can you trust a paper that has n't covered sports adequately since sculling went out of fashion ? No way , palomino . And I think you ought to quit denying the obvious . Your dad 's bracing himself for falling space stations . " " Rut what about the high fever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objections did Artie realize their ridiculousness . He had once more been utterly duped . Things had gotten so far out of hand that he had fin gotten that his brother 's suggestion had been facetious . Dad had , after all , been dosing out since long before Sputnik . Eddie Jr . had tricked him into taking a second downfield hand wave seriously . Artie thought of how he used to run riot over the kid . Once he could have gotten him to believe anything . But something had turned for the worse between the two of them in the last few years . Artie confronted the awful possibility that under the stress of current events , he had somehow become the gullible one . Lddie enjoyed the advantage . " Yeah . You 're right . What about the vomiting ? I mean , if I were about to be hit with NASA 's finest , I 'd want it to be on a full stomach . " When his older brother did not reply , Eddie added , contritely and sadly , " Joke , Artie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed in his vacuum of sound , committing himself no further to little bro 's truce than the ambiguous gesture of pinching the bridge of his nose . He conceded that Edski was funny . The kid had a natural punchline , as with so much else . Even when pretending acerbity , Eddie was nicer and kinder than was safe . His little brother would swallow his phlegm sooner than offend anyone by spitting . But certain facts about the littlest I lobson had by now made themselves apparent to Artie . Artie felt that the kid , in coining of age , had reneged on an understanding , had lie ( o , ue a questionable quantity . One could not , for instance , send him to the store with a twenty-dollar bill and expect to retrieve full face value on the remaining change . Eddie would come back with coins of varying de non , in ; , tious sp , c , ul over his person and would spend weeks pulling  | singles out of hitherto undiscovered pockets , remarking in surprise , " Hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time Artie headed back to U. of C. Law to knock out another semester , he hoped that upon his next return his brother would at last demonstrate competence . But Eddie Jr . remained the same  --  cheerfully inept . Coupled with his proven unreliability , linked to it in a way that Artie could n't put his finger on , was Eddie 's alarming propensity for making friends , a practice the male Hobsons had scrupulously avoided for centuries . Soon it would be Thanksgiving , and through the startled house would pass sundry craigs and barbaras and kellys and bobs , each of whom Eddie would take pains to introduce to the family , optimistically beginning , " You all remember . . . " knowing full well that nobody did . Artie lay perfectly still , feeling each breath , staving off hypothermia through sheer will . He thought back to the last time he had felt any urge to bring an acquaintance over to the house . It could n't have been later than third grade . He had discovered early on the effect of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring outsiders by , easier to stay just outside the arms ' length of intimacy . But his little brother had somehow achieved membership in that envious class that Artie had long since banished himself from . His own flesh and blood had become a joiner  --  the very class that had persecuted Artie throughout school for having to base his image on intellect rather than social confidence . Little Eddie had arrived in the islands of the well liked , a place as mysterious to Artie as his father 's mythic town . His brother and he had inexplicably ended up in opposing camps . Aside from last night 's glimmer of a calamined summer on the Pacific , Artie 's memory of his own childhood was far less powerful than his recall of encyclopedia facts . His first vivid recollection of being driven out of the safe haven of simplicity was of one winter day when his father explained a joke that precocious.Artie had read in a book that lay beyond his six years : " A : There 's a man at the door with a package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Typically , Pop explained the punchlinc recursively , saying the joke itself sounded fishy to him . Only after little Artie wailed in protest did Dad explain the play on words and the obsolete cultural practice of cash on delivery . Artie recalled Dad proceeding to free-associate on fish names , telling ; his son , with the utmost urgency and solcnuiity , WIiat Iic claimed was the  | world 's longest palindrome : " Doc , note , I dissent ; a fast never prevents a fatness : I diet on cod . " And closing his eyes on the frozen-over front-yard football field , Artie could still summon the precise look of mysterious intensity filling the man 's face as he turned to his firstborn and said , " What 'll you give me if I say it backward ? " From that moment , the boy 's relations with the outside world carried the complication of two directions . Artie suspected the trauma that scattered his early memories beyond regrouping and the trauma that instructed him with childlike sensitivity not to bring friends over to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood that his folks , who in their Jersey heyday had been the epicenter for the Mid-Atlantic Charter of the **32;265;TOOLONG League , must have been compelled by the same decorum to make their steady decline out of sight . They became once-a-monthers at the Other Guys ' place . At last they achieved their current status , quarantined in Fortress Second Street , One-Oh-Three . Society itself had not outgrown the spontaneous visit , as Artie had for some time vaguely concluded . The Hobsons alone had something solicitors shunned and arbiters avoided . Yet somehow Eddie Jr . had escaped , immune . With his easy grace ? a trait lurking recessive in the Hobson genotype for generations  --  he made friends broadly and indiscriminately . Peers of both sexes genuinely liked him and , most remarkable to Artie , found nothing unusual in him or his old man . No doubt little Eddie ( this particularly filled Arthur with horror ) even joked away his dad 's pathology with these perfect strangers as lie had just tried to do with his brother . Artie would have winced thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause to think that he too had the first stages of Skylab sickness , he froze his face into a slate of pleasantry . Granted the girls had had their friends as well . Lily had even taken the extreme , although temporary , step of marrying outside the family . But tone of those developments alarmed Artie so much as Eddie Jr . ' s defection . His sisters were different , in a way that Artie would not dare to articulate to anyone of his own stratum . They were not true Hobsons , but liacl the name only on extended loan . He kept this distinction to himself , kilowing he could never explain his sexist medievalism to the enlightened oiganic fascists of his law-school class . Nor could he hope to convince his  | contemporaries that such a lack was not a failing but a freedom . Hobson 's Choice was one asset he would have gladly come out from under . Eddie , oblivious to all his brother mulled over , kept at the wisecracks . Adopting a falsetto , he said , " The Skylab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Artie looked over and smiled sweetly , Little Brother , understanding that he had transgressed worse by trying to appease , shifted back down ottava . He asked , " Well what do you think it is , really ? " The boys  --  those saddled with the liability of a lasting last name  --  began hashing out the fine points of what had until then been a politely avoided division of opinion . As his joke indicated , Eddie came down squarely in the **35;299;TOOLONG camp . What ailed Eddie Sr. , as far as his namesake made out , was part and parcel of the fellow himself . " Tell you what , Artie . I 'll grant the man is clearly in the middle of a medical catastrophe . But when has n't he been ? Sick for as long as we 've known him , anyway . He makes sure the fits get a little more devastating every year . It 's a tradition . Otherwise , it would n't be Pop . Can you imagine him completely well ? " He spun the football on end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a play-by-play . " Pop wants to be on this road . Nobody 's put him on it . Hell , Pop built the road himself . Pop is the road , no ? " It was n't clear whom he was convincing . " Maybe Granny toilettrained him with glaring lights and loud noises . That 's it . And now he 's got ta have it undone by analysis , has to cure himself by one of them .. . what 's it called , Artie ? " " Catharsis ? " Artie suggested , unpersuaded . " Yeah , one of them catheters , " Eddie smiled . First , he 'd cure his brother . ' Then they could talk about Dad . The whole unintelligible complex of symptoms seemed to Eddie easier to parody as an absurd infant trauma than to assault medically . Parody , at least , kept them uninfected . To Eddie , the art of the wince and blackout did n't hinge on anything ; it was simply the only way Dad could absorb the massive accidents that the Big Picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be crazier or less called for . He himself saw the everyday more as a reprieve than a punishment . Even the words to state his case against Dad lay half a step beyond his active vocabulary . " Pop wo n't let Pop alone . Passing out is just his way of dealing with himself . Oh , I do n't know . . . you know ? Know what I mean , bean ? " I Ic asked the yucstioi ,  | as a way of peacemaking , pretending the issues were still open . He knew without Artie 's ever having spoken a word to that effect that they came from as far across opposing sides of the tracks as imaginable . But he wanted badly to agree . Artie responded in litigant 's form , watered down so that Little Eddie would n't take to travesty . " Disagree . The way I see it , Pop 's disorder must he somatic . Lumps in the neck and armpits , for instance , are not your typical hysterical symptoms . We have to assume the disorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly , he remembered a night last summer , passing the bathroom door , hearing the man lurching his soft bowel up into the toilet . He felt a sympathetic cloud of nausea that made all negotiation for recovery pointless and repellent . At the remembered sound of his father 's pulpy , mulched insides hitting water , the sickness became real . He sat up . " What we need to do , since the fool is afraid of a walk-in clinic , is to get a copy of a Merck Manual or a Stedman 's dictionary and work up a differential diagnosis as systematically as possible . Otherwise , we 're reduced to guesswork . And the man wants to keep us guessing . " He did not look at his brother . He put his hands out in front of him to receive the football , and Eddie , without looking , lobbed it to him . " So what do you want us to do ? Traipse up to the librarian at De Kalb Public ? We think our Pop 's buying the farm . Got any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobered quickly . " Artie , if it were something real , the guy would have been dead years ago . " Eddie Jr . declined to follow up his point . For most of his eighteen years , he had lived for his brother 's occasional , affectionate nod . But now , when it mattered , he could not bring himself to concede to Big Brother 's plan . " You make it sound like we have to stop him this week or never . Christ , Artie , what 's waiting another month or two to see what happens ? " Eddie himself rejected this even as he said it . " We probably missed our last chance to help him five years back . " Artie did not admit that he 'd been waiting for Eddie to turn eighteen so that it could at last be the two of them against one . Here , on their hacks , on the hard ground , Artie saw that it would never be two against ( MC . It would always remain mixed singles . To assure himself that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an assortment of possible pathologies . Meantime , Eddie tossed  | the football straight up in the air , difficult from a prone position , snaring it one-handed . Artie would say , " Parasitic infection , " the ball would go whoosh , and Eddie would do his Raymond Berry . Then Artie would say , " No , stool 's normal , as far as anybody can tell . " He 'd say , " Brain lesions , " the ball would go whoosh , and so it went . By the time Artie proposed leukemia , Eddie had accumulated an amazing four hundred ? plus yards on shoestring catches , enough for the record books . Each might have forgiven Dad his illness had either held the other 's point of view . Eddie , hopelessly well adjusted , relied on himself as a model and assumed that everybody was equally capable of happiness . If miserable , they wanted to be . The wince was the wincer 's responsibility . Physical illness would have been okay by him . If Pop 's cells brought on his spells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy . Artie , on the other hand , would have forgiven Dad so trivial a thing as neurosis . But as he ticked off possible culprits  --  hypoglycemia , blood clots , Korsakoff 's syndrome , organic dissolution  --  he grew increasingly resentful of anyone who would stoop to intractable disease . To Artie , blame had less to do with sufferer 's guilt than survivors ' inconvenience . Although producing a lengthy list , Artie 's heart was n't in the diagnosis . Instead , he found himself marveling at the physics of Eddie 's tossed football . He was appalled at how such a thing could go straight up and still come straight down to Eddie , despite the earth having spun out from underneath it in the interim . He knew it had something to do with inertia , that there was an mi times m2 divided by r or r2 term in there somewhere . It seemed impossible and morally wrong , nevertheless . Artie recalled the Butterfly Effect , that model of random motion describing how a butterfly flapping its wings in Peking propagates an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's weather in Duluth . He played Name That Disease , I 've Got Symptom , but all the while more intent on imagining the storms Eddie 's harmlessly tossed ball would generate on the far side of the globe . In order to get the proper vantage on this rippling storm , Artie projected his view upward in the air , looking back down on the two overage and too-large boys . At first he could create nothing note dramatic than the famous crane shot at the train depot from Gone With the Wind , the one that prompted some die-hard reb at the Atlanta premiere to remark , " If we 'd had that many soldiers we 'd have won the  | war . " But gradually he managed a larger pullback , a grander dollying away , a logarithmic jumping out , until , in very few steps , he could no longer see the butterfly , Duluth , Peking , or even the space between . He collapsed telescopically back to planet surface when a voice , unmistakably his mother 's , broke in on their reserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ? " Ailene always unintentionally disturbed her children doubly by prefacing her disturbances with the genuine hope that she was n't about to be any bother . She doubled each interruption by interleaving every remark with the plea , " I do n't want to take up your time . " When the children were growing up , things had been very different . Mother had been far from deferential , seeming sometimes not to know the limits of maternal indignation . Her spit-moistened thumb , rubbed across churchgoing faces to lift off the dirt of too much playground , frequently lifted off tender skin and raised welts instead . But now the woman overacquiesced to her children , embarrassed at once having had to break them in . Like Lily , Mom kept a girl 's paint box in long-term storage at the bottom of the clothes closet . She was that peculiar late-century creature , the unwitting ironist . Born in one of those Oak Hill Park Forest Elm Grove places on Chicago 's North Shore , she had fled to the East Coast to escape the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban woman was forced into . Instead , she had collided with Pop outside Paramus . They married , and the man inexorably and against her will edged her back to within sixty miles of the nest she had tried to flee . While she had not yet ended up cleaning teeth eight hours a ( lay , her present emergency employment left her perilously close . Her inability to escape her destiny infused her actions with a certain fatalism . She knew that if her husband 's death did not intervene , she would inevitably have to take up residency in some division or subdivision or supersubdivision in Maple Vale Creek Crest Ridge and even at her advanced age be made to don the little white uniform and clean teeth until she died . " I do n't want to . . . I know you two are . . . " Mom began . Eddie sprang to his feet and , with a mock growl of " Get to the point , you mom , you , " shook her by the shoulders . Recalling from some long-lost quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he realized where lie had gotten this very gesture , and was shocked to notice  | how much the woman who had formerly dished it out had shrunk into the woman who now took her own punishment with a polite grin . " Your father , " she began , her grin broadening , " has said that he 'll go to the hospital . " " He what ? " Eddie yelped , then cut his mother off when she tried to answer . " How in the hell did you get him to do that ? " " I just asked him , " she said , and waited to be told that she had done good . But Eddie , while approving the results , knew that the method used to get them was terribly wrong . Thinking for two , he looked down quickly at his brother . But Artie lay on the ground , waiting for this brief disturbance to disappear in order to get on with the diagnosis  --  footballchucking game . At last Artie flashed a curious look , one that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face as of late . The look hung about the bushy area where his massive eyebrows ran into and merged with each other . Eddie recognized his brother 's look as the failed attempt to sidestep Hope : the old damned if Do , doomed if Don't.  | He is without doubt one of the most universally recognized figures in the world . Millions who could n't pick Stalin or Einstein or Chiang Kai-shek or Picasso out of a police lineup know his face . His acclaim is unmatched in recent memory . He is loved more broadly by more strangers than almost anyone who has ever lived , reaching this pinnacle of adoration by remaining an honorable and nice guy , with no personality flaws to speak of . Strangest of all , he has enjoyed this astonishing recognition for his whole life , which in 1940 is just over twelve years old . Anyone who has not witnessed it can not imagine his popularity . But everyone alive has witnessed it . His simple , trustworthy face and figure appear everywhere . Even those exceptional few who have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or smile or wave , still own some pennant or article of clothing with his picture on it . His image crops up several times a day without attracting notice . Most countries on the planet carry accounts of his adventures and exploits in the daily newspapers . His appeal is nonpartisan and ecumenical , uniting the most disparate men . Eleanor Roosevelt says her husband rarely plans an evening off without requesting his appearance at the White House . The same was true of King George V and the Royal Palace . Hirohito , too , is a great admirer . African tribes refuse to purchase bars of soap without his imprint . He is the toast of intellectuals , the wonder of the working class , the favorite of children . Ile has traveled the globe , pursuing adventures in far-flung places from the South Seas to the Sahara . He has labored at countless professions : explorer , inventor , magician , detective , cowboy , convict , castaway , trucker , tailor , sailor , whaler . He masters every sport . He speaks a dozen languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | He is , in short , a world phenomenon . And no one can quite say why . His stepfather attempts , unsuccessfully , to explain : Everybody 's tried to figure it out . So far as I know , nobody has . He 's a pretty nice fellow who never does anybody any harm , who gets into scraps through no fault of his own , but always manages to come up grinning . This hardly accounts for the gent 's hypnotic hold on the mind of the collective world . More plausible , if unpleasant , is the explanation of the last few years , of 1940 . The air of an old planet even now fills with new names : Blitzkrieg , Radar , Dachau . His immense popularity must come from our learning , in a few years , how to ignore things that would have frozen previous generations with total horror . In a world already lost , he is simply the finest provider of escape from the confusing , opaque , overwhelming , paralyzing , deadly serious , irreversible , and appalling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of current events , is untouched by the mass-murderous political impasse . That is why he 's welcome everywhere . That 's why we put his mug into the time capsule . As an enthusiast declares in an open fan letter , " Let there be one God , one Caesar , one Lincoln , one Napoleon , one Mickey Mouse . " The man behind the mouse is not half so well known . Disney supplies the world-renowned , high-pitched squeak , but his own speaking voice goes unnoticed at the other end of a phone . His picture appears in hundreds of magazines and newspapers and newsreels , but always in the company of his creation . Without Mickey by his side , countless unsuspecting admirers for whom he has made the present tenable pass him in the street . One photo of Walt , appearing in a popular magazine six years earlier , is remarkable for Mickey 's conspicuous absence . It shows Disney , not in some Never-Never Land but cocked behind a desk , dictating one of his famous Silly Symphonies into a black bullhorn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it goes into the electronic dictation machine . The recording device , his alter existence , is the secret land where he creates the alternate worlds that give the public safe haven . But these other worlds , cartoon realities synchronized to music , already make unfortunate brushes with reality . The most popular and successful of the Silly Symphonies , The Three Little Pigs , with its hit song of 1933 , " Who 's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf ? " coincides with Hitler 's appointment  | as German chancellor and the establishment of the Third Reich . Then there is Disney 's greatest gamble : For four years , he pits the prestige and economic resources of his studio in a make-or-break effort , a ninety-minute fairy tale . When Snow White at last appears in the year of the Anschluss , the war in Manchuria , and the Sudetenland crisis , it breaks all box-office records . But its story  --  a heroine poisoned by a wicked witch 's apple and resurrected by a prince with the aid of seven small allies  --  is construed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolationist debate . No matter what inspirations Disney spits into the black bullhorn , they emerge infected by outside events . This is nowhere truer than in his second great gamble , 1940 's Fantasia . The film , wedding images to classical music , is one of the screen 's towering achievements , among the most innovative since sound . As never before , Disney combines real figures with painted ones ; they talk and respond to one another within the same frame . The dramatic high point of the film , Mussorgsky 's " Night on Bald Mountain , " animates the final assault of the forces of Evil , only to give way to the apotheosis of Good in the guise of Schubert 's " Ave Maria . " But the public , in the guise of young Eddie Hobson , trained by the sparkling futures of World 's Fairs , never doubts the outcome of this Manichaean showdown . Eddie is far more excited about Mickey 's feature debut . Although Fantasia draws mixed reviews and falls far short of Snow White at the box office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if such a thing is possible . For young Hobson , the film 's highlight comes when Mickey pulls on Stokowski 's tuxedo tails , so neatly does the meeting ref iite all distinction between event and invention . Later in the film , Mickey has his narrative moment as Dukas 's " Sorcerer 's Apprentice . " Left alone by his master , who departs with prohibitions and grave warnings , Mickey can not resist the temptation to don the Hat of Power and use it for the most harmless task in the world : to help carry water . He animates a broom , a neat , recursive trick , to do the toting for him . He falls asleep and dreams of great might . He wakes to find the broomstick flooding the study . Grabbing an ax , he splits the broom in two . But the splinters leap up , each mindlessly pursuing the task he set them on but can not stop . If Little Eddie is too innocent to see the contemporary allegory , he still squirms in his seat at the classical dilemma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mickey ca n't give up and drown , but his  | intervention only aggravates the crisis . Fortunately for the mouse , master returns in the nick of time , rescuing the hero of millions and saving his movie career . Disney , in 1941 , develops broomstick problems of his own . He runs his empire as a benevolent dictator , in both bullhorn sense and otherwise . He demands of his employees the loyalty oath invented by his colleague Sam Goldwyn : " I want you to tell me the truth , even if it costs you your job . " Protest over Disney 's tyranny and his insistence on naturalistic drawing results in a mass resignation from his studios , the biggest group walkout in Hollywood history . The manufacturing of enchantment becomes especially tricky under the threat of complete business collapse . The only thing that saves Disney from ruin is the miraculous invention animating the single vote . How much can one vote count ? That depends on what 's being voted . If it 's the one vote that gets the Draft Act out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then one tally means everything  --  the beginning of the end of isolationist settlements , after a battle unforgettable for anyone who has witnessed it . The Great Debate polarizes the nation . It comes up as frequently and violently as ball scores . The country in 1940 is still willing to confront the subtleties of idealism . The isolationists , among them many powerful single votes including senators and congressmen , Lindbergh , Robert McCormick , and the popular rabble-rousing radio priest , Father Coughlin , stand firm in the long tradition of American moral noninvolvement . But the one vote that keeps the Draft Act alive through a storm of controversy is on the other hand a small enough margin to convince the Japanese that a surprise attack might go unanswered . Pacifism and nonconfrontation actually help draw us into war . The power of the lone vote depends on the perils of the issue . This year , the perils are your basic all or nothing : does the beautiful heroine come back to life and triumph over the witch 's poison ? Does " Ave Maria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do we drown faster by standing aside or by picking up the ax ? Does the world-famous mouse succeed in preserving a place where mass deportation and extermination do not and can not happen ? The issue being voted is the only issue there is . How much does one vote count ?  | If it 's Chamberlain 's vote , returning after the debacle of Munich , waving the signed paper around as proof : not much . But if the vote is Von Braun 's  --  a future colleague of Disney in a collaborative film enterprise called Man in Space , whose Hollywood biopic will be called I Aim for the Stars but who is currently working on reel one , " First , I Hit London " ? one vote erases many . How much does one vote count ? To the young Eddie Hobson , that depends on how the other guy votes . And those results are still out . When Secretary of War Henry Stimson at last dips his hand into the same bin used to pull draft numbers for the war to end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " World of Tomorrow " is dismantled to convert the area into a recruiting camp , the era of one vote comes to an end . The scale of things shoots off the top of the graph . The power of the local voice to tip the curve now seems miniscule , insignificant . Unless , of course , the local voice is larger than life . Although Admiral Yamamoto himself votes against the move , he plans and executes Japan 's successful attack on Pearl Harbor . We are once more unanimously at war . A majority of the American electorate does n't realize that it 's not going to be Teddy Roosevelt or even the romance of Pershing this time . But both legislatures vote unanimously for the declaration with one holdout , Montana 's Jeanette Rankin , the first congresswoman ever , who in a previous act of conscience also voted against our going into the First One . The opposing vote costs her her job . The vote is a remarkable enough " beacon , " as the high school texts call such things , that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoting ten words of voice-over to this woman 's action . Rankin says that she just wanted to show that a good democracy does n't always vote unanimously to go to war . But her one vote aside , the tally is unanimous : 82 ? 0 in the Senate and 288 ? 1 in the House for throwing our combined weight into the fray . Roosevelt allocates some number with a lot of zeros after it ? 50 billion , if memory serves for guns , and since everybody has been without butter for some time , he gets much the sum he 's after . What happened out at Hawaii was bad . But the common Joe reading the daily papers does n't know nearly how bad : pretty much the whole Pacific fleet , counting the other bases bombed that same day . The simple  | explanation for this ignorance is that the average Joe 's newspapers do n't carry the full story , do n't mention specific losses . The phrase making the rounds is " voluntary censorship . " To coordinate the voluntary , the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack , to provide a second line of defense should the newshounds fail to cooperate or should one reporter , fearing that another might break ranks and scoop him , leak a story preemptively . Information becomes the nation 's most valuable and protected commodity , and we can no longer afford to entrust it to individual hands . How much does one vote count ? It depends on who 's voting . One vote can be a doozy if it 's one Caesar , one Lincoln , one Napoleon , or one God . No sooner has the Great Debate over isolationism and neutrality faded forever and given way to the consolidated war effort than Disney gets a call from Henry L. Stimson , the secretary in charge of coordinating that effort . Stimson recruits the Disney studios into a crucial and unique role in the national mobilization . The request saves Disney from his labor strike and unites his new outfit in a common cause . The man who has combined live action and fanciful imagination , who taught the two to co-exist peacefully in the same frame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that he must now turn out , by the mile , morale raisers , training films , and propaganda . These cartoons , infused with a deadly new seriousness , will be instrumental in winning the most important theater of the campaign : the battle already called the Home Front . And why not ? The penchant for wishful thinking does not wither in front of a firing squad . Spring fashions do not stop permutating just because of sneak attacks . Perhaps they should . But even on the staging grounds for the final battlefield , the mind needs another place . The troops themselves , most just eighteen , are the first to admit that they need a decent Silly Symphony to see them through . The word animation derives from Latin meaning life , spirit , breath , courage . We will need these exact quantities in good measure if we are to survive . Besides , we have long ago lost our ability to know whether facts beat belief or the other way around . What the newsreels from Europe could not bring home , Welles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more frightening than fact , it must certainly have more power to delight . And the side that comes through this final fight still loving the  | exhausted , ruined world , the side with more delight , will be the winning side . Eddie Hobson learns of the news that will change his life one afternoon at the matinee , late in December of 1941 . Pearl Harbor has weeks before sealed his fate . The outcome is terminally uncertain . But that day , he hears the awesome power of a single vote enlist . Mickey Mouse goes to War .  |  | Dinner was a disaster . Everyone arrived at table euphoric with the news but determined to say nothing to jinx the turn of events . Even Dad was in good humor . He did not look like someone who 'd just agreed to surrender himself to the authorities . His topic of discussion that evening was The Drunk and the Lamppost , also called The Random Walk . Dad said it illustrated Brownian motion among other things . " Set a drunk up against a lamppost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then turns a random angle , continuing in this manner . Where will he end up ? " " Farther and farther from his starting position , in a random direction , " said Eddie Jr. , trying his hardest to please . " Back , eventually , at the lamppost , " said Artie , having read it . " The rehab clinic , " said Rach , in her helpful deadpan . This crack precipitated the blowup . Lily , a piece of pepper steak in her mouth , began to choke . Eddie Jr. , thinking her laughter a vaudeville take , began to laugh with her . When Lily went on gagging , Artie , finally thinking quickly , jumped up and whacked her on the back . Out came the offending piece of gristle . Lily jumped up just as quickly , smacking Artie kick for hitting so hard . When she recovered , she turned on Little Eddie , saying , " And damn you , too , you little sycophant . " Focusing her full anger on her sister , she narrowed her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider what your punchlines cost ? What we all pay to keep you in chuckles ? " She threw her napkin down and slammed off , barricading herself in her room . Artie sat back down in silence . Little Eddie looked as if he had just cut himself shaving . Rach sat upright , eyes and mouth wide . The bottom of hut face puffed out as if it had been slugged . " Somebody tell me what I sail . "  | " She thinks , " Dad explained , eye-twinkle only a little subdued , " that you were insulting me . " Ailene quietly folded her linen napkin and placed her silver perfectly at the side of her plate . She stood up demurely . " And you were . " Then she too disappeared , upstairs . Rach shook her head , still stunned . " Remind me to take my next vacation in Wisconsin . " She went to the front hall , put on her coat , and left for the Northern Lights . A minute passed as the dust settled . Artie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ta study . I leave you gentlemen to your own devices . " The two Eddies sat together , pushing food around on untouched plates . After a long silence , Little asked Big : " So tell me . Where does that drunk end up ? " Hours later , the house closed up for the night , Rach returned from the neighborhood bar and knocked on Lily 's door . Her sister 's " Come in " sounded almost cheerful . Nothing had happened : that was the way Lily meant to play it . Rach went into the room and sat on the antique armchair . She grinned , the kind that does n't know if it helps or hurts . At last , Rach asked forgiveness the only way she knew how . " Let 's play something . " " What ? " Lily asked pleasantly . Rach looked around the room . Her glance settled on Lily 's ancient Olympia typewriter . She hoisted it up onto the spool table between them , rolled a sheet of scrap paper into it , and began typing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sheet of paper and give it to you . Then you have to continue from wherever I leave off ? What do I win for guessing that ? I suppose there are more rules than just that . If there 's anything I 've learned from your darling games over the years , dearest sister , it 's that they are marvelously unencumbered ( pretty posh phrase for , one who 's never been able to tell the difference between posh and purple ) with any sense of purpose . Why are we playing this game anyway ? Ca n't you just come out and gim me that . Rule 1 is that you have to stop after EXACTLY two lines , and no fair going over from now on . Rule 2 is that there  | is no Rule 2 . How are we going to know which lines are yours and which mine ? I mean years from now . Of course there 's my impecunious way of handling the " e " key . Is " impecunious " a word ? Like I was saying before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to differentiate between mere whim and what the rest of the world commonly agrees on as reality . You never answered my simpering . Nor do I intend to . The fact that we ARE playing ought to indicate the futility of hankering over why . After all , Not that question . The one about how we 'll be able to tell who 's who . Should n't we start each line with an " L " or an " R " ? That way we raise the possibility of our " L " not knowing what our " R " is doing . Nope . It 's better without the IDs , because years from I disagree , Rach . Let 's do it playscript style . Otherwise , we 're just going to run into one another , create a conflict of identi Rule 3 is that you ca n't break off the last person 's thoughts and start something different .

We can avoid the problem all together by keeping the ' I ' s out from here on . Rule 4 : No ' I ' s " All right , " said her considerably less flighty older sister , wise beyond her years . Yet still something tugged at her , and she would have rectified ( potty joke ) the problem if not for a nervous if not to say apprehensive colon , thus : If you make one more rational protest , you 'll what ? Brain the poor woman ? If there 's no more " I " s than " you " s have to go too , ok ? Let 's do the whole thing in third person , " agreed the always fairminded Rachel . But the new rule rapidly bored her , and seeing as how it was her game , little sister thought clearly and carefully before making any sudden and potentially disastrous moves ( did n't she ? ) and decided that Rule 5 was that Rules 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I want them to apply . Got it , Lady ? Hey wait gim me help Now what kind of rules would they be , if the rules keep changing ? Two can play at that game . This is my typewriter , remember .  | Okayokayokayokay . So they repealed Amendment 5 , for Lily at least . Now both sisters had exactly what each one needed . Rules for the self  --  controlled , and anarchy for the animal . By this time , however , Lily was getting into it , and wanted to see just how far the sisters could sustain a thought without any barriers between them . They had , until this moment , been circling around the issue that was on both of their minds , if " mind " could be used to describe what stuff was in the younger one 's brain case . But just as they thought they had fallen into lockstep , the women discovered each other way off on opposite sides of the lamppost . Why do you always have to do that ? Saw the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd jump ship . I quit . No pouting , now . That one violated the pronoun rule . Also , the tacit rule about finishing a stanza all the way to the end , even steven . Getting that out of her system , Rach was ready to come to terms with the issue . Again they asked one another , " What IS the best way for those two mutual felons of Dad 's to stay out of the hoosegow ? That one does interest me , though I would n't in a mil lion years let the poor guy know it ? Of course not . You do n't think his problem is at all related to his daughter taking it on herself to torture him ? Not bloody likely . He loves it . Now stick to the point . How do those guys keep from ratting on each other ? Search me . Seems to me a clear cut case of trust begets trust , lack of trust begets lack of trust . Pass me the truffles , Tess . The curry Carrie . Gosh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why is it so bloody hard to get out of the Hymen League ? Believe me , you 're better off as is . Treat men as if they were walking encumbrances , if you want what 's best for you . Take me , please . Come off it , girl . So you marry a guy who threatens to hang himself to get your attention . That 's going to leave any body WHO 'S BEEN THROUGH IT a little shaken , yes . Gim me a cig . Gratias .

Just for that I 'm going to end my next three with periods . Why am I playing this with you if you wo n't cooper Well , sis , I wish I could tell ya ' . But I 'm afraid that 's a question that everybody is just going to have to answer for me . Now look . As usual , we 've degenerated . This is no better than trying to hold a conversation with you . I preferred it in third person , " she said . The nimble  --  witted Rachel agreed . Once again in lockstep , the dialectic duo of sibling synonyms forged ahead into research on Pa 's prisoner problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew what the other meant to do ahead of time . " True , " remarked her genetic alter  --  egg . " But they do n't . " Was she being laconic , or just coy ? The world would never know . For as in a flash , it dawned on both women that what they were really discussing , what really concerned them was their Alert alert alert : Rule 1 violation in sector A ? 7 . All rule ? police report immediately . If we let this go unpunished , then Rach , quit it . I 'm really scared . What if he 's going in too late ? I 'm not sure I still want to know what 's wrong with him . He is in no more danger now than he has always been . All we can ever do for him is stick around . But no sooner did Rach say this than the girls ' mother loomed up in the doorway , an imposing figure from a bygone era . With finger to mouth , she made it plain that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Dad from his much needed healing sleep . " You can  | " You can keep typing , " Ailene said . " Just type quietly . " Both daughters , products of the woman , knew that this meant " Quit typing . " Yet because they were enjoying a rare moment of mutual accord , neither wanted to break off negotiations just yet . " New game , " Rachel demanded . " Get the Ouija . " Lily stood on a chair and rooted around in the back of the closet 's top shelf . Neither had played with the beaten-up occult object for years . Lily brought the equipment down and dusted it off . They darkened the room and placed the board between them on their laps like seasoned mediums . They slid the heart-shaped pointer around the board , loosening up . Rachel commenced the questioning . " Oh , murky spirits from beyond the pale  --  it is pale , ' is n't it ? " " Just ask the question , " Lily hissed . " That 's what I thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to do with this spiritual racket too . Painted veil , and so on . " " Get serious , will you ? They wo n't show up if they think you 're goofing off . " " All right . Oh , mighty spirits from beyond the Snail , to whom do we have the pleasure of speaking ? " Their four hands lurched into low gear , and the device haltingly traced out : R-A-G-E R-A-G-E RAGE IN DU PAGE " Glad you could stop by , Mr. Rage , " Rachel said . " How are things in Dupage ? " The Ouija sputtered and spelled : THIS IS NNY GHT NOT A GAME Rachel giggled at the garbled spelling . " Well , it 's no picnic for us either . " Lily shoved her sister with her wrists and took charge of the interro gation . " Spirit , what can you tell us about where you are ? " WHAT LIKE WHAT INSTANCE The answer , however uncommunicative , excited Lily . " ' fell us a little bit about what it 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IMPOUNDABLE IMPONDER " Imponderable , Spirit ? Is that what you mean ? " Rachel cut off any answer . " Yeah , yeah . Heard that one before . You do n't have to lecture us on life 's little imponderables . You want imponderables ? How about telling me why I 'm the first person since Victorian fiction who has to address her boyfriends as Mr. ' " " That 's your own fault , woman . Stop going out with your married bosses . " Lily hushed her sister 's comeback as the hoard resumed . NOPCH COLD NOVEMBER NO POR " Spirit ? November ? " Lily looked at her little sister . " This is getting spooky , Rachel . " " Oh , pish . There is no way in hell this little piece of plastic crap can know diddly . Spirit , is Lily pushing the weejee , or what ? " N-O Y-E-S Their interlocked hands battled for control of the pointer , and Lily 's lost . She crossed her arms . " Quit pushing . Play right , or that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lily again linked little fingers . She commanded , " Spirit , can you tell us about our household ? " SIS GIX ARE The answer took two full minutes and much shuttling . " Great , " Rachel snorted . " That makes a whole load of sense , you insubstantial lump of ethereal ... " Lily interrupted . " No ! Do n't you get it ? He means there are six of us . " " ? Terrific . I could have told you that . Woulda gotten all the words right , too . And wait a minute . I low do you know it 's a man ? " " Spirit , arc you a man or a woman ? "  | CLAUDIA As the name spelled out , Rachel giggled . " Claudia ? Not the Claudia from my sixth-grade intramural field-hockey team ? " The Ouija spun around several times before spelling : NOCKEY " That 's funny . I was certain it was called hockey , with an h . " Rach looped the pointer across the board in figure eights . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . " This could be interesting , if you 'd just behave for ten seconds . Claudia , we 're trying to find out what is wrong with our father . He 's . . . he 's sick and getting worse . HAS HE PHYS Lily sat up , startled . " No , he has n't been to a physician , if that 's what you 're asking . He only today agreed to an exam . For our sakes . He does n't think it 's serious . But I guarantee you , it is . " The board shuddered and the women 's hands defined twin compasses . SEE SEES THINKS Each letter heightened Lily 's agitation . " That 's right ! " She shouted in a whisper . " He has some kind of hallucinations . " EYES EYESORE " Naw , not an eyesore , " Rachel objected . " Not the prettiest thing in the world , granted . But he 's not that ugly . " Her tone turned to righteous indignation . " We know he sees things , clot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure enough , they looked up to see Dad himself halfway inside the doorframe . " Poisoning my household with instruments of the Devil , I see . Ailene , behind him in the kitchen , protested that she had asked the girls to knock off hours ago . " But they 're too inconsiderate to think of anyone else but themselves . " " Who is n't ? " Dad asked , joining his daughters . As the soft glow from the kitchen spilled into the room , Rachel turned to her sister and asked , " What does that do to Claudia ? Does n't she die if light gets on the board while she 's talking ? " She screwed up her face , trying to remember her Black Magic . " She 's already dead , " Lily laughed , self-conscious . Dad sat next to them , forming a small circle . He gave the Ouija a look between revulsion and ridicule . " T'he one value I try to instill in you two over the years  --  the single burden I place on you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny bit rational about what you believe . And look at the two of you . Just look at you . " He snorted good-naturedly , enjoying cornering the cabal . Lily looked down and toyed with her nicotined nails . Her hands shook , a fight-or-flight mechanism . She scaled up for the inevitable confrontation when Rachel came to her rescue . " But Meester Ed , jew shood haf seeen theese women Clodeene . She come to tell us all abowed was wrong weeth jew . " Lily looked at her sister , dumbfounded , unable to believe that the woman could talk to Pop like that to his face . She herself would no more have mentioned Pop 's illness in his presence than ask an amputee if he needed a hand . The man would have taken her apart , laughing all the way . Lily had been condemned to circumspection by her mother 's example , and could never understand how Rachel had escaped to become the Mrs. Simpson of family propriety . Ordinarily , she would have kept her head down out of the crossfire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sister 's lead . We were asking it all sorts of questions , really . " Lily kept her voice as blase as possible , given her adrenaline level .  | " Theese woman say jew be seeing the ah-beese , " Rachel said , unrepentant . She traced out a wild pantomime of letters across the board with the plastic heart . " She toll us , from b'yon de grave , ask jew jewselves . ' Dad aped back , greatly amused . " She said that , did she ? Now there is something worth looking into . Let 's give this another try , shall we ? Mind if I sit in on a session ? " Lily certainly did mind . But Rule 0 was never scrap with the old guy unless you were ready to go all the way to the brink with him . She was not ready for brinksmanship tonight , so she cleared a little space for him at the magic message board . " What 's the theory behind this piece of malignant machinery ? " Lily scowled , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no theory behind it , Dad . Only ghosts . Just keep your fingers on the pointer as lightly as possible . And ask it what you want to know . " Rachel began once again . " Hola , Claudia ? Come in , Claudia . Claudia , this is Mission Control . Do you copy ? Over . " Slowly , the board returned to life under new management . N-N-N CLAUDIA NIX NOT " You 're not Claudia ? " Lily sounded disappointed . " Who are you then , Spirit . Where did Claudia go ? " MMQX YYT XKKX The board failed to reach consensus under its six hands , partly because Rachel was laughing so hard . " Oh , I remember him . The little guy , from the Superman comic books . If he says his name backwards , he 's got to go back to the fifth dimension . " Pop remembered the same comics , the caped hero of the world 's crisis decade who everyone hoped might arrest the rapid deterioration of real events . Suddenly , the needle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I LIKE YOU RACH By the time the note came clear , Rachel was ready to fight . " All right Which one of you did that ? " Lily and Pop denied cvcrOhing . Well just  | cut it out , all right ? This is n't a game , you know . " She rabbit-punched them both for good measure . Pop took his turn at framing a question . With great seriousness , he asked , " Spirit , is there a God , and can he show two forms of ID ? " The pointer reeled , insulted . ELO AB TWO AND MORE HORATIO The answer delighted him . " Well-read creature we 're dealing with , here . Can you do the hollow crown ' soliloquy from Richard II ? " The letters began : UNEASY LIES then stopped as suddenly as they started .

All right , then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what 's playing in Hobstown these days ? " NOW PLAYING IS NOW PLAYING " Get to the point , will you ? " Rachel shot a look at both the board and Pop . COME TO TOWN AND SEE Rachel slapped the Ouija . " Bratty kid . Okay , let 's ask this thing another way . " She shot a look at both blood relations , testing them . " Are we ready for tonight 's Big Question ? " Lily said , " Ready , " but did not sound it . Pop said , without flinching , " Ready here , boss . " Rachel paused , then backed down . " Go on , Lil . It 's all yours . " Lily gave her sister a withering look . She took a breath and addressed the linked hands : " Spirit , can you give us some idea about what it is that I ) ad sees ? What brings on the spells ? And are the , you know , vomiting and fever and sores all part of the same thing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What she means is , WHAT HELL WRONG OUR POP ? " THERE IS MORE All held their shared breath , but the board stopped . Finally Lily could stand it no longer . " Yes ? Go on . More what ? " MORE TO ANY THAN ANY SUSPECTS  | Ailene sat in her kitchen listening to the seance scratchings ? = " . long after the mediums went to bed . She sat alone at the table that perpetually doubled for meals and cards . No one told her what messages had arrived from beyond the grave , and she did n't inquire . Some things she saw no advantage in asking . Near the top of her rules of thumb was her deep belief that people made things more complex than they were . People meant , for Ailene , her children . Her husband . She went to the sink and fetched a damp rag , then ran it over the spotless table . Back at the sink , she wrenched it out and spread it over the faucet . She drifted to the radio on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out , tuned to no station in particular . Calmed by the background sounds , she sat down . She was not born suspecting complexity . But , then , she was not born married to Ed Hobson . She had attained simplicity over the years as a counterweight to the man , to keep their marriage near the American complexity median . When Ed turned the breakfast table on its ear with noxious , logical knots like the prisoner 's problem , it fell to her to insist that , with the right rules of thumb , the problem vanished . That was her cyceted line . That was her . But the simpler a counter she grew to Ed , the more he disappeared in ctiilicues . No one would have given his breakfast-table bind another thought if they did n't know the man like their own breathing . His mind Has a maze , an overly ornate metaphor . Everyone knew at once that his I.itcst thought game spoke for him . Him and them . Just the way he 'd du.iwn it on the paper towel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the riddle . Slic suspected , alone in the kitchen , sitting in the dusk of the forty-watt 1. iiigc light , that the way out of the paper-towel prison , her way out , the  | way Ed could not find , was merely for each man to say to himself and no other , " I must choose not to compromise myself , as if no one else is implicated in the deal . " Forget the complex consequences ; damn the other guy 's doublethinking . If Ailene had learned anything by living a life attending to the needs of others , it was that the two in the trap could only escape conviction through conviction . So simple : they had to do what they thought was right , no matter where it led . There was a time , years hack , when she troubled herself over those Teach Yourself the Great Thinkers series . But as far as she could make out , Kant 's Categorical Imperative , which she perpetually saw paraphrased in those books as " Each of us must act in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded to her suspiciously like the Golden Rule , handed down to her as " Do unto others as you would have others do unto you . " The only difference was in the fancy packaging . You needed an advanced degree to appreciate the former , whereas everybody learned the latter in first-year Sunday School . Because of this difference , the Golden Rule inspired Ailene while Kant 's dictum filled her with shame . Kant helped mirror her favorite regret : her never attending college . When Ed was not holding forth at dinner , she sometimes sneaked in the story of how , just four days before she graduated valedictorian of her high school , she was asked by the school guidance counselor , a not-so-closet alcoholic , what university she would attend the following fall . Explaining that she had no means to get through college , she was shocked to see the fellow pull from its shelf , far too late to be of any help , a massive tome that had not been touched in any semester in recent memory : a two-thousand-page index of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive book became her life 's icon . It stood for all blocked opportunities and missed chances , the " what ifs " of dashed hope , those matters of concealed occasion that were common knowledge to everyone else on this earth . Yet late at night , the same thick volume reversed its role and comforted her . Because the cash prizes of this life came bound and maintained in a handy reference work cross-indexed by place , amount , and designation , she slept well , knowing that even though she stopped short of where she might have gone , her children did n't have to , Salvation was simple and indexed . Answers were alphabetical . All we had to do was look .  | Reminded of lists and indexes , she stood and crossed to the pristine counter . She fiddled for a moment in the accumulation of depleted pens , calendar pages , and phantom match covers scrawled with forever unidentifiable phone numbers that nested between stove and refrigerator . She passed through the pile twice , forgetting what she was looking for . She came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She sat back down and considered the blank page . No , she reaffirmed ; four more years of higher education would only have confused her , obscured what she already knew , the only thing she needed to remember , whether she called it Kant or canticle : do what was best for the common good . She touched the pencil tip to the paper , freezing there for a full minute before sweeping : 1 doz eggs Her script was perfect , an exact replica of those cursive loops from third-grade writing texts that most children never got closer to than rough approximation . As she wrote , she decided that the additional diploma , the superfluous degree , would have left her worse for the weathering . She had seen what upper-level sociology and psych courses had done to her husband . She had met , dated , and married an overgrown boy who returned to school after the service an idealist , seeking technical skills that would let him contribute to a better postwar world . He went into college an altruist but came out an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond recovery by that collegiate puzzle called the Tragedy of the Commons . As she had it paraphrased from Ed , the question ran : when the world grows too small to support everyone , who will let their livestock starve so that the others will have though common grazing ground ? Survival favors the self-interested . And so , educated , we all perish together , protecting our private claims . Outwardly Ailene proclaimed her inadequacy , her lack of education . But inwardly she knew that four years of self-sacrifice and debt would only have taught her that Do Unto Others did n't go nearly far enough toward prescribing who , exactly , could do how much of the grazing . Nor would additional letters after her name have led to a solution . Once 0.11 fed , the attempt to salvage simplicity would have led her , as it had Ed , into the province of the eternal postgraduate , or worse . So Ailene , shame  | notwithstanding , happily avoided throwing bad knowledge after good . Not quite happily , but steady of hand , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye to family health , she soured her nose and added , in parentheses : skimmed . She had much too much native intelligence to live in naive bliss . Since she could not have the degree without the attendant confusion , she asked only for a small , peopled garden in some tillable spot of the globe , governed by mutual respect and free from competing interests . She designed her household toward this end . On husband and children she bestowed unledgered , endless acts of affection  --  soaking undergarments in bleach , washing up after them , drawing up shopping lists , stocking the larder . All this she did without complaint , never doubting that her family would , in their own time and manner , repay her invested trust and return the favors when needed . Tonight they were needed . She was those simple acts of trust . Things would be simple if only we let them . Back when she and Edward still socialized , she had enjoyed being the ingenue at gatherings of that small circle of high school teachers they had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around : she made them feel sophisticated and subtle in comparison . She knew her part , and early on mastered the little-appreciated social art of saying only the extremely self-evident . While all the circle struggled to deliver clever or controversial points of view , she spoke so far beneath contradiction that others dropped in their tracks with stunned smiles . For that they loved her . But her socializing days were history . She tried not to think of the night it had all started to unravel , and in rapid fire added to her growing list : 3 lb gr beef head lettuce brocc of small sack potato  | She broke off violently and exhaled . She tore off the note she 'd been nursing and flipped it over . Listlessly she traced out three ovals , then wrote : I should have started a diary thirty years ago , back in the fifties . Now I ca n't even remember what happened when . But she had no difficulty remembering what had happened the night Ed first collapsed in public . It was at a teachers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed had taught history for the first seven years of his career . Ailene had never seen anything like it happen before to anyone , let alone the man she tailored her life around . He had not , back then , developed the practiced , insouciant air with which he managed later fits . He even went so far , in this first public crash , to point , scared witless , at whatever had ambushed his retinas . Obviously not the average passing-out , nor benign enough to ignore . But that 's what she tried to do , at first . Ed crumpled onto a chaise lounge , streaming word-salad as if truly schizophrenic . He had been doing this tremendous baritone imitation of Sinatra , " A Sinner Kissed an Angel , " and all at once he was elsewhere . Somebody thought he 'd hit his head on a nearby shelf , knocking himself down . Another bystander insisted he 'd gone into the fit first and slammed his head only afterward . Ailene stood in the center of the room , thinking it was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried the old trick of stating the self-evident for all she was worth : " My husband has fainted . " It did n't work this time . For Eddie , although far from conscious , had not fainted . He was simply intent on that steady word stream , trying to attract the other partygoers toward something that seemed to lie not next to the divan , nor on the wall of the room , nor in the yard outside . The sight he tried to ward off lay far away . Ailene insisted the fit was just too much booze on an empty stomach , but that would n't wash either . His colleagues had long revered Ed I Iobson as every schoolteacher 's drinking mentor . No matter how much he drank , he never got smashed beyond reciting Kipling 's " If , " teary-  | eyed , in booming bass , but unslurred . One woman in social studies said she 'd seen this before . It was a stroke , and if they did n't get an ambulance here within three minutes the man would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , if he lived . But Eddie , reemerging on cue , refused to let anyone call an ambulance . The more his friends protested , the more violent he became . From the vantage of her belated , one-page diary , Ailene saw that this refusal to treat the thing , Ed 's rejection of the socially prescribed treatment and not the illness itself , had lost them their visiting privileges , their niche among the others . She wrote : First he got sick . Then he turned down the amenities . That 's when he got in trouble . That brought on the tribunal . That 's when we started to move . During the remainder of the school year Ed 's fellow teachers showed what they thought of the incident : the man was mentally ill , and contagiously , judging by the sudden drop in invitations Eddie and Ailene received . At the end of the term , Eddie collected his fifth straight Outstanding Teacher Award , which he left on the assistant principal 's desk just prior to their leaving town on what , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ailene replayed in her mind the family 's slow descent into gypsyhood . She found the sequence impossible to recover , mainly because her own relations with her husband had remained unchanged throughout . The only complaint she allowed herself  --  and only at her lowest moments , never outside the breakfast circle  --  was the cheerfully stoic , " After all , I 've signed the papers . " This meant she felt legally bound never to develop a muscle tick 's difference in her feelings toward Eddie from those she had had the day they drew up the marriage contract . Looking over the perfect script of her chronology , she found that keeping her part of the bargain had always come easier than the outside might have suspected . She felt a wave of shame at how she had blossomed on the compost of Eddie 's decline . Her husband 's trail of crises brought out the best in her . She had learned , under fire , to issue the quick cover-up and invent the ingenious  | excuse . His suffering required her ; she filled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gave Ailene that whiff of forbidden tragedy , her one graspable proof that things did happen now and again in a daily canvas that otherwise insisted experience exists only far away  --  the Middle East , Asia , or Washington , D. C. His were the only headlines she believed . Newspapers announcing PRES BLOCKADES REDS or SAIGON CHAOS AS EMBASSY TOPPLES had an unnatural urgency , as wholly implausible to her as JESSICA TELLS TED SHE HAS BEEN MARRIED BEFORE Or LIZ BEARS ALIEN 'S BABY . Without Ed , she had no front page , no news : only warehouse clearance circulars and advice columns . She understood , without benefit of college degree , that the price extracted for the model life , the one she was supposed to strive for , was anesthesia . Ordinary blessedness required that the occasional incident ? burglary , car accident , or siren  --  never came closer than a block or two away . She felt how easily she might have become that dutiful mother who troops her kids in single file , stands them in front of the once-in-alifetime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See ? This is what you get when you play with matches . " But her husband 's constant , low-grade emergency showed her how such women 's children always hear them lying . Kids know otherwise ; the lesson of every other day is that matches can not harm them , nor the one-in-a-million bolt from the blue . Blessed children already sense the steady , blank lay of the terrain . They mouth , " Sure Mom , " the Good Fairy , their faces baked in the neighbor 's blaze , all the while shaking their heads No Chance , as if death by fire were theater . No , Eddie had for years been her only current event , and for that she was almost grateful . She loved the threatening thrill that unemployment brought twice every decade . She cared little for security or money , and could have made do on occasional ten-dollar gift certificates from friends . She gladly traded steady income for a cause . Ed 's expulsion required of those nearest him only that they sacrifice small amenities ? security , comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precinct  --  in order to regain the lost capacity to know and feel . And as much as she hated to see the least anxiety shade her children 's faces , this continuous domestic disaster , at least , gave them something tangible . Crisis , at least , was real .  | She never spoke of her great , unpublished discovery . His worsening bouts denied interpretation . He coughed up solid mass and remarked , clinically , " Ah ! Blood . " He was upstairs disintegrating . There was no lesson . If Hobson 's sickness was Ailene 's one harbor , his refuge refused her altogether . She took the pencil tip out of her mouth and wiped it dry . She added to her shopping diary : Just around then , he started Hobstown . Or maybe just before . I should have written it down as it happened . I ca n't remember sequence anymore . She tried to imagine the project that had taken him over , the one hobby he still enjoyed . She knew little about the place , but linked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First one had happened , then the other . And ever since , her husband periodically removed himself from here to build this other place , the last monastic in the age of community . Every move he made was a Protestant 's bid for Blessed Saint of Indifference . And Hobstown was his hermitage , reliquary , shrine , his chapel to the virtues of doing without . Three decades back , when she had just gotten used to marriage , her husband produced a pair of pinking shears , a bridal-shower gift from a girlfriend Ailene had long lost track of , and relieved her of her hard-won credit cards with a few deft snips . Not that Eddie questioned her least expense . She , if anyone , pulled the pursestrings . Every cent of cash he had he gave her willingly . He simply could not live under the umbrella of credit , owning the unpaid for . Ailene , with a sense of wonder that grew daily , found she had married the last man in America who could n't owe money . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was n't there to begin with . Everything that Edward practiced , the table talk , the pedagogical riddles , the banter , the bluster , the evasive employment pattern , even the passing out : everything preached one and the same thing . Hobstown was the only sovereign state ever to practice the principle of complete self-sufficiency : sacrifice everything , pare it away until all that 's left is the unencumbered mystery of getting along with , for , and by yourself . The only thing she knew for certain about her husband 's endless sessions with the tape machine was that her favorite rule of thumb about  | things being simpler than people made them out simply did not apply . And if it did n't apply to her husband 's model town , it did not apply to him . And if not to him , then her own home could burn down at any moment , sacrificed to the bonfire of complexity . She put the possibility out of her mind . She had narrowly escaped that danger . For today , things had changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . Soon , his sickness would become material , hard stuff under the touch , properly attended to . Soon the doctor would hold up in front of her the unintelligible film collage of X-ray grays and point out , " Here . This spot here is wrong . " Soon the violation of his sick chest would become harsh and definite , stark contrast to the regular and newsless days . For today , Eddie had vowed to take the cure , go public . Perhaps no treatment , at this late a date , could interfere with or improve the course of the disease . But the tests , medications , and prognoses themselves , each a narrative with pacing , drama , character , and denouement , were worth their weight in secondary symptoms to Ailene . Soon she would have a word for what was wrong with Edward . She would have the experts ' name , the name in the medical manuals . And then she could translate the agreed-on term into Hobson dialect . The I Iobsons , who had their own words for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eavesdroppers , defined club membership , condemned one another to intimacy , would soon have to accommodate a flew term . Years before , when the world still smelled of well-floured hands , Ailene had compromised with the kids . Wanting to squeeze the most use out of the few hours allotted them between their release from school and consignment to dinner , they refused to keep to the backv ird and insisted on ranging the neighborhood . Her working agreeWilt with them extended the Hobson grammar : three shrill blows oil a metal drill whistle , rescued from Ed 's lifeguard stint at Aptos , meant they had five minutes to get back , scrub , and be seated at table . SIR ' could still recall the sound : six P.M. on a summer 's evening , brrilll three times from the back stoop , and through every plate-glass front mom on the street , in each neighborhood child 's heart in no matter how distant a sandlot or park , most of all in the blood of the children to  | whom the whistle dictated , there registered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking to themselves . What this whistle no longer obliged in her children , Ailene could reclaim by Latinizing the disease . A new word could call them in and remind them : blood . The old mystery of sacrifice and connection needed a name . They had learned the watchword sacrifice from the man . Could they not now teach him new vocabulary ? She carefully inverted the pencil and touched the eraser to the paper . After a last look , she rubbed until the whole brief history she had written that evening dispersed , returning the sheet to its white simplicity . She flipped the paper over and looked at the other list , the groceries : her way back to the golden rule . Ailene stood up , walked over to the refrigerator , and attached her shopping list to it with a free magnet . She opened the fridge , which Edward , stubborn thirties holdover , still insisted on calling the Ice Box . Inside , she thumbed the dial down from 7 to 6 . The machine lumbered to a halt , cut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radio , which had drifted just wide of the nondescript station she had set it to . For the last few minutes , it had sprayed a fine mist of static into the room without her hearing . Then she walked stoveward and flicked off the range fan which had been going since dinner , drawing off the suspended fats and airy colloids and storing them , inoculated , in internal hidden reservoir . Silence sprang up , thunderous silence , stripped of the background tracks that had accompanied her evening . In the audible silence , Ailene committed to memory today 's date . Today , Eddie had made a historic concession . She left the forty-watt bulb on over the sink , in the event that her children might wander down at night . Children needed something to sec by , as a rule of thumb . After one last worldly inspection , she gave the kitchen a final salute before taking the trip upstairs . Safe in the bedroom , she moved silently in the dark , so not to wake the invalid . She went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hid , extricating a folder marked " Keep . " She read , by closet light .  | behind closed door , Eddie 's trail of long untouched insurance documents , to see if any still applied . For he had given her the green light . Her trust had been returned with trust . Tonight , they had arrived at a place she had never , for three decades of marriage , doubted . Every reef connected underneath . Tonight , she had news . Ailene knew her husband 's every spell was elaborate Hobson lingo for " Nurse me . " And now she would .  |  | SPRING . 1942 Eddie Hobson 's local urgency scrapes up against the Big Picture in February 1942 , two months after the laps bomb Pearl Harbor and we enter the war . The collision of inside and out begins unnoticeably . The world around him mobilizes , but Eddie 's life is unchanged . He goes to silly matinees . He dances the Lindy and the Big Apple . He sings his sixteen-year-old waiter 's heart out on the Hudson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper , and rubber drives . He turns in used toothpaste tubes . He lives his life around his parents ' ration stamps . He polices his neighbors ' minor violations of home-front thrift by repeating the popular refrain , " Do n't you know there 's a war on ? " But in America , the one untouched , enchanted island in a world submerged in bloodletting , the war is not always obvious . Only the occasional State Department telegrams to newly minted gold-star mothers affirm it . And in early 1942 , these have not yet begun to come home in earnest . Consumer hardships aside , the biggest impact of the war in ' 42 is the awakening of American exuberance , the delight in the fight . Neighborhoods take to the conflict with violent enthusiasm , aggressive confidence that shocks the world . The country 's spring cleaning , dusting away musty isolationism , rumbles its dormant strength , announces the arrival of its hour . It celebrates its jazz-age boundlessness , its Copeland fifths performed by backwoods brass choirs . These things waited for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packages go to war . Its March of ' 42 fashion magazines ask " What 's New ? " The answer is Elizabeth Arden sporting service cap aml monkey wrench , a two-page cartoon spread on the consequences of drifting women , and a buyer 's guide to refrigerators , although no new mlri , ' erators can be had at any price . " Our charming young model goes  | backstage at the Imperial Theatre to sell a Defense Bond to Danny Kaye . . . . For this big moment , she chooses a two piece faille suit in a new high shade . . . . $19.95 . " We join this epochal shoot-out , but on our terms . We wake up . We will buy this victory . Boys will win it with scrap drives . Myrna Loy will win it by sassing Hitler . Thomas Hart Benton already paints the victory celebration , complete with dusty fiddles . We 're flexing in Motor City on the armaments line . Flexing at Hollywood and Vine and on the family farm . For the first time it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coarse Oakie , coarse Rocky Mountain , coarse Lower East Side . Coarse will come out of this conflict leading the world . And everyone else on the block will have to learn to play by our rules . The rules of the Empire State spire , Iowa Corn Boil , Appalachian Spring , Broadway Boogie Woogie . The Depression is finally sealed . The Dust Bowl becomes Ma load , who in turn becomes Jane Darwell . Two months after the sneak attack , it seems as if we were itching for it , daring the enemy to do it . Now we set out on a global enterprise , ebullient , charged with energy . The war is not about civilian bombing , torture , deportation , people hiding in shelters or burned out of foxholes . The war is about righting wrong with unprecedented industrial production , Tit for Tat . But before we can fully celebrate our strength , we must address the fact that the Arizona has gone down , and the Oklahoma , with at least fourteen other ships sunk or badly damaged at Pearl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our coast and the laps . That 's enough to turn what is still called national sentiment toward defense at any cost . In February 1942 , our national exhilaration explodes against the Japanese , all Japanese , even Japanese of our nationality . A spontaneous outcry , both among administrative higher-ups and ordinary , government-issue citizens , insists our national interests are threatened by those eighth-ofa-million Japanese Americans living up and down our now unprotected West Coast . This untested element , sitting on the vulnerable Pacific rim , might take the opportunity to do guerrilla work or reconnaissance for the Imperial Army . Then again , they might remain forever as blameless as they are at this moment . But national sentiment , the disgrace of peace-with-honor  | sympathies , and the stakes involved in guessing wrong , make it impossible , so goes public reasoning , to gamble on good behavior and lose . How endangered is California ? Could we really be attacked ? What threat these AJAs  --  Americans of Japanese Ancestry  --  really represent is never spelled out . But the general alarm centers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like . FDR puts through a proposal in mid-January : all aliens must register with the U.S. government . On February 20 , 1942 , Dr. Win-the-War writes another prescription , stronger but just as silently mandated . Roosevelt approves of a plan to round up more than one hundred thousand of these Japanese Americans ? Iwo thirds of them American citizens . They are forcibly removed from their homes and shipped inland for safe internment . The government builds concentration camps in Colorado , Montana , Utah . There is no other good name for these prison villages , surrounded by barbed wire and manned by armed guards . They are built for the express purpose of imprisoning our internal enemy . By rough calculation , 90 percent of all Americans of Japanese extract are rounded up . This includes not just issei , or foreign-born Japanese nationals , but also more than 60,000 nisei , first-generation American citizens empowered with every constitutional right enjoyed by the FBI agents who come to arrest them . Altogether , more than 112,000 civilians are herded off to the camps and kept there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their number are UCLA graduates to whom kanji is Greek , whose idea of preserving their heritage is wearing a kimono to the costume party following the Bruins ' homecoming game . Fathers , mothers , and little children end up on opposite sides of wire fences . Some are kept in animal stalls until space opens up in the permanent camps . Students at ilollywood High , sons and daughters of directors and starlets , come to class one morning to find that their buddies , sons and daughters of studio executives and scriptwriters , are mysteriously absent . The emergency-evacuation project is smoothly and adeptly administered . People who have committed no crime and who are not charged with any must sell everything they own at fire-sale prices , strip down to two suitcases , and hop flatbed trucks to relocation centers . People are arrested In evening dress , coats and ties , work aprons and blue collars . Many are  | issued prisoners ' clothing : denim with stenciled numbers . Each receives an internee 's record they must keep with them : name , roundup date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government stationery printed with the message , " KEEP FREEDOM IN YOUR FUTURE WITH U.S. SAVINGS BONDS . " It 's a messy business . Earl Warren , making a brief stop as California attorney general on his way to the U.S. Supreme Court ten years later , adamantly backs the roundup . Some suggest he 's pressured by protectionist interests , eager to remove the Japanese small businessman from the land of free competition . Maybe he is , maybe he is n't . Can we afford to take a chance and see ? Once sabotage is done , it 's too late to admit mistakes . When , two days after Roosevelt 's approval of the internment , a Jap sub shells a Santa Barbara oil refinery , opposition to the idea collapses . A few fire balloons explode on the Oregon coast , making the move seem increasingly prescient , albeit ugly and indiscriminate . Better alive and compromised , say most , than virtuous and overrun . But when weeks go by and no more attacks against the mainland materialize , no one thinks about the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppose the measure . The arms have already been taken up in other operations , other countries . Besides , what can anybody say ? To oppose what everyone else deems a necessary evil is to be a collaborationist . The mass imprisonment is one small and mostly overlooked step in the largest and fastest mobilization the world has ever seen . One sacrifice in a time of nationwide sacrifice . Everybody does his or her bit , however indirect , for the collective cause . Some people are shot out of the sky , some people work the USO , some people go to camps . Housewives save fat and Ford converts to manufacturing aircraft . Old men go back to work ; women smelt iron and build ships . Girls raise victory cabbage . Boys who do nothing but dim lights and keep their lips sealed contribute to the fight . All industries , even the frivolous , do their part . Hollywood enlists en masse . One fifth of Tinsel Town dons uniform . Some see actual combat . Others do the invaluable work of spelling out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are recruited by the Signal Corps for their own film unit . The pictures they make fuel , define , and sustain this national awakening . Disney already has ideas for any number of films : morale raisers ,  | J cartoons conscripting Mickey , Donald , and the gang into the war effort . They can put Minnie to work raising yams in a victory garden , if that 's what it will take to win the vast showdown . His studio is occupied by an antiaircraft unit for eight months until the panic over impending invasion dies down . ( In case of air raid , goes the L.A. joke , go directly to RKO : they have n't had a hit in years . ) When he gets the call from Stimson , Disney promises to turn his studio into one of the most powerful weapons for winning the home front . More than a third of his prewar personnel are conscripted , but are returned when the importance of their work is made clear to the local draft board . The unofficial slogan circling the animation office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bait . " After several secret sessions in D.C. , impassioned presentations by the government , Walt flies back to L.A. and enters a flurry of production . His staff puts a hundred short subjects into the pipeline . Among the first are twenty films teaching spotters how to identify enemy airplanes . Next comes a trailer called The Winged Scourge , with a cameo by those seven model citizens , Snow White 's dwarves . The film is not about the Luftwaffe but about how the average foot soldier can guard against malaria . There 's also Chicken Little , an anti-Nazi condemnation of mass hysteria , and The New Spirit , in which everybody 's favorite , irascible duck learns to pay his income tax so that the country can stay solvent long enough to purchase the triumph . Nobody uses the term propaganda , but that 's what the films are . Technically , Disney 's great achievement of these months commences with Victory Through Air Power , begun in the spring of ' 42 . The work is a tour de force , combining live action and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the team that created Bambi , five years in the making . Victory is done in a little over eight months , even though its script is rewritten throughout production as its predictions come true and become outdated . The finished product so impresses Churchill that he asks FDR , at the Quebec conference , why the latter has never seen it . Roosevelt has no answer , so a special print is flown up by fighter plane from New York . The president is so excited by Disney 's aircraft choreography that he forces the Joint Chiefs to see it . Only this way do the Allies ensure adequate air protection for the Normandy invasions in June of ' 44 . But in these early days , the crowning burst of animate ingenuity comes  | when Walt gets the studio composer Oliver Wallace to write him a burlesque tune which his artists turn into an animated nightmare where Donald Duck finds himself forced to work in a Nazi munitions factory . Der Fiihrer 's Face , performed by the musician/comedian Spike Jones , instantly becomes one of the era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We is the Master Race , " We Heil ! ( phhht ) Heil ! ( phhht ) right in DER FUHRER 'S FACE . The song is a Bavarian beer-hall polka done in phony accents , a bit of impudent silliness in the face of the terminally horrible , only conceivable in America . Punctuating the " Heils " with raspberries is so enchantingly insulting , such a triumph of the average , irreverent schmuck over the titanic forces behind the crucible of history , that the ditty takes the world by storm . The lyrics are translated into a dozen languages , and a film print is smuggled onto the Continent through the underground , where it contributes to the ground-swell support of the resistance . Der Fiihrer 's Face wins the Disney studios 1942 's Academy Award for best animated short subject . It 's in the record books . Mrs. Miniver , with Greer Carson hiding in the cellar from the London Blitz , wins for best feature , and it 's not clear which is the more naturalistic presentation of this unthinkable war . Disney and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormously popular films become indispensable . In their own small way , the animators help win the war Over Here . But Walt , tireless overachiever , wonders if his effort has gone anywhere far enough . The daily papers show us pitched in an apocalyptic battle , Manichaean . Ultimate Good against ultimate Evil . For the first time , Disney considers just what we are up against . Cartoons may not be enough to win it . Even feature-length , big-budget , narrative animations  --  the art form Disney almost single-handedly invented  --  may be of only limited effectiveness in democracy 's arsenal . One night , as Disney strolls down Hollywood Boulevard 's blacked-out Walk of Fame , it comes to him : the studio , the country , the cause of freedom , need something more . Disney 's team must initiate a venture far beyond any yet undertaken , one that will motivate by words and pictures , appealing at once to heart and head . Disney must create a film falling  | both squarely in this world and far , far outside it , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bring home to the GI and the Rosie Riveters and the Joint Chiefs as well as the shiftless teenagers in suburban Jersey just where they are in Time , just how urgent , critical , real , and present the present is , just how central each of them is to the larger picture . Only one person in 1942 is capable of bringing moonlight into a chamber , of enchanting history , taming it , and leading it up the front stoop of America . That person is Disney . Like a V-1 going off inside his head , the title for this extraordinary venture comes to him : You Are the War . But that 's as far as he gets . For the first time in his creative life , inspiration fails him . He knows what the story must be , but he can not form the storyboard . Walt spends a restless , long night . The next morning , he convenes an emergency wartime meeting of the Disney brain trust . This is the band of geniuses who set tutued hippos dancing to Ponchielli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Music Hall had to reupholster all its dampened seats after Snow White 's record-breaking run . These are the artists who made Mickey 's exploits the most famous ongoing narrative of modern times . Disney strides into the boardroom where his crew sits . But before he can make his pitch and tell his creative henchmen about his brief glimmer , their need to find a way to reunite little and big , he notices something wrong . " Where are Tom and Ralph ? " he asks , irritated at being held up by the two empty spots . The rest of the board look down at the table top . They give no answer . Disney thinks for a minute that the truants might have been drafted , but all his personnel have been returned at Department of War insistence . lie would certainly know if they 'd enlisted . Disney has a fleeting vision , cartoon-style , of the two men suffering the long-feared first strike of Japanese aerial bombardment . And then : the Japanese . All at once the lather of the single-cel technique and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this here , suddenly understanding where Ralph Sato and Tom Ishi have disappeared to . The Chicken Little syndrome is not restricted to the enemy , the other side . You are the war . lie looks up , startled . Momentarily , around the table , his brain trust shimmers and dissolves into the animated characters that are the studio 's bread and butter . They segue into a cartoon tribunal , a jury of peers . To  | his right , Mickey folds his white kid-gloved hands pensively in front of him , Minnie taps her tail tip on the table . Smoke comes out of Donald 's ears . The dumb dawg Goofy just looks plain heartbroken . The scene fades and Disney once more finds himself looking at his idea people , in the same despondent postures . " Why are you looking at me ? " Disney shouts . " I did n't give the order . " Nobody accuses anybody , but Disney , feeling their palpable helplessness , gets up and storms out of the room . He goes straight to his office and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzzes . He does not come out that entire day , and he is still locked inside when the last of the staff leaves late that evening . His door is still closed when they come back the following day . A worried junior executive  --  a new hire whose task is simply to look after the boss and attend to his needs  --  puts his eye to the keyhole but sees nothing . He puts his ear to the door and hears a truly remarkable sound . Disney is there , all right . But speaking German . It might be nothing , but the aide realizes it might also be the war 's most nefarious act of defection since Quisling . His boss could be in that locked room with a wireless , relaying secret morale information to the Nazis . He can go to no one at the studio to relate his findings , as anyone might be in on the ring . Realizing without a second thought that his duty to country far outweighs any oath of fealty to employer , the aide goes straight to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two GIs proceed directly to Disney 's office and knock down the door . Disney looks up from behind his desk , for all the world the identical picture that had appeared in Fortune a few years before . He is talking into a black horned dictaphone , in the language of Goring and Goebbels . The soldiers confiscate the machine and take Disney under custody . Their CO listens to the tape . There is nothing on the machine except the same line , repeated over and over again a hundred times : gleich im Rucken der Planke , gleich dahinter , ists wirklich . Decent Americans , no one in the AA unit speaks a word of Kraut . Repeated over and over like this , the German phrase does take on the tone of a traitorous Mayday . Disney laughs , and asks to be escorted hack to his study . There , still under guard , he produces an en face edition of Rilke 's  | Duino Elegies . " But just in back of the billboard , just behind it , everything is real . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended meditations on such lines of poetry . Everybody has a good laugh . The soldiers apologize . Disney takes the aide out to dinner , rewards him for his unmeditated patriotism with some Series E bonds , and fires him . For he has had a remarkable idea while in his intensive seclusion . One of his best . He has had the first inklings of a way not only to produce You Are the War  --  the apotheosis of the art of live action and animation  --  but also to free his imprisoned men and as many other compatriots as he can bring out . It occurs to Disney during his bout with the dictaphone that victory at that price is no victory . If , after the war , in a world finally made free , he is praised as the maker of Der Fi hrer 's Face and Victory Through Air Power , it will count as nothing if he is also remembered as the private citizen who looked the other way at the crucial moment , who did not see his countrymen disappearing . Walt Disney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appointment with the secretary of war . He has an idea to run past Stimson , an idea on how to bring history into the American living room . An idea that will bring home , at least to one singing waiter , the war , the terrible urgency of the present , just behind the board . Bring it home forever .  |  | The next morning , Artie sat alone on the front porch , on his traditional chair next to the empty kapok bed , filling it in his mind . A handful of minutes after ten in the morning , the sun was so weak , the air so pastel , they compelled one to look after oneself . Artie did exactly that . He looked out on the lawn , at the once-startling oranges and ambers that had become chilled , drab brown in just hours . He thought , quietly and hidden , that something was about to happen , something important , the denouement of things long in the works . He felt that a secret , unexpected compartment in an old and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wondered how people could live with dim anticipations of life-shaking events and not be destroyed by them . But before he could get an answer , a voice from behind him interrupted his thoughts . " There 's more to any of us ... " Artie , unable to help himself , completed the tag to one of Dad 's favorite maxims , " Than any of us suspects . " But he did not turn around to face his father . He knew , coming out here to think , that eventually the man would follow . He had expected the aphorism ; he had already thought it to himself several times that morning without being aware of it . Ile did not know what the saying meant . Like the man and all his savings , it was always expected but never fully delivered . Dad slid into the horizontal on the bed in front of Artie , as if no time at all had passed since they had sat here two evenings before . Eddie Sr. had been doing his Sunday morning reading . He recited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the " I ) runken Saylor , " which he had just found in a dictionary of American folklore .  | Amidst the mists and coldest frosts , With barest wrists and stoutest boasts , He thrusts his fists against the posts And still insists he sees the ghosts . Father challenged son to a speed match . They tossed the twisty syllables back and forth until they fell . Artie could n't say the quatrain as fast as Dad , who had obviously practiced before dropping in.  | At Sunday lunch , Dad forced the family to agree to two conditions before he would be checked out by a legitimate physician . The first was that the hospital be Hines , the enormous Veterans Administration facility near Maywood in Chicago . " The Old Soldiers ' Home , " as Eddie Sr. fondly called it , was the only place he would surrender to without a fight . Dad 's two-year tour of duty toward the war 's end , although confined to the continental U.S. , qualified him for VA medical coverage . " I consider it ignominious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except one designed , built , and run by government agency , " he announced over sandwiches while no one listened . Truth was , after losing his latest teaching job he had no other insurance . Second , Pop stipulated that the family not commit him until after Thanksgiving . He insisted they spend the holiday at home , as usual . Before they made him check in , the family had to give him one last afternoon in downtown Chicago , to see the Christmas windows on State Street . Granted , the midwestern display never matched that of Fifth Avenue , on which Eddie had been raised , a working-class Jersey kid whipped into a frenzy by deeply imprinted four-part hymn tunes , intoxicated by the end-of-year stink of pine tar , wet woolies , and smoky paraffin , and thrilled by the ruinously expensive , ice-cold taxi ride over the George Washington Bridge at dawn . " I 'm not expecting much from Second City , but it 's No Go without Christmas windows . " If the holiday dioramas at Field 's and Carson 's were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those On The Avenue , if they were less successful in revealing , from out of the folds of mundane activity , that buried , ancient order of another time  --  the announcement , i miraculous birth just at our hour 's crisis , a globe of angels pouring  | from the sky to announce the news  --  if Chicago 's Christmas getup lacked magical transcendence , an afternoon in the Loop during the postThanksgiving shopping rush still offered a whiff of the ineffable . Just being downtown , taking in the miniature living displays , steeping in the annual imprint of capacitance-triggered frost-blue point lights synaptically blinker-linked to that passage , as familiar as breathing , beginning , " And it came to pass , " anticipating that brilliant tenor suspension against the three moving lines of the Glorias in " Angels We Have Heard On High , " might be enough to call up the old , street-wise gratias tibi , to shed mental habits as first virgin snow once again redeemed the city curb-soot that would soon deflower it . Pop talked of flying everybody to New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , even if he had been working . Practical impediment had not stopped his chattering about the pipe dream , however . Lily had . As he carried on about the superiority of Fifth Avenue 's windows to those of State Street , Lily simply reminded him of the story he had often told them of how his mother , with her very last breath , lamented that the art of making the ice cream she had enjoyed as a girl had been forever lost . Lily repeated , with perverse enjoyment , Pop 's own conclusion . " It was n't the flavor , but Grandma 's taste buds that were buried in time . " Dad smiled wanly at being brought into line . Swearing he would not go to his end ignobly , he said State Street would do for his last outing at liberty . Thus constrained , Dad 's momentous concession to medical science meant that life on the home front , until after Thanksgiving , would remain Illness As Usual . None of the five ancillary Hobsons cared for these two conditions , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barrel . They could play on his terms or not at all . For her part , Lily did not protest the imposed delay . She had long ago saturated her heart with the boom-and-bust cycle of hope she foolishly held for her father 's perpetual battle with phantoms . She met Pop 's promise to undergo tests with a pretense of cynical pessimism , one that would allow her to keep the next few weeks on a fairly even keel . But after the meal broke up , she hid out with a calendar and counted the days . Rach shrugged at the announcement and its conditions . After lunch , she sneaked up on the fat man as he reclined on his trademark kapok mattress  | on the now-freezing front porch and put him in a headlock . She threatened , " Ok , buddski . You get any thoughts a backin ' outta dis , and weese pincha you earlobes off . " Eddie Jr. , hearing Pop 's invented postponements , breathed deeply , swallowed hard , and then " shook it off , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He promptly spent the afternoon exchanging sports scores over the telephone with a dozen friends . Artie , skeptical , still intent on a diagnosis , alarmed himself and aggravated the situation unduly by discovering that Dad showed a " positive Romberg 's sign , " meaning the man collapsed spontaneously when asked to stand , look straight forward , and close both eyes . How long the condition had existed or just what if anything it meant neither Artie nor anyone else in the family had the slightest idea . Ailene , who after her first breakthrough had thought he would be in the hospital and partly cured by the following week , was quietly decimated by her husband 's delays . But she agreed to them without outward sign . That evening before departure , Rachel made the family rounds , smacking everybody good-bye . " Back to the old nosebleed , " she said , as always at the end of a visit , alluding to her upper-altitude office in the Standard Oil building on the Lakeshore . She was about to pull the same joke on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face . Rach sobered and , in the tone reserved for private times between the two , said , " It goes without saying . . . " Unable to complete the sentence without contradiction , she laughed . " I 'll be back in , at least for T-Day , Mrs. I 've got the full four days then . " Anything else would be brutal , pointless , or untrue , so Rach consoled her mother with actuarial figures on hospital recoveries and hit her up for a favorite Christmas cookie recipe . Artie spent the evening convincing himself that he could not hang around any longer either . He , on the other hand , did not make the long rounds of good-bye . Instead , he waited until the last moment and then asked Rach for a lift back . " If I leave with you tonight , I wo n't have to deal with The Dog . Bus exhaust always nauseates me . " Rach checked the bottom of his shoes and only then cleared him for boarding . To kill the minutes before departure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chucking the pigskin . " I ca n't believe you 're leaving , " Eddie  | said , good-naturedly . Artie knew his brother meant the line as a harmless rib . But the insinuation so infuriated him that , overcompensating , he underthrew his brother 's perfect buttonhook . " School , Eddie-boy . " He squeezed his vocal cords into joviality . " Got to pass de of Bar X-am so I 'll be able to get you off all those DWIs you will doubtless rack up . " His brother returned a weak smile , as technically convincing as a film performance by one of those countless , interchangeable jocks-turned-celluloid stars . Artie 's anger , which he had for days managed to spread in a thin residue over the neighborhood , reversed directions and concentrated until he could appease it only with a preemptive strike against Eddie ; either Eddie . Artie was sorry that he had attempted to leave the boy an escape through affected cheer . " What the hell do you expect ? " he asked , keeping his voice hidden below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any longer I 'll flunk out . What would I accomplish by staying here ? What do you propose I do ? Help you drag him up to bed every night ? " Working this outlash to the surface , Artie felt his fury just as suddenly shut off like an overheated thermostat . He saw a delicious irony in his inability to raise anything more than a politely underplayed anger . After all , he , of all the children , had been the only dish breaker as a kid . Little Eddie , feeling how close they were to a full-scale blowout , fell into his patented strategy for undoing the tension he had inadvertently made . " I ca n't believe you 're leaving . " He subscribed to the principle that if you said something often enough , you would eventually make the accidentally injured party laugh . " I ca n't . . . I ca-ca ... I just ca n't believe . . . You ca n't be . . . " All punches walk in a single line . It always worked for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , and part of him thawed . After a dozen drunken Eddie-iterations of the offending phrase , the boys exchanged wry looks : no need for escalations here . Artie backed down from his docket . He ran looser , flicked with a little more flair . But just as Artie started to enjoy himself , the surprise prowess of his body , and the bite of the air , a sharp spiral bullet pass from Eddie caught him on the jaw and took a chunk out of his face . The pass came in so treacherously that Artie did n't even have time to put up his hands . He crumpled to the grass , the freezing ground . Eddie ran over to him , streaming , " Sorry . Oh Jesus , I 'm sorry , it was an accident , sorry , accident , acci . . " At the  | same time , Artie objected furiously , " No , no . It 's nothing . My fault . I was n't paying .. . I was having too good a ... " Eddie brought Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Artie , peaceful now that he had earned his Purple Heart , chose the nursing moment to deliver up his belated birthday present to Eddie . Eddie Jr . ' s eighteenth , the ostensible reason they had gathered here for the weekend , had been all but forgotten , upstaged by the Invalid 's latest and greatest return from remission . Artie went to the bottom of his bureau and brought forth the peace offering . Little Eddie recognized his brother 's gift at once , something he had for years coveted : a set of World War II photographs of enemy warplanes replete with performance statistics and markings , still packed in the army-issue box stamped " Secret " that Eddie Sr. had received in the service . Pop had passed the photos on to his firstborn , with solemn instructions to learn the silhouettes by heart . " The WEFT method : Wings , Engine , Fuselage , Tail . Every man must do his part , " the man had said , giving it the same intonation as he always gave to " There 's more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Sea will provide . " " Oh , Artie . You do n't have to . Maybe you want to hold on to these , incase .. Artie overrode Eddie 's protests and objections of unworthiness . " Take them . You 've wanted them for years . I 've memorized them long ago . Just do n't tell Dad that I 'm reneging on surveillance duty , okay ? " He had enclosed a card , which Eddie now read : " Congrats on surviving Basic . Never thought you 'd make it this far . " A brotherly allusion to " Chain of Command , " the game Dad had always used to get them to make their beds , take baths , practice musical instruments , do homework , and stay in line . Eddie was the Buck Private , Artie the Sergeant , and Pop the General , liable to make surprise spot inspections at any time . When the boys complained , asking when they would be able to get out of boot camp , Pop always responded , " You do n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift , Eddie Jr . understood , was his t ) rom otional papers , from Artie to the next in command . Before the visit broke up , Lily surprised everyone by dragging out the camera that had been hanging in the hack of her closet , filmless , for the last few years . She documented Rachel and Artie 's departure , a photo opportunity unremarkable the extreme . In this way , she maintained  | the longstanding Hobson family-snapshot tradition of feast or famine . Their photo album alternated between drought and glut . They would add no new pictures for years . Then someone would shoot a dozen exposures of five people hanging around the front door , giving a misleading significance to a moment whose importance , if any , was soon forgotten . Such was the present : four photographs of a confused group milling around the front door . " Well , " Ailene said , summing up everyone 's feelings . She could think of nothing more appropriate to say , and left it at that . " Welp , " agreed Rachel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that right . You . . . sure . . . got that right . " Eddie Jr . giggled . Provoked into hilarity , he reached out a hand as if to shake Arthur 's good-bye , but instead kept going and rammed him in the solar plexus . Suddenly , Lily could n't stand the false festivities another second . She put her hands to her ears and beat a retreat to her room . There she reshelved the camera and put a forgotten vocal group from the sixties on the grinder , blotting out the noises from the outside . Eddie Sr. , however , was in rare form . Filling the silence created by Lily 's quick exit , he stood in the doorway and told , by way of a send-off , about a recent article he 'd come across : a marvelous gorilla who had been taught to speak sign language . " Most attempts at animal communication , " Dad explained , " on examination , rely on cuing and conditioning . But what sets this guy apart is that he 's been filmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Artie , Rach , Ailene , and little Eddie , unable to connect Pop 's monologue with the situation yet certain of a link , however Byzantine , looked on in horrified fascination , not daring to stop him or anticipate what topic he would jump to next . Seeing he had garnered a modest success with the ape , Dad turned his attention to the angels . " You might also be interested to hear that engineers at Hughes Research Lab have succeeded in answering a timeless metaphysical question by microengraving one hundred thousand gold-deposit angels on the head of a pin . Unfortunately , the pin subsequently squirted out of the technician 's tweezers and is now lost forever in a crack in the laboratory floor . " And he began to free-associate completely , launching into a Robert Service travesty , The Pin on the Laboratory Floor . " Ile would eventually have found a way around to kipling 's " If , " had  | Rachel not blurted out , " Hey , hey , hey . Wait justa , will ya ? Have n't we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " She dug the ever-present pitch pipe out of her coat pocket , tooted it , and began singing the crystalline soprano strain , " Lo , how a rose e'er blooming ... " To hear the full four-part treatment was , after all , one of her chief incentives for coming home this weekend . Now she was determined to collect the pleasure , even in the closing minutes of the trip . The others did n't make it in on the down beat , but three of four parts made the glorious hemiola at the end of the first strain . By the end of the second , even Lily had derailed her record player and crept shyly back out of her room to double her mother on alto . The boys , tenors true , doubled the other interior line , while Eddie Sr. supported the beefy bass part with so precise and clear an intonation that his kids once again felt he might have made a career out of singing-waiterdom , now atrophied . Pop 's musical ear left only the legendary Miller Tiller as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melodies instead of teaching , more than one of them now thought , everything might have turned out differently . Whatever the truth in that , by verse two Rach had her full chorale . The passing harmonies confirmed her belief that , if one avoided their attendant misery , no folks more deserved her love than these . This fact welled up in her ears as they glided into that deceptive modulation just before the last cadence without anyone either accidentally repeating the dominant or giving away the transcendence by telegraphing the surprise chord . All at once , the flash that each had tried so hard to evade was there , intact : a moment of tender visiting hovering over them as the tenors slid down that narrow half-step to the F sharp . They all felt it , momentarily . And each knew the others received a momentary hold on the instant , too . All six stood looking into a place before irony , before wit , before anxiety , before evasion . Surfaces dispersed , and in the still point underneath , they saw what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long gainsaying : how hopelessly each cared what happened to the other . The care shouted out uninvited between them , like a candidate 's criminal record . They had no choice but to tune their chord to it . They stood startled , flushed into that snare , aware for once of the connection between them that could reach down at leisure and destroy them . Caught in glorious chord , in facts gathered from each other 's faces , they all felt  | the fissure  --  fragile , dangerous , and beautiful  --  close up and leave them in the incurable call back to tonic . The rose I have in mind . The tune stopped , and so did the room . When the spell broke , they again exchanged counterpoint good-byes all around . Parents and children traded the pointed , pointless trivialities of leave-taking : " Drive carefully . Do n't kill yourself . " " Okay , Ma , we wo n't . " Once more , fainter , briefer this time , a trace of the first visit came back : this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into Hobsonspeak . Everything spoken stood for something else , with one exception . For when Dad grabbed Artie 's hand with his own insistent grip , he raised his eyebrows in a new intellectual challenge . Rather than echo anything so trivial as " Take care , " he said , " Dr. Harold Wolff , of Cornell . " The remark startled Artie , coming without context or gloss . He had n't a clue to what Dad meant . But Artie had cut his teeth on just such ellipses . With Dad , the out-of-context challenge was standard fare , meat and potatoes . " What field is he in ? " Artie called back , thinking on his feet , as Rach dragged him out the door . But Dad just lifted his brows again , shrugged , and waved , already fading back into the well-wishing crowd . Artie and Rachel boarded Mr. Nader , a Ford Pinto complete with exploding gas tank , which she had chosen for perversely unactuarial reasons , and tooled down Second Street . Slowly , there descended on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simile . The homebound four reconnoitered at the door one full measure longer than required . Then the ranks broke into a rout . Late that night , Eddie Jr. , looking for Dad in all the shamelessly optimistic places , saving the only likely one for last , found him racked out on the porch , stretched on the kapok , not sleeping yet but fortunately not tranced-out either . " Damn it , Pop . What the hell are you doing out here ? It 's witch-titty cold out . Or did n't you notice ? " " Is that any way to talk to your father ? Did I raise you to be a potty mouth ? That 's witch-breasty cold , boy . " Eddie Jr . threw a blanket over his father and dropped into the side chair , filling in for the departed Artie . He thought , with only a little remorse , of what a relief it would be for Pop to kick off right now , die of something unexpected , say , exposure or pneumonia . Yet Little Eddie  | found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dad 's comic curiosity in the face of everything struck Eddie as the only form of dignity possible these days . But as the look of familiar whimsy shaded his dad 's face , it seemed , in the shadows , to tip toward vicious . Perhaps Artie was right : Dad 's good nature was not good-natured , his bluff not just bluff . Eddie looked again at Dad 's face , but could not longer see anything in the diminished streetlamp glow . He thought how he was now eighteen and would have to start being more discriminating . He picked up both of Dad 's discarded socks  --  the man was trying to get pneumonia  --  and juggled them along with a pewter ashtray , exercising the athletic grace that he alone of all Hobsons commanded . The three unbalanced objects stayed aloft best when he focused not on them but on the scar on his father 's exposed ankle , a wartime wound marking where part of a B-17 fuselage had pinned Dadimo to a dolly . " Fire with fire , " Eddie Jr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As ye give , so shall ye get . And verse-vica , you scratch my back , I 'll scratch yours . " He might have been falling benignly into randomness . But Dad needed no grace notes for explanation . He answered his son without missing a beat . " Interesting position . But it wo n't get you out . You mean each prisoner should retaliate with what the other guy does the turn before ? Is that right ? " Eddie Jr. , implementing the policy for himself , said nothing , juggling in the dark . Dad continued . " Tit for Tat . God knows it 's an honorable attempt at stabilizing . In fact , it 's the strategy of choice in the best textbooks . And it 's the option with the greatest chance of success with prisoners who are simple and good enough to assume the other guy is also simple and good . " Here Dad gave Eddie Jr . a look that could , in the dark , pass for heartbroken fondness . The quick , covert glance betrayed Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom the world would soon methodically dismantle . The look said : I care for you most because you do n't know what you 're up against . Eddie Jr. , eyes on his orbits , did not notice . " But practically speaking , " Dad continued , " the policy collapses in at least two cases . "  | One sock circumnavigated the juggled loop , followed by the pewter , to_the ( ? n the other sock . The smooth motion was Eddie Jr . ' s nod to continue . " At first thought , cooperating with cooperation and betraying betrayal seems to stabilize the situation and stick it to old Senator Joe . But this strategy requires that the dilemma occur not just once , but repeatedly . It does n't help the one-shot event at all ; you need retrials to make your policy known to the other guy . Retaliation wo n't enforce anything if there 's no tomorrow . That 's breakdown number one . " Eddie Jr . bobbled the pewter , but kept on . So did Dad . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points every Monday night . It 's the same bind as the McCarthy model , only it happens regularly . Mutual cooperation is still better than mutual back-stabbing , but there 's still a premium paid for being the only one to rat . Now we can test your Tit for Tat . You both play fair for a few weeks . Then , the other guy tries the rewarding double cross . You pay him back the next week with a taste of his own medicine . If he cooperates , you reward him in spades . What we used to call the Old Testament law . As soon as the pattern reveals itself , it should be clear that nobody 's going to get away with anything much . The game has been greatly simplified . He knows you 'll seek retribution if he tries anything . And you 're both lulled into a false security . " False , because one Monday night , there 's an accident . He 's late with the delivery . You think he 's defected . You pay him back the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays Tit for Tat in week three , and you fall into a game of perpetual revenge . " Outside , cars scythed up and down Second Street . Houses lined the cut , preparing private glows as an Arctic air mass rolled in from Canada . " Besides , " Dad added , " any week might be the last . So there 's always that additional incentive to take a chance , rat , and cash in . " Dad looked at the boy with real concern , wishing to keep him from harm . But he set his jaw and kept on , intent on disabusing him , hurting him , if need be , to keep him from greater injury . " There 's an even bigger problem . True . In a world of independent vested interests , you need some threat to prevent the other guy from threatening you . But please tell me what threat is big enough to check the force we are really up against ? PREZ SEZ HE WILL NOT BLINK FIRST . How do you retaliate against something that size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s air-bound socks caught on the tip of the pewter ashtray . The unstable amalgam flew out of orbit , and the kid was left  | pumping his hands in empty air . He put his hands in his lap . After a proprietary pause telling Dad that the diatribe had not gone undigested , he smiled and repeated , simply , " Fire with fire . With a little space for forgiveness . " Dad propped himself up on one arm , an action requiring visible sacrifice and agony . He leaned over to little Eddie , all pedagogy wiped from his face . A rippling irritation softened and broke over him from north of the diaphragm . He put his chin to his clavicle . Perhaps the convulsion was just gas spasms ; perhaps it was part of the larger disease . Or perhaps Dad was the victim of a different , unmanageable concern , something the prisoner matrix , the threat of retaliation , kept him from saying outright . Perhaps Dad knew the feeling that had him by the throat but , for the boy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only have been love : he could not have helped but love anyone capable of such irrational kindness . He had to love anyone of his blood who was the equal of keeping to that shameless ideal . And what he felt for Little Eddie Dad admitted only indirectly , saying , " Good man , " punctuating the confession with a nervous , under-the-breath swallow . But his implication was lost on the boy when a pair of headlights swung into the drive . The two Eddies froze in their separate tracks and turned toward the beam , caught criminals , or animals dazed in the pool of light . Mere interrogation turns innocent actions into complicity , thought Ed Jr. , a mnemonic for something he had forgotten , probably from a quiz session in Artie 's law books . He recalled the one that went , " On Old Olympus 's Towering Top , a Fat-Assed German Viewed a Hawk , " a mnemonic for the eight cranial nerves . Artie taught him that one , too , and he was grateful . He 'd completely forgotten the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory-jogging device as if it were itself the catechism . The same with Mere Interrogation , as the beam in the driveway caught father and son holding the bag . " Got ta head , Pop . That 's my ride . " Eddie Jr . stood , spun , and flipped a twenty-foot jumper with the remaining sock , which came down gently over the war wound on Dad 's shin . With one smooth motion Eddie lifted a coat off the rack near the door and fell into the front yard . He was almost to the waiting car full of friends when his father called him back once inure . Eddie Jr. , protesting , returned , compelled by something in the old bellow , the old " Sea will provide " chantey.  | " Where you off to , little man ? " " Oh ... just out . Friends from school . You know us kids , Pop . It 's always something . Hormones . " " Should I wait up ? " asked Dad , tasting the irony , a pernicious smile at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest . Do n't you worry about that . You 're not getting away with nothing . " Eddie turned again to the car , toward society and mutual support . But once more , perhaps for the last time , Pop called him back , this time with a whisper . Eddie Jr . came back , obedient but complaining . He stopped , shocked , when the beam of the headlights caught his father 's red-rimmed and swollen eyes . All the while they had been sitting here , shooting the abstract shit , sardonically debating one another , Pop had been crying . " Son , I happened to read , only this morning , that native North Americans broke the necks of their dying . "  | C My father spoke to us only in favorite sayings , a stable of workhorses saddled up to fit any occasion . The common ones are still with me , as familiar as the alphabet . We could never be sure just what fresh derangement he might squeeze out of the overused maxims , what foreign situation he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its opposite . All we knew in advance was that whenever the world threatened to do us in , whenever we most needed him to assure us that life could still be reinvented , he would instead resort to one favorite saying or another . For the longest time , I assumed that all fathers did . After all , as everybody knew , all Indians walked in single file . I now know that he thought such familiarities would be more useful to us in the long run than mere care . Looking back , I see how he wanted us to love his mysterious homilies the way he loved them . He meant them to substitute for him , the distant fellow lost in an abstraction . But we could n't and they did n't . Not at the time . I did not even understand what they meant , what the man was all along announcing , or what he was up against until after he was dead . My father 's real imprisonment hid in those single-file Indians , in " There 's more to any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . Alongside those two , he favored " Take all that you want , but eat all that you take , " a metaphor , by turns , for the need for foresight , the indivisibility of means and ends , and the impossibility of true satisfaction . Then there was the paradoxical " We sometimes need coaxing to act on our own . " Whenever he resorted to this one , I would throw back " Tell us how free we are , Pop . Tell me how free I am. " 1 he phrase of his that most haunted me when I was young , that seemed flu ' most beautiful and inscrutable , that came closest to pulling me beyond thin barricade into the cell where he wasted away , was " If you bail out the  | tide with a twopenny pail , then you and the moon can remove a great deal . " As mysterious and poetic as the ubiquitous couplet was , I never once guessed until the repetitions ended that Pop 's enemy was necessity , and what , if anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall his most urgent one : I would break an anniversary vase , or my sister would despair over headlines , or our mother would go to pieces at the old man 's latest raging fever , and he would say , from his half-coma , " Suppose the world were already lost . " Suppose it is , because it is . I never took this advice , I never bothered to suppose while he was still living , because I always thought he used this most crucial of all his phrases as a way to evade the camp of conscience we are all thrown into . Just the opposite . " Suppose the world were already lost . " Somehow Dad understood that forsaking everything was the only chance we had of saving what we cared for . But the aphorism that blew the man open for me , the phrase that gave me a foot into the barred gate , burned into my memory through Pop 's thousand reiterations , was " Fate is the stuff we stick in the time capsule . " His favorite variant was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While he lived , saying it every chance he got , all the line ever did was annoy me . But when , days after he left for good , I heard him repeat it one last time , I finally understood that he had been begging history 's pardon . God knows , he 'd given us his capsule 's inventory often enough . I still hear him tell the whole family , assembled at dinner , how in the spring of 1944 , a shopgirl in Saddle River Township , New Jersey , had her first look at history . He described her periodic sweep past the drugstore 's magazine racks , doing her bit , in the words of the trade , to reduce shrinkage , waging hopeless war against deterioration of store stock , preserving margin from shopkeepers ' plagues . He had seen her countless times , on untouched afternoons , patrolling the magazine section to chase away those starstruck , fact-starved , and surreptitious browsers who even today , when current events can be had for free , sneak all the news that fits into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shopgirl found , according to Dad 's version , two half-pints who pealed out of the store at her approach and a debutante who , caught red-handed in a brief fantasy of discovery in a soda shoppe in Southern Cal , guiltily slid closed the book of Life and moved on to Cosmetics . But in addition to these three regulars , she came across  | something she had not bargained for : a boy-man , just old enough for the service , looking over a weekly picture magazine and weeping . I can no more imagine my father crying than I can imagine how saving toothpaste tubes could defeat the Nazis . But the boy with the picture magazine was my father , the same man who had to assume the world was lost to love it . My mistake , repeated each time my father told the story , was never connecting the two . The shopgirl had a similar problem . Not knowing how else to respond , and washed in guilt as if she were the cause of the crisis , she offered , " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not okay , either with Management or with the diminutive Mister she meant to comfort . Choked speechless , the boy showed her , by explanation , the magazine he illegally browsed . She looked obediently , but could not make out which of the stories on the proffered page caused him to break down . I have since looked up a copy of the same magazine spread . I can see her eliminating the pictorial on a nationwide scrap-rubber drive as devoid of intrinsic emotion . Similarly , a brief photo-biography of a one-armed major-league ballplayer , although fascinating , lacked the necessary pathos to reduce even a fan to tears . Down on the lower left of page 17 , a detailed account of the immense jump in the cost of living , while disturbing , could not have brought on such anguish . Process of elimination left only one picture on the two-page spread that could account for the fellow 's public sorrow . She studied the holdout , a two-inch-by-two-inch grainy black-and-white snapshot of the body of a young Army Air Corps pilot being removed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She quizzed the boy with compassion , seeing his face for the first time . It crossed her mind to tell him that , although against the rules , he could browse as long as he liked . A miniature oral seizure told her he was trying to say something . She listened , leaning closer , and thought she made out the phrase " My brother . " My uncle . I imagine she fought off an urge to touch his arm ; not wanting to intrude on his grief even to look at him , she glanced back down at the glossy page . And then something happened to her that she doubtless regretted daily for all of the thirty-odd years that followed . She lost her presence of mind and , at the urging of the weekly news magazine , whose home-front /unction was to turn disaster into something bearable and diverting ,  | asked , " Is it really your brother ? He 's really dead , then ? " With a horrible noise , half sob and all laugh , an inhuman sound that both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy turned from the magazine rack and was gone . I can trace this Jersey shopgirl , call her Sarah , easier than I can follow what happened to my father . She grew , acquired a college degree , married , had four children , and retired somewhere outside Orlando , Florida . Yet throughout the course of her long and varied life , concealing this incident from those nearest her , never speaking of it over dinner , she could not understand how she could love some perfect stranger more than her successful husband and flawless children , how she could care for someone she did n't even know , someone she had met for all of three minutes , someone already lost , how she could still remember , daily , down in the suburbs outside Orlando , her once having stumbled across a boy-man who broke all the rules and openly cried his loss , despite the magazine rack being clearly posted NO BROWSING . About Sarah , I speculate . The boy 's story I have firsthand . A few months later , graduating from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualifying birthday in a bedroll outside his neighborhood selectiveservice office . Dad passed the medical and psych exams without incident . But he came up short , or rather too tall by inches , to make his intended field of service . At six foot one , he was just over the maximum height for both his first choice , pilot , and second choice , gunner . His board laughed good-naturedly , and told him to swallow his bad luck . " Shake it off , " they supposedly said , although the words sound more like his than theirs . " Some guys has got fallen arches , some 's too tall . The war 's winding up anyway . Pop 's ensuing comic monologue , in which he claimed that he was really very short for his height and swore that he would stoop and wear shoulder weights for the duration , left the draft-board officers unwilling to bend the rules in this instance . They asked him why he was so hot to fly , and he told them the familiar motive , the solution even heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Revenge . They had more than enough applicants for the combat flight positions , and with the war in its transitional stage , the time needed to train greenhorns for such demanding jobs was prohibitive . But seeing that this kid was more than usually desperate to contribute to the fly-boys ' war ,  | they offered him a bit part as an airplane and engine mechanic . I have the papers spread in front of me : Job Spec 747 . Within the year , they guaranteed , he 'd never want to see a plane again , inside or out . Thus Pop discovered that practical history had no salve left in it for the local soul . For that , the griever must make another place . He spent two and a half months in Air Corps Basic , Job Spec 521 , thirteen weeks in Amarillo Mechanics School , and an additional six weeks in Transition Airplane and Engine Mechanics , learning how to " Examine portions of aircraft such as wings , fuselage , stabilizers , flight control surfaces , propeller and landing gear for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate maintenance . " He worked mainly on B-29 Superfortresses , a plane he often described to us with clinical interest . " What did you do in the War , you ask ? " he would answer , although we never asked . He 'd get that wry , dry , sardonic smile , and say , " Prophylactic surgery . " But even preventing a thousand Brownsvilles could not undo this one . I suppose that was why Dad rapidly won a reputation for being the guy you could always ( " had to " sounds closer to the truth ) send in for the potentially dangerous scut work  --  the jammed bomb payloads , the inflammable fuel ruptures . Dad always described his tour of duty as a Johnny-come-lately 's domestic Bataan Death March . As the war rolled into its final months and enemy resistance collapsed without his lifting a weapon , Pop and his paperwork moved from Stateside air base to air base , throughout the South and Southwest , rolling up the increasingly obsolete runways . He joked to us ad nauseum that whenever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called him in . On the strength of this sterling service record and mocking his notorious love of photoplay , his buddies called him the Leo ( : orcey of airplane mechanics , the seventh Dead End Kid . Flight mechanics kept him too busy to consider the hopelessness of his situation . I imagine Dad longed for civilian life , not for ordinary reasons but for the chance to suffer something , make some sacrifice , help pay for Victory out of his own pocket , if only indirectly , by toughing out the hundred national rationings and shortages  --  rubber , shoes , or gas . But R and R worsened the condition . He asked that his leave be cut ; the higher-ups told him special arrangements could n't be swung . If they let him have less leave , others would want to take up the slack . And yet , for reasons reason understood , he hated more than anything to return to Jersey  | for a weekend , where in the front window of my grandparents ' railroad apartment hung that indicting chunk of star-shaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , I feel him sliced down the middle with Sunday 's pork roast , seared by his parents ' casual words , trapped by the epochal events he could get no closer to than his safe place under the fuselage , resting on his brother 's laurels . On one such unwanted home leave , while suffering through a particularly lightweight matinee of Busby Berkeleyesque fluff in which two hundred blond , curvaceous hoofers tapped out the logical necessity of the current geopolitical situation in a brilliant piece of choreography involving spiked heels that discharged low-caliber weapons at Hitler silhouettes when kicked out to the proper angle , Dad , in an early exit to the lobby , collided with my mother . The escapist cineadventure horrified him because he alone of the Allied War Effort did not want to escape from stresses so much as he wanted to escape into them . But by both accounts , when their eyes met , she over jujubes and he over a Lucky Strike Red  --  because " Lucky Strike Green has gone to war " ? they re-created a life-sized enactment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady in the first reel . Silently , without introductions , they accompanied each other out to the street and into the sunshine . They used to re-create the dialogue that followed , playing it for us in tandem . Sometimes they disagreed slightly over a minor turn of phrase . But overall , they agreed remarkably . Over the years they hammered out a compromise of what had transpired in their first conversation . Both loved to playact their courtship for us . This touring repertoire was the only public romance they ever performed . Fate is what you put in the time capsule . Here is how we got there . They exchanged names and thumbnail biographies . Mom confessed that she had n't cared for the film either . She explained to him as they walked that she ordinarily worked days , for a company that put the homo in homo milk . She had only gone to the afternoon show because her boss , although not a dentist , nevertheless weighing in very close to one by wearing a white smock all day long , had threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did n't take the afternoon off " He thinks 1 work too hard , " she explained shyly . " Do n't have that problem with my current employer , " Eddie joked ,  | indicating the uniform . " But they make me take the vacation anyway . " Something in their body odors smelled of mutual sacrifice , and they found themselves linking fingers almost without thinking . Mother would do it again , years later , stroking Dad 's knuckles in remembered protection . After another silence , he raised their knotted hands to his face , kissed the back of her wrist , and smiled with the resigned sadness and gratitude of one finishing the last chapter of a book . I re-create that smile on his face , a police artist 's composite . They walked side by side along a row of shops , looking , pointing , swinging hands , but not saying much . Finally Dad , looking away from this unknown woman , said , " That movie ... " alluding to the escapist morale musical they had just escaped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bizarre and untenable equation the film itself had just tried to make . " I lost a brother to that war . " An act of courage just to say it , let alone repeat it for years . His voice filled with horror at anyone trying to film the incomprehensible present with song and dance . His wife-to-be bowed her head and looked away herself . She said something , an " I did too " that carried away on the wind down an east/west cross street , taking a forty-year detour . After some blocks , he drew near her and asked , " Does this tune mean anything to you ? " He whistled a few bars of " Moonlight Serenade . " She nodded , swiftly and succinctly , a glow filling her eyes . She squeezed his hand , and he squeezed back . Then he asked " How about this one ? " And he began " A Mighty Fortress . " Mother looked down at the sidewalk and nodded more slowly . " Yes , but I 've never heard it whistled before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest , that they both suddenly broke out laughing at the sound . Their laughter took them , like falling , the most natural movement in the world , into each other 's arms for that promissory kiss everyone can make only once in life without perjury . They drew apart , laughter quieted , needing further assurance . They were still joined at the hands . They walked for blocks , through residential neighborhoods , retail strips , warehouses , empty lots . They looked in the windows of every structure they passed , exercising the eminent domain of those marginally happier than the median . After twenty minutes , Dad at last asked , " Well , what about children , then ? "  | And my mother , in the most quietly assured voice she would ever muster for him , answered , " Oh , the more the better , of course . A dozen . " The PFC clapped his hands and opened his throat . " Yes ! A dozen . A baker 's dozen . " Then he fell circumspect . A minute later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only sure form of protection , you know . " He could not have meant us . The next day , Sunday , the libraries and civic offices were closed . By eleven A.M. Monday , however , my father had all the institutional cross-references about the stranger that he needed . He appeared cap in hand at her place of employ and asked her out to lunch . How he 'd gotten her work address he never revealed and she never discovered . Over deli cuts and funny stories about the service , he popped the question . Years later , he told us that he never had any anxieties about her refusing . And on account of the uniform , his high cheekbones , her general commitment to national duty , or some deep disaffection with social mores , she did not disappoint him . She cabled back to Oak Hill River Park Forest Grove , more to impart information than to seek her folks ' approval . Days later , the two children edged into the office of the justice of the peace and signed the pact just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the Army Air Corps ' shop . It was , they both agreed later , a regulation wartime wedding . When she found out how her husband-to-be had spent Monday morning , Mom took a deep and lasting offense . She could not decide which pained her more : her future husband taking it on himself to research her , or his being too hurried to do as comprehensive a job on her as on all the previous candidates . She passed the test after only one morning of record-digging , calling into question the thoroughness of his job . She never dropped word of it to any of us , not even to that unacknowledged child who was her secret favorite . Over the years she listened smilingly as Dad told her children how he had looked up her files and passed her in rigorous inspection . She helped him reenact the whirlwind courtship over our faked protests of indifference . But I 'm sure it ruined her , although she never said the first word . There was more to our mother than any of us suspected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's extended self-excision walked clearly across her face like schoolchildren behind a crossing guard  | She had thought , wrongly , that their afternoon walk was itself the audition , not needing the proof of public papers . She had believed , naively , that he had no need to double-check . It had seemed to her that for a few hours , they two alone of everyone on earth had experienced simple trust and mutual goodwill . She had imagined them holding back the tide of 1944 between them , unassisted , with a twopenny pail . But he reminded her , cruelly and daily , just by turning into the man he did , that nothing came to pass without the aid of the complicitous moon . Dad , too , felt the scars of their courtship . Not its bluntness or brevity , but something altogether different . Failing to break himself of his fondness for movies , it irked him that they had met at the cinema , at a morale booster that had insulted them both as well as the memories of their spent brothers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon escaping the horror of the world conflagration , hiding inside the confines of a darkened theater . They had tried to lose their own survivors ' guilt in an afternoon of Ruritania or Shangri-La . They had been no better than the thousands of gold-star mothers who weekly tried to win back their own murdered children through blissful oblivion at Judge Hardy 's . It convinced him of a permanent flaw , both in their marriage and in the capacity of the human mind to recover from annihilation too easily , that while they had found no consolation in the two-hour world , they had discovered one another in a motion-picture lobby . Much later my father discovered the value of escapism in standing ground against the real . By that time , most of the censuring gold-star mothers were dead themselves . Their losses , debits carried over in public accounting , had been posted so long ago that they were struck from the active book , transferred to the dead ledger . Those who remained , when they thought of the war years at all , remembered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did Dieppe . Tara stands out , sharper than Tora . We revive , rebuild , resew our wardrobe like the feisty little Brit girl making that green dress from the draperies . The Blitz becomes its fictional victim , Mrs. Miniver , trapped in a b nnb shelter , reading Alice in Wonderland to the kids . Whatever the long-term consequences , we preserve " Night and Day " over " Night and Fog . " And even the casualties themselves would n't have it any other way . Besides , as Dad himself learned firsthand in the months immediately  | following his own overnight , cinematic marriage , most of the history we can ever hope to get comes in newsreels . And movies could conspire toward worse things than escape . In a world already lost , we must sometimes pack our keepsakes , keep our heads down , and create a magic kingdom of maxims . My father has disappeared into one , leaving me here . Sometimes we need coaxing to act on our own .  | " I 've got a great idea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Pinto deathtrap . She and Artie tooled their way east on Route 5 back to Chicago , still on the forsaken side of Aurora . They had forty minutes of late evening left , not enough to get them home . " Why do n't you reach over with your left foot and control the accelerator . Then I should be able to handle everything else pretty easily . " " I 've got a better idea , " Artie answered drily . " Why do n't you just drive like everybody else and get me back to Hyde Park without killing me. ' 1'lren I 'll give you a little brotherly peck on the cheek as a reward . " " Jeez Louise . Or as the Espanich say , Heezoo Flooizoo . What 's happened to you , buddy ? You 're just no fun anymore . Know that ? Absolutely no fun . " Artie smiled beatifically and nestled deeper into Mr. Nader 's passenger seat . His sister continued to berate him in a variety of dialects and portmanteaus . Listening to her was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing what was going on . Rachel alone had the capacity to turn the East-West Tollway into something more than the world 's most expensive , desolate , opaque , and eventless tour from nowhere to nowhere through nowhere . Artie 's job , on the other hand , in his self-appointed role as acrid older brother , was to provide , less out of dear for his own safety than from a private need for symmetry , a counterweight to her idiocy. t home , he never hesitated to add his own modest humor to the tnn , away routine . But alone with Rach , he had to be straight man . Any oilier combination fouled up her bravura performances . Besides , when km bel drove , someone had to watch the road and keep everyone alive . Adopting a tragic mask at the rebuff , Sis pulled an old gag that *  | she yawned , flopped down on his shoulder , drooped her eyes , and said , " Wake me up when we get to Oak Brook . " He lunged for the wheel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew , even as he overreacted , that her stunt presented no real danger . Theirs was the only car for three counties , and the shoulder , perfectly smooth , black midwestern soil , the richest soil in the country , lay as level and firmly packed as the road itself . Fields , safely gathered in , spread as far as they could see in all directions , an endless , flat landing zone in any crisis . Nevertheless , Artie countered his sister , ethos for ethos . Completing the rescue , he scowled Wagnerianly and shot back , " Great Scots , woman . You 'll get us all Kilts . " Rachel , giggling , battered his soft underbelly with both hands ; he had no choice but to hold the wheel and steer , under attack , for a hundred yards . He protested , stentorian , " Your mother has told you and told you : play around , and somebody 's gon na get hurt . " The Pinto veered out of the lane as Artie tried simultaneously to pilot the car and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only motion , the One Thing Wrong in an otherwise eventless picture . Amid the subtle smells of end-of-year manure and nitrates , wrapped in the minimalist architecture of the straight row , bare box , and spare headland , they could have disappeared into flatness , agrarian judge Craters , and never be heard from again . Or missed , for that matter . Rachel punched him with an abandon inviting disaster . Artie panicked and shouted , " Quit . Grow up , woman . Snap out of it . Take the wheel back . Now . " They played driverless chicken for fifty feet until she surrendered and took the wheel , grinning meekly . Despite his faked protocol , Artie had the awful thought : We have sprung ourselves , flown off The rest of our flock are snared back in barb city while we , careless , escape across county lines out of eminent domain . Because our father is back home dying , life has never felt fuller . Never more immediate or real . But the crime was too terrible for him to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Your mom has told you and told you , but you know better , do n't you ? " The car jerked dangerously and his words , stripped of the game , sounded harsher than intended . He startled himself with the bitterness that slipped in . Rachel drew up abruptly , tipped off by the tenot in his tenor . She did not take offense easily . Ordinarily , only a solid slug  | could bruise her . But her brother 's sudden turnaround caught her squarely in the face . Her eyes puffed up in rare , hurt questioning , and even Artie 's overeager compensatory attempt to tickle her could not shrink the swelling . As usual when he mucked things up , Artie 's gums let him know . His body parts were emotional seismographs , recording pens spiking at the least flare-up of bad conscience . Gums and colon were most sensitive to offense . Then came lower back . He had twice been unfaithful to the first and still most important love of his life , a blameless , Nordic thinking man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what he had been convinced were slipped disks . Now his gums clamped down on broken razor blades . Not because another man 's creeping virus made him bless his own clean lungs for being . That much was not his fault . His gums screamed because he did not allow this equally blameless woman the same way out . After a minute of silent treatment , he figured out a way of bringing her around . " I 've got a great idea , " he said , slipping his foot over the transmission hump onto the accelerator . Immediately Rachel brightened . Free forgiveness was Rach 's greatest weakness . Incapable of bearing a grudge , all she needed was that the other fellow play today 's game . She pulled her right foot up Indian-style onto the seat and flashed him a look of complicity : if we both say so , it must be all right to break free from the sickroom , to tear back the curtains and breathe . Artie 's gums still ached , so he accelerated , flooring it . Rach 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her horselaugh became swearing . He turned a deaf ear , saying , " Come on . New game . Particle accelerator . " Out of the expanse of nowhere , from its hiding place in the pastel November evening , came the inevitable siren and flashing lights . Artie surrendered the pedal , letting kid sister pull the car over for the arrest . Grinning hysterically , Rachel cursed him , hacked at him , laughed , and choked on her spittle . " You bastard . Bass-tard . You did this to me . I 'll finish you . You 'll never co-pilot again ! " Artie talked over her harangue . " It never fails to amaze me how the police can do that . Every time . Absolutely nothing for miles that they can hide behind . Nada . Guaranteed safe . Then whammo . Prison record . What 's the problem with radar . You invent it for a good cause  --  to go after  | the Krauts . But you never know when it 's going to bounce back and be used against you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the car , Rachel rolled down the window and called back to him , " Officer , here 's your man . He made me do it . Let me explain . Here 's your culprit right here . " With an involuntary twitch toward his holster , the cop carried on with his may-I-see-your-license spiel . Protesting innocence , Rachel dug out her two forms of ID . The officer took them back to his squad car to check her numbers against a nationwide data base of criminal offenders . Encountering the unexpected , a woman of heretofore complete civil innocence , the protector in blue faltered a moment as he came back to the Pinto , unwilling to cast the first blot on her blank slate . Artie seized the instant of hesitation . He infused his voice with such authority and confidentiality that for a moment he convinced even himself of the counterfeit . " Officer , I wonder if you could n't make an allowance for first offense and circumstances . You see , we 've just found out that our father , back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cop swayed again , and the day would have been won if Rachel had not chosen that precise moment to start snickering . Realizing the setup , the officer changed demeanor swiftly and mercilessly . He slipped a toothpick into his mouth , becoming a Kane County avenging angel , rescuing both the law and his own authority from two shameless punks who would stoop to invent an old man 's illness to get out of a ticket . He intimidated them as if they were delinquent schoolchildren , making them answer degrading questions : " Know what happens to people who drive seventy-five ? I do n't like to scrape scum off of the pavement . Is that clear ? Answer me . " Suppressing their giggles , the two Hobsons could not give the desired response . " No . I mean , yes . Right , Artie ? Yes . " Furious , the cop asked if they wanted him to double the fine then and there . Artie nodded his U. of Chicago law-school litigant 's nod . " You do that , sir . Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top . See you in court , friend . Love your shoes , by the way . " Eighty bucks later , Rach , shaving her big brother 's sideburns with her Moving Violation , announced , " You 're going to pay for this , buddy . As God is my witness , I 'll never eat turnips again until you do . " " Me ? I should pay ? You 're the one who blew it . We had that sucker .  | He was about to apologize for pulling us over . Bought the entire prognosis . Then you have to go and lose it . " " Gim me that . Who perpetrated this crime , I ax you ? " " Who was driving the car ? " " Who had the hammer down to the floor ? " " Whose idea was the little recreation in the first place ? " " And what the hell 's a teratoma anyway ? " Artie shrugged , and they broke into hysterical fits . When one stopped , the other 's laughter set them off again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd represent her in traffic court . " We might get the money back if you want to go through the hassle of appeal . " Just as suddenly , his hilarity disappeared . He reached that crest of fullness where everything seemed charged , poignant , rich , comic , strange , remarkable , and worth doing . In another minute , he would stare down the escarpment on the other side . Shook back to a sense of their wider catastrophe , Artie clammed up completely , stranded in accusing silence . But Rachel , bringing him this far , would not let the facts come between them . " Appeal , schlemiel . You might as well kiss the eighty bucks good-bye right now , friendo bendo . One way or another I 'll get it from you . I 'll turn my brothers loose on you . I wo n't sleep until justice is done . " " Hey , just pay it , okay ? You 've made it into the Fortune Five Hundred . You 're on the take . You 've got a lucrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can swing a bloody speeding ticket , I should think . You 'd be a disgrace to your class if you could n't . " " Oh , yeah ? " She could n't keep a broad smirk of retaliatory delight off her face . Nothing matched Artie when he got indignant . " What do you know about the Fortune Five Hundred ? You probably think it 's a road race . " She had him where she wanted him : squarely behind a noble cause . Artie for Artie 's sake . " And what do you mean , disgrace to my class ' ? What class is that , may I ask ? " " Upwardly mobile Boho . " He had to grab the wheel again as Rach went into further fits . Art understood that she did not find the punchline half as funny as she found his righteous indignation . It even amused him to see her eyes water and her brows pinch together as she let loose . He decided that as long as he had her cackling , he would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the folks ' with a spate of inspired nonsense .  | " Do n't be so American , woman . Your conditioning has left you absolutemente boozjh-wa-zee . You sound like June Allyson , know that ? " Who dat ? " " Christ , I do n't know . Ask yer old man , while you can . That 's not the point . The point is . . . " " What 's the point , Artie ? " She rotted with laughter . " The point is , you 'd be a goddamn disgrace to the revolution  --  and do n't you dare ask What revolution is that ? ' ? if you were n't capable of taking one of these meaningless little speeding-ticket numbers and ... " He waved her citation and rolled down the window . Rach flailed at his arms with her free hand , screaming , " No , Artie , no . Pull-eeze do n't . I 'll be your friend for life . I 'll be like a sister to you . I 'll never , never make fun of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't capable , " Artie reiterated , " of taking one of these and chucking it out the window onto the lone and level interstate stretching far away . " The scrap of colored triplicate danced in the rearview mirror and disappeared . " There . Simple . Paid in full ! Vanished . It has , in the face of Eternity , become somebody else 's problem . " Rach groaned a five-syllable " Why . " The word took several seconds , resembling those primal air-raid drills that used to get a lot of network time when she was a child . " I do n't believe you did that . I 'm gon na open my eyes and everything 's going to be back to normal . You know what you 've done ? You 've ruined me . I 'm going to have to defect . I 'll never be able to get auto insurance again . " But in short order , she got into the swing of incendiarism . She began singing the Union Label song and speaking with a goatee . She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could feel no anxiety that did n't shed as easily as late November leaves . " But Artie , eesent trowing dot teeket joos a leetle beet ee-lee-gal ? " " Damn straight . And that 's just civil disobedience act number one . This is the start of a whole new life of political statement for me . The Monk of the Midway turns , I 'll mastermind a boycott of all eight-hundred number ads on TV . And if society still refuses to respond : window-bomb all retail outlets that refuse to turn the Muzak down to livable levels . Do n't want to resort to violence , but if they force my hand ... "  | Artie rarely talked silliness except on the road . And only to Rach , as a general rule . Rachel applauded his last political proposal . " I 'm glad to hear that somebody else whom I vaguely respect is hip to Audio Creep . They 'll probably Muzak the libraries in another five years . My friends think I 'm off the wall . But I swear the stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Artie agreed . " You know how to explain that , do n't you ? Habituation . They set the sound to level three . After a few years , everybody 's ears adjust to where they do n't register level three anymore . And so , if the magic narcolepsy 's gon na keep doing its stuff , they 've got to nudge it up another decibel level , to volume four . Then everybody habituates to level four , and on it goes . I think I 'll call it the Law of Increasing Dosages . Credit you with co-discovery . " He broke into an overly authentic rendition of " Will the Circle Be Unbroken , " bobbling the tune somewhere on the " by-and-bys . " Rach supplied descant . Getting through the chorus , she returned to the thread . " My favorite joke these days is to go into stores with a bunch of friends . Does n't even matter what kind of store anymore ; they 've all got it . Then right in the middle of the conversation , go , Shhhh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You know , the most pernicious part of piped music is how it puts you into unconscious dance steps : One-two , one-two . Your walk turns into a samba . " But it dawned on him that the most pernicious thing about Muzak was that any complaints they made about it remained ineffective , cliched , and themselves background noise . He saw that social critique , this late in society 's collective game , had become ordinary , established , acceptable . " Who are we kidding ? " he explained out loud . " Why bitch ? Muzak ; traffic cops . The fiendishly clever they invented them so that we do n't catch on to overpopulation , test-ban treaties , and poisoned water . Even if we could get to the real issue , acid rain or whatever , nobody really expects that even collectively , which is impossible , we can fix things . f Icrc we are , whining about something of absolutely no significance . Our only common culture is complaint . Antisocial small talk . Complaint is the last tool society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whacked , " Rachel countered . " At least we bitch and moan . My friends do n't even mind the Muzak . They do n't even hear it . If they did ,  | if we put ten million people on the White House steps , do n't you think they 'd pass a law ? " " Oh , Rach . Say it ai n't so . You , defending activism ? You sound like your sister . Lily 's a perfect case in point . She 's just like the rest of us . Sure , she made the marches for a few years . But that was just her ticket to a happy despair . Her niche in the world . " " So how do you explain the kid ? " Artie smiled . " Good question . " Eddie Jr . alone remained free of the antieverything infection . A generational difference lay hidden in the few years that separated the first three of them from the youngest . Artie remembered the scene of a few months back , when Lily had tried forcibly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reinstated draft . Ironic turnaround from how things had been when he was a kid . " The way I see it , you , me , and Lil grew up postwar , in the mirage of prosperity . All the high expectations floating around must have wrecked us for any chance at real satisfaction . Now Edski , showing up after all the appliances arrived and the all the hope vanished : he 's got no reason to believe that anybody deserves anything better . So he 's genuinely happy , gripeless . " They both knew who was next in line for analysis . But neither brought him up , surrendering to late-century anesthesia rather than face , however briefly , the heart of Dad 's dilemma . And that , they half-saw , was Dad 's dilemma . Why was it so impossible , these days , to experience anything , to look out the window and feel ? Because the question itself was already self-conscious . Because the basic four-chambered heart and the standard two-chambered brain were not designed to live in the kind of place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things left outside the window were unknowably huge and removed , in which the old animal legs of progress , long out of control , lopped off by the scythe , still kicked as if galvanized in the harvested , empty fields . Because to get downtown h nightfall , they had no choice but to take the prescribed anodynes and keep to the wheel . They reached emergency . Not knowing how else to back away , Artie turned on the radio and fiddled with it , getting one of the proliferate Chicago Ignore-Me stations . He lowered the volume appropriatek snapping his fingers and humming " Strangers in the Night , " although  | that was not the song playing . He looked over at Rachel , his face a perfect cipher , and asked , " What were you saying ? I could n't hear you without background . " Rach , with nothing to lose but her new criminal record , rabbit-punched him while Artie kept her car on the road . " It 's yer dad 's fault , you know , " she sighed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form . " " Oh , unquestionably . " Artie no longer noticed their mutual habit , initially humorous , of democratizing blame by rendering the old man a " yer . " The gag made unwitting third parties think they were only half-siblings . Artie looked away from her . " And rightly so , do n't you think ? You could n't respect the man if his great act of social protest took some banal form , say , alcoholism , or heart disease . No ; he brought us up believing that the ordinary is our enemy , and we 've got to fight it in style . Extraordinarily . " " Maybe . But nobody ever killed themselves with eccentricity . " The patented silliness slid from her face . She was , for the first time in a while , speaking from need , not just skipping stones . " Artie ? " She sounded frightened . " Where do you go with Westward Ho ' when you get West ? You know , he could have stayed in Jersey , if he was just going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Jersey , except that The Garden State ' is a clear violation of truth in advertising . Or Pennsylvania ? Philly ? Philly 's perfect for falling apart in . Plenty of people fall apart in Philly . Or Ohio ? Goddamned Birthplace of Presidents ? " A scratch of phlegm tore off on the last word . If anyone else in the world had started to choke on Artie , he could have handled it . But for Rach to go to pieces : so impossible , so out of character , that Artie felt his neck flash cold . He could not manage this , not here , not Rachel . But the only thing he could think of to avert a collapse was limp , agreeing . vinpathy . " You 're right . There 's such a thing as carrying this fixation for elbowroom too far . I mean , look around ... " ' I'hey both did . Outside , the last , sourceless light scattered across vacancy , running unopposed all the way to the horizon . Another stunted sob came from Rach 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes Iiqu id , at her brother , unable to add to the unmitigated Illinois landscape ? th anything so small as words . They were surrounded by an endless , tenccicss detention camp of openness where nothing  --  not rage , not native contrarity , not even their father 's final illness  --  could ruffle this  | Euclidean perfection . To stop the car , pull over , and protest to the fields that they were being cheated would be the absurd mismatch of scale of antimissile demonstrators attacking hardened silos with dime-store hatchets . Artie wondered for a minute if he would have to slap his sister 's face . Rach spoke deliberately , a flat matter-of-factness fighting for control of her voice . " What happens when Eddie goes off to school ? Pop 's gon na drag Mom up to the Northwest Territories . Somewhere north of the Arctic Circle . I 'm serious , Artie . He 's going to . And we 'll be reduced to one phone call from them a year , at Christmas , on a surplus field radiotelephone . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Artie flicked off the drizzling radio . He knew that Rach knew that what Pop might do after Eddie went to school would probably never be of concern . He needed to keep her talking , but could not get back to the cutups in one swoop . So he stuck with what had soothed her a little : the truth . " I 'm worried that Pop has only agreed to Hines in order to make a party out of the whole thing . It 's not real sickness to him yet . The most that he 's giving us is , you know ? ' Let 's go see about My War Wound . ' " " Old forgotten soldier ? " Rach interpreted . " So goddamned what ? Let him pretend he 's the sacrificial lamb , so long as he gets the tests done . " Trying to keep her intact , he embittered her instead . She misunderstood : Artie meant to fault Dad for his happy martyrdom , how the man tossed off the insult of daily life as if it were nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemn Pop for reading the newspaper accounts of contemporary madness out loud , shaking his head and saying , " Can you believe this place ? Ya got ta love it . " He wanted to say that Pop 's show of high spirits and appetite  --  the flip quips , sardonic dismissals  --  hid a dark and secret bruise , something clearly and terribly wrong that Hines could n't treat . But Rach misread him because Artie had not said as much . And he had not said as much because that would have revealed that Artie knew as much from personal experience . He too sat iii state at the breakfast table , reading aloud from The New York Times and The De Kalb Chronicle alike the latest installments of national and local insanities , smiling and shaking his head over toxic spills , government double-dealings , bank-underworld liaisons , the countless , felonious , five-finger exercises committed in the name of freedom and sovereignty . Artie himself had supplied Pop with details for I Iohstown , that iniaginars  | tumor that had grown out of the daily press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cheerful soldier any solution more tenable than Eddie Sr. 's own chuckling desolation . But Artie would never give such perversity , however much he himself resorted to it , his Good Housekeeping seal . That was what he had meant to tell Rachel . But she had misunderstood . However much he had botched things so far , he had to keep talking . Something . Anything . Let Rach know he was just across the seat from her . He changed the topic , burying what he could not hope to tell her even in perfect circumstances . " Ever hear of a Dr. Wolff , of Cornell ? Harold , I think the first name is . Harry , maybe ? " " No . " Rachel sensed current underneath , and let it run . " Why ? " Artie should have remembered sooner that nothing consoles better than a mystery . " It 's probably nothing , " he said . " A name Dad called after me on our way out . I 'm supposed to be detective , see ? Figure out what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Taken to crying Wolff , has he ? " Rachel slid back into form . Her voice was once more Rach 's voice . Artie felt safety return , and for the next twenty miles , the two kicked around the enigma . The world became pitch dark . After the toll plaza at Oak Brook , they underwent the gradual escalation of nothing into vacancy , vacancy into sparsity , sparsity into FOR LEASE signs , lease signs into industrial parks , parks into complexes , complexes into conglomerates into skyscrapers and finally into the Sears ' Tower . Winding along the inbound Eisenhower into the Dan Ryan , " Damn Ryan " in Rachel 's private vocabulary , they picked up traffic until they were bumper to bumper . They began to breathe easier in the anonymity of overcrowding . Artie co-piloted Rach into Hyde Park and up to his old brownstone off Cottage Grove . She had taken him there scores of times and should have been able to locate the building herself , even in the dark . But she never could . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even an adopted one , familiar as she was with the Chicago grid system , could still lose herself amid all the indelible logic . " North Sider , " he razzed her . " Coming up ? " Artie 's sudden invitation surprised them both . Normally , after a weekend of Hobson 's choices , he could n't wait to sequester himself with the law books . Maybe he 'd habituated to companionship ; maybe he was afraid to leave Rach alone so soon . Whatever the reason , he asked her , curtly , not to take off right , m ay .  | Rach tipped her head at him , quizzically , the way a parakeet sometimes will . Only she kept tilting , through 180 degrees , until she sat completely twisted in the driver 's seat , craned all the way upside down , head to the cushion , looking at him as he dangled one foot on the curb . Vintage Rachel , returned fully from the tremor moment . " Say that again . " Coming up ? " " God . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your forehead . " Losing his patience , he grabbed his rucksack , assembled his stuff , and closed the car door in disgust . He had done all that he could for her in the car , and now that she felt better , she fell back into sight gags . He completed the send-off brusquely and was halfway up the walk when Rachel rolled down the passenger window and called him back . " Artie . " He knew , because she used his real name and not some coinage , that he was in for a dressing down . He dragged back to the car , wronged but nevertheless cooperative . He thought , somehow , that she was about to speak directly to the issue , the thing that , in the drive back through the open fields , they had avoided touching on . He knew , by the tone of her voice , that the subject was friction , was fishing , or forgiveness ; something fricative . She would call him out , he thought . Implore him to forgive the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for both falling ill and then evading the differential diagnosis . But Artie was n't ready to forgive . He could n't do that yet , even for his favorite Rach of all Raches . But he had guessed entirely wrong about his sister 's scolding . He had guessed wrong about everything . He had guessed wrong in the car , in thinking that he had to hold her together . " Artie , " she said gently . " I 'll see you soon . Go easy on yourself , okay ? "  | By fall of 1942 , the roundup of AJAns is historical fact . The press does not cover it , but letters slip out of the evacuation zone describing the great rumblings up and down the West Coast . The rumblings explode in molten silence and quickly cease , leaving no record but an extinct and hollow cone . Whole neighborhoods vanish . Prisoners write of flying the Stars and Stripes above their fish crates and orange bins , with no success . Others describe birth certificates and citizenship papers masking-taped to the picture window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick . Everyone of tainted descent is interned , " relocated " in the official idiom , brought to camps deep in the interior where they can not harm tenuous national security . In a few weeks , information from the camps dries up . Letters come through cut to ribbons , jumping right from the Dear to the Sincerely . Getting no replies , many interned nisei give up writing . Years later , history books carry a famous photo with a Library of Congress credit showing " Wanto Co. , " that small fruits-and-vegetables market just across the street , a huge printed sign posted across it reading I AM AN AMERICAN . The shop is empty , the inside dark . The cause is already lost . A stunning image , the moment just after shame ; the photo arrives too late for any remedy . For all its anguished power , the photo becomes a dated artifact , something that happened to the other fellow . More recent tragedies take us worlds farther into error . People are herded out of dance halls , football games , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toothbrush , change of underwear , only what they can carry . Businessmen must sell off their assets for 5 percent of real value . Families are split up and loaded onto livestock trucks , driven to barbed-wire barracks where they spend the next four years . Some camps have unfinished , communal toilets , where a perpetual , overwhelming  | stench lingers on everything . People sleep in converted animal stalls . Children attend camp schools , where they study the founding fathers and recite the Preamble under the aegis of armed sentries . Many die along the way , die of shame in the four-year transit . Even to assimilated American descendants , shame is worse than death . Overnight , the program kills an entire way of life . Now we are all victims of precaution , prisoners of conscience , losing our tune in a world at battle pitch . In the middle of his legwork for the war effort , Disney stops in full stride . Months after the accomplished fact , he sees what has been going on around him . He can not figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saboteurs and spies . He speculates on the role of protectionist interests , racism , and partisan politics in the mass arrests . He wonders whether any fight against might can ever be won without sacrifice of principle , or whether the forces of efficacy can only be beaten efficaciously . Nothing makes any sense to him except that two members of his brain trust have been imprisoned for nothing . The only thing he knows for sure is that his fellow countrymen would n't be in jail without everybody else looking the other way . The morning before he flies out to sell his cinematic brainstorm to D.C. , Disney sits at his drawing board and wrestles up a pen and ink cel of the Mouse . " What do you say to fighting fire with fire ? " he mumbles to the image . With a few deft strokes , he blows a talk bubble above Mickey 's head reading , " That makes a big fire , Walt . " Disney puts his pens down and sighs . He knows the size of the blaze we are up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has seen what the Imperial Navy accomplished in the Philippines . He knows about roundups far more hideously evil than the local one . Terminally evil . And other than retaliation he can not think of a weapon large enough to put this fire out . He exhales , stands slowly , and slinks to his writing desk . Ashamed , he unwinds the speaker cone of his dicta phone and turns on the machine . After an appalling pause in which he can think of nothing , he speaks into the horn : Ariston hudor.  | Smiling to himself because he does n't know which side of this latest catastrophe the Greeks are on , but certain that he ca n't afford to risk another house arrest , he translates : Water is best . This is the secret blueprint Disney brings out to Capitol Hill for his tete-a-tete with the Powers That Be . A government Douglas DC-3 wings him into Washington . Disney knows , that not even his world-famous Mouse has sufficient leverage to charge into Henry Stimson 's office and call the secretary of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the release of his friends . Not with a war on , anyway . But he has another plan , more powerful than frontal assault . Stimson , the man who , blindfolded , stuck his hand into the vat of paper scraps to start the Selective Service , roundly considered one of the best public servants this country has produced , drummed out of his own party upon his appointment to FDR 's cabinet for speaking softly and grinding a big Axis , greets Disney from behind a mahogany cruiser , shuffling through four-color maps of the world . The secretary stands and delivers the obligatory accolades : he has seen and loved the first rushes of Victory ' T'hrough Air Power . Walt thanks him graciously , giving him a Mickey watch and autographed cartoon photos . They get down to business . Disney , armed with sketches and storyhoards , presents his idea for the feature-length , revolutionary motion picture You Are the War . More articulate and charming than ever , he sells the plan for all he 's worth . He claims this unprecedented wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boost to home-front morale that will break the back of the Axis . The picture will show contemporary America its own front stoop , awaken it to the fact that it alone , and not High Commands and secret conferences , determines what is past , passing , and to come . " Think Fantasia , " Disney urges , " only set in Aunt Edith 's Victory Garden in Smith Center , Kansas . " Disney will show , using every fabulous technique in the book he himself has written , that no fairy tale ever told can match the here and now for sheer mystery , urgency , and power . Stimson is hooked from the start . IIe raises one halfhearted fear about  | the scope of the proposed scheme : timid members of Congress might object that the material would better serve our literal soldiers overseas . Disney reassures him . He urges Stimson to think imaginatively about the long-term benefits of such an epic ode to the national spirit , payoffs that will outlast wartime . He promises that he will school recalcitrant legislators on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuade any objectors by pointing out that we could not have won the first war without Chaplin , Mary Pickford , and Irving Berlin . If we do n't answer Triumph of the Will at once , theirs may . This is Democracy 's testing hour ; he , Disney , the reigning , preeminent statesman of American values , must be allowed to pull all the stops for his cinematic slap in the face of totalitarianism . Out from the top drawer comes Stimson 's checkbook . The secretary fills in the payee and signs it . He pauses at the amount , giving Disney a significant look : what do you need ? Disney looks him back , stating a figure higher than he expects to get , a staggering budget by 1942 standards . If Stimson turns down the number , he 'll be softer on the next point . But Stimson fills in the figure without flinching and says , " I assume that 's just a first installment . " Disney begins to get an inkling of the real power lurking underneath the currently popular contradiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the check and tells Disney to make something for all of us , something that will last . He turns his back on Walt and goes to his window , looking out on the Lincoln Memorial . A sweep of his hand indicates the panorama of classical revival buildings . But these marbles have always made Disney nervous , as if one look in the other direction would reveal an enormous pillared stadium filled with Vienna Choir boys . He demurs , saying that his film must be about the median fellow , the American 's American , the butcher , baker , fruit-and-vegetable vendor , who masterminds history without even knowing it : You are the war . Stimson nods his head abstractedly . " Perhaps . But no jingoism . Film it for the future , so that a national switch in enemies will make no difference . " Disney is taken aback . Stimson sees the dismay and patiently delivers political-science lecture number one : the ins and outs of adversarial relations . " Do n't be too concerned with this little scrap we 're having , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that matter . ' They are only today 's enemies . This too will pass . The director of Mission to Moscow , for  | instance , as blamelessly patriotic as he is now , will find himself embarrassed in a few years . " Walt gets a quick glimpse of the divvied-up postwar world . He asks Stimson point-blank if it 's the Russians , our allies , that we 're really after . The secretary of war just grins sadly and shakes his head no . Disney has seen that grin before . He places it with a rush : I 'll huff and I 'll puff and I 'll blow your house down . What only now occurs to the animator of The Farm 's Face is that the civilized world stands on the threshold of liberty , the cutting edge of the age of universal justification in the name of necessity . And he can not believe what he sees over that threshold . Stimson stares out over the memorial parkway , exercising the statesman 's prerogative of holding conversations with his back turned . He muses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waxing nostalgic , wishing it were still possible for Disney to retrieve and film another world like that one . He speaks of Flushing Meadow as if it took place three centuries and not three years ago . The man who got his start busting trusts for Teddy Roosevelt stands gazing upon a new and unfamiliar landscape . He watches the old one roll down the Potomac out to the ocean . He falls silent . " History , " Secretary Stimson finally says , turning to Disney , " is servitude . " He implies that this year 's alignment  --  the laps and Germans as the incarnation of evil , China and Russia as the heroes  --  is irrelevant , a deliberate and misleading bill of goods come the inevitable 180-degree reversal just a few years down the pike . What will the war films of thirty years hence look like , when half our market is in Germany and japan ? " Make something that will last , " the secretary reiterates . Stimson gazes out on a world where it has become irrelevant whether or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth for their gold inlays or play ringtoss with brains and bayonets . Irrelevant who , exactly , pulls the severed tendons of a dissected Jew 's hand , making it wave hello for the recording scientific camera . A subterranean current of darkness has made its way to the surface of daily life and can no longer be pushed back down . He describes , wordlessly , how national states must now take up the game , learn it , formalize it with power politics and covert operations . We have given birth to the world of the permanent threat . This much Disney understands the Cabinet man to say . But he can not tell if Stimson , the man who more than anyone else has his finger on the present 's pulse , implies that the battle is already lost , or if he is pleading  | with Disney , the Mouse , and the power of enchantment as if they were the world 's last chance . He does know , however , that this ambivalence will make the secretary no more agreeable to his next request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blank check in mind . " Mr. Secretary , " he interrupts the other 's reverie . " For this project , I 'll need a staff " He tells Stimson how his own studio is booked solid with government work for the next three years . No problem , says the other . Hire what you need ; the bankroll is here . Disney explains the difficulty . He needs sets , costumes , actors , artists , writers , construction engineers , technicians . For a project this size , Disney says he 'll need ten thousand bodies . It 's Stimson 's turn to be taken aback . " Where can we find those numbers in wartime ? " Walt glides over to the colored maps on Stimson 's desk . He finds North America , locates the Southwest . He puts his finger down on a small town that was not on the map before February of this year . The implication sinks in . Stimson raises his head and looks at Disney , comprehending , sympathetic . But across his face is the grisly certitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without camps of our own . The only answer to runaway fire is to raise the risk of irreversible conflagration . " I 'm sorry , Walt . We ca n't do that . Even for you . " We must have the courage of our convicts if we want to win . Disney wastes no time arguing the ethics of the point . Instead , he smiles like a man about to pull a larger-than-life rodent out of his hat . He informs Stimson that if he ca n't get the ten thousand bodies out , he will publicly demand to be arrested . Stimson suddenly recalls the well-known but hitherto conveniently overlooked fact that Walt Disney 's grandfather was the offspring of a geisha girl and a midshipman on Matthew Perry 's ship Susquehanna . Disney is , in short , an American of Japanese Ancestry living in that sensitive national security area , Hollywood . The Cabinet minister and his administration are handcuffed by their own pronouncement . They can not incarcerate the man who brought another world to the screen , a world in every way superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they would throw the war . But the law is the law . If Disney holds a press conference and the Feds make an exception by not taking him into custody , the whole infrastructure of the roundup will crumble into  | embarrassing and indefensible double standards . The situation is what is known in political science as a hot potato . Stimson is trapped into meeting Disney 's terms . He agrees to release , gradually and without press , ten thousand inmates into Disney 's private custody . They will be issued special exemptions reserved for sensitive projects . Work papers . Walking papers . Stimson insists that Disney must not shoot the project anywhere on the Pacific rim . They must be kept out of urban areas , under parole , inland , as hidden as possible . Walt has anticipated that , already selecting a secret tract deep in the interior for the filming . For practical as well as emblematic reasons , he plans the shoot for the weighted center of the nation 's population , equidistant from every average you he will eulogize . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from the town of Disney 's birth , hidden in covert and invisible fields of corn . The interview finishes . Disney takes Stimson 's hand , strides from the office , and reboards the DC-3 . He flies from Washington straight to that new jail out near Bonneville Flats , Utah , where his two employees are held . Walt scrambles down the improvised exit ramp onto the desert runway , flashing his startled welcoming committee his disarming trademark grin . He finds Tom Ishi and Ralph Sato , his fellow nisei , who greet him courteously but listlessly . He is astonished at their transformation . Well fed , well clothed , well treated , his friends are nevertheless little more than walking broken spirits , a condition familiar in prisoners of war . Walt takes a guided tour of the camp , ending up at the bunkhouse Sato and Ishi share with five other captives  --  two businessmen , a lawyer , an engineer , and a junior-college president , Americans who have fallen through the wartime cracks and are lost . He huddles his seven fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what if suppose they could prove to their wardens that they are a national resource and not a liability . Suppose that even those of enemy extract can prove to be cis good Americans as the next duck . He eases them humanely into the escape plan that will spring them all from jail . But not too abruptly , or their hearts might ossify . Slowly Disney unfolds it to them : they can enjoy special exemption , walk away from this place , but only if they agree to partake in a massive escapist and propaganda project on a scale larger than anyone has ever  | dreamed possible . The film must do more than merely prove the patriotism of the AJAns who put it together . It must reveal the spirit of the nation itself , contribute to the common defense , promote the general welfare . Every shot , camera angle , and inked image must celebrate the American , showing in an immediate , visceral , and irrefutable way why he and nobody else is destined to win this one . If , calling on both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that convinces enough people of the inevitable victory , then the inevitable will follow . The vote in the bunkhouse is unanimous , Jeanette Rankin 's theory of democracies notwithstanding . Anything , even conscription into working on the most shamelessly nafve and flag-waving cartoon imaginable , is better than spending another night of unearned humiliation . They ratify their allegiance to the project by taking the nicknames Dopey , Sleepy , Happy , Grumpy , Doc , Doc II , and Doc III , because none of them , including Walt , can for the life of him remember all of those other dwarves ' names . Over the next weeks , Disney demonstrates his genius for administration . He and the dwarves scour the one hundred thousand prisoners and assemble a crew possessing extraordinary and varied creative skills . Countless brainstorming sessions later , the newly formed nisei corporation has in place all the logistics for the transfer of these ten thousand to the planned midwestern location . With an unlimited budget , the Acquisitions Committee buys a vast maw of farmland at wartime prices . They purchase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanse of cornfields : the birthplace of barbed wire . Advance construction crews move out , appropriating an old barbedwire magnate 's mansion for use as HQ . They construct living quarters , dining hall , even a small auditorium for screenings and meetings . In the first week of December 1942 , they stage the groundbreaking . A bank o/ documentary cameras catch the moment when Disney paces out the area by foot . The film is developed and sent to Washington . Then the Steering Committee freezes all further construction until they have a better sense o/ what they 're doing . For truth is , neither Disney nor his associates Ishi and Sato nor the other five dwarves nor any of the ten thousand extended support personnel , only a handful of whom have ever worked on a movie shoot before , has anv real film script in mind . The project has been from the beginning nothing  | more than airy nothingness with an urgent motive . Disney , from the day he was caught reading Rilke into his recorder , has decided that he would first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the specifics of freeing the wider audience of millions . He has appropriated a considerable government sum to make something only marginally more planned than home movies . Inside the enclave , however , the atmosphere is one of joyful carnival . A plaster cast of Mickey rises larger than life over the new village : black-tailed , white-gloved , hollow-irised , hemisphere-eared . For the time being , the scriptless prisoners of war enjoy the estate privileges of Lords of Misrule . All the while , a steady stream of newcomers trickles through the gate . Many drop and kiss the frozen ground , although it is the same ground they have just escaped from , and in many ways the same compound . The only thing they do have , aside from Stimson 's mammoth check , is a vast , flat , empty , infinitely pliable , blank slate of land cordoned off with wire . They can make of it anything they choose . At groundbreaking , Disney delivers an inspiring address to the small cadre of still-assembling ranks . He tells them to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Think one step beyond verisimilitude . Do not stop at the goal of creating a replica " just like real life , " but imagine a finished product that fleshes out real life and improves on it . He promises that what tech engineers can not build , what cameramen can not capture in the lens , artists , under Disney 's supervision , will paint right on the emulsion with animating pens . Trust to imagination , keep good faith , and technical matters will attend to themselves . Disney , ever the American Pragmatist , wraps up his speech resoundingly : " Soon , we will get to work , make in this blank place a two-hour adventure that will change the way people look at their part in the big picture . We ca n't see the finished shape yet , but we 'll discover what we 're after as we go along . 1/ we love our material , we can make a picture that will hasten the advent n/ the camp-free world . " I ) isney steps down from the makeshift podium to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he has set out on the rickety , impossible , and enormously suspect enterprise of making a populist epic . In the next / . ' w days , he manufactures busywork for the cast of thousands : orders for a dozen sets , three sound stages , developing rooms , offices . He does not  | hope for great results , but he must start producing something tangible . What comes of the collective camp spirit surprises even Disney . By the first thaws of 1943 , the set begins to blossom with inspiration . A band of houses appears , forming a filmable Main Street . Not far away , three newly released generations of artisans revive Oriental papier-mache technique and raise a convincing model of the snow-capped Rockies . Painters create whole Manhattans out of muslin backdrops . Others , without instruction , do what they know how . Some sew , some script ; others orchestrate , hang lights , or practice handling cameras . Disney marvels at what can come about when ten thousand voices hash out their community rules with no vested interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film . Most important , he finds the film 's hero . For once it is not Ike , Marshall , Walter Pidgeon , or any of those iconic soldiers . For the hero of this most ambitious Disney epic yet , Walt will pluck an average face right out of the theater audience . The hero of this prodigious , unprecedented undertaking will be the Man Behind the Man Behind the Gun . A returning burst of the old inspiration that has been bottled up ever since he first caught a glimpse of the film tells Disney who the lead must be . Taking an inadvertent tip from the nostalgic Stimson , he will return to Flushing Meadow . What happens when a wide-eyed boy wakes from a dream of progress to find himself the king of swing-shift swing time ? What happens when , from behind the billboard announcing Coral Sea and El Alamein , he suddenly emerges , colossally real , as persistent as the sixth in an Andrews Sisters chord ? Walt will find that boy , the one who stood in ' 39 marveling at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bud Middleton to his position in the home-front line . The boy , nearing draftable age , will be the film 's star , the force ' leading the way to that promised , future world . The kid ought to be easy enough to find . He 's worked in Hollywood . He 's a natural in front of the camera . All Bud needs to do to emblemize Americans is be himself . To stand for everything there is , he must simply do what he has always done : be Bud Middleton , in the here and now . The boy 's story will certainly fill five reels , especially with Mickey as co-star . " After all , " Disney says , resorting to a favorite phrase , " there 's more to any dwarf than any of us suspects . " By the time Disney takes off for Hollywood to track the boy down , the  | movie set has been christened . Someone invents a sobriquet that catches on like cholera . Although they know it is a little fulsome , the nisei can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of craftsmen creates a pastel banner to hang over the movie set 's main gate . For text , they reject the first proposal , WORK WILL SET YOU FREE , in favor of the far superior : IT AI N'T NECESSARILY SO Disney stands under this gate with his right-hand man , taking leave of the community and vowing not to come back without the movie 's hero-to-be . He and Sato look back on a flurry of activity spreading irrepressibly over the former cipher of land . " All this motion , all this doing , " Sato exclaims . " My God ! We are actually going to pull this thing off : " He meets Disney 's glance , and falls silent . Very quietly , he asks , " We 're really sprung , then ? It 's really up to us ? " All Disney can answer is , " Tell me how free we are , Ralph . You tell me.  |  | " Buffalo gals wo n't you come out tonight . . . " Eddie , Jr . had left Pop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lily to the shipwrecked house , and let Artie and Rach drift out of town on Illinois 5 . He had felt no qualms about making his own emergency exit in the company of friends . Pop had promised to turn himself in in a couple of weeks . Eddie Jr . could do nothing between now and then but give in to November at eighteen . And that came as easily to him as the answers in the back of an algebra book . At the end of the evening , warm in the belly of his friends , Eddie paired off with the prettiest , a junior named Sarah . He had talked her into seeing the second showing of Fantasia at the Egyptian , De Kalb 's 1930s Deco revival theater . Now he walked her back home , singing in two-part harmony , " And dance by the light of the moo-oon ! " The duet , flush with possibilities , hung on the deserted street . Eddie grabbed Sarah around her willowy waist on the cadence . " God , that was great . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donna Reed . " Sarah , lovely in the limpid darkness , looked puzzled . " Donna Reed . You know . From It 's a Wonderful Life . " Astonished at not yet ringing the bell , lie added , " Tell me you do n't know it ! Impossible . It 's on a hundred times every Christmas . What were you , born yesterday ? " And answering her mumbled , tentative rejoinder , " No , that 's Judy Holliday , nit . " Eddie shook her lightly by still unknown shoulders , scolding her in pantomime . " Know what my pop 'll say when he finds out his flesh and blood spent the evening with a woman who confused Donna Reed with Judy I lolliday ? Out of this house ! You 're no son of mine . ' " In fact , the only response Dad ever made regarding any of the girlfriends Eddie brought home was the sad , cryptic chant , " Girls , girls , gals . " ' ( ) ncc he had said , confidentially , " Remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would you trust an appraisal of the fairer sex from the folks who gave you the Maginot Line ? " That was the closest the two had ever come to discussing romantic love . Sarah lifted her head to him and said , " I 'm sorry . I have n't seen very many of the classics . " Eddie , hearing only her eyes , slipped his hand down into Sarah 's floppy jacket pockets and played there . " Who said anything about seeing them ? I have n't seen three quarters of the old films I talk about . You just have to know about them , is all . " " So how is it that you know all about them ? " " Blame it on my folks . They raised me on old-movie references . " " Just a slave to your upbringing , I suppose , " Sarah said archly . Eddie felt convinced of his suspicion that she was somewhat smarter than he , and infinitely more cultured . She played the cello , for God 's sake . He had to step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The kind of over-his-head treading for dear life that he lived for . " I was raised to blame myself on my being raised that way . How 's that ? " Sarah gave a sophisticated " Ha ! " but drooped her shoulder toward his at the same time . Eddie supposed that indicated the answer was just fine . " Funny you should ask , though . About my upbringing . I was designed by committee . Sins of the fathers , and all . Nature versus nurture is one of my dad 's favorite debates . But my father , he never comes down on one side or the other . He asked us once whether a person raised in solitary confinement can know what it means to get lonely . " " Your father asked you that ? " " Yeah . Over hot oatmeal , as I remember . " " Really ! He sounds remarkable . " " Uh , that 's the polite name . Look , I had better warn you about my family right now . They are n't the Cleavers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's Ward and June , for those of you just back from the rococo . Sarah shoved him and pulled his hands out of her pockets . " Enjoy the man , " she ordered . " Mine just talks about what 's wrong with the car . What about the rest of your family ? Are they nature or nurture ? " Eddie dropped into the tones of dramatic voice-over . " The close-tothe-chest older brother . The testy , ex-radical big sis . Sis number two ,  | everybody 's favorite flake . The patient , long-suffering mom . All lost in orbit around the master of ceremonies . You tell me . Now that I think about it , we might make a halfway decent sitcom after all . " She drew close again , and Eddie thought that nothing on this earth came close to the first feel of the waist of an unknown quantity . She had an easy grace , this stranger , a way of holding gingerly to his belt loop that made her seem unafraid of the consequences of knowing another person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew that she encouraged it . For some months , seeing her in the halls , he had assumed that she was standoffish , that she liked cellos better than boys . And so he had fixed himself on her . Two weeks before , they had caught one another making a mutual appraisal . The three-second glance proved how bendable the social circles of late adolescence still were . Each strained to find some ' mutual overlap of friends , and at last hit on some contrived entree for breaking into the other 's crowd . And here was the same imaginary girl , made real in a few unbelievable days , teasing him on a late walk back home . Her pretending that he was half as interesting as she could only be early flirtation and a trick of the amber streetlight . Eddie decided that before he dropped her off he would up the uncertain ante , answer her easy style . He started to steer them back to simple teases , but surprised himself by saying , " Pop 's off to the hospital iii a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear that . " She did n't bristle at the mention of illness . Eddie felt a sudden hurry to admire her , before life knocked her out for being perfect . " What 's wrong ? " Ile even liked her wording , how she left off the with him . " We do n't know what 's wrong , really . Vertigo virus . The shimmies . Who knows ? ' I'Iiat 's part of the problem . That 's the subject of the Cleavers ' misadventure this week . " " Do n't be a curmudgeon . It 's not becoming . Not if the man 's not feeling well . " Who you calling a curmudgeon ? " She poked him in the sternum. " ( ) li , yeah ? What 's it mean ? " She gave him the dictionary definition . " I ) ainn it , that was on the SAT . If you 'd have told me that three months ago , I 'd be going to the college of my choice next year . Well , a couple of decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Three months ago , you did n't know I existed . Maybe you should have gotten Laura to tell you what curmudgeon meant . " " How do you know who I was going out with three months ago ? Anyway , I swear to you that Laurie , as she is called by the general public , was just a passing physical insanity . " " She 's a strumpet , that 's what . " " What 's a strumpet , pray tell ? Who was that strumpet I saw you with last night ? " Eddie could not keep his voice from resembling the old man 's . " That was no strumpet , that was my curmudgeon . " " Do n't push your luck . What about Barbara , then ? " " Barbara ? Barbara Simms ? You jest . I was n't going out with her . We were just childhood curmudgeons . All right , we talked about rubbing our bacons together . Once . In the interests of Science . But that 's as far as it went . " Sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him again . " You are unbelievably crude , Hobson . Bacons . ' I 'd walk home alone if Rabelais had n't used the same phrase . " Eddie assumed Rabelais was a passing indiscretion of Sarah 's . Her Barbara Simms . " Who wants to know all these names from my sordid past , anyway ? " " I do , " she said obstinately . And the kid fell in love . " Listen . I want you to know , you have a terrific alto . Beats Donna Reed , I swear . We have to get married and form an act . I know you have a vote in the matter , but listen . We could take it on the road . Take it to Europe . Do Italy . Hop over to the Vatican and see the famous Medulla Oblongata . " Sarah laughed and corrected his anatomy . Then she lowered her eyes and hinted , " I 've studied a little Italian , you know . On my own . It helps when reading scores . " " That 's okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to tell anyone that you know things . " He had heard her excruciating maybe ; I would n't mind Italy ; I do n't mind you . There was nothing to do but maybe he-back . The banter exasperated her . She withdrew her fingers from his and cast his hand away . " There 's no way I 'm going to marry you , Ilobson . You are a proven unreliable quantity . " They walked in silence the length of three houses . The night air was  | cold , but not cold enough for either of them to know it . Near the horizon , just outside of town , sat the hunger moon . " If you bail out the tide with a twopenny pail , " Eddie said quietly , to the motionless air . " Then you and the moon can do a great deal . " Eddie looked at her in astonishment . He did not dare ask where she had heard the phrase . He had always considered it Dad 's private stock , and the discovery that it was known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quick look come across his face . Their hands fumbled back and knit together , static-charged hair to winter wool . " Know what my mother says ? " Eddie asked , not believing that he was going to make this detail public . " She says , I would never dream of leaving your father . I signed the papers , did n't I ? ' How do you explain somebody like that ? " Sarah tucked her chin into her jacket collar . " That 's who she is , I suppose . But I bet her feelings are the real contract . " He could not help himself from cupping both hands over her knit cap , behind her ears . " Well , if that 's how you really feel about the matter , could we just live in sin , then ? I 'll move out to Harvard or Yale , or wherever you end up . Huh ? Pretty please ? " She laughed out loud . " Oh , all , right . If you insist . " The cadence of their step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepping on the sidewalk cracks , still visible through a first dusting of snow . After a silence that any other girl would have surely deflated , he asked , " What do you think of children ? " Sarah 's face modulated to seriousness . Not oppressive seriousness , not brooding agitation or the end of enjoyment , but a richly textured , nuanced , sonata seriousness , the slow weighing of possibilities hidden in u minor key . " I do n't think . . . " she began . " I 'm not sure this is the best world to bring children into . " Eddie dropped a beat . He had heard the notion before . Pop had put it forward once to the older kids when they broke into their twenties : Suppose there was a final crisis in the world and the outcome of everything was uncertain ? Would any decent parent risk an infant to a world turned upside down ? On the other hand , what good do we do by not enlisting new children ? Now , suppose the crisis is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . I ildic , Jr . had ignored the what-if when Pop had brought it up . Dad  | had a way of manufacturing sounds that were n't there . If the world were tearing at its seams , would n't the air fill with riot horns and sirens ? Only now , curling the ends of this girl 's hair , Eddie Jr . understood that they would never get such advance warning . Sirens come only with returning order . All they would ever hear would be a questionable hush . If someone as jaunty , full-spirited , and seventeen as this woman felt the touch of the child-forsaken world , maybe the place was upon them . " We 'll discuss this later , my little chickadee , " he said , tapping imaginary cigar ash onto the snow . " Change of subject . Let me tell you a joke . There 's this famous Broadway impresario  --  that 's the right word , is n't it ? ? who wants to stage the greatest Hamlet either side of the Atlantic . They put out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' They listen to hundreds of guys . Famous , not so famous , good , great , unbelievable . But nobody rises to the heights of perfection this impresario has in mind . Then this little guy comes down from Washington Heights , paunch , receding hairline , shuffling , just off the boat . " I vant to audition Hemlick . " The impresario groans , but lets the schlemiel do his thing , because nobody else has been quite good enough either . " So the guy gets up on stage and after a short silence says , ' Thrift ' ? pretty good , eh ? Thrift . ' Did n't think I knew anything about Willie the S , dija ? Thought I was a big dumb jock , dinja ? " " Just tell the story , " she said , putting her hands in her pockets , refusing to take them out until he got on with it . " You curmudgeon , you . So anyway , he says , Thrift , Horatio . ' His voice fills the theater , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recedes , and he is in another world . He transports everyone with that one word . He goes on : Assume a virtue if you have it not . ' He holds up this skull , says how he kissed it once when it still had lips . " " Hobson , you counterfeit . You really know that play , do n't you ? " " No way . But I 've got this joke down pat . Now please . By the end ( if the speech , the impresario is weeping . The other auditioners ale weeping . The guy sweeping the back of the theater is weeping . The little man on stage has them all in a place where the skull is somebody the l knew . " Sarah took hold of his arm and slowed his walk . " Then the man stops , turns back into a little shlep , and comes down off  | the stage . There 's this moment of silence , and the impresario says , That was the most astonishing , moving Hamlet I have ever heard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you ? Where in God 's name did you get that power ? ' And the zhlub shrugs and says , That 's ecting . ' Sarah laughed melodically , but not at the punchline . " I do n't get it , Eddie . " " Come on , woman . Ecting , ' you see . E-c-t . . . Immigrant 's accent . You see , if he can talk like Hamlet , if he can fly away , change the place , then why does he . . ? " She covered her mouth and doubled up . " It 's not funny , Eddie . It does n't make any sense . " " What do you mean , not funny ? You just do n't get it . You eggheads Live no sense of humor . Come to think of it , I do n't really get it either . Thought you might be able to explain it to me . Blame it on my brother . Ile told it to me . Maybe you should marry my brother . He 's an egghead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handful of his shirt fabric into her face . She said something Eddie could n't catch . " Know something ? You are a terrifically good-looking human bean . Do n't scrunch your nose up like that . It 'll leave little lines . " They turned at random onto Locust . Eddie no longer knew where they were heading . He considered asking Sarah about the Drunk and the Lamppost . They peered into low-lit living rooms , intimate domestic scenes that were fair game from street level , each holding the secret of ow to get by but revealing nothing . They slowed again , as if only faint streetlamps , the hollow moon , chill air , sidewalk cracks , the smell of a old front rushing down a street already folded and put away for the night , illy this collected instant , could lead them to the specific weight and actuess of the world . They had fallen upon the legendary there , or as dose as they could push to it , and all life after tonight would amount to ing to re-create this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One thing I have to ask you . If you ever marry somebody , if you do decide that it 's okay to bring children into is world , do n't name them after their parents . You know : Junior . What yip you do then , besides join Order of the Arrow , or some other : Ik induced , paramilitary , junior chamber of . . ? " Sarah listened to him trail off . She thought for a minute that they were  | going to stop under a shed maple , but they did not . When the chance was lost , she said , " Thanks for talking me into that movie . I 'd read a lot about it , but none of my long-hair friends would ever deign to go near it . " " No kidding . You mean you 've never seen that film before ? One of my favorites . Classic animation . 1940 . Happens to be one of the few old-timers I have seen . " " Admit it . You 've seen them all . " " Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part 's when that little rodent goes up and pulls on the old guy 's tuxedo tails . I always want the maestro to turn around and go , Eeeek , plague . ' " She hit him again , and her grace brought them back to innocence . They compared favorite parts . She liked the Bach best , although she felt that the transcription was a little heavy-handed and inauthentic . Eddie liked the little colored horses with wings . " And speakin ' of rats and plagues and all , " Eddie said , alluding to Mickey and Stokowski , " I learned something unbelievable this weekend . From Big Brother again . Did you know that Ring around the Rosie ' was first played by little kids during the Black Death ? It 's all about those lumpy sores and how they had to burn the bodies and all . " " Yes , I remember reading that somewhere . " " It 's not fair . You ca n't be attractive and know everything , too . Make up your mind and specialize , like everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donna Reed . So they took it again , from the top , with feeling . " Buffalo gals wo n't you come out tonight , come out tonight , come out tonight . Buffalo gals wo n't you come out tonight . And . . dance . . . by . . . the light . . . of the moo-000n . " " God , you 're beautiful . " " Let 's not be blasphemous , now . " " What ? I did n't say nothing . I said , Gob , not God . Gob , you 're beautiful . ' I 've got a great idea . How about you and I . . ? " He took her elbow and pointed to her mouth , then to his , waving his index finger back and forth between the two , inquiringly . She nodded almost imperceptibly , and they kissed a tentative exploration . Eddie felt that it was almost impossible to be less than an inch from the face of another without wanting to shout love like a signed confession . But somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh ! That was perfect . Now that 's ecting. "  | Sarah looked off shyly . Facing away , she said , " You would n't be kissing relative strangers while keeping a certain Barbara Simms sequestered off on the side , somewhere ? " " I do n't know . What does sequestered mean ? " " How about duplicity ? Know that one ? " " Duplicity . **30;336;TOOLONG . Uh , that 's when the half note gets the beat , right ? " She mugged a look of long-suffering . " Men . " " You 've got me all wrong . No kidding . I 'm really a shy kind of fellow . ' Thrift , thrift . ' I stand helpless in the express lines behind those people who try to sneak in with thirteen items . I want to tell them off , but I ca n't get up the nerve . See . . . " He faced her , taking both her hands in front of him . " I 'm really emotionally scarred , underneath . There was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cut an English muffin with a knife , and my mother came howling out of the next room , screaming , Fork ! ' I 've been virtually spineless ever since . " She took his arm , patted him gently on the back . " Maladjusted , are you ? Poor boy . Tell me , what was the greatest embarrassment of your life ? " " Hmm . Tough one . Let 's see . There was the time in Sunday School , when we were saying the Lord 's Prayer just prior to heading off for the work week , and we got to the big finish  --  kingdom , power , glory for everandever  --  and I just kept going on with the Hobson evening version , ' God bless Mommy and Daddy and Lily and . . . ' An unfortunate solo that my peers did not soon let me forget . How about yours ? " " Well , " she grinned a sheepish , demure , but absolutely fetching overbite smile that made Eddie squeeze her shoulders in appreciation . " Last summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full scholarship , I stepped off the bus in front of the entire music faculty and my suitcase exploded and all my clothes came bursting out . " " Oh , Jesus . How indiscreet . Come on . You can do better than that . Let 's talk real embarrassment . You know Paulie Kogan , the stocky guy ith the wire rims ? Last year , we were supposed to do weight training for some stupid jock thing or another , and he comes to me and says , Eddie , do n't pick me up tonight . I 'm leaving town on a family thing . ' ' Oh , what 's up ? ' I ask . ' My dad 's dead , ' he says . And before I know what I 'm saving  --  stupid , middle-class , knee-jerk  --  I say , ' Oh , I hope he gets better  | soon . ' You wanted embarrassment . " They fell silent ; stupid , middleclass , knee-jerk silence . Sarah sensed it was n't Paulie 's dad that stopped them in place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real contenders for the title , the public incidents involving Pop and his proclivity that he might consider telling this woman after he got to know her better . Like in another twenty years . He assumed a virtue , and continued comically . " My life is one continual embarrassment , really . Confusing Lerner and Loewe with Leopold and Loeb . You know , pronouncing epitome like it looks . I hate being at the mercy of words . Gon na hafta learn a few one of these days . " Sarah stopped . She pulled Eddie to her , and returned the previous favor . To cover her awkwardness when they drew apart , she said , " We ought to do this walk again in the spring , do n't you think ? I love it when it 's rained lightly while you are in the theater , and when you come out , everything smells of earthworms and something about to happen . " Eddie matched her voice , enthusiasm for enthusiasm . " I know . How the air fills with spore cases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off of tree branches and lands on those bungalow-looking structures ? Here 's a couple . " He produced an imaginary sample . " They grow up around the tree trunks , and then the water force makes them release this powder into the air . " It was , he was suddenly aware , not one 's standard high school dialogue . But something about Sarah made him trust her without being able to help himself . Anything else would be that word : duplicity . " Here 's one . Go ahead ; tap it . The spores are in your hair ; let me help . " He held her strands up to the light . " These are among your more serious fungi . They are n't ones to dance around in fairy rings to The Nutcracker Suite , for instance . And look , see how the water pulls itself into spheres on the surface of the leaves ? And underground . . . " He overturned a rock , revealing nothing but the frozen ground . " Bugs ! " Sarah exclaimed , a cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had somehow jumped together into the same lost place . But since she had proved herself perfect in every otlici way , he took this additional sympathy in stride . " Sure . The night 's when they really come out . More beetle activity pc ! square leafstuff at night than anyone imagines . " It was below freezing ,  | and crouched on the ground , they could not help but start to feel it . She was on her knees beside him , peering intently . He put his arm lightly around her , gratefully . " Not too many of them this far north , this time of year . November 's tough on the food chain . " " What else ? " she said . He had seen that look before , a genuine interest in whatever there was to learn . The discovery of the complex world under the rock , making the world above it almost livable . " I think , " Eddie said , standing and unfolding himself slowly , " that if I had n't already made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked to make a living doing this , what we were just playing at doing . Digging around in the leaves , studying bugs . " " An entomologist ! " " I 'm pretty good at sketching with a pencil , and I can look at things for hours without blinking . I just like to watch life . Maybe see something nobody else has yet . " " Good Lord , boy . You talk like the chance is gone . Do it , if you love it . " Naw , it 's too late already . Do n't have the grades . And I 'm not so good at the studies part . You know , turning it into a science , with math and all . My sister Rach got all the math genes . She did n't even have to study it . The formulas were just there , intact . " He fell silent . Then he began to walk in circles , animated again . " But think of all these combinations , under our feet . The size of it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of incredulity , which he misunderstood . " Sorry . I get that way as the night goes on . As the saying goes , That 's . . . ' " " Do n't say it ! " She sounded violent . " How did you know what I was going to say ? " Eddie joked . But he had upset whatever she had been feeling about him . They strolled again , turning by accident almost to the front of the Hobson house before he noticed . " Hey ! Look where we are . " The soul of Second Street . " How did we wind up here ? I thought the gentleman was supposed to walk the lady home . " Sarah made a joke about the Equal Rights Amendment that I  --  ddie did n't understand and was afraid to ask about . " Well , I 'd ask you in , " he apologized , " but I 'm afraid my motorcyclegang  --  intelligentsia family would work you over . " She was the first friend he could remember being reluctant to take inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | " Well , " he waffled . " There 's just the four of us . The party 's over . My older brother and sister have jumped ship . Chitown . The remaining three would probably grill you until you confessed . " " Do n't be so down on your family . " " I 'm not down on them . They just never know what to make of my friends . " After an awkward pause , Eddie added , " Want to sit in the yard for a while ? We can dig up grubs , or something . " Sarah nodded eagerly . She smoothed her skirts and began to settle into the cold front lawn . Eddie shot a nervous glance front-porchward . " No , the backyard ; it 's better . Darker . We 've got a swing rigged up , too . " As they skirted the side corner of the porch , they ran right into the cameo Eddie had dreaded . Pop 's face , as drained of blood as the Mariner 's , loomed up through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sharp , frightened shout . " Wave to him , " Eddie said , taking her by the hand . " Humor him . " When they reached the backyard , he put on his most deferential face and said , " That 's my dad , " hoping to ease the situation by stating the obvious . It did n't work . Sarah was absolutely peaked , as white as the apparition itself . " Oh , Eddie . He 's sick . What 's wrong with him ? " " I told you , I do n't know what 's wrong with him . " And to joke away his having spoken more curtly than intended , he added , " We 're running forbidden scientific experiments on him . Do n't tell anybody , all right ? " Sarah sat on the tree swing and Eddie pushed her gently . They talked the quick , idle , expendable talk used to gloss over sudden shocks . He commented that they had n't mentioned Top 40 all night , and that she was a disgrace to her age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that very observation , she returned becomingly to the matter . - " Tell me everything you think you can about your father . " He caught her at the apogee and held her waist until she released herself with the kind of brushing kiss one might give after two decades of shared uncertainty . " What do you want to know about him ? " Eddie began . " He cleans his teeth with strips of cellophane from Lucky Strike cigarettes . And when Mom 's not around , he tells me shocking  --  what 's the word for when the first letter of every word . . . ? " Acronym ? " " Yeah . He invents shocking meanings for the L.S./M.F.T. acronyms  | on those cigarette packs . He 's . . . well let 's see . . . he was in the army . But then , so was everybody 's dad . During the war . The war . Is this what you want to hear ? " " Tell me everything that you think I should know . " " His brother got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weird thing about it . One of the central events of his life , as far as I can make out . With him every day , since . " " Is he morbid ? " " What do you mean : does he get schnockered once a year religiously on the date ? Not really . No death shrines . No ; it just sort of left him with this freak sense of humor . " " Black humor ? " " Coal dust . He 's funny , all right , only . . . only everything 's fair game . A kind of sarcasm , but not sarcastic . He jokes the way people hug at fiftieth-year reunions : too much back-slapping , when what everybody really wants to do is kiss all those shattered faces and weep . He parodies everything . He never repeats the standard jokes . Dad would never do a one-liner for the one-liner 's sake . All jokes walk in one line ... ' " Eddie ? " " Nothing . Just free-associating . He likes catchphrases . Pop is capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same degree of seriousness and importance , both There is more to any of us than any of us suspects ' and ' The secret of happiness consists in not eating grapes just after you 've brushed your teeth . ' He is totally maudlin underneath . A sentimentalist who refuses to put himself at the mercy of caring what happens to other people . " Sarah sat on the now-still swing , her legs underneath her . She pulled her mouth to the side in an urbane twist . " You would n't have picked up any of that , now would you ? " " Me ? How can you say that ? " His irony proved the simple and unequivocal if self-attacking fact : No Hobsons can be trusted . " He wants to know everything . He reads everything , and then he gets talkative about it all , and drags everybody down into the facts with him . Funny . It 's exactly the opposite with my brother , Artie . The two of them read a lot of the same hooks and everything . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " And what about Number Three ? " " You talking about moi ? " Suppose this girl were already lost . The terrifying thought shot up his backbone , and Eddie hunched over . " I say live all you can . You make things worse for everybody if you do n't . " Whether she agreed or simply did not want to disabuse his simplicity , Sarah stayed silent . Eddie began talking faster , without looking at the woman he was swinging . " It 's like Pop never made the compromises everybody else makes in growing up . He hit the age of twenty and looked around , you know , These people are off the wall , ' and decided to regress to what the white-bread company calls the formative years . You know , try it all over again from the top . For instance , he 's got this hobby ... " Eddie trailed off and tried to push the swing . But Sarah would not lift her feet from the earth where they dragged . " No . Tell me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trains . " " Really ? Does he ? Well , I suppose you could call Pop 's thing a model-train set . A surreal monstrosity of a model train . He plans this .. . You would n't get it . I do n't get it . He plays at city planner , on the sly . Cheaper than golf , see ? And you do n't need an opponent . " Eddie put his hand inside her open collar and tentatively , almost frightenedly , rested it on her deltoids . " What can I say ? The man 's my dad . " She touched her hand to his , not to arrest his forward progress but to give him the powerless gesture of comfort . And to direct him to the right place . Eddie talked into the black air . " They say if you want to see how the son is going to turn out , look at the dad . That means if you marry me ? and I intend to make your life miserable until you do , and probably after as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty years , like the Big Guy . My belly will be out to here , and my arms and legs will be this little around . And off to the vets ' hospital . Sound attractive ? " He understood that he had gone beyond the repartee with which she could live . His words had become ugly . There was no taking them back . " But why are we talking to one another about our folks ? We 're supposed to be talking about how pretty your nose is . " He touched the part in question . " Like it makes any difference what the folks are up to .  | We 're supposed to give them something to drool about . What a great time the kids must be having , so young and all . " She laughed , both at how he talked and at the new force with which he suddenly swung her . " Too high , Eddie . " " High ? You have n't seen high yet . We need to achieve antigravity . " She closed her eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face made him call out , " Know what ? I 'm crazy about you . " She opened her eyes wide and just looked . But she had the presence of mind to taunt , " What about Miss Simms ? " " Oh , I 'm crazy about her , too . " All sophistication vanished , and she was once again seventeen . " Jerk ! Play nice . That 's not fair . " " Of course it 's fair . Do n't you think it 's better , the more people you care for ? And I 'm crazy about those hippos and those twinky horses with wings , and the mouse , and the foreign guy with the music stick , too . " He teased her mercilessly , until he found her on the edge of tears . " No , friend . It 's you . As of tonight . " She brightened . " Still , people are really okay by me , " Eddie pursued . " Does n't matter what kind of roof they put up to keep themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with somebody I ca n't get along with . " " What about ... ? " She cast a furtive glance toward the white wood house . " What about wh . . . ? Jesus . My family ? I love my family . Whatever made you think . . . ? " She looked so hurt at his volume , so genuinely wronged , that he remembered the words that had , naturally , led her to that conclusion . " Oh , that , " he said , eyes appeasing . " That 's ecting . " Standing behind her , he put his hand deeper into her shirt . It fit nicely . She struggled up against him , to move his fingers to the right place . Feigning a bout of propriety , she said , " Those are my breasts , voting man . " I figured as much . " " Would Donna Reed do this ? " " No , Donna never let of Jimmy do this . Not without certification , anyway . " And they began to learn about one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the world once more seemed to need speaking about , Eddie said , " Peaceful here . The backyard . A good month , November . Not so cold as you 'd expect . I like it . And you ? " Without waiting for a reply , he began to sing , " Wo n't you come out ? Wo n't you ? And ? Dance ? "  | My dear Mrs. Swallow , you marvelous creature of habit : You are my last certainty . I wake each morning to your daily ritual . I know by heart how you crack open the front door , a litmus test to see what century it is outside today . You haul out your body 's bulk slowly on swollen ankles and close the door behind you . Your key slides the bolt shut so that even I can hear it . Then remarkable instinct takes over . Arthritic bird claws jab at the door handle , jerk it violently , testing its ability to withstand foreign invasion , baffling in advance the burglar 's every alternative . Mrs. Swallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolts buckle , panes pop out under the persuasion of jeweler saw and putty . You head up the walk , take the first main right and you are off : Power Company , Phone , or Water  --  some public utility where you 've worked since the war . But total security eludes you . Every other day you turn back after a block , something triggering the fear that this morning you forgot to check the door . You return to the stoop , execute a final handle  --  jerk . " I thought so , " you think ; " But one must be sure . " Locks against alternatives , as if they could keep the outside out . As if every lock could not be beaten . You lose confidence in your current deadbolt . You put on a stronger one , test it . You walk to work , stop , double back , test it again . All a dare , an invitation to escalate . New preventions lead to better burglars . What drives you ? Was your house robbed decades ago ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size twice . Your trauma is an inside job . Two competing camps split the world down the middle : those who believe precautions keep crime at bay , and those who see that Mrs. Swallow 's  | burglary takes place daily . Sorry to say , you must include in the second your neighbor , Lily Hobson Leeds Dear Mrs. Swallow , Sorry to end so abruptly , but I did not sleep last night and needed to close my eyes . I 'm afraid I 'm back to naps again before noon . I did not mean to judge your little ritual , no more predictable or pitiful than my own . Mrs. Swallow 's burglars . Mrs. Swallow : the bulk , massive ankles , probing birdclaws and darting eyes , whose concern for the nest steals her liberty , whose self  --  protection cuts worse than snares . Species  --  instinct , or true habit ? On certain days , your obsession takes you by the brain stem ; you come back twice or more , surrendering to extended handlewrenchings , a bird  --  mechanism gone wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass , thinking it the promised opening to spacious places . But if I ever woke in mid  --  morning to total silence : I feel the panic just imagining it . Only your audible insistence that outside forces threaten you reassures me that none has yet carried out the threat . You are a comfort to me , wrenching the handle , protecting private interests , interests that keep you under house arrest . You head out each morning for your post , to hover over switches , pipelines , or huge parfaits of trickled power . Or maybe your line is customer complaints . That 's it : you work in Service , answering the accusations of injured parties . You staff a window : Insults and Injuries . All complaints left on your desk at day 's end you get to take home . Back in the unentered house , you line them up on your mantelpiece , scatter them across endtables : other people 's injuries , the heirlooms you surrender your peace to protect . Someone tried to take them from you once . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knickknacks , bric  --  a ? brac , your near brushes with others accumulate through your rooms . Proof that you have lived . Please add to the stockpile of entrapping stuff  | these thoughts from your admiring neighbor , lost at home for much the same reason . Lily L. Mrs. Swallow , One more shot at this , my own obsessive handle testing , an exercise that will never go farther than this back room of my parents ' house , even should I myself ever again get it together to fly the coop , which each day seems less and less likely . My father is fond of saying that only habit can break habits . Only I 'm not sure that habit is behind your self  --  protection racket . Habits can not batter so hard as your behavior . Habits must have results to keep them from extinguishing . Yours is no habitual flinch . It comes from deeper in the nerves than learning . I know from experience what threat you test your door against . You claw , shove , dare the latch to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need . You could no more skip your door  --  check than you could stop breathing . You could not live without this routine . It orders your remaining days , lends them a motive they would be pointless without . You do not really fear a burglary . What could thieves do against you ? Toast the break  --  in with coffee from crocheted tins ? Violate your photo albums ? No , the one you really fear is the officer of the law , making his preventative rounds . What if he checks your door for your own safety , only to discover to his bitter disappointment that you have let the neighborhood down , fallen slack on the one job expected of you : the job of living by common precaution ? This officer , whose duty is your peace of mind , becomes your daily , if well  --  meaning warden . Meanwhile the true thief , never far from the scent of security , hearing your desperate door  --  shaking from her post in the window next door , thinks : " Such measures ! Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is here . The house next to yours threatens the whole neighborhood . Not fire or flood : nothing covered by the standard policies . The whole town is terrorized by my father 's loving either/ors . I steal  | the sounds of your predictable routine , your banging and clattering . Your door  --  test is the noise that keeps me moving . If I did not have you , my only sound would be the total silence that means he has come downstairs and collapsed on the front room floor . How do you still hold out ? I see you as a child , stepping down the same stoop in seersucker , a century ago last May . Look through your diaries and imagined letters . Was n't there a day when the fullness of wonder slapped your hands , rebuked you for wanting too much ? How did you survive the spring ? You have cut and dried the old bouquets , wedged them away in your house . Your claws bang the door on the vanished garden behind it . You lock and bolt the warehouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see you in your hair  --  bobbed youth , running with a crowd like the one I ran with , demanding new rules in the neighborhood . Your ears ache from the urgings of the popular press , the war to end all War . My crowd 's was a different jungle deadlock : " We had to destroy that village in order to save it . " What did you say at twenty , to the charm of paradox ? Did you already give in to the madness of testing locks ? I did not , not yet . I took up the challenge to sanity , the call for conviction . I ca n't bring back that exact shade of those words now . Old formulas , embarrassing , dated , naive . I see you at the moment of choice : resist or be lost . My crowd , for our part , resisted . We made resistance into a game . I became a marvel of Magic Markers and posterboard . You had a different call to arms . While you kept the home fires burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards . You see , we thought the future would be what enough people agreed it should be . And we were sure that belief was all the agreement we needed . Your movement , like mine , must have breathed for that much  --  awaited return to safety when extraordinary measures would no longer be needed . Our cause was the day when our cause could disappear . I hoped each protest march would succeed and be the last . How did your fight against so obviously evil an enemy turn into ours , born in the best of intentions , one sunny day deciding it had no power to stop the next escalation short of resorting to the virtuous letter bomb ?  | Our movement splintered in two . Half said that it was better to play fair and get beat ; to stay clean  --  handed , or destroy our own goal . The other said that dead and virtuous was still dead . I had to choose : go under with the ideal , or throw it away on pragmatics . Worse : what if we won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many jailors . The best we could hope for was a pointless exchange . And from that day forward , my resistance trickled away . My involvement vanished into a vague policy of personal prevention . Once , I had felt compelled to clean up the world ; now it seemed enough for me merely not to litter . Only whoever touched the piece of trash last was responsible . Is that what you came to , too , Mrs. Swallow ? Knowing that all you could do to quiet the howling is to keep silent ? I see you at forty , discovering the bind , and from that day deciding that the best you could hope for was indefinite postponement . That it sufficed for you yourself not to make things go wrong . And that is as far as you have gotten . You pull your door behind you with historic obsession . Ten yards down the street , you double back , wondering , " Have I remembered , or was that yesterday ? " And in following prevention to the letter , you exempt yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the world robbed me anyway . " I watch you for evidence of the last phase coming on . Soon , we will surrender even our small acts of prevention , reduced to feathering our own swallow ? nests . At last , you will give up your routine , lie in bed , think that it is enough to pray your burglars away . But we will both be , at the end , criminally negligent , criminally apart . In stopping no crime , we will be guilty . From active to passive to self  --  protective : we are stuck , at the doorknob , between effective and correct , stepping into the trap in order to defuse it . That is why I write you unpostable letters late in the day , a day I should have spent looking for work , or an apartment , or at very least , a replacement husband . I , unlike yourself , was not born into widowhood , but had to earn it . I was married once upon a time . You may find that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Wayne Leeds , for my own unnaming . No one pressured me  | into believing that good girls marry . I did it perversely , to set back the revolution . The whole thing lasted about ten months . Four months after we 'd moved into our first home , still in the sunny honeymoon , Wayne  --  o took offense at something I did or failed to do . I 've tried daily to remember the issue , but to this minute it eludes me . After my sin of omission , Wayne changed . He began a campaign to elicit from me the magic words that would clear things : an apology perhaps , or a retraction . I would have given it gladly , had I any idea what he was after . But he would n't tell , and it was no good asking . I had to divine it myself or it would n't be valid . He thought I refused to confess the magic words to spite him . But I swear this once I was n't being willful . I simply could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did would wash ; yet , Wayne  --  o insisted that something I should do would help , if I only cared for him as much as I cared for myself . One day he took to breaking things . Monday , my guitar . Tuesday , my Rubaiyat . After several days of attrition I was down to subsistence , and I decided to break the contract . But leaving was n't the secret word Wayne was waiting for . Just the reverse . If he was n't over the edge before , my threatened departure pushed him over . He went through an outline of textbook reactions . First he feigned delight . Then he took to pleading . Then he went into the basement and came up with ten feet of rope . He set it on the coffee table , which I owned with some shame . When I could n't figure out his gesture , he erupted in rage . Before I could stop him he was out in the yard , tying the hank to a tree branch . It was raining heavily , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood on the porch waving a six  --  volt light , not daring to come a step closer . Wayne positioned himself to give me the best view , but it was just too dark . All I could make out was a shadowy figure darting in and out of the globe of my six  --  volt . Then he stopped and after a moment of silence said , " You You think I wo n't do it , do n't you ? ' ' But I honestly did n't know what he was threatening . " You think I wo n't ? I 'll do it . Just try me . " Then I understood , and every scrap of admiration or mystery that the poor male had ever commanded in me  | dissolved , and I just did n't care what path he took . He put me up there in the branches instead of him . Or I had beat him to it . I shut off the six  --  volt , went back into the house , and began looking up bus schedules out of town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelling , " You think I wo n't ? You just leave , and try me . " I 'm surprised the neighbors never called the police . Families all up and down our block must have huddled in their living rooms , listening to the cries of this mad boy seep through their storm windows and insulation . In a few minutes Wayne stopped . He reappeared in the house , the rope coiled neatly around his arm . He went down in the basement and put the coil back where it belonged . When he returned , he was more than civil . He even helped me with my bags . And he 's stayed that way ever since  --  the annual Christmas cards , the occasional phone call , always so dignified . But when I see my ex  --  husband now , or hear from him , no matter how self  --  possessed , I see him in that moment when the trapdoor opened under both of us . He is not a person , but an infantile need . And he knows that I see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another try to live with him in peace . But every boy carries a variation on hanging himself in the backyard branches , in the rain . At least the one I saw did . I love nobody . I feel I am on the verge of loving everybody . Then I step outside my room . And he is waiting there . Mrs. Swallow , pull the latch , bang it , twist it left and right , but never suspect that we lock our burglars inside . He is here , that boy , hiding where I have come to escape him , playing a more sophisticated version of the same rope trick . My father , blacking out , seeing things . He brushes his teeth and his gums bleed . " You think I wo n't do it , do n't you ? " He spends long hours late at night , inventing a protest , an alternative history , all the details tailored to suit him alone . My father lives in this place , his third spot between the effective and the right . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a trapdoor , a rope , a tree , out in the darkening backyard . If he had a stroke , who would I go to , my brothers and sister gone , and my mother in pieces ? Who would come  | stop him if he set the house on fire , or took to breaking things ? No one , no one at all , up and down this evacuated , silent and A  --  framed street except the neighbors . You , Mrs. Swallow . I am condemned to come to you . There is no one else . You must lend me your answer to being alive , the force that keeps you here in one piece long after you should have gone home . You must teach me that love for the trap that keeps you rattling the locks , refusing to quit resisting , to give up the senseless ritual as lost . You must tell me how to care for the man , instruct me in that stupid , repetitive checking . A care indifferent to the consequences . Compassion unconcerned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like laundry or trash . You must give me your trick , or I will steal it . As it is , I barely have the strength to evade another day of Classifieds . Someone is out in the dark backyard , swinging . Tonight , it is just my little brother and his newest charmer . Pop 's off in Hobstown , gum  --  bleeding , or passing out . Mother is abiding . Across the way , you read by kitchen light , browsing a hardware catalog for security supplements . You prepare for bed , slip under the covers , certain of today 's lesson . In another minute , you are in that place where there is no fight between right and efficacy . But you will only be there an instant before you bolt upright . You have forgotten to check . But it will be too late . Someone will see your oversight of locks . The long  --  feared burglar will have broken in . Running up to your bedroom in the dark , breaking your heirlooms all the way , she will burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shouting save the man , shouting do not be afraid , it 's only your neighbor.  | In a suburban London movie theater in the spring of 1943 , Alan Turing sees a matinee of Disney 's masterpiece , Snow White and the Seven Dwarves , the first feature-length animation . Turing , at the tender age of thirty-one , has already been as instrumental in saving England and the entire Allied war effort as any other single human . Without firing a shot , he keeps his green island afloat in the blood-dimmed tide of Nazi bombers and submarines . He gives civilization this second chance by tapping into the mind 's miraculous ability to model and simulate . In the apocalyptic game , where victory goes not to the side that can wage the most violence but to the one that second-guesses better , Turing has discovered a way to find out what the other side 's murderous millions are about to do . He steps from the darkened theater into the blinding light of midday . Still savoring the film , though this was not his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grainy light of the wartime street before heading back to his office , a nineteenth-century estate named Bletchley Park , fifty miles from London . From this headquarters , Turing and a cadre of mathematical brains provide the steady stream of hypotheses needed to crack the German Enigma Machine code . Out of the gibberish of infinite decipherings , Bletchley Park strains the sole meaningful reading . Thus able to put her ear to the channel and clearly hear the Enemy 's next step , Britain 's casualties plummet and her inflicted toll soars . We now know Them as well as they know themselves . So long as Turing and Company continue to corner Information , the world 's crucial commodity , their side will come out the victor . Behind his desk , a sheet of numbers in front of him , Turing replays , in rru'ntal images , the scene from Snow White that terrifies him far more than any petty attempt by Arvans to set fire to his city : the Wicked Witch ,  | preparing the lethal apple intended for Snow , invoking , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death seep through . " The imaginary image appalls the young man . He knows , firsthand , the power of animation over live action . For the skill that has given him the upper hand over the minions of evil is his ability to create a similar alternate world , to play a similar game of mathematical What If , to forge a crucible of numeric Maybe where real life can be smelted out and purified . The world must first be saved or lost on paper . That 's why the Witch threatens more than Hitler . In his code-cracker 's office after the matinee , Turing senses the real terror lurking behind the billboard . Far from springing the forces of good from this lime-tree bower their prison , the success of Bletchley Park in cracking the Enigma code lands the Allies in a greater dilemma . Turing supplies High Command with advance warning on all manner of dangers : he foretells the bombing of Coventry , with its consummate cathedral . He announces the threat to flights carrying Churchill and Leslie Howard . High Command must choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their code is broken , or do nothing and preserve their Informational edge . Seated over his tabular data , Turing sees the double cut of that edge . It is our only hope for survival , yet we can not play it for fear of losing it . Every loss we foresee but do not prevent is partly on our own hands . Eleven years later , in 1954 , publicly humiliated , Alan Turing will kill himself by eating a cyanide-painted apple just like the Wicked Witch prepared for Snow White . The act will be Turing 's terminal testimony to the frailty of the line dividing mental imagery and life as lived . Disney will read the account of his handiwork in the trade press . The next year , the father of animation will commemorate the father of simulation by building a fantastic kingdom for the consumer of fantasy , a live-in monument to our ability to cross over from the unlivable emptiness of Here into a smaller world . On the same day that Turing returns from Snow White to the business of saving the Free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe inside an enclave of barbed wire , Disney 's paroled planning committee finishes the final edit of a humorous short subject documenting the completion of the studio and set for You Are the War . The teaser runs only twelve minutes  | and is intended for Disney 's private amusement , to show him what the community now has in hand for the still unscripted project . The sole existing print catches up with Disney in New York , where he has flown in search of the ingenuous time traveler , Bud Middleton , whose ability to portray the quintessential American boy is the make-or-break element in Disney 's grand plan . Walt receives the single spool with excitement . He closes himself off in a private projection room and threads it up . He is much amused by the hand-lettered title on the opening frames : The Furious Phase . Next come the credits : " By Grumpy , Dopey , Happy , Snisei , Doc , Doc , and Doc . And introducing . . . " A great pullback shot of the entire crew wipes into white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Thousands ! " The last shot of the credits , although meant to be funny , closes up Disney 's throat with a sorrow beyond telling . It is an intercut of the old footage of Snow , making her surprising discovery : " Why , you 're little men ! " An overdub of the theme music from Bambi trills while the camera pans across the enormous , living ordinance survey map of unsuspecting , frozen midwestern cornfields . A voice-over , perfect parody of a forties documentary narrator , quavers about how a band of home-front soldiers , at the insistence of their country , have lucked upon the ideal geography for establishing a model nation , for starting over from scratch , for beginning again . " From out of this absolute absence of features , " the voice resonates , " this flat , empty tabula rasa , this blank slate of nothingness , can come anything at all , anything that a majority of folks agrees to put here . " There follows a comical , mugging , home-movie sequence of three men in gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for some inscrutable reason , frogman flippers , wheeling on-camera a cylindrical lead canister . They prop the tube upright and motion to it with Chaplinesque jabs . Then one of the frogmen does a double take , realizing that the explanatory gestures mean nothing because the tube is turned around . The three reverse the cylinder with self-defeating efforts , revealing an amateurishly lettered sign reading FAIRY DUST . After another round of ringmaster hand waves , the inmates stand back while the central figure removes the canister 's top with exaggerated caution . He double checks his gas mask and dramatically unscrews what becomes the tube 's lid within a lid within a lid . As he breaks through the  | final seal , a host of animated sprites shoot out of the opened flask startling everyone , including Disney , a thousand miles and several weeks away . The spirit squadron buzzes the canister a few times , then disperses across empty fields . The camera cranes up and over the lid of the container . Inside is an earthen metal powder , which a second team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the colors of the rainbow . The lens gives a quick glimpse before the gas-masked trio closes the flask gingerly . The corny voice-over elaborates : " What you have just seen is almost half a kilogram of Fairy Dust , squirreled away in precious allotments obtained from private , international channels , kept under the most stringent safeguards and security , saved for the most urgent occasion . That occasion is now , with the whole globe pitched in a battle where everything of value is at stake . This potent substance can turn a lump of pasty papier-mache into a terraced garden . " Proving the claim , the next shot shows one of the masked soldiers , fingers glowing with a pinch of the invisible stuff , standing in the middle of emptiness . He opens his hand with a colored flourish and , following a perfect jump cut , the fields around him transform into a bustling downtown . The sequence repeats in another open space : a sprinkling of powder , and up springs a mountain range . Three times in succession the protectively clothed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and quiet residential streets . The narrator explains , " This is no ordinary element . The dust derives its power by acting as the mind 's prism . It is , in essence , imagination reified . " The unaccented voice claims that if used sparingly , " and a mere fingernailful packs a punch capable of amazing things , " the stuff will bleed goodwill across their condensed country 's borders , spilling over enchantment into the finished film . Disney is stunned . While much of the trailer is done . with paint and models , he is nevertheless impressed by the work already accomplished by his pickup team . He watches the staff rally their talent for one final , curtain-closing tour de force . The narration spells out the theory of Fairy Dust more clearly , slowly losing its parodic quality and taking on something of the promise of the metallic glow itself " Can this powder really turn a rock pile into the Rockies ? Can it in fact turn a miniature model of a sleepy town into a living , breathing replica , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ourselves , show us why we rnu.s ( win this  | one or die trying ? Can we be standing in the presence of the substance that will not only crack the back of the Axis and blow this war wide open but also blow the very desire to wage war loose from the face of this forgetting earth ? We dare not believe . But think of what we lose if we are wrong , if we fail to give the stuff a proper chance ? " The final shot , mirroring the first , pans daringly over the synthetic mountains and simulated cities that now tower over the prairies , dwarfing the surrounding cow towns . World World . Nothing on this scale has been attempted since D. W. Griffith 's Babylon set for Intolerance soared above the flypaper shacks on Sunset Boulevard back in 1915 . The scope of the set suggests we fight another war this time , one that makes the first one look like 8 mm . The camera pulls all the way back , revealing the carpenters still extending the edges of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until hope casts its ballot . The film flicks through the projector and flaps loosely against the take-up reel . The screen in Disney 's private viewing room goes white and he sits motionless in the dark , making no move to shut off the machine . The crew has cast the footage as a bit of camp strictly for his own amusement . But under the burlesque of flag-waving , he hears his crew 's own genuine hope in the restorative power of Never-never Land , calamine for a tortured and diseased world intent on betraying itself . He hears his ten thousand fellow internees ask how much a band of visionaries , armed with Fairy Dust , can do to correct history . He feels the cast flexing its new freedom , gauging the odds against good intentions rising up irresistibly on the day the canister is finally uncorked . The final image of the comic short is so powerful that it undercuts its own irony . Real death , global snuffing out of people , slaughter for borders , economics , colored charts , and ideology , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloody mess will fall away , the trailer insists , despite knowing better , if we can just tell the story of one person , tell the particular case fully and urgently and honestly , show how all that this fellow ever wanted is to get along and assist in the harvest of Goodwill . How can conflagration come of that ? If they can tell the Bud Middleton story convincingly and universally , the way to mutual trust might at last become clear . A life-size portrait of a fellow prisoner will reduce temptation to shoot before asking . Future dictators and demagogues will he laughed out of the beer hall . When they  | try to incite fear of the perfidious enemy , saying get the Jew , the Slav , the Asian , before he can get you , the crowd , having seen You Are the War , will say , " Who ? Bud Middleton ? You must be joking . " The secret subtext of the project , which must convince even the wartime censors , is : We man the trenches opposite ourselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its makers can no more not believe than they can stop their own circulation . Nevertheless , however technically impressive the World World set , The Furious Phase demonstrates to Disney that neither steering committee nor cast of thousands really knows whether " Wishing might make it so " has any empirical validity to it whatsoever . In the darkened preview room , celluloid flapping loosely around the reel , the attempt to remedy a world gone madder than a galloping cancer through any medium as silly as documentary cartoon seems ludicrous . This war is the largest coordinated endeavor ever undertaken by man . Brooklyn Bridge , Boulder Dam , and the Great Wall of China combined are weekend excursions in comparison . Every person on the earth is in on the activity , inspired by it . We make love to this employment . Nothing in the entire thread of human endeavor  --  not cathedrals , not astronomy , not high finance  --  comes close to our expertise in mutual destruction . The real game , pieces stretching over Normandy , the North Sea , Suez , the Urals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Singapore , Saipan , Guam , and everywhere in between , is by far the greatest testament to human engineering and ingenuity , to what collective effort can put together . Beginning with vestiges of horse cavalry , it has already graduated to rockets and soon jets . And this war will be dwarfed by the next one , the quiet , extended chessboard stretching out over decades in unthinkable complexity of move and countermove , working up to its silent denouement . While technically true , it is certainly numerically insouciant for Disney to point out that all vegetation begins in the Bud . For a moment , on the painfully white screen , Disney sees how immense , amorphous , and undeniably real the war is compared to what he means to do . For a moment , the war seems so ubiquitous and undirected as to make the definite article seem ridiculous . The scope and obscene speed of the unstoppable undertaking all around him splinters its monolithic facade and becomes a bouquet of operations : Overlord , Citadel , Greif , Punish-  | ment , Market-Garden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middletons , but Bud , whether buck private or bird colonel , no longer has any real choice in the matter . Disney sees , years before the demure textbooks point it out , that this is the first round of a permanent People 's War . The accounts in the morning papers , with their line drawings and casualty counts , are so many box scores of mass suicide , the first universal violence that will take more civilian lives than soldiers ' . Death will never again surprise us , coming in clean packets out of the sky , from underwater , across the sterilized earth , out of ovens and showers . The only weapon Disney has to fight the People 's War is the People 's Art Form . The madness of the human pageant got you down ? See a Show . Out with the houselights . Break forth the Fairy Dust . Magic powder , absorbed into the lungs and capillaries of the audience , reduces Stalingrad , Dresden , and Buchenwald to you and the you you share the armrest with . All he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good cartoon . All he can do is show Bud Middleton in all his details , convince the audience that his story is their story . Within the confines of the darkened theater , the public 's capacity to feel must seem crucial to the entire outcome of the collapsing planet . The caretaking of seasons , the survival of midwinter , is in small hands , the heart 's private bonfire . He shuts off the dead projector . He must pull off the task in a two-hour slice of everyday life with the ugly spots edited out . A stirring soundtrack , slick set , and pretty leads , Disney has long ago discovered , can convince just about anybody of anything . His movie can manipulate by cropping out , selectively deciding what not to show . World World , that prison-built set in the empty Midwest , must be his lever and his place to stand . He is insane even to consider going through with the idea . But the alternative is to send his staff back to the concentration camp . The sheer enormity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task of selling the war . Victory Through Air Power was child 's play . Agitprop could come effortlessly : a little piece about the boys at Anzio getting nostalgic for the old neighborhood around Grauman 's Chinese Theatre . He dredges up a dusty old bottle of Moxie from the inner recesses of his makeshift desk . He drinks it recalcitrantly , with no idea of how long it has been there . Ile considers the wartime dispersal of his colleagues  --  the  | old Hollywood and Vine gang . He envies them ; just about anything else he might have ended up doing for the war effort would have been unspeakably easier than what he is now considering . Walt rubs his ears for hours , wondering if Huston and Capra , at this very minute making documentaries and cheer films for the army , are having half as much difficulty overcoming the technical obstacles to believability as he . Capra 's making Why We Fight . Disney must make the far more problematic and unpopular Why We Should n't Have To . It occurs to him that Capra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eye-ties too , right ? What are THEY doing walking around free while we 're locked up ? The suggestion is clear : national security is not separable from budding hatred . All the other big directors and producers are off making straightforward propaganda documentaries , nothing tormented about them . All they have to do is keep the camera vertical and the cameraman alive under fire . Major George Stevens , of Swing Time fame , in the Atlantic with his " Hollywood Irregulars , " heads up the Special Coverage Unit of the U.S. Army Signal Corps , directly attached to SHAEF . And there 's John Ford in the Pacific , working for Wild Bill Donovan 's OSS on his most spectacular and convincing western of them all . Ford wins both an Oscar and a Purple Heart for The Battle of Midway , while his buddy and genius cameraman Gregg Toland makes a feature on what Disney 's blood relations did to the Pacific Fleet on the day of infamy . On the Home Front , the private morale-boosting business enjoys nothing short of a creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to Tinsel Town since Rin Tin Tin . As a genre , the War Film runs the gamut from Casablanca and Watch on the Rhine to Four Jills in a Jeep . Even Sherlock Holmes enlists in stemming the Nazi threat . The torrent of films following Hitler 's invasion of Poland already leads to a Senate investigation of Hollywood warmongering and profiteering . The movie industry , emptied of 30 percent of its males , continues churning out celluloid wars as diversion from the real thing , all on the same topic from the same point of view . The sole task of these films  --  and Walt , in his professional capacity , has seen his share of them  --  as well as their chief source of revenue is to mythologize the fighting as if it took place somewhere in the distant past . While Huston and Capra and John Ford shoot real war footage on location with the original cast , countless  | Hollywood hacks throw together monthly remakes of The Prisoner of Zenda , only in battle fatigues with interminable stock slaughter footage , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noncoms and their men . " Sarge , are you se-scared ? " " I 'm always scared , son . What alarms Disney is not the relation between fiction and catastrophe , the profit and pleasure motives . He considers how Guadalcanal Diary , opening even as he measures his next step , must have gone into production within a week of the outbreak of fighting on that island . Similarly , The Mortal Storm , Waterloo Bridge , and Fritz Lang 's great Man Hunt , not to mention Abbott and Costello 's Buck Privates , each released before we were even in the fray , either showed remarkable foresight or were privy to advance information . At this moment , it hits Disney with the force of religious revelation : We have done this . We filmmakers . The world is in flames because we told people that they could cross the line into Anything Goes and get away with it . Leni Riefenstahl put that painter bastard in the hearts and minds of his people . She and Hans Steinhoff and Harlan . And our films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how we wandered into this mess , let it get out of hand . Films that said that Don Winslow and Doug MacArthur are the same guy , that nothing could get so fouled up it could n't get extricated in the fifth reel . Now that the unreal has lured us into it , the war can only be comprehended through the same portal . The war no longer has anything to do with the Casablanca conference . It is Rick and Ilsa . " You wore blue . The Germans wore gray . " That is the only color scheme a captive audience can understand . Paulus versus Chuikov means absolutely nothing . Disney and company are guilty of entrenching the real fight , in most minds , between Munchhausen and Sergeant York . Well , he thinks : if film launched us on the trip into the inferno , then the world 's most famous film mouse must gnaw our way back out . But Disney knows the return trip will be far harder . You Are the War must tap into the same spirit of invention that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What happens on the World World set will be his most crucial work ever , far exceeding the routine war-bond drives . The project 's particulars take on so overwhelming an importance that Disney resorts to the most potent source of creative inspiration of this era : plagiarism . The  | stakes are so great , so much hangs in the balance , that nothing less than pinching from the old masters will do . About some things they are never wrong . The technique he means to pinch is that view of Middle Americana going about its ordinary , small-town dance of courtship and romance that he has glimpsed two weeks before and still can not shake . Disney has in mind to create on the World World set a full-size mock-up along the lines of the town in It 's a Wonderful Life . Disney , a member of the inner circle , has had a privileged early look at the project , and finds it a masterpiece . Capra has shown him the working script , but because of his involvement with Why We Fight , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start it until after we win . Disney 's idea is to place that haunting scene between the youthful romantic leads , sweetly and greenly crooning a " Buffalo Gals " duet , against the backdrop of a world gone wholly and irrevocably insane . Then the audience , turning from their cozy , ordinary lanes down a back alley where bodies hang like pinatas , sliding from Second Street to Second Army , an encirclement too big to fit onto the atlas page , strolling from Bedford Falls into global Pottersville without noticing , will realize that the fate of their own town truly relies on two billion sets of single votes , the sum of uncountable and inconsequential Middleton middlemen . For the sake of the future , he decides to steal that love duet that everything depends on : the hidden chain of connections inherent in George Bailey 's saving his brother from the sledding accident . Only this time , the script will run : if Bud is n't here doing his part , he will trigger a series of cataclysms that wo n't stop short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film to work , the layout must not tip off where the cultivated atrium of Bud 's life leaves off and the genuine garden-at-large begins . You Are the War must have no border , no chalk seam proclaiming " Fairyland Ends Here . Now Entering the Real Thing . " The two must gradate smoothly into each other . The audience must believe , for two hours , that Bud 's decision will determine what awaits them outside the theater . For in truth , everything depends on the successful application of Tinker Bell 's delivering powder . Neither Anzio nor Peenemunde nor indiscriminate civilian carnage renders World World 's cause so desperate . Something else has been let loose , something the Dwarves know little about , something Disney himself has only briefly glimpsed . George Stevens drops  | Disney a quick note about it in the winter of ' 43 , from his toehold in Britain : " There 's something on the continent , deep inland , something immense and terrible , awful beyond considering . . . . Rumors of it are everywhere . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get ashore , but I do n't know if we dare look on it , let alone film it . " He can not name it , but Disney knows that the terror deep in Central Europe already spreads outward . His own country , in the cold light of necessity , considers sending against the laps incendiary bombs tied to the legs of bats . The idea is sponsored by the United States Navy and the Army Chemical Warfare Department . Is the charter of Disney 's film , then , any more fantastic ? It is no more desperate , no more urgent , no more surreal , no more irrational , no more hopeless , no more unrealistic , no more misplaced , than the world it hopes to save by simulating . He sees clearly , as definitive and cleanly lettered as that flask the keystone frogmen uncorked : history conspires toward what we decide to rescue from the pyre . Out of the rubble of Central Europe , in what will instantly become the polarized battlefield for the next showdown , a German will put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fair . " Disney determines to escape that fair , deny the grip of necessity . He sets down the dusty bottle of Moxie , gives the same idea another twist : he will deny that reality exists . He will live only for escape . Put that way , all the evil he means to outdistance comes creeping back . Which is it ? So much depends on whether the other hostage , the audience , dares to make the break along with him . Perhaps no crime was ever righted except through retaliation , reprisal . But he will try another angle just this once , before the light fails . Already his crew has built a place , a little place , where little can trickle into big . They will man it with a mouse whom everyone recognizes and a boy whom everybody knows . Can it serve , for two hours , to improve upon the source ? The answer to that ancient question , a reply from mid-century , will come to be called the Turing Test , after Alan Turing , the man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before the Wicked Witch disperses it completely and expediently , is that a perfect simulation of a thing serves very nicely for that thing . Big can grow out of sufficient , collected littles . The issue is moot . Whatever the prospect for success , Disney and company are already committed to the cash and carry . The nisei have no  | choice but to portray an ideal world and pray that the matinee crowd can chart their private route to it . They can only believe that belief is the only ticket out . They can only hope that the price of living can be paid by hope . Disney fiddles with his dictaphone , brought along from coast to coast for just this purpose . He starts the recording and says : My colleagues in Hollywood have an old saying : " If it looks like a duck , and sounds like a duck , and acts like a duck . . . then call it Donald . " He shuts off the machine and knocks out a telegram . TEASER IS BRILLIANT .

He stops and reads the message . Something is missing but he does not know what . Finally , he supplies , with a perverse grin , the refrain from that old war-bond tune : THIS IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR .  | Dad stood in the Loop , anchored at Clark and Randolph , two weekends before Christmas , on the busiest shopping day in the most populous year in Chicago 's history . More people than at any other moment in time wanted possession of the precise spot outside the bus station where Eddie Sr. now stood and were willing to be ugly , even violent , if need be , to achieve that holiday end . At that exact moment , the world 's population stood at four and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Eddie Sr. read those figures out loud from a magazine to wife , daughter , and son on the bus ride in . " A billion here , a billion there . Pretty soon we 'll be talking real people . It 's enough to make one suspect the sanity of the species . " He proceeded to repeat the figures to a pretty woman of procreative age in the seat in front of them , asking if she would forego having children for the sake of the human race . When the woman reeled around in alarm , lily flashed her a desperate look : Please do n't make a scene . The man is not well . We just have to get him through today . To her infinite relief , the woman sassed back , saying that if the numbers he had just read out loud were true , she did n't see why another halms dozen babies made any difference . And when the barbed-wire contingent disembarked in the terminal belonging to the line Rach affectionately branded " The Dog , " they struggled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of five of those millions , a crowd of cognizant packages wandering aimlessly between porno theaters , dingy retail outlets , and monolithic civic art . Wedged into these few square miles by the lake were more people than had been alive in the entire country at the beginning of the last century . They gathered like grunion by moonlight , buying gifts for one another . And at their still hub stood I ) ad , breaking up pedestrian traffic , panning  | over the abstract multitude of strangers as if just now becoming aware of the awful miracle of fecundity . Little Eddie , Ailene , and Lily stood on one corner of the Civic Center Plaza , trying to edge him on , anywhere , before his standing there doing nothing started a Christmas fistfight . But amid all the obstructing structures  --  the rows of Mies van der Rohe boxes blocking all views except the trough immediately in front of them  --  they could not answer that perennial Chicago question : which way to the lake ? Mom and kids tried desperately to get their bearings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Picasso sculpture on the plaza . He cornered Eddie Jr . Pointing at the famous ambiguity , he said , " My boy , I 've finally figured out who this is . " Eddie Jr . did not want to hear his father 's conclusion . " Looks like a pimple with a parachute on , do n't it ? " the kid diverted . Underneath his unexpected misanthropy , Eddie Jr . wanted only to avert the man until they could sign him over to the professionals . He could feel Pop flashing the seven warning signals . He could feel the man aching to try something as certainly as any mother can feel her five-year-old flexing to throw a good-night fit . But he could not head it off without provoking it . That was what belonging to a family meant . Dad brushed off his son 's aside and insisted , " No . Really . Look closely : think funny nose . Think big ears . Think bigger than life . " One or two seasoned Chicagoans stopped to look in the direction of the cubist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finding no local celeb , no nut with submachine gun hiding in the rusting structure , they passed on . Little Eddie looked from Picasso to Pop and back again . Across the packed and desolate open place , a euphonium choir managed to make " Joy to the World " sound like " Smile Though Your Heart Is Breaking . " Unable to dislodge Pop from the spot , Little Eddie crossed a street at random and attempted to lose himself in front of a window-front elephant graveyard of consumer electronic goods bearing red fire-sale price tags . Let the man have his last wraps , he told himself . They were only downtown , after all , as a delaying action , simply to meet one of Pop 's preconditions  --  a last look at the State Street Christmas windows  --  before putting the man in the hands of the Veterans Administration . Not far away , Lily wandered over to the mundane protest rally that  | spread itself homogeneously across the plaza like a flock of birds under a winter feeder . She strained to read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human rights in one of those subtropical countries where they extracted loyalty with cattle prods . Thirty people forming a fairy ring in Chicago to ward off a thing so distant and unstoppable so distressed her with its pathetic urgency that she returned quickly to the reconciled part of the world , that great majority to whom everything was all right so long as they were allowed to shop . She returned just in time to rescue Mom from a lunatic fringe religious zealot of indesignate denomination who had just given Ailene a copy of holy scripture for free and now angrily demanded payment . " How come I always have to be the one who does the rescue work ? " Lily asked , grabbing her mother by the elbow . " If I had been looking the other way , you 'd be a Hare Krishna by now . " She jabbed not so much at her mother as at Artie and Rach , conspicuous in their absence . Two weeks back they had promised , per Dad 's request , to show up for the holiday meal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premeditated cowardice , had reneged . Instead , begging off Thanksgiving dinner , they had arranged to meet the family when they came downtown . Lily , persistent grassy-knollist that she was , considered their absence a mutually calculated conspiracy , and she held it against them . But all she could do now to retaliate was make sure that Hobson West kept its part of the appointment . Gathering Dad from the Picasso , Mom from the robed evangelist , and Little Brother from the seductive clutches of consumer electronics , she piloted her family through downtown disturbances toward their appointed meeting place . Rachel and Artie at that very instant emerged from the underground Grant Park parking garage . Artie accused Rachel , " I would have gone if I had gotten any sort of encouragement from you . " Without letting him finish , Rach answered over top , " Do n't blame me for making up your mind . " They paused for the obligatory book-gawking in front of Kroch 's on 1'ahash . Glimpsing himself reflected in the bookstore 's picture window , Attic sickened with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telltale indication of what a genuine nebbish he had become : he 'd managed to go the entire tnorning without realizing that his shirt was one button out of line .  | The giggles of a passing pack of teenage girls convinced him : his ineptitude had gone public . For a long time , his terror of ending up alone had driven him into semiseclusion , a you-can't-fire-me , preemptive quitting . His deep need for conversation led him into increasing bouts of silence . But he had not until that moment suspected the broadcast signal clear enough for all except himself to hear . Hiding within the pristine button-down Oxford lay this declaration of secret slovenliness , a deliberate act of self-sabotage , a plea to the outside world for charity , like those plaintiff requests of " Wash Me ! " written into the dust of neglected cars . Witnessing his distress , Rach laughed out loud . She had noticed her brother 's oversight an hour earlier when she picked him up . She had waited on edge the entire drive downtown , wondering how long the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slapstick inherent in his disaster , she squeezed his arm and wheedled , " Artie make a fox paw ? " The misbuttoning at once became his sister 's fault . Artie filled with the urge to take retribution on her . He could hardly enjoy the instant justice of a lynching , even in the lawless Loop . So he contented himself with an unbelievably vile and colorful string of verbal abuse , a surge of pottymouthing invective that stunned even himself the moment he put the finishing touches on it . He at once regretted having overreacted ; his lack of restraint was , like his inability to dress himself , one more dead giveaway of his dissolution . Far from taking offense , Rach greeted his creative profanity with astonished delight . She caught her breath and gasped , " I 'll get you , my pretty , and your little dog too . " She leapt at him , chasing him through the holiday-shopping crowd . Artie took off , hooking west on Madison toward the designated rendezvous spot on State Street , that Great Street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flock of pigeons ? little more in his estimation than rats with wings  --  all the while repeating to himself , under his breath , " I 've become a self-parody . " Rounding the corner onto State , Artie once more felt that shopping , more than any other activity , was now the only thing everyone had iii common . It had become our entertainment , work , social life , and culture , the only thing that got people outside anymore . A study in Brownian motion , Artie bounced from parcel to parcel , keeping a prcth  | good clip until he saw the family loom up out of the **30;368;TOOLONG crowd . Swiss Family Hobson stood marooned outside Woolworth 's , the folks looking nonchalant , Eddie Jr . trying to look jive , and Lily managing to look a little like Joan of Arc after the stake-out . Only here , as the dense exercise in human-population dynamics split into countless Markov chains and eddied about his familiar domestic group , did Artie finally see : they were lost , truly lost , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Christmas crowd cut a circular bypass around them . They were clearly in quarantine , written off as injured , fair game to the herd 's trimming predators . Just as suddenly , the insight slid away from Artie as he noticed a side effect to Pop 's problem , a symptom less dramatic than the lesions and visions and passing out and bloody toothbrushes . But it was no less shocking for being relatively benign : Dad was clearly smaller than Artie remembered him . The man had begun to shrink prematurely . Artie , still eluding Rachel , easily could have checked his speed in time . Instead he slammed festively into the family group , grabbing hold of the big guy , intending to use him as an anchor to bring himself into orbit . But Dad 's new weight was n't up to the task . Lighter than of old , too , the man swung off-balance on Artie 's impact . Only Artie 's adept recovery kept them from crashing to the pavement . " Ya got ta protect me . Pop . Yer daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Rachel was upon them already , adding her own momentum to the human pileup . Forgetting her original target at her first glance at Dad , she released her hold on Artie and grabbed the other man 's body . She wrapped her thumb and little finger around Pop 's wrist . Their tips joined easily . Her astonished face rose up , scolding , " Biafra ! " Dad laughed . His hat  --  a farmer 's visor cap bearing De Kalb insignia , a winged , flying ear of corn for which he had frequently delivered Freudian interpretations  --  jarred loose in the collision . Rach reached up to right it , but Pop drew back and fixed it himself with a speed and severity that surprised the whole group . The little borrowed piece of pavement outside Woolworth 's filled with mutual knowledge : each knew what that hat failed to cover up . Rach and Artie saw their suspicions  | ratified in their mother 's eyes . All they could do was chalk up another symptom on the list . Somehow , overnight , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . Pop 's parts began to shed in a waterfall in front of them . Unable to dam the flow , each picked a spot on their gloves to inspect . At last , the man who had created the moment of shared shame broke it . " Proceed directly to Christmas windows . Do not pass Go , do not address outstanding business . " Artie heard the voice of reason insist : Good Christ , how can we be going through with this ? But he had no confidence in the practical support he would get from the others if he objected . Besides : what could another hour hurt ? So Dad got away again , for one last afternoon . As this was his baby  --  the Platonic ghost of a child 's remembered Christmas on Fifth Avenue a half-century ago  --  Eddie Sr. took charge , towing Ailene and the haplotypes along in his wake . They formed , against their separate wills , an **26;400;TOOLONG parade through the indifferent , purchasing crowd . Eddie Jr . brought up the rear guard , whining , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , counting windchill . We got ta stop this Christmas noise and get indoors . " The mid-December temperature had taken a perverse turn downward toward bleak midwinter . But in Eddie 's begging was also that old romance of the dangerous cold . He beat his hands together and laughed , unable to feel his fingers . He gave in to giddiness , wondering if he would make it to the next shelter . He found himself agreeing with the bearish thermometer : something remarkable was about to happen . Artie dropped back into step next to his kid brother , wondering what to say to a guy like Little Eddie . " So , kid . How was T-Day ? " Artie 's unsponsored memory offered : T-1 , T-2 , T-3 . When did you hit the beach ? On T plus 3 . " Sorry I , uh , crapped out on you , " he added , taking up the slack . " Thanksgiving ? S'allright . Hey ! Remember that guy on . . . what the hell show was that ? All right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that ? That show had been canned for years by the time you were conscious . I tell you : my generation might have its brains stuffed with half-hour scripts , but at least they 're the real thing and not reruns . " " Hey . Blow , all right ? "  | " S'allright . " " Anyway , Thanksgiving was okay . White meat a little dry . Some calamity over Mom dropping a mincemeat pie on the kitchen floor . Ca n't remember . Seems like such a long time ago . " Eddie let his voice trail off in Gothic parody . " Dig for it , buddy . It 's all there . You can tell me . You 're blocking . " " Well . . . your father had an interesting story or two , as you can imagine . Guy reads too much . Would n't have half the problems he does if he 'd just lay off the capital-L literature . " Eddie borrowed a nervous habit from his brother and pinched the bridge of his nose . He unconsciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by copying one of their physical mannerisms . With Dad , he winced . " Everything was fine . The Cowboys won . The usual . And your mother 's bird stuffing ... " " ... makes up for a multitude of sins , " Artie supplied . " Yeah . " At a commanding glance from the ringleader , the two of them brought themselves back into the column . They exchanged a quick , quizzical , unseen , misunderstood look . The slight tightening about one another 's mouths triggered both boys to recall , in differing versions , that old favorite pedagogical chestnut of Pop 's : Sometimes we need coaxing to act on our own . Marshall Field 's , traditionally the most extravagant of the window dressers , was the family 's first stop . Field 's theme this year was " Christmas ' Through the Decades , " an elaborate , multiwindow display dug out of mothballs and restored to the splendor of all its elaborate moving parts . Each box of plate glass became a diorama devoted to its own ten-year period : Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Rach commented . " They just pull it out every ten years , drop the oldest number , add a new one at the other end , and bingo . Ready-made nostalgia . " An unlikely assortment of decidedly contemporary people milled about history 's windows . One exhibit was mobbed by a local television-news crew documenting the antique display as viewed by the contemporary audience . The crowd formed that magic toadstool ring that invariably collects around any video camera and microphone , the mere presence of broadcast electronics turning the banal into news . The TV team roared  | with satisfaction as kids with bits of crap around their mouths stopped in front of the older decades , saying , " What 's with the funny hats ? " or , " Why are all the streetlights on fire ? " The windows followed chronological order , south to north . Artie suggested under his breath to his brother , " Notice the layout ? Up from the slums toward the Gold Coast . Every day in every way , things are getting better and better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the irony . A gang of materially blessed kids from Lincolnwood skipped from time portal to time portal , stopping to enumerate the milestones of progress each one marked : " Now they 've got cars . Now they 're getting fun presents , with batteries . " The double edge of the time line cut Artie until he could no longer stand it . Here they were , kept alive by the sight of their own past artificially preserved behind plate glass , waiting for the eternally improving future to bail them out of an obviously untenable present . For the first time since age twelve , he ran to his parents ' side , although their protective spell had long ago deserted them . At the sight of the moving parts  --  the butcher raising the killed goose by its neck , the man tipping his stovepipe hat to the pretty woman curtsying in cummerbund , the rocking horse , the sledders in stocking caps  --  Mom and Dad departed together into memory . " I remember my mother telling me about those kind of stoves . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house I lived in , in Teaneck , had a fireplace exactly like that . " Artie , calmed by the catalog of inconsequences , dropped back to take the decades at his own pace . In front of 1900 , an intimate interior of a living room with candletrimmed tree as yet untouched by Ludlow , Lowell , Lawrence , or the Triangle Shirt Factory Fire , where a handlebar-mustachioed father read to several wide-eyed children decked out by the fire while mother sneaked about behind their backs , planting presents , Rach accosted Lily . " Admit it , " she said . " Admit what ? " Lily demurred . " Do n't give me that . Just admit it . " " I do n't have the foggiest idea what you 're talking about . Admit what ? " In answer , Young Sister simply pointed to the porcelain-modeled mother , toy-bedecked , coming from the pantry with its icebox , grinder ,  | and spices hanging from the ceiling . " That 's you , is n't it ? Taking our time with this decade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is she ? " Lily tried to brush her tormentor off , but refused to use her hands . Instead , she shoved her hips against her antagonist 's hips and slammed her shoulders against Rach 's , but kept her hands folded over in front of her , the chance of leprosy too great to risk pushing away persecution with bare skin . Rach persisted , " That 's you . Admit it , " while Lily , selfstraight-jacketed , struggled against her , voicing vowels . A small altercation in the greater conflict all around them . Artie came to the rescue . " What seems to be the trouble here , ladies ? " Lily came and snuggled against him , turning her back against Rachel , closing her sister out . She kept her arms crossed , but pressed her head and winter-coated torso against him . She reminded Artie of one of those Raggedy Ann dolls whose arms are permanently sewn together . Her posture  --  armadillo ball  --  irritated him , one of those affectations of posture that he hated most about his sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered her body contact in silence , neither recoiling nor reciprocating . Her face still pressing her brother 's heavy coat , Lily asked , " Artie , how much do you know about the project ? " " What project is that , Mrs. Leeds ? The TVA ? " " You know what I mean . " Her voiced flashed a sudden undercurrent of violence . " Pop 's project . Hobstown . " Artie nodded , but said nothing . " For some reason , " she continued unnecessarily , " I picture it like this . " She stretched her neck out toward Christmas in 1900 , still in her protective posture-ball . Banned from the club , Rach hovered behind them . She leveled her own opinion of Hobstown . " It cai n't be anythin ' lahk this . That 's just wishful thinkin ' , honey-chile . " Lily defended herself without turning around to acknowledge . " Not like this one . Like the whole series . All the windows at once . Taken as an entirety . " Neither sib said anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher , after all . " " Was , " corrected Artie , and instantly hated himself . Here , in the unforgiving minute , the woman put herself on the line and all he could
