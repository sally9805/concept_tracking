A few weeks ago , Braniff sprang a surprise on some of its airline rivals : It slashed prices for off-peak travel in 43 markets . The very next day , Continental Airlines struck back . Irked that some of the Braniff cuts were aimed at its Houston hub , Continental , a unit of Texas Air Corp. , retaliated by cutting selected fares out of Kansas City  --  Braniff ' s home turf . Last Thursday , Braniff caved in under the pressure . The unit of BIA-COR Holdings Inc. ended its special discounts . Even though coast-to-coast fare wars have abated in recent years , airlines still do daily battle . These skirmishes take place in the electronic tariff system that airlines have been using since deregulation to issue the fare changes seen by travel agents in their computer-reservation systems . Such price changes usually appear in the tariff system one day after they ' ve been issued . Over the years , airlines have become more and more sophisticated at using the tariff system to play complicated cat-and-mouse games . In making moves and countermoves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For instance , if one carrier introduces a new low fare , others might signal their displeasure by matching the new fare for only one or two days  --  a sign that they would like to see the fare brought to a quick end . If that doesn ' t work , they might take more drastic measures , cutting selected fares on some of the instigator ' s most profitable routes . Since many of these cuts happen so fast , and for such short duration , consumers and even travel agents sometimes don ' t have time to find out about them before they ' re discontinued . Some critics of the industry have expressed concern about these electronic behind-the-scenes battles . One worry is that large carriers could use the system to inflict great damage on smaller airlines  --  undercutting their ability to expand into new markets and blocking them from offering fares that are out of step with the majors . Another concern is that instead of fighting each other , carriers could use their electronic signaling to set anti-competitive prices . At the moment , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be territorial  --  airlines defending their hubs against attempted inroads by other carriers . " Airlines are protecting their turf , " says Frank Borman , former chairman of Eastern Airlines . " The hubs are in intense competition with each other . " Adds Jack Hunter , an industry analyst at Howe Barnes Investments Inc. in Chicago : " That ' s the airline business today : You stick it to me , I ' ll stick it to you . You come into my back yard , I ' ll hit you in yours . " But others contend that the major airlines ' activities are already more sinister than that . " This represents price fixing at its worst , " contends Republican Sen. Larry Pressler of South Dakota . " There are very vicious games being played . " A few weeks ago , one of these battles was played out after Midway Airlines Inc. decided to introduce jet service out of Milwaukee . A detailed look at what happened reveals how carriers use their computer software to carry out their warfare and why some might find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pricing executives , analysis of the electronic tariff system and confirmation by the airlines involved . The only participant that wouldn ' t discuss what happened was Northwest Airlines , a unit of NWA Inc . MONDAY , MAY 1 : Seizing on an opportunity for expansion , Midway Airlines begins offering jet service from Milwaukee to its base at Chicago ' s Midway Airport . Midway has decided that now is a good time to make the move because Northwest Airlines , the carrier with the biggest presence in Milwaukee , has been recently showing signs of complacency . In the past year , Northwest was aggressive about expanding service out of Milwaukee . But now it appears content to stick with the status quo . Midway ' s move , in fact , coincides with a scheduled cutback in Northwest service to a number of cities . THURSDAY , JUNE 8 : To attract more attention to its new service , Midway cuts fares on its five Milwaukee flights  --  not only to and from Chicago but also on connecting service to 45 other cities . The reductions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range from $40 to $210 round-trip . For instance , the least expensive Milwaukee-Boston fare is reduced to $148 round-trip from $198 . Midway schedules the promotional fares to take effect tomorrow , June 9 , and expire Aug. 1  --  for travel no later than Sept. 11 . FRIDAY , JUNE 9 : Reacting swiftly , United Airlines and Trans World Airlines both match Midway ' s promotional fares out of Milwaukee on competitive routes . United , however , only matches the Midway fare for a few days  --  a signal that it doesn ' t approve of this pricing action . TUESDAY , JUNE 13 : Northwest strikes back . It not only matches Midway fares out of Milwaukee but also lowers ticket prices in six round-trip markets out of Midway Airport , including New York , Los Angeles and Washington , D.C. The Los **25;470;TOOLONG price is now $168 round-trip , compared with $258 previously . To airline pricing executives , Northwest ' s message to Midway is clear : Mess with our hub and we will mess with yours . WEDNESDAY , JUNE 14 : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airport . Although Northwest originally had intended to strike back only at Midway Airlines , carriers operating out of O ' Hare feel threatened by the new low prices customers can get at Midway Airport . After all , why pay $238 to fly round-trip between O ' Hare and New York when flights out of Midway now cost $148 ? United thus cuts prices out of O ' Hare . But to show its strong displeasure at Northwest , it initially does so for only two days . United is even more emphatic . To make sure its point is clear , it also cuts prices for two days on a number of flights out of Minneapolis/St . Paul International Airport . This is sacred ground  --  the home headquarters of Northwest . THURSDAY , JUNE 15 : Northwest retreats , but only slightly . It reduces by one month the amount of time its new fares out of Midway are to last , setting a new expiration date of June 30 . Northwest also matches United ' s O ' Hare fare cuts for one day . Today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at O ' Hare and in Minneapolis to match the moves by United and Northwest . FRIDAY , JUNE 16 : Despite the " help " it has received from United and American , Midway offers a concession . Picking up on the timing suggested in Northwest ' s move the day before , Midway scales back the duration of its Milwaukee promotional fares to June 30 from Aug. 1 . Midway gives in , in part , because it is feeling the pinch from the Northwest fare cuts at its hub at Midway airport . At first , the smaller carrier had tried to get by without matching these low fares , but it eventually had been faced with the choice of falling in line or losing customers . Meanwhile , the bigger carriers remain in a standoff on a number of their other retaliatory fares , and no one seems to want to blink first . United , American and Northwest all extend various fare cuts until Wednesday , June 21 . MONDAY , JUNE 19 : The clearest sign of a truce comes today as Northwest agrees to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of Milwaukee as of June 30 . United immediately follows ; and in the next few days , American , Northwest and Midway all announce plans to return to pre-skirmish fare levels in Minneapolis , Chicago and Milwaukee as of June 30 . FRIDAY , JUNE 30 : The Midway promotional fares end in Milwaukee . Midway considers the promotion a success  --  despite the hits it had to take on other fares because of the fare cutting by the other carriers . During the time the fares are in effect , compared with the month before , Midway doubles the number of seats sold on flights between Milwaukee and Chicago ' s Midway airport . Midway is continuing to operate five daily flights out of Milwaukee . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
