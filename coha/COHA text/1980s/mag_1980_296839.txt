Hurt by the recession , the G.O.P. ' s host is fighting back <P> It 's a lunch-bucket town with a world-class symphony . A heavily black city with a black-run government , but an economy dependent on white business leaders . A community that prides itself on its race relations , yet a town where the underlying tensions could still cause another riot . And it 's a Democratic town holding the Republican National Convention . <P> With its many contradictions , Detroit defies labeling and upsets preconceptions . Self-styled sophisticates from elsewhere have long scoffed at the industrial city . Just last week a researcher from one of the television networks had the gall to ask a Detroit spokesman to help put together a list of a dozen " top mugging spots " for convention delegates to avoid . Actually , crime in the city has dropped dramatically in the past few years . And a European reporter who assumed the Detroit River was hopelessly polluted by the city 's heavy industry looked out over the waterfront in astonishment at fishermen angling for coho salmon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Detroit this week during the four-day Republican Convention . Some 15,000 journalists will jostle with 4,000 delegates and alternates in and around the just finished $27 million Joe Louis Arena , where Ronald Reagan will become the Republicans ' presidential candidate . The crowds are overwhelming Detroit 's limited hotel and eating facilities ; some conventioneers are staying across the border in Canada , or up to 40 miles away in small towns of Michigan . <P> Both Detroit and the G.O.P. are out to exploit each other , and make no bones about it . Coleman A. Young , Detroit 's shrewd and aggressive mayor , hopes to use the convention to prove to the nation that his town is , as its boosters have been boasting , a city in the midst of a revival . He is well aware of the risk in seizing the national spotlight , if only for a week . " We have our warts , " Young says with typical candor , " and we see them too . " Republican Party leaders , in turn , hope to use Detroit as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blacks away from the Democratic Party . <P> Some of Detroit 's warts were highly visible last week . Even as parking-lot operators were putting out potted geraniums to brighten the city 's face for visitors , some 425 striking sanitation workers let garbage pile up along the streets . Bus mechanics , too , were on strike , forcing the collapse of local service that carries 200,000 people daily-although some residents claim the system has long been so poor that no one can tell the difference . In all , about 8,400 striking municipal workers ( out of 21,700 ) tried to use the convention as a club to beat the city into granting hefty wage hikes . Young , who came out of the same tough " Black Bottom " ghetto that produced Joe Louis and was once an organizer for the United Auto Workers , bargained hard but at week 's end settled for a draw . A new pact gave the workers less than they had asked but more than the mayor had offered-despite Young 's repeated plea that " I ai n't got no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
