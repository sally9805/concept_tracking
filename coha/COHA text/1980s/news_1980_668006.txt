By Monday night I was bored with it . By Tuesday I was starting to become angry . And by Wednesday I was wondering if I would find anybody else who shared my opinion of the celebrated officiating call in the Houston-Pittsburgh AFC championship game . This may qualify as a radical view , but I don ' t think it made a damn bit of difference whether Mike Renfro was in bounds or out of bounds when he caught Dan Pastorini ' s 6-yard pass or whether he was juggling the ball or holding it with the force of seven jars of Elmer ' s Glue . All I know is that justice , as I see it , was served . And I define justice as the best team winning a fair game . I mean , doesn ' t anybody care that Pittsburgh did a lot of great things ( such as holding the game ' s best runner to 15 yards in 17 carries ) in that game , and that , given their long history of playing well under pressure , they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renfro ' s touchdown would have represented ? For anyone to suggest that Houston was somehow " robbed " is to risk an automatic appointment with a psychiatrist . And yet what did we read about in the days following the game ? Did we read about the phenomenal Pittsburgh defense ? Did we read about the marvelous Terry Bradshaw ? Did we read about the gallant Oilers , who had done so well just to reach the AFC finals and who had displayed true class in every way , from the coaching of Bum Phillips to the outstanding play of many individual players ? No . We read about replays . I think the world functioned better without replays . Surely there must have been as many dubious and/or difficult calls to make prior to the invention of the replay ( not to mention the " isolated replay " ) 15 years ago . There were controversial plays involving officiating decisions in the days of yore , but most of them had to do with lapses of judgment ( such as the Fifth Down Touchdown scored by Cornell against Dartmouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , rather than Blowing The Call , per se . When these things happened , people shrugged their shoulders and went about their business . It was left for the modern generation to demand that the games not just be played well and be handled fairly by the officials . Now nothing short of empirical evidence will suffice . No World Series , Super Bowl or bowl game is complete without thorough scrutiny of some " key " play , leading to the inevitable request to implement instant replays as officiating tools . That ' s just what we need , all right , the introduction of a device which would not only slow down the conduct of the game but which , in many instances , would only further confuse or aggravate the principals . That the present equipment is often inadequate was again demonstrated by the Renfro incident , which degenerated into a pathetic " **36;34;TOOLONG ! " name-calling thing between NBC and the NFL Films people . It wasn ' t until Wednesday that something was produced which clarified the matter in my mind , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The whole thing was so irrelevant . What ' s not irrelevant is this frightening obsession with accuracy . I believe the desire to electronify sports officiating is nothing short of sick . My God , we are still talking about sports , are we not ? I don ' t care how much money is at stake , the activity is still a game and I believe it ' s vital that we retain a human touch . I want officials to take their jobs seriously . They should come prepared and they should work as hard as humanly possible in order to best discharge their duties . A little humility wouldn ' t hurt , either , and perhaps some of them should be quicker to realize that they aren ' t very good at it . There would be no disgrace involved , because anyone with any sense realizes it ' s a very hard job . I ' m not saying that officials don ' t affect games , but I do know that the number directly altered is very small and that the Houston- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m ashamed to say that sportswriters and sports editors have become increasingly attracted to trivialization and coverage of non-issues ( Another great example : " Will Larry Bird speak to us at the NCAAs ? " ) at the expense of the actual competition . Enough already . Pittsburgh , which was the better team and deserved to win , is in the Super Bowl . Nothing else matters. *
