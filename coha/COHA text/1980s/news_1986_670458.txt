The lopsided character of American-Chinese exchanges of scientific information was brought home to 14 American chemists who concluded an exchange visit to China this month . Dazzled by China ' s scenic wonders and sumptuous cuisine , the Americans were nevertheless left wondering if they had learned anything of substance in exchange for the professional insights they had offered to their Chinese hosts. // In their two-week visit , delegates from the American Institute of Chemists presented talks and research material based on their specialties , some of which were linked to industrial and military technologies vital to Chinese interests . The men and women in the group also brought money for a fund that subsidizes some of the 30 , 000 Chinese scientists and students China has sent abroad to learn from the West. // At the conclusion of their trip , the Americans professed themselves amply rewarded by the chance to tour China , but most also lamented the fact that the scientific exchange had been essentially a one-way transaction . Their experience appears to have been shared by many of the American scientific missions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Technology // Dr. Philip H. Abelson , an organizer of the first delegation sent to China by the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1978 , believes that one reason for the inaccessibility of such information is the relative backwardness of Chinese technology. // " The Chinese don ' t have all that much to show , and they are naturally reticent about exposing their shortcomings , " he said . " Ideological resistance to disclosing privileged information appears to be declining , but it ' s still a factor . On top of all that , China has always had a negative attitude toward foreigners , and attitudes can not be changed as easily as switching off a light. " // Dr. Abelson added , " I would consider making another trip to China myself only if really substantive information were to become available from the Chinese. " // A contrasting explanation for Chinese reticence was offered by William W. Havens , executive secretary of the American Physical Society. // " One-on-one relationships between American and Chinese physicists are generally very productive of results in the pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Havens said in an interview . " However , some of our applied-science people have been frustrated in their desire to get a glimpse of Chinese industrial processes - those involving advanced lasers , for example - but the Chinese don ' t structure exchanges in such a way as to allow such glimpses . In fairness , of course , it ' s hard to imagine an American company like I.B.M. allowing outsiders to see its proprietary processes . " <> <> Contrast in Approaches // Still , American openness contrasts sharply with Chinese secrecy in many aspects of the scientific relations between the two countries . Space technology is typical . Although Chinese officials and experts have been given significant access to the technology underlying American space programs , the gesture does not appear to have been reciprocal . A large delegation of Chinese space officials invited to Cape Canaveral , Fla. , witnessed the destruction of the space shuttle Challenger last Jan. 28 , but to date , no American observers have been permitted to watch a launching from the new rocket pad in western China. // As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAST ) , the American chemists who visited China this month were treated to some of the most spectacular sights in China - the Great Wall , the picturesque sugarloaf mountains of Guilin , the archeological wonders of Xian , and ancient parks , pagodas and palaces of Peking , Canton and Shanghai . They visited a collective farm and exchanged innumerable toasts with Chinese officials at a series of banquets . The chemists also saw some tantalizing intimations of advanced Chinese technology. // One of the American delegates was Dr. Abraham L. Landis , a senior scientist at the Hughes Aircraft Company in El Segundo , Calif. , who had needed special permission from his employer , a military contractor , to discuss technology with Chinese counterparts . Dr. Landis ' s specialty is a class of plastics called called polyimides , which remain extremely strong even at high temperatures , and therefore have important applications in space and advanced electronics. // Speaking before an audience of about 20 Chinese chemists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Peking , he briefly summarized the chemistry and applications of polyimides in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Prof. Lu Feng-Cai , a scientist whose son is a graduate student in the United States . After describing some of the quantum-mechanical calculations that the Chinese team had used in developing advanced polymers , Dr. Lu showed Dr. Landis a perfectly formed polyimide ring with characteristics that might have suited it for use as a bearing or machine part of some kind . <> <> American Is Surprised // " I had expected the Chinese to have read up the chemical literature on polyimides , " Dr. Landis said , " but I was unprepared for that sample of molded polyimide , which graphically demonstrated to me the extent to which Chinese technology has advanced . And as for Dr. Lu , I can only say that if I had been in China as a student it would have been a privilege to have had her as a teacher. " // But the Americans were accorded little more than glimpses . Dr. Rodney Lu-dai Sung of Fishkill , N.Y. , a Chinese-born gasoline chemist at Texaco Inc. , spent an entire day briefing Chinese petroleum experts on gasoline additives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollutants and keep engines clean. // " They seemed insatiable for knowledge , " he said , " and it became clear to me that although China is a major gasoline producer , the Chinese know next to nothing about chemical additives. " // But Dr. Sung , who holds scores of patents for various gasoline additives , got little in return ; his requests to visit a refinery or petroleum laboratory were ignored. // In Peking and Canton , John D. Galligan , a vice president for research and development at the Gillette Company in Boston , described advanced processes for depositing ultra-hard ceramic coatings on the edges of razor blades and on the ball tips of ballpoint pens . The processes have important potential applications in metallurgy , including the weapons production. // But although Mr. Galligan ' s slides and diagrams had been prepared with Chinese titles , his audiences neither commented upon nor questioned his presentation , and it was impossible to discern how much had been absorbed. // " One of the frustrating things , " said another of the scientists , " was the almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another : " Going to China for a scientific exchange was a great experience for all of us . But it ' s one I ' m not personally anxious to repeat. " //
