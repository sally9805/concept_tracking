Nearly 20 years after the release of his ground-breaking movie " Medium Cool , " cinematographer Haskell Wexler is back with another film that threatens to provoke lots of heated discussion . Wexler believes that the unyielding political position of his movie " Latino , " which concerns American foreign policy toward Nicaragua , has prevented him from finding a major film studio to distribute the film to theaters in the United States . A distribution deal has been signed  --  but not with one of the major studios . In Europe , " Latino " has had a distributor  --  but remains unreleased  --  since its screening at last May ' s Cannes Film Festival . Wexler believes there might be forces here and abroad that would like to see the film just disappear . The film was shown as part of the Chicago International Film Festival and will open Friday at the Fine Arts theaters . A two-time Academy Award winner for cinematography ( " Who ' s Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? " and " Bound for Glory " ) , Wexler is revered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work inside and outside the industry . His lesser-known works include the controversial " Introduction to the Enemy , " shot in North Vietnam in the early ' 70s with his former activist associate , Jane Fonda . His " Medium Cool " dealt with a Chicago TV cameraman at the tumultuous Democratic National Convention in 1968 . The cameraman becomes alienated from his work when he realizes that the station he works for is releasing its news film for FBI and CIA inspection . He later gets involved with an Appalachian widow who lives with her son in Uptown . Wexler also was associated with Emile de Antonio ' s documentary " Underground , " about ' 60s radical Weathermen fugitives , and the Oscar- winning " Interviews with My Lai Veterans . " Wexler , a thin , white-haired man of 60 , comes from a prominent Chicago family ( his brothers are real estate magnate Jerrold and Yale , who operates hotels and has worked in many film and theater projects ; his mother , Lottie , helped finance post-production work for " Latino " ) . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political Wexler . The British film journal Sight and Sound found the movie to be one-sided and thus less effective than it could have been . A review in the trade paper Variety also derided the film for its slant in favor of the present Nicaraguan government , but a Hollywood Reporter review called Wexler ' s movie a strong statement and a success . " Latino ' s " premise comes from its main character , a young Chicano named Eddie Guerrero ( the last name translates into " warrior " ) who served as a Green Beret in Vietnam and now has made the armed forces a career . Guerrero ( Robert Beltran ) is selected along with another East Los Angeles friend to be air-lifted into Honduras to train the U.S.-supported anti-Sandinista contra forces in Nicaragua . Wexler then shows how Guerrero reacts when he is ordered to fight people who look like him , speak Spanish like him and eat tortillas just like his mom makes back home . Eventually , he questions the American foreign policy that has sent him to Honduras . Wexler recalls that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided facilities but none of the financing for the $4 million picture ) took the film around to all the major distribution companies . It was uniformly rejected by all of them . " For Wexler , it was a case of multinational corporations fearing adverse reaction of stockholders and others to a film considered as " anti-Reagan foreign policy . " Several studio spokesman , however , later said that they had rejected the film simply because they questioned its commercial viability . Standing to stretch and pause for a cold glass of orange juice , Wexler ' s lean , almost emaciated , figure recalls Ray Bolger ' s scarecrow . His cadaverous gaze gives an almost hypnotic stare to his eyes ( which disappears when he puts on his glasses ) as his attention was drawn to a French one-sheet poster of Godard ' s " Je Vous Salue , Marie " ( " Hail Mary " ) . He managed a weak smile . Godard , after all , has been an inspiration for him , even to the point that the ending of " Medium Cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Contempt . ' " Yet Godard ' s new film had been publicly denounced by Pope John Paul II himself , causing a ban and withdrawal of the film from distribution in European cities and even prompting Godard to issue a statement in deference to the Pope . Wexler himself senses that the same thing might happen to " Latino . " The 1983 Los Angles Filmex festival devoted an afternoon to a program called " Nicaragua Now ! "  --  films about and from the Sandinista movement . Wexler had gone to Nicaragua and filmed " Target : Nicaragua " for his friend Saul Landau . It was described as a report on the covert war being carried out by the CIA against the Sandinista government of Nicaragua . At the time , the thought had already entered Wexler ' s mind to make a feature film that would reflect his feelings about the political situation there . " When I began working on ' Latino , ' I was interested in the whole subject of surrogate warfare and how some of the lessons of Vietnam were learned by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wexler recalled . " I decided to make a dramatic film dealing with the subject . I ' m aware of the fact that no one really pays too much attention to documentaries or professional opinions these days , particulary on U.S. televison . " I tried to get George Lucas to put up money and he declined ; but then before we went to shoot , he said he would finance post-production , which was a serious and good contribution . He never commented on politics . George is interested in having a good story that reaches the widest audience . . . . A lot of his suggestions were for clarity , for spelling things out : ' People don ' t know where the hell Central America is . You have to tell them . You say the word contra but they don ' t know what that is . ' But I also listened to him . I ' ve known him since he was a kid , and I talk to him like his mentor , the elder person I felt I was . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early February 1984 and lasted 16 weeks . Some of " Latino " was filmed in combat zones near the Honduras border , where much of the contra activity has been based . Wexler said his production crew paid for everything  --  the Nicaraguan government stayed out . " I didn ' t want anyone to think we were propagandists for one side of the war . " " We arranged explosives to blow up the grain silos and spent the day shooting the scene , " said Tom Sigel , the director of photography , " And when we woke up the next morning , we found out that similar silos had been blown up by the contras on the northern border . It was like they were reading the script . " Realism has long been a staple in Wexler ' s brand of cinema verite . Viewers of Wexler ' s " Medium Cool " probably still recall the actual danger recorded accidentally when an off-screen voice yells , " Watch out , Haskell , it ' s real ! " Wexler ' s camera was caught in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a National Guardsman . Wexler wanted to bring a similar authenticity to " Latino . " The production crew that he gathered was familiar with the war zone . Sigel has a reputation for courting danger in order to get a story . Along with his partner , Pamela Yates , the movie ' s sound techincian , they are established documentary film makers with " When the Mountains Tremble , " about Guatemala , and " Nicaragua : Report From the Front " among their more recent works . " Pam and Tom spent two weeks with the contras , " Wexler said . " Subsequently , they received death threats against them in New York and had to move and change their phone because the contras later realized that the material was used to expose them . " While Wexler ' s " Latino " is bound to provoke discussion , it may anger some viewers as well . One scene involves the capture of a young supporter of the Sandinista government by the contras and their U.S. advisers . He is forced into a stinking hellhole and later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wexler believes , is counter the Reagan administration ' s long-held contention that young Nicaraguans are forced into servitude by the Sandinistas while others eagerly volunteer to fight with the contras . In " Latino , " however , Wexler has pushed back the newsreel documentary reportage in order to focus on Guerrero ' s eyewitness account , which is nevertheless based on facts and occurences gleaned from the controversial CIA manual among other sources , or so says Wexler . " I don ' t think that more facts would have any influence on the American people , but through fiction one can impact a wider audience . American people have attitudes and proclivities toward fairness and equality as reflected by our historical traditions . If given the facts , they will respond in a non- military , sympathetic way .
