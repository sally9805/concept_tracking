In the last year that United Press International made money , Lyndon Johnson was in the White House and the Beatles ' A Hard Day 's Night was climbing the 1964 record charts . Last week brought more bad news for the second largest U.S. wire service , which emerged from bankruptcy proceedings last June when it was bought by Mexican Newspaper Publisher Mario Vazquez Rana . The New York Times revealed that on Dec. 31 it would cancel its basic contract with U.P.I. ( The Times still wants to use the wire 's photo service . ) Estimated cost of the dropped service : close to $1 million a year . The paper apparently aims to bolster its New York Times News Service , one of U.P.I. 's competitors . <P> Newspaper executives have traditionally supported U.P.I. as the main source of competition for the Associated Press , the nation 's No. 1 wire service . But a few more major customer defections could deal the final blow to the struggling runner-up .               @ @ @ @ @ @
