HOUSTON  --  Gordon Jewelry Corp. , one of only two publicly held jewelry chains left in the U.S. , said it is exploring the possible sale of the company . But industry observers and Wall Street analysts said that any offer for the company would be almost certainly unsolicited . The Gordon family has wielded tight-fisted control of the company for years , and family members currently hold about 40% of the company ' s roughly 8. 4 million shares outstanding . Moreover , in the last few years , a younger generation of Gordon family members has taken charge of the chain and launched a costly renovation of its stores throughout the country . The prevailing view is that the Gordon family is strongly committed to maintaining its independence . " I doubt that they ' re soliciting an offer because the family is keen on maintaining control of the business , " said Michael Lavington , president and chief operating officer of Kay Jewelers Inc. , the U.S. ' s only other publicly traded independent chain . " And they ' ve been doing a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re committed to the business . " Gordon family members didn ' t return phone calls . But in a statement , the company said it is exploring a number of alternatives ranging from a recapitalization to a stock buy-back to a " sale to a third party . " Daniel Gordon , president , cautioned that " there could be no assurance that a transaction would take place . " But Wall Street acted as if a pending transaction was a fait accompli . Yesterday , in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Gordon Class A shares surged $5. 125 to close at $24 on volume of 90 , 100 shares . Gordon ' s stock has traded briskly in recent weeks . About 25% is held by institutions . The U.S. jewelry industry has been marked by frenetic acquisition activity of late , and most of the interest has come from overseas . In the last few years , Peoples Jewellers Ltd. of Ontario acquired Zale Corp . Ratners Group PLC , based in London , recently acquired Sterling Inc. , an Akron , Ohio-based chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other closely held U.S.-based jewelers through its Sterling subsidiary . And Hooker Corp. , an Australian land development company , recently acquired a Sacramento , Calif. - based jewelry chain . The reason for all the foreign interest in domestic jewelers ? " There ' s a growing realization that the jewelry industry is very profitable to be in because of favorable demographics , " said Kay ' s Mr. Lavington . The typical jewelry story customer , he said , is fairly young and affluent , earning $20 , 000 or more annually . And foreign investors are aware that this group is growing faster than the U.S. population . Until recently , Gordon , the nation ' s second largest jewelry chain in terms of sales , had been one of the ugly ducklings of the jewelry trade . Gordon ' s stores , most of which were in the depressed oil producing states of Texas , Oklahoma and Louisiana , had a tacky and tarnished appearance . And Gordon ' s bottom line reflected its sagging image . In fiscal 1988 , Gordon had a $14 million loss on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had a loss of $19. 2 million on sales of $388. 9 million . But a chainwide modernization project , involving the remodeling of more than 400 stores and the closing of many unprofitable outlets , is just now starting to pay off . Gordon had profit of $17. 3 million on sales of $221. 4 million for the six months ended Feb. 28 . The profit included a pretax gain of $3. 7 million from the sale of assets . In a recent interview , Mr. Gordon said the company has upgraded and expanded its line of merchandise , moved aggressively into mall locations and , as a result , is now attracting a younger , more upscale patron . " We ' re still going after the customer earning $18 , 000 to $20 , 000 a year , " Mr. Gordon said , " but we ' re making a more concerted effort now to capture the $60 , 000 to $100 , 000 customer . " And , he added with a smile , " We ' re getting them , thank you . " Credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
