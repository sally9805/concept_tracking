THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment AFRIEND who lives in a one-room apartment off Columbus Avenue writes ; One of the appealing features of my apartment  --  perhaps the appealing feature  --  is a fireplace ( with a handsome wooden mantel ) , although my landlord instructed me never to make a fire in it , lest I ignite the upper West Side . I have obeyed . One day last winter when it was very cold in my apartment , it occurred to me that Con Edison 's expensive electric heat was perhaps moving in an uninterrupted thermal pattern from private ownership up the chimney to the public sector , so I got down on all fours on the hearth and peered up in search of a damper I might close . I did n't see any . I did see a little gray sky . I crumpled up a lot of old newspapers and stuffed them into the chimney to seal it . Getting to my feet , I began to dust myself off , and found that the grime and soot on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shoes would not dust off . It clung , as if alive . It had lumps in it , and webby stuff ; some of it was cinders , and some of it was blobs of oil . All of it was black . Its main characteristic was the way it adhered . I washed my hands and face with soap , then Comet cleanser , then Mr. Clean . The hands and face came out O.K. , but the sink turned black . I tried scrubbing the sink , but the gunk stuck to the scrub brush , except when I tried to scrub something else , and then a lot of it came off and stuck to that . A modicum of cleanliness was finally achieved  --  clothes went to the cleaners and the laundromat  --  and I forgot about the fireplace until yesterday afternoon , when I entered the apartment to find that the crumpled newspapers that had been in the chimney were now in various corners of the room and on the bed . From the fireplace itself was extruding what appeared to be a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adjacent rug , and most of the floor beyond . A thin layer of fallout had settled on chairs , desk , bed , clothes , tables , television , books , and lampshades . The black stuff contained small chunks of brick and cement as well as the familiar petrochemicals . I spent an hour trying to clean up , using broom , brush , dustpan , water , sponge , mop , Comet , Mr. Clean , bath towels , paper towels , and an old shirt ; results were slim . ( The mopping , for example , was basically unsuccessful because once the swabbed area dried there appeared on the periphery a heavy black outline , like a high-tide mark . Scrubbing at that only moved the tide line somewhere else . ) I gave up , went out , and ran into the landlord on the stairs . He was wild-eyed and covered with soot , and was clutching a camera . All the apartments were in the same condition as mine , he explained in a trembling voice . Men working on the tenement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy condominium ? had demolished not only the tenement 's chimneys but our building 's chimneys as well . The brick and concrete had descended , like Santa Claus , thoroughly cleaning all the chimneys on the way down . " I 'm going to sue ! " he exclaimed . " I 'm taking pictures of everything ! " I wished him well , and went to the hardware store to check on late developments in heavy-duty cleansers . ? ? Visitors E had the honor of being visited the other day by Ai Qing , Wang Meng , and Feng Yidai , of the Peo-ple 's Republic of China . Ai Qing , aged seventy , is one of China 's pre  --  mi-nent poets and the vice-chairman of the Chinese Writers ' Association . Wang Meng , forty-six , is a renowned novelist and short-story writer and the vice-chairman of the Peking branch of the Writers ' Association . Feng Yidai , sixty-seven , is one of his country 's lead-ing translators of English-language literature and the editor of the journal Reading . All had recently arrived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and there under the auspices of this country 's International Com-munication Agency , the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa , and the Translation Center at Columbia University . Feng Yidai is fluent in English , naturally , and he volunteered to interpret for his compatriots . Ai Qing speaks French , having spent two years in Paris as a young man , but no English . Wang Meng had known no English until his arrival in this country , a couple of months before our get-together , but had become surprisingly well acquainted with our tongue . He has a way with languages . During the late fifties , when he began twenty years of exile in the northwestern region of Xinjiang , at times working as a peasant in the fields , he mastered Uighur and translated Uighur writings into Han . Wang Meng told us , in English , that when he got to the Iowa campus , his first stop here , the only English he had command of was " Bye-bye " and " O.K. " He added , " If you try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and told Ai Qing what Wang Meng had said , and then Ai Qing laughed . " Do n't make fun with me , " said Wang Meng , smiling . Wang Meng and Feng Yidai were in Western clothes . Ai Qing , every inch the Oriental elder , was wearing Chinese cloth shoes and a Chinese suit . We asked the poet what the acceptable term was these days , with the Gang of Four on trial , for a jacket like his  --  what we Americans had got used to calling a Mao jacket . All smiles vanished . " This was never a Mao jacket , " Ai Qing said after a reflective pause . " I am wearing what has always been a Dr. Sun Yat-sen jacket . " Leaving that for revisionist historians to grapple with , we inquired into the state of Western letters in China today . " I helped translate Herman Wouk 's The Winds of War ' six years ago , " Feng Yidai said . " But at that time it could be published only in a limited edition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what our people can read , it has been published in a first printing of five hundred thousand . That sold out in a week . Outside one Peking bookstore that opened at nine in the morning , lines began forming at midnight . " Ai Qing said that his favorite American poets , whom he had read in French , were Walt Whitman , Vachel Lindsay , and Langston Hughes . Wang Meng said that he was particularly fond of Hemingway , Joyce Carol Oates , and John Cheever . " Cheever very clear , sweet , bright , " he said . " I like it very much . " " Long Live the Youth , " a novel of Wang Meng 's , has yet to be translated into English , but it has sold a respectable three hundred and seventy thousand copies at home . He wrote it when he was a youth , but it was n't published for more than twenty years . Ai Qing , who on his return to China from Paris back in 1932 had been arrested by the Kuomintang , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventies . He wrote some poems in secret , in what little free time he could contrive : he 'd been assigned the task of cleaning public bathrooms in a remote village , and he had fifteen bathrooms to take care of . Feng Yidai , too , was in considerable disfavor in that period , and he had similar duties . " I collected animal excrement , " he told us . " I became a specialist in ox , cow , and horse manure . " Before our three guests returned to China , we learned , they would visit  --  besides Iowa and New York  --  Connecticut , Massachusetts , Indiana , California , and Washington , D.C. While they were in New York City , only Feng Yidai found time to look in on Bloomingdale 's big Chinese bazaar , " Too expensive , " he said . " Mostly , we 've been meeting and eating . My wife told me when I left Peking , When you 're in New York , I hope you smoke less , drink less , and eat fewer sweets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eating much ice cream . You have very good ice cream . " " This is Feng Yidai 's first trip out of China , and already he 's become American , " Ai Qing said . " I 've been to Western Europe , the Soviet Union , and South America , but I 'm still Chinese . " He offered us a strong Chinese cigarette . " Ai Qing was a great friend of Pablo Neruda , and entertained Neruda 1111011/ . three times in China , " Wang Meng said . " What I like about you Americans is that you 're hardworking , aggressive , and tolerant , " Ai Qing said . " I am impressed that everybody here can study , young or old , " Wang Meng said . Feng Yidai said , " In a San Francisco discotheque , I met a lady who was studying Chinese , and when I asked her how old she was , she said ' Eighty-two . ' I was really amazed . " Our visitors conferred in Chinese , and then Feng Yidai said apologetically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to get ready for a banquet being given in their honor in Chinatown . We asked as they were departing whether , with a new American President taking office , they anticipated any consequential change in Chinese-American relations . " Impossible , " Ai Qing said without hesitation . " One or two individuals ca n't decide that sort of thing . The trend has been toward friendship , and you ca n't stop a trend . " Car Questions I 'm a career girl in a man 's world . I 'm a career girl and 1 can make my own way . Go ahead baby , do your thing Go ahead baby , do your thing . ? " Career Girl , " by Carrie Lucas , THE Ford automobile heiresses Anne and Charlotte Ford have written a book about motorcars ( though only Ford cars are featured in the drawings and photographs in the book ) , called " How to Love the Car in Your Life . " The book , which they wrote with the assistance of two professional writers , has fifty-nine pages and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do about back-seat drivers , seating arrangements , conversation in the car , neatness , smoking , eating in the car , cats and dogs in the car , buying gasoline , opening the door for a woman , getting directions , travelling with children , entering the freeway , pulling off the road . But perhaps the most useful thing about it is that it is a guide to what to say to Anne or Charlotte Ford at a party . Guest to Anne or Charlotte Ford : " What is an automatic transaxle ? " Anne or Charlotte Ford to guest : " An automatic transaxle makes automatic shifting available in small front " Right in the middle of Lawrence Welk , he stood up , said , Toot , Toot , T ootsie , Goodbye , ' and I have n't seen him since . " wheel-drive cars equipped with trans-axles . " Guest to Anne or Charlotte Ford : " What is a dipstick ? " Anne or Charlotte Ford to guest : " A thin metal rod used to check an engine 's oil level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a jack ? " Anne or Charlotte Ford to guest : " If you do n't want to be your own demolition derby , it 's important to know that proper positioning of the jack varies from car to car . " The other day , the people at the Ford Motor Company threw a cocktail party for Anne and Charlotte Ford at the new Palace Hotel . Almost all the guests there looked as though they never drove themselves anywhere , or , if they did , they did n't actually have to . Anne , who studies political science at the New School , wore a short , snazzy-looking black dress . Charlotte , an acclaimed designer of women 's clothing and the author of a book on etiquette , also wore a short , snazzy-looking black dress . Governor Carey was there , and as he stood between Anne and Charlotte Ford and posed for photographers he looked less like a governor , though not like a mayor . Former Mayor Wagner was there , and he looked like a mayor and a governor and a President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children were there , and they were very friendly . Anne Ford 's piano teacher was there , and he was very nice and said a lot of nice things about her . About Charlotte Ford we heard a woman who is in the public-relations department of the Ford Motor Company say to the Ford account executive at the Wells , Rich , Greene ad agency , " Only you would appreciate this story of one-upmanship . The other day , I was up at Charlotte 's apartment and we were going over the guest list . She came to Mary Wells ' name and she said , ' My God ! I 've never met Mary Wells Lawrence . ' And so I said , Well , I have , ha , ha , ha . ' Of course , you know Charlotte is very interested in women who make it on their own , and for that Mary Wells is the ultimate role model . " Berrigan THE morning of New Year 's Day was cold and overcast : flat light coming from a yellow sky ; empty streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar , on West Twenty-third Street . A solitary man crossed an asphalt playground on Horatio Street , trailing a plume of cigarette smoke . There were four padlocks on the front of Ponce Sporting Goods Sales , on Madison Street , and Joe 's Spanish-American Record Shop ( " Candies  --  Reg . Nylons  --  Panty Hose  --  Latest Hits " ) was also locked , as were the MisiOn Pentecostal and Jehovah 's Witnesses buildings down the block . An elderly Chinese man wearing a blue ski jacket with a fur collar moved slowly across Mott Street at Grand . A long subway train came rattling and rumbling down the ramp of the Manhattan Bridge into Manhattan . Six teen-agers with two footballs began throwing passes in the small plaza between St. Andrew 's Church and the Municipal Building , behind the United States Courthouse on Foley Square . At the Ng Yung grocery , on lower Broadway , a man was putting boxes of red apples on the sidewalk ; a pile of ice left to melt in the gutter remained solid . Seagulls were flapping around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , No boats were moving on the river , and parts of it were frozen and white . In midmorning , we went to the upper West Side to visit an old friend  --  Daniel Berrigan , the Jesuit  --  and the day picked up immediately . We were cheered by the sight of him . He looked fine : he was thin as a stick , as always , and graying , but he was radiating warmth and good humor . " Happy New Year ! " he said . " Come on in ! " He was wearing jeans and a blue jersey , and his apartment was full of color : paintings ; handmade objects ; dried flowers ; bright fabrics ; lots of plants  --  fifteen of them , all thriving , in the living-room windows alone . On a bookshelf were eight novels by Dickens ; " Soviet Psychoprisons ; " Walt Whitman ; Gandhi ; Pascal ; Chekhov ; Hannah Arendt ; Karl Rahner ; Thomas Jefferson . There was a wall jammed with old photographs , and we asked Berrigan about the faces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " This is the priest who married my parents in Minnesota . He was a Croatian immigrant . He lived among the Indians , and spoke their language . " He went on to others : " This is my grandmother  --  Brigid Doherty , from Tipperary . She and my grandfather , Thomas Berrigan , had gone out to where the Trappists had a farm in Iowa , but it was so harsh that two of their children died , and they moved back East  --  to Syracuse , New York , where there was a colony from Tipperary . My grandfather died young , of what they called ' immigrant 's disease , ' which was really t.b . People caught it on the boat , or as an aftereffect of the Famine . The Irish immigrants had a very haunting sense of dying young . This is my grandmother 's brother . He was a plowboy in Albany , and decided to become a priest . He died young , too  --  in an accident while building his church . He had a great reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was a wisp of a girl . At sixteen , she began teaching in a one-room school , where they taught eight grades at once . She told us they would put a teacher applicant against a wall in those days and shoot a bullet at her . If she did n't wince , she got the job . ' I did n't wince , ' she said . She also had to help raise her nine brothers and sisters , but when they were grown  --  two died  --  she entered the convent . She was thirty-six . She became a Sister of Charity in New York . The Sisters were teachers , and they started hospitals and orphanages . She was a very dear friend . She died at ninety-one . This is my mother 's mother . She was German . She and her husband had gone to Minnesota , where they got forty free acres from the government . It was mostly forest . They had to build a log cabin and ' make land ' for farming . Look at those arms and hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . He was a dashing railroad engineer for the Northern Pacific . She was a milliner . Being a typical Irishman , he did n't marry until he was thirty-four . Sometimes my brothers and I would kid my mother , saying , ' How 'd you ever get stuck with hint ? ' Depending on her mood , she 'd say , ' I 'll have you know your father was considered a great catch , ' or she 'd say , ' Somebody " I decided not to mince words with you , Newcroft . But on second thought I think I will . " THE NEW YORAEfi should have knocked me in the head . ' Here 's my mother in old age . Ninety . She was the joy of our hearts ; a great , lovely lady . This is me and two of my brothers last summer in Ireland . We went to try to be of some help to the political prisoners . This is Rose Hawthorne , the daughter of Nathaniel Hawthorne . She founded St. Rose 's Home , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day a week . It 's a hospital run by nuns for the poor who are dying of cancer . This is Thomas Merton in 1965 . He and I were close friends for years . About a dozen of us had gone down for a retreat with him titled the Roots of Protest , and later on we used to joke that everybody on that retreat had either gone to jail or died . It was just a good , good thing . Here 's my brother Phil and me the day he got out of Danbury prison , at Christmas , 1972 . There 's Dorothy Day . Her funeral was just a few weeks ago , with a beautiful and funny procession on Second Avenue from the Catholic Worker to the church . The Cardinal came down and gave a blessing . Dorothy Day was a very important teacher to me for twenty years , getting me beyond moral theology and just-war theories , and saying , Just no killing , no killing at all . ' " He stepped back . " Flow about some lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there was bread , and somebody had sent him a jar of jelly made out of grapes from the grape arbor at his old family home in Syracuse . During lunch , Berrigan , who is out on bail and will shortly stand trial with his brother Philip and six others for entering a General Electric plant in King of Prussia , Pennsylvania , and damaging with hammers two Mark 12A reentry-vehicle warheads , talked briefly about that protest . " Phil said at one point , ' Even if nothing came of it , I would still do it . ' This marks a change in both of us . We have Iet go of the idea of its having an effect . We do n't need to dwell on results just that it 's a good thing , and let it go after that . Something had to be done , and we could n't live with doing nothing . It 's almost a law that the greater the danger to life is , the harder it is to cope with it or do something about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that 's a time when it 's even more important ; it 's a kind of beckoning . I 've encountered a lot of people recently in this country who are outside the politics that pretends to include them . There are millions of people who have no stake in the arms race . They 're at sea ; they do n't know what to do . As for me , to he going to jail is to be going where we ought to be , and I 'm grateful for friends who are with us . I feel hopeful in a measured sort of way . Working at St. Rose 's has given me a kind of clue to the whole thing  --  to understanding the poor people , the cancer people , even the Pentagon people , since they are victims , too , except for those at the top . " He looked at the grape-jelly jar . " My father lived to be ninety , " he said , " and he drove a car right up to the end , although at only about four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; she 'd watch from the window and pray . I remember one day he backed the car slowly out of the garage , across the lawn , and through the grape arbor , taking the whole thing with him . The car rolled down a small hill and came to a stop . Presently , my father emerged from the car , adorned with grape leaves  --  perfectly O.K. but looking like Bacchus . " Berrigan sliced some more bread , and asked , " How about some honey ? " He went into the kitchen and came back with a small ceramic pot . " This belonged to Dorothy Day , " he said . " They gave it to me after she died . " He peered into it . " They said she never had any honey anyway . "
