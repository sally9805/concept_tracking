The collection of talent was impressive , if not quite a match for the hyperbolic title : Frank , Liza &; Sammy : The Ultimate Event ! Still , when Frank Sinatra , Liza Minnelli and Sammy Davis Jr . commanded the stage two weeks ago for a 90-minute TV concert , they were doing more than just a routine network special . The concert was the latest offering in a busy new realm of video mega-events : pay-per-view television . <P> Pay-per-view is hardly the ultimate in TV technology , but it may be an idea whose time has finally come . Conventional pay-cable channels , like HBO and Showtime , offer viewers a smorgasbord of programming for one monthly fee . Pay- per-view instead gives viewers a chance to select from a menu , paying only for the programs they want to see . Prices typically range from $4 or $5 for recent movies to $15 or $20 for concerts and sport events . Pay-per-view is still a pint-size player in the TV marketplace : only 11 million TV homes ( out of 90.4 million ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a media research firm . But revenues are growing fast ( from $88 million in 1987 to $200 million last year ) , and the number of PPV homes , Kagan forecasts , will nearly double by 1992 . <P> The two largest PPV companies , Viewer 's Choice ( which reaches 5 million homes ) and Request Television ( more than 4 million ) , each offer customers a monthly program slate filled largely with movies . But the business 's new boomlet has been propelled mainly by special events . Last June 's heavyweight title fight between Mike Tyson and Michael Spinks was sold to nearly 600,000 TV homes on a pay-per-view basis at an average $35 a crack . Wrestling matches have proved an even bigger draw . Wrestlemania IV had a reported 900,000 takers last March ( the largest audience yet claimed for a PPV event ) , and well-hyped ring battles like last week 's Chi-Town Rumble ' 89 are coming almost monthly . Robbie Knievel , son of daredevil Evel , will attempt a motorcycle jump over the fountains at Las Vegas ' Caesars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supermiddleweight title fight between Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas Hearns will be offered over PPV in June . <P> Pay-per-view has had its share of duds . A Dirty Dancing concert last November drew fewer than 80,000 subscribers . Viewership for the Sinatra- Minnelli-Davis concert is still being tabulated , but will probably fall well short of 100,000 . Still , the concert 's packager , Showtime Event Television , is pursuing other big stars for PPV events , and industry executives are bullish . " We 're building an electronic arena , " says Jeffrey Reiss , chairman of Request Television . " The day will come when Bruce Springsteen will be playing pay-per-view at the end of his tour . We 're betting on the future . " <P> The future may come sooner than expected because of the 1992 Summer Olympics . Along with the 150-plus hours of over-the-air coverage it will provide , NBC has announced plans to offer separate packages of events for PPV . The prospect of large revenues from the Olympics is likely to spur more cable systems to acquire PPV technology before then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
