Before the President arrived , three cargo planes hauled to Barbados three armored limousines for his motorcades , four armored cars for the Secret Service , and four Marine helicopters-one for Reagan , one for the press , and two in case the others broke down . There were spare parts , of course , and even two fire engines flown from the U.S. to stand by at the airport as Reagan landed . Air Force One was followed , as always , by a back-up jet and a press plane . On a trip like the one to Barbados , 150 Air Force and other personnel go along to fly , drive , fix and guard Reagan 's vehicles . <P> PROTECTION .
