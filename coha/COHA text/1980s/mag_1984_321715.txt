The new leader of Canada 's ruling Liberal Party , Toronto Lawyer John Turner , 55 , became the nation 's 17th Prime Minister last week , succeeding the retiring Pierre Trudeau , 64 . Early Saturday morning , Trudeau drove from his official residence in Ottawa to Government House , where he offered his resignation . Scarcely half an hour later , Turner and his new 28-member Cabinet arrived to be sworn into office by Governor General Jeanne Sauve . <P> The star of the Cabinet , which has eight fewer members than under Trudeau , is Jean Chretien , who ran second to Turner in the party leadership fight last month . By offering the popular Chretien the important posts of Secretary of State for External Affairs and Deputy Prime Minister , Turner went a long way toward unifying the party and reinforcing the Liberals ' traditionally strong position in Quebec . Turner 's first task is to get his party re-elected over the Progressive Conservative Party led by Businessman Brian Mulroney . Elections could be called as early as Aug. 27.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
