Britain dickers with China over the future of Hong Kong <P> Even for the vague , elliptical world of international diplomacy , it was a desultory summit . After a ritual wiping of hands and sipping of tea , the two leaders spent 2hours ( about half of it in translation ) exchanging contrary views and , for all intents and purposes , agreeing only to disagree . Then , in an unfortunate conclusion to the visit , Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher left her final meeting in Peking with China 's senior leader , Deng Xiaoping , only to stumble face first on the broad stairs . The unintended symbolism of the spill in full view of television cameras was not missed . On her arrival in Hong Kong Sunday , on the last leg of a two-week Asian tour , the Prime Minister faced a barrage of local criticism that she had got off on the wrong foot in the opening round of Sino-British talks over the future of the crown colony . <P> That future , in the eyes of Hong Kong 's 5.5 million nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the luxurious mountaintop mansions of " the peak " to the factory floors of Kowloon , from the shimmering office towers of the business district to the wretched squatter camps near Aberdeen , the consuming topic of conversation nowadays is what exactly will happen to Hong Kong before July 1 , 1997 . That is the date when more than 90% of Hong Kong 's land area , the 373-sq. - mi . New Territories , will revert to China under the terms of the 99-year lease that imperial Britain wrested from the tottering Qing Dynasty in 1898 . Although earlier treaties gave Britain the remaining 34 sq . mi. in perpetuity , that area depends on the New Territories for food and water and can not survive alone . Literally overnight , Kai Tak international airport , half of Hong Kong 's new subway system , and most of the colony 's housing would no longer exist under the shadow of the Union Jack , but rather under the five-star flag of the People 's Republic . <P> In Hong Kong , where the most authoritarian portrait on public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens not to litter , the rising if still distant threat of reunification has hit like a typhoon . After Thatcher 's visit , share prices on Hong Kong 's stock market crashed 21% last week , while the Hong Kong dollar dropped by 4%to U.S. $0.16 , a new low . To deepen the gloom , Hong Kong 's Financial Secretary , John Bremridge , announced last week that the colony 's economy has been faring far worse this year than expected . Real economic growth will measure only 4% ; it was 11% in 1981 . Exports of goods produced in Hong Kong will decline 2% . And investments will rise only 3% , after reaching 13% last year . Said a concerned businessman : " Today Hong Kong has double trouble : economic and political . "
