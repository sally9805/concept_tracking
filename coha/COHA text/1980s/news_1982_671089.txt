An old saying about a good cook holds that he or she " could make a thistle palatable . " Well , where artichokes are concerned , that is all too easy , because artichokes , which are members of the thistlelike Composite family , along with daisies and chrysanthemums , are as versatile as anything out of the garden. // Consider their uses . They may be eaten whole , hot or cold , one leaf at a time , with the meaty part of each leaf serving merely to tempt the appetite for the fleshy bottom . Cold they serve as the perfect foil for mustard , mayonnaise or vinaigrette dressing . Hot they are the sumptuous base for the likes of bearnaise sauce ( an artichoke // // Recipes are on page C6. <> bottom with bearnaise is the classic garnish for tournedos Henri IV ) or a hollandaise or mousseline . And whole but hollowed out an artichoke may be filled with savory meat or vegetable stuffings and baked until tender. // Pared of its leaves , the neatly turned heart at the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for such stuffings as spinach or mushrooms or ham or veal , to be topped , if desired , with Proven , cale or Mornay sauce . The heart may also be cooked a la grecque , or sliced or quartered and fried , or turned into an elegant puree , or even used as a garnish or base for soups. // What is more , in experimenting recently , Pierre Franey and I determined that artichokes , because of their flavor and texture , are one of the best of greens for no-salt cookery . In preparing the recipes for this article not a speck of salt was used , and the results are excellent. // In the book " Food , " the culinary authority Waverley Root offers a surprising idea : that artichokes are not widely enjoyed in the United States .

The heart of American artichoke production is said to be Castroville , Calif. , a town on Monterey Bay south of San Francisco that is known as the artichoke center of the world. // The peak of the season is from now until the end of May , so good artichokes should be in abundance , though they are not available everywhere . Current prices range from 79 cents a pound for quite small ones to $1 or more apiece for large ones ; some large ones could be found for as little as 49 cents . When selecting them at your market , look for the ones that have a deep green color ; they should be free of blemishes or brown spots on the outer leaves. // As to the etymology of the name , it is attributed to the Arabic alharsuf , which became alcarchofa in Spanish , articiocco in Italian and artichaut in French .
