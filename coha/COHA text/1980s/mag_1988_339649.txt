A fresh burst of takeover cross fire rattled through corporate boardrooms last week as acquirers battled for control of companies that make everything from bath towels ( West Point Pepperell ) to cake mixes ( Pillsbury ) . Costliest of all was the struggle for RJR Nabisco ( 1987 revenues : $16 billion ) , whose price tag set a record with each new offer . Top RJR Nabisco executives , backed by Wall Street 's Shearson Lehman Hutton and Salomon Brothers , raised their bid from $17.6 billion to $21 billion , topping the rival offer of $20.6 billion from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts , the high-flying leveraged-buyout firm . Now the two sides may be getting new competition . At week 's end Forstmann Little , a Manhattan investment firm , said it might make an even higher bid for RJR Nabisco , backed by Procter &; Gamble and other large corporate investors . <P> Whichever bid ultimately succeeds , the RJR Nabisco buyout may be too big for one team to handle . Hoping to join forces , KKR and the company 's managers met around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when RJR Nabisco chief executive Ross Johnson agreed to share control of the company with KKR . <P> Talks then stalled over KKR 's insistence that Drexel Burnham Lambert manage the buyout 's junk-bond financing . KKR contends that only Drexel has the savvy to sell the record $5 billion in high-yield bonds that is needed . But RJR Nabisco 's managers are concerned that the buyout could be jeopardized if Drexel and Michael Milken , its junk-bond wizard , are indicted for securities fraud , which is expected to occur soon . <P> While the suitors struggled to come to terms , a sudden truce was called in another huge takeover fight when Kraft ( ' 87 revenues : $10 billion ) agreed to be acquired by Philip Morris ( $28 billion ) . Hamish Maxwell , chairman of Philip Morris , said he will not have to sell off chunks of Kraft to finance the buyout . Said he : " For the vast majority of Kraft workers , this wo n't have any impact at all . " The Philip Morris coup was an unusually smooth resolution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm accepted a $2.5 billion offer from British financier and press lord Robert Maxwell . In Georgia , Joseph Lanier , chairman of West Point Pepperell , which makes Arrow shirts and Martex towels , was determined to beat back a bid for his company from Chicago investor William Farley , whose company makes Fruit of the Loom underwear . Said Lanier : " We intend to whip him , and are going to fight him until hell freezes over . " <P> The feeding frenzy is making some financial experts nervous about the growing degree of corporate debt . In a whimsical proposal for the biggest takeover of all , James Grant , editor of Grant 's Interest Rate Observer , has outlined a strategy for a $115 billion leveraged buyout of IBM . But could Big Blue meet payments on the $97 billion in new borrowing ? No problem , said Grant . The computer giant could manage if it slashed R. and D. 80% and scrapped most of its new products . The real winners : bankers and lawyers , who would make a quick $4.9 billion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
