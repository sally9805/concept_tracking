Catherine and Joseph Zak were just being sociable : when Donald Gwinnell visited their Long Branch , N.J. , home , they served him Scotch . He drove off-and into a head-on collision with Marie Kelly . Seriously injured , Kelly sued Gwinnell . But then Gwinnell joined her in a separate suit against the Zaks , claiming they were responsible for giving him too much booze and permitting him to drive away . <P> In a surprising 6-to-1 decision last week , New Jersey 's supreme court ruled that the Zaks could in fact be tried for negligence . However , the court limited the scope of its decision to instances where a sober host " directly serves " liquor to an intoxicated guest . Hosts of parties with " many guests " would not be liable . <P> Still , the precedent may inspire lawsuits throughout the U.S. <P> Dissenting Justice Marie Garibaldi said that it could open the door to " speculative and subjective " legal judgments . But Chief Justice Robert N. Wilentz wrote that society has now decided it must " do whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunken drivers . " Washington seems to agree . Last week Congress approved and sent to the President a bill that will cut federal highway funds for states that do not adopt a minimum drinking age of 21.
