Prompt action to change the support levels for these two basic commodities was dictated by the surpluses American dairy farmers are piling up as well as by the glut in world sugar production that is depressing the prices American sugar growers are receiving. // With dairy supports now costing taxpayers more than $250 , 000 every hour and the full program expected to add at least $2. 2 billion to the President ' s budget next year , Agriculture Secretary John R. Block was pressing for a reduction of at least $1 in the current dairy price support level of $13. 10 a hundred pounds. // // Sugar Quotas Planned // At the same time , the Agriculture Department , if it can get the State Department to agree , is planning to announce a country-bycountry quota on sugar imports in an effort to force domestic sugar prices up to at least 20 cents a pound. // Unless a quota , which has not been used since 1974 , is soon imposed , the Office of Management and Budget contends that the Administration will have to take over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new sugar loan program . President Reagan did not want the program but agreed not to oppose it last year in return for Southern votes for his 1982 budget. // When the Administration insisted last December that dairy products be supported at a maximum of $13. 10 , dairy state Congressmen , especially House members facing re-election this fall , contended that this was too low and would force dairy farmers into bankruptcy. // But the Administration persisted , arguing that this level was high enough to protect the farmers but low enough to discourage them from overproducing about 10 percent more milk than could be consumed as cheese , butter and dried milk . <> <> Rise in Milk Production // However , this assumption has not been realized . Milk production rose again at the beginning of April , as it has in virtually every month for the last year. // This has produced ever-increasing surpluses , which the Federal Government has to buy and store to sustain the $13. 10 support level . Even the politically powerful dairy industry , which has contributed so heavily in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support program must be made. // The industry was also on notice from Senator Jesse Helms , the North Carolina Republican who heads the Senate Agriculture Committee , that something must be done soon to check overproduction of milk. // " The dairy producers and their lobbyists ought to understand that if the American people become more aware of what the dairy program is costing , the industry may end up losing the whole program , " Senator Helms said . <> <> No Agreement on Solution // But the problem is that neither the dairy industry nor its Congressmen have been able to agree with the Administration on what form these changes should take. // Although the White House is still trying to decide on the details of its proposals , Mr. Block was advocating a straight reduction in the $13. 10 support level , either by $1 or by $2 per hundred pounds , effective as soon as approved by Congress . Mr. Block was also said to be considering some additional giveaway plans under which more surplus dairy products would be offered to the poor. // On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several dairystate Congressmen , want a dual pricing system under which the Administration would pay the full $13. 10 support price for up to a ceiling of 5 billion pounds of surplus dairy products . Whatever farmers produced above that ceiling would be supported at a fraction of that amount. // The industry also wanted appointment of a special dairy board that would attempt to sell any production in excess of the 5 billion pound ceiling in foreign markets at world prices , which are well below the support price . <> <> Industry Plan Opposed // The Administration opposed this on the ground that it did not want to relinquish control over any aspect of the support program to an industry group . It also opposed the foreign sale program on the ground that it could lead to charges of dumping from this country ' s trading partners. // In contrast , American cane and beet sugar growers produce only about 55 percent of this country ' s domestic sugar needs . The rest has to be imported. // Under the past program for protecting American sugar producers , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise its price to about 15 cents per pound , insuring domestic producers this same price level. // Last summer , with a huge world sugar crop , prices began slipping . Congressmen from the Southern and Western states where cane and sugar beets are grown sought to re-establish a sugar loan program with a minimum support level of 17 cents . Despite his philosophical objections to further Government interference in the market , Mr. Reagan agreed to this in return for support of sugar-state Democrats on his budget and tax packages . <> <> Consumer Group Position // The imposition of a sugar import quota is opposed by consumer groups , who object to the 4 cent per pound price increase this is expected to cause. // If the free market price were to stay below the 17 cents per pound loan level , sugar producers would place their crops under loan to the Government and forfeit them if the price did not rise well above 17 cents when the loans were due. // Under international agreements , duties can not be raised high enough to push the domestic price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid having growers take out loans and the Government ' s having to take over and store their sugar at the taxpayers ' expense. // By imposing quotas that would reduce each exporting country ' s shipments by about 10 percent , the domestic price could be raised to 20 cents , sugar industry analysts believe. // But this would mean forcing such friends and allies as Australia , the Philippines and Brazil to reduce their exports to the United States . Sugar traders also believe quotas would generally disrupt the world market and would cause another drop in world prices. //
