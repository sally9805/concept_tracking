He said much of the terror had been inflicted by Government forces , using United States weapons. // " I know about the morticians who travel the streets each morning to collect the bodies of those summarily dispatched the night before by Salvadoran security forces - gangland style - the victim on bended knee , thumbs wired behind the back , a bullet through the brain , " the Senator said. // Senator Dodd responded to the President ' s address in a 10-minute televised speech from a chamber on the Senate side of the Capitol . He had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia , the Democratic leaders , to make the response . His remarks , immediately after Mr. Reagan ' s speech to a joint session of Congress , were broadcast by the three major networks. // Senior Democratic members of Congress were given a copy of the President ' s speech an hour and a half before it was delivered at 8 P.M. // Both Republican and Democratic leaders have acknowledged concern in Congress about the policies on Central America , but Congress postponed further action until after the President ' s address . Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee asked Mr. O ' Neill today for a closed session of the House so that they could brief their colleagues on the region. // The House committee is scheduled to meet on Thursday to consider a Democratic proposal to cut off covert military aid to Nicaraguan rebels , and instead recommend overt aid to friendly nations in the region to interdict weapons flowing to guerrillas in El Salvador. // Senator Dodd said at the outset of his speech that all Americans were opposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not accept the creation of Soviet military bases there .

" // " Instead of trying to do something about the factors which breed revolution , this Administration has turned to massive military buildups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Senator Dodd said . " Its policy is ever-increasing military assistance , endless military training , even hiring our own paramilitary guerrillas . This is a formula for failure . And it is a proven prescription for picking a loser . " <> <> Salvadorans Reluctant to Fight // What return had been achieved , he asked , for the money spent ? The Salvadoran Army has been reluctant to fight , he said , and more than 30 , 000 civilians have been killed , " and the majority of them have been victims of the Government ' s own security forces. " // " For those 30 , 000 murders , confirmed by our own embassy , there have been fewer than 200 convictions , " the Senator said . Instead of pouring more weapons into the area , he said , the United States should seek " an immediate cessation of hostilities " and work for negotiated political settlements. // " In El Salvador , the rebels have offered to negotiate unconditionally , " he said . " Let us test their sincerity . " As for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country is under the delusion that the Sandinista Government is a model democracy or a force for stability , " Senator Dodd said .

" // " We are doing for the Sandinista Marxists what they could not do for themselves , " he said .

Mineta , Democrat of California , who as a member of the Intelligence Committee visited Central America last weekend , said he did not see " one shred of evidence " that the Administration was conducting a policy aimed at the interdiction of arms flowing into Nicaragua. // " I think what we should do is to stop the flow of funds for the covert operations , " Mr. Mineta said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith , who was in charge of the mission to Cuba from 1979 to July 1982 , said the President ' s speech " does not hold out any possibility for a solution.

Long , Democrat of Louisiana , praised Mr. Reagan and said , " The solutions to the conflict as outlined by the President are sound and just. " // Senator Alan Cranston , Democrat of California , the minority whip , said " the President is proposing only military solutions " that were doomed to failure . The Senator called for a " Marshall Plan for Central America " to combat the poverty that breeds revolution . Similarly , Senator Edward M. Kennedy , Democrat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall policy is a prescription for a wider war. " // Republicans generally supported the President . Senators John Tower of Texas said he would support the " moderate and prudent measures " recommended by Mr. Reagan . Senator Bob Dole of Kansas called the President ' s tone " just right. " // Another Republican , Senator Dick Lugar of Indiana , said : " I believe that the President makes a strong argument that moral principles and American national interests coincide in Central America , and require a strong policy of support for democratic forces there .
