A clergyman has approached me with an idea he believes will make this a happier and more peaceful society . He wants all of us to make a habit of smiling at each other . As Pastor T.L. Barrett Jr. put it , in his written proposal : " The major objective of the Smile America ' concept is to launch a nationwide campaign , which will inspire , enlighten and provide the incentive for the development of an inevitable consciousness of the acknowledgment of mankind , through a natural , genuine smile . " To remind people to smile , he wants to see the " Smile America " slogan plastered over T-shirts , headbands , bumper stickers , coffee mugs and dozens of other products . And when the nation is thoroughly inundated in " Smile America " products , and we are all flashing our choppers at each other , he believes we will all be nicer and the crime rate will go down and we will feel relaxed and experience good vibrations . In sending me his proposal , he said : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be helpful to me . " I ' m afraid that Rev. Barrett has come to the wrong person for input on smiling . As anyone who knows me is aware , I smile only when it is absolutely necessary and unavoidable , which isn ' t very often . I have friends of many years who can ' t say for certain that I have teeth . There are many reasons I don ' t smile . For one thing , smiling is unnatural because it violates the laws of nature . When you smile , your facial muscles resist gravity . It is far more natural for your face to let gravity do its thing and cause your face to droop . If nature intended us to be smiling all the time , we would have been made with our heads upside down . So by defying gravity , smiling can be compared to bouncing up and down for no reason , or flapping your arms and trying to fly like a bird or bat . What kind of society would we be if everyone kept bouncing and flapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , consider what other earthly creatures smile to show friendliness and happiness , sincere or otherwise . The answer is none . When a dog or cat or any other beastie pulls back its lips and shows its teeth-an act we call a smile-it means that it is about to chomp on you and you ' d better take off . Only humans show their teeth as an act of friendliness . And even then , you can ' t be sure of the motive . Think about it . Which humans smile the most ? Politicians , used-car salesmen , quiz show hosts and drunken conventioneers , that ' s who . Is that who this Rev. Barrett wants the whole country to emulate ? Car salesmen , politicians , quiz show hosts and drunken conventioneers ? Look through history books and see if you can find one picture of Abe Lincoln smiling . Of course you can ' t . He knew what was going on , and if you know what ' s going on , you don ' t smile much . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He never stops smiling , even when there isn ' t anything to smile about , which on his show is just about all the time . If you stuck your thumb in Letterman ' s eye , he ' d smile . So ask yourself : Would you prefer a nation of Abe Lincolns or David Lettermans ? ( Please don ' t send me your choice . I ' m sure the results would be depressing . ) It might be unfair , but I don ' t trust people who smile all the time . As Slats Grobnik put it : " Anybody who smiles all the time is hiding something , even if it is only sore feet . " And many scientific surveys have shown that people who are habitual smilers are more inclined to say : " Have a nice day . " This dumb phrase is one of the nation ' s leading causes of mental stress and depression , because most people will not have a nice day . So after someone tells them to have a nice day , and they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong with themselves for not having a nice day . And , of course , they shouldn ' t blame themselves . Most people get up in the morning and go to work or to school . They buck traffic or wait for a dawdling bus . They confront a demanding boss , a nasty customer , a crabby teacher . They get traffic tickets . They have headaches . They fear getting bald , fat or wrinkled . They have debts . They see things in store windows that they can ' t afford . They lose a contact lens or suffer some other tragedy . They go home and find that the puppy has wet the rug . With all this torment , how can they have a nice day ? And why should they go around smiling or tolerating chronic smilers ? They shouldn ' t . They should do what comes naturally , which is to scowl . You can always trust a scowler . Have you ever walked into a car lot and been sold a lemon by a scowler ? Some sharp-eyed readers have probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a small smile , but a smile nonetheless . So , you ask , if I am a scowler , why did I smile for the picture ? The photographer made me do it . He told me he had a terrible toothache.
