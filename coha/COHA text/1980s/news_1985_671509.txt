" Did you ever hear of a boy getting up at 5 : 30 in the morning to take a bath ? " said Mercedes Lynch of Harlem . Mrs. Lynch never did . But then , her son Wallace B. Lynch Jr. , age 8 , had never been to sleep-away camp before . He did not want to miss the bus or anything else. // Wallace and his mother arrived at 128th Street in Harlem an hour and a half early . " Anxiety , anxiety , " Mrs. Lynch said as she watched Wallace board the bus for Camp Echo Lake . " I ' m praying to the Lord that Wallace will get there in one piece. " // Wallace was excited , but he was nervous , too . He thought a camp in the woods meant deep in a dark forest . " I think it might be a little scary , " he said. // During the four-hour ride to the Adirondacks , he sat with his best friend , Ismaiyl Bonets , who lives in the same apartment house in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if Wallace saw anything good out the window , like the Tappan Zee Bridge , he would say , " Ishy , look at that. " // When the bus pulled into Camp Echo Lake last Thursday afternoon , Wallace was pleased to see basketball courts and even a road with a few cars going by . " I thought we would be in the woods , " he said . " This is the woods , but not all the way in . I thought we ' d be where nobody was passing. " // There is always a little confusion at first , even among the counselors , for each summer at this time , a change comes over Echo Lake. // The first eight weeks of summer , Echo Lake is a place for boys and girls whose parents can afford the $2 , 800 fee . Most come from the New York metropolitan area and a substantial number are from Mexico and Europe . ' Every Kid Wants Love ' // Last Tuesday , those youngsters left . Two days later , Wallace , Ismaiyl and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not afford camp if Maurice and Amy Stein , the Echo Lake directors , did not open their place free of charge. // The two sets of campers never meet . It has been this way since the Steins started the free , weeklong camp 15 years ago . " We didn ' t think it would work , just throwing them in with kids who have everything , " Mrs. Stein said. // In past years , American Camping Association officials have asked directors of 100 private camps to start similar summer-end programs for the poor , but so far , officials say , Echo Lake is the only one in New York , New Jersey or Connecticut. // The differences between the two sets of campers are great and small . " Every kid wants love and attention , " said Glenn Begly , a head counselor . Rich or poor , little girl campers sing wherever they go . Boys are too mature . Children who are well off lose more things . They filled six barrels in the lost and found this camp season . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said Greg Suss , a head counselor : " They hold onto everything. " // On Monday of last week , the 420 boys and girls in the first group of campers spent the day packing for home . A counselor , Alan Nadel , was helping Bunk 5 , and as usual , Jeff Levin , 10 , of Scarsdale , N.Y. , was so busy doing everything else , he was last. // " Jeff , chill out , " Mr. Nadel said . " Get all your tapes in one area , please. " // Jeff packed his two Cabbage Patch dolls , his Mr. T card game and his two machine-gun squirt guns . He found his baseball stickers and wrist band under the bed . The wrist band reminded him that he was going to start a rock band this fall. // Cleaning his storage bin , he found his Bruce Springsteen " Born to Run " tape , which he had never opened , and his music headset , which was broken . " We ' re moving now , " Mr. Nadel said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t you wear it all summer ? " " I wore it twice and got a stain on it , " said Jeff. // " What is this ? " said Mr. Nadel , holding up a small gadget . " A flashlight , " said Jeff . " I need some cooperation , " said Mr. Nadel . " This is fun , " said Jeff . " What is this ? " said Mr. Nadel . " A toenail clipper , " said Jeff . He packed his visor with the radio on it and decided he would carry onto the bus his stuffed , oversize baseball , his tennis racket and his big radio . He also left out his hat that looks like a duck , to wear home. // Many used to bring hair dryers , but eight years ago , the Steins banned them . " We had kids who wanted to spend all day blow-drying their hair , " Mrs. Stein said . " We felt banning them would be a statement. " // The blow-dryer rule upset some campers and may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // If the camp has a philosophy , it is that every child can take part in every event . " We move these kids from their own self-imposed Nerdville , " Mrs. Stein said. // " My favorite position in baseball , " Mike Goldin said , " was pitcher ' s helper . Note , it ' s not really a position. " // When Mike arrived at camp , he was afraid to play sports . " I eavesdropped on his last call home , " said his counselor , George Stein , son of the directors . " He said , ' Dad , I don ' t want to play softball any more - can I play hardball ? ' " // The buses for Great Neck , L.I. , left first on Tuesday morning , at 9 : 30 . Mrs. Stein had Dramamine for anyone who might get bus sick . Brett Bernstein read newspaper comics his mother had sent him . Scott Wit tried playing his big radio , but the batteries had worn out . Jeremy Turk said , " We ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are. " // Jonathan Land told his seatmate that when he first got to camp , he woke up each morning before everyone else and cried . But then his counselor let him go out early to feed the camp animals , and that stopped most of his sad feelings. // The camp high point , he said , was when an older girl , a lower intermediate named Stacy , asked him to dance . She was pretty nice , he said. // At 11 : 30 , the alarm on Jonathan ' s digital watch went off , which meant lunch . The counselors passed out roast beef , salami or bologna on a bagel. // When the campers arrived in Great Neck , everyone was amazed at how much they had grown . There were hugs and kisses and some valuable home-movie footage was shot . A new tennis racket was left behind on the bus . Another Group Arrives // The Echo Lake bus left Harlem Thursday morning . At first it was very quiet . Hannible Tobe , 7 , and Gerardo Urbina , 9 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of alligators . Pretty soon , campers discovered a bathroom in the rear of the bus , and they all ran into and out of it and screamed a lot. // At camp , the boys in Bunk 23 saw a chipmunk . Lamont Harrell found a dragonfly . " It could kill you , right ? " he said. // Mr. Suss taught new campers how to line up around the flagpole . " Bunk 25 looks awful good , " he said . He explained the rules . Never think about fighting , was one rule . " If you feel like hitting someone , see your counselor , " he said. // " Swearing is like hitting someone with a word , " Mr. Begly said . He said if anyone felt like swearing , he should tell his counselor . ' Caring Environment ' // Counselors volunteer their time at the late-season camp . " When we started this 15 years ago , " Mr. Begly said , " it was a different era . Some of us had grandiose notions of what could be done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short period. " // " Now , " he said , " we ' re just trying to give the most caring environment we can . " He said that perhaps the children would take some of it back to Harlem , even if it was just a nice memory for a winter day when things were not going well. // Already memories were stacking up . Skipping rope , Nakia Matthews jumped double dutch up to 50 . Walter Dandridge saw a daddy-longlegs under the cabin porch. // " There ' s a whole bunch down there , " Ismaiyl said. // A campfire was built and several stories were told , including one Mr. Suss knew about a bad boy who came to camp and wound up being the best boy there ever was . They learned an Echo Lake song that began , " If I couldn ' t go to Echo Lake , I ' ll tell you what I ' d do . I ' d stick my head in a lion ' s mouth and say , ' chew , chew , chew. ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallace said : " It ' s fun , ask Ishy , ask anybody . Even the pillow they give us is comfortable. " //
