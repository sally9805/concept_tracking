To the people of the tiny central African state of Rwanda she was known as Nyiramacibili , or " the Woman Who Lives Alone in the Forest . " Her real name was Dian Fossey , and she was a onetime occupational therapist from Louisville . For most of the past 18 years Fossey had lived at a remote camp on the slopes of a dormant volcano . There she studied and befriended the rare mountain gorillas , fiercely defending the huge , gentle creatures against the encroachment of poachers . Almost everyone , including her last research assistant , Wayne McGuire , 34 , a doctoral candidate from the University of Oklahoma , felt she was more comfortable with the primates than with human beings , and Fossey apparently agreed . " I have no friends , " she once said . " The more you learn about the dignity of the gorilla , the more you want to avoid people . " <P> Early on the morning of Dec. 27 , 1985 , Dian Fossey , 53 , was found dead in the bedroom of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two by the blows of a machete . Her shocked acquaintances and colleagues suspected she had been murdered by the Rwandan poachers against whom she had waged war for more than a decade . She had burned their huts , cut their trap lines and paid government guards to bring suspected poachers to her for interrogation . Some of her acquaintances believed the poachers had long ago begun to retaliate by slaughtering her favorite creatures , concentrating on the particular gorillas she had been studying among the 29 groups in the surrounding national park . <P> The Rwandan government , it turns out , had different ideas . Last week it announced it had issued an arrest warrant for McGuire , who stayed on to run the camp after Fossey 's death . He left Rwanda in late July , after hearing rumors of his impending arrest . A government official , Jean-Damasdene Nkezabo , disclosed that although McGuire was regarded as the " principal author of the murder , " five Rwandans who had worked at the camp were being charged as accomplices . The presumed motive was the theft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The official statements were greeted by widespread skepticism . Declared Biologist Ian Redmond , who knew both Fossey and McGuire and spent two years at the camp : " The charge is nonsense . They 've concentrated on trying to find someone who is not a Rwandan . " Others questioned whether , if he was really implicated , McGuire would have remained at the camp for seven months and whether he could have expected to gain very much by stealing scientific data to which he already had access . And besides , they argued , McGuire had been in Rwanda just five months at the time of Fossey 's death , knew only a few words of French and Swahili , and would have had to converse with his " co- conspirators " in sign language . <P> Nonetheless , the Rwandan government claimed to have " serious , corroborated evidence . " Though the U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with Rwanda , a friend of McGuire 's told the Washington Post that McGuire was looking for a lawyer and would probably make a statement soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
