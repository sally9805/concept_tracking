An initial two-month study by the executives group , the Economic Development Council , headed by David Rockefeller , described a sluggish and overstaffed transit headquarters with inadequate resources supporting the basic mechanical operations in the garages and on the lines. // Since the report was made public early this month , the transit agency ' s president , John D. Simpson , has been meeting with council executives , and the first two members of a team of 20 business leaders are to arrive at the authority this week to begin a 12- to 18-month program of problem-solving and reorganization. <> <> 55 Management Areas Cited // The report - prepared by six executives , led by Morris Dantzker , the council president - listed 55 areas it said were suffering from poor management . Mr. Simpson ruled out six of the seven to be excluded on the ground that the authority had already begun solving those problems . They involve financial audits , research and development , broken subway car doors , maintenance yard productivity and two transit police issues. // The seventh excluded issue - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fractious headquarters operation - Mr. Simpson said he intended to handle himself. // Since it was established in 1965 , the Economic Development Council has sent executives into other city agencies , most notably the criminal-justice system , where several of the executives ' suggestions have been acted on . But this is the first time the transit system has had the help of private business executives. // The development council began looking at the transit system in January , amid deterioration of subway and bus service to what have been called the worst levels in the system ' s history . Richard Ravitch , chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority - the Transit Authority ' s parent agency - approached the council for help in seeking a $14 billion financial package from the State Legislature , and the executives first decided to investigate the system ' s management . <> <> Programs Taking Shape // Since then , the program of management assistance has begun to take shape . Walter B. Wriston , the chairman of Citicorp , has held a luncheon to begin recruiting executives , whose services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transit agency . Mayor Koch sent a letter to Mr. Ravitch , criticizing what he called the transit system ' s " operational quagmire " and applauding " the time and talent offered by the private sector . " And council officials maneuvered to avoid offending what one called " the egos " that can be rankled when executive prerogative is challenged. // The executives who will begin work at the authority this week are Edward R. Weidlein , who retired this year as senior vice president of Union Carbide Corporation , and James Gibbons , a retired general partner of Price Waterhouse , the accounting firm . Mr. Dantzker said Mr. Weidlein would work on the areas of personnel and customer service and Mr. Gibbons on materials management. // Mr. Dantzker said that commitments had been obtained so far from Bankers Trust , International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation , and the New York Life Insurance Company , among others. // Mr. Simpson , who became the Transit Authority president in January , said in an interview that he objected to any suggestion that the council had turned up issues unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully to speed the restoration of transit service. // Following are eight of the most important management problems listed by the council , along with Mr. Simpson ' s account of how they have been addressed in the past : <> <> Overstaffing at Headquarters // After looking at the Transit Authority ' s headquarters in Brooklyn , a six-member task force of the council said that the chain of command was not " as effective as it should be . " In some instances , the team said , different departments were performing the same duties . The number of people on the staff was " excessive , " it said , and there were " large numbers of staff doing no apparent work at all. " // However , Mr. Simpson said he would not let the council participate in a reorganization of headquarters , " at least in the beginning . " Asked why , he said , " This project is one we initially agreed to put on the back burner because of my intention to do some reorganization. " // A major management study completed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm , identified many organizational problems , and Mr. Simpson said he had " begun to implement a couple of the recommendations and will implement more. " // Asked for examples , he cited the shift of approval power to him from the M.T.A. board for some purchases of urgently needed parts and supplies , and a three-month " emergency " authorization to approve some other purchases . But neither example was specifically recommended in the consultants ' study and Mr. Simpson acknowledged that neither involved the organization of management inside the Transit Authority. // Mr. Simpson did not dispute the conclusion that the staff was too large . " A lot of things can and should be done , " he said , " and I am reviewing that in conjunction with the new budget next July 1. " // But he said he doubted he would be able to reduce the staff . " Many of the people have Civil Service standing , " Mr. Simpson said , " which means they will be absorbed somewhere else in the organization . There are economies that are possible and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be offset by new statutory or regulatory requirements . " <> <> Broken Subway-Car Doors // Among the main irritations for subway riders - and the reason many trains are taken out of service - is the breakdown of car doors . The task force said maintenance chiefs at the main Coney Island repair shop had said that many door malfunctions stemmed from a basic engineering problem : a chemical reaction between the door frames , made of steel , and the door sills , made of aluminum , which causes the frames to rust and the sills to buckle . The team recommended that the sills be replaced with another material. // Mr. Simpson ruled out the council ' s participation in this area , too , because , he said , the Transit Authority had already placed an order for $60 , 000 in new sills to replace those on two 20-year-old models of cars on the IND and BMT lines . This will cover repairs for about 550 of the 3 , 800 cars on those lines. // Door breakdowns have been emphasized by Mr. Simpson since last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline . But before the council study , Mr. Simpson blamed the problem on " burnout " of the doors ' motors caused by passengers ' holding the doors open too long. // He still says that burnouts and a second problem , " debris clogged in door slides , " cause 90 percent of the breakdowns , and that the authority is trying to develop a more heat-resistant motor . <> <> Computer Misuse on Records // The task force concluded that the authority ' s use of computers for record-keeping was uncoordinated and inefficient . In a few areas , too many different systems were in use or being developed , while other departments struggled along with no computerization. // At the Coney Island main repair shop , the task force noted that although there were computerized lists of repairs made on subway cars , they were not produced in a form on which high-level management could base decisions . And while there was a report prepared each week on how much workers were accomplishing , " There does not appear to be any use made of the labor-productivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the council would help in this area . He said the inefficiencies stemmed from the need for the storeroom supply system - criticized by the task force for being only 95 percent complete a decade after it was initiated - to tie in with the general accounts system , with the payroll system , and with other systems. // Mr. Simpson said that last year , when he was executive director of the M.T.A. , he " observed that the different elements of the M.T.A. were developing data systems without a central focus. " // " We strengthened the M.T.A. data center to become a clearinghouse , " he said , and coordinated authority within the Transit Authority in an assistant director for management and information . A general ledger system formerly managed by the authority ' s controller was transferred to the new department. // He denied there were any data systems producing information that was not used . The biggest problem , he said , was inadequate automation in maintenance . " There are 444 R-22 cars , " Mr. Simpson said . " If I asked what ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send someone down to go through 444 jackets , " meaning the files on each car. // However , the chief of maintenance , Edwin Weidman , earlier had described a system that could automatically print car histories , recording on a car-by-car basis each problem a car had been serviced for . Asked about that system , Mr. Simpson said that it had indeed been in place for 10 years but that nevertheless , " if I asked the question , what made a particular car lay down in service , I wouldn ' t be able to get that information . " <> <> ' Borrowing ' by Token Clerks // The task force said that delays in the accounting process for token booth revenues had allowed token clerks to " borrow " money for as long as seven weeks before shortages were detected and the clerks were billed . The executives were unable to get an estimate of how much money was lost or held up this way. // Mr. Simpson said the booth accounting problem - which the business group will work on - had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , a three-step process is in effect : // First , each clerk does his own bagging and produces a tally , and the employee receiving the bag in the " money room " checks to make sure the tallies agree . Then , turnstile counts are reconciled for each shift against the count the token clerk has submitted ; this takes several weeks . Finally , a monthly report is prepared showing the running balance for each clerk - " so we would eventually catch the guy who skimmed a nickel a day , " Mr. Simpson said . <> <> Shortage of Supervisors // The task force said the Transit Authority had far too few nonunion supervisors to provide effective supervision . " A much greater effort must be made to provide management training , " especially at the lower levels of the hierarchy , the team said . Mr. Simpson agreed to let the executives address this problem. // With a total of 45 , 000 employees , he said , the authority has only 300 management employees not represented by unions . Recognizing that many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their replacement began last summer and would be continued this year . The shortage was aggravated by personnel cuts during the city ' s fiscal crisis , he said . <> <> Unproductive Workers // Productivity standards for the 4 , 500 workers responsible for inspecting and repairing subway cars are too low and have been for years , the task force said . Even so , the task force said , many units are performing at only between 60 percent and 70 percent of the standards . " The quotas or standards being used have severely limited the effective deployment of manpower , " the team said , " and the union has consistently opposed any changes in the standards. " // Mr. Simpson said this was another area in which he had ruled out the council ' s participation . Asked why , he said , " We ' re addressing the problems. " // " We were concerned enough to hire a consultant outfit , Maynard &; Company , some months ago to conduct a study of labor output , " Mr. Simpson said. // Proposed productivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key issues leading to a strike that shut down the city ' s transit system for 11 days a year ago . The issue has remained unresolved since then. // The issue has arisen " perpetually , " Mr. Simpson said , in the authority ' s two-year cycle of contract negotiations . But Mr. Simpson said he recognized some validity in the union ' s complaint that the authority had not provided the tools and parts for workers to do their job. // " The quota that may have been arrived at in collective bargaining was strictly academic , " Mr. Simpson said . " The person at the workbench didn ' t even know what it was - what he knew was he didn ' t have the parts . That ' s why I gave procurement of parts the priority . " <> <> Poor Working Conditions // A serious personnel problem , the task force reported , was the " poor " condition of depots , yards , storerooms and other facilities . " Poor working conditions lead to low employee morale and poor productivity , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it said were below generally accepted standards in private industry . The task force urged a comprehensive review by the unions , management and the development council. // The decrepit condition of many facilities has been obvious to transit officials for many years , and Mr. Simpson will allow the business executives to work on the problem . He said major capital spending was needed. // As for work practices , he said the authority would address those again in negotiations next spring. //
