As Japan went through the third week of its death watch over the failing 87- year-old Emperor Hirohito , government leaders canceled trips and local authorities called off annual festivals . Pop concerts and weddings were postponed . Television comedies were hastily rewritten to scrub out profanity and undue frivolity . Newscasters abandoned their designer clothes for unobtrusive gray suits to match the country 's somber mood . The Japanese call this jishuku ( self-restraint ) , and they mean it . <P> Not even money seemed to matter . One TV network replaced a popular comedy show with a commercial-free program on baby elephants . The city of Nagoya dutifully passed up an anticipated $35 million windfall when it called off a grand celebration for its pennant-winning baseball team . Only the nation 's flagmakers were cashing in . " I 'm not supposed to feel happy , but our sales have zoomed more than tenfold , " said Makoto Kobayashi , president of Hinomaruya , a Tokyo flag wholesaler . <P> As the diminutive , long-reigning Hirohito struggled valiantly behind the high walls of the Imperial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationalism swept the country . Nearly 4 million people signed their names in get-well registers . Although 60% of Japan 's 123 million citizens were born after the 1947 constitution stripped the monarchy of divinity , the national vigil demonstrated that the monarchy still meant something more than the chrysanthemum crest on a ceremonial curtain . " The Emperor is the center of Japan 's national psyche , " said Seisuke Okuno , a 75-year-old Liberal Democratic member of parliament . That sentiment was not restricted to the old or the far right . The Japanese press has depicted a nation united in sorrow over the impending loss of a great spiritual leader . <P> United , but not necessarily unanimous . There were scattered calls for an examination of the Emperor 's responsibility for World War II and complaints of undue reverence in reporting his current illness . Said Norikatsu Sasagawa , 48 , professor of law at the International Christian University : " The Emperor 's health has been treated like a classified military secret . The current jishuku is just too much . " Leftist radicals showed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few blocks away from the moated palace where Hirohito lay ill , and spraying red paint near the entrance to the tumulus of the Emperor Jimmu , who may be a mythical figure but is thought by many Japanese to be first in a dynastic line stretching back nearly 2,600 years . <P> The present government , meanwhile , was wrestling with some rare but pressing decisions . Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita , for example , must choose a name for the next imperial era . All official documents except passports are now dated by the era Showa ( Enlightened Peace ) , which began the day Hirohito became Emperor in 1926 . Although some critics call the convention a remnant of the dead imperial past , they do n't wish to end it , only transfer to the people responsibility for choosing the new name .
