txt The Sporting News brings amazing tidings from the Great Southwest : The Albuquerque Dukes , a Los Angeles Dodgers ' Triple-A farm team , are tearing up the Pacific Coast League with a team batting average of .324 . Yes , a team batting average of .324 over 78 games in this Era of the Pitcher . Sportswriters of yore would have called the feat Brobdingnagian . Would that I had such flair ! I know , I know  --  the Pacific Coast League is a hitter 's paradise . At its stops at Tucson , Phoenix , Salt Lake City and , of course , Albuquerque , the summer sun bakes infields rock-hard , so that groundballs pick up the topspin of a Bjorn Borg forehand and zip past frantic fielders . In On Sports by Frederick C. Klein the light desert air , pitchers ' curveballs lose their snap and batted balls " carry " farther than in damper climes . Working conditions in the PCL are better than in the other minor leagues . The clubs travel mostly by air , and Hawaii is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who needs the Majors " But the Dukes ' record is remarkable nonetheless . As of early July , the nexthighest batting average in their league , owned by the Edmonton Eskimos , was 17 points lower . The only other Triple-A team hitting over .300 was the Wichita club of the American Association at .303 . The Major League leaders were Pittsburgh in the National League at .280 and Kansas City in the American at .288 . The Big League record ? .318 ? was set by the New York Giants in 1930 , the year Bill Terry batted .401 . No Major League team has hit .300 or more over a full season since the Boston Red Sox registered a .302 mark In 1950 . To find out what was up I phoned Del Crandall , the old catcher who once managed the Milwaukee Brewers and now manages the Dukes . " Great coaching , " he told me . But seriously folks , " we 've got talent  --  kids who can hit at just about every position , " Mr. Crandall said . " Really , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players are too good for the minors . In any organization other than the Dodgers ' , four or five of our kids would have started the season with the big club . " No position better illustrates Mr. Crandall 's point than first base . Last year , the Dukes ' man there was Mike Marshall , a 6foot-5. 220-pounder . He batted .373 , hit 34 home runs and had 137 runs batted in . At season 's end the Sporting News named him Minor League Player of the Year . The Dodgers , however , have one Steve Garvey at first base , so Mr. Marshall was back with the Dukes when this season began . What 's more , he was an outfielder , not a first baseman , because the team had Greg Brock . whom it thought might be better . Mr. Marshall was brought up to the Dodgers a few weeks ago to spell Mr. Garvey , who has been hampered by injuries . Meantime , Mr. Brock was hitting .329 with 27 homers at Albuquerque , and some believe that he . not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almost as interesting a case is that of outfielder Michael Wilson , the Dukes ' leading hitter in early July with an average of .421 . He 's a speedy type who can catch the ball , but he ca n't throw it very well , so his future with the organization is far from assured . Earlier this season , he suffered the indignity of being benched for two weeks while the Dukes played a man the Dodgers had sent down to get some work . Mr. Wilson was hitting .426 at the time . It 's not too different at some other positions . The Dukes ' shortstop is Dave Anderson . He was hitting .327. but he 's judged not yet ready to take over the spot from the Dodgers ' Bill Russell . In center field , Candy Maldonado was hitting .322 with 18 home runs , but Pedro Guerrero and Ken Landreaux are in line ahead of him in Los Angeles . Ross Jones plays a neat second base at Albuquerque , and his batting average of .287 would look good anywhere else , but young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve 's brother . Dave Sax , is with the Dukes , too , and he was hitting .355 in early July , but . .. well , you get the idea . Not surprisingly , the Dukes have been doing okay in the won-lost column as well as at the plate . In the first half of the PCL 's split season , they won the league 's Southern Division title by 10 games with a 46-25 mark . They averaged better than seven runs a game over that stretch . To say that Albuquerque fans are a bit spoiled would be to put it mildly . " Not only are the Dukes expected to win , but some people here are unhappy if they do n't score 10 or so runs , " notes Rick Wright , who covers the team occasionally for the Albuquerque Journal . And when Dukes are promoted to the big club , manager Crandall feels obliged to caution them to keep their expectations reasonable . " I tell ' em not to get too upset if they do n't get two-three hits a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell ' em that the Dodgers are n't hard people to work for . If they hit .300 or so , and play their positions well , they have a decent chance of sticking with the team . "
