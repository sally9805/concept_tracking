Creative financing 's dark side <P> Susanna Desborough is facing an embarrassing problem for a real estate agent . She is losing her own home in a foreclosure proceeding . Desborough has been unable to make the $825 monthly payments on the house in the Chatsworth section of Los Angeles , and now is more than $10,000 in arrears . Valley Federal Savings &; Loan Association , which holds the mortgage , plans to sell the house next month . Says Desborough : " The situation became like a monster that kept growing . " <P> A record number of people are facing that same beast . The Mortgage Bankers Association of America reported last week that some 140,000 U.S. homes were foreclosed during the first quarter of 1982 . Payments were delinquent on more than one out of every 20 home loans . <P> California , the pioneering land of creative mortgage financing , has had a particularly sharp rise in foreclosures . Lenders took possession of 7,163 homes throughout the state in the second half of 1981 , more than tripling the total for the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.C.L.A. Business Forecasting Project predicts that up to 8,000 residences may be foreclosed in Los Angeles County this year . That would be a 175% increase over 1981 . Says he : " This is only the beginning . It will get much worse . " <P> One of the main ways that Californians have been financing the state 's housing boom is with short-term loans in which virtually all of the principal comes due in a single so-called balloon payment , usually within two to five years . Homeowners had assumed that their houses would continue appreciating in value and that they would be able to borrow against the equity to pay off the balloon loan . But prices are now stagnating , and new loans are hard to get . Nearly $500 million of these balloon mortgages are coming due in California this year , and Shulman and other economists fear that cash-strapped homeowners will be unable to make them . <P> Many California residents also borrowed heavily against the value of their houses as real estate prices rose , and are now saddled with crushing debt . Says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get into the foreclosure process , we find that many of these buyers have taken out second , third and even fourth mortgages . " Martin says the current default rate on residential loans for his bank is twice that of a year ago . <P> As foreclosures have risen , so have the number of services that offer advice to debt-ridden householders . Mildred Todd , who lost her own home to foreclosure 15 years ago , now holds seminars for Los Angeles-area residents faced with similar problems . During a two-hour course ( cost : $20 ) , she introduces homeowners to the various legal , financial and insurance options available to them if they get in trouble with their mortgage payments . Todd , though , offers no easy solutions . Says she : " Nothing can really stop a foreclosure except cold , hard cash . "
