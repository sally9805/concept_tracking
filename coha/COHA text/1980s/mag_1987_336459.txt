The Soviet Union occasionally uses the waters of the northern Pacific as a proving ground for its arsenal of missiles . But when the Soviets test-fired two long-range missiles last week , the U.S. had cause for concern over their targets : two patches of water near Hawaii . <P> The Soviets tested a pair of modified SS-18s tipped with dummy warheads ; one missile landed 600 miles northwest of Hawaii , while another , aimed 360 miles southwest of the islands , apparently misfired . The Pentagon claimed the firings were the closest Soviet missiles had come to American soil . Said Senator Malcolm Wallop , Republican of Wyoming : " The Soviets were practicing an attack on America . " The Pentagon later acknowledged that a Soviet naval vessel aimed a laser beam at two American surveillance aircraft in the area , apparently to disrupt U.S. monitoring efforts . One pilot reportedly suffered temporary eye damage .
