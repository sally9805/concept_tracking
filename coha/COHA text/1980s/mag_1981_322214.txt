Mastectomy with a bonus tuck <P> Each year , 110,000 women in the U.S. learn that they have breast cancer . <P> For many of them , treatment is almost as dread as the disease : a mastectomy , which can be both physically and psychologically mutilating . But in recent years , plastic surgeons have devised a number of techniques for reconstructing breasts that reduce the aesthetic and emotional toll . <P> Now a new surgical procedure offers a double benefit to mastectomy patients . Using a section of fat and muscle from the abdomen , Atlanta Plastic Surgeon Dr. Carl Hartrampf replaces missing breasts and gives women a bonus " tummy tuck " in the process . A section of the rectus abdominis , one of the two large muscles that run vertically from the ribs to the pelvis , is removed , along with a surrounding island of skin and fat . The large artery supplying blood to the region is left intact . The skin of the chest is sliced free of its underlying tissue , and the entire mass is moved into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new breast is shaped and sutured into place . Finally the abdominal skin is stretched and tightened in the same procedure that is commonly used in cosmetic operations . Since the new breast has an adequate blood supply and no foreign material , it runs no risk of rejection ; all 15 operations performed by Dr. Hartrampf have been successful . -
