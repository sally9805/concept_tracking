A dreary classroom in a small Southern college . A long seminar table . Chairs sitting about at random . Enter Constance Lindell , a woman in her thirties , attractive and intelligent . She stares at the room bleakly . CONSTANCE Wonderful . ( She shrugs , smiles , drops her briefcase onto the seminar table , opens it , takes out a class list ) One , two , three . And me . She smiles again , and sets up chairs , one at each end of the table and two in the middle . Enter May Ford . She is a nervous woman in her forties , wearing a flower-print dress . MAY Creative Fiction ? CONSTANCE That 's right . MAY Are you Constance Lindell ? CONSTANCE I am . How do you do ? MAY Oh , my goodness . What a pleasure . I 'm May Ford . I 'm taking the class . CONSTANCE Good . Come in . She smiles at May , takes her briefcase to one end of the table . She opens it , takes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAY It is such a privilege to have you here . With your wonderful books . Everybody here is just  --  well , truly excited . Really we are . p. 3 CONSTANCE ( With a smile ) All three of you . MAY Three ? CONSTANCE That 's the class . MAY My goodness . And here you are , so distinguished . Oh , this college . They just do n't get the word out the way they should . They really do n't . Could I sit here ? CONSTANCE Please do . May takes one of the chairs in the middle of the table . She removes a small manuscript from a tote bag , whose side is decorated with prints of flowers . The manuscript is neatly clipped into a colored binder , which is also decorated with flower prints . Next May pulls out a small thin vase and sets it by the manuscript . She then takes from her bag tissue paper in which is wrapped a rose . She puts the rose into the vase , and smiles at Constance . MAY Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , I need some small part of God 's beautiful natural world to look at . I mean , when writers write , they have to face reality , do n't they ? I mean , they certainly need escape , do n't they ? CONSTANCE They certainly do . MAY I use flowers . What do you use ? CONSTANCE Oh , this and that . Enter , precisely on time , Suzanne Lachette , a very attractive-looking young woman , neatly dressed , and smiling a very pleasant smile . p. 4 SUZANNE Good evening . CONSTANCE Good evening . MAY Good evening . Suzanne takes the other chair in the middle of the table . She puts down a manuscript in a black spring binder , and sits . CONSTANCE Suzanne Lachette ? SUZANNE That 's right . CONSTANCE May Ford , Suzanne Lachette , and according to this class list , a Buford B  --  ( Pause ) Buford Bulla . ( Pause ) I suppose that 's the way you say that . Not here yet . SUZANNE It is time , is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute . Since there are only three of you . SUZANNE ( Pleasantly ) Only three ? Well , good . We can work in depth . Dig in . But I do think people ought to be on time . ( To May ) Do n't you ? MAY Well , I think , yes , of course , any class should begin when it should begin . It is a mark of respect for the subject and for the other pupils enrolled , but , on the other hand , perhaps Mr. Buford Bulla has n't found the right room , or maybe some car trouble ? I 'm sure he 'll be here soon , and we can all get right off to a wonderful start . She bends over quickly to smell her flower . Suzanne looks at her pleasantly , smiling . p. 5 SUZANNE I bet you would n't say that if his name was Betty instead of Buford . MAY I beg your pardon ? SUZANNE Never mind . CONSTANCE Women are used to making excuses for men ? Is that what you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CONSTANCE I suppose , some . SUZANNE More than some , I think . And I think we ought to start the class . CONSTANCE All right , if you wish . This is an extension-program course in writing fiction . One semester . Wednesdays , six to nine-thirty . My name is Constance Lindell . May applauds . Suzanne stares at her . SUZANNE Is there something I do n't know about ? MAY Her wonderful books ! Have n't you read them ? SUZANNE No . ( To Constance ) Should I have ? CONSTANCE Not at all . SUZANNE How many wonderful books are there ? CONSTANCE Two . SUZANNE Both novels ? CONSTANCE One collection of short stories . p. 6 MAY And they 're just wonderful ! Every last story ! Simply wonderful and  --  marvelous ! Really fine ! SUZANNE I 'm sure they are . I look forward to working with you , Constance . CONSTANCE And I with you , Suzanne . The course will be conducted as a workshop , without lectures . I work more like an editor than a professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow , painstaking and unglamorous labor . You both have manuscripts in progress ? SUZANNE I certainly do . MAY So do I. CONSTANCE Good . I usually try to begin without any grand statements or aesthetic pronouncements about writing , except maybe it 's a way of life more than anything else . SUZANNE ( Politely ) Excuse me . But what does that mean ? CONSTANCE Not very much , forget it . In any case , neither I nor anyone else can teach you how to write . What I can do , perhaps , is help you to teach yourself . What I can do certainly is encourage you to pay close attention to each other 's work . To each other 's struggle to write well . A class can often have insights deeper than its teacher , and within writing that seems awkward and even pre-posterous , real talent is sometimes buried . Our criticism must be candid , but I hope , always supportive . We are here to help each other . p. 7 MAY That is simply inspiring ! I am ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? CONSTANCE Why not ? SUZANNE Because two writers in one room is like two scorpions in one bottle . And teacher makes three . CONSTANCE You 've taken a writing class before . SUZANNE I sure have , in this room . With the dummy they got last year , from God knows where . After that fool , you 're lucky anybody showed up . CONSTANCE I see . So , to begin , what we need is a bit of background on each of us , including me . Let me ask you who you are , where you are from , what you are working on , and why you write . May ? MAY My name is May Ford . I 'm from Fontana , ten miles away . My husband is in the furniture business . I have three children , eleven , thirteen , and fourteen , and my hobbies are roses and needlepoint . SUZANNE ( Quietly ) And writing . MAY Yes , I suppose you can call it a hobby . The book I am working on is a novel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman who finds herself in middle age , and at the end of all pleasure , and who is redeemed by the beauty of the natural world she discovers around her . I am having a little trouble with it . p. 8 SUZANNE ( Quietly ) I bet you are . MAY Why do I write ? Well . ( Pause . She thinks about it carefully ) Because I need to . I need to believe that in spite of everything , there is the same purpose and goodness in human beings that there is in God 's wonderful natural world , and if we seek , we will find . CONSTANCE Thank you . Suzanne ? SUZANNE My name is Suzanne Lachette . I live here in town . I work at the University Medical Center , as a lab technician . Divorced , at last . One child , a female , thank God . I am also writing a novel . It is about a woman ending her marriage , and facing life as it is . The title is Scaulded Dogs . It 's coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy . Writing is the only way I can say something and keep it the way I said it . How 's that ? CONSTANCE Just fine . I 'm Constance Lindell , from Chapel Hill , North Carolina . Also divorced , remarried , my husband teaching this term in another school . No children . I am working on a novel , too , no title yet , and at the moment anyway , I think I became a writer because I could n't do anything else . Henry Miller said somewhere , if you just get desperate enough , you 'll write , and I think that is what happened to me . SUZANNE You read Henry Miller ? p. 9 CONSTANCE With pleasure . SUZANNE Yuck . CONSTANCE ( Smiling ) What 's wrong with Henry Miller ? SUZANNE ( Smiling ) He wrote with his penis . MAY Oh ! I mean , well , people will write for all kinds of reasons , wo n't they ? SUZANNE Henry Miller was the worst example of male arrogance in all literature . He thought women were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I do . The procedure of this workshop is simple . A chapter , or a section ten to twenty pages long , is read aloud , then discussed . MAY Read aloud ? But is n't that vulgar ? CONSTANCE Vulgar , May ? MAY Maybe not vulgar , exactly , but common , surely . I mean , the whole purpose of writing is to say beautiful things in silent print , instead of just blabbing about it like everybody else , is n't it ? So to read what 's written aloud , is to make it back into what you did n't want it to be in the first place . Is n't it ? CONSTANCE ( Slowly ) I think I see what you mean . But reading manuscripts aloud in class is the only practical way we can focus on it together , at the same time . p. 10 SUZANNE Excuse me . We could read them before we came in . CONSTANCE That means copies have to be made , for one thing , and manuscripts do n't get read , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . It takes up the slack . SUZANNE And lots of class time . But all right . I see your point . Fine with me . CONSTANCE One more thing . When a manuscript is read , before we jump in with critical judgments , I ask for a period where only questions are asked . Logistical matters . Who was where when what happened , and so on . To clear things up , so that what is not clear gets all sorted out , and we know what the writer was trying to do , even if he did n't always succeed . SUZANNE Or she . CONSTANCE Or she . SUZANNE I have a question now . CONSTANCE All right . SUZANNE How many other courses have they got you teaching ? Pause . Constance stares at Suzanne a second , takes a deep breath . CONSTANCE Three . SUZANNE Freshman comp ? CONSTANCE Two . One survey of world lit . For sophomores. p. 11 SUZANNE That must be difficult . Plus office hours , I would think , and plenty of advising . CONSTANCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not exactly an artist in residence here , are you ? CONSTANCE I think I said before that writing is a way of life more than anything else . Plenty of good writers , like me thank you , are in exactly the same boat . But that is n't the point . The point is , am I going to conduct this course , or are you ? SUZANNE You , if you can . Frankly , I 'm doubtful . MAY Do we get to have coffee breaks , or anything like that ? I sure could use one . CONSTANCE We break after something is read . And I suppose Mr. Bullough is n't coming after all , so let 's start . Who would like to go first ? SUZANNE I defer to any novel as much about plants as people . Go ahead , May . MAY Oh , no ! Scaulded Dogs is such a brilliant title . I know it will be just overwhelming . I 'd be scared to death to go before that . You first , please . SUZANNE No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think I can . We know you can . So , please do . p. 12 SUZANNE I would n't think of it . Gridlock . ( She smiles at Constance . ) Constance ? Ready for her , Constance flips a coin . CONSTANCE Heads , May . Tails , Suzanne . ( She catches the coin , slaps it onto the table , looks at it ) It 's tails . Suzanne . MAY Thank God . SUZANNE Let me see that , please . ( She gets up and peers over at the coin ) Very well . Suzanne goes back to her seat and prepares to read her manuscript . She checks her chair , and gets set in her position at the table . She centers her spring binder in front of her . She thinks a minute . She clears her throat , and begins to read aloud.Scaulded Dogs . Chapter One.Frank came in the door without ringing the bell , of course . The familiar lurch showed Laurinda that he had already been drinking , although her mother 's clock on their fireplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't expecting you , " she said gently . " It 's still my house , " he said sneering . " Even with you in it . " Melinda felt like the head of a big kitchen match , rasped across a hot stove , struck into sulphur and fire . But she bowed her head , and said nothing . Constance puts one hand briefly over her face , and summons up powers of endurance . May radiates a look of serious appreciation . p. 13 MAY Oh , that 's wonderful . Powerful . That match thing . What a metaphor . SUZANNE It 's a simile , not a metaphor . ( To Constance ) I beg your pardon , but we do get to read uninterrupted , do n't we ? MAY Oh , I 'm sorry ! ( She claps her hands over her mouth ) CONSTANCE Yes , you do . MAY I wo n't say another word ! CONSTANCE It 's all right , May . Sometimes it is useful to take notes while someone is reading , so you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . May takes her notepad and pen and is quickly poised to take her notes . SUZANNE ( Reading aloud ) Frank looked at the open ledger book into which Laurinda had just listed their common possessions . " What you get and what I get , eh ? " he said , squinting at her hard work with contempt . " Bet I know how that works out . " Since Laurinda had been scrupulous in her fair division of their property , this stung her bitterly , but she put it behind her , to face as bravely as she could a more vital issue . " You did n't come for the children yesterday , when you said you would . They were expecting you . " He dismissed her words with one wave of his hand . " Well , something came up , " he said , minimizing the wounds he had inflicted on his own children . " I have to make money , after all . To keep you in ease and comfort , not to mention your lawyer . Ha ha . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May makes industrious notes.That was his idea of a joke . Laurinda stared at him . To think she had once given him her love , and thought him capable of its return . What treachery . There he stood , a smug , self-satisfied , domineering drunk . An intolerant , arbitrary bully . A superficial , narrow-minded , short-sighted , besotted provincial bigot . A self-indulgent , flatulent , gruesome eyesore of a man , odious and repellent , a repulsive buffoon ! Enter Buford Bullough , with a lurch and a stagger . He carries a cardboard box and a battered portable phonograph . Buford is a wreck . He sweats . His eyes bulge , stare wildly ahead of him , as if seeing , somewhere in space , something astounding . He wears a worn hunting shirt , jeans and jacket , heavy boots and a baseball cap . His hair is all unkempt . He puts the box down at one end of the table and sits quickly . In one hand he carries a can of jumbo-size soda , open . He drinks from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wipes his face . The three women stare at him , speechless . p. 14 BUFORD Sorry ah 'm late . Just pay me no mind . CONSTANCE Mr. Bulla ? BUFORD Bull-loo . Bewford Bull-loo . CONSTANCE Mr. Bullough , then . May Ford . Suzanne Lachette . BUFORD Hidy . SUZANNE Good evening . MAY Hello theah . CONSTANCE Go ahead , Suzanne . ( To Buford ) First chapter of a novel . BUFORD Ah see . ( He puts his chin on his hand , elbow on the table , and stares at Suzanne with fierce concentration ) SUZANNE ( Reading aloud ) So once again Laurinda saw there was no possible way to communicate with Frank . None at all . " Frank , " Laurinda said . " I had hoped you would think of the children if not of me . Some tincture of grace I had hoped for , to color this bitter medicine we must take . " Buford 's attention span snaps . He reaches down and with one hand opens the top of the cardboard box . He sees Suzanne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Correction , " said Frank . " You must take . I am still a healthy human being . " It was hopeless . " Very well , " she sighed . " What do you want , Frank ? " " I want what 's mine , " said Frank . " And a lot of it is in this room right now . " Buford looks at the cardboard box . " All right , Frank , " said Laurinda , patiently . " I have done my best . You look and see what you think should be yours instead of mine . I 'll consider any changes you may suggest . " Buford reaches into the cardboard box . " You 'd better , " said Frank . " I just might take it all . Or smash it all , every stick . How would you like that , lady ? " Buford takes out a bottle of bourbon . Turning slightly , and holding the bottle below the table , he pours bourbon into his soda can.Oh , Laurinda thought , the brute . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married him ? Buford puts the bottle back in the box , and takes from it a huge manuscript , tied by a rope . It is composed of many sections , each novel length , held by a rubber band . He puts the manuscript on the table and stares at it.There he stood , his whiskey breath plain as the scent of a skunk , still weaving in front of her , a slack-jawed , leering , childish , smart aleck of a man , a swine absolute and unmitigated , a boorish , filthy-minded  --  Suzanne stops reading and slams her spring binder shut.Since it is blatantly obvious that Mr. Bullough does not care to listen to my work , I will not continue to read it ! p. 15 MAY Oh , Suzanne ! Do n't stop ! That was all just wonderful ! SUZANNE May , you try it . It 's a bit difficult to read aloud the deepest meditations of your heart and soul , with a man unpacking a suitcase , like somebody going fishing . Not to mention slipping whiskey into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiskey ? BUFORD Bourbon . Ah need it . SUZANNE I 'm sure you do . BUFORD Lady , ah certainly am sorry if ah bothered you . SUZANNE My name is not Lady . It is Suzanne Lachette . La  --  chette ! BUFORD Miz Lachette , ah certainly did n't mean to . Ah was listening . SUZANNE Oh , please ! BUFORD It 's just that well , you see , ah 'm here to do it , and ah , well , it 's just inside me all the time like a drum going boom-boom-boom all the time . It do n't never stop , so ah have to get ready , you see . I mean , boom-boom-boom ! Hit 's awful . You will understand . SUZANNE If your writing , Mr. Bullough , is no more illuminating than your speech , that is not very likely . CONSTANCE ( To Suzanne ) You 're sure you wo n't continue ? p. 16 SUZANNE Positive . CONSTANCE Would you like us to discuss what you 've read ? SUZANNE Hardly . I can not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man obviously interested in nothing but himself . CONSTANCE Very well . May ? MAY ( Terrified ) What ? CONSTANCE Would you read instead ? MAY You mean out loud right now ? CONSTANCE You 're next . Why not ? MAY Oh , no ! I better wait a little while . I mean , like the flowers I always seem to write about , my story is delicate and needs a little sunshine , and good weather , you see . BUFORD ( Explosively ) Well , me then ! Ah 'm willing to read ! Ah 'm willing to read ! SUZANNE What a surprise . BUFORD Ah mean , if hit 's my turn . Ah do n't want to step out of line or nothing . SUZANNE Out of line or nothing . Jesus Christ . CONSTANCE Well , Mr. Bullough , since neither Suzanne or May want to read , go ahead . p. 17 BUFORD Ah will ! ( He tears into his huge manuscript , going through its many sections , searching for something ) SUZANNE He 's like a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin , you see . MAY How about the beginning , dear Mr. Bullough ? SUZANNE Or the end . Buford finds the portion of his manuscript he wants to read . BUFORD Here ! Ah got hit . Now he plugs his phonograph into a wall socket . From the box he takes a record in a faded dust jacket . He puts it on the table face down . SUZANNE Music yet . What are you going to play for us , Bullough ? " Hound Dog ? " " Detour ? " " The Great Speckled Bird ? " Pause . Buford stares at his manuscript . He takes a deep breath , drinks quickly from his soda can , wipes his forehead with his kerchief . Then he begins to read . From the moment he does , Constance , who has been managing all this as best she can , comes at once to a different life . BUFORD ( Reading aloud , at breakneck speed ) On her bed , beneath the candleflame headboard that guarded her descent into bitterness and where perhaps madness overtook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a woman named Edna Craig Somebody blundering around in the bathroom , picked up at the Paramount Paradise  --  p. 18 SUZANNE Just a minute . BUFORD  --  Roadhouse four miles out of Ridersberg  --  SUZANNE Just a minute ! Buford stops reading , looks wildly about . BUFORD Whut ? SUZANNE The title . You forgot the title . BUFORD Huh ? SUZANNE Title ! Name of the thing . What it is called , for God 's sake ! BUFORD Oh . The whole thing is just a man 's name . But this part is called F.M . SUZANNE F.M . what ? I do n't understand . BUFORD Just F.M . MAY You mean F period M period ? BUFORD Yes , ma'am . MAY Then I do n't understand either . How can you call something by some initials , and we do n't even know if it is a somebody or a something or what it is ? SUZANNE I mean , is it Frequency Modulation , or Fred Mac-Murray , or what ? BUFORD Oh , it means something , but that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 19 CONSTANCE Mr. Bullough , you do n't have to have your titles yet . Titles are funny . They come before , during and after a book . Let 's say F.M . for the moment means Fiction Material . How 's that ? BUFORD That 's fine ! Fiction Material ! SUZANNE Or Freak Mouth . CONSTANCE Go ahead , then . BUFORD Ah 'll commence again . SUZANNE " Commence again . " Then he reads a sentence half a page long . BUFORD ( Reading aloud , slower ) On her bed , beneath the candleflame headboard that guarded her descent into bitterness and where perhaps madness overtook her , he lay dreaming , drunk and naked , with a woman named Edna Craig Somebody blundering around in the bathroom , picked up at the Paramount Paradise Roadhouse four miles out of Ridersberg , and brought to his mother 's small house with shrieks and giggles  --  MAY Mother ? Did he say mother ? SUZANNE I do n't know . Buford makes a change in his manuscript , with a big felt marker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors on their porches shook their heads in their chairs and rocked their disapproval  --  not a day in the ground , they said , not even twelve hours  --  and he tried now to focus  --  ( He makes another change )  --  he tried to spend his whirling powers upon the thin body , the delicate , thorny foxfire woman he had buried that morning , tried to summon her back to him , with all her smiles and rings , her hands on her own breasts , and all her Chinese puzzles , if not to answer his questions framed apart from her for ten years , at least to speak to him who had not heard her voice for ten years , and listening all that time to Edna Craig Somebody , the large and friendly creature in the bathroom . " How do you turn this light off in here ? " said Edna Craig . " By the wall cabinet . " " Oh , yeah . " May and Suzanne look at each other in dismay.There was a pause while she found the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Change with the marker )  --  came out of the bathroom into the hall . " Hey ! This here old thing a radio ? " " Yes . " " Can I play it ? " " Why not ? " " Let 's have some music then . What the hell . " " Go ahead . " " You want me to ? " " I said yes . " Drunk , naked , and dreaming , he lay in her bed , under the candleflame headboard . Mama ? Mama ? Which flowers grew where  --  p. 20 SUZANNE Wait a minute . BUFORD  --  he could never remember  --  SUZANNE Wait a minute ! BUFORD  --  and certainly  --  SUZANNE WAIT A MINUTE ! BUFORD Huh ? Whut ? SUZANNE I do n't understand one word of this . BUFORD Whut if ah just keep on going ? Maybe you will . SUZANNE May , do you know what this man is saying ? MAY Not exactly . There 's a man who 's brought a woman somewhere  --  SUZANNE And put her in the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed is it , whose town is it , who is he and what is he doing ? MAY I certainly do n't know . CONSTANCE ( Quietly ) It is his mother 's house . He has buried her that morning . Now to her bed , he has brought a woman from a roadhouse . Is that right , Mr. Bullough ? BUFORD Yes , ma'am . SUZANNE Ugh . That is the most sordid premise for a story in the history of fiction . p. 21 BUFORD Yes , ma'am . Ah got to go ahead with this . Once ah commence reading , hit 's awful to stop . SUZANNE " Commence " again . Did you really write all that purple prose , Bullough ? You do n't talk that way . You talk like a hick . BUFORD I know it . Hit 's whut ah am . But hit 's different when ah write . I reckon that 's why ah do it . CONSTANCE Go on , Mr. Bullough . ( To May and Suzanne ) Take notes and let him read . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . May and Suzanne ready their notepads . Buford plunges in once more.Which flowers grew where , he could never remember , and certainly along that road , that hill , those cowpaths  --  SUZANNE ( Writing note ) Cowpaths . BUFORD ( Reading aloud )  --  and between these birches , he can not remember them all , all the biology bookful of flowers that in his lifetime before he left her passed from his tiny mother 's waspish hands to his . ( Pause ) Mama ? Mama ? SUZANNE ( Writing note ) Mamamama . BUFORD ( Reading aloud ) He twists about in her bed , and now reaches up to touch the candleflame headboard and suddenly she is there with him , she speaks to him as he lies naked and dreaming of her , moving toward him through a forest of gigantic flowers , and he sees again their pictures in the books and in the articles she cut out for him , and he sees them lying at their feet during the walks they took through the soft Southern air of his childhood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , white baneberry , whose stalks redden with age , whose china-white fruit is poisonous and gleams in the shade , and she says to him , Oh , my darling , my heart is full of love for you , here , it 's in here , touch my breast here  --  p. 22 MAY Touch what ? SUZANNE My God . BUFORD ( Reading aloud )  --  while they walk , over bloodroot poppy , pink as dawn , when crushed giving a scarlet liquid useful , she tells him , as war paint , dye , and it can even change the color of a man 's eye , and she says , Kiss me , my son , my only child , my darling boy , passing lank green swaths of wild yam and meadowrue , where they stop and he kisses his mother , bereft forever of the passion she seeks in him . They embrace , surrounded by nodding suns of black-eyed Susans , yellow sweet-clover , turkscap lilies and four-leaf loose-strife , Solomonplume orange with stems that zigzag and berries green and red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't zigzag . BUFORD ( Reading aloud ) And then the laughter , sweet and soft at first , and her eyes not yet wild , her voice not yet hard or cold , Well , darling , come along , if you do n't understand how much your mother loves you , you just do n't , it 's all right come along . Her stride picks up , over scarlet fireweed , bull thistle and thimbleberry , and he is desperate to follow her . MAY ( Note ) Some of those are not even real flowers . p. 23 BUFORD ( Reading aloud ) Her laughter becomes shrill now and hard , her step begins to rush along the path above the little town her prison , over crowpoison and Allegheny goatsbeard , whose brownish blossoms become quickly infested with insects . She turns to look back at him , and her stare goes through him now like a needle into cloth . ( He looks at the phonograph ) Got this music to play right here . It goes with it real good . He takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on the phonograph . Suzanne picks up the jacket . SUZANNE Where did he get this ? She passes it to Constance , who looks at the faded jacket thoughtfully . MAY It is n't right to make up flowers any way you want to . Flowers are more important than that . They do n't mean anythig but themselves . I do n't like this . CONSTANCE ( Looking at the jacket ) Edward Elgar . The music plays . It is the beginning of the second movement of Elgar 's Piano Quintet in A Minor . Buford reads aloud again , slower now . BUFORD From the ground , picking them up laughing , she makes for him dreaming as once she did in life , out of three leaves from a fig tree , some cellophane from her purse  --  laced with pine straw and a rooster 's comb of common daisies and with flowers cascading down its back  --  a bridal crown . She holds it out , laughing at him , the eyes dangerous now , as she tries to put it on his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was beautiful , son , beautiful as the day we share in this place of flowers , with our bond singing in our blood .

Let me see , in your face , the bride I was , let me kiss myself upon your lips , angels the two of us , on earth , in gardens of delight . May jumps up , exploding . p. 24 MAY I will not have it ! ! I will not have it ! ! Shut off that awful music or I will break the damn record ! BUFORD Please ! Ah ca n't stop now ! MAY Yes you can ! You pervert ! ( She takes the arm off the record , stopping the music ) You listen to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not the kind to get mad . But you make me want to blow you up with dynamite . I want to kill you ! CONSTANCE Sit down , May . Why do you want to kill Mr. Bullough ? SUZANNE Constance , when you cant ' even handle a writing course , why start group therapy ? CONSTANCE Because I feel like it , Suzanne . Let 's have it , May . MAY I want to kill him because of the flowers . This degraded , obscene writing takes the beauty of flowers and makes them part of some disgusting incest between a crazy mother and an infantile son , and if that 's what people want to write about , all right , but leave God 's clean sweet gentle flowers out of it ! They do n't deserve to be in hell where this madman obviously is , but here on earth with the real and the true and the good ! SUZANNE Way to go , May . I could't have said that better myself . MAY Thank you , Suzanne . p. 25 SUZANNE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this . Constance ? CONSTANCE ( To Buford ) Read ! BUFORD " Hey ! " the woman yelled from the hall . " You still there ? " " Yes , Edna Craig . " " I ca n't get no good music on this God damned radio . Just a lot of fiddles . " That 's short wave . You get Europe with it . " " But not WRD in Ridersberg , huh ? What the hell ? " " Forget it . Come to bed . " " Oh . All right . " And she did , to his mother 's bed , to lie with him beneath the carved candleflame headboard , where , against linen-slipped feather pillows which clung in the damp Ridersville night delightfully to the skin , he took off her cheap clothes , slowly , while eyes closed , Edna Craig Somebody moaned , breathed heavily , as sudden in lust as in roadhouse friendship , churning through the bed with her large hips until she saw him holding himself back , and staring at her . She folded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if about to pat her hair , set herself somehow right , uncertain of him . " Honey , come on . Do it . What 's wrong ? " " Nothing . " " Yes , there is . Is it me ?

Do n't fret . Put your head here on Mama 's tits and get some rest . " p. 26 MAY Oh ! SUZANNE Oh , vomit ! Vomit ! BUFORD ( Reading aloud ) He woke from sleeping against her , refreshed , as if both their bodies had undergone a seachange , and when he reached for her now , it was with purpose . She opened herself to receive him . In mutual relief , and a taking of chance-grafted flesh , they moved each into the other until they were struck , held , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope ! SUZANNE Is that really the conclusion , finally , of this nauseating exhibition of antifemale pornography ? BUFORD No ! Course not ! He has to wake up and see his mama again ! SUZANNE I knew it !

And I mean to complain , to the Dean of this college . My trust has been betrayed . SUZANNE We 'll both complain . ( To Constance ) Which wo n't do you any good here , I 'll tell you that . ( To Buford ) As for you , just one question . What kind of a mother did you have , anyway ? p. 27 CONSTANCE What kind of a mother did you have , Suzanne ? SUZANNE What did you say ?

( To Constance ) Ah 'm sorry to have bothered you . Ah never meant to get you in no trouble . Constance walks slowly to Buford . There is a chair tucked against the table . She pulls it out , turns it about , sets it next to Buford , below the table by his chair , about four feet away from him . CONSTANCE Give me the bottle . Buford hands her the bottle of bourbon . Constance starts to drink , stops , puts the needle on the record again , sits . The same music plays again.Read on , Buford . Read on . She listens , and when he begins to read , she takes a long slow drink from the bottle . p. 29 BUFORD When he woke , the harsh morning sun was a glare against his mother 's bedroom window .

Bought in Tennessee , by his grandfather , and he himself born beneath it . And there , above his ear , his mother called to him once more , in a voice clear , and with laughter quiet , as if it was only a complicated joke they shared together . And he was her again , in freedom , shorn of all her burdens , his mother within a burning garden of wood , and to the woman whose hands had broken him , but in whose smiles was his hope , and from whose pain came his understanding , he said , Goodbye . Music . Pause . Looking ahead , Constance reaches out her hand , and Buford , looking ahead , takes it .                                         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
