Each man films the thing he loathes . That seems the rule , anyway , for directors who investigate the darker locales in cinema 's emotional landscape . Alfred Hitchcock , Luis Bunuel , Federico Fellini found artistry in images that terrified or disgusted them . Their bad dreams became their best movies . <P> Thus it is with the gifted Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg . Images of corporal corruption  --  of malefic birth and voracious organs  --  stalk his They Came from Within , Rabid , The Brood , Scanners and Videodrome . Heads explode , and monsters issue from the wombs of women . In Cronenberg 's masterwork , The Fly , one man wages a heroic , doomed struggle against physical and moral degeneration ; his body has a twisted mind of its own . The catalog of punishments seems medieval  --  Savonarola meets Bosch  --  even as it taps baby boomers ' fears of decaying vitality and eviscerated dreams . For Cronenberg the body is a haunted house whose rumblings trigger lust , mystery and excruciating pain in the poor tenant . This property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , driven to dementia and a symbiotic murder-suicide by urges that both share but neither understands , seems a scenario only Cronenberg could dream up . In fact , the story comes from the novel Twins , by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland , which in turn was based on the case history of Drs . Cyril and Stewart Marcus , a pair of respected gynecologists who in 1975 were found dead in a Manhattan apartment . From these threads Cronenberg has spun a fantasia of split personality and the vulnerable male ego . The film 's identical twins , Elliot and Beverly Mantle ( both played by Jeremy Irons ) , are Toronto doctors with a reputation for radical technique and a comforting bedside manner . The rep is , in a way , only half earned . Ellie is the suave salesman ; Bev is the genius of research . Cool Ellie is the connoisseur of female flesh ; nerdy Bev probes deeper for his elusive womanly ideal . He wishes there were beauty contests for the insides of bodies . <P> Then Claire Niveau ( Genevieve Bujold ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous actress with a healthy sexual appetite , a trifurcate cervix and the desperate yen to bear a child . Desire stirs Bev 's instincts ; propriety tries to tamp them down . It is a dangerous move to admit someone besides Ellie into his secret life . Love for an outsider will distort the twins ' delicate imbalance . They had been complementary halves of one identity : body and mind , curiosity and compassion , sex and guilt , Don Juan and Don Knotts . Now the seesaw must tip from sanity to psychosis . <P> At times Dead Ringers also tilts out of coherence , with scenes that are dramatically stillborn . But Irons is splendid in both roles , and Cronenberg can create tour-de-force tableaux with his effortless black magic . In one , Bev strides into surgery dressed in red , like a demon priest at a sacrificial rite . The victim is woman ; her crime is woman 's unique advantage over man , the power to produce perfect new bodies from the most vulnerable part of her own . Any mad scientist , any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to destroy it . And Bev must finally love the two things he kills : a woman 's procreative strength , and his own better , brotherly half .
