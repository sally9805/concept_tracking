THE BEST OF MODERN HUMOR <P> Edited by Mordecai Richler <P> Knopf ; 400 pages ; $17.95 <P> Dying is easy , " said Actor Edmund Gwenn at the end of his life . " Comedy is difficult . " Perhaps that is why so many writers shun the genre . But there is a more salient reason . As Woody Allen sadly observes , " When you do comedy , you are not sitting at the grownups ' table . " <P> In this rich compendium , Novelist Mordecai Richler attempts to lift humorists out of the high chair and onto the Louis Quinze . He ransacks old collections and ranges through the century , from Stephen Leacock to Fran Lebowitz . Anything that smacks of adolescence is jettisoned : " You will meet with no Dorothy Parker here ... I found her comic stories brittle , short on substance . " And nothing mild is allowed : to go through Robert Benchley 's work is " to discover a good many of his sketches astonishingly bland , disarmingly gentle . " The 65 pieces that pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of them are also funny . But they are no more mature than the Falstaff put down by Prince Hal : " How ill white hairs become a fool and jester ! " <P> Take the first entry , Leacock 's Gertrude the Governess : " It was a wild and stormy night on the West Coast of Scotland . This , however , is immaterial to the present story , as the scene is not laid in the West of Scotland . " That kind of screwball is still pitched effectively by Monty Python , but it is not a sign of seniority . Virginia Woolf believed that Ring Lardner had " talents of a remarkable order . " And so he had . But the episode from You Know Me Al leans hard on misspelling and false naivet , favorite devices of the novice : " Florrie thinks she has got to have a new dress though she has got two changes of cloths now and I do n't know what she can do with another one . " <P> The best of The Best of Modern Humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the pique of his powers . In Farewell , My Lovely Appetizer he skewers Raymond Chandler : " I stared at her ears , liking the way they were joined to her head . There was something complete about them ; you knew they were there for keeps . When you 're a private eye , you want things to stay put . " Later , in Yma Dream , Thomas Meehan offers a Carrollian nightmare in which the Misses Chaplin , Sumac , Gardner , Gabor , et al. , and the Messrs . Eban , Ehrenburg , Betti , etc. , are introduced to Miss Hagen , the actress : " Uta , Yma ; Uta , Ava ; Uta , Oona ; Uta , Ona ; Uta , Ida ; Uta , Ugo ; Uta , Abba ; Uta , Ilya ; Uta , Ira ; Uta , Aga ; Uta , Eva .
