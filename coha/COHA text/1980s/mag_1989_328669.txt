The dramatic photographs that appear in these pages were taken by astronauts aboard U.S. space shuttles . The pictures provide clear evidence that the earth is in grave danger as a result of human activity . Overpopulation , pollution and energy consumption have created such planet-wide problems as massive deforestation , ozone depletion and the global warming that is believed to be caused by the greenhouse effect . Yet these alarming trends , and how they interact with such natural phenomena as hurricanes and volcanoes , are still not fully understood by scientists . <P> Major help in studying the earth 's environment is expected to emerge from a project being planned by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration . Called Mission to Planet Earth , the program would consist of a series of satellite flights designed to monitor the earth with sensitive instruments that measure such vital signs as temperature , winds and atmospheric chemistry . These readings would add immensely to the knowledge gained from high- resolution photography alone . The object is to understand the planet 's dynamics well enough to anticipate ecological disasters  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested in 1987 by a study group led by Sally Ride , America 's first woman in space . <P> - Mission to Planet Earth would go a long way toward answering critics who have insisted that the U.S. space program has for years had no clear mission . If NASA gets the go-ahead , the project , which would cost an estimated $20 billion over the next two decades , could begin by 1996 with the launching of the first of a pair of 15-ton unmanned space platforms called the earth- observing system ( EOS ) . Designed to operate for at least 15 years , the satellites would give scientists their first comprehensive look at just how the world 's environment changes over time . Detectors would monitor the shrinking of the tropical rain forests as well as of the polar ice caps ( a possible consequence of global warming ) . One instrument would measure the stress of pollution on the leaves of trees , while another would monitor the health of small ponds . Data from all the detectors would be correlated in an unprecedented effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> But President Bush has not yet endorsed the program , and funding is uncertain . While NASA has $24.2 million of EOS start-up money in its fiscal 1990 budget , the big push for Mission to Planet Earth will begin this fall , when the agency asks for $100 million more for 1991 . That hardly seems too much for a long-term commitment to help save the planet .
