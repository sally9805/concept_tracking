txt Iran 's response yesterday to U.S. proposals to free the hostages has brought an agreement much closer . U.S. officials said . The response accepted most of the American ideas but included a significant change  --  a proposal to speed the return of Iran 's frozen assets in Europe . Iran 's offer calls for transferring all of its frozen- assets in European branch banks to an escrow account even before Iran has settled its loans with those banks . U.S. officials say . A sizeable sum of money would then be put aside to repay the loans . The advantage . U.S. officials say . is that the timeconsuming process of settling the loans would be postponed until after the hostages are freed rather than before as the American proposal had envisioned . " Our reading is that it 's a good offer , " says a Carter administration official familiar with the Iranian proposal . " But we have to consult the banks . " Banks Seek Assurances The banks involved have been eager for Iran to bring its loans up to date before any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking assurances that they wo n't be legally liable to Iran 's creditors if they release the frozen funds . An estimated $4.8 billion of Iranian assets were frozen in European branches of U.S. banks by President Carter on Nov. 14 , 1979 . As much as $1.5 billion of that has been used by the banks to offset loan payments Iran stopped making after the freeze . Under Iran 's proposal , all $4.8 billion would be transferred to the escrow account as soon as a U.S.-Iranian deal is struck . Late yesterday . Iran appeared to be pressuring the U.S. for a quick response to the offer . Iran 's chief negotiator . Behzad Nabavi. was quoted by Tehran Radio as saying the U.S. must transfer an " adequate " amount of money to Algerian banks by the close of business Friday or Iran 's interest in an agreement might change . " Should there be no action to this by the end of business hours Friday , the circumstances will radically change from the standpoint of the Iranian government , - Mr. Nabavi said . Nonetheless , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ' very close . The Iranians clearly want to resolve this while we 're in office . " LT.S. officials say Iran appears willing to accept the remainder of the American proposal . Under that plan , the U.S. would transfer $2.5 billion in the Federal Reserve Bank in New York to an escrow account in Bonn or London for release to Iran as soon as the hostages were freed . Another $2.2 billion in Iranian assets frozen in U.S. banks would remain in those banks until about $5 billion in claims against the money were transferred to an international commission . As for Iran 's latest offer , the State Department said initially in a statement that the proposal " warrants close and intensive study " by U.S. negotiators . " Until we have an opportunity to evaluate the Iranian response , we ca n't predict whether it will enable the parties to resolve their remaining differences . " the statement added . Series of Positive Signs Iran 's response was the latest in a series of positive signs . Earlier this week . Iran 's parliament signaled its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international commission to settle American claims against about $2.2 billion of Iranian assets frozen in the U.S. Officials also are heartened by statements by Iranian leaders indicating they want to rid themselves of the hostage issue . " One thing that is clear is that they very much want to put an end to this thing , " says one Carter administration official . Nevertheless . U.S. officials remain cautious . They note that solutions have appeared close several times in the past . but in each case efforts to end the ordeal broke down . In particular , they note that a solution seemed close last month until Iran stunned American negotiators by demanding that the U.S. deposit $24 billion in Algeria to guarantee return of Iranian assets . That demand has since been dropped . Day Ahead of Deadline Iran 's latest response arrived just a day ahead of the Jan. 16 deadline once imposed for an agreement with the Carter administration . But in recent days the administration , sensing progress , has indicated that it is willing to negotiate until President Carter leaves office next Tuesday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $2.2 billion of Iranian assets frozen in domestic branches of U.S. banks . About $5 billion in claims have been filed against this money , and President Cartci would use his authority to take the claims out of courts and transfer them to an international claims commission . Iran would receive its assets as soon as Mr. Carter 's authority to move the claims was upheld . Meanwhile , Iran would deposit between $1 billion and $2 billion in an escrow account from which claims would be paid . Meeting With Khomeini Some U.S. officials think that any agreement by Iran may yet have to be approved by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini . Iran 's religious leader . Yesterday , Iran 's Prime Minister Mohammed Ali Rajai and Mr. Nabavi , met with Ayatollah Khomeini . Tehran Radio did n't give any details but said Mr. Rajai and his cabinet met for four hours before the meeting with the Ayatollah .
