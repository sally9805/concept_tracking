In the rolling Virginia countryside some 30 miles from Washington , Confederate troops bloodied Union armies twice in the Civil War battles of Manassas . Now Manassas is up in arms again , this time over a 20th century invader : a 1.2 million-sq. - ft. shopping center that is being bulldozed on a site that served as Robert E. Lee 's headquarters in 1862 . " Greed is fighting a battle with our heritage , " charges Annie Snyder , leader of the Save the Battlefield Coalition , a group struggling to protect the 540 acres adjacent to Manassas National Battlefield Park . " Developers want to pave over ground where brave men are buried . " <P> The latest battle of Manassas began in earnest last January when Hazel/ Peterson Co. , the largest land developers in northern Virginia , joined Edward DeBartolo , the nation 's biggest shopping-center developer , to propose the mall , complete with new highway intersections , commuter parking lots and high- rise office buildings . Down came a barrage of hostile fire from outraged Civil War buffs , including Actor Charlton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descendant of nine Manassas veterans . Ground where 4,200 soldiers gave their lives , say the preservationists , should not be overwhelmed by noise , traffic and pollution from up to 85,000 mall-bound cars a day . <P> The area in contention , known as Stuart 's Hill , is adjacent to the park along the Warrenton Turnpike , which cuts through the heart of the battlefield . At the second battle of Manassas in 1862 , the hill served as the staging ground for General James Longstreet 's counterattack , which led to a Confederate victory . <P> Developers and spokesmen for the local government claim that the site is " historically insignificant . " The location of the actual fighting , they point out , is well preserved within the national park , and a Hazel/Peterson spokesman insists that the mall architects have gone to great lengths to make sure most of the buildings will not be seen by tourists . Moreover , while historians estimate that 155 men died on or near the hill , a survey of the mall property uncovered only the grave of a dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have joined the preservationists . " What price are we willing to put on our heritage ? " asks Congressman Robert Mrazek , a New York Democrat whose office walls are lined with photographs of Civil War generals . " You ca n't hallow the sacrifice of those soldiers who died fighting for freedom with a Burger King or a Bloomingdale 's . " Mrazek and Texas Democrat Michael Andrews have introduced legislation authorizing the Federal Government to seize Stuart 's Hill from the developers , at a cost of $35 million or more . <P> While Mrazek and 200 allies on Capitol Hill hope to bring the bill to a vote next month , Annie Snyder and her supporters are sniping from the grass-roots level . " We have Save the Battlefield battalions forming across the U.S. , " she says . " Schoolchildren and veterans are writing and sending money . " A former Marine officer , Snyder , 66 , is a veteran of Manassas campaigns . In 1973 she fought to stop an amusement park planned for the same spot . For that victory , this Yankee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Daughters of the Confederacy.
