NATURE AND CULTURE by Barbara Novak ; Oxford ; 323 pages ; $35 ft <P> <P> " In the beginning all the world was America . " John Locke 's 300-year-old phrase still keeps its haunting simplicity . For generations , America meant the part of the earth that was not corrupt , not worn by labor , tainted by inequality or poisoned by greed . This myth of paradise-on-the-frontier pervaded 18th century ideas about America and , by the mid-19th , had become one of the chief regulating ideas of America 's discourse about itself : " That unfallen , western world , " as Melville wrote in Moby Dick , " which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic as a god .

" The noblest ministry of nature , " claimed Ralph Waldo Emerson , in the tone of transcendentalist piety whose echo is still heard among American environmentalists , " is to stand as the apparition of God .

Kensett did not simply arise from their formal talents as painters . They were reinforced by a social agreement about the meanings of art and landscape in the last age of faith , when there still appeared to be a seamless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this relationship was religious experience . Here , art preached while remaining whole as art ; and the result was a fervid intensity , within the image of American space , that could never quite be recaptured-despite the efforts of " transcendentalist " American abstract painters like Mark Rothko to revive it a century later .
