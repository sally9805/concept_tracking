After 11 arduous , dusty seasons of digging into a huge mound in northwest Syria , he and his team had suddenly broken through to the archives of a lost civilization that once thrived north of Palestine a thousand years before Moses. // Its name : Ebla. // Nothing like it had been found since a young Bedouin goat-herder happened upon the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1947 , bringing to light a lost library from the time of Jesus. // In its early days , the Ebla ' ' earthquake ' ' stirred up as much confusion and doubtful speculation as it did solid insight. // Only now has the smoke begun to clear . Confusion is giving way to more sober conclusions - in fact , to a whole rewriting of the history of the origins of civilization. // New books by Dr. Matthiae and the original tablet-decoder ( epigrapher ) , Giovanni Pettinato , have recently appeared in English translation . These are giving the English-speaking world its first detailed look at the Ebla findings. // Eblaite language is also being introduced as a field of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( NYU ) , next year at Harvard ' s Divinity School. // And although early claims of links to the Bible have been discarded , Ebla appears to be revolutionizing thinking about the historical and geographical backdrop of the earliest biblical events. // The story of Abraham , for one , may never look quite the same. // Before the discovery , the ancient Near East of 4 , 000 to 5 , 000 years ago appeared to be a fairly simple bipolar world . At one ' ' pole ' ' : Egypt and the dynasties of the Pharaohs along the Nile . At the other : Mesopotamian civilization , with its cities and ziggurats ( terraced pyramids ) dominating the Tigris-Euphrates River valley . The region in between the two poles , from Syria down through Palestine , seemed a cultural backwater . In Matthiae ' s terms : ' ' a blank canvas. ' ' // Now the canvas teems with forms and colors. // Ebla , and the northwestern Syrian region just north of today ' s Lebanon , turn out to have been a thriving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and distinctive language , a bilingual educational system , and a state archive that housed meticulous records of widespread trade in finished goods - from textiles to finely crafted objects in metal and wood. // Eblaite civilization reached its zenith at about 2250 BC with a population of nearly a quarter million. // Whether Ebla was an empire of far-reaching political and economic control or just a commercial outpost of Mesopotamian civilization is still under debate . But in his new book , ' ' Ebla : An Empire Rediscovered , ' ' Dr. Matthiae opts for the more spectacular view . Ebla was nothing less , he says , than ' ' the centre of the most ancient great culture of Western Asia yet to enter historical record , ' ' and ' ' one of the critical turning points in the spread of city civilization to the West. ' ' // Its buildings were concentrated in a spectacular walled city on a mound known today as Tell Mardikh . A ' ' tell ' ' is a mound that accrues as cities are built , demolished , and rebuilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the city was abandoned , wind-blown sands turned the site into a rounded hill. // Some of the buildings were monumental in scale , particularly the royal palace complex that housed the archives , temples , and government chambers . The palace walls were nearly 50 feet high. // But far more intriguing to the archaeologists has been the state archives and its some 10 , 000 tablets - the earliest major archives ever discovered. // Eblaites developed a distinctive written language that had been totally lost for over 4 , 000 years . Early after the discovery Dr. Pettinato concluded that the ' ' Eblaite ' ' language is a member of the Semitic family ( of which Hebrew and Arabic are also a part ) . Further study has proved him right , although debate rages over the significance of the Semitic link. // The tablets themselves had been stacked on wooden shelves . When the palace and archives were captured by invading armies sometime between 2150 and 2350 BC , the library was set ablaze . But the flames - which rapidly reduced the shelves to ashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thousands of specimens of Eblaite script were perfectly preserved in a soft bed of ashes. // The tablets not only revealed vastly detailed records of trade . They have also turned up names of people or cities at remote distances in Anatolia ( modern Turkey ) , eastern Mesopotamia , Cyprus , and even Egypt. // There also appear names related to those of the biblical period : Micah , Michael , and Ishmael . ' ' Ebrium , ' ' the name of a long-ruling Eblaite king , may also be a linguistic cousin of ' ' Eber , ' ' a forefather of the biblical Abraham. // The discovery of such names doesn ' t mean the Eblaites ' ' invented ' ' the names to begin with . Ebla ' s civilization never came into direct contact with the Hebrew civilization that emerged well on in 2nd millennium BC . But the Ebla findings add new evidence that these Bible name types circulated widely in the Mesopotamian region in the pre-biblical period. // Early in the game , epigrapher Pettinato even claimed to have found the names of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Sodom , Gomorrah , Zoar , Admah , and Zeboim . These cities have never been found by archaeologists . If found , they could add credence to the historical validity of the Bible ' s accounts of Abraham. // But as so often occurs with the discoveries of antiquity , the artifacts were playing tricks on the experts . Dr. Pettinato revised his claim and now says that only the first three names appear . Other experts question even that , saying that the names are indeed in the tablets , but the cities are not the biblical ones . Other scholars , like Dr. Robert Biggs of the University of Chicago , says the names are not the biblical names at all , but names for metals. // Given the deciphering difficulties and the span of centuries between the Eblaite and Hebrew civilizations , most Ebla specialists now warn strongly against pushing biblical links too far . Still , some scholars continue to see implications. // The Rev. Mitchell Dahood of the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome has argued that the Ebla texts yield clues for clearing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very existence of its sophisticated literary culture suggests that the Bible ' s early literature should be taken more seriously as historical material. // For the scholars thinking through biblical implications , the patriarch Abraham continues to attract much of the attention. // Older historical textbooks had tended to create a very misleading image of the patriarch , says Prof. Cyrus Gordon , who teaches NYU ' s new Ebla program. // Abraham is often portrayed , he says , as something of a wayward , illiterate , backward nomad drifting like a desert sheikh from southern Mesopotamia northwest through the culturally backward Syrian region and eventually southward into Palestine . However , the great wealth the Bible attributes to him , along with his contacts with royalty like Pharaoh and Abimelech , never quite squared with the textbook image. // Ebla may help to resolve the apparent contradiction . The findings indicate a great deal of freedom of movement among peoples and traders through the ancient Near East in pre-Bible times . Dr. Gordon concludes that Abraham may have been an aristocratic merchant in touch with peoples and traders from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an image that would fit quite well with his wealth and the sophistication he must have had to mix with kings and nobles. // Another centuries-old puzzle Ebla ' s archives might solve is that of Abraham ' s birthplace . The Bible ' s accounts in Genesis seem to contradict themselves by pointing to two cities . One , ' ' Ur of the Chaldees ' ' ( Gen. 11 : 28 , 31 ) has long been assumed to be the southeast Mesopotamian city by that name . Other accounts have been thought to designate the northern Syrian region and a town named Haran ( Gen. 24 : 4 , 10 ; 27 : 43 ; Joshua 24 : 2 ) . // Now Ebla ' s tablets , says Dr. Pettinato , reveal that a city named Ur existed in Syria in the area of Haran ( and Ebla ) . If true , this may show that the two cities mentioned in Genesis are actually one , and finally clear up the contradiction. // As for the general relevance of Ebla for understanding Abraham , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholars date him as early as the 3rd millennium BC ; others as late as the late 2nd millennium BC . Some doubt his historical existence altogether , but most scholars gravitate to a date around 1800 BC. // Dr. Matthiae has been trying hard to discourage all speculation about biblical links. // ' ' It has been said , ' ' he writes , ' ' that in the texts of the State Archives of . . . Ebla there is proof of the historical accuracy of the Bible patriarchs , news of a cult of Yahwe(h) at Ebla , a mention of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah . . . , and a literary text with the story of the Flood . These are tales without foundation. ' ' // That plea goes to the heart of Dr. Matthiae ' s sharp differences with epigrapher Pettinato , differences that got Pettinato into political hot water with Syrian authorities and eventually removed from the Ebla excavations altogether. // Matthiae has been adamant in placing Ebla in the context of civilizations east of Ebla . Pettinato , on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the southwest in Canaan-Palestine and their languages . That view made the Syrian authorities uneasy , fearing that the discovery would get too closely associated with the modern state of Israel and its biblical heritage . Third and last part of story is in SEBLA2. // The politicization has been a great disappointment to many scholars . ' ' Ebla has no real modern political significance at all , ' ' says Prof. David N. Freedom of the University of Michigan . Other says that even if Ebla were shown definitively to shed light on the biblical Abraham , such a finding could be acclaimed not only by the Judaeo-Christian world , but also by Muslims , since the Koran finds its own spiritual roots in the patriarch. // Another set of doubts enshrouds texts once thought to prove the astonishingly far-reaching economic dealings of Ebla . On the one hand , Ebla appears to have traded with places like Kish to the east on the Tigris River , Cyprus to the west , and Anatolia to the northwest . Early on , Dr. Pettinato had discerned mention of a treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far to the east on the Tigris River . But some analysts now think that this ' ' Ashur ' ' and other ' ' remote ' ' cities actually refer to towns much closer to Ebla , says Professor Biggs. // The perplexing changeability in conclusions being drawn about the Ebla tablets stems largely from the tantalizing , chameleon-like nature of Eblaite language itself. // Eblaites combined elements of their own Semitic speech and grammar with the cuneiform script invented by the Sumerian civilization , a society that dominated much of Mesopotamia for the first half of the 3rd millennium BC. // Cuneiform conveys its messages by configurations of wedgelike shapes punched into wet clay . Sumerian wedge-pictures - ' ' logograms ' ' - are so prominent in Eblaite writing that Ebla ' s scribes had to be trained in the ' ' classical Sumerian ' ' to be able to write their own language . Bilingual dictionaries have been found that list Eblaite equivalents next to Sumerian words. // ' ' You might say that what Latin and Greek are to us , - Sumerian was to the Eblaites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of linguistic elements in Eblaite are so unusual that the decoders have been tantalized by their task. // Sumerian logograms are intermingled with the grammar and word forms of Ebla ' s spoken Semitic speech . Certain words are abbreviated using Sumerian logograms , but obviously stand for totally different Eblaite words . A parallel in English would be the abbreviation of the Latin word ' ' libra . ' ' We see ' ' lb. , ' ' but we say ' ' pound. ' ' // To compound the decoding difficulties , the same sign can sometimes represent more than one sound . One sign , for instance , can be used in the Ebla texts for the sounds g , k , and q ; another for d , th , and t ; and another for fourtypes of ' ' s ' ' sounds. // As a result , various analysts can look at the same configurations of wedges and see very different things. // Nevertheless , the scholars have found keys for breaking the Eblaite code with remarkable facility : Sumerian texts already known from Mesopotamia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that Eblaite grammar is Semitic , a grammar that had already been studied. // For all the progress to date , new - and sometimes fantastic - theories about the abundant Ebla data continue to pour forth. // Professor Gordon is toying with the idea that Eblaite may have been a kind of lingua franca , a common language of trade and commerce . This could explain , he theorizes , why Genesis 10 refers to a time when all the peoples of the earth spoke a common language. // One of the latest speculations of Professor Matthiae surrounds the name ' ' Ebla ' ' itself . The origin of the term , he says , is hard to pin down precisely and can be variously interpreted . But it likely referred to ' ' a site of rock emerging from a natural limestone hillock and gleaming white in the sun . ' ' At Tell Mardiek , he says , such a rock slab rises under the ruins toward the city ' s acropolis. // Professor Matthiae also speculates that Ebla originated a crucial concept of universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Ebla , he writes , appears to have conceived of the world in a quadripartite - four-part - way . Possibly to symbolize this , and Ebla ' s central place in it , the city was divided into four quarters . These were arranged something like the quadrants of a circle , with the city ' s acropolis at the center . Ebla ' s kings , he concludes , may have used the quadripartite concept as a metaphor for speaking about their rule over ' ' the whole world. ' ' // More time is needed before all speculation is more fully sorted out from fact ; only a fraction of all Ebla ' s tablets have been fully studied. // But without a doubt the Ebla findings have already given the pre-biblical period a totally new face. // ' ' If you look at the textbooks published several decades ago , ' ' reflects Professor Gordon , ' ' you get the impression that the early Bronze Age was prehistory . Even Abraham of later centuries and his religion were portrayed in this primitive light. // ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities like Ebla with students being trained in classics ( Sumerian ) , being put through their paces in bilingual education , and thousands of tablets in a single archives - this isn ' t prehistory . We see that even well before Abraham , there had been a long history of intellectual development and international exchange of a highly sophisticated kind. ' ' // //
