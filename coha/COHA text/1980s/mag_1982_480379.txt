AT THE CREST of the hill , the maples opened up suddenly on the right , and I got one quick look at a column of smoke tumbling into the sky . It was fat and dirty yellow and climbing high fast . The road curved , dipped , and my Toyota whipped down into the valley . I was zippered up again in the August woodlots of north-central Vermont . My chin grazed the top of the steering wheel as I strained to see above the maples , but I could n't detect even a smudge mark through rents in the foliage . We do n't often see that mean kind of smoke against Vermont sky . A town dump ( they call it a sanitary landfill now ) might be burning off old lumber , but I thought not . Then the road turned again , descended toward an open valley , and on the left was a long red barn spewing smoke from the far end . The farmhouse , attached to the side of the barn at the opposite end , faced the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men , a woman or two , some children ? . stood beside the barn , apart from each other , looking at flamelets flickering in the smoke , looking at each other , looking off across the road at nothing in particular . They did n't shout . They stood quietly , or walked deliberately on the tan dust of the barnyard . I guessed that no humans were trapped inside , that the cows were out to pasture , as they should be on this sunny morning , and that the fire department had been called . As I passed by slowly , a young man drove a blue tractor up to the edge of the field he had been haying and leaped off . He ran across my rear-view mirror to the barnyard . I pulled up on a strip of lawn beside a neorustic Iog fence , switched off the engine , and looked at the barn a few hundred feet back . No one came around the corner of the farmhouse to watch the road from Floyd C. Stuart is a poet and essayist who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone on a lovely , quiet morning . Smoke , thicker and blacker by the second , rode up the calm air . The barn crackled quickly and softly . The mountains humped along the rim of the sky at a middling distance , enclosing not a flat valley but meadows and woodlots that follow ups and downs of debris that the last glacier dumped . The land is fertile ; it does n't tip quite so many tractors onto farmers as harsher terrain elsewhere in the state ; the people are industrious . Some are poor ; some are very , very rich . It was the third week in August , when mornings have a winter snap . I had rolled up the windows as I drove out of the yard at nine to pick up my son and his friend returning from a canoe trip . My winter wood was in ; last night I had split kindling until dark , dripping sweat in the chill air . We were into the season when we size up haylofts and woodpiles against the next eight months . Summer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Toward the end of August , we feel a heightened sense of urgency in our lives , or self-satisfied relief . Winter , though not really our enemy , is a force we do not long forget . Contending with it , a man defines a large part of his life . But it was not winter yet , and the day was working toward the eighty or eightyfive degrees the radio promised , which is more heat ? than we care for in Vermont . I rolled the windows down , inviting a cross-breeze . T HE SMOKE at the rear of the barn rose several hundred feet up , blotting out the sun or letting it shine the size and color of a penny . Dirty white smoke , like raw sheep 's wool and the same lumpy texture , twisted from under shingles along the entire ridgeline , Solid flame spurted out 55 the hayloft door and curved up into morning . It spat black bits of debris that fluttered end over end in firewind . I heard very crisply now the fire eating . A cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Across the road , a herd of eighteen Holsteins and a couple of Jerseys had gathered at the two strands of wire separating the pasture and a house lot chopped out of it . The herd stared with massive intensity across a perfect lawn and a modern ranch-style home to the line of maples that began behind the L of the $ farmhouse and brushed their barn . I had been wrong : some cows were still in the stalls . I heard only one more time that bleat of desolation . This was no equivocal fire now but black smoke muscling slabs of orange flame that sucked and whooshed in greedy respiration . The cows in the pasture quivered with anxiety , sensing that something catastrophic was undermining everything familiar . They seemed on the verge of stampeding to the barn . The cows and I on this side of the barn , the half dozen people I could not see on the other side ? we stared at an event towering above our daily lives . The first siren yelped up the long hill from Morrisville . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had parked in front of an old farmhouse converted to elegance , a common example of Vermont continuous architecture . The squarish story-and-ahalf main structure rambled into a one-story summer kitchen that drifted into a woodshed , all lined up in front of the road . The old farmers liked things to connect so they could stay out of the blizzard . This house had all good clapboards , and they gleamed fresh white . Three large picture windows had been cut into the walls , and the summer kitchen and woodshed were remodeled to airy rooms . A Cadillac sat in the driveway , and beside that a large station wagon . The house was much like the one where the barn was burning , except it had fine black shingles instead of a corrugated metal roof bleeding rust . A thin blond woman in her late forties hurried down the driveway and stood by my car . She wore a white blouse and slacks , white socks , and opentoed sandals . Her fingernails resting on her crossed arms glinted oxblood in the sun . She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eye , I had seen silhouettes move behind one picture window as if figures were coming in through the back door . A husky man and several husky teenagers streamed out ? a front door , and broke into a lope up the hill . They all wore shorts , sport shirts , socks , and sneakers as white as their house . They made a fine sight jogging toward the black smoke of the barn . The woman said this was their summer house . They were from Montreal . Quebecois have bought a lot of northern Vermont , and our stop signs often read " Arrete , " but this woman had no French accent . I have lived a little beyond northern New England ? Cleveland , Brooklyn , the Bronx ? and although her accent was none of these , I recognized a rhythm , a tonal pattern , that struck me as worldwide urban ; it had the universal tinge of hardness and assertiveness that helps one survive among millions of people who live in buildings that stand up like tombstones . The woman said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country peace before returning to Montreal , and now this had to happen . She told me they let the farmer whose barn was burning hay their field to keep it open . I gathered that he might be someone 's tenant farmer , a common arrangement in Vermont , where often the land is owned by a hardto-identify European or South American syndicate . The woman was sure a plane had crashed . I said I suspected not , and told her about spontaneous combustion . The farmer had most of his hay in : every open barn door I saw was blocked with bales . " But , " the lady said , " I heard an engine over there . " She pointed to the field where the young man had leaped off his tractor . " It sounded very low . " I did not try to pry her from her plane crash . She was used to clanging pistons , butane candles , exploding storage tanks ; in our country , we fear clouds or stalks of grass that strike like matches while we work or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me on the street has not one thing from his childhood : his whole family history before his teens burned to ashes with the farm . My neighbor across the street to the east saw a lightning bolt strike his barn . His rented farm , everything he owned , turned to cinders in 1929 . The lady was very nice . She told me twice I was perfectly welcome to leave my car at her place if I wanted to walk back to the fire . The first Morrisville engine roared by , and a few private cars going fast . The volunteers were arriving , parking out of the way in yards and fields . A cop car sped by and a minute later raced back , its wind buffeting my face . Down the hill , at a crossroads beyond our sight , I knew he would set up a roadblock . The tall column of smoke rose straight up , and spread an acrid gray-blue haze above the valley . The lady sniffed the air and said it was awful , awful , referring partly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her windows , but again welcomed me to park there . T HE ROADBLOCK was up , because a straggling line of people were hiking up the hill . Farm families in work-worn jeans , kids with soda cans , vacationers in expensive casual slacks and monogrammed shirts . A big-boned , pot-bellied man with a tiny wife stopped and took pictures . The camera clicked and whirred ? smooth , assured . professional . But the white-clad people from the summer house headed home against the current . A solitary and inexplicable man in his mid-twenties , with black beard and black briefcase , walked briskly by . He looked like an insurance adjuster called in to work suddenly on Saturday morning , impatient for this 56 disaster to get done with so he could make his estimate and finish mowing the lawn . Equipment began rolling in : ladder truck , pumper , yellow jeep with sexy roll bars . The ambulance , a white box with an orange slash , pulled into the yard of the farmhouse across from the fire . Men and women in orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few of the crew seemed to be teenagers and reminded me of the son I was going to retrieve , for I had bought him the same kind of suit last year when he started to train with our town 's ambulance volunteers . You could see the crew 's quiet excitement : they did not want misfortune to strike , but they were glad to be invited when it did , and to do for real what they had practiced . Water is always a problem at a country fire . Right off I had looked for the farm pond , but could n't find it . As soon as the first truck arrived , I saw men run like hell along a ridge into a pasture . The open land diminished them ; their legs scissored too fast for the distance they covered . The yellow jeep jolted out . The low ridge was the pond rim . Maybe they got a pump going , or maybe they hooked up to a tanker , I could n't tell , but soon a hose kicked and ejected a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I heard axes hacking ; stifled somewhere in the smokecotton , men were ventilating the roof . They wanted to get rid of heat and fumes so they could work . If the barn burned straight up , they might stop the fire from eating the connecting house . Morrisville , Hyde Park , Johnson , Stowe ? the towns rolled their units in . Radios crackled as dispatchers jockeyed this truck and that . A few engines were rectangular like blocks of Cabot cheese and painted lemon yellow . They had the latest yippyyappy sirens . But in this small state of small towns , most communities make do . It was largely lean red trucks with bulky fenders and old-style sirens wailing up from Morrisville . One tanker , full , took the hill at ten miles an hour , backfiring as if it would explode . The firemen were unperturbed . The ripe orange flames finally began to shrink after the barn was ventilated , and the smoke roiled up more efficiently . One cow down in the pasture broke for the barn and lumbered onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue-jeaned man dashed at her from the road . She wheeled around , reluctant , turning her heft against him again and again . Another man ran onto the lawn to help . A startling aspect of fire is suddenly running figures . So much work is done slowly , methodically ; men crouch at hoses ; they pick and pick at clapboards with a gaff ; they sit down and saw , or eye a bank of gauges . Then something gets out of hand . Men run , dribbling flat gray hose . They sprint across the lawn for cows . The Holstein revolved her wall of meat against the men , but they hollered and feinted her to the lawn 's edge . They yanked up two fence stakes and drove her over the wires back to the pasture . For the moment , they had won . A T LEAST four tank trucks kept grinding back and forth from town . The electric company sent out a truck with a hydraulic boom , and a lineman cut off current to the house . Then a red pickup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to someone else 's farm . The pickup banged off the road , over the ditch , and stopped short in a sizzle of spinning tires : the tail of the van had caught on the banking . Farm kids dropped off the side of the van almost before the tires began to spin , and one ran to the blue tractor across the road . He nosed the machine into the field and gunned it toward the pickup , but everyone was shouting " No , no , " and the driver saw their meaning . He jounced onto the road again , slipped the lip of the tractor 's bucket loader under the van , and lifted . The pickup raced off , and the van clattered across the pasture like a bag of empty cans . These are the scenes of help we call heartwarming ; they did not quite camouflage the anguish of that surprising morning . The men fought time and their own equipment . The fire burned steadily toward the road end of the barn . And yet things were really going quite well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house and barn roofs joined . A fireman had cut one vent hole in the house roof , and now he crouched on a ladder hooked further along the ridgepole , ready to cut another . He braced his boots against the rungs , held the power saw in one hand , and yanked the starter cord with the other . Nothing happened . Smoke billowed out the first vent , hid him , then cleared . The line of flame where the roofs joined was pert and healthy . The man made an adjustment , pulled again , and the blade ? round like a pizza cutter , but edged with wicked teeth ? blurred . It stopped . Patiently , the man leaned into the awkward ladder , tuning , fiddling , coaxing the damn little cylinder into spitting alive . At last the blade whined silver and sank into the corrugated metal . The men fought their own bodies . The ambulance had its first customer right after they vented the barn . A middle-aged man sat on the driveway , legs straight out in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had pulled off his helmet and heavy coat , and stuck oxygen on his nose . He sat in T-shirt and enormous boots , breathing in , breathing out . His belly nudged over his belt . He seemed as calm as those half dozen people who twenty minutes earlier had waited for him to come . The crew decided this one should go to the hospital , and the ambulance sailed off , siren walloping , red lights erupting on all four sides . They left attendants beside a second man , who began sipping oxygen . Trucks were parked everywhere off the fire lane . Doors hung open on empty equipment cabinets . Radios relayed terse messages : send air packs , send tankers . A ladder truck had arrived , and they raised the ladder to the loft door on the road end of the barn . The door was nearly blocked with bales of hay . A fireman perched on the end of the ladder and held a hose to the opening . On both sides of him and below him the wail suddenly jetted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red clapboards . Smoke like a train raging out of a tunnel charged from the loft door , and the damn fool stayed put ? spraying . You could see only his boot soles unmoving on the rungs . Then the whole upper barn wall puffed a solid flank of smoke , and the man was gone . None of the men below seemed to notice much . I saw him dimly in the smoke again ; he had backed off about a foot . Then flame lunged out the entire area of the loft door with the force of a blowtorch , completely enveloping the man . He mounted again the one step to the very tip of the ladder and sprayed and sprayed and sprayed for the full hour I watched the fire . The front doors of Vermont farmhouses have never been much used , and these days many ? like the front door of this house ? are covered by plastic sheets fastened with nail and lathe . The big-windowed door , framed on three sides by rows of little windows , wastes heat . Fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty cords of wood to feed his draughty furnace through a winter , but today we are more niggardly and try to get by on five or six cords burned in airtight furnaces in an insulated house . Someone opened the front door and slashed away last winter 's plastic . Men began carrying the insides of the house out , piling everything a few yards away at the foot of a large shade tree beside the road . Chairs , tables , bed frames , mattresses mounted into the lower branches . The family had to lay out for everyone to see the stained , worn , ripped intimacies of their daily living . Two men struggled with a boxy avocado refrigerator , tipping it so that leftovers and half-full bottles spilled in a trail over the grass . Firemen set up two metal frames in the road . The frames supported canvas , and into these pools tank trucks poured water frothy with fire-retarding chemicals . Two more hoses began to spurt . I stood in the yard of the house across the road , next to several cords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , softening the road tar ; heat waves shimmered from the barn ; when a fireman came over for oxygen and flung off his heavy coat , sweat rolled down his naked chest in sheets . The forecast said it might go down into the thirties tonight . I stood beside the woodpile , watching tons of hay burn , wiping sweat from my forehead , cam , prehending like a cow the economy of the world 's giving out and grabbing back . I WATCHED the fire for an hour before leaving to meet my son and his friend . Tank trucks and the ambulance were still racing back and forth from Morrisville . The fire burned pretty much as it always had . An hour or so later , when I descended into the valley from the north , the two boys were tired and quiet in the backseat . Miles off , a 57 broad pillar of smoke rose from the rolling fields as if to lead us home . We could not get through the roadblock beyond Morrisville , but a state cop said the dirt road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barn . I pulled over on a rise of the dirt road . The barn had collapsed along its whole length . From a black heap black timbers jutted like broken bones . Smoke still rose as from a bombed city . A flatbed rig hauling a bulldozer crawled up the hill . They were going to rake over the burning rubble . The line of maples , not having caught fire and having no red barn to stand before , were outlined branch by branch in midday light . Two chimneys still stood along a roof-line . It seemed as if the firemen might save the house . The fire was no big deal . Only cows were killed . Later I would learn spontaneous combustion burned down two barns in Vermont that day ; together they earned a couple of inches inside the Sunday paper . Over toward Stowe , a tow plane tugged a slim-winged glider toward the thermals , where it could swoop and climb in spirals among upwelling shafts of heated air . Before tomorrow , a new wind would sweep the valley clear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from under the shade tree . They would nail temporary plastic over the vent holes in the roof , and smell smoke for years . When the fire was at its height , I happened to be near the petite lady , who was talking to her husband , His camera rested on his belly , the black lens protruding like a navel . She was in trim blue slacks , her glass frames winked with bits of jewel , and she perched like a sparrow on tiny side-by-side feet . She said they should let the whole thing go . It was no use . And men might get hurt . Earlier I had watched a fireman in his fifties breathe oxygen a while , then shrug on his rubber coat and trudge back to the barn . Now , as the petite lady spoke , he crossed the road again , supported by the arms of friends but still walking on his own saggy legs . They stripped off his coat , and young people on the ambulance crew hitched him up to oxygen . The fireman , wobbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily like Jacob when his hip gave out . The man had gone into the smoke-filled barn until his chest seized up . He did not have to drag trapped people out from the roiling dark . Maybe he wanted to save a barn because it was impossible , because it is never too late . Maybe he was half thinking of the queer relationship between the spirit and its things . We are comforted by the hum of an avocado refrigerator and by the years ' accommodation a mattress has made to our lovemaking and sleeping bones . These , too , must be saved . Sitting on the grass by the ambulance , the fireman looked terribly ill and peaceful . He breathed in . He breathed out . The petite lady looked across the road . He breathed in . His respiration isolated , moment by moment , each thing as it really mattered . It was a gift of order to a morning gone awry .
