Donald Sheelen , former chairman of troubled Regina Co. , thought of himself as a David whose Goliath was Hoover Co. and whose arsenal was a set of clever marketing tools . Through heavy television advertising , fast-paced product introductions , low prices and generous rebates , 42-year-old Mr. Sheelen did indeed shake up the sleepy vacuum cleaner industry and draw notice from investors and competitors . But in his dash to be No. 1 , Mr. Sheelen poured too much into marketing and too little into quality , analysts say . " He was vehement about Regina and its potential market share increases , " says Richard Stallone at Shearson Lehman Hutton . " Especially against Hoover . He said he was going to put Hoover out of business . " One of Mr. Sheelen ' s favorite tricks was to pit his machines against Hoover ' s . He rarely attended an analysts ' meeting without sprinkling corn flakes on the carpet and doing an impromptu comparative demonstration . Despite industry tests that proved Hoover superior , the Regina machine always won , picking up flakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stallone : " Let ' s put it this way : He did a little sleight of hand . " Mr. Sheelen , at his Rumson , N.J. , home , declined to comment for this story . Showmanship aside , quality problems plagued the Rahway , N.J. , company since its debut in upright vacuum cleaners two years ago . Retailers say return rates on some products have been greater than 20% . Regina ' s two most recent introductions had to be withdrawn . Earlier this month , things began to fall apart . The company had a surprise bad quarter and then withdrew its fiscal 1988 report . The company ' s stock  --  40% of it Mr. Sheelen ' s  --  took a battering , and Mr. Sheelen abruptly quit his job , hired a lawyer , and disappeared from public view . The U.S. attorney in Newark , N.J. , and the Securities and Exchange Commission have launched investigations . Mr. Sheelen graduated as president of his class from the University of Dayton in 1968 , with a marketing degree . He received an M.B.A. from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson &; Johnson medical equipment unit , Jelco Inc . In 1980 , he went to General Signal Corp. ' s Regina , becoming president by 1983 . People there at the time say he grew restless with the slow pace of product introductions . In 1984 , he took Regina private and brought it public again in 1985 . His strategy was to spend money making the Regina name famous , analysts say . Regina last year spent $40 million on advertising  --  over 20% of revenue , and more than Hoover and Eureka Co. combined , analysts say . Regina ' s commercials were brash . When Mr. Sheelen brought his corn flakes game to television , Hoover sued , and a federal judge called the commercials a " theatrical production " that was " most disturbing . " Regina pulled the commercial . " He was in a market where no one else was a good marketer , " says Seth Feinstein , an analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann &; Co . " Don would say , ' Hey , we ' ll come out with some innovations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really eat them up . ' " In two years , Regina ' s upright cleaners shot from nothing to an 11% market share , compared with Hoover ' s 32% . Industry giants , who ' d barely advertised before , pumped up their own ad budgets . Mr. Sheelen also knew what consumers wanted . One of his new products after the buy-out was a HomeSpa  --  a poor man ' s Jacuzzi . For under $100 , consumers could turn bathtubs into whirlpools with what were essentially vacuum cleaner motors . And he devised a method of attaching a hose to upright cleaners , which people could pull out to vacuum drapes or the ceiling  --  for under $100 . Competitor ' s uprights had to be turned upside down and have separate pieces attached to do the same thing . While the industry shunned rebates , Regina used them heavily . But the emphasis on marketing at the expense of manufacturing and quality control caused trouble . Quality problems alarmed both retailers and analysts . " We confronted him about the beater bars falling off , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ' s true , how come the revenues are so high ? " says Mr. Stallone . " What we ' ll never know is , what would have happened if he had good quality along with the good ideas ? " says Ted DuPont , a former editor at Home Furnishings Daily , a trade publication . " If he ' d just spent a little more on the execution , and less time on the goal of ' getting Hoover , ' he might still be here .
