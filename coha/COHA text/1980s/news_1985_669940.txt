KUWAIT MAY REVERSE its policy of rescuing financial companies that are in difficulty , according to bankers in London and the Persian Gulf . Many Kuwaiti companies still are tottering from the effects of the country ' s 1982 stock market crash , involving tens of billions of dollars in losses . Some of these companies could collapse without government support , resulting in extensive losses to international creditor banks . In what is regarded as a test case , Kuwait ' s National Assembly is pressuring the new finance minister and the central bank governor to halt government support for an ailing foreign-exchange , bullion and real-estate trading company , Jawad &; Hadar Y. Abulhasan , Kuwaiti sources say . Abulhasan is one of the country ' s biggest money-changing companies and it operates as a quasi-bank .

" Reciprocity " has become a buzzword in the board rooms of major German banks in response to central bank pressure to end a six-bank cartel on mark-denominated Eurobonds . Such a change would mean that other banks , including West German subsidiaries of foreign banks , could share in this Euromark bond business . To compensate , West German banks are adding their weight to world-wide demands for deregulation of foreign financial centers , such as Tokyo . Some observers , meanwhile , think this " deregulation fever " could feed back into the West German financial sector , presenting the central bank with growing demands from within the sector to dismantle longstanding regulations . Central bank officials say their decision to push for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desire to strengthen Frankfurt as an international financial center . But West German bankers suspect that lobbying by Japanese and U.S. banks and monetary authorities also played a role . For the moment , the main concern among bankers in Frankfurt is that Japanese banks not gain a share of the West German wholesale banking market without German banks receiving equal access to business in Tokyo . However , West German bankers worry that the structure of the Japanese market , where banks form part of large business conglomerates , will keep the Germans out of lucrative wholesale business in Tokyo even if they are given greater rights there . They also are concerned that Japanese banks have gained a strong foothold in Switzerland without apparently extending the same opportunities to Swiss banks in Japan.  --  - SINGAPORE BANKS ARE SUFFERING from the local economic slump , troublesome loan portfolios and shrinking market share amid heightened competition . Singapore ' s four largest banks , dependent on a property market that has steadily declined in the past eight months , reported poor financial results for 1984 . Analysts don ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst may be over for major local banks , which have set aside allowances for nonperforming loans backed by overvalued properties . Likewise , the more than 200 other banks , merchant-banking operations and finance companies are braced for a tough spell . Some banks have reduced staff , switched some operations to other Asian cities and narrowed their activities . Samuel Montagu &; Co. , a London-based investment bank , for example , recently closed its gold and foreign-exchange trading departments in Singapore , slashing local staff by half . Hongkong &; Shanghai Banking Corp. is setting up in Singapore what it calls an " intensive care unit " to help its customers .

The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion payment to trade creditors in July and August , the sources say . The central bank is said to have sent a letter about the June payments to all the country ' s 15 , 000 creditors who were becoming agitated by the long delay since the last issue of notes in February . The central bank has blamed the delays in new issues on technical problems arising from the reconciliation of creditor claims.  --  - SOUTH KOREA HAS REMOVED some restrictions on foreign banks operating there , but bankers say they aren ' t sure they ' re any better off . In theory , South Korea ' s policy allows foreign banks to expand their lending in local currency . But complex regulations ultimately may make that possible only for the larger institutions , such as Citibank , Bank of America and Chase Manhattan . Moreover , equal treatment also means having to abide by some of the unpopular regulations that formerly covered only domestic banks . For example , foreign banks now must lend a certain percentage to small and medium-sized companies , a requirement few banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know why the foreign bankers have been demanding equal treatment , " says a European banker . " Equal treatment is rubbish . It comes with too many strings. "  --  - THE PHILIPPINE VETERANS BANK was placed under receivership by the government .

The bank was set up 21 years ago with funds belonging to 480 , 000 Filipino veterans from World War II.
