When Misha Rachlevsky was ten years old , he and his violin were escorted by dark-suited security agents into an ornate Moscow hall where he was told to play a solo in a concert . <P> It was his first real performance . To this day , Rachlevsky has no idea of who was in the audience . " Unfortunately , I do n't know whom it was for , " says Rachlevsky , now 41 . " My father was in the back where the security guards were . He could see me , but he was prevented from seeing who the people were down there . " <P> That concert was several continents back . Since then , Rachlevsky has lived in Israel , Canada and the U.S. , but in some ways the violinist , now bearded and barrel-chested , is still squinting into the audience to discern the identity of his benefactors . Lately , it seems , they are as elusive as his long-ago Moscow audience . <P> On Saturday , April 9 , Rachlevsky led the New American Chamber Orchestra as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chamber group as a part-time orchestra in 1978 after stints with the Moscow and Israel chamber orchestras . For Misha Rachlevsky the violinist ( even while he was a violinist for the Detroit Symphony ) , creating his own chamber orchestra was a chance to become Misha Rachlevsky the impresario . <P> It is a role to which he adapted almost instantly . " As you can see , " he says as he pores over one of his orchestra 's advertisements , " I have become quite the capitalist . " <P> The orchestra became Rachlevsky 's consuming passion . He gave up his job at the Detroit Symphony in 1984 to create a full-time chamber-music society . And he spent 20-hour days dunning corporate chiefs for money , cooking borsch for winter concertgoers , and arranging for a towing service to be on call for orchestra patrons whose cars failed to start on concert evenings . <P> " Rachlevsky has put his heart and soul and lifeblood in this to make it go , " says Madeleine Phillips of Grosse Pointe Farms , who has attended the concerts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manager of the outfit , the principal violinist . He did it all  --  legwork to advertising . He almost cloned himself . " <P> " Misha would work right alongside us , " recalls Carole Fuller , a procurement clerk-typist for the Army who late in life discovered a passion for chamber music and became a volunteer for the orchestra . " We 'd work until 2 or 3 or 4 in the morning sending out tickets . Sometimes Misha got so tired he 'd fall asleep with his head on a desk . " <P> But it was not enough . In a city where the symphony is struggling to keep its head above water , the odds against a smaller group were evidently just too long . Although the ensemble plays more than 100 concerts a year and tours Europe annually , it needs help to meet the annual tab of about $500,000 for keeping its eleven musicians playing . <P> " We have never had an angel , " Rachlevsky says , sitting in an office above Orchestra Hall and looking for all the world like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my shoulders . " <P> " In Detroit , " he adds , " all the corporate money is basically controlled by a small group of people . I do have a certain bitterness that we were not supported in Detroit with enough money to allow us to become part of the community . "
