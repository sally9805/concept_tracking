His billowy black hair , olive skin and dark eyes proclaim the Mexican blood that came north with his grandparents . His American-born mother and father , fluent in Spanish and English , consider themselves Mexican Americans . John David , who speaks only English , is not quite sure what he is . " I do n't know , " he says , " I guess I 'm a Tex Mex . If my mom brings over a bunch of friends who talk Spanish , I would shake hands and try to say hi . That is all I probably could say to them . I guess I would just call myself an American . " <P> John David has sought his identity through sports . He has a blessed combination of quick reflexes , good speed and a lean , trim build .

" <P> John David is young enough to believe still in the potential of childhood dreams . But he has seen dreams fail . He has two older brothers , Abelardo , 23 , and Xavier , 19 , who during adolescence lost their way . " They had a chance , and they did n't do it , " says John David .

" I do n't want to have a family like my brother has now , at an early age , " John David says . " Not that soon . "
