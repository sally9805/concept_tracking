Yourcenar 's academic victory <P> " This uncertain , floating me ... is surrounded , accompanied by an invisible troupe of women who perhaps should have received this honor long before ... " <P> The honor was admission to the Academic Franaise , a group of 40 " Immortals , " guardians of the French language who are replaced when death cancels their title . The speaker was Author Marguerite Yourcenar , 77 , the only female elected to the academy in its 346 years . The members ' choice seemed perverse - they had previously spurned such women as Mme. de Stal , George Sand and Colette . Moreover , Yourcenar is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has dual citizenship , and has spent the past 40 years as a resident of New England . <P> Accordingly , when Journalist Jean d'Ormesson , 55 , lobbied in behalf of her membership , he was characterized as a " young thug " and " leftist " by outraged fellow members . Philosopher Jean Guitton , 79 , argued that admitting a woman would be " like putting a pigeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in last month , fur did not fly , nor were feathers ruffled . <P> Not that it mattered to Yourcenar . She never sought the honor , and she is unlikely to be seen within 3,000 miles of the academy . Her psychological home seems even more remote . From birth , the author was separated not only from the common reader but from ordinary life . Her Belgian mother died a week after the child was born , and Marguerite spent her formative years traveling with Papa Michel de Crayencour , a wealthy and erudite gentleman of leisure . Instructed at home , the prodigy was reading Racine and Aristophanes by the age of eight . When the girl was 16 , her papa privately published her first work of verse , and the two devised Marguerite 's almost anagrammatic nom de plume . Reviewing her own debut , Yourcenar admits , " A young musician plays scales in his room and only bores his family . A beginning writer , on the other hand , sometimes has the misfortune of getting into print . " <P> Yourcenar 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving her alone but financially independent . She had published four novels when World War II decimated her patrimony ; at the suggestion of Translator Grace Prick , she left for America . There she became an instructor in comparative literature at Sarah Lawrence College , translating in her spare time-Greek poetry and Negro spirituals for pleasure , Henry James and Virginia Woolf for pay . During the war she continued research on her historical masterwork , Memoirs of Hadrian . She was " astounded by the generosity of American universities . They lend you books and let you take them home , which is something the Bibliothque Nationale in Paris never lets you do . So of course I decided to stay . "
