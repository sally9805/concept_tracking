As soon as he landed , he was put into the Kaitak refugee camp , a warren of corrugated metal huts and worn concrete barracks where families sleep in narrow , triple-tiered bunks . It was better , decided Mr. Tang , an ethnic Chinese , than what he had before. // Four years later , however , he is still there . He could have emigrated to England with his wife and a son , but he held out for the United States and hoped another son could somehow leave Vietnam and join him. // So , at the age of 68 , he waits . He is prepared to wait a long time . " It is out of my control , " he says . " I can ' t worry about it . " Hong Kong , however , is tired of the waiting . The favorite landing spot for years of the so-called boat people from Vietnam , it has pulled down the welcome sign and made plain it does not want to take in any more . <> <> Closed Camps for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam have been placed in closed camps run by the colony ' s prison authorities . The main one , once a park with tennis courts , is on Lan Tao Island , from which escape is difficult. // The population there is now over 3 , 000 and officials are planning to build more camps . Life is regimented , with daily head counts and lineups for meals . Programs are limited , and no one may leave . This is a major departure from so-called open camps , such as Kaitak , which is administered by the Red Cross and where refugees head for work during the day , usually at low-paying factory jobs. // " We will take them in , but Hong Kong is running out of space , if you like , " said Clinton E. Leeks , a Government security official in charge of refugee operations . " We needed to make clear that they are our uninvited guests , and to get word back to Vietnam that would discourage other boat people from coming here. " // So far the policy of " humane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its effect . The number of refugees arriving in the first three months of 1983 was 297 , compared with 1 , 474 for the comparable period last year . The decline in April , however , has not been nearly as dramatic , and boat traffic normally increases from this time of the year into summer because of favorable seasonal winds. <> <> 68 , 000 Refugees in Peak Year // In the peak year , 1979 , more than 68 , 000 refugees fleeing Vietnam by boat passed through here . Since then the annual figures have dropped to between 7 , 000 and 8 , 500 , as getting out of Vietnam has grown harder. // What troubles residents of this densely packed territory is that they have never seen Hong Kong as anything but a way station for the Vietnamese , much as Vienna has been a point of passage for emigrating Soviet Jews. // But Western countries have imposed strict quotas and requirements , and so fewer and fewer Vietnamese are leaving here . The United States accepted 12 , 219 refugees from Hong Kong camps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 330 last year , and so far in 1983 it is only 339. // As a result , people like Mr. Tang , an ethnic Chinese who was a street hawker in Haiphong , wait ever longer for a chance that may never come . Of the 12 , 500 refugees in three major camps , one-fourth have been here four years and 60 percent more than two years. // Hong Kong officials concluded that they had been left holding the bag and had to do something themselves to shut off the refugee flow . <> <> ' Hong Kong Will Never Shoot ' // " With them , it ' s a question of knowing Hong Kong will never shoot at them and will never tow them out to sea , unlike other countries in the region , " Mr. Leeks said . " But , frankly , people have lost patience. " // The tough policy has caused some uneasiness . This has long been a haven for refugees , mostly from China , and a few people worry that earlier arrivals , having climbed the ladder , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t like the idea of locking these people up as if they had committed some sort of crime , " said John McPherson , a Salvation Army captain and one of the few outsiders permitted to enter the closed Lan Tao Island camp . <> <> ' We Make Our Points in Private ' // Members of the Hong Kong Christian Council have also expressed displeasure . But even those who are unhappy quickly add that they are not sure the Government had an alternative , in view of Hong Kong ' s overcrowding . Typically , there have been no formal statements of condemnation . " We make our points in private , " the Salvation Army officer said. // There are also many Cantonese here who think the authorities are too lenient , especially since illegal immigrants from China are arrested and sent back at a rate of 1 , 000 or more a month . Why help the Vietnamese , the argument goes , when Hong Kong is not prepared to take care of fellow Chinese ? // Among the questions with no immediate answer is how long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although they seem to have enough to eat and do not lack for medical care , boredom runs high , as do tensions on occasion. // Serious brawling broke out between rival factions at Kaitak last May . It led to the sending of 2 , 800 Vietnamese , most of them from the south , to another camp to separate them from 5 , 400 northern Vietnamese and ethnic Chinese who stayed behind . <> <> Threat of Sterner Measures // If the closed camps do not reduce the migration , Hong Kong officials say , they are willing to impose yet sterner measures . The Secretary of Security , David Jeaffreson , has suggested sending refugees home against their will. // The proposal was opposed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , and there is no reason to believe Vietnam would accept these people . Still , the idea of " involuntary repatriation " is under discussion. // " We can not just go on providing unlimited accomodations to refugees who want transit to the U.S. or to Europe , " Mr. Leeks said . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor is he troubled by the prospect that he may never become a prime candidate for resettlement in the United States. // " I don ' t think of that , " he said .
