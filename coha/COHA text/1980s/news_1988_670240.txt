CLEVELAND  --  Lamson &; Sessions Co. is getting a good payoff this year for joining the age of plastic . The company in the past 18 months has converted from a maker of iron , steel and aluminum parts for railcars and trucks to a concern that gets two-thirds of its sales from plastic products . As a result , the company will report sharply higher profit for the first quarter and expects an earnings gain for all of 1988 , John B. Schulze , president , said . However , the switch has made Lamson &; Sessions vulnerable to a possible shortage of plastic resins , he said . Mr. Schulze said the company ' s Carlon unit , which accounted for 64% of last year ' s sales , had a particularly strong first quarter . Carlon produces plastic electrical conduit and related fittings , and plastic sewer pipe and fittings . Sales of truck frames , aircraft fasteners and bearings , and European automotive fasteners  --  the company ' s other continuing businesses  --  also are doing well , he said . But the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Sessions purchased Carlon in late 1986 , after suffering a severe battering in its railroad car parts , foundry and truck parts businesses earlier in the decade that brought it to the brink of bankruptcy . The company expects to sell the last of its railcar operations this year , as well as a small producer of truck engine parts and a manufacturer of heat exchangers for the petrochemical industry , Mr. Schulze said . Reserves from previous years are expected to cover any losses on the sales , he said . The year is off to a strong start because the Carlon unit didn ' t have a typical sales slowdown last winter , Mr. Schulze said . The first quarter customarily is a weak one for construction products , including Carlon ' s . In the 1987 first quarter , Lamson &; Sessions earned from continuing operations only $356 , 000 , or five cents a share , on sales of $74. 1 million . After a one-time tax credit , net income was $479 , 000 , or seven cents a share . For all of 1987 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or 74 cents a share , on sales of $340. 4 million . Net income was $9. 8 million , or $1. 14 a share , including a $660 , 000 loss from discontinued operations and a one-time tax credit of $3. 7 million . Fully-diluted share earnings were 65 cents for continuing operations and 94 cents for net income . Lamson &; Sessions said it is likely to exhaust its tax-loss carry-forward this year , but now can shield about $15 million of pretax profit from income taxes . Sales in 1988 will surge , in part reflecting higher prices of plastic products , Mr. Schulze said . He declined to make a specific estimate , but said sales won ' t reach $400 million . Mr. Schulze said a broader product line may be helping stabilize Carlon ' s sales , with industrial and consumer sales offsetting some seasonal decline in construction . Also , more cities are using plastic electrical and drainage products , he said . The possibility that the tight market for polyvinyl chloride resin , Carlon ' s principal raw material , will escalate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1988 profit rise , Mr. Schulze said . Reflecting improved financial health , Lamson &; Sessions will spend two to three times as much for plant and equipment in 1988 as the $6. 1 million spent in 1987 , Mr. Schulze said . Investment and increased working capital needs can be met from internally generated cash and bank credit lines , Gene F. Budd , senior vice president , finance and administration , said . Lamson &; Sessions is seeking one or more additional acquisitions , Mr. Schulze said . Management is particularly interested in plastics concerns that would beef up sales outside the construction industry . He said the company also would consider metal products companies.
