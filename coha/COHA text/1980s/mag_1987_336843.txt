Talk about a preposterous plot . An obscure fundamentalist church in Boone , N.C. , raises millions of dollars from Ku Klux Klan members . The mission : to topple the governments of Kenya , Tanzania , Zambia and Zimbabwe . The conspiracy is carried out by American missionaries , all of them part of a sophisticated network that includes a satellite , a radio station and an oceangoing ship . <P> These details come not from a pulp adventure novel but from a fund-raising " memo " written on the stationery of the Foscoe Christian Church in Boone . Addressed to " Klu ( ( sic ) ) Klux Klan members , " it boasts that $80 million has already been collected to overthrow the governments opposing South Africa but that an additional $20 million is urgently needed . The memo goes on to laud missionaries in Kenya who are ostensibly working with " backward , stupid natives " but are actually attempting to oust Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi . <P> As absurd as that sounds , the memo is creating an uproar in Kenya . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dailies , it has led Moi to deport 15 American missionaries , some of whom have run schools in the impoverished countryside for more than a decade . " They claim to have come to work with us in our development efforts , " said Moi . " Their real work has been sabotage and destabilization . " But the State Department has branded the memo a " forgery " and the coup charges " patently absurd . " Said Paul Hamilton , one of the ousted missionaries : " We knew nothing about it . The government is paranoid . " <P> Kenyan newspapers will not say how they got the memo , but Hamilton believes it is the handiwork of David Kimweli , 33 , a Kenyan-born preacher who lives in Carrollton , Ga . For two years , Kimweli has toured parishes in the U.S. , raising money for missions in Kenya . Last February he visited Boone 's Foscoe Christian Church , where he told of whole villages converted from " witchcraft " to Christianity , of sight returned to the blind , of a woman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an electrifying message , " says Pastor Kenneth Caswell . <P> One of those he electrified was Hamilton , 37 , who met Kimweli when the Kenyan was studying at Johnson Bible College in Knoxville . Hamilton , a television technician , was so impressed that he sold his house and in July headed for Kenya with his wife Marty and three children . Once he got there , however , Hamilton found that Kimweli 's crusades did not exist . Enraged by the deception , he fired off letters to Kimweli 's American supporters and complained to U.S. embassy officials in Nairobi . <P> Then , suddenly , the memo appeared , fingering Hamilton , his wife and the other missionaries who had come to Kenya after hearing Kimweli 's sermons . Kimweli , reached in Savannah last week , claimed to know nothing about the memo . " It is confusing and embarrassing , " he insisted . He said he sent $4,000 to enlarge the church in his home village of Machakos and ten tons of clothing for distribution in the region . The dispute with Hamilton and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he explained . Meanwhile , a few chastened missionaries feel that they have been had . Rued + Hamilton : " If someone says , ' Hey , I 'm doing the Lord 's work , ' we do n't check his credentials . " And the government of Kenya apparently does not question the authenticity of unsigned memos.
