The lava is pumped by the same kind of machine that is used to shoot dog food into cans ( it could be nicknamed the Alpo Volcano ) . The Land ( sponsor : Kraft ) manages to meld a boat tour , environmental subjects ( topsoil loss , space-grown plants ) and musical cutups by such Audio-Animatronic vegetable performers as the Colander Combo and the Kitchen Krackpots led by a human being , Bonnie Appetit.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
