The Price of the Ticket , appears simultaneously with his latest work of nonfiction , The Lvidence of Things Not Seen , a small book on the trial of Wayne Williams , who was suspected of killing many black children and youths in Atlanta but put on trial only for two of these murders , as Baldwin reminds us again and again . It is a strange book . Little in it deals with either Atlanta , or the child killings , or the trial . Baldwin is suspicious of the trial . He does not believe Williams has been proved guilty ( neither does Abby Mann , who wrote the television film based on the case ) , but he tells us so little about the case and the trial that we can not be very clear about his reasons for thinking so . Most of the book consists of meditaphony Orchestra audibly present in their living rooms , indistinguishable from the orchestra in Symphony Hall , without the loss of a single overtone from cymbal or triangle .

Once their zeal has infected others previously contented with the placid issuance of a gentle musical entertainment from a comfy , reassuring phonograph incapable of parading the dazzle of the new records , the neophytes undergo the breathless excitement of discovery and revelation , renewed and renewed again as equipment is discarded and replaced by more elaborate or more accurate components . New values of reproduction are sought and eventually found , bit by bit , after disappointment , exasperation and expense . The original germ of discontent , cultivated , will produce progressively improved blooms , each bearing fertile seeds of untoward dissatisfaction . Yes , true , true . But just listen . tions or reflections or jeremiads that may have ' their origins in the ' circumstances of the Atlanta child murders and trial , but are familiar to us from Baldwin 's other nonfiction . It is a very hard hook to read . What we recall as the icy clarity of Baldwin 's prose , the precision of his writing ( he loves the word " precisely " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art ' still there , the wonderful quotations from spirituals and blues and the Bible . But all one gets is the rush of anger and despair over the black situation , and what whites have done to make it so . It was not always like this . Not that the tone of Hue Evidence of Things Not Seen is completely new ? one finds the same in much of the writing collected in The Price of the Ticket . But that is just the problem . The black situation has changed . America has changed . Baldwin has not . Or , insofar as he has , it has been to get angrier and less precise about the targets of his anger , and to give up all hope , it seems , for black existence and the black future in America . Which is strange indeed . His first pieces of writing date from 1948 . A good deal has happened since then . Among other things , Baldwin tells us in The Evidence of Things Not . Seen , we have had the only two presidents since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality at all . " But they are , " exquisitely , the exceptions that prove the rule . " We leave out comment on the word " exquisitely , " another Baldwin favorite . Why do they prove this rule ? They are , after all , two of our last five presidents . W HAI-EVER Baldwin 's expectations for blacks when he was a Young writer , he began his career by writing for journals that did have ( and do have ) hope for America , its race relations , and its minorities , that indeed were criticized for participating in and even creating the " American celebration . ' ' He remembers how he began , and with whom : " I will never , for example , forget Saul Levitas , the editor of The New Leader , who gave me my first hook review assignment sometime in 1946 .... " Levitas has probably never gotten a handsomer acknowledgment . But there were also Commentary and Partisan Review and Encounter and the Reporter , all of which surrounded Baldwin 's sharp prose enlightening white America on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for America , a hopefulness that subsequent years did not demonstrate to have been totally ill-founded . The very first essay in the collection , and Baldwin 's first substantial piece of writing , is " The Harlem Ghetto , " from Commentary in 1948 . I was on the editorial staff then ; how he came to us I do n't recall , but I do recall our pleasure that a remarkable young black writer - how remarkable we did n't vet know - had come to us . At that time , Commentary was a much more exclusively Jewish magazine than it would later become , and all we could think of suggesting to Baldwin was that he write about blacks and Jews . " The Harlem Ghetto " is much more than that . It exhibits a fully developed style as well as almost every theme that was to recur in Baldwin 's nonfiction , and indeed many that were to be part of his fiction . There is an immediate sense of the congestion and claustrophobia of Negro life in America , affecting every social class and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press , in all its variants ; on black leadership ? political , lay , and clerical ; observations on the difficulties of black intellectuals in relating to the black community , which were not so different from the difficulties Jewish intellectuals writing in Commentary then had in relating to the official Jewish community . " The Negro press , " Baldwin wrote , " supports any man , providing he is sufficiently dark and well-known ? with the exception of certain Negro novelists accused of drawing portraits unflattering to the Negro race . " Which is exactly what a Jewish writer , thinking of the difficulties of Isaac Rosenfeld and Philip Roth ( sometime later ) , might have written . A ND HE describes the complex relationship between Negroes and Jews with remarkable sensitivity , by way of analysis of an archetypal sermon . It begins with the traditional accusation that the Jews killed Christ , " which is neither questioned nor doubted , " but the term Jew actually operates to include all infidels of white skin . . .. The preacher begins by accusing the Jews of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catalog of their subsequent sins and the sufferings visited upon them by a wrathful God . But he is also describing " the trials of the Negro , while the sins recounted are those of the American republic . " " At this point , " Baldwin writes , " the Negro identifies himself almost wholly with the Jew . " The imagery of the Old Testament is taken over to describe Negro suffering . " The images of the suffering Christ and the suffering Jew are wedded with the image of the suffering slave . " But then there is the reality of the living Jews in Harlem : " small tradesmen , rent collectors , real estate agents , and pawnbrokers : they operate in accordance with the American business tradition of exploiting Negroes , and they are therefore identified with oppression and hated for it . " There is much else in these few pages , which are worth rereading today ? one will of course notice wryly that the disappearance of the few Jewsfrom Harlem has done nothing to improve matters . But my point is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jew and Negro , of symbols and reality , in the ghetto . An incredibly distinctive voice came from a 24-year-old whose last formal education had been in a New York City high school . Where had he acquired that voice , so stinging and so elegant ? It was a mystery , but a circle of editors , almost all Jewish , were ready to listen to , and publish , whatever he had to say . IT WAS NOT until the late 1950s that Baldwin broke away from the New **26;3069;TOOLONG Review-Encounter connection , and began to publish in magazines and journals of wider circulation . The road to Playboy , which sent him to Atlanta to cover the story of the murdered children , was reached through the friendly and accepting channels of the New York intellectuals . And the notes of hope ? particularly when Baldwin wrote from Paris , where he covered a Congress of Negro and African writers for Encounter in 1951 , and compared French justice less than favorably with American in Commentary in 1950 ? were not completely absent even in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Paris Congress : For what ... distinguished the Americans from the Negroes who surrounded us , men from Nigeria , Senegal , Barbados , Martinique .. . was the banal and abruptly quite overwhelming tact that we had been born in a society , which , in a way quite inconceivable for Africans , and no longer real for Europeans , was open , and , in a sense which has nothing to do with justice or injustice , was tree . One will find nothing like this in Baldwin 's writing since the civil rights revolution . Indeed , one would think , in the light of his blazing rhetoric since the early 1970s , that the movement had failed rather than succeeded . . Fo Baldwin it has failed , as he writes in The Evidence of Things Not Seen : " Others may see American progress in economic , racial , and social affairs ? I do not . I pray to be wrong , but I see the opposite , with murderous implications , and not only in North America . " One hesitates to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet his very excess will lead many readers to involuntarily contrast what they think is happening in America with what Baldwin insists is the case . Consider the following ( before the 1980 election ) : " In a couple of days , blacks may be using the vote to outwit the Final Solution . " Or : " The educational system of this country is , in short , designed to destroy the black child . It does not matter whether it destroys him by stoning him in the ghetto or by driving him mad in the isolation of Harvard . " And if one were to respond in amazement , " Black students are being destroyed at Harvard ? " Baldwin would undoubtedly answer , " White students are being destroyed there , too . " Little distinction is made among blacks ? or among whites . Blacks are slaves , and have remained slaves . ( But whites are slaves , too . ) There is the same lack of specificity when Baldwin recurs ( as he does on occasion ) to the black-Jewish theme of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Negroes are anti-Semitic because they are anti-White " ( New York Times Magazine , 1967 ) , the voice becomes harder and harsher . The Jews are subsumed completely in the denunciation of white America ( " the Negro is really condemning the Jew for having become an American white man " ) . One wants to protest , there are differences among Jews , and among whites . But it is all swept away in rhetoric . All this disables Baldwin from offering any precise or differentiated account of what goes on in America ? and particularly of the panic over the murdered black children and the subsequent trial in Atlanta . For Baldwin , nothing has changed in America ; it is as if he is frozen in a time capsule . The passage of time has only had the effect of dulling his perception of the distinctions and subtleties that were evident to him 30 years ago . W RITING of the Atlanta child killings and the trial of Wayne Williams , Baldwin draws parallels and makes references to scarcely relevant and distant events . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is this that " precipitated the ' official ) hue and cry . " This reminds Baldwin of Emmett Till , another black boy visiting in the South from the North , who whistled at a white woman and was killed for it . But what indeed is the connection ? That Atlanta 's black establishment only takes account of Northern blacks , not its own native citizens ? That Southern whites now as then kill black boys for uppityness ? In Baldwin 's mind there is a connection ; in the reader 's there can only he mystification . Another distant event of which he is reminded by the Williams trial : the Rosenberg case . What possible connection can exist , one wonders ? Well , Baldwin doubts the testimony in the Williams case . It might have been fabricated : . . . a State , that , fur example , could kidnap Morton Sobell out of Mexico , disguising it as a deportation , and slaughter the Rosenbergs by insisting that a table bought from Macy 's was actually a gift from the Russians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murders so many people , daily , domestically , and globally , and th the MOM ' 01 freedom ! ? yes , this State is quite capable of railroading a man to prison , and to death , by means of a false document . But that was a spy case , and a federal case , and what possible interest could the FBI have in fabricating evidence in the Williams case ? B ALDWIN has become an accusing voice , but the accusation is so broad , so general , so all-embracing , that the rhetoric disappears into the wind . No one escapes , nothing is to he done , and we can only await " The Fire Next Time . " There is enough that is badly amiss with blacks to justify gloom and foreboding , and ves , expectations of disaster . But just what is amiss ? It is not , it can not he , that blacks serve on juries , or become mayors or police chiefs or judges , or become middle class . Yet all this makes no difference to Baldwin at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider why , if such progress has n't made a difference , it has n't . " I agree with the Black Panther position concerning black prisoners , ? he wrote in No Ninth ' m the Street in 1972 . " Not one of them has ever had a fair trial . . . , white middle-class America is always the jury . and this fact is not altered , it is rendered even more implacable , by the presence of one or two black faces in the jury box . " Is one wrong to detect here that kind of recent French philosophical logic that reverses traditional French clarity ? the logic by which one demonstrates a point not de-vac the existence of opposite facts , but because of them ? How could the situation be " rendered even more implacable " by the presence of black jurors ? One grasps for an explanation . Because the blacks are forced to accept white logic ? Because they are intimidated by whites ? What ? His friend is the mayor of Atlanta , the police chief is black , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power still lies in white hands and whites are exclusively responsible for black distress . As Baldwin has become more famous and admired , and indeed as the black condition has changed ? things that happened to him as a teenager working in various places in New York could never happen to black teenagers now ? Baldwin has become , yes , more " implacable . " One can not help but think that his long residence in France must have something to do with it . When one reads ( in 1972 ) that " some pale , compelling nightmare . . . is responsible for the irresponsible ferocity of the Omnibus Crime and Control and Safe Streets Act , " one detects the unsteady observation of the visiting French leftist intellectual , and can only smile . Who now remembers that act ? When one reads , in the introduction to The Price of the - Ficket , that " a mob is not autonomous : it executes the real will of the state , " or that its ideas ( " that the Jews killed Christ or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " come from the state , which creates and manipulates the mob , " one seems to hear that common leftist interpretation of the world that was dominant in France for so long . Baldwin is still worth reading , for One of the most serious charges that can he leveled against any country 's policymakers is that , the war having been won , they have somehow managed to lose the peace . Thus they stand accused not only of making nonsense of their nation 's sacrifices , but also of creating dilemmas with which following generations have to contend . It was many things : for the early essays in particular ; for the rhetorical power of The lire Next Time ; for the snatches of autobiography , as in The Devil Finds Work , where he does make distinctions ( and in which whites appear as individuals , not wrapped in an all-embracing thunder ) ; for the wonderful analyses of the movies of the white world that a very sensitive and gifted young black boy saw ( in the company sometimes of a white teacher or another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . But his vision of America seems increasingly to be shaped by projections made up of inner nightmares and crude leftist pictures of America . We have nightmares enough of our own , God knows , and the Atlanta child murders ? which have been repeated again and again in recent years , with whites in all roles ? are one of them . But I find little illumination now in a rhetoric that once struck me as sharp and precise , yet now wraps everything in darkness and disaster .
