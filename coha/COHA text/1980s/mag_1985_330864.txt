The Olympic Games can be almost as important to broadcasters as they are to athletes . The network that carries the Games can usually count on huge worldwide audiences and hundreds of millions of advertising dollars . As an added bonus , viewers tend to go on watching the network 's shows for months after the competition ends . Last week the International Olympic Committee announced that NBC had won the rights to the 1988 Games in South Korea by agreeing to pay the Seoul Olympic Committee at least $300 million . If the Games generate enough ad revenues , the network could pay as much as $500 million . <P> The $300 million minimum that NBC agreed to spend was well above the $225 million that ABC paid to broadcast the 1984 Los Angeles Games but far less than the $600 million that the South Koreans had been seeking . The 1988 price reflects the eleven- to 14-hour time difference between the U.S. and Korea , which means that some of the most popular events will not be seen live by a large part of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadcasts than it did in 1980 , when a U.S.-led boycott of the Moscow Games resulted in a $34 million loss for the network .
