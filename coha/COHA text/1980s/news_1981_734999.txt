txt ? The nation 's air traffic controllers union rejected a S40 million-a-year contract offer by the government yesterday , increasing the chances of a strike Monday morning . In a press conference , Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis said the controllers had walked out of informal talks . He added that the government would take a tough stand against the strike , which would be ille ? gal as controllers are federal employes . The government will seek stiff civil and criminal penalties against the union  --  the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization  --  and individual strikers , Mr. Lewis asserted . The union , meanwhile , says a strike vote can be completed and a walkout begun in seven hours . If the controllers do strike , airlines ' schedules will be scrambled , with many planes arriving hours later than is usual . Because of this , passengers trying to make connections to other flights will be foiled . The airlines will sustain major revenue losses and will face much higher costs because they wo n't be able to use their fleets efficiently . United Airlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses Chicago as a hub , where tens of thousands of its passengers connect from one flight to another in a carefully timed sequence . But if controllers strike , United 's Chicago operations " would be destroyed , " as one analyst puts it . United declined to comment . Other carriers operating hubs , as Eastern Airlines and Delta Air Lines do at Atlanta , would face similar problems . Relying on Federal Aviation Administration supervisors to take the places of some striking controllers . Eastern plans to make about 570 of its usual 1,600 daily flights . Delta hopes to fly about 535 out of its total of 1,600 . But because of the odd hours the flights would have to depart , there would n't be any pattern of connections . " We 're tearing our hair out trying to figure out how to operate as best we can , but its still going to be a terrible mess . " sums up the operations vice president of a major airline . The basic reason for the looming problems is that the schedule of flights drawn up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any other normal commercial factors . Instead , it 's based mainly on the FAA 's estimate of how many flights its supervisors can handle safely in , say , one hour 's time . With this in mind , the FAA has spread flights evenly throughout the day , rather than bunch them at peak travel times . In addition , to make sure the system is safe , the FAA has cut sharply the total number of flights and will increase spacing between the remaining aircraft . The result is a schedule that is hardly convenient for travelers . One Eastern flight heading for Atlanta , for example , will depart San Francisco at 2:25 a.m . Even if the schedule is flown initially , the airlines will have trouble getting their planes back in position . " You can get from A to B , but there 's no assurance you can get that plane and crew back from B to A , " says one airline executive . In addition , instead of turning a plane around in two hours and bringing it back to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some cases . " We 're going to have planes and crews sitting around all over the country doing nothing but waiting their turn , " the airline executive says . The result will be extremely costly to the carriers , he adds . His own airline expects average daily use of aircraft to be cut in half , from about nine to 4 ? , hours . That , he says , is a money-losing level of operations . At the news conference , Mr. Lewis said the FAA 's contract proposal committed the agency to seeking legislation that would : ? Give a 10% pay raise to controllers who give on-the-job training and increase the current night  --  shift differential to 20% from 10% . ? Reduce controllers ' 40-hour work week by 6% through a 30-minute paid lunch period every day , ? Pay a year 's severance pay to certain experienced controllers who must resign for medical reasons . Joined by FAA Administrator J. Lynn Helms , Mr. Lewis said he also Is willing to let controllers " take an advisory role " in setting air-safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , retain Its management prerogatives , " the two officials noted In a prepared statement . The union is seeking a greater voice for controllers in setting air-safety policies and FAA support for much more generous legislation to boost their wages and benefits . The union , whose members now average $33,000 a year for a five-day week , Is seeking an average of $52,000 for a four-day week . The bill also would provide cot-of-living adjustments twice a year and-earlier retirement . The bill , languishing In a House subcommittee , would cost the Treasury S1.1 billion a year , Mr. Lewis has estimated . Meanwhile , more than 30 Senators warned the union that a strike may jeopardize any legislation 's chances of passage . In r a letter sent today to union president Robert Poll , they said they " will vigorously oppose any measure " to Improve controllers ' compensation that results from " any illegal job action . " The Senate Commerce Committee drafted the letter , staffers said . If there is a strike , passengers trying to fly overseas may face special problems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own labor dispute . As a result , Pan American World Airways had to cancel some flights to London yesterday , while another was eight hours late . Laker Airways canceled two of its three flights , with the remaining flight scheduled to leave hours late . If the U.S. controllers walk out too , service across the North Atlantic , one of the busiest travel routes In the world , could become totally disrupted . Many flights headed from the U.S. to Europe are guided for Jong distances by Canadian controllers . But the U.S. controllers union has been seeking the cooperation of the Canadian union , which might help disrupt flights . Despite the potential hardships for the public , some airlines are still squabbling to obtain competitive advantages . At a meeting in Washington a few days ago between the FAA and airlines , some airline officials " were complaining and screaming how they were n't allowed to make this or that flight , " says one participant . There also has been worry among security analysts about the financial impact of a strike on carriers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Braniff International . But John Casey , chairman of Braniff , said in an Interview that his airline should make it through a strike . " We would operate the maximum number of flights we could , perhaps a third of the total out of our Dallas base , and reduce staffing to the level required to handle that , " Mr. Casey said . With this plan , " we can get through this storm , if there is a storm . " Mr : Casey added , however , that many businessmen may choose to put off their travel it there is a controllers strike . " We will try to fly , but the big question Is , will there be any passengers ? " Mr. Casey said .
