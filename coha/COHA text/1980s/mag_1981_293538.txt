Older employees invoke a federal law to fight for their jobs <P> Harold Keane 's personnel file contained nothing but plaudits . But when a new boss took over , he wanted his own people and told Keane : " We 're reorganizing , and there 's no place for you . " Keane , 47 , a $41,000-a-year director of budgets and administration for Amtrak in Washington , D.C. , was dismissed and replaced by a man of 28 . Says Keane : " I was n't going to let them get away with it . " With the help of his lawyer , Joseph Guerrieri , he sued Amtrak under the 1967 Age Discrimination in Employment Act , which forbids age-based firings of workers between 40 and 70 , and won $202,000 in back pay and damages . <P> Keane is one of thousands who have invoked the act . Detroit Lawyer V. Paul Donnelly , who has nearly 300 such cases pending in 35 states , sees this job struggle as the " civil rights movement of the ' 80s . " Last year the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission ( EEOC ) doubled , to 8,000 ; similar state and local agencies probably received another 8,000 . Under the federal law , all complainants must start at the EEOC , which tries to solve problems without filing lawsuits . Many , however , are put off by the commission 's 4,000-case backlog and its informal system of mediating disputes . They would rather take their fight to court , which they may do once their claim has been at the EEOC for 60 days . <P> Donnelly considers three factors in deciding whether he can successfully claim age discrimination : the employee 's performance , the reasons for his discharge , if any , and the age of his replacement . One Amtrak official now concedes privately that Keane 's boss was too " heavyhanded , " but he maintains that the reports in Keane 's folder gave far too flattering a picture of his capabilities . <P> Employers , in fact , often have legitimate reasons for letting older workers go .

" If you want security , " he argues , " you choose union jobs . But for bigger jobs and bigger bucks , you 've got to be amenable to being wiped out by new management . " When presented with such pragmatic arguments , however , juries tend to identify with the employee 's predicament rather than with management 's . <P> Jury trials have been available in most of these cases ever since a 1978 amendment - an especially welcome change to plaintiffs , since many jurors are old . <P> The law does have a key exception : dismissals may be justified if a certain age level is a bona fide occupational qualification . A television actor , for instance , could become too old to play a middle-aged character in a long-running series . Courts have also upheld age ceilings where public safety is at stake , as in the case of bus drivers . Even in such exceptions , deciding at what age to draw the line is a problem .
