There she stands , Miss Black America . With her impeccable face , sleek figure and supernova smile , she looks like a Cosby kid made in heaven . She stirs sentiments not of lust but of protectiveness and awe ; everybody around wants to adopt her , escort her or be her . And now this perfect creature picks up a microphone . Oh . You mean she sings too ? <P> Oh , yes . Whitney Houston can sing , and not just too . Beneath the Tiffany wrapping lie the supplest pipes in pop music . Her precocity and virtuosity , her three-octave range and lyrical authority , are , at 23 , scary . She can switch moods without stripping emotional gears , segueing from a raunchy growl to an angelic trill in a single line  --  no sweat . She coaxes the back-street torch song Saving All My Love for You until the song 's Other Woman sounds like a little girl lost in faded rapture . She stands up to the string section in that anthem of enlightened egotism , Greatest Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voltage . Then the synthesized percussion starts blasting , and she escalates into purring teen ecstasy for How Will I Know and her new hit I Wan na Dance with Somebody ( Who Loves Me ) .

And now , as she kicks off a summer-long tour of 45 concerts , she has done it again . Her new collection , Whitney , made pop-music history as the first album by a female singer to debut at No. 1 on Billboard 's pop chart . The album 's first single , I Wan na Dance with Somebody , scampered to the top of eight different Billboard hit lists , from Adult Contemporary to Crossover and from West Germany to Australia .

" She can get the kids on the dance floor , " says Narada Michael Walden , who produced I Wan na Dance and six other cuts on her new album , " then turn around and reach your grandmother . " <P> Grandma better get ready to boogie . From the very first cascading wooooo ! on I Wan na Dance , the new album showcases a Whitney Houston who sings bolder , blacker , badder . This Whitney does n't just want to dance with somebody , she wants " to feel the heat with somebody , " and the vocal scorches . The rest of the album  --  a mixture of party songs and love songs  --  displays its star 's subtler readings , greater vocal nuance , more dynamism and control . On the jazzy ballad Just the Lonely Talking , she eases into an adventurous scat duet with an alto sax . But she can still sing it straight and sweet , as in Michael Masser 's romantic elegy Did n't We Almost Have It All , an instant standard with a spiraling melodic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
