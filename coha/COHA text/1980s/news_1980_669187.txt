At issue is not only the oft-argued question of using public funds to terminate unwanted pregnancies of poor women , but effort to prevent , or at least discourage , abortions. // Buoyed by last June ' s US Supreme Court decision in their favor and the prospects for support from incoming President Ronald Reagan and a more conservative Congress , so-called " pro-life " forces are all the more determined to press their cause. // In a mild reversal of the conservative trend , the post-election session of the outgoing Congress liberalized the language in an appropriations measures affecting federal financing of abortions . The House accepted Senate-approved language permitting funding of pregnancy terminations for women victims of incest or rape , if the victimization is reported within 72 hours. // Meanwhile , proposals to make it a lot harder for women , especially minors , to get an abortion are being readied in at least two dozen states , including California , Connecticut , Illinois , Michigan , New Hampshire , New York , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and Rhode Island. // In Michigan , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restriction measure on the books similar to one vetoed recently by Gov. william Milliken . Legislative override efforts succeeded in the state Senate but failed narrowly in the House. // New York lawmakers will be pushed anew to tighten the statute permitting medicaid financing of " medically necessary " abortions under which some 60 , 000 pregnancies a year are ended . " We have one of the most liberal laws in the nation , and , as administered , it amounts to little more than abortion on demand at taxpayers ' expense , " charges Joan Algaier , legislative director of the state ' s Right to Life Committee. // While disappointed over the verdict by the nation ' s highest court in upholding the right of Congress to refuse abortion funding in most instances , leaders of the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , the Planned Parenthood League , and various women ' s rights groups are not about to give up. // Their prime focus , however , has shifted to the states , 17 of which , along with the District of Columbia , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Involved are state supreme court suits in California , Massachusett , and New Jersey challenging on state constitutional grounds the legality of statutes banning public funding for ending pregnancies , except those resulting from rape or incest or when the woman ' s life is deemed threatened. // Foes of the Bay State law , which has been stayed pending resolution of the suit , are guardedly optimistic concerning their prospects for success because the " equal protection " provision of the Massachusetts constitution in past past have been found broader than the protective language of the US Constitution. // In addition , the commonwealth , unlike the nation , has an equal rights amendment which those fighting the restrictive statute contend makes it impossible to prohibit a woman from having an abortion simply because she can not afford to pay for one // If the Massachusetts high court agrees and declares the funding restriction law unconstitutional on those grounds , a move to repeal the ERA seems likely . That process would take at least three years to complete. // Passage of the abortion funding restraints was strongly supported by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Edward J. King and a substantial majority of state lawmakers. // A pastoral letter by Humberto Cardinal Medeiros of the Boston Roman Catholic Archdiocese last September , a few days before the Massachusetts primary , reminded members of the church of its strong stand against abortion and warned against voting for candidates who advocate " freedom of choice. " // Despite this , two liberal Democrats  --  US Rep. James Shannon and State Rep. Barney Frank , a congressional candidate in a neighboring district against whom the move was primarily directed  --  were elected. // Besides the three states where litigation is pending , 14 others were paying for medicaid abortions as of Nov. 1 : Alaska , Colorado , Connecticut , Goergia , Hawaii , Louisiana , Maryland , Michigan , New York , North Carolina , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Washington. // The US Supreme Court in its June 30 split decision ruled that states are under no obligation to provide abortion funding for poor women. // This despite the justices 1973 landmark decision that a woman ' s Cosntitution-guaranteed rights include not having to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving anti-abortion regulations or laws in at least 21 states are in various stages of litigation in federal and state courts , including one before the nation ' s highest tribunal. // The Supreme Court , which two years ago struck down a Massachusetts law mandating parental consent before a minor could have an abortion , is expected to rule by the end of its current session on a Utah measure requiring a doctor to notify the parents of a minor daughter seeking to end her pregnancy. // Similar laws in several other states are already under challenge in lower courts , and the outcomes of those suits hinge on what the nine justices decide in the Utah case. // A federal appeals court in Boston , for example , has under consideration a measure passed last June in Massachusetts that requires an abortion-seeking minor to obtain either parental consent or permission from a judge . This alternative , in the opinion from a backers , has removed whatever objections the Supreme Court had in decreeing the previous law unconstitutional. // The consent meaure , which has to have taken effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pending the court ' s decision on its validity . A similar statute enacted in Louisiana has been temporarily blocked by the court . The suit is scheduled for trial in April . The Massachusetts case was argued in October , but the judges have not yet ruled. // Regardless of which side wins , an appeal to the US Supreme Court seems all but certain. // The Massachusetts " informed consent " statute , as it is called , also requires that any woman seeking an abortion must be provided information concerning the procedures , the risks involved , and alternatives to ending the unwanted pregnancy . In addition there is a 24- hour waiting period required. // Such provisions are in effect in Akron , Ohio , and in all of Tennessee except the city of Nashville. // Waiting periods of 24 hours or 48 hours are on the books in Illinois , Kentucky , Louisiana , and Maine , but implementation is delayed pending the outcome of court challenges. // Besides the original Massachusetts parental consent measure , anti-abortion statutes in at five states  --  Illinois , Louisiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been struck down by courts during the past 3 1/2 years. // //
