The pass hung in the cloudy California sky and with it hung the lead in the NFC West . That 's what it came down to on Sunday , after 59 minutes and five seconds of a typically nasty game between the Los Angeles Rams and New Orleans Saints . // Both teams came in with 7-3 records and a share of the division lead , and now , with : 55 showing on the clock and New Orleans leading 14-10 , Los Angeles was deep into its final drive of the day . The play began on the Saints ' 26 , first-and-20 . As it unfolded , L.A. quarterback Jim Everett looked hard toward Henry Ellard , who was operating out of the slotback position . // Ellard , coming down the seam , was the logical receiver , and that 's just what Everett , the NFL 's top-rated quarterback , wanted Saints strong safety Gene Atkins to think . Atkins had deep responsibility in the double-zone  --  check the middle , check the outside and make a choice . Everett pumped once and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was heading down the right side toward the end zone . It was a timed pattern : Everett was to lay the ball up ; Anderson was to run under it . // Saints cornerback Dave Waymer had the coverage underneath . Anderson got behind him , and for a moment it looked as if the Rams would pull out a game in which their offense had been contained . " He tried to look me off to the seam guy , " said Atkins , a second-year pro out of Florida A &amp; M. " He tried to get me hung up with the pump fake . I did n't bite . I just tried to get enough depth so I could get a good break on the ball . " // And there it was , hanging , hanging for what seemed like an hour . Atkins streaked across the end zone and took the ball out of Anderson 's hands for an interception . An afternoon of football had come down to one play . // New Orleans coach Jim Mora found the victory particularly satisfying because a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  his whole career as a college and pro assistant coach was on the defensive side  --  but in the Saints ' two previous games , his defense had failed down the stretch . On Oct. 30 in New Orleans , the Rams had held the ball for the last 4:01 to preserve a two-point win . A week later in Washington , the Redskins drove 94 and 64 yards to score 10 fourth-quarter points for a three-point win over New Orleans . " We just could n't find a way to get off the field , " said Saints inside linebacker Vaughan Johnson last week . // Coming into last week 's game , New Orleans , the only NFC team that has n't lost by two touchdowns or more in at least one game this season , had dropped three games by a total of six points . And in the Rams , New Orleans would face a multifaceted attack , thanks to Everett 's improvement , the result of understanding L.A. 's system better and of reading defenses more clearly . Mora knew he had to come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mora is n't a devotee of the blitz , but last week he had free safety Brett Maxie rush up the middle , and he occasionally used Johnson on the blitz . At 6 ' 3 " , 245 pounds , Johnson is an unusual athlete who is agile enough to stay on the field in most of the nickel-and-dime defenses . To pick up speed on the outside rush , Mora positioned outside linebacker Rickey Jackson as a down lineman on the left side . Another linebacker , Pat Swilling , was down on the right flank . // Los Angeles , which will stick with the run until an opponent stops it , does n't usually hurt the Saints on the ground . In their first meeting of 1986  --  Mora 's first year in New Orleans  --  L.A. got a mere 53 yards rushing in a 6-0 defeat . It was the only game that season in which the Rams failed to run for at least 100 yards . Last year , in the lone nonstrike meeting between the teams , Los Angeles rushed for 102 yards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 96 on the ground . Those are anemic numbers for a John Robinson-coached team . // But Everett had scared New Orleans in that Oct. 30 game by going long often and accurately . Several dropped passes kept Los Angeles from scoring more points than they did . Something had to be done to shake up the young quarterback. // New Orleans sacked Everett once on Sunday  --  on a safety blitz by Antonio Gibson  --  but he was under constant pressure . His statistics were unimpressive : 18 completions in 35 attempts for 198 yards , two interceptions and no TDs . The Saints controlled the early going  --  at one point in the second quarter they had run 30 plays to L.A. 's nine and led in time of possession , 17:05-4:31 . Only a weird succession of breaks kept the Rams in the game . // On their first possession , the Saints drove 81 yards to the Los Angeles two , but the march ended with an interception in the end zone . Their next possession ended with an interception as well . The third was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rams ' 27 , a 52-yard field goal at the end of the first half that was nullified by a holding penalty and a 52-yard field goal try in the third quarter that hit the crossbar and bounced away . " We dominated the game , but we only had seven points , " said New Orleans quarterback Bobby Herbert afterward . " It was a frustrating thing . " // After the missed field goal , the Rams , who had three points on the Anaheim Stadium scoreboard , took over on their own 34 . When Everett dropped back to pass on first down , Maxie blitzed clean up the middle , forcing him to overthrow fullback Buford McGee . Johnson intercepted the pass on the L.A. 41 and , in a remarkable display of broken-field running , hurdled McGee , sidestepped guard Tom Newberry , put a matador move on Everett and reached the seven-yard line before tackle Irv Pankey brought him down . Two sweeps by Rueben Mayes made the score 14-3. // The Rams mounted two more meaningful drives . The first one , which covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Pete Holohan catching a short pass and lateraling to Ellard , that went for 21 yards ; a reverse by wideout Ron Brown for two yards ; and a one-yard touchdown run on fourth-and-goal off a veer option play in which Everett handed off to McGee , who was running wide . McGee then pitched to tailback Greg Bell . Very un-Ramlike football . // That made the score 14-10 in the Saints ' favor . New Orleans stopped L.A. on the Rams ' two subsequent possessions before Los Angeles got the ball on its own 30 for one last shot with 2:12 remaining . Four plays , a penalty against the Saints and one against the Rams put the ball on the New Orleans 26 , where Everett threw that last pass . // " We were anticipating that play , where Everett pump-fakes to the inside receiver and then goes sideline , " said Atkins . " We worked on it all week . " // " This win was much bigger than big , " said Mora . " This was a gigantic win for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offensive coordinators of the teams that New Orleans will face down the road something to think about . In molding the Saints , who were the laughingstock of the league when he took over , into a contender , Mora has earned a reputation as a fundamentally sound coach who relies on execution rather than gimmicks . But this time his defense showed new wrinkles . More important , it held the Rams to 60 yards rushing and shut down Everett . // Johnson , who has been described by New Orleans coaches as one of football 's most underrated linebackers , had a magnificent game . He was on the field for every defensive play . His interception set up the clinching TD . He put pressure on Everett , made the primary hit on two straight goal-line plays and was the first man downfield on punts . " I 'm a coverage linebacker , " he says , " and those are n't the guys who make All-Pro or get the Pro Bowl votes . Sacks are what people look at . I 've taken pride in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anderson or a Herschel Walker . When I was with Jacksonville , I made All- USFL , but who remembers something like that ? // " The important thing today was that we showed we could play defense in the finesse situations , third-and-long . When we were struggling , we would stuff a team on the first two downs and then something would happen  --  a missed tackle , a mistake  --  and we 'd have to start all over again . " // The remainder of the Saints ' schedule is rough but not impossible  --  the Denver Broncos and the New York Giants at home , followed by the Minnesota Vikings and San Francisco 49ers on the road and the Atlanta Falcons in New Orleans . Now that the Saints have a one-game lead in the NFC West , you get the feeling that they 'll be tough to dislodge . Maybe that 's what Mora meant when he talked about Sunday 's " gigantic " victory .
