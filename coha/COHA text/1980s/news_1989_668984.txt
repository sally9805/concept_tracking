Talk , talk . . . - To lead , or not to lead : A lingering concern within the Big 10 is the eligibility of freshmen , and conference officials continue to discuss banning them from varsity competition . A few years ago , in fact , its schools and those in the Pac-10 came close to doing just that . " Our feelings were that if our two conferences moved in that direction-and maybe enticed another conference or some major independents to join us-that others might come along , " remembers Michigan State President John A. DiBiaggio . " While the Big 10 was prepared to support that , and some schools within the Pac-10 supported that , they didn ' t have a majority . " " The Big 10 would still like to do it , but we ' re scared to death to do it unilaterally because of what it would do to recruiting , " adds Minnesota Athletic Director Rick Bay . " But there ' s also another school of thought , and I subscribe to it partially . It feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rest of the country would come along . So I ' m not as opposed to doing it unilaterally as some might be . " Says Northwestern AD Bruce Corrie , who supports the status quo : " I don ' t know how true that is , or if that ' s just wishful thinking. " - Rules redux : The requirement is stated clearly , and has been on the books for awhile . It states , simply , that a conference must play a full double round-robin during the regular season for its champion to automatically qualify for the NCAA Basketball Tournament . That is something to keep in mind the next time you hear talk of a Big 10 postseason tourney , which the coaches have generally supported only if their current full double round-robin conference schedule is cut back . . . . That tourney , by the way , is still as far away as ever , and there are now hints that it may never come to pass despite the vast amounts of money and exposure it would afford the Big 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom line-still favor the revenue-producing idea . Yet some of their presidents and chancellors-who must ultimately okay the plan-are bothered by the additional missed classes the tourney would necessitate . Says DiBiaggio , who is one of those : " I would be skeptical . I ' m only speaking as an individual here , but my view of that wouldn ' t be positive . In fact , I ' m worried about athletic schedules in general. " - In the beginning : Arizona is again primed to make a run at the national title , but the situation was much different when Lute Olson landed there from Iowa six years ago . The Wildcats had just finished a 4-24 season , their four top scorers and rebounders were not coming back and there were fewer than 14 recruiting days left until prospects signed letters-of-intent . " It was scary , " Olson recalls . " There weren ' t players in the program you could look at and say , If this guy progresses , if that guy progresses , we ' ll be okay . ' It wasn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second thoughts ? " Once I had the opportunity to see who was coming back , I wondered a little bit , " he admits . " Then , after our first practice , I really wondered . It was migraine headache time to realize how much work we had to do . But other than those two times , I never wondered . The reason I went is because I felt the program was a diamond in the rough. " - Hard to believe : Arizona forward Sean Elliott was an All-Everything last season , but now here is Oklahoma coach Billy Tubbs declaring , " I think he ' s shown improvement this year . " " No question . There ' s no comparison , " agrees Olson . " And what ' s nice about Sean is that he ' s aware that he ' s nowhere near where he could be. " - Names in the news : The grapevine lists Syracuse forward Derrick Coleman , Virginia Tech ( and Seoul Olympic ) guard Bimbo Coles and centers Dwayne Schintzius of Florida and Eldon Campbell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this year ' s NBA draft . . . . Dallas Mavericks ( and former Phoenix Suns ) coach John MacLeod , under fire from team owner Donald Carter , is reportedly a top candidate for the soon-to-be vacant Arizona State job . Purdue ' s Gene Keady , whose name is often tied to vacancies , is said to be another . . . . Eastern Illinois ' Jay Taylor , out of East Aurora , has already set a Panther career scoring record and is poised to break its single-season record as well . The 6-foot-3-inch senior is averaging 24. 5 points per game and has an outside shot at the AMCU single-season record held by current Golden State guard Winston Garland . . . . It ' s ironic that Rich Daly is the one guiding Missouri while Tiger head coach Norm Stewart recuperates from the attack that felled him last Thursday . Daly , you see , was hired to recruit , and is now known as " Dr. Detroit " after successfully landing a number of players from that city. - And finally : Oklahoma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kansas in the national title game : " It still lingers . It ' s really bad . At Coach ' s ( Tubbs ) camp , there were kids wearing T-shirts that said , Kansas . National Champions . ' That was hard to take . We ' ll never live that down , but we ' re looking at it now as unfinished business. "
