With his hybrid ideology , Gary Hart resists classification <P> Gary Hart embodies a lot of contradictions , and he knows it . He casts himself as the political avatar for younger Americans , yet he was born a decade before the baby boom , and turned 30 in the 1960s , just when people over 30 were not to be trusted . The presidential candidate whose campaign he managed in 1972 , George McGovern , ran against the Democratic Establishment from the hard left ; now Hart is running against the party Establishment , not exactly from the right or the left , but from off center . <P> " Our task , " says Hart 's Southern coordinator , David Garrett III , " is to show that Gary is an atypical politician who ca n't be characterized as liberal , conservative or moderate . " <P> There are personal paradoxes as well . <P> Hart can come across as chilly and passionless , but he turns angry-passionately so-when news stories describe him as " cool and aloof . " He has a reputation for humorlessness-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humor , " he says . " But if you have to tell someone you have a sense of humor , I guess you 're in trouble . " <P> If it were up to the candidate , such questions of personality would be kept out of the election . Indeed , Hart might prefer a campaign battle between position papers : his policy schemes vs . Walter Mondale 's and John Glenn 's , and may the best ideas win . Presidential politics is never so neat and bloodless , of course . Nor is Hart 's appeal strictly intellectual . His political successes are due in some measure to his rugged good looks , about which he is a bit vain . But by and large Hart has staked his candidacy on the premise that he takes undoctrinaire policy approaches , that among the Democratic contenders he alone offers " new ideas and a new vision for this country 's future . " <P> The claim is a cheeky one . Because campaign positions are inevitably reduced to sketchy impressions and shorthand phrases , Hart has been vulnerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new ideas . In fact , he bristles with notions about how Government should be run . Some sound sensible and promising , some trendy and impractical . Cynics say that Hart simply rediscovered an old marketing trick . " New faces , New Frontier , New Deal , new horizons , " chants Illinois ' Democratic state chairman , Calvin Sutker . " It 's always good to say something is new . " <P> But Hart 's freshness seems more than packaging . Many of his ideas have never been exposed on the national political stage . His emphasis on newness means , in many instances , that he will abandon liberal totems that have been outworn or misshapen . " The pragmatism of the New Deal has become doctrine , " he says . " We have saddled ourselves with expedients. "
