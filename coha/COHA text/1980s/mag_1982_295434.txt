The Presidency <P> Prowling a deep Atlantic Ocean trench , Captain Robin White tamps some stray wisps of tobacco into his squat pipe , looking more like a professor than the skipper of an attack submarine . He calculates that he and his men are about as far distant in the presidential command network as one could get . But he holds the lethal stings , and his crew are essential players in the military power game . Captain White knows that . <P> His young officers circle White at a lunch of steak , corn on the cob and strawberry shortcake . They have an intense curiosity about the White House and Presidents , about the center of a power structure that binds them and shapes their lives but that most will never personally hear or see . As nuclear engines throb quietly below the waves , they ask questions about the actions of Kennedy , Nixon and Carter . Perhaps they are too polite , or too young , to wonder out loud if Ronald Reagan knows what he is doing in this dangerous world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for a few hours in this cobalt fantasy world , the 14 officers and 115 men of the U.S.S. Atlanta-also known as SSN 712-seem to be the only collection of Americans not complaining , or demanding some thing from their Government . They are serving their country , and serving it well . <P> Dive . Dive . The klaxon sounds . Periscopes go down . The Atlanta , commissioned a month ago , is on a test run , honing ship and crew for duty , before they go on station as a stealthy picket in the outer rim of U.S. defense . Vice Admiral Steven White , Commander Submarine Force U.S. Atlantic Fleet , inspects his newest ward- The U.S.S. Atlanta on a sea trial in the Atlantic one of 81 submarines under <P> his command-listening to the language of men and machine that he knows so well . After 19 years of undersea duty , he can automatically feel and gauge a ship 's rhythm . <P> The Atlanta plunges and rises hundreds of feet , tilts and corners , its sonar banks collecting the undersea sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkened crevices of the hull . The torpedoes lie silent in their racks , waiting to be loaded and fired . <P> The mission is routine , uneventful . Nonetheless , in the back of every crewman 's mind is the knowledge that submarines like theirs in the British navy are deployed in icy waters around the Falkland Islands . They are outriders of the British task force that has been dispatched to uphold the rule of law and a nation 's honor . Those submarines may have to quit playing games and go into early combat . That thought is everywhere inside the Atlanta . <P> The prospect that a naval war could actually break out somewhere in the South Atlantic has changed the lives of the men aboard this submarine . They do not mention it , but they sense the sudden difference . So , in a less direct way , do the rest of us in the U.S. We also sense the impotence of too much power . The nuclear weapons that were trotted out of the military closet for symbolic effect by Harry Truman , Dwight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the globe 's trouble spots . Nuclear weapons can no longer intimidate the Soviets , who have as many of them as we do ; in the masses now assembled by both superpowers , those weapons threaten , if unleashed , a hideous end to civilization .
