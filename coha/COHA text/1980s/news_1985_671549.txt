Harry N. Walters , the Administrator of Veterans Affairs , warned that cutbacks in spending and staff could " ultimately result in a reduced quality of medical care " for veterans . He made the comment in a letter to the Office of Management and Budget , which wrote the proposals. // The draft 1987 budget , to be submitted to Congress in early February , would require many veterans to show financial need to receive care . It would also provide no money for new nursing homes for veterans even as the number of older veterans is rising rapidly because of the large number of men who served in World War II. // // Dispute on Nursing Homes // The proposal calls for a " new long-term care policy " emphasizing the use of community nursing homes and state institutions , rather than additional Federal facilities. // The Veterans Administration had sought seven new nursing homes , and Mr. Walters is appealing to Mr. Reagan ' s budget director , James C. Miller 3d , to permit at least " the two highest- priority projects , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At present the agency , which boasts the nation ' s largest medical care system , has 116 nursing homes with 11 , 072 beds. // Mr. Walters , in a letter to Mr. Miller , said the new policy on long-term care was " not practical " because " there are no community or state nursing home beds available in the affected areas . " <> <> Higher Efficiency Sought // The budget office said the Veterans Administration must increase productivity by 1 percent a year for the next five years . In a hospiital , the number of patients treated by a given number of employees in a given time might , for example , increase because of new technology. // The agency also must treat " fewer low-priority veterans , " the budget office said . It did not define such veterans. // Confidential budget documents show that the Office of Management and Budget expects that the level of spending would require the Veterans Administration to reduce the number of patients admitted to veterans ' hospitals by 62 , 000 , to 1. 2 million , in 1987 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinics by 1. 3 million , to 16. 5 million , in 1987 , and by another 1. 9 million , to 14. 6 million visits , in 1989. // These cutbacks would be accompanied by a shrinking of V.A. hospital staffs and other health-care resources for veterans . The number of Veterans Administration employees working on medical care programs would decline , under the President ' s budget proposal , from 193 , 941 in the fiscal year 1986 , which began Oct. 1 , to 185 , 039 in 1987 and 171 , 674 in the fiscal year 1991 , the documents show. // In the letter to Mr. Miller , Mr. Walters said he was " fully supportive of the need to exercise budget constraints " so long as they did not harm the quality of care . <> <> Nonmilitary Cuts Planned // The proposals for veterans ' programs in Mr. Reagan ' s 1987 budget are part of a larger White House package of nonmilitary budget cuts designed to reduce the Federal deficit to levels specified by a new law . The law seeks to balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will authorize the Government to collect reimbursement from private insurance companies and will establish some income-based eligibility test for veterans , though perhaps not the one being proposed by Mr. Reagan. // Both houses of Congress endorsed such changes earlier this month , but they adjourned last week without giving final approval to the legislation , which was included in a bill designed to save $74 billion over three years . <> <> Effect on Insurers // Under the bill , the Government could collect from private insurers the " reasonable cost " of care provided by the Veterans Administration to veterans with disabilities unrelated to their military service . The insurers would be legally obliged to pay for such care to the same extent as if the patient had been treated in a private hospital. // Many insurance contracts now preclude payment for care given by Federal hospitals . The bill would , in effect , invalidate such language in any contracts written after the proposal became law. // The income eligibility test envisioned by Mr. Reagan is more stringent than the one endorsed by key members of the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the age of 65 a veteran is automatically eligible for medical care on request , without regard to financial need , if space is available in a V.A. facility. // Under the Congressional proposal , the V.A. would have to provide hospital care to veterans with service-related disabilities . It would also provide care to those with disabilities unrelated to military service if they had income less than specified amounts : $15 , 000 a year for a single veteran , $18 , 000 for a veteran with one dependent ( plus $1 , 000 for each additional dependent ) . // The Government could decide , based on available resources , whether to care for people with higher incomes . Veterans without service-connected disabilities would have to contribute to the cost of their care - $492 for the first 90 days - if they had income exceeding $20 , 000 a year for a single person or $25 , 000 for a married couple . <> <> Administration ' s Proposal // Under the Reagan Administration ' s proposal , veterans without service-related disabilities who have family incomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay substantially more before they could qualify for V.A. health care. // In other budgetary areas , the White House approved $320 million for major V.A. construction projects in 1987 . That represents about half the $646 million that the agency said was needed to meet its commitments to veterans. // The Office of Management and Budget has apparently directed the Veterans Administration and other agencies to come up with specific amounts of property that can be declared surplus . The budget documents say that the V.A. ' s target is to list excess property with a market value of $364 million . If the property is not needed by another agency , it can then be sold , according to the General Services Administration. // Mr. Walters complained that two of the " excess properties " listed by the budget office were essential to the operation of veterans ' hospitals , in Los Angeles and Sepulveda , Calif . The property in Los Angeles , he said , provides " a much-needed buffer zone " between a veterans ' psychiatric facility and its neighborhood . <> <> Funds for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposing to eliminate funds for veterans who need special transportation , such as an ambulance or a wheelchair van , to get to a veterans ' hospital . Mr. Walters said eliminating this money was " not feasible , " and he asked the budget office to provide $10 million in 1987 for " emergency travel needs " of veterans. // Mr. Walters said the proposals would force his agency to defer new services that Congress just authorized for Vietnam veterans . The services include counseling on employment , vocational rehabilitation , alcohol and drug abuse and veterans ' benefits. //
