Of course , midsummer comes two months before the cotton harvest begins . The bolls are immature and still attached to their stalks . Yet , the absence of cotton and the profusion of clover - or berseem , at it ' s called here - give a visual impression not far from the economic reality of the Egyptian cotton industry. // // Cotton is the cash crop on which a large Egyptian textile industry is based and for which Egypt obtains vital receipts in hard currency on the world market . Exports of raw Egyptian cotton rank second , albeit distantly , to Egyptian crude oil. // But given the world oil glut , Egypt ' s predicted oil-production peak sometime this decade , and the recent leveling off of worker remittances from abroad , cotton could soon resume much of its former glory - especially if the government ' s fervent quest for more exports persists. // A problem looms , however . For Egypt , cotton is a moneymaker . For the Egyptian farmer , it ' s just a lot of ill-compensated work. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivate , is famous for long fibers that produce high-quality yarn . Developed by a French scientist in Cairo in the 1820s , long-staple cotton became Egypt ' s prime export during the cotton famine of the American Civil War . Later , during the colonial epoch , the British greatly expanded its cultivation. // Exported cotton created the modern Egyptian economy . Some historians maintain it also impoverished the Egyptian peasant , skewed the country ' s agricultural sector toward a single crop , and caused more problems than benefits. // Egyptian cotton cultivation peaked at 2. 1 million acres just after World War II . Since the 1950s , and especially in the last decade , that acreage has slipped by half , despite the reclamation of more than 1. 1 million additional acres of arable land from Egypt ' s agricultural nemesis , the desert. // Even so , Egypt ' s share of global long-staple cotton output remains about 45 percent . The United States is Egypt ' s biggest customer . But India , once a major client , stopped importing in the 1970s , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many Egyptian acres have been switched from cotton to cereals , so as to reduce Egypt ' s huge grain imports , and to berseem , a change many economists deem particularly wasteful. // Berseem , an agricultural legacy of the pharaohs , is the main source of animal forage in a country with a critical dearth of tillable land , let alone pasturage. // Chemically , a natural symbiosis exists betwen the two crops . Clover grows well in the nitrogen-depleted soil vacated by cotton , and cotton thrives on the nitrogens berseem returns to the ground. // But in the economic sphere , the crops oppose each other over Egypt ' s complex system of agricultural pricing. // ' ' Cotton demands a lot of work for nine months , ' ' says Dr. Hassan Khidr of the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture . ' ' There are insects , blight , complicated irrigation , high labor costs , and so on . Two small annual harvests of berseem , which matures in five months , give farmers more money than more months of cotton.

He condemns Egypt ' s 21-year-old agricultural pricing system as favoring a transfer of wealth from the countryside to the cities - a key cause for Egypt ' s staggering rate of urban migration. // ' ' Past policy directed farmers to grow crops not indirectly taxed through ( government ) producer prices , ' ' says Khidr . ' ' Thus they grow forage crops to feed the meat demanded by urban consumers. ' ' // Although fresh red meat , for sale only three days a week here , goes for a premium , its blow to the urban pocketbooks is softened by a separate system of consumer price subsidies on everything from bread to movie tickets. // At the government supermarket/restaurant across the street from the Agriculture Ministry , a light lunch of grilled kidney , pickled vegetables , bread , and lemonade costs the US equivaent of a quarter . A pound of fresh butter - from Europe or America - runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents. // ' ' If it were purely up to international economic forces , our red meat and berseem market would collapse , because we can import meat cheaper than we can produce it , ' ' says Khidr . ' ' Yet meat is a highly protected industry. ' ' // According to Dr. Khidr , the Egyptian government now focuses on the agricultural sector and realizes that farmers must get more out of what they produce , no matter what their crop. // But cotton presents difficult policy options , since the Egyptian economy depends on the export of raw cotton to help counter Egypt ' s chronic trade deficit . ' ' Cotton is a highly remunerative crop in terms of export revenues , ' ' says Khidr . ' ' But farmers get little of that remuneration , and the central government gets a lot.

A cotton glut might force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of raw cotton. // Since the late 1970s , Egypt has actually imported short-staple upland cotton from the United States and the Sudan to supply the state-owned and - operated Misr Spinning and Weaving mills , which were found to be producing inferior yarn from Egypt ' s superior cotton. // Over the last few years , however , new investment , some financed by the US Agency for International Development , has allowed the purchase of new spinning and weaving equipment. // Egyptian-made clothing woven from Egyptian cotton is now for sale under various brand names in Western Europe and the US , in addition to Egypt ' s traditional markets in Eastern Europe and the Arab countries. // Whatever Egypt ' s future cotton policy , the country must first contend with the problems of this year ' s harvest. // In July , according to the semiofficial newspaper al-Ahram , Egypt ' s projected 1985 production of 480 , 000 tons of cotton lint was in peril from rural labor shortages , caused by low wages ; the improper installment of new irrigation drainage equipment ; inadequate crop dusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink bollworm infestation. // //
