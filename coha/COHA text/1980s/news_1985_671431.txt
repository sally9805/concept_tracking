" What we have now , " Mr. Dale said with a laugh , " is a **28;1474; big <> bit of England in New York. " // But Mrs. Dale had her say , too : Hanging amid the Victoriana and the 19th-century English Arts and Crafts pieces are crocheted coats and other wearable art that she sells at Julie : Artisans ' Gallery , at 687 Madison Avenue , near 62d Street . Sometimes she takes the coats off her apartment ' s walls and wears them. // The Dales did their highly unusual apartment by themselves , " with no decorators at all , " said Mrs. Dale , who has a master ' s degree in art history from New York University. // " The apartment is a diary of our last four years together , " she said . " It ' s a totally joint effort by the two of us. " // Mr. Dale , who won a 1980 Tony award for his starring role in " Barnum " and who opens on Broadway March 27 in Peter Nichols ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " agreed . " In most cases like this , the husband usually doesn ' t take any interest , he just goes along with what his wife says , " he said . " But I ' m just as involved in it as Julie is . It ' s our hobby. " // The Dales , who were married in 1981 , have bought most of their pieces during their two or three trips to England each year . On one trip , they spotted a refectory table in the back of a truck on Kings Road . They flagged down the driver and asked him to set it up on the road , so they could get a better look . It is now in their dining room. // " Each piece is a memory of a particular day , from a particular trip we made , " Mrs. Dale said . " It started on our honeymoon , when Jim took me to the places in London and Bath he knew over the years . We looked in basements and back rooms , and I started seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I became tremendously excited , and that infected Jimmy. " // Among their favorite pieces are a triangular-seated harpist ' s chair by E. A. Taylor , three Gothic Revival throne chairs by Walter Cave , two Voysey carpets , and a large sideboard with inlaid flowers , birds and butterflies by Bruce Talbert . The living room also has a notable French period touch : The shield that stands in front of the fireplace is a large cast- iron balustrade , designed by the art nouveau master Hector Guimard as a detail in the Paris Metro , circa 1900. // About a half dozen pieces of wearable art , mostly elaborate handmade sweaters and coats , hang on the walls in various rooms in the apartment . One-of-a-kind pieces , they take up to a year of an artist ' s time to make , Mrs. Dale said . One of her favorites , she said , is " Julie ' s Coat , " a black and blue crocheted coat by Sharron Hedges. // " Periodically , I wear all of these pieces , " Mrs. Dale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them back up again . " She added : " Even though I wear them , they are **28;1504; not <> clothing . They are artworks meant to be worn. " // Other fiber artists represented in the apartment are Marika Contompasis , Arlene Stimmel , JoEllen Trilling , Mario Rivoli and Frank Heller. // A small sitting room in the rear of the seven-room apartment , known as the Victorian Room , is devoted almost entirely to the Victoriana that Mr. Dale collected before he married . Arranged in close order in cabinets and a Welsh dresser , it includes a collection of painted bread dough figures in glass domes , a collection of early glass slides and 19th-century china figurines . Low , cozy armchairs are covered by Victorian fabrics , thrown over loosely , and the sofa is piled with elaborate beaded needlepoint pillows. // " Here ' s a piece Mum and Dad bought me last year , " Mr. Dale said , gesturing toward a wooden ha ' penny board with the initials J.D. in ivory. // Another of his collections , of painted antique clowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room . He said he started the collection several years before he starred in " Barnum . " " I don ' t quite like clowns , they hide behind makeup , " he said . Then , picking one up and examining its small , smiling face , he added : " But could you help not collecting these ? " // A pattern-on-pattern theme is evident throughout the apartment , in the 500 English decorative tiles that hang in various rooms , in the fabrics and in the living-room walls curtained with 100-year-old tapestry draperies that Mr. Dale bought at house sales in England. // Hand-printed William Morris reproduction wallpaper in the Chrysanthemum pattern covers the walls in the dining room , and it was applied not by a professional , but by Mr. Dale himself . " I ' ve had 20 years ' experience wallpapering , " he said . He also wallpapered the panels of the pantry and kitchen cabinets in a 19th-century floral pattern , which serves as a background for the couple ' s collection of green majolica china. // Something of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maid ' s room into a workshop , where he has framed many of the 500 English and German tiles . He said he also does all of the rewiring of lamps , including the two Tiffany chandeliers , all of the picture framing and all of the varnishing in the apartment. // " That ' s his therapy , " Mrs. Dale said. // Her husband smiled . " People who say , ' I can ' t repair a fuse ' are idiots , " he said . " I mean , be a man and do it yourself ! " // He said he learned how to repair things during those lean years when he couldn ' t afford to hire other people to do it , and later during idle months between shows. // He hasn ' t had much time for home improvements lately , since the recent successful run of " Joe Egg " Off Broadway and its move next month to Broadway . In it , he and Stockard Channing play an unhappily married couple who stay together because of their severely spastic child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it might help people to stop thinking of him as the flamboyant circus impresario Phineas T. Barnum. // " I ' m in my 33d year as a pro , " he said , " and I ' ve only done three musical comedies . Yet , because of ' Barnum , ' I ' m thought of as a musical comedy actor. " // Mr. Dale , 49 , who has four grown children living in England from a previous marriage , met his present wife one day when he walked into her Manhattan gallery. // " He was obviously attracted to the things I loved , " Mrs. Dale said. // " I ' d have been attracted to her if she had been working in Woolworth ' s , " her husband replied // He said the two have become so used to each other ' s tastes since their marriage " that I know if I don ' t like something , she won ' t , and I have absolute confidence that I can buy something and she will like it. " // Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , sometimes I say , ' We don ' t need any more majolica plates , ' " Mr. Dale said. // " But then you ' re the first one who will go out and buy some more , " his wife added with a smile. // //
