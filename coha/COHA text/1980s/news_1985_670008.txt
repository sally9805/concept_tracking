Jewish tradition teaches that when all other avenues are closed , the gates of song are always open to God ' s ear . That is one reason cantorial music has won so warm a place in the hearts of the Jewish people , and why Nat Hentoff ' s piece ( Arts page , Sept. 24 ) on the great chazzanim of the early 20th century touched so sentimental a chord . Those were indeed thrilling voices and glorious advocates of their congregations before the Almighty . But one comes away with the feeling that great cantors have had their day , never to return , " because the ways of life that created them are , as with black classic blues singers , disappearing . " I can not speak for the blues , but chazzanut  --  the art of the cantor  --  is alive and well . There are 400 of us in the Cantors Assembly serving Conservative synagogues in the U.S. and Canada . Many more are being trained in the Cantors Institute ( Conservative ) and School of Sacred Music ( Reform ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving scores of congregations . The style of today ' s cantors varies widely , but as long as young people continue to choose to devote their lives to serving as cantors , chazzanut will continue to comfort and to inspire . Cantor Samuel Rosenbaum Executive Vice President Cantors Assembly Jewish Theological Seminary New York  --  - When jazz-critic Hentoff feels attracted to Hazzanim and their lore he has good reason . Hazzanut and jazz are forms of stylized folklore . I just wish to rectify a few errors made by the enthusiastic critic . On Yom Kippur no hazzan wears a black robe or skullcap ; he is in white from head to foot ; in fact , he wears his own shroud . There is no " first chorus " in the Kol Nidre , and it is not a prayer , but a legalistic formula hotly debated by rabbis . Yossele Rosenblatt was certainly a worthy hazzan , but Mr. Hentoff is mistaken that he did not seek secular laurels . He gave a " Schubert-Lieder-Abend " in Hamburg which turned out a complete flop .

It was and is the aim of the school to set a straight course against the chaotic bastardization of our genuine musical tradition , for which some of the hazzanim adored by Mr. Hentoff were certainly co-responsible . I can well understand that many ladies yearn for the voices of good hazzanim , as girls adored good tenors , and even Mr. Frank Sinatra . The answer to this was given by Freud in " Totem and Tabu . " As for Reform hazzanut , I was once its helmsman ( never its captain ! ) , but the good ship has long since changed its course , whether I like it or not . But it should not be forgotten that all hazzanut was ever a stylistic mixture of Jewish folklore , popular songs of the ghetto ' s environment , and , after the 17th century , many elements of the Italian opera . Prof. Eric Werner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall the long walks I took as a child with my father to Temple Beth El in Borough Park , Brooklyn , to hear the great Moshe Kussevitsky . My father , an Orthodox Jew whose piety seemed only intensified by the tragedies of the Holocaust , would have walked half a day to hear the impassioned strains , so familiar to him from the synagogues of his native Vilna . That early exposure to the sounds of Kussevitsky and other cantors like him was to influence me greatly as I grew , and I , like Mr. Hentoff , am often " mesmerized " by the recordings of the great cantors of yesteryear . Having been raised in a society relatively free of religious oppression , however , I am convinced that the cantorial techniques of Eastern Europe are not the only ways to inspire a congregation to pray . The sobbing sound may have its place in some of the liturgy today , but it mirrored hundreds of years of weeping over harsh realities . I and many others are part of a new generation of Jews who approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even incorporate older traditions and styles into our spiritual expression , we are excited at the prospect of creating new ways of showing our love and devotion to our people and to God . Furthermore , while there are clearly differences between the male and female voice , it is the intention of the individual leading a congregation which may or may not allow for the opening of the soul to prayer . The cantor ' s role is not to enhance him or herself while pleading with God on behalf of a congregation , but rather to glorify the sacred prayers . Although the woman quoted by Mr. Hentoff was " disappointed " after hearing a female cantor , generalizations ought not be made on one experience . The familiar is difficult to give up , but the psalmist wrote , " Sing a new song to the Lord . " I urge Mr. Hentoff to share in the worship of cantors , both men and women , who are singing a new song to the Lord , and I believe that the heavens do rejoice , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Temple Sinai Roslyn Heights , N.Y.
