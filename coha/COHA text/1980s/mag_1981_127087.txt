They 're blaming Europe , Swiss-cheese goalies and coaches . Everybody is in a dither over the fact that the scoring in NHL games is assuming NBA proportions . Take last Saturday night : Boston 10 , Quebec 1 ; Toronto 9 , Los Angeles 4 ; Pittsburgh 7 , Philadelphia 2 . On Sunday it was Chicago 10 , Calgary 4. // Nine or more goals were scored in 68 of the first 154 games this season . There have been no 1-0 or 2-0 games and only five shutouts . All but three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . // Three weeks ago the Flyers faced Montreal ; both teams were undefeated at the time . In the days when Bernie Parent and Ken Dryden were the goalies , these clubs played classic close-to-the-vest hockey . Not this time . The game was an 11-2 blowout for the Canadiens . Six nights later in Quebec , Montreal was up 4-1 after one period . Once upon a time a three-goal lead was as safe as a certificate of deposit . No longer . Quebec cranked up and won 5-4. // " It used to be you 'd get three or four goals and you were a cinch to win , " says Pittsburgh General Manager Baz Bastien . " Now you can score five , and there 's a good chance you 'll lose . " The statistics support his observation . The beginnings of the trend were evident last season . Montreal , which won the Vezina Trophy for giving up the fewest goals ( 232 ) , was scored on 28 times more than any previous Vezina winner had been . In 1953-54 the six NHL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 4.8 a game . Last year the league 's 21 clubs averaged 7.7 goals , the highest since the NHL introduced the center red line in 1943 . And so far this season , the average has jumped to 8.1 . Contrary to popular assumption , the increase can not be attributed to more shots on goal . In fact , they have remained fairly constant over the last two decades ( see chart , page 83 ) . // The ones suffering the most are , of course , the goalies . Look at what has happened to Chicago 's Tony Esposito . In 1970-71 , Espo yielded 1.76 goals a game . Last year he gave up 3.75 . So far this season , souped-up rival attacks have burned him for 5.37 goals a game . " Low averages are getting to be impossible , " says Esposito . " Today you can go through a whole season without a shutout . " In 1969-70 Esposito had a league-high 15 shutouts in 63 games . In 1979-80 he led the league with six . Last year he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is n't just the powerhouses that are running up scores , either . Against Calgary two weeks ago , Detroit got a dozen goals . That 's more than the Red Wings had scored in a game since 1944 . To prove that barrage was no fluke , last week the Red Wings scored 10 goals against the Kings . Philadelphia has given up 42 goals in its last six games , and Edmonton already has scored 81 goals in 15 games . Last year the Oilers did n't score their 81st goal until Nov. 28 . Two Oilers , Paul Coffey ( 21 points ) and Risto Siltanen ( 19 ) , are among the league 's top scorers . And they 're defensemen. // " Fans like to see 6-5 games more than 1-0 games , " says Edmonton 's Wayne Gretzky , who has 15 goals and 14 assists and is three games ahead of his record-setting scoring pace of last season . " I know we prefer them , too . If we can get into a basketball game , we love it . " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the roof is that today 's players are trigger-happy . They are the biggest , fastest and most accomplished skaters the NHL has ever seen . And just about every one of them is a shooter . " In my time you could cheat a little , " says former Black Hawk Goaltender Glenn Hall . " You 'd say , ' The shot is going to come from there because that 's where the goal-scorer is . ' Now they 're all goal-scorers. " // What has been happening , says Chicago Coach Keith Magnuson , is simple enough : " In junior hockey a young player concentrates on offense because he knows that the more he scores , the higher he 'll be drafted . " Well before he reaches the NHL , a player knows that scorers earn the biggest bucks . Also , since expansion in 1979-80 and the lowering of the minimum draft age to 18 in 1978 , the NHL has been overrun with young players . The average age is 25.3 , the lowest in history . What these youngsters do best is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely smarter , " says Montreal Goalie Rick Wamsley . " They do n't waste time with the puck . They 've seen the success that Bossy has had with the Islanders , and he does n't look before he shoots . A puck hits his stick and he lets fly . The goaltender has no time to get set . " // It 's tempting to blame the scoring explosion on poor goaltending . While the quality of NHL goaltending is at a ridiculously low level , these beleaguered guardians all too often are left to fend for themselves . The era of the defensive defenseman  --  someone who hung tough to protect his goalie  --  is long gone . " Defense does n't matter anymore , " says Frank Mahovlich , the former Maple Leaf , Red Wing and Canadien marksman , " not only to defensemen , but to forwards as well . Forwards do n't come back to help out often enough , so there are more scoring chances and therefore more goals . Today everyone goes for goals . We did in my day , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job now . " // Says former Boston Coach Don Cherry , " There 's no contact anywhere in the game this year . When was the last time a team drafted a checker ? " According to St. Louis Center Mike Zuke , " Probably the hardest commodity to find in hockey is a defensive defenseman . Agents , for young players especially , ca n't sell their clients on the intangibles of defense ; they ca n't show statistics on that . " // Today 's young defensemen are products of what one NHL coach calls " the Bobby Orr baby boom . " Orr revolutionized the concept of playing defense . He controlled play , handled the puck , shot and scored . " The best defensemen today are offensive defensemen , " says Toronto G.M. Punch Imlach . " Orr 's responsible for that . Everyone is trying to play the way he did . Naturally , they can't. " // What 's more , no longer do NHL coaches rely chiefly on one line to light up the scoreboard . Most teams now have two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defensemen as well as forwards , coaches have quit trying to protect leads . A few years ago teams would get one or two goals ahead and play keep-away . Toronto won Stanley Cups in 1962 , ' 63 and ' 64 by making one goal look as big as 10 ; old opponents must still bear the marks left by the Leafs ' barbed-wire defense . But now , a lead is merely a spark for piling on more goals . // Moreover , coaching  --  read teaching  --  is a lost art in North America , except on the college level . In the Soviet Union , teams practice three times as often as they play . In the NHL , however , with an 80-game , six-month schedule , teams typically play three games in a week while practicing only twice . // Still another factor in the scoring surge has been the replacement of oversized , immobile goons with small , quick players who can score . This swing toward speedy skaters is largely the result of the European influence on the NHL . In 1975-76 there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 54. // " Because of the larger ice surface in Europe , a player has to skate well to be a star over there , " says Montreal Managing Director Irving Grundman . " But it 's well known that the Europeans are n't as strong defensively , especially in their own zone , as NHL players are . " Yet , Europeans have largely taken the place of enforcers who could n't score . Time was a club had only a few players who got 20 goals in a season . Last year St. Louis had 10 with 20 or more . // As the pucks fly , it 's easy to see that there is also more individualism out there than ever before . Edmonton Coach Glen Sather tells Gretzky he does n't care if he checks . Montreal 's Mark Napier says , " It takes more of a team effort to win by a shutout than to win in a shootout. " // And such team efforts are becoming increasingly rare . Whether the scoring explosion is good for the sport is another matter . Hockey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Wings ' Coach Wayne Maxner , who says , " People came to see Bobby Hull shoot the puck . They did n't come to see him check . " // Perhaps , but people do n't go to games to see cheap goals and one-way hockey . As Ed Van Impe , a former defensive defenseman for the Flyers , points out , " For the life of me , I ca n't understand why the Europeans should dictate the style of play in the NHL . Hockey is very entertaining over in Europe , but it 's like the Ice Capades. "
