 | Crime and terrorism have propelled U.S. companies into a costly drive to protect their executives from violence at home and overseas . Efforts to cope range from beefing up bodyguard services to the use of space-age alarm systems and commando-style defense training . Sales of fashion-coordinated bulletproof vests are reported on the rise , and merchants are bringing out new lines of James Bond-type gear . Prices start at a few hundred dollars for " bionic briefcases " loaded with defensive gadgetry and run to $100,000 and up for armored supercars equipped to smash roadblocks and spew oil and nails in the paths of pursuers . Within the United States , security experts say , the new striving for protection stems mainly from general perceptions that violent crime is on the rise and that business executives and their families are especially tempting targets for kidnappers , extortionists and extremists . A recent survey of top executives , for instance , found that fear of crime far outstrips the actual incidence of atArmored cars with gun ports are available to executives who fear kidnapping . tacks upon business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been occasional well-publicized attacks and threats against executives . These range from hit lists confiscated from such domestic terror groups as the Symbionese Liberation Army to the 1979 kidnap-murder of Cleveland executive Julius Kravitz and the brief abduction in late June of the daughter of Hollywood producer Mel Simon . The late-May murder of Telex Corporation Chairman Roger Wheeler in Tulsa also has underscored growing concerns for executive safety . Around the world . Overseas terrorism , too , has fueled the executive-protection boom ? with statistical evidence to back up fears for the safety of Americans who work or travel abroad on business . Attacks aimed at business targets now account for nearly one third of all terrorist incidents worldwide . There are no official figures on how much is being spent on protective efforts in the U.S. , but it is estimated that the tab runs to tens of millions of dollars a year . Among the cocoonlike measures taken by one East Coast corporation : Every top executive rides to and from work in a company car driven by an armed , security-trained chauffeur . Indoors , senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operated by guards . Company officials and secretaries have desk-mounted silent-alarm buttons . At night , pressure-sensitive switches under the carpets warn of intruders . All mail to executives goes first through a bomb-detection device . One expert works full time investigating letters from cranks . Public appearances by senior personnel draw advance surveillance . " If an executive is giving a speech at a university , for instance , we might check the dormitory bulletin boards to see who is calling for action against what , " says a security man . On the West Coast , a pharmaceutical house , which received a kidnap threat , has " bugged " its main offices and the homes of its top managers . The microphones , which detect suspicious sounds such as forced entries , are linked by leased phone lines to a central monitoring console manned 24 hours a day . Similar home and personal alarm sys- tems figure into corporate programs coast to coast . Prices run from $2,000 to $20,000 , plus monitoring fees . On a simpler scale , companies are urging key executives and their families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troublemakers . Among the rules : Avoid the society columns . Replace customized license plates . Use unlisted phone numbers . Shun displays of affluence . " We 're all trying to blend in , to be nondescript , " says the security director of a West Coast conglomerate . " We 're past the prestige era when my car had to be longer than yours . " Another point stressed by security directors : Change behavior patterns that help an assailant anticipate your next move . Vary routes of travel around town . Come and go at different times . To back up all these precautions , many companies are covering vulnerable executives with ransom insurance , a field described by one West Coast expert as " big business and very hushhush . " Insurance firms will cancel any such policy if a holder discloses it . Costly coverage . Companies now carry ransom policies worth up to 10 million dollars ? at premiums of about $20,000 for three years ' coverage ? according to the chief of security at a Chicago bank . Among those most in need of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; business people in politically controversial fields , such as oil and nuclear power ; officers of banks and other lending institutions ? " someone who can unlock the vault and get in at 3 a.m. past security . " Fear of kidnapping has also led to creation of the company crisis-management team . " It would determine who would be the spokesman and how the company could get 15 million dollars in the middle of the night , " says Los Angeles security consultant Tom Reddin . Bodyguards are part of the picture , too . Although experts disagree on their value in a shooting situation , the consensus is that a sophisticated new breed is replacing the muscleman of old . Notes New York-based consultant Ken Delahunt : " Today , the security guy has to be well trained in understanding the psychology of the guy he 's protecting the executive from . " In Denver , A. Dale Wunderlich , a former Secret Service agent , says that requests from companies for protective details have jumped more than 100 percent in a year . Security Escort Services of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past year to more than 30 corporations . Also cropping up are private consulting services , often run by retired federal agents and policemen who offer training courses for corporate security officers and executives themselves . An example is MVM International Security , formed two years ago by former Secret Service man Charles Vance and two other former presidential bodyguards . Conducted at a 360-acre camp near Summit Point , W.Va. , the course of instruction ranges from antiterrorist tactics to emergency first-aid training . Final examination is a 6-hour exercise in which Vance 's men try to ambush someone protected by the students , using blank ammunition and live bombs exploded just out of range . The cost : $3,300 for a six-day course . Another busy field is the training of corporate chauffeurs in daredevil-driving techniques , such as the J-turns and controlled drifts that can break roadblocks and foil highway ambushes . Since 1973 , when Bob Bondurant established his school north of San Francisco , more than 100 drivers for oil , steel and other corporations have taken the course , which now costs $1,295 . Taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field within the steadily expanding U.S. security industry ? an industry that , over all , is expected to grow from sales of 6.5 billion dollars in 1978 to 23 billion by 1990 , according to Predicasts , a Cleveland-based market-research firm . Nonetheless , many businessmen remain skeptical about the need for all these measures and balk at meddlesome protective efforts . " You get a lot of these executives who have a macho attitude and say they 're not afraid of anything , " says Pennsylvania-based security expert Thomas G. Forsyth . Adds a Houston executive : " We 've never had any trouble , so we do n't worry about it . If somebody decides to kidnap one of our top men , we undoubtedly will try to lock the barn door after the theft . " Weak points . The result , security specialists complain , is that protection plans may be thwarted from inside . Executives refuse to provide the fingerprints and blood and hair samples that company investigators like to have on file . Employes neglect to activate homealarm systems , rendering them useless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and careless attitudes are foolhardy for executives in today 's violent world . Sums up one Californiabased security expert : " The threat to executive safety is real and will increase . Any major corporation that thinks it can avoid it during the 1980s is deceiving itself . " For Americans Working Overseas , Life Is Even Riskier Corporations and corporate employes are now the No. 1 target of terrorism abroad . In 1980 , international terrorists aimed 31 percent of their attacks at businesses or business people , according to Risks International , an Alexandria , Va. , research firm . " Thus , business installations and personnel are still the largest single category attacked by terrorist groups worldwide ? a position held by business since late 1979 , " the firm concludes in a situation report . Latin America is ranked as by far the most dangerous area , with Western Europe a distant second . Seven U.S. business employes were reported kidnapped by foreign extremists last year , and four others were reported killed . This year , the toll of violence has increased , with 21 employes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March alone . To combat the threat to executives on foreign assignment , U.S. corporations are taking many of the same precautions that they employ at home : Increased building security , defensive training courses for executives , use of bodyguards . Many also monitor danger-trend information compiled by the U.S. government and private consultants . Levi Strauss &; Company of San Francisco , for instance , gives countries low to high-risk ratings and bars employes from visiting the worst areas . Among those listed as off limits : El Salvador , Lebanon . Some executives bound for overseas assignments make exotic safety preparations . For example , a West Coast oil-company representative graduated from an evasive-driving course and left for Central America the next day with a $65,000 armorplated limousine . Others take a simpler approach . " When I go to South America , I put all my gold pieces away , anything that shines on my finger , wrist or neck , " says a Florida banking executive . " I mix with the people and try not to wear fancy clothes or fancy shoes ? nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
