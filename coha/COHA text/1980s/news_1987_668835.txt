Recently I refinanced the mortgage on my home . I shopped among many lenders and finally narrowed the choice down to the two best . Each sent out an independent fee appraiser to evaluate my house . Using the same information about the house , they came to different opinions of market value , which were exactly $50 , 000 apart . The appraiser with the higher valuation was using recent sales prices of similar neighborhood homes . But the appraiser with the lower estimated value was living in the past , relying on sales data that was up to six months old . In a rising market , appraisers who use old selling prices as comparables quickly find they don ' t get appraisal assignments from lenders . Since I decided I best liked the mortgage loan terms of the lender whose appraiser estimated the lower market value , a reappraisal was requested . The same appraiser , using more current data , increased the appraised value of my home by $35 , 000  --  high enough to get the loan I wanted . The classic definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a property will change ownership between a willing buyer and a willing seller , neither being under pressure to buy or sell . But how can two appraisals on the same house , made within the same week , be $50 , 000 apart ? The reason is that appraisal is an art , not a science . The causes of widely differing appraisals on the same property include ( 1 ) one or both appraisers might lack adequate training and experience , or be incompetent , ( 2 ) perhaps one lender instructed the appraiser to appraise low at a " quick sale " valuation whereas the other lender , eager to make the loan , requested a generous appraisal , and ( 3 ) one appraiser had better access to more recent comparable sales price information . Until a property sale takes place , nobody can be 100 percent certain of a property ' s exact market value . But appraisals are needed for many purposes not involving sales  --  such as mortgage refinancing , real estate tax assessments , divorce settlements and inheritance tax appraisals . To further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or license requirements . Most states do not license appraisers . But at least six major appraisal societies attempt to set minimal standards for their members . However , most appraisers have only had quick appraisal courses and do not belong to any appraisal organization . Since virtually anyone can call himself an appraiser , the industry is plagued by disorganization and lack of training quality standards or license exams . Many mortgage lenders set their own criteria for hiring appraisers , such as requiring errors and omissions insurance or selecting large appraisal firms . One of these is Record Data Inc. , a subsidiary of the TRW Corp . Given the disorganization of the appraisal industry , property owners , lenders , real estate agents and others are often frustrated when an appraisal is required . While most appraisers do their best to provide an accurate appraisal , the person requesting the appraisal can help assure a fair and accurate appraisal . Although a few appraisers with big egos resent being given information on recent sales of nearby comparable properties , most welcome the assistance . If a property sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appraiser to be certain the appraiser gets accurate measurements and information about the house . The best real estate agents hand the appraiser written details of comparable nearby home sales to be certain that the appraiser has the latest sales information including :  --  Recent sales prices , sizes and addresses of similar nearby homes and , if available , recent prices of any neighborhood vacant lot sales with square footage.  --  Diagram of the house with room sizes and total square footage calculated ( so the appraiser can double-check measurements ) .  --  Legal description and assessor ' s parcel number.  --  Amount of the requested loan and sales price of the home . After the appraiser gathers all the required information , it is compiled , usually on a VA/FHA/Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac-approved form . Most lenders require appraisers to take photos of the property as well as of the comparable properties used in the appraisal . Appraisers primarily use three appraisal methods :  --  Replacement cost.  --  Income capitalization.  --  Market data . The replacement cost method is given most weight for newer properties , whereas the income capitalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices . The market data or comparable sales technique is given most weight for homes . Using the market data approach , at least three nearby comparable homes are compared on the appraisal form with the subject property . Features and deficiencies of each home are noted , such as room count and size , design , quality , age , appearance , lot size , finance terms and sales price per square foot . After compiling this information and adding or subtracting value for each property ' s pros and cons , the appraiser arrives at an estimated market value of the subject property . Obviously , there are many sources of errors on an appraisal report . When the property owner pays for the appraisal , a copy should be given to the owner as there is no valid reason to hide the appraiser ' s work from the person who pays for it . When the mystery of the appraisal process is removed and the appraisal industry upgrades its standards by better education and experience standards , the quality and accuracy of appraisals should improve.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
