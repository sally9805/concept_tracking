Officials said they were still working out the final language of the deal and warned that such complex transactions could break down at the last minute . The investment group , MacAndrews &; Forbes Holding Inc. , is headed by Ronald O. Perelman , the financier and takeover specialist who is the head of Revlon Inc. , the cosmetics company. // The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said that , in return for the $5 billion in assistance , MacAndrews &; Forbes would contribute $315 million of its own funds to bolster the five institutions , which have assets of $12. 2 billion . <> <> ' Amazed by the Number ' // The size of the aid plan stunned analysts of the savings and loan industry . " I am amazed by the number , " said Bert Ely , a financial consultant based in Alexandria , Va . " That is so much more than I thought it would be . But it ' s just further confirmation that the losses are of a far greater magnitude in Texas than the bank board has ever been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the responsibility for some of the most troubled Texas institutions from the Government . They include the First Texas Savings Association , with $3. 2 billion in assets ; the Gibraltar Savings Association of Houston , with $6. 3 billion ; the Home Savings and Loan Associaton of Houston , with $568 million ; the Killeen Savings and Loan Association of Killeen , with $256 million , and the Montfort Federal Savings and Loan Association of Dallas , with $1. 8 billion . <> <> Chief Sued by Bank Board // Montfort is the former Venon Savings and Loan Association of Dallas , which was one of the most notorious risk-taking savings and loan associations that the bank board has dealt with . When it was taken over by the agency earlier this year , bank board officials found that 96 percent of its loans were delinquent or nonperforming . Subsequently , the agency sued Vernon ' s chief , Don R. Dixon. // The planned transaction would dwarf a series of billion-dollar bailouts arranged by the bank board in recent months of troubled savings and loan associations in Texas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that involved in the sale of the nation ' s largest insolvent savings and loan association , the American Savings and Loan Association of Stockton , Calif. , with $30 billion in assets , to the Robert M. Bass Group . In that deal , which is to be announced soon , the bank board has said it would inject as much as $2 billion in Federal aid. // The only transaction that appears to be larger involved takeovers by the bank board of the Sunbelt Savings Association of Texas and seven other institutions with assets of almost $7 billion last August . Under that transaction , in which the agency merged the eight institutions into one , officials estimated the ultimate cost would be $5. 5 billion. // Like the Sunbelt deal , the proposed Perelman transaction for the five savings associations graphically illustrates just how troubled many institutions are in Texas. // In addition to Mr. Perelman , others running the day-to-day operations of the two institutions would be Gerald J. Ford of Dallas , who heads the Ford Bank Group . Mr. Ford is also president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks with assets of $2 billion. // The Perelman deal is only one of a number of transactions that the bank board is seeking to complete before the start of 1989 , when the tax benefits of its aid will be cut in half . Since last August , the agency , which is the primary regulator of the nation ' s 3 , 000 savings and loan associations , has been seeking to find buyers for more than 500 insolvent institutions , whose total losses are estimated to range from $50 billion to $100 billion . <> <> Fund Technically Insolvent // At this point , the agency ' s insurance fund , the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation , is technically insolvent , with obligations exceeding its assets . And given the growing consensus that the cost of shutting down or selling troubled savings and loan associations will far exceed $50 billion , most analysts and regulators are predicting that Congress will have to approve the largest taxpayer bailout on record. // Currently , the Treasury Department is rushing to complete its study of the savings and loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle the problem by the middle of January . The Treasury has found that the cost of cleaning up the industry will be in the range of $75 billion to $85 billion , and if interest rates increase by one percentage point , the costs will rise by another $15 billion. // In President Reagan ' s last budget , the Administration has agreed for the first time to provide taxpayer money to cover the operating losses of the insurance corporation in the fiscal year that begins in October . <> <> Bidding Has Been Intense // The bidding for First Texas and Gibraltar had been intense . Among other bidders interested was the Ford Motor Company , through its First Nationwide Bank subsidiary . But bank board official said that the Perelman offer was less costly to the Government. // One of the main problems for a public company like Ford with such a transaction was that the bank board insists on issuing a large insurance corporation promissory note as part of the assistance package , since its cash levels are small by comparison. // Publicly traded companies tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet to conclude that F.S.L.I.C. notes carry the full faith and credit of the Government , and have warned that they might have to give a qualified auditing report if a company carries large amounts of these obligations . <> <> Rush Raising Questions // But the rush to complete deals before the start of 1989 is raising some questions among members of Congress and industry experts . Many of the bank board transactions to date have been criticized as essentially Government giveaways , with huge amounts of assistance going out and precious little new capital coming in from the private sector. // Analysts have said that investors , with little or none of their own capital at stake , are more inclined to take chances with their newly acquired institutions , leaving the Government as the party at risk. // Moreover , many of the deals permit the acquiring institutions to use the net operating losses of the ailing savings and loan associations they acquire , essentially reducing their future tax burden . Some have argued that this in effect is an indirect taxpayer bailout , that the magnitude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown. // Bank board officials bristle at such suggestions , saying they have turned down a number of deals in recent weeks and that tax considerations are only one factor in deciding to close a deal . But others disagree . <> <> ' Very , Very Troubling ' // " This rush to do deals , especially since we don ' t really know what the deals are is very , very troubling , " said Representative Charles E. Schumer , Democrat of Brooklyn . " Congress has explicitly said that you can use some of the tax losses to get a sick institution off the ground , but if you are passing the tax breaks up to a holding company then you better watch out . Congress will come down hard on that. " // Under the proposed agreement , the bank board said it would issue a promissory note from the insurance corporation of $2. 1 billion . The remaining $2. 9 billion in Federal aid will be issued in the form of guarantees against losses on loans , over a 10-year period. // These guarantees tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss coverage , " involved guarantees by the insurance corporation covering any losses on the book value of a loan when it is eventually sold . The other , called " yield maintenance agreements , " guarantees that any loss of interst income on loans will be made up by the agency. // The planned size of the transaction also raises questions about the extent of outstanding obligations the bank board currently has . With this deal and the American Savings transaction , analysts say the agency will have far more than $30 billion in outstanding obligations , including F.S.L.I.C. notes and guarantees. // They have predicted that the income to the insurance corporation from deposit insurance premiums , liquidations and other sources will fall far short of covering the continuing costs of these obligations. //
