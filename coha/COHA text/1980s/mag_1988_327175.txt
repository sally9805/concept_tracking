THE LETTERS OF JOHN CHEEVER <P> Edited by Benjamin Cheever <P> Simon &; Schuster ; 397 pages ; $19.95 <P> Throughout most of his career , John Cheever labored amid the general impression that he was , at best , a minor writer . After all , his specialty was short stories . Never mind that they were clear , sparkling and frequently unforgettable ; most of them appeared in The New Yorker and could be dismissed by the grim custodians of literary reputations as well-bred entertainments for the well-to-do . Doubts about his importance dwindled only toward the end of his life . His fourth novel , Falconer ( 1977 ) , won extensive critical and popular acclaim , and the publication of The Stories of John Cheever ( 1978 ) $ prompted general jubilation . <P> This upswing in Cheever 's respectability accelerated after his death in 1982 . Two books about him have since appeared : a memoir by his daughter Susan , Home Before Dark ( 1984 ) , and Scott Donaldson 's John Cheever : A Biography , published earlier this year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a compromise between the Cheever estate and a Midwestern publisher has been reached : a selection of the author 's uncollected stories will appear next spring . And Cheever 's private journals will surely be made public soon . All of this activity prompts a question . If Cheever 's early obscurity was unjustified , might not these posthumous publications be a compensatory case of too much too late ? <P> The Letters of John Cheever provides a quick , easy answer : no . The author believed , as he once wrote a friend , that " the common minutiae of life " are " the raw material of most good letters . " Cheever 's letters are crammed with everyday details , although such information does not shed much new light on his fiction , which was luminous enough to begin with . To learn more about Cheever is to take a refresher course in the pleasure of his company . He could toss off a letter that made even a motel remarkable : " The furniture was of no discernible period or inspiration and I think if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insane . " Cheever 's correspondence , as selected , edited and annotated by his son Benjamin , amounts to an entirely new story  --  long , engrossing and recounted with characteristic grace . <P> Although he was a faithful letter writer , Cheever assumed that his pen pals would destroy his missives as casually as he did theirs . He was thus startled in 1959 to hear from author Josephine Herbst that she had been saving his mail . " Yesterday 's roses , " he wrote back , playfully dismissing her collection of his work , " yesterday 's kisses , yesteryear 's snows . " Cheever 's unselfconscious approach allowed his imagination and love of language free play . The supposedly ephemeral results of this process were , paradoxically , often memorable . Here is a 1946 description of his surroundings during a vacation in New Hampshire : " The pastures are stony , the mountains are leonine , the natives are taciturn and venal , the sunsets are red , and in the early evenings you can hear , from the shores of the lake , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gibberish song about what a wonderful time they 're having at Camp Wonk-a-tonk.
