On Aug. 30 , 1905 , his first day in the majors , the centerfielder walked , then took off for second base . Eighty years later , players are still trying to catch Ty Cobb . Maury Wills first did it in 1962 when he ran by the old mark of 96 stolen bases in a season . Now Pete Rose , barring calamity , will exceed the hallowed record of 4,191 hits . But , like Wills , he will surpass only the man , not the icon . <P> Even in his playing years Cobb assumed a mythic stature . The garrulous Casey Stengel summed up his contemporary in a lone sentence : " It was like he was superhuman . " Others would say subhuman . On his most courteous afternoons , Cobb slid in , spikes high and sharpened to maim . He wrangled with teammates , two wives , five children and innumerable ticket holders . When a New York fan taunted him , Cobb climbed into the stands and stomped the offender . It was later pointed out that the stompee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other . Cobb replied tenderly , " I do n't care if he has no feet . " <P> For 33 years it was difficult to decide whether the man they called the Georgia Peach belonged on the base paths or with the sociopaths . Yet there is no one who more clearly deserved a place in the Hall of Fame , and he was the first player voted in at the 1936 start . The battle of self-destruction and will began back in rural Georgia , when the teenage hunter accidentally shot himself with a .22 rifle . The bullet lodged in the vicinity of his clavicle and remained there for the rest of his life . Tyrus Raymond Cobb 's father , W.H. , a school commissioner , thought of his son as a potential doctor or lawyer . As Professor Cobb saw it , baseball players were drunken , wenching , low-salaried louts . He relented when Ty refused to go to college , but the old man warned him , " Do n't come home a failure . " <P> Cobb was to come home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father saw none of those achievements . W.H. was shotgunned twice on the evening of Aug. 8 , 1905 . His wife pulled the trigger . She had mistaken him , she claimed , for an intruder . Three weeks later , amid rumors about his parents ' marital squabbles , infidelity and murder , the red-haired 18-year-old fought his way into the Detroit Tigers ' lineup . But he saw no reason to rejoice . " I only thought , " he recalled , " father wo n't know it . " <P> Perhaps to prove himself to a ghost , perhaps because of the hazing his teammates gave him , the rookie became an animal . " I was just a mild-mannered Sunday-school boy , " Cobb liked to reminisce 40 years later . " But those old-timers turned me into a snarling wild-cat . " They snubbed him , sawed his bats in half , locked him out of hotel rooms . He responded with his mouth , his fists and his average . In Cobb 's first full year he hit .320 , and that was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spitball he led the league in hitting a dozen seasons , and went over .400 three times . His lifetime batting average was .367 . No one has ever equaled his bat control : in 1926 , when he hit .339 , he struck out twice .
