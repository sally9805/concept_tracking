" In this part of the world , Jews and Arabs mil live together forever " <P> Since he became Prime Minister of Israel five months ago , Yitzhak Shamir has struggled with the problems left behind by his predecessor , Menachem Begin . In the process , his confidence has grown and he has proved to be a smooth , pragmatic leader . Shamir has cut government spending to try to cool off Israel 's dangerously fevered economy . He has withdrawn Israel 's occupation force in western Lebanon to the Awali River . Most important , he has mended his country 's severely strained ties with the U.S. Now Shamir faces another test : early elections and a campaign that will undoubtedly be as fierce as any in Israel 's history . The Prime Minister had just ended a hectic meeting on fixing the election date ( July 23 ) when he received Time Inc . Editor in Chief Henry Grunwald , TIME Managing Editor Ray Cave and Chief of Correspondents Richard Duncan in his comfortable but modest Jerusalem office . Though he looked weary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he responded in English to his visitors ' questions . Excerpts from the interview : <P> Q. Do you expect to win the elections ? <P> A. Of course . Our weakness is our system of coalitions , with its small parties . Whoever wins needs the support of the small groups , and these groups do not have national responsibility . In some cases , one or two votes can have a tremendous effect on the fate of the government . We have to change this system . <P> Q. What will the main issues be ? <P> A. The economy will be one of the most important issues . But we will have other issues : Lebanon , relations with our neighbors , the so-called territories of Samaria and Judea the West Bank , and Gaza . In all the campaigns in the past we had to face the same issues , except Lebanon . <P> Q. What are the conditions under which you would withdraw troops from Lebanon ? <P> A. We have one condition : sufficient security arrangements on our northern frontier . It will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factions on the spot . <P> Q. Five years after Camp David , how do you assess the region generally ? <P> A. The explosion of King Hussein who bitterly attacked U.S. policy three weeks ago was a bit surprising . After all , we have always expressed our readiness to talk with him openly or , if he prefers , not openly . We believe that we have many common interests and that it is high time to discuss them . Nobody can guarantee that discussions will be fruitful in the first phases , but we have to start . Besides the territorial issues , which are very complicated from the point of view of King Hussein , there are many other common issues needing agreed-upon solutions . Many economic issues . We have the same resources of water . In this part of the world water is very precious , very important . We have a common issue in the Dead Sea , which is one of the greatest treasures of our country and of Jordan . We share problems of security . As you begin to discuss these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate for solving the more thorny issues . <P> Q. When you speak of the thornier issues , we assume that you refer to the ultimate disposition of what we call the West Bank . Do n't you feel that your settlement policy makes a better climate more difficult ?
