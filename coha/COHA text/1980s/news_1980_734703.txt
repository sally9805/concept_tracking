txt Noise is finally getting some attention . Noise , of course , has always been a problem in urban civilizations ( Caesar banned chariot riding at night ) . But what is hard to explain today are the willful efforts to augment noise . It is as if the noise pollution from industry , airplanes , cars and refrigerators was not enough . Modern man must also begin his day with radio noise to wake him up , have a car radio or tape deck to carry him to work , continue with Muzak in the elevatoi and office and " on hold " on the telephone . relax by the jukebox at the bar and conclude his day with televised newzack . Those who can not sleep in the silence that descends when the TV is shut off now resort to machines which produce something called " white noise . " TV , radio , stereo , etc. can be the vehicles for great drama , beautiful can or even salvific words . But who can claim that for the vast majority of people these devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not listened to ; they are simply heard . Constant noise is not even noticed . It is like the air we breathe , made obvious to us only by its absence . Silence , in this way , has become like a vacuum which modern man abhors . He fears he will implode in it . * * * Silence is no longer seen as normal or as good in itself . It is understood only as an absence , a lack of noise . Before noise ( B.N. ) there were sounds , distinguishable from noise , because sounds came out of silence . Silence was the background for sounds . City dwellers , awash in constant noise , become very nervous in the country because the sounds of the country  --  from crickets , birds and animals  --  are made against the background of silence . There is also less talk in the country , not because people are slower there , but because words are spoken out of the silence . To interrupt the silence one must have something to say . Words are not part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where one can say anything in order not to stop talking . Silence in the city is always interpreted as awkwardness . It is embarrassing not to be talking , not to be part of the noise . There seems to be a fear that if the noise stops , so will everything else . The city will collapse in the silence . This is why parks are no longer a refuge of silence in the city . People seem to be afraid to go to the park without their radios or portable home entertainment centers . I have recently observed joggers who flee the silence by wearing radio head sets as they run . Before the days of widespread TV , a Swiss thinker , Max Picard , offered the novel notion that people play the radio to make sure they are still really there . Radio noise reassures modern man that he exists . This proposition neatly reverses the old conundrum : If a tree falls in a forest , does it make a sound if there is no one there to hear it ? This question presumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hearing it . The modern formulation of this question , a la Picard , would reverse these presumptions and have modern man asking : If there is no noise , do I really exist ? If there is no noise , how do I know I am really here ? * * * The reader may think that this is pushing a point too far . The point , of course , is that modern man has substituted the ersatz reality of the media for reality itself , that he is left in a sort of existential crisis ' without the media . But I recall a recent survey of the effects of TV which concluded that people who live in neighborhoods which have been televised feel a lower level of anxiety than those who do not . The reason is that , having seen their neighborhoods on TV , these people feel a surer sense of their neighborhoods ' existence . Solitude and silence are the crucibles of serious thought . To flee them is to flee the necessary conditions for that examination of one 's life that makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that peace that can only come from the orientation of one 's life to the ultimate realities , the realities that can only intrude upon one when one is still and quiet and open to them . I am often told that people turn on the radio and TV because they are lonely . Noise is used as tonic for loneliness . It is an aural busyness which prevents reflection . It is an acoustic drug . But loneliness is a longing for something which should not be drowned in noise . If one quietly searches one 's loneliness , one can begin to ask why one is lonely and for what ? Loneliness lets us know that we really have nothing adequate to our deepest longings ? not in our friends , not in our family , nor in our worldly goods or pleasures . In what then or in whom are we to find the object of our deepest desire ? This is perhaps the most important question that can be asked , and it can only be answered in silence .
