In the same cluttered office in which he created such children ' s classics as " The Cat in the Hat " and " How the Grinch Stole Christmas , " Theodor Seuss Geisel is putting the finishing touches on his first book for adults in almost 50 years . " It ' s an adult book in a child ' s format , " Geisel said . It will include the same type of comical illustrations and verse that have delighted young readers for decades . Known to millions by his pen name , Dr. Seuss , the 81-year-old Geisel said he works as hard now as ever . His only thought of retirement is when he encounters writer ' s block . " But then I wonder what I ' d do and give up ( the thought ) , " he said . Geisel , a 35-year resident of this beach town north of San Diego , lives and works in a converted observation tower overlooking the Pacific Ocean . His work day starts at 9 a. m . " I can sleep later than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bed , " he said , adding that he sits at the drawing board for the rest of the day " whether anything happens or not . " The 50 illustrations and the words that go with the new book , to be published by Random House , are tacked in sequence on his office wall , an editing trick Geisel learned in his highly successful Hollywood days . He won Academy Awards for documentary films in 1946 for " Hitler Lives " and again in 1947 for " Design for Death , " a history of the Japanese people . His third Oscar came in 1951 for the animated cartoon " Gerald McBoing-Boing . " " If you stick up the pictures and words on the wall , " Geisel said , " you can see the whole flow of the story . It ' s the best way to edit the material . " Geisel describes his latest book as a satire , but that ' s all he will say . " It would be silly for me to talk about it ; it hasn ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 versions of each story before settling on the finished product . He hopes to have the new book published March 2 , his 82d birthday . Geisel ' s most recent children ' s work , " The Butter Battle Book , " a parable about the nuclear arms race , was published on his 80th birthday and became a best seller . " What happened was my last book had an unexpectedly large adult audience , " Geisel said . " I suddenly realized I was thinking adultwise and I couldn ' t shake it off ; so I decided to write a book for adults this time . " Geisel has authored 44 children ' s books , which have sold a combined total of more than 100 million copies . The books have been published in 17 languages . The winner of a 1984 Pulitzer Prize for his contributions to children ' s literature , Geisel ' s first book , written for adults and published in 1937 , was a flop . " I wrote a turkey called ' The Seven Lady Godivas , ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Depression , and it cost $2 . But nobody had $2 . " Later that same year , he " sort of wandered into children ' s books , " publishing " . . . And to Think I Saw It on Mulberry Street . " That book was followed by scores of other tales , including " Horton Hatches the Egg , " " Green Eggs and Ham " and " Yertle the Turtle . " Geisel , who has never had children of his own , said he has tried to make reading fun for youngsters . " I think I can communicate with kids because I don ' t try to communicate with kids , " he said . " Ninety percent of the children ' s books patronize the child and say there ' s a difference between you and me , so you listen to me tell this story . " I , for some reason or another , don ' t do that . I treat the child as an equal. "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
