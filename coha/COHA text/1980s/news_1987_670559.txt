Three weeks after the 50-year-old oversize businessman was shot by an apparent contract killer in a Manhattan restaurant , a police official says the prime suspect remains an associate of the Gambino Mafia family and the likely motive , a dispute over loan shark debts. // But the more that is uncovered of the victim ' s past , the more the enigma of Irwin Schiff appears to grow. // What emerges is the contradictory picture of a lavish spender who called himself a financial consultant , lived in a $13 , 000-a-month East Side duplex penthouse , drove a $185 , 000 antique Stutz Bearcat and half-million-dollar " cigarette " speedboat , gambled away hundreds of thousands of dollars in Atlantic City , claimed ownership of hotels and casinos and clubs , and once listed his net worth as $20 million - all with no traceable sources of income or assets. // To his many friends , some of them celebrities , the 6-foot , 4-inch , 350-pound Mr. Schiff was " a teddy bear , " as one recalled him , a gentle , teetotaling bachelor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no expense to entertain others , foster their careers and comfort them in moments of personal grief. // // ' He Took Care of It ' // His boosters include Francesco Scavullo , the fashion photographer . " Whenever somebody was sick or in trouble or needed help , he took care of it , " said Mr. Scavullo . " When his brother had cancer he went all over the place trying to save him . But it wasn ' t just his brother , it could be anybody . " Two years ago , he said , Mr. Schiff donated $10 , 000 for a fashion show to benefit St. Joseph ' s Church in Greenwich Village. // " How I feel about this man could never be shattered , " Mr. Scavullo said , " no matter what comes out. " // But court records and other accounts obtained by The New York Times paint a darker portrait of a longtime confidence man and bad check artist who gypped old women and trusting partners , left a trail of unpaid debts and broken business contracts , and once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And although he told friends he was an owner of the deluxe Georgian Hotel on Lake George - where he raced a half-million-dollar speedboat - and a popular Manhattan disco , the China Club , among other properties , people there who described themselves as the actual owners disputed his claims. // There are other puzzling aspects too , suspicions of a confidential relationship with Government investigative agencies , stemming initially from a story told by Mr. Schiff himself , and bolstered by his ability to surmount repeated clashes with the law . Pieces in the Puzzle : Dodging His Creditors He successfully dodged a $127 , 230 bill from American Express and a $1 million judgment won by an ex-partner . In 1977 , he pleaded guilty to evading more than $52 , 000 in 1972 Federal income taxes , was fined $5 , 000 and given a five-year suspended jail sentence . But as recently as last May , records show that the Internal Revenue Service was seeking to attach $2 , 746 , 786 it claimed Mr. Schiff owed the Government for unpaid taxes and penalties - more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier prosecution. // Mr. Schiff ' s sister and brother-in-law , David and Sheila Cornstein , his closest remaining relatives , turned away numerous requests for information , as did other longtime friends and associates , including a singer and recording artist Mr. Schiff liked to introduce as his fiancee. // Others who were interviewed said they were at a loss to explain the fortune Mr. Schiff evidently had at his disposal . Even one of his accountants claimed to be mystified . How Much Money ? <> <> No Ready Answers // " I don ' t know where his money came from , " said Gary Kahn , Mr. Schiff ' s accountant through 1984 . While saying he was professionally barred from discussing the tax returns he prepared for his client , Mr. Kahn confirmed that large sums of money had moved through Mr. Schiff ' s accounts - although , he said , nothing like the $20 million net worth Mr. Schiff listed on a 1984 credit application with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. // " I never saw anything reflecting anything near that , " Mr. Kahn said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he had. " // Mr. Schiff was killed Aug. 8 as he dined with the wife of an associate in the Bravo Sergio Restaurant on Second Avenue near 75th Street . The gunman was described as a white man about six feet tall , dressed in a dark suit , who slipped through a normally locked side door and shot his victim twice in the head from behind , before escaping through the same door. // The police official said he believed Mr. Schiff had been a loan shark who was murdered to discharge a large debt . " He had a lot of loan money out , " the official said . A private investigator said , however , that Mr. Schiff may have been laundering money. // A lawyer who has spent his career tracking down assets for creditor-clients said he had never come across a stranger case . Despite Mr. Schiff ' s vast trappings of wealth , the lawyer said , he had so far failed to verify a single piece of property or asset in Mr. Schiff ' s name . But he was convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He couldn ' t go through life without some of it sticking to him , " said the lawyer who spoke on condition of anonymity . A Gentleman of Luxury : Paying $13 , 000 a Month At the time of his death , Mr. Schiff was paying $13 , 000 a month to rent a multimillion dollar 30th and 31st floor duplex in the St. James Tower at 415 East 54th Street , one of the city ' s most expensive condominiums . The three-bedroom apartment , which Mr. Schiff moved into last December , featured remote-control window blinds and a private elevator in place of a staircase between the two levels . Previously he had sublet a 45th floor apartment in the equally prestigious Sovereign cooperative at 425 East 58th Street. // Mr. Schiff was a decorous and well-liked resident at the St. James , people there said . He allowed the daughter of his closest friends , a Long Island family , to live in one of the bedrooms while she attended nursing school in the city . But his relationship with her was always described as familial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the building said . One was Joseph D ' Onofrio , with whom Mr. Schiff ran an entertainment production company . Another was Connie Rocco , a pop singer who Mr. Schiff promoted and sometimes introduced as his girl friend or fiancee . Miss Rocco declined through her lawyer to discuss her relationship with Mr. Schiff but said it was not as close as Mr. Schiff had portrayed . Mr. D ' Onofrio did not answer a message left with his number in Brigantine , N.J. // But when Miss Rocco stayed at the condominium , friends said , Mr. Schiff , meticulous over appearances of propriety , took pains to sleep at the Sovereign or elsewhere. // Athough he was never seen wearing a suit and tie , he wore expensive monogrammed shirts and , on the coldest days , a cashmere or silk V-neck sweater . He tipped lavishly , often searching through a large roll of $50 ' s and $100 ' s to extract a $20 bill for the doorman. // Among the puzzling episodes to come to light since the killing was an urgent visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday or Tuesday before . According to a person familiar with the story , the visitor was Edward Garofalo , an owner of a Brooklyn demolition company , Mitron Associates . In 1985 , Mr. Garofalo was convicted of reckless endangerment and operating without a permit for illegally demolishing four brownstones on West 44th Street . The developer who ordered the demolition was allowed to plead guilty and settled the charge with a $2 million payment to the city . Mr. Garofalo was sentenced in February 1986 to a conditional discharge as long as he did not commit any crimes for a year. // Last April a New Jersey state grand jury indicted Mr. Garofalo along with 15 others and 11 trucking concerns on charges of racketeering and conspiring to bribe North Bergen officials to accept the dumping of New York construction debris . Charged along with Mr. Garofalo were his brother , Emmanuel , and a cousin , who spelled his name Edward Garafola , of Staten Island . All pleaded not guilty. // The Edward Garofalo said to have visited Mr. Schiff did not return a call left with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the account attributed to Mr. Schiff , he was seeking to evade Mr. Garofalo , who insisted on coming to see him about an urgent matter he wanted Mr. Schiff to intervene in . Mr. Schiff finally let him up , the two men met for awhile , and Mr. Garafalo left. // The police official familiar with the Schiff case said Mr. Garofalo had recently become a frequent companion of Mr. Schiff . A Shadowy Trail Of Bad Checks According to accounts assembled from associates and public records , Mr. Schiff was born in the Bronx on Jan. 5 , 1937 . He attended William Howard Taft High School , graduating about 1954 . Associates said they did not think he attended college . He was described as very close to his mother , Rosie , who died of cancer about two years ago , and a brother , Bernard , who also died of cancer several years earlier. // In 1962 , according to Rockland County records found by the District Attorney , Kenneth Gribetz , Mr. Schiff was arrested for assault , but the charge was later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misdemeanor after passing a bad check for $700 to a hotel . His family later made restitution and he was sentenced to a two-year suspended sentence and two years ' probation. // At the time he gave his address as his mother ' s house off Pelham Parkway in the Bronx . And he listed his profession , although he already weighed over 250 pounds , as a self-employed " health instructor. " // At the same time he was also in trouble elsewhere . Rockland County officials , seeking to prosecute him on the bad-check charge , found him in the Federal prison in Danbury , Conn. , serving a year ' s prison sentence for the interstate transportation of forged checks. // In a letter to Rockland County authorities at the time , Mr. Schiff made reference to still another seven-month sentence facing him in Manhattan for a larceny conviction. // Records of the Rockland County District Attorney ' s office also carry a notation dated April 29 , 1963 , that Mr. Schiff had spent a week in Bellevue Hospital and was thereafter being treated as an outpatient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record is virtually impossible. // Mr. Schiff subsequently told associates that the Federal sentence was a pretext to get him into a cell with another offender to coax a confession . The account contributed to rumors that he was a Federal informant . But like so much of his story , it proves almost impossible to verify. // A plethora of fraud and bad-check charges dogged him through the 1970 ' s and 80 ' s . In 1971 , according to court records , one of Mr. Schiff ' s companies , East-West Holding Corporation in Rockland County , took out American Express cards in the names of Mr. Schiff and two associates . Using a maternity boutique in White Plains and a restaurant in Rockland , they then ran off fictitious charges totalling $127 , 230 and submitted them for reimbursement to American Express , while defaulting on the card bill when it arrived , according to the complaint. // In 1976 , according to other accounts , Mr. Schiff contracted to put up $600 , 000 for the making of a film about Lucky Luciano , the Mafia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles producer , Dominic Orsatti , sued him for the money . Mr. Orsatti subsequently won a judgment for the debt , now up to about $1 million with interest but was still searching for Mr. Schiff ' s elusive assets to satisfy the claim. // Mr. Orsatti said this week in an interview that during the dispute Mr. Schiff said he had put out " a contract " on the producer ' s life . Mr. Orsatti also said that during a hearing on the protracted case just this past June , Mr. Schiff told the creditor ' s lawyer , " You ' ll be dead by morning . " But the threats proved empty , he said. // A private investigator representing another creditor with a judgment said Mr. Schiff had once threatened to " cut up " the creditor ' s daughters , but they were never harmed. // He also said he learned that Mr. Schiff had once taken $6 , 500 from a elderly woman for a down payment on a car and had never delivered the car or returned the money. // If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets has not yet yielded a seizable asset , it has nonetheless uncovered a tangle of still-unexplained connections to other companies . Bank records show millions of dollars of apparent loans from Mr. Schiff to two companies , Roadworks , an auto leasing agency in Great Neck , L.I. , and Luis Electrical Contracting Corporation in Long Island City . Both companies have declined to respond to questions . But acquaintances of Mr. Schiff said an official at the Luis company , Domenico Rabuffo , was one of his frequent companions. //
