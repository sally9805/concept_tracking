 | Taxpayers before long will reap the bitter harvest of the worst farm depression in decades . The Farm Credit System , a farmer-owned cooperativelending network , needs perhaps $5 billion in public funds to avert collapse . As corporate bailouts go , this will be colossal . Chrysler 's rescue , a loan guarantee worth $1.5 billion , generated Washington a $311 million profit . The rescue of Continental Illinois may result in little net cost . Not so with FCS . A 1985 plan to force financially healthy member banks to share surplus funds with their money losers only pulled the strong down with the weak . A federal court in February stopped the share-the-wealth scheme . Losses continue to mount ? nearly $4 billion the past two years . Reserves set aside to cover these losses have plunged from $3.4 billion to $1.5 billion since 1985 , and the FCS still has $3.6 billion in bad debts on its books . Farmers fear their $4.4 billion in FCS stock ? they must purchase shares when they borrow from any of the FCS 's local 387 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The FCS 's most creditworthy customers are paying off loans at a rate of $1 billion a month and refinancing at competing banks , leaving FCS with risky borrowers . To keep customers , most FCS units have cut interest rates to as low as 9 to 10 percent , but that only increases the operating loss . The Omaha regional bank , whose rates range from 9.75 to 12.5 , needs 17.7 percent to break even ? 10.9 percent for the cost of funds , 4.5 percent for operating expenses and 2.3 percent for loan losses . Seize the FCS before injecting public money , the General Accounting Office recommended to Congress last week . There 's little doubt that Congress will pony up . If the FCS went out of business , most of the borrowers ? particularly the shaky ones ? would seek financing from the equally troubled federal Farmers Home Administration . Either way , taxpayers wind up footing the bill . The rights of spring Pill-popping corporations are in for headaches this spring . Some of the nation 's biggest pension funds ? which together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firms ? are taking aim at poison pills in upcoming annual shareholders ' meetings . The usual poison pill gives shareholders , in the event of a hostile tender offer , the right to buy additional stock at low prices and greatly increase the purchase price . Some 600 firms have adopted poison pills , and shareholders are expected to challenge poison pills imposed by some 50 companies , from American Brands to Unisys , at annual meetings this year . One battle of the pill pits the College Retirement Equities Fund , with more than $25 billion in assets , against International Paper . Chief investment officer James Martin says the fund , which owns 2 percent of IP , will try at IP 's annual meeting on April 14 to persuade management to allow shareholders to  | vote on the poison pill . " Any management with the slightest regard for its shareholders should submit such a proposal to its shareholders , " he says . Companies defend pill use , claiming it is needed to dissuade raiders . Besides , says an International Paper spokesman , its pill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote and can not be rescinded . With lines sharply drawn , attendees of annual meetings may want to reach for Alka-Seltzer . A bet on better news ? These are uneasy days for Texaco 's 278,300 shareholders . They have seen the value of their holdings decline 19 percent since 1985 while the stock of other large oil companies rose 58 to 92 percent . Now , after a series of setbacks in Texaco 's efforts to escape an $11 billion court award won by Pennzoil , shareholders are facing a dilemma : Swallow their losses and sell before courts spring the trap , or hold and hope that Texaco ultimately prevails in court or settles favorably . " The worst is over , " says First Boston analyst William Randol , who figures the market already has cut $7 billion from Texaco 's value since the adverse jury ruling in November , 1985 . Other experts , including Donald Fernow of Thomson McKinnon Securities , predict that the case will be settled for no more than $5 billion . Texaco 's appraised value is $69.15 a share , far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed occur . Texaco may declare bankruptcy to avoid posting an $11 billion bond while it appeals . Analysts say Texaco shares could tank to $25-$30 in bankruptcy . To avert just such a course , Texaco President James Kinnear and Pennzoil Chairman Hugh Liedtke huddled in Houston last week , seeking a middle ground . Finding it wo n't be easy . Appraised at $54.45 a share , Pennzoil trades at $87 ? overvalued unless it wins a huge pile of marbles . Bankruptcy would hurt Pennzoil , too . In that event , warns analyst Philip Dodge of Donaldson Lufkin &; Jenrette , " both stocks would lose 25 percent . " UAL 's crash course New York real-estate developer Donald Trump motions out the penthouse window of Trump Tower at UAL 's Plaza Hotel . " That 's a hell of an asset , " he says . " If it were run properly , it could be legendary . " United Airlines pilots look out their cockpit windows and see the competition gaining . Remarks pilot Hank Krakowski : " We 'll soon be No. 3 if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not in hotels . " That , in a nutshell , is why the independence of UAL , the airline-hotel-car rental-travel company , is now in doubt . Its pilots last week bid $4.5 billion just to buy the airline . Unhappy investors like Trump hold as much as 10 percent of UAL 's stock , which is soaring like a turbojet in anticipation of a buyout . Following a strike in 1985 and the resulting acrimony , United pilots are eager to take pay cuts to support the buyout ? one DC-10 pilot even mortgaged his house for a loan . Their union 's pension plan has a $300 million surplus for a cash down payment . Still , their chances would be slim were it not for the circling of investors like Trump , who are attracted by UAL 's hotels . One UAL strategy , suggested by analyst David Sylvester of Montgomery Securities : Boost stock prices by spinning off parts of subsidiaries . UAL could also buy back shares , but would look somewhat foolish ? Chairman Richard Ferris has been peddling new shares to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and the Fidelity Fiduciary Bank ! Denver cableTV magnate Bill Daniels is starting a bank for children ? the post-piggy-bank crowd . He put $1.5 million of his money into the venture , and is lining up corporate sponsors . Hand it to the guy for spotting a developing market : By 1990 , there will be 71.5 million Americans age 18 or under . The 13-to-19 age group spent $48.1 billion in 1984 and has $9.3 billion stashed in savings . Davis calls his new venture the Kids Bank . But to millions of those kids , Fidelity Fiduciary might strike a more familiar chord . THINGS TO WATCH . Home-equity trend . Latest wrinkle in the red-hot competition among lending institutions for home-equity loans : Fixed interest rates . Until now , virtually all such loans carried variable interest rates linked to the fluctuations in the prime rate charged by banks . Wells Fargo Credit , based in Scottsdale , Ariz. , and Goldome FSB in Buffalo , N.Y. , recently began offering homeowners fixed rates . For the moment , their fixed rates are about the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they will not rise if the prime rate jumps . Banking analysts predict that more lenders will be forced to offer fixed rates to remain competitive . Rolls-Royce offering . The British aircraft-engine maker , Rolls-Royce , has issued a prospectus for its denationalization next month . Analysts anticipate that 800 million shares will be offered , and that the sale could raise $2.1 billion . The offering will be held May 7 , and shares will begin trading on the London Stock Exchange May 19 . Unfettering natural gas . The House Energy and Power Subcommittee has approved legislation that would repeal the Fuel Use Act , which generally bars the burning of natural gas in large industrial boilers . The Senate Energy Committee already has cleared similar legislation . The Fuel Use Act was passed in 1978 , when Congress decreed that homeowners should have first call on " dwindling " supplies of natural gas . But now there is a natural-gas glut , and Congress feels restrictions on use are unnecessary . Puffing up business . Dunhill Holdings , the famed British tobacconist , is planning a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American stores by 1991 . Dunhill , now with eight U.S. stores , also will add a line of very expensive men 's clothing to go with its existing line of cigarette lighters , fragrances , leather goods and watches . Prices for the tailored , handsewed suits will range from $750 to $2,000. 41
