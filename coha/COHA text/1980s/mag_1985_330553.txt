Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida , a general in the Nigerian army , is a man who always seems to be at the center of the action . In 1975 he and his fellow officers ousted General Yakubu Gowon , who had taken power soon after the outbreak of the bloody four-year Biafran war . The following year , an unarmed Babangida confronted rebellious army officers in Lagos during an attempted coup and persuaded them to surrender . It was he too who masterminded the army coup that , on the last day of 1983 , toppled Shehu Shagari , the civilian President whose winking acceptance of endemic corruption had helped plunge oil-rich Nigeria into a still continuing spiral of poverty . Last week Babangida was in the vanguard of yet another takeover , only this time he took the prize for himself . In a carefully planned coup , the short , stocky general from central Nigeria was installed as President of Africa 's most populous country . It was the sixth coup since Nigeria gained its independence from Britain in 1960 . <P> The announcement that Army Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader Major General Mohammed Buhari without bloodshed caused only moderate surprise among Nigeria 's 90 million citizens . Deposed with Buhari was his top aide , Brigadier Tunde Idiagbon , who occupied the unofficial post of Vice President . Nigerians had watched despairingly as the Buhari regime 's promises to revive the economy and wipe out rampant corruption withered during 20 months of heavy-handed , largely ineffective rule . Last May , Buhari ordered the brutal expulsion of 700,000 illegal immigrants from neighboring African states , jailed hundreds of political opponents and muzzled a once aggressive press . He also soured Nigeria 's relations with its former colonial master , Britain , with a clumsy attempt in July 1984 to kidnap President Shagari 's brother-in-law , former Transport Minister Umaru Dikko , and ship him from London to Lagos in a wooden crate . <P> Babangida , a career soldier trained at U.S. and British military schools , declared in his first address as head of state that Buhari was " too rigid and uncompromising . " Later the new President repealed a law that banned criticism of the government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an estimated 500 political prisoners jailed by Buhari , and promised to curb excesses by the secret police . Radio Lagos reported he had also approved the appointment of 28 military and police officers to the governing Armed Forces Ruling Council . Perhaps the most important promise made by the new military leaders was to reopen stalled talks with the International Monetary Fund on rescheduling Nigeria 's unmanageable foreign debt , now estimated to be $22 billion to $25 billion . Half of all Nigeria 's annual oil revenues ( $12.4 billion in 1984 ) , which account for 95% of its total export earnings , are believed to be sucked up by interest payments on the debt . Moreover , as the world price for crude oil has declined over the past four years , Nigeria 's revenues have been cut in half . Buhari had been seeking an IMF loan of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion to help deal with the growing economic crisis , but he had refused to accept the international agency 's demands that Nigeria first devalue its currency , the naira .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
