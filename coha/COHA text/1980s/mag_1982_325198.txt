COVER STORY <P> How political action committees win friends and influence elections <P> Like electronic images gobbling dots across a video screen , the PAC-men darted among the elegant rooms of the National Republican Club on Capitol Hill . At a fund raiser for Congressman Eldon Rudd of Arizona , they dropped their checks into a basket by the door or pressed them into the candidate 's palm , before heading for the shrimp rolls and meatballs . Downstairs , other PAC-men crowded into a reception for Delaware Congressman Tom Evans , which featured piano music and White House luminaries . A few stopped in at the party for Deborah Cochran of Massachusetts . Because she is a long shot challenger , they mainly left business cards rather than checks . But still she came out ahead ; the cost of the event was picked up by the National Rifle Association . <P> Although Congress has adjourned and most members have headed home for the final stretch of the 1982 campaign , candidates can still be found buzzing back to Capitol Hill . They know that Washington is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where one dips into the honeypot of contributions from political action committees ( PACs ) . In a circular chase that is dominating congressional politics as never before , the candidates are courting the PACs , and the PAC-men are courting the candidates . " Harry Truman said that some people like government so much that they want to buy it , " says Democratic Congressman David Obey of Wisconsin . " The 1982 elections will see Truman proved right . " <P> There is nothing inherently evil about PACs : they are merely campaign committees established by organizations of like-minded individuals to raise money for political purposes , a valid aspect of the democratic process . In the wake of Watergate , Congress amended the federal election laws in 1974 to limit the role of wealthy contributors and end secretive payoffs by corporations and unions . The new law formalized the role of PACs , which were supposed to provide a well-regulated channel for individuals to get together and support candidates . But as with many well-intended reforms , there were unintended consequences . Instead of solving the problem of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond any expectation , pouring far more money into campaigns than ever before . Today the power of PACs threatens to undermine America 's system of representative democracy . <P> This year there are 3,149 PACS placing their antes into the political pot , up from 2,551 in 1980 and 113 in 1972 . The estimated total of funds they will dispense for campaigns this year : a staggering $240 million . There is Back Pac , PeacePac and Cigar-Pac . Beer distributors have a committee named-what else ? - SixPAC . Whataburger Inc. has one called Whata-Pac . The Concerned Rumanians for a Stronger America has a PAC , as does the Hawaiian Golfers for Good Government . And so do most major corporations and unions . <P> By law a PAC can give $5,000 to both a candidate 's primary and general election campaigns , while an individual contributor can give only $1,000 to each . Presidential elections are financed by federal funds , so most of the money is channeled into congressional , state and local races . Since PACs tend to run in packs , a popular candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half his war chest from these
