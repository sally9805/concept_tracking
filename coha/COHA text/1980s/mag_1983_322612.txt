A czar of the counterculture turns on and plugs in <P> Warm bodies have been hired , hardware has been ordered , and both are moving in this month . The 15 or so computers , among them the Apple II , Epson QX-10 and IBM Personal Computer , will occupy two rooms above the ragtag waterfront of Sausalito , Calif . Already a big hand-scrawled chart pinned to one wall proclaims deadlines to meet and procedures to follow . Says Stewart Brand , leading a tour of his future headquarters : " This is the shell . The peas are still falling into place . " <P> Brand , 44 , is the innovative publisher and writer who devised The Whole Earth Catalog in 1968 . That eccentric compendium of mail-order tools , books and philosophical musings sold 2.5 million copies in its several versions and encapsulated the antitechnological attitudes of the ' 60s counterculture . Now Brand believes he can capture the new computer culture between book covers , and Doubleday &; Co. is betting a record sum that he is right . On the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house advanced Brand a whopping $1.3 million to produce an oversize paperback that will guide readers through the maze of personal-computer tools , including commercial software , free software and electronic library services . The book will be called The Whole Earth Software Catalog and reflects Brand 's unique point of view . <P> " It 's an impossible task , therefore interesting , " says Brand , whose first exposure to computers occurred in the late 1960s , when he worked at the Stanford Research Institute . " Most of the Whole Earth audience has accepted computers , more than any other age group . They 've been using technology to mess with their consciousness since they were teenagers . I do n't see a tremendous difference between the technology of drugs and the technology of computers , except that drugs are self-limiting and computers appear not to be . " <P> Brand 's analysis may be skewed , but his timing is sound . Publishers are increasingly receptive to computer-related books , and they are paying especially high premiums for critiques of the programs that turn computers into word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , music synthesizers and video-game machines . Harper &; Row has advanced $600,000 to the editors of InfoWorld , a weekly computer magazine , for a six-volume series of software and hardware reviews , and Simon &; Schuster paid the same amount for a ten-volume series by the staff of PC World , a monthly magazine devoted to the IBM Personal Computer . Now major investors from outside the computer industry are making their moves . Next week a semiannual software inventory called LIST will debut as a monthly , backed by more than $1 million from E.F . Hutton . In September Money magazine , a Time Inc. publication , will issue a special computer buying guide that will include selected software reports .
