A brutal December kills 500 and ruins $500 million in crops <P> December is supposed to be cold , sure , but temperatures on the order of last week 's record breakers ( - 52 in Wisdom , Mont. ; - 14 in Indianapolis ; 0 in Atlanta ) are unseasonably , unreasonably cold . Readings in the Central Plains have been 36 below normal . Not since record keeping began had there been December days so cold in Chicago ( - 25 ) , New Orleans ( 14 ) and dozens of other places in the country 's heartland . Nor did the vicious cold just blow in , flaunt its power briefly and leave . The mercury went down and stayed down : stayed below zero for eight days in Omaha , ten days in Sioux Falls , S. Dak. , three days in St. Louis . Much of the South suffered the most devastating cold in 20 years , and in the Great Plains and Midwest , weather historians saw parallels with dreadful pioneer winters . " This is decidedly the coldest December in Iowa , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will beat 1876 . " Said National Weather Service Meteorologist Kenneth Bergman : " When the records are all in , this may be the worst December in 100 years for the whole U.S. " <P> The worst in many ways . Crop losses , particularly those of citrus fruit in the Sunbelt , could total $500 million . Deaths directly and indirectly attributable to the two-week freeze numbered nearly 500 . Tens of thousands of lives were disrupted . <P> Most of the subzero zone , which stretched from the Rockies east to the Alleghenies , began to warm up just after Christmas , prompting an epidemic of jokes about 15 " heat waves . " Midweek , however , the bitter cold snapped back down the country 's spine , setting records in cities such as Casper , Wyo. ( - 26 ) , Denver ( 15 ) and Amarillo , Texas ( -5 ) . Nor was the worst over for much of the Deep South . Tornadoes roared through Georgia and Florida on Thursday . <P> In Tampa , a few minutes away from fields of ruined fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was practically impossible to forecast , " said NWS Meteorologist David Rittenberry . The freeze , he added , " just came rolling right in . " According to weather experts , high-altitude wind patterns shifted so that cold Arctic air , instead of warming gradually as it drifted east over the U.S. , rushed due south . <P> Across the U.S. , the Arctic downdraft froze bodies of water large and small , sometimes with dire results . The Snake River in Idaho was stopped up by a ten-mile-long ice jam , threatening floods , and Louisiana 's Red River froze up for the first time this century . Coast Guard cutters freed a dozen Lake Erie freighters stuck in 12-ft. - high windrows of ice , and on the frozen Mississippi River near Keokuk , Iowa , 30 towboats pushing about 430 grain barges are trapped until spring . In the shallow Gulf of Mexico bays from Galveston to Port Isabel , Texas , tens of thousands of fish ( speckled trout and redfish ) died in 38 water .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
