To help celebrate its 25th birthday , the Second City comedy troupe has some new trophy cases in the lobby of its Chicago theater . Now they have more space to show off pictures of such former Second Citizens as John Belushi , Joan Rivers , Dan Aykroyd and Bill Murray . Other alumni , including Alan Arkin , Robert Klein and David Steinberg , were back in person recently for an anniversary reunion , which was taped by Home Box Office for airing in April . And in the world beyond , a Second City troupe is established in Toronto , touring companies are on the road , and SCTV is in reruns on the tube , still biting the hand that feeds it . <P> Second City rests on the sparest of theatrical trappings : a few bentwood chairs , a bit of lighting , a piano and six performers . At the start of one recent show , four of them are onstage as Soviet agents trained to imitate the people of Chicago . ( " I am a full professor , so I only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do anything ; I work for the city . " ) The props are simple and the costuming sparse . Ski hats and overcoats are enough to dress all six as victims of Reagan-era policies . " We wear our characters lightly and dress them lightly , " says Co-Founder Bernard Sahlins . " Put on a pair of glasses and you 've got a businessman . " Put on a beret , as Troupe Member Richard Kind does later , and you have Jean-Paul Sartre , unpleasantly surprised to discover that there is an afterlife and that God , played by Mike Hagerty , is a sort of hearty camp counselor . Sartre : It 's not what I expected . God : What did you expect ? <P> Sartre : Nothing . <P> In this cabaret the guiding idea is improvisation . Most of the dozen or so skits in each revue are scripted and rehearsed , but they begin life as spontaneous vignettes developed at the end of each night 's performance , when the audience is asked to yell out ideas for the cast to work up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then return with the results . Afterward , cast and director refine the best bits into formal scenes for the next revue . Tonight the audience is asked to suggest professions . " Psycho killer ! " someone shouts . O.K. , you asked for it . Dan Castellaneta , a stand-in that night , comes back as a bellowing lunatic , confronting an unfortunate career counselor : " Those people are n't dead ! They just went swimming ! Without their limbs ! " <P> Naturally , improvisation is sometimes like swimming without your limbs  --  you just sink . But when it works , you fly , and without instruments . Second City took flight on a December night in 1959 , opening in a converted laundry on North Wells Street , not far from the present , more spacious theater . It was the creation of two University of Chicago alumni , Sahlins and Paul Sills . Earlier , Sills had co-founded the Compass Players , where Mike Nichols and Elaine May first scored their sharp points . Just as the Compass had been , Second City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been quickened by training in the methods of improvisation . Before long , it had gained a reputation as a small pond that spawned big fish , and as veterans took off for Broadway or Hollywood , eager newcomers arrived to take their places . " Everyone will tell you we all loved one another , " snorts Rivers , who arrived in the early ' 60s . " But when the rundown for the night 's show was posted , people would say , ' What do you mean my scene is not on tonight ? ' "
