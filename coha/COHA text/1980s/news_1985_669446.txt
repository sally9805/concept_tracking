He performs a dazzling nonstop array of spins , high leaps , and a circle of outstretched , difficult jetes . He ends on one knee , one hand back on his shoulder , the other arm reaching upward . Pause. . . . // Then he walks nonchalantly toward the camera , takes off the headband , and panting only slightly , says , ' ' To be a male dancer is a proper job . ' ' People might think men who dance are different - effeminate . Well , they are different : ' ' We are stronger , fitter , better trained than most athletes. ' ' // // This arresting figure is Peter Schaufuss , Danish-born top international dancer , new and dynamic artistic director of the London Festival Ballet ( LFB ) , and star and presenter of a four-part TV series on the male dancer. // First seen to enormous acclaim on British TV last summer , the series has attracted the interest of the PBS-TV network in the United States . Negotiations are in progress. // For Mr. Schaufuss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' La Corsaire ' ' is typical of his days here in London . Director for only six months , he has brought about a terrific change in the LFB image - so much so that word has spread that dancers with the Royal Ballet Company have been told to ' ' watch out. ' ' // The TV series , three years in the making , was planned long before Schaufuss thought of joining the LFB . But with perfect timing , it was shown here just a few weeks before he became LFB director , and it ' s been no surprise that box-office receipts in London and elsewhere have been at an all-time high. // At Christmas , for example , tickets changed hands outside London ' s Festival Hall for ( STR ) 50 each ( $64 ) as the company played its ' ' Nutcracker ' ' to full houses every night. // With this stronger audience following , the company ' s dancers have blossomed . Added inspiration has come with Schaufuss ' s own contacts in the ballet world . He has invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superstar Katherine Healy , the Bolshoi ' s polished Vladimir Derevianko , speedy Frenchman Patrick Armand , and the romantic Italian Raffaele Paganini. // ' ' It ' s been very hard work for the company since I came - harder than I ' d like it to be , ' ' Schaufuss told me in an interview , ' ' but we are achieving a polished technique , and the public is realizing it. ' ' // In a long green dressing gown , black T-shirt , and a red hooded sweat shirt , he sat himself down in front of a well-filled desk and excused himself while he munched on a brown-bread sandwich. // He had just finished a two-hour rehearsal of Sir Frederick Ashton ' s ballet ' ' Romeo and Juliet ' ' to be re-created by the LFB this summer . Before that he had taught the company ' s daily ballet class and had begun the morning with a 9 : 30 planning meeting . He expected to be rehearsing other dances all afternoon and evening. // ' ' I have an excellent staff to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waving at the piles of paper on his desk . ' ' I believe the director should stay with the company while it is touring . I ' m taking two classes a week , and dancing ( leading roles ) myself three times a week. // ' ' There ' s very little time for relaxation : I ' ve got a bed in that room ( he pointed behind him ) but I ' ve never had the time so far to rest on it . In fact , I ' ve never even been able to get bedcovers for it , ' ' he laughed. // At 35 , Schaufuss has had a life filled to overflowing with dance . His parents , Mona Vangsaae and Frank Schaufuss , were principal dancers with the Royal Danish Ballet , and Peter studied in and graduated from its school . He first saw the LFB on tour in Copenhagen ' s Tivoli Gardens in 1957 and was impressed. // Rather than staying in Denmark he chose to travel , first to Canada and its National Ballet , then to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads , and on to the New York City Ballet. // He has retained his link with home by dancing with the Royal Danish Ballet on many occasions , and he has made a famous reputation in guest appearances with numerous companies partnering the world ' s top ballerinas with verve , very light and swift footwork , and boyish enthusiasm. // In 1979 he was invited by the LFB to stage Bournonville ' s ' ' La Sylphide , ' ' a ballet associated with the ethereal , neat , and technically demanding style of the Danish Ballet . The production won Schaufuss two major British theater awards and was filmed for television. // ' ' I realized when I worked with the Festival Ballet that it had all the ingredients for a great company , ' ' he told me . ' ' But it needed challenging a little bit further . One good thing in its favor is its flexibility and independence from being chained to an opera house or theater. // ' ' Touring is very good . We try things on the road and develop them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for rehearsals and administration in a mews behind the Royal Albert Hall , it has only two major seasons in London ( at the Festival hall at Christmas and at the Coliseum in July ) . // The LFB is benefiting not only from its director ' s dancing image but also from his sharp business eye , especially given today ' s troubled times in the British arts world . But during our interview , which took place just before new government arts grants were anounced , he shied away from direct answers on finances. // ' ' I don ' t want to jeopardize or predict results - it ' s too close to the funding dates , ' ' he said cautiously . ' ' We ' ll know soon enough. ' ' // A little over half the company ' s expenses are subsidized by the government , with the rest coming from box-office receipts and private funds . After we talked , the government Arts Council announced an increase for the LFB of 2 percent - well below the rate of inflation . At this writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come up with a larger-than-usual grant . The funds won ' t affect this year or next year : The LFB has already laid plans for both of those. // The Arts Council did , however , set aside ( STR ) 93 , 000 ( $119 , 040 ) to raise dancers ' salaries in line with those of the Royal Ballet Company. // ' ' We ' re working hard in obtaining sponsorships now , ' ' he said , ' ' but in England it ' s different to the US system , where sponsoring companies can claim tax deductions. ' ' // His busy ballet whirl leaves Schaufuss little time for a personal life , although ' ' the company is like a big family. ' ' // ' ' Do you have any regrets ? ' ' I asked . He shook his head . ' ' No , ' ' he answered carefully . ' ' Of course , I ' d have liked a family . ' ' With a smile he added , ' ' But it ' s not too late. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
