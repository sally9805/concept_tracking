In North Waldoboro , Maine , Ethelyn Morse plants eight acres of cabbage , continuing a 70-year old family tradition of preparing and selling sauerkraut. // She sells the Morse sauerkraut by mail , in a bucket with mailing label tied to the handle . She also raises other vegetables and all kinds of dried beans . But a special recipe for beet relish and the one for sauerkraut have been the Morse specialties for many years. // These people , and many others , are making one-of-a-kind foods that you ' ll never find on supermarket shelves . They are also fulfilling what to many Americans today is the ideal way to work. // The great American dream for some may still be to build a dream house , or write the great American novel , or get to be president . But things are changing. // Today ' s American dream is often to work at home , concocting or inventing the perfect chocolate cookie or the best smoked bluefish , or the most authentic country sausage or blackberry jam. // Hundreds of people are doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across America , run by people who are genuinely happy turning out good , useful things , surrounded by families and friends who love and respect their sincerity. // They have no agents , for the most part , no marketing or public-relations firm , no colorful labels or logos. // You will not find their products at the booths of the large , international gourmet shows , nor do they promote their secret recipes in fancy cookbooks. // Proof of this change in the ideal dream job comes from two sisters , Allison and Margaret Engel , who have spent the last several years collecting examples of the best products of the country ' s small food producers. // The range of foods is staggering and includes edible seaweeds from Steuben , Maine , Cinnamon Potato candy from Philadelphia , Baseball Park Mustard from Cleveland , and block ice shipped in sawdust , harvested from a lake in northern Wisconsin. // Here are some examples of small producers that show the depth and breadth of American specialty foods : // // * American Spoon Preserves are made of wild blueberry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company operated by wild food foragers Justin Rashid and Kate Marshall in Petosky , Mich. // // * Ruth Orrell of Wye Mills , Md. , started baking old-fashioned beaten biscuits for pin money . She now has a thriving business. // // * Smoked lobster is produced by Ute and Dietrich Kohn , who emigrated from northern Germany to the central coast of Maine , at Thomaston . They started smoking local fish because they missed eating them so much. // // * Spicy dilled beans are pickled and mailed from Bowdoinham , Maine. // Some of these people have been in business for years , quietly turning out especially fine foods using old-fashioned methods . Some have built a local reputation around one product that is produced with infinite care at every step. // ' ' Many small food companies are completely unknown outside their own community , ' ' says Allison Engel. // ' ' Indeed , some have been an integral part of their communities for so long that friends and neighbors have no idea how unusual the products are , ' ' she told an audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Not all are old family businesses . Some are operated by educated professionals who left established careers to make farmstead cheeses , to smoke trout or turkey , or to grow quail or special poultry. // Others rescued a traditional food or process from culinary extinction by appealing to nostalgic people eager to recapture foods the way they used to taste or the way mother made them. // Still others are typical of today ' s young , well-educated Americans who are establishing a place for themselves , producing top-quality special foods not available here in the past. // Sadie Kendall , for example , has a college degree in philosophy and was headed for law school until the goats she was raising as a hobby caused her to change her mind . Instead , she took a degree in dairy manufacturing and opened her dairy in Atascadero , Calif. , three years ago. // Now she makes a variety of soft goat cheeses , a goat and cow milk Camembert-type cheese , an unripened cows ' milk butter , and a thick creme fraiche. // People today want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In many cases the food comes from small , country businesses undiscovered and ignored by the big grocery chains. // The Engel sisters , both journalists , have written a book about these people. // They traveled around , talking to people and sampling products . They admit they may have overlooked some food finds around the country . The Lehigh bologna recalled from his past by novelist John Updike as more peppery than Lebanon bologna couldn ' t be located. // Their book ' ' Food Finds : America ' s Best Local Foods and the People Who Produce Them ' ' ( Harper &; Row , $12. 95 ) is actually a guidebook and mail-order catalog complete with names , addresses , and phone numbers. // ' ' We found some of our best products , especially jams and preserves , at monasteries , and each one told us about other places to see , ' ' Allison says. // ' ' The Brigittines in California , for example , make incomparable fudge . They told us about the Benedictine monks in southern Indiana who smoke meats , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fruit cake , and so on. ' ' // Many of the small companies have been through years of difficult times . Their products are in a sense endangered foods because they depend on one or two key people with nobody willing to keep the tradition going. // Of the 342 foods profiled in the Engels ' forthcoming book , about 85 percent can be ordered by mail . But Allison is quick to point out that often the settings make a personal visit infinitely more rewarding. // With very few exceptions the authors found no official mention of unique food companies in regional promotional brochures. // ' ' Perhaps there should be a way of honoring such companies by naming them ' ' Historic Culinary Landmarks , ' ' Allison suggests . ' ' By allowing these firms to continue using age-old methods in making their one-of-a-kind foods that have no equal on supermarket shelves , the country would be giving due recognition to the unique contributions of some largely unsung artists. // ' ' We should find some way to restore and preserve our American culinary resources.
