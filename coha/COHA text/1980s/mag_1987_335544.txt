During the Great Depression , the newly homeless squatted outside American cities in shantytowns derisively christened Hoovervilles . Last week Los Angeles opened a spruced-up , officially sanctioned version of the same thing , called an " urban campground , " on a dusty , windswept lot between the Los Angeles River and the city 's skid row . From a distance , the rows of yellow- and-white canopies look as if they might have been set up for a garden party . But inside are only Army-green cots with portable toilets placed nearby . Guards from the Salvation Army , which worked with Mayor Tom Bradley to establish the settlement , frisked the 350 new residents for weapons , liquor or drugs . <P> Bradley was under pressure to offer an alternative to the homeless after he ordered police to clear them from the sidewalks . But critics promptly termed the tent settlement a concentration camp . At best , it provides only a temporary respite for its residents . In two months the lot will be cleared for construction of a rail yard , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . Undoubtedly many will drift back to the streets .
