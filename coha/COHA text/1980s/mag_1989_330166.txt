After more than two troubled years as the Government 's top savings and loan regulator , M. Danny Wall fell victim to the nation 's spreading S &L; scandal . The clamor for his ouster mounted last month after lower-ranking bank examiners told Congress that Wall had unduly delayed for 21 months a Government takeover of high-flying financier Charles Keating 's Lincoln Savings &; Loan Association , whose collapse could cost taxpayers $2.5 billion . Last week Wall finally bowed to the pressure and resigned as director of the Office of Thrift Supervision . He had been victimized , Wall complained , by " simplistic efforts to find a scapegoat to shoulder the blame for the entire thrift crisis . " <P> That crisis could soon become worse , because new requirements designed to strengthen the thrifts could instead push many of them into extinction . Starting last week , S &Ls; must greatly increase their capitalization as a hedge against losses from problem loans , interest-rate swings and bad investment decisions . Among other things , they will be required to maintain " risk-based capital " equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centers and fancy resorts . Because many thrifts are only marginally profitable , raising the funds to meet the standards may prove impossible for them . Some analysts warn that half the nation 's 2,900 thrifts could eventually fail or be merged , voluntarily or involuntarily , adding billions to the $300 billion cost of the industry bailout . An early casualty : City Federal Savings Bank , New Jersey 's largest thrift , was taken over by federal regulators on Friday , after recording huge losses from real estate ventures . <P> Before the ominous S &L; predictions had a chance to sink in , alarms were going off about other potentially monumental crises . A report by Budget Director Richard Darman warned that careless management at such agencies as the Veterans Administration and the Department of Energy may have allowed scandals rivaling the estimated $8 billion imbroglio at the Department of Housing and Urban Development to go undetected . But the gravest worries were triggered by concerns about the solvency of more than $5 trillion in federal credit and insurance programs that cover everything from bank deposits to student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all such programs to fail , bad debts and write-offs are steadily increasing . " Losses from these programs have already cost the taxpayers tens of billions of dollars and have had a significant impact on the federal deficit , " warns Charles Bowsher , the U.S. Comptroller General . Adds Michigan Democrat John Dingell , who chairs a House subcommittee on oversight and investigations : " It is as if every man , woman and child in this country each co-signed a personal loan for $20,000 . " <P> The most disturbing fact is that no one knows how severe the problems may be . In a report to Congress last month , the General Accounting Office described the same pattern of sloppy accounting and slack Government supervision that allowed the S &L; debacle to go unchecked . Because many agencies kept such poor books , GAO auditors could not even determine how much of the $5 trillion is at risk of default . " The ignorance , incompetence and corruption in many of the Government loan and loan-guarantee programs are appalling , " says Dingell.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
