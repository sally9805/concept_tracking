When conservative Jacques Chirac became Premier of France in March , the heads of the country 's state-owned corporations knew that their days at the helm could be numbered . Chirac had pledged that he would carry out a sweeping program of denationalization . Observed an executive at a government-controlled bank : " Rather fewer decisions have been made lately . There 's no sense in crawling out on a limb that you know is going to be sawed off . " <P> Last week Chirac ended the suspense : he replaced the heads of twelve large banks , insurance companies and industrial groups . These firms are among 65 that he hopes to sell to private investors . The Premier apparently believes that new management will help the companies make a smooth break with the state .
