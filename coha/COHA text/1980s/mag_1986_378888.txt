People now spend more time sitting down than ever before in history . A minor achievement of modern civilization , maybe , but it could explain why producing a chair has been an obligatory rite for ambitious designers of this century . Charles Eames is still famous mainly for his chairs , and the best-known works of today 's European caf-society designers  --  Philippe Starck , Enzo Mari  --  are chairs . Aalto , Breuer and Mies made their marks in the ' 20s partly by making chairs , and such contemporary architects as Gehry , Meier , Graves , Hollein , Venturi and Ambasz have all felt obliged to design chairs as well as buildings . <P> For Minneapolis-based Bill Stumpf , 50 , chairs , especially office chairs , have been neither a sideline nor a flashy aesthetic afterthought . The Miesian , Eamesian , entirely worthy benchmark Stumpf set for himself years ago was " to make a beautiful chair comfortable . " He accomplished that by drawing on more than a decade of careful thought about chairs  --  not just how they ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while sitting in them . Stumpf 's Ergon ( 1976 ) and Equa ( 1984 ) are the two most important chairs , surely , of the past quarter-century , handsome , generous and deeply elegant . They are also ubiquitous : the Herman Miller company has sold nearly 2 million Ergons and , in less than two years , some 350,000 Equas . <P> Back in 1966 at the University of Wisconsin , Stumpf was already examining precisely the way bodies and furniture get along . The new name for his human-factor investigations , ergonomics , was not yet current , but Stumpf made charts , diagrams and , eventually , time-lapse films , becoming a sort of Muybridge of the 9-to-5 realm . In the mid- ' 70s at Herman Miller , he began turning that research into drawings . The Ergon is a descendant of Eames ' designs , an out-of-sequence missing link between the lucid but barebones molded-plywood chair ( 1946 ) and the voluptuous , baroque lounge chair ( 1956 ) so beloved of big men with dens . The quiet swerves of Ergon 's separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft and purposeful . No earlier American chair had been mounted on a gas-cylinder post , an innovation that finally buffered the shock for sitters who tend to free-fall rather than descend gently into a desk chair .
