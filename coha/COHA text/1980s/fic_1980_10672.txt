'S PASSINGlooked foolish beside the old-fashioned bins of nails . He would scowl at the rusty window grilles , which had been twisted out of shape by several different burglars . Morgan would just smile , anxiously tugging his beard , for he knew that he tended to irk Uncle 011ie and he was better off sayingnothing at all . Then Uncle 011ie would storm out again and Morgan would go back to his office , relieved , humming beneath his breath . Not that closing this branch down would have left him unemployed ; for Bonny 's sake , the Cullens would feel bound to find him something else . But here he had more scope . He had half a dozen projects under way in his office  --  lumber stacked against the stairs , a ball-peen hammer in his OUT basket . He knew of a good place to eat not far off . He had friends just a few blocks over . His one clerk , Butkins , did nearly all the work , even if he was n't so interesting to talk to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl clerk named Marie . She was a very young , round-faced redhead who alwayswore a loose gray smock to protect her clothes from the dust . Morgan started pretending she was his wife . It was n't that he found her all that appealing ; but he slowly built this scene in his mind where she and he were the owners of a small-town Ma-and-Pa hardware store . They 'd been childhoodsweethearts , maybe . Mentally , he aged her . He would have liked her to have white hair . He started wearing a wrinkled gray jacket and gray work trousers ; he thought of himself as " Pa Hardware . " The funny thing was , sometimes he could be looking right at her but daydreaming her from scratch , as if she were n't there . Then one afternoon he was standing on the ladder putting some shelves in order and she was handing him boxes of extension cords , and he happened to lean down and kiss her on the cheek . He said , " You look tired , Ma . Maybe you ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasped but said nothing . The next day she did n't show up for work , and she never came again . Her gray smock still hung in the stockroom . Occasionally , when he passed it , 41Morgan felt sad all over again for the days when he had been Pa Hardware . But now he had this Butkins , this efficient , colorless young fellow already setting out a new display of Rubbermaid products in the window . " Morning , " Morgan told him . He went on up to his office . He took off his parka , hung it on the coat tree , and sat down in the cracked leather swivel chair behind his desk . Supposedly , he would be dealing with the paperwork now  --  typing up orders , filing invoices . Instead he opened the center drawer and pulled out his bird-feeder plans . He was building the feeder for Bonny . Next Tuesday was their anniversary . They had been married for nineteen years ; good God . He unrolled the plans and studied them , running a nicotine-stained finger across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung by a post in which he would drill four suet holes  --  or peanut-butter holes , for Bonny claimed that suet caused cholesterol problems . Morgansmiled to himself . Bonny was a little crazy on the subject of birds , he thought . He weighted the plans flat with a stapler and a pack of drill bits , and went to find a good plank to begin on . For most of the morning he sawed and sanded and hummed , occasionally pausing to push back his hat and wipe his face on his sleeve . His office stairs made a fine sawhorse . At the front of the store a trickle of shoppers chose their single purchases : a mousetrap , a furnace filter , a can of roach spray . Morgan hummed the " W.P.A. Blues " and chiseled a new point on his pencil . Then Butkins went to an early lunch , leaving Morgan in charge . Morgan had to rise and dust off his knees , regretfully , and wait on a man in coveralls who wanted to buy a Hide-aKey . " What for ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little tin box ? Do you see the price on this thing ? " " Well , but last week I locked the keys inside my car , do n't you know , and I was thinking how maybe I could hide an extra key beneath the  --  " MORGAN 'S PASSING " Look , " said Morgan . " All you do is take a piece of dental floss , waxed . Surely you have dental floss . Thread your extra key on it , double it for strength , tie it to your radiator grille and let the key hang down inside . Simple ! Costs you nothing . " " Well , but this here Hide-a-Key  --  " " Are you not standing in the presence of a man whose wife perpetually mislays his car keys for him ? " Morgan asked . The man glanced around him . " Me , I mean . She loses all I own , " Morgan said , " and I 've never had a Hide-a-Key in my life . " " Well , still , " the man said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead with this here . " " What is it ? " Morgan asked . " You do n't have dental floss ? Never mind ! I tell you what I 'll Free , no charge . A gift . All right ? I 'll bring you in a yard or two . " " For Christ 's sake , " said the man , " will you let me buy one cruddy Hide-a-Key ? " Morgan flung his hands up . " Of course ! " he said . " Be my guest ! Waste your money ! Fill your life with junk ! " He stabbed the cash-register keys . " A dollar twenty-nine , " he said . " It 's my dollar twenty-nine , I 'll waste it however I like , " said the man , pressing the money into Morgan 's palm . " Maniac . " " Junkie ! " The man rushed off , clutching his Hide-a-Key . Morgan muttered to himself and slammed the cash register shut . When Butkins came back , Morgan was free to go to lunch . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickles . All the other customers were black , though , and they would n't talk to him . They seemed to spend their mealtimes passing tiny wads of money to the counterman , and then mumbling and looking off sideways under lowered lids . Meanwhile Morgan slouched over his plate and chewed happily on a pickle . It43really was a wonderful pickle . The garlic was so strong it almost fizzed . But you only got one to a plate , alongside your sandwich . He 'd asked time and time again for an extra , but they always said no ; he 'd have to order another hamburgerthat he did n't even want . After he finished eating , he thought he 'd take a walk . He had a regular pattern of places he liked to visit . He zipped his parka and set off . The day had not warmed up much ; the passers-by had pinched , teary faces . Morgan was glad of his beard . He turned up his collar and held it close and proceededalmost at a run , squinting against the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potter had someone with him  --  a gawky , plain young woman trying out a violin . " Father Morgan ! " Potter cried . " Miss Miller , meet Father Morgan , the street priest of Baltimore . How 's it going ? How 're your addicts ? Come in and have some tea ! " But customers here were rare , and Morgan did n't want to interrupt . " No , no , " he said , holding up a hand . " I must be on my way . Blessings ! " and he backed out the door . He cut through an alley and came out on Marianna Street . An exotic woman with a torrent of black hair stood beside a hot-dog cart . Her make-up was stupendous  --  a coppery glaze on her skin , a flaring red slash of a mouth , and mascara so heavily applied that each eyelash seemed strung with black beads . Now that it was winter , she was wrapped in old coats and sweaters , but Morgan knew from warmer seasons that underneath she wore a red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold-tone bracelets . " Zosem pas ! " he called out to her . " Well , hey ! " she said . She spoke extra brightly , exaggeratingher lip movements . " How you today ? Get a letter from home ? " Morgan smiled humbly and looked perplexed . " Letter ! " she shouted . She wrote on her palm with an imaginary pencil . " You get a letter ? " " Ah ! " said Morgan , suddenly realizing . He shook his head . MORGAN 'S PASSING " Pok , " he said sadly . " Kun salonaen baso . " The corners of his mouth turned down ; he scuffed a boot against the wheel of her cart . " You poor man , " she said . " Well , maybe tomorrow , huh ? " " Brankuso , " he told her . " Zosem pas ! " and he waved and grinned and walked on . At the corner of Marianna Street and Crosswell he hesitated . What he would really like was to turn down Crosswell  --  just head in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had n't been in several weeks . He 'd resisted temptation admirably . He shoved both hands in his pockets and set out . CRAFTS UNLIMITED , the sign in the middle of the block said . It was an elderly building , four stories tall . The first-floor bay window was full of patchwork quilts , cornhusk dolls , samplers , woven goods , and puppets . The windows above it were narrower , dark and uncurtained . It was the third-floor windows that Morgan watched , from the shadow of a laundromatdoorway  --  Emily and Leon Meredith 's windows . He had learned their address with no trouble at all , just looked it up in the telephone book . He 'd learned that along about now ( just before the baby 's nap , he supposed ) one or the other of the Merediths would float up behind the window on the left and tug it open . A hand would trail out  --  Emily 's pale hand or Leon 's darker one  --  and there would be a still , consideringmoment while they pondered how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Bonny , with the last few children , had simply thrown whatever was closest into the stroller  --  a blanket , or some older child 's jacket ; anything would do . ) He imagined that the Merediths would also sprinkle a few drops of milk on their wrists before giving their daughter a bottle , and would test the water with the tip of an elbow before lowering her into her bath  --  whatever was instructed , he liked to believe . Whatever the proper method was . He waited , smiling upward , with both hands buried deep in his pockets . Had he missed them ? No , here they came , out the glass45door beside the CRAFTS UNLIMITED sign . Leon carried the baby over his shoulder . ( Naturally they would not have bought a carriage . ) She must be nine or ten months old by now  --  a fat , apple-cheeked child in a thick snowsuit . Emily walked next to Leon , with her hand tucked through his arm and her face lifted and bright , talking to the baby and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Morgan loved the way the Merediths dressed . It seemed they had decided , long ago , what clothes would be their trademark , and they never swerved from it . Leon always wore clean khaki trousers and a white shirt . Below the sleeves of his rustcoloredcorduroy jacket , a half-inch of immaculate white cuff emerged . And Emily wore one of three scoop-necked leotards  --  brown , plum , or ( most often ) black  --  with a matching wrap skirt of some limp material that flowed to mid-calf length . He had noticed such outfits in modern-dance productions on TV , and admired their fluidity . Now he saw that , worn on the street , they made fashion seem beside the point . In fact , the hemline was wrong for this year or even for this decade , he suspected , and who ever heard of such a young girl in such drab colors ? But these costumes seemed to carry their own authority . She did n't look outdated at all . She looked stark , pared down . She had done away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with just two plates and two sets of silver and an earthenware bowl for the baby . He liked to think that their bathroom contained a bar of Ivory soap and three hotel towels . Well , and Leon 's shaving things , of course . But nothing else . No bath oil , talcum tins , acne creams , hairdryers , children 's orthodontic appliances , mingled bottles of perfume swearing at each other , dangling bras and nylons and lace-edged shower caps . He gazed longinglyafter the Merediths . Their two oval faces swung away , private and impenetrable . Their daughter 's face was round as a coin , and stayed visible long after her parents had turned their backs on him , but she was no easier to read . MORGAN 'S PASSINGOf course , what he should have done was gallop across and catch up with them . " Remember me ? Dr. Morgan . Remember ? What a coincidence ! I just chanced to be in the neighborhood , you see . . . " It would n't be difficult . He could take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctoring was so easy  --  a matter of mere common sense . It was almost too easy . He 'd have more trouble sustaining the role of electrician , or one of those men who blow insulating material between the walls of houses . Nevertheless , something stopped him . He felt awed by the Merediths  --  by their austerity , their certitude , their mapped and charted lives . He let them float away untouched , like people in a bubble . A Afternoon drifted over the store , and twilight sank intothe corners . Butkins swallowed a yawn and mused at thewindow . Morgan invented an elaborate sort of paddlewheeldevice to tip squirrels off the bird feeder . He sanded eachpaddle carefully and fitted it into place . He felt comfortedand steadied by this kind of work . It made him think of hisfather , a methodical man who might have been much happieras a carpenter than as an ineffectual high-school Englishteacher . " One thing our family has always believed in , " hisfather used to say , " is the very best quality tools . You buythe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handles . And then you take good care of them . Everything inits place . Lots of naval jelly . " It was the only philosophy he had ever stated outright , and Morgan clung to it now likesomething carved in stone . His father had killed himself duringMorgan 's last year of high school . Without a hint ofdespair or ill health ( though he 'd always seemed somewhatmuted ) , he had taken a room at the Winken Blinken MotorHotel one starry April evening and slit both wrists with arazor blade . Morgan had spent a large part of his life trying47to figure out why . All he wanted was a reason  --  bad debts , cancer , blackmail , an illicit love affair ; nothing would have dismayed him . Anything would have been preferable to this nebulous , ambiguous trailing off . Had his father , perhaps , been wretched in his marriage ? Fallen under the power of racketeers ? Committed murder ? He rifled his father 's correspondence , stole his desk key and his cardboard file box . He mercilessly cross-examined his mother , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just did n't want to talk about it . She went around silent and exhausted ; she 'd taken a job at Hutzler 's selling gloves . Gradually , Morgan stopped asking . The possibility had begun to settle on him , lately , as imperceptibly as dust , that perhaps there 'd been no reason after all . Maybe a man 's interest in life could just thin to a trickle and dry up ; was that it ? He hated to believe it . He pushed the thought away , any time it came to him . And even now he often pored over the file box he had stolen , but he never found more than he 'd found at the start : alphabetized instruction sheets for assembling bicycles , cleaning lawnmowers , and installing vacuum-cleaner belts . Repairing , replacing , maintaining . One step follows another , and if you have completedstep two , then step three will surely come to you . He sanded the paddlewheel , nodding gently . He hummed without any tune . Butkins came up the stairs to say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need . I 'll see you tomorrow . " " Eh ? " said Morgan . " Is it time ? " He straightened and wiped his forehead with the back of his hand . " Well , yes , surely , Butkins , " he said . " So long , then . " The store fell silent and grew fuzzy with darkness . Passers-byhurried home to supper without even glancing in . Morgan got to his feet , put on his parka , and made his way up the aisle . He switched off the lights and locked the three massive , burglar-proof locks . From outside , the place looked like an antique photograph : lifeless , blurred , the knobs and bulges in its window a mystery forever . Maybe GrandfatherMORGAN 'S PASSINGCullen 's ghost came here , nights , and roamed the aisles in a daze , ruminating over the rechargeable hedge clippers . Morganturned his collar up and ran to catch the bus. 5 At supper the grownups sat bunched at one end of the table as if taking refuge from the children  --  Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sister , Brindle , wearing a lavender bathrobe . Brindle had her mother 's sallow , eagle face and hunched posture , but not her vitality . She sat idly buttering pieces of French bread , which she placed in a circle on the rim of her plate , while Louisa recounted , word for word , a cooking program she 'd been watching on TV . " First he put the veal shanks endwise in a pot . Then he poured over them a sauce made of tomato paste , lemon zest , bits of celery . . . but everything was cut up ahead of time ! Naturally it looks easy if you do n't have to witness all the peeling and chopping . " Morgan reached across her for the salt . " There 's not enough real life on television , " Louisa said . " That 's the whole point , " Brindle told her . " I 'd like to see him try scraping the tomato paste out of that little tiny Hunt 's can , too . " " Mother , you went through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's a re-run you were watching , and you made all the same objections too . " " I did not ! I knew nothing about such programs last week . " " You told us every bit of it : the lemon zest , the celery ... " " Are you accusing me of a faulty memory ? " Louisa asked . " Ladies . Please , " said Morgan . It was true there seemed to be some problem lately with his mother 's memory . She had spells when she was doggedly repetitive ; her mind , like an old record , appeared to stick in certain grooves . But it only made her nervous to have it brought to her attention . He scowled at Brindle , who shrugged and buttered another slice of bread. 49Meanwhile his daughters ate in a separate flurry of gossip and quarrels and giggles  --  seven slim , blue-jeaned girls and then someone else , a little white-haired waif with rhinestone car studs , some friend of Kate 's . She sat between Kate and Amy and stared at Morgan narrowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him nervous . He was never truly happy if he felt that even the most random passing stranger found him unlikable . He 'd begun the meal in a fine mood , twirling his spaghetti theatrically on his fork and speaking in a broad Italian accent , but gradually he lost his enthusiasm . " What do you keep looking at ? " he asked now . " Have we met before ? " " Sir ? " " This is Coquette , " Kate told him . " Ah . Coquette . " " Me and her are in the same class at school . We like the same boy . " Morgan frowned . " Same what ? " he said . " This boy named Jackson Eps . " " But you 're only in fifth grade ! " " We liked him in fourth grade too . " " This is ridiculous , " Morgan told Bonny . Bonny smiled at him ; she never knew when to start worrying . " What are things coming to ? " he asked his sister . " Where are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dolls , Ken dolls , Tinkerbell make-up sets . " " I liked a boy in fifth grade , " Brindle said . " You did ? " " Robert Roberts . " " Oh , Lord , Brindle , not Robert Roberts again . " " Robert Roberts was in fifth grade ? " Kate asked . She nudged Coquette . " Robert Roberts was Brindle 's childhood sweetheart , " she said . " He was not only in fifth grade , " said Brindle , " he was also in fourth , third , second . . . We used to have to share our reading-skills workbook ; he was always losing his . In kindergartenwe went shopping once at Bargain Billy 's and he stuck a label on my cheek reading SLIGHTLY IMPERFECT . He alsoMORGAN 'S PASSINGtook me to my first school dance and my first car-date and my senior-class picnic . " Morgan sighed and tipped his chair back . Bonny helped herself to more salad . " Then in college I broke it off , " Brindle told Coquette . " I gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to make it fit my finger  --  half a candle 's worth , it looked like . I 'd probably have drowned if I ever wore it swimming . " " Why 'd you break it off ? " Coquette asked her . " I got married to someone else . " " But why 'd you break it off ? I mean , why marry someone else ? " Brindle pushed her plate away and set her elbows on the table . She said , " Well , I do n't know if . . . When I talk about him , it sounds so simple , does n't it ? But see , even back in kindergarten he would sometimes act silly and sometimes bore me , and yet other times I was crazy about him , and when we grew up it got worse . Sometimes I liked him and sometimes I did n't like him , and sometimes I did n't even think of him . And sometimes he did n't like me , I knew it ; we knew each other so well . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone . I mean , he was my only experience . You understand what I 'm trying to say ? " Plainly , Coquette did n't understand a word . She was growingrestless , glancing toward the plate of Oreos on the sideboard . But Brindle did n't see that . " What I did , " she said , " was marry an older man . Man who lived next door to Mother 's old house , downtown . It was a terrible mistake . He was the jealous type , possessive , always fearing I would leave him . He never gave me any money , only charge accounts and then this teeny bit of cash for the groceries every week . For seven years I charged our food at the gourmet sections of department stores  --  tiny cans of ham and pure-white asparagusspears and artichoke bottoms and hearts of palm , all so I could save back some of the grocery money . I would charge a dozen skeins of yarn and then return them one by one to5 ' the Knitter 's Refund counter for cash . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the end of seven years I said , All right , Horace , I 've saved up five thousand dollars of my own . I 'm leaving . ' And I left . " " She had to save five thousand dollars , " Morgan told the ceiling , " to catch a city bus from her house to my house . Three and a half miles  --  four at the most . " " I felt I 'd been challenged , " Brindle said . " And it 's not as if I had n't offered to help her out , all along . " " I felt I wanted to show him , See there ? You ca n't overcomeme so easily ; I 've got more spirit than you think , ' " Brindle said . Morgan wondered if supplies of spirit were rationed . Did each person only get so much , which could n't be replenishedonce it was used up ? For in the four years since leaving her husband she 'd stayed plopped on Morgan 's third floor , seldom dressing in anything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never mentioned finding a job or an apartmentof her own . And when her husband died of a stroke , not six months after she 'd left , she hardly seemed to care one way or the other . " Oh , well , " was all she 'd said , " I suppose this saves me a trip to Nero . " " Do n't you mean Reno ? " Morgan had asked . " Whatever , " she said . The only time she showed any spirit , in fact , was when she was telling this story . Her eyes grew triangular ; her skin had a stretched look . " I have n't had an easy time of it , you see , " she said . " It all worked out so badly . And Robert Roberts , well , I hear he went and married a Gaithersburg girl . I just turn my back on him for a second and off he goes and gets married . Is n't that something ? Not that I hold him to blame . I know I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all on my own , and it 's far too late to change it . I just set all the switches and did all the steering and headed straight toward ruin . " Ruin echoed off the high , sculptured ceiling . Bonny brought the cookies from the sideboard ; the girls took twoMORGAN 'S PASSINGand three apiece as the plate went past . Morgan let his chair tip suddenly forward . He studied Brindle with a curious , alert expression on his face , but she did n't seem to notice. 6 Now he and Bonny were returning from a movie . They slogged down the glassy black pavement toward the bus stop . It was a misty , damp night , warmer than it had been all day . Neon signs blurred into rainbows , and the taillights of cars , sliding off into the fog , seemed to contract and then vanish . Bonny had her arm linked through Morgan 's . She wore a wrinkled raincoat she had owned since he first met her , and crepe-soled shoes that made a luff-luffing sound . " Maybe tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car put back together . " " Yes , maybe , " said Morgan absently . " We 've been riding buses all week . " Morgan was thinking about the movie . It had n't seemed very believable to him . Everyone had been so sure of what everyone else was going to do . The hero , who was some kind of double agent , had laid all these elaborate plans that depended on some other , unknowing person appearing in a certain place or making a certain decision , and the other personalways obliged . Sentries looked away at crucial moments . High officials went to dinner just when they usually went to dinner . Did n't B ever happen instead of A , in these people 's lives ? Morgan plodded steadily , frowning at his feet . From out of nowhere the memory came to him of the hero 's manicured , well-tended hands expertly assembling a rifle from random parts smuggled through in a leather briefcase . They reached the bus stop ; they halted and peered down the street . " Watch it take all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleated plastic rain-scarf and shook the droplets from it . " Bonny , " Morgan said , " why do n't I own a corduroy jacket ? " 53 " You do , " she told him . " I do ? " " You have that black one with the suede lapels . " " Oh , that , " he said . " What 's wrong with it ? " " I 'd prefer to have rust , " he said . She looked over at him . She seemed about to speak , but then she must have changed her mind . A bus lumbered into view , its windows lit with golden lights  --  an entire civilization , Morgan imagined , cruising through space . It stopped with a wheeze and let them climb on . For such a late hour , it seemed unusually crowded . There were no double seats left . Bonny settled beside a woman in a nurse 's uniform , and instead of finding someplace else Morgan stood rocking above her in the aisle . " I 'd like a nice rust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , " she said dryly , " you 'd have to wear down your own elbows , I expect . " " I do n't know ; I might find something in a secondhand store . " " Morgan , ca n't you stay out of secondhand stores ? Some of those people have died , the owners of those things you buy . " " That 's no reason to let a perfectly good piece of clothing go to waste . " Bonny wiped the rain off her face with a balled-up Kleenex from her pocket . " Also , " Morgan said , " I 'd like a pair of khaki trousers and a really old , soft , clean white shirt . " She replaced the Kleenex in her pocket . She jolted along with the bus in silence for a moment , looking straight ahead of her . Then she said , " Who is it this time ? " " Who is what ? " " Who is it that wears those clothes ? " " No one ! " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm blind ? You think I have n't been through this a hundred times before ? " MORGAN 'S PASSING " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " Bonny shrugged and turned her gaze out the window . They were near their own neighborhood now . Lamp : glowed over the entranceways of brick houses and apartmentbuildings . A man in a hat was walking his beagle . A boy cupped a match and lit a girl 's cigarette . In the seat behind Bonny , two women in fur coats were having a conversation . " I guess you heard the news by now , " one of them told the other . " Angie 's husband died . " " Died ? " asked the other . " Just up and died . " " How 'd it happen ? " " Well , he finished shaving and he put on a little aftershave and he came back into the bedroom and went to sit on the bed  --  " " But what was it ? His heart ? " " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to have an uncomfortable thought . He became convinced that his hand , which gripped the seat in plain view of these two women , was so repulsive to them that they were babbling utter nonsense just to keep from thinking about it . He imagined that he could see through their eyes ; he saw exactly how his hand appeared to them  --  its knuckly fingers , wiry black hairs , sawdust ingrained around the nails . He saw his whole person , in fact . What a toad he was ! A hat and a beard , on legs . His eyes felt huge and hot and heavy , set in a baroque arrangement of dark pouches . " He reached for his socks , " the first woman said desperately , " and commenced to unroll them . One sock was rolled inside the other , do n't you know . . . " She was looking away from Morgan ; she was avoiding the sight of his hand . He let go of the seat and buried both fists in his armpits . For the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped . And when they reached home , where the girls were doing their lessons on the dining-room table and Brindle was laying out her Tarot cards in the kitchen , Morgan went straight up55the stairs to bed . " I thought you 'd like some coffee , " Bonny said . She called after him , " Morgan ? Do n't you want a cup of coffee ? " " No , I guess not tonight , " he said . " Thank you , dear , " and he continued up the stairs . He went to his room , undressed to his thermal underwear , and lit a cigarette from the pack on the bureau . For the first time all day , he was bare-headed . In the mirror his forehead looked lined and vulnerable . He noticeda strand of white in his beard . White hair ! " Christ , " he said . Then he bent forward and looked more closely . Maybe , he thought , he could pass himself off as one of those miracles from the Soviet Union  --  a hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his herd of goats . He brightened . He could cross the country on a lecture tour . At every whistle stop he 'd take off his shirt and show his blackpeltedchest . Reporters would ask him his secret . " Yogurt and cigarettes , comrades , " he cackled to the mirror . He took a couple of prancing steps , showing off . " Never anodder sing but yogurt and Rossian cigarettes . " Feeling more cheerful , he went to the closet for his cardboardfile box , which he placed on the bed . He drew intentlyon his Camel as he padded around , getting arranged : turning on the electric blanket , propping up his pillow , findingan ashtray . He climbed into bed and set the ashtray in his lap . There was a little coughing fit to be seen through first . He scattered ashes down his undershirt . He pinched a speck of tobacco from his tongue . " Ah , comrades , " he wheezed . He opened the file box , took out the first sheet of paper , and settled back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before beginning. 2 . Have on hand the following : pliers , Phillips screwdriver ... He lowered the sheet of paper and gazed at the black windowpanes . Miles away from here , he imagined , the windows on Crosswell Street were blinking out , first the left one , then the right one . The baby would stir in her sleep . Leon 's handMORGAN 'S PASSINGwould drop from the light switch and he would cross the cold floor to their pallet . Then all daytime sounds would stop ; there would only be the sifting breaths of sleepers , motionless and dreamless on their threadbare sheets . Morgan turned his light off too , and settled down for the night. 19691 What was it that he wanted of them ? He was everywhere , it seemed  --  an oddly shaped , persistent shadowtrailing far behind when they went for a walk , lurking invarious doorways , flattening himself around the corner of abuilding . What they ought to do was simply wheel and confronthim . " Why , Dr. Morgan ! "  --  smiling , surprised  --  " hownice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't lent itself tothat , somehow . The first time they 'd seen him ( or felt hispresence , really ) , back when Gina was a baby , they hadn'trealized who he was . Coming home from a shopping trip attwilight , they 'd been chilled by a kind of liquid darknessflowing in and out of alleyways behind them . Emily had beenfrightened . Leon had been angry , but with Emily next to himMORGAN 'S PASSINGand Gina in his arms he had n't wanted to force anything . They had merely walked a little faster , and spoken to each other in a loud , casual tone without once mentioning what was happening . The second time , Emily had been alone . She 'd left the baby with Leon and gone to buy felt for the puppets . Directly opposite their apartment building , in an arched granitedoorway , a figure fell suddenly backward into the gloom of the laundromat . She hardly saw ; she was calculating the yardage she would need . But that evening , as she was making a pointed hat for Rumpelstiltskin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall once more out of sight  --  though he had n't been wearing a pointed hat at all but something flat , a beret , perhaps . Still , where had she seen him before ? She said , " Oh ! " and laid her scissors down . " Guess who I think I saw today ? " she said to Leon . " That doctor . That Dr. Morgan . " " Did you ask him why he never sent a bill ? " " No , he was n't really . . . It was n't a meeting , exactly . I mean , he did n't see me . Well , he saw me , but it seemed he .. . Probably , " she said , " it was n't Dr. Morgan at all . I 'm sure he would have spoken . " A month or so later he followed her along Beacon Avenue . She stopped to look in the window of an infants ' - wear shop and she felt someone else stop too . She turned and found a man some distance away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street at nothing in particular . He might have stepped out of a jungle movie , she thought , with his safari shirt and shorts , his knee-high socks , ankle boots , and huge pith helmet . Extraneousbuckles and D-rings glittered all over him  --  on his shoulders , his sleeves , his rear pockets . It was nobody dangerous . It was only one of those eccentric people you often see on city streets , acting out some elaborate inner vision of themselves . She walked on . At the next red light she glanced back again and here he came , hurrying toward her with a swaggering , soldierly gait to match the uniform , his eyes obscured by the helmet but his abundant beard in full view . Oh , you could n't mistake that beard . Dr. Morgan ! She took a59step toward him . He looked up at her , clapped a hand on his helmet , and darted through a door reading LU-RAE 'S FINE COIFFURES . Emily felt absurd . She felt how open and glad she must look , preparing to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did n't he like her any more ? He had seemed so taken with the two of them , back when Gina was born . She did n't tell Leon . It would make him angry , maybe ; you never knew . She decided that , anyhow , it had only been one of those unexplainable things  --  meaningless , not worth troubling Leon about . So it got off on the wrong foot , you might say . There was a moment when they could have dealt with it straightforwardly , but the moment slipped past them . After several of these incidents ( spaced across weeks or even months ) in which one thing or another prevented them from going up to the man and greeting him naturally , it began to seem that the situation had taken a turn of its own . There was no way they could gracefully set it right now . It became apparent that he must be crazy  --  or , at least , obsessed in some unaccountableway . ( Emily shivered to think of Gina 's deliveryat his hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no harm . He never threatened them or even came within speaking distance of them ; there was nothing to complain of . Really , Emily was taking this too fancifully , Leon said . The man was only something to be adjusted to , as a matter of course . He was part of the furniture of their lives , like the rowhouses looming down Crosswell Street , the dusty , spindly trees dyingof exhaust fumes , and the puppets hanging in their muslin shrouds from the hooks in the back-bedroom closet. 2 Now that it was winter , business had slacked off . There had been a little burst around Christmas ( holiday bazaars , parties for rich people 's children ) , but none of the open-air fairs and circuses that kept them so busy in the sumMORGAN'SPASSINGmer . Emily used the time to build a new stage  --  a wooden one , hinged and folded for portability . She repaired the puppetsand sewed more costumes for them . A few she replaced completely , which led to the usual question of what to do with the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't just dump them in the trashcan . " Use them for spare parts , " Leon always said . " Save the eyes . Save that good nose . " Put Red Riding Hood 's grandmother 's pockmarked cork-ball nose on any other puppet ? It would n't work . It would n't be right . Anyway , how could she tear that face apart ? She laid the grandmother in a carton alongside a worn-out Beauty from " Beauty and the Beast "  --  the very first puppet she 'd ever made . They were on their third Beauty at the moment , a much more sophisticated version with a seamed cloth face . It was n't the plays that wore the puppets out ; it was the children coming up afterward , patting the puppets ' wigs and stroking their cheeks . Beauty 's skin was gray with fingerprints . Her yellow hair had a tattered , frantic look . This whole room belonged to the puppets : the hollow back bedroom , with peeling silvery pipes shooting to the ceiling and a yellow rain stain ballooning down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so sooty that the sun set up an opaque white film in the afternoons . The wooden floor put splinters in Gina 's knees and turned her overalls black . The china doorknob was hazy with cracks . The door hung crooked . Nights , when Emily worked late in the glow of one goose-necked lamp , the hall light that shone beneath the door was not a rod but a wedge , like a very long piece of pie . She sat up late and repaired the witch , the all-purpose stepmother-witch that was used in so many different plays . No wonder she kept wearing out ! One black button eye dangled precariously . Emily perched upon the stepladder that was the room 's only furniture and tied a knot in a long tail of thread . The puppets most in use were kept in an Almaden chablis box in the corner . They poked their heads out of the card-6iboard compartments : two young girls ( one blonde , one brunette ) , a prince , a green felt frog , a dwarf . The others stayed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the drawstrings : Rip Van W. Fool . Horse . King . She liked to change them around from time to time , assign them roles they were not accustomed to . Rip Van Winkle , minus his removable beard , made a fine Third Son in any of those stories where the foolish , kind-hearted Third Son ends up with the princess and half the kingdom . He fitted right in . Only Emily knew he did n't belong , and it gave a kind of edge to his performance , she felt . She ran him through his lines herself . ( Leon played the older two sons . ) She put an extra , salty twang in his voice . The real Third Son , meanwhile  --  morehandsome , with less character  --  lay face-up backstage , grinning vacantly . Emily had never actually planned to be a puppeteer , and even now both she and Leon thought of it as temporary work . She had entered college as a mathematics major , on full scholarship  --  the only girl her age in Taney , Virginia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or taking a job at Taney Paper Products . Her father had been killed in an auto accident when Emily was a baby ; then , early in Emily 's freshman year at college , her mother died of a heart ailment . She was going to have to manage on her own , therefore . She hoped to teach junior high . She liked the cool and systematic process that would turn a tangle of disarrangednumbers into a single number at the end  --  the redistributingand simplifying of equations that was the basis of junior-high-school mathematics . But she had n't even finished the fall semester when she met Leon , who was a junior involved in acting . He could n't major in acting ( it was n't offered ) , so he was majoring in English , and barely scraping by in all his subjects while he appeared in every play on campus . For the first time Emily understood why they called actors " stars . " There really was something dazzling about him whenever he walked onstage . Seen close up , he was a stringy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PASSINGthe outer corners and a mouth already beginning to be parenthesizedby two crescent-shaped lines . He had a bitter look that made people uneasy . But onstage , all this came across as a sort of power and intensity . He was so concentrated . His characters were so sharply focused that all the others seemed wooden by comparison . His voice ( in real life a bit low and glum ) seemed to penetrate farther than the other voices . He hung on to words lovingly and rolled them out after the briefest pause , as if teasing the audience . It appearedthat his lines were invented , not memorized . Emily thought he was wonderful . She had never met anyonelike him . Her own family had been so ordinary and pale ; her childhood had been so unexceptional . ( His had been terrible . ) They began spending all their time together  --  nursing a single Pepsi through an afternoon in the canteen , studying in the library with their feet intertwined beneath the table . Emily was too shy to appear in any plays with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed on as a set-builder . She hammered platforms and stairsteps and balconies . She painted leafy woods on canvas flats , and then for the next play she transformed the woods into flowered wallpaper and **27;7835;TOOLONG . Meanwhile , it seemed that even this slim connection with the theatre was making her life more dramatic . There were scenes with his parents , at which she was an embarrassed observer  --  long tirades from his father , a Richmond banker , while his mother wiped her eyes and smiled politely into space . Evidently , the university had informed them that Leon 's grades were even lower than usual . If they did n't improve , he was going to flunk out . Almostevery Sunday his parents would drive all the way from Richmond just to sit in Leon 's overstuffed , faded dormitory parlor asking what kind of profession he could hope for with a high F average . Emily would rather have skipped these meetings , but Leon wanted her there . At first his parents were cordial to her . Then they grew less friendly . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was what she had n't done . She was always reserved and quiet with them . She63came from old Quaker stock and tended , she 'd been told , to feel a little too comfortable in the face of long silences . Sometimesshe thought things were going beautifully when in fact everybody else was casting about in desperation for something to talk about . So she tried harder to be sociable . She wore lipstick and stockings when she knew they were coming , and she thought up neutral subjects ahead of time . While Leon and his father were storming at each other , she 'd be running through a mental card file searching for a topic to divert them . " Our class is reading Tolstoy now , " she told Leon 's mother one Sunday in April . " Do you like Tolstoy ? " " Oh , yes , we have it in leather , " said Mrs. Meredith , dabbingher nose with a handkerchief . " Maybe Leon ought to take Russian literature , " Emily said . " We read plays too , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn language first , " his father said . " Oh , well , this is in English . " " How would that help ? " Mr. Meredith asked . " I believe his native tongue is Outer Mongolian . " Meanwhile Leon was standing at the window with his back to them . Emily felt touched by his tousled hair and his despairing posture , but at the same time she could n't help wondering how he 'd got them into this . His parents were n't really the type to make scenes . Mr. Meredith was a solid , business-like man ; Mrs. Meredith was so stately and self-controlledthat it was remarkable she 'd foreseen the need to bring a handkerchief . Yet every week something went wrong . Leon had this way of plunging into battle unexpectedly . He was quicker to go to battle than anyone she knew . It seemed he 'd make a mental leap that Emily could n't follow , landing smack in the middle of rage when just one second before he 'd been perfectly level and reasonable . He flung his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fist into his palm . It was all too high-keyed , Emily thought . She turned to Mrs. Meredith again . " Right now we 're on Anna Karenina , " she said . MORGAN 'S PASSING " All that stuff is Communist anyhow , " said Mr. Meredith . " Is . . . what ? " " Sure , this tractor-farming , workers-unite bit , killing off the Tsar and Anastasia ... " " Well , I 'm not . . . I believe that came a little later . " " What is it , you 're one of these college leftists ? " " No , but I do n't think Tolstoy lived that long . " " Of course he did , " Mr. Meredith said . " Where do you think your friend Lenin would be if he did n't have Tolstoy ? " " Lenin ? " " Do you deny it ? Look , my girl , " Mr. Meredith said . He leaned earnestly toward her , lacing his fingers together . ( He must sit this way at the bank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have a loan on his tobacco crop . ) " The minute Lenin got his foot in the door , first person he called on was Tolstoy . Tolstoy this , Tolstoy that ... Any time they wanted any propaganda written , Ask Tolstoy , ' he 'd say . Ask Leo . ' Why , sure ! They did n't tell you that in school ? " " But . . . I thought Tolstoy died in nineteen ... " " Forty , " said Mr. Meredith . " Forty ? " " I was in my senior year in college . " " Oh . " " And Stalin ! " said Mr. Meredith . " Listen , there was a combination . Tolstoy and Stalin . " Leon turned suddenly from the window and left the room . They heard him going up the stairs to the sleeping quarters . Emily and Mrs. Meredith looked at each other . " If you want my personal opinion , " Mr. Meredith said , " Tolstoy was a bit of a thorn in Stalin 's side . See , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of well known by then , but at the same time he was too old-line . You knew he was pretty well off , of course . Owned a large piece of land . " " That 's true , he did , " Emily said . " You can see it must have been a little awkward . " " Well , yes ... " 65 " The fact is , ' Stalin says to his henchmen , he 's an old guy . I mean , he 's just a doddering old guy with a large piece of land . ' " Emily nodded , her mouth slightly open . Leon came pounding down the stairs . He entered the parlor with a dictionary open in his hands . " Tolstoy , Lev , " he read out , " 1828-1910 . " There was a silence . " Born in eighteen twenty-eight , died in nineteen  --  " " All right , " said Mr. Meredith . " But where is this getting us ? Do n't try to change the subject , Leon . We were talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting business . " " I 'm serious about my acting , " Leon said . " Serious ! About play-acting ? " " You ca n't make me give it up ; I 'm twenty-one years old . I know my rights . " " Do n't tell me what I can or can not do , " said Mr. Meredith . " If you refuse , I warn you , Leon : I 'm withdrawing you from school . I 'm not paying next year 's tuition . " " Oh , Burt ! " Mrs. Meredith said . " You would n't do that ! I le 'd be drafted ! " " Army 's the best thing that could happen to that boy , " lr . Meredith said . " You ca n't ! " " Oh , ca n't I ? " He turned to Leon . " I 'm driving home with you today , " he said , " unless I have your signed and notarized statement that you will drop all extracurricular activities  --  plays , girlfriends ... " I le flapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not a chance , " said Leon . " Start packing , then . " " Burt ! " Mrs. Meredith cried . But Leon said , " Gladly . I 'll be gone by nightfall . Not home , t hough  --  not now or ever again . " " See what you 've done ? " Mrs. Meredith asked her husband . MORGAN 'S PASSINGLeon walked out of the room . Through the parlor 's front windows ( small-paned , with rippling glass ) Emily saw his angular figure repeatedly dislocating itself , jarring apart and drawing back together as he strode across the quadrangle . She was left with Leon 's parents , who seemed slapped into silence . She had the feeling that she was one of them , that she would spend the rest of her days in heavily draped parlors  --  a little dry stick of a person . " Excuse me , " she said , rising . She crossed the room , stepped out the door , and closed it gently behind her . Then she started running after Leon . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , idly throwing pebbles into the water . When she came up beside him , out of breath , and touched his arm , he would n't even glance at her . In the sunlight his face had a warm olive glow that she found beautiful . His eyes , which were long and heavy-lidded , seemed full of plots . She believed she would never again know anyone so decisive . Even his physical outline seemed to stand out more sharply than other people 's . " Leon ? " she said . " What will you do ? " " I 'll go to New York , " he said , as if he 'd been planning this for months . She had always dreamed of seeing New York . She tightenedher hand on his arm . But he did n't invite her along . To escape his parents , in case they came hunting him , they walked to a dark little Italian restaurant near the campus . Leon went on talking about New York : he might get something in summer stock , he said , or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said " I , " not " we . " She began to despair . She wished she could find some flaw in his face , which seemed to give off a light of its own in the gloom of the restaurant . " Do me a favor , " he told her . " Go to my room and pack my things , just a few necessities . I 'm worried Mom and Dad will be waiting for me there . " " All right , " she said . " And bring my checkbook from the top dresser drawer . I 'm going to need that money . " 67 " Leon , I have eighty-seven dollars . " " Keep it . " " It 's left over from the spending money Aunt Mercer gave me . I wo n't have any use for it . " " Will you please stop fussing ? " Then he said , " Sorry . " " That 's all right . " They walked back to campus , and while he waited beside the fountain , she went to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two armchairs they had sat in were empty ; the upholstery sighed as it rose by degrees , erasing the dents they had left . She climbed the stairs to the sleeping quarters , where she 'd rarely been before . Girls were allowed here , but they did n't often come ; there was something uncouth about the place . A couple of boys were tossing a softball in the corridor . They paused grudgingly as she edged by , and the instant she had passed , she heard the slap of the ball again just behind her . She knocked at the door of 241 . Leon 's roommate said , " Yeah . " " It 's Emily Cathcart . Can I come in and get some things for Leon ? " " Sure . " He was seated at his desk , tilted back , apparently doing nothing but shooting paper clips with a rubber band . ( How would she ever love another boy after Leon left ? ) The paper clips kept hitting a bulletin board and then pinging into the metal wastebasket underneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Emily said . " Under that bed . " She dragged it out . It was covered with dust . " Meredith leaving us ? " he asked . " He 's going to New York . Do n't tell his parents . " " New York , eh ? " said the roommate , without much interest . From the closet by Leon 's bed Emily started taking the clothes she 'd seen him wear most often  --  white shirts , khakiMORGAN 'S PASSINGtrousers , a corduroy jacket she knew he was fond of . Everythingsmelled of him , starchy and clean . She was pleased by the length of his trousers , in which she herself would be lost . " You going with him ? " the roommate said . " I do n't think he wants me to . " Another paper clip snapped against the bulletin board . " I would if he asked me , but he has n't , " Emily said . " Oh , well , you 've got exams coming up . Got to get yourA 's and A-pluses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " The man wants to travel light , I guess . " " Is this his bureau ? " He nodded and let his chair thud forward . " You do n't think your picture 'd be on my bureau , " he said . " No offense , of course . " She glanced at the picture  --  her Christmas present to Leon . It stood behind an alarm clock , still in the deckle-edged cardboardfolder supplied by the studio . The person it showed only faintly resembled her , she hoped . Emily hated being made to feel conscious of her physical appearance . She walked around most of the time peering out of the eye holes of her body without giving it much thought , and she found it an unpleasant shock to be pressed onto a piano bench with her head held at an unnatural angle , forced to reflect upon her too light skin and her pale lashes that had a way of disappearingin photographs . " Smile , " the photographer had told her . " This is not a firing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick , nervous smile and felt how artificially her lips stretched across her teeth . When the man ducked behind his camera , she 'd wiped the smile off instantly . Her face emerged sober and peering , netted by worry , the mouth slightly pursed like her spinster aunt 's . She did n't pack the photo . And when she got back to Leon at the fountain , she was lugging not only his suitcase but hers as well . " I do n't care what you say , " she told him . She started calling this at some distance from him , she was so anxious to69get it said . She was puffing and tottering between the two suitcases . " I 'm coming with you . You ca n't leave me here ! " " Emily ? " " I think we ought to get married . Living in sin would be inconvenient , " she said , " but if that 's what you prefer , then I 'd do that too . And if you tell me not to come , I 'll come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save your breath . I 'll ride on the bus one seat behind you . I 'll tell the taxi driver , Follow that cab ! ' I 'll tell the hotel clerk , Give me the room next to his room , please . ' " Leon laughed . She saw she 'd won him . She set down the suitcases and stood facing him , not smiling herself . In fact , what she 'd won him with was a deliberate , calculated spunkinessthat she really did not possess , and she was alarmed to find him so easily taken in . Or maybe he was n't taken in at all , but knew that this was what the audience expected : that when some girl chases you down with her suitcase and behaves outrageously , you 're to laugh and throw your hands up and surrender . Laughter was not his best expression . She had never seen him look so disjointed , so uneven . There was somethingasymmetrical about his face . " Emily , " he said , " what am I going to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told him . Already she was beginning to worry about that herself . By evening they were on a Greyhound bus to New York City . By the next afternoon they were settled ( it felt more like camping out ) in a furnished room with a sink in one corner and a toilet down the hall . They were married Thursday , which was as soon as the law permitted . She 'd seen more ceremony , Emily thought , when she got her driver 's license . Marriage did n't cause as much of a jolt in her life as she 'd expected . Emily found a job as a waitress in a Polish restaurant . Leon  --  just for the moment  --  cleaned a theatre after shows . In the early evenings he hung out at various coffee-houses listening to actors and poets give readings . He took Emily along , whenever she did n't have to work . " Are n't they terMORGAN'SPASSINGrible ? " he would ask her . " I can do better than that . " Emily thought so too . Once they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leon got up and walked out , and the actor stopped halfway through a line to say , " Hey , you ! Do n't forget to leave some money in the cup . " Emily would have done it  --  she 'd do anything to avoid a scene  --  but Leon got angry . She felt him draw in his breath ; he seemed to grow bigger . By now she knew how far his anger could take him . She lifted her hand to form the shape of his elbow , but she did n't actually touch him . You should never touch Leon when his temper was up . Then he let go of his breath again and allowed her to lead him away , with the actor still shouting after them . It turned into a very hot summer , full of rainstorms and muggy black clouds . The heat in their room was like somethingalive . And they were continually on the brink of having no money whatsoever . Emily had never realized how much money mattered . She felt she had to breathe shallowly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she sidled between people who were richer . She and Leon began to fight about how to spend what they did have . He was more extravagant  --  wasteful , she said . He said she was stingy . In July , Emily had a scare and thought she might be pregnant . She felt trapped and horrified ; she did n't dare tell Leon . So when she found she was n't pregnant after all , she could n't share her relief with him , either . She kept that experience in her mind . She kept examining it , trying to make sense of it . What kind of marriage was it if you could n't tell your husband a thing like that ? But he would have flown into a rage , and then sunk in on himself like over-risen bread . It was her idea , marrying , he 'd say ; and she was the one alwaysharping on what they could n't afford . She pictured the scene so clearly that she almost believed it had happened . She held it against him . Her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd behaved . But he had n't ! He had never been given a chance ! ( he would say ) . She went on blaminghim anyhow . She visited a family-planning clinic and she7ttold them that her husband would kill her if she ever got pregnant . Of course she meant it figuratively , but she could tell from the way the social worker looked at her that in this neighborhood you could n't always be sure of that . The social worker glanced at Emily 's arms and asked her if she had any other problems . Emily wanted to talk about her separateness , about how she 'd kept her pregnancy scare a secret from her own husband , but she knew that was n't a serious enough problem . In this neighborhood , women were getting murdered . ( She felt how frivolous she must seem to the social worker ; she was wearing her leotard and wrap skirt from Modern Dance I. ) Women were getting mugged in this neighborhood , or beaten up by their husbands . Emily 's husband would never lay a finger on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a circle of immunity , she felt . She herself was not an angry kind of person . The most she could manage was a little spark of delayed resentment , every now and then , when something had happened earlier that she really should have objected to if she 'd only realized . Maybe if she 'd had a temper herself , she would have known what string would pull Leon back down into calm . As it was , she just had to stand by . She had to remind herself : " He might hurt other people , but he 's never laid a finger on me . " This gave her a little flicker of pleasure . " He 's crazy sometimes , " she told the social worker , " but he 's never harmed a hair of my head . " Then she smoothed her skirt and looked down at her white , bloodless hands . In August , Leon met up with four actors who were formingan improvisational group called Off the Cuff . One of them had a van ; they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York is too hard to break into , " the girl named Paula said . ) Leon joined them . From the start he was their very best member , Emily thought  --  otherwise they might not have let him in , with his deadwood wife who froze in public and would only take up space in the van . " I can build sets , at least , " Emily told them , but it seemed they never used sets . They acted on a bare stage . They planned toMORGAN 'S PASSINGget up in front of a nightclub audience and request ideas that they could extemporize upon . The very thought terrified Emily , but Leon said it was the finest training he could hope to have . He practiced with them at the apartment of Barry May , the boy who owned the van . There was no way they could truly rehearse , of course , but at least they could practiceworking together , sending signals , feeding each other lines that propelled them toward some sort of ending . They were planning on comedy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else in a nightclub . They built their comedy upon situations that made Emily anxious  --  lost luggage , a dentist gone berserk  --  and while she watched she wore a small , quirked frown that never really left her , even when she laughed . In fact it was terrible to lose your luggage . ( She 'd once had it actually happen . She 'd lain awake all one night before it was recovered . ) And it was much too easy to imagineyour dentist going berserk . She chewed on a knuckle , observing how Leon took over the stage with his wide , crisp gestures , his swinging stride that came from the hip . In one skit he was Paula 's husband . In another he was her fiance . He kissed her on the lips . It was only acting , but who knows : sometimes you act like a certain person long enough , you become that person . Was n't it possible ? They started on tour in September . They left New York in the van with all their worldly goods piled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat suitcases and the fluted silver coffeepot that Aunt Mercer had sent for a wedding gift . They went first to Philadelphia , where Barry knew a boy whose uncle owned a bar . For three nights they played out their skits in front of an audience that did not stop talking once , and they had to cull their ideas from Emily , whom they 'd fed a few suggestions and planted on a barstool just in case . Then they moved on to Haightsville , south of Philadelphia . They thought they had a connection there , but that fell through , and they ended up in a tavern called the Bridle Club that was decorated to look like a stable . Emily had the impression that most of the customers were married to other73people waiting at home . It was a middle-aged crowd  --  squat men in business suits , women with sprayed and gilded hair and dresses that looked one size too small . These people , too , talked among themselves throughout the skits , but they did offer a few ideas . A man wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was quitting school to become an exotic dancer . A woman proposed that a couple have a quarrel about the wife 's attempts to introduce a few gourmet foods to her husband . Both of these suggestions , when they were made , caused a little ripple of amusement through the room , and the group turned them into fairly funny skits ; but Emily kept imagining that they might be true . The man did have the seedy , desolate look of a failed father ; the woman was so frantically gay that she could very well have just escaped from a stodgy husband . What the audience was doing was handing over its pain , Emily felt . Even the laughter seemed painful , issuing from these men with their red , bunchy faces and the women bearing up bravely beneath their towering burdens of hair . For the third skit , a man sitting with three other men proposed the following : a wife develops the notion that her husband , a purely social drinker who can take it or leave it and quit whenever he wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact an alcoholic . " Pretend like this woman gets more and more out of line , " he said . " Pretend like she goes around watering the Jack Daniel 's , calling up the doctor and the AA people . When he asks for a drink , she brings him ginger ale with a spoonful of McCormick 's brandy extract stirred in . When he wants to go out for a friendly night with his buddies , she says  --  " " Please ! " said Barry , holding up a hand . " Leave something for us ! " Then everyone laughed , except Emily . They were appearing at the Bridle Club for three nights , but the second night Emily did n't go . She walked around town instead , until almost ten o'clock , looking into the darkenedwindows of Kresge and Lynne 's Dress Shoppe and Knitter 's World . Periodically , carloads of teenagers shot by , MORGAN 'S PASSINGhooting at her , but Emily ignored them . She felt so much older than they were , she was surprised she was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only place still open , she bought a zippered cosmetic kit for traveling , completely fitted with plastic jars and bottles and a tiny tube of Pepsodent . She and Leon were almost penniless at this point . They were having to sleep apart  --  Emily and the two other women at the Y , the men in the van . The last thing they could afford was a $4.98 cosmetic kit . Emily rushed back to her room , feeling guilty and pleased . She started rearranging her belongings  --  carefullypouring hand lotion into one of the bottles , fitting her silver hairbrush into a vinyl loop . But she really did n't wear much make-up ; the zippered bag took more room than her few cosmetics had taken on their own . It was a mistake . She could n't even get her money back ; she 'd used the bottles . She began to feel sick . She went through her suitcasethrowing things out  --  her white school blouses , her jeans , every bit of underwear . ( If she wore only leotards , she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that remained in her suitcase were two extra wrap skirts , two extra leotards , a nightgown , and the cosmetic bag . The small cardboard wastebasket next to her bed was overflowing with filmy , crumpled , shoddy non-essentials . Their third appearance at the Bridle Club was canceled in favor of the owner 's cousin 's girlfriend , a torch singer . " I did n't know there still were such things , " Leon told Emily . He looked depressed . He said he was n't sure this experience was as valuable as he 'd once believed . But Barry May , who was more or less the leader of the group , refused to give up . He wanted to try Baltimore , which was full of bars , he said . Besides , one of the other members , Victor Apple , had a mother living in Baltimore , and they ought to be able to get a free place to stay . Emily knew as soon as they arrived that Baltimore would not work out . Although they drove through miles and miles of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city continued75to strike her as narrow and confining : all those gloomy rowhouses , some no wider than a single room ; those alleys choked with discarded tires and bottles and bedsprings ; those useless-looking , hopeless men slumped on their stoops . But she took to Victor 's mother immediately . Mrs. Apple was a tall , cheerful , striding woman with clipped gray hair and a leathery face . She owned a shop called Crafts Unlimited , as well as the building that housed it , and various craftsmen filled her apartments , some paying only token rent until they could get on their feet . She gave the acting group a third-floor apartment , unfurnished and shabby but clean . It was split by a dark hall , with a living room and a bedroom on one side and a kitchen and a second bedroom on the other side . At the end of the hall was an antique bathroom , against whose window , long ago , the adjoining building had been constructed . You could stand at that window and see nothing but a sheet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this comforting . It was the only view she had felt sure of lately . It seemed to her now that adjusting to new places used up pieces of a person . Large chunks of her had been broken off and left behind in New York , in Philadelphia , in Haightsville  --  anyplace she had painstakingly set out her mother 's silverbackedcomb and brush on someone else 's peeling bureau and contrived a pretense of familiarity with someone else 's flaking walls and high , cracked ceiling . She followed Mrs. Apple everywhere ; she could n't help herself . She dusted the carvingsand the handmade furniture down in the shop and she learned how to work the cash register . She waited on customersduring busy periods  --  not for pay , but for the sunny smell of new wood and freshly woven fabrics , and the brisk , offhand friendliness of Mrs. Apple . Emily and Leon slept in the front bedroom , in two sleepingbags . Victor spread his tangle of blankets in a corner of the living room . Barry and Paula and Janice slept in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up trying to figure that out . ) In the daytime Barry went looking for jobs whileMORGAN 'S PASSINGthe others stayed home and played cards . They no longer practiced their skits or even mentioned them ; but sometimes , watching them play poker , Emily had the feeling that to these people everything was a skit . When they lost , they groaned and tore their hair . When they won , they leaped up , flinging their cards to the ceiling , and trumpeted , " Ta-taa ! " and took a bow . Their vowels were broader than most people 's , and they italicized so much . You had to talk like that yourself sometimes , just to be heard above the din . Emily found herselfchanging . She heard herself coming down hard on her words , drawing them out . She caught sight of herself in a mirror once , unexpectedly  --  her small , dry face as wan as a ghost 's , but one arm flung out grandly as if she were standing cloaked and hatted in the center of some stage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars in Baltimore were not the kind to want plays going on . They were drinking bars , Barry said , and this was a drinkingcity . At one place he would have had to step over a flatoutbody , either unconscious or dead , in the doorway ; but he had n't seen much point , he said , in applying there . A week passed , and then two weeks . They were living on a cheap brand of water-packed tuna , and Mrs. Apple had stopped inviting them so frequently to supper . Their greasepaint box somehow fell apart . Tubes of ghastly pink flesh-tone , like fat sticks of chalk , rolled into corners and stayed there , sendingout their flowery old-lady smell . Janice and Paula stopped speaking to each other , and Janice moved her sleeping bag to the kitchen . Then Barry found a job , but only for himself . A friend of a friend was putting on his own play . Emily was n't there when he announced it . She 'd been helping out at Crafts Unlimited . All she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packing his knapsack . A swelling was rising on his lower lip , and Leon was gone . The others sat on the floor , watching Barry roll up his jeans with shaky hands . " That husband of yours is insane , " he told Emily . Even his voice shook . Emily said , " What happened ? " and the others all started77talking at once . It was n't Barry 's fault , they said ; you have to watch out for number one in this world ; what did Leon expect ? Emily never did sort out the particulars , but she grasped the main idea . She was surprised at how little it bothered her . There was something satisfying about the damage done to Barry 's lip . The skin had split where the swelling was highest ; she was reminded of an overripe plum . " Oh , well , " she said , " I suppose it 's for the best . " " Mark my words , " Barry told her , " you 're living with a dangerous man . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh , he would never harm me , " Emily said . She could n't think why Barry was taking this so seriously . Did n't it often happen in these people 's lives  --  drama , extravagant gestures ? She removed some hairpins from her hair and pinned her braids higher on her head . The others watched her . She felt graceful and light-hearted . Janice and Paula went back to New York ; Janice planned to accept an old marriage proposal . " I just hope the offer 's still open , " she said . Emily had no idea what Paula was going to do , and she did n't care , either . She was tired of living in a group . She got on fine with them , right to the end , and she said goodbye to them politely enough , but underneath she felt chafed by every word they uttered . That left Victor . Victor was n't so bad . He was only seventeen , and he seemed even younger . He was a slight , stooped , timid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longed to shave off . Once the others were gone , he moved his blankets to the rear bedroom . He showed up for meals looking shy and hopeful . It was a little like having a son , Emily thought . By now they were completely out of money , so Emily started work as a paid assistant at Crafts Unlimited . Leon found a part-time job at Texaco , pumping gas . Victor just borrowed from Mrs. Apple . Mrs. Apple lent him the money , but gave out lectures with it . She wanted him to go back to school , or at least take the high-school-equivalency test . She threatened to send him to live with his father , whom Emily had always assumed to be dead . After these lectures VictorMORGAN 'S PASSINGwould slink around the apartment kicking baseboards . Emily commiserated with him , but she did think Mrs. Apple had a point . She could n't understand how things had gone this far , even ; everyone seemed to be living lives without shape , without backbone . " When you think of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother ever let you go to New York in the first place . Really , she 's a very . . . surprising woman . " " Sure , to you , " said Victor . " Other people 's mothers alwayslook so nice . Up close , they 're strict and grabby and they do n't have a sense of humor . " Then Mrs. Apple came to Emily with an idea . ( She probablyfelt that if she came to Victor , he 'd turn it down automatically . ) If they were so set on acting , she said , why not act at children 's birthday parties ? They could put an ad in the paper , get a telephone , borrow her Singer sewing machineto stitch a few costumes together . Mothers could call and order " Red Riding Hood " or " Rapunzel . " ( Emily would make a lovely Rapunzel , with her long blond hair . ) They would gladly pay a good fee , she was certain , since birthday parties were such a trial . Emily passed the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would not , at least , freeze up onstage in front of a few small children . Victor was immediately willing , but Leon looked doubtful . " Just the three of us ? " he asked . " We could change costumes a lot . And there are always people around here , if we 're really stuck for more charac-ters . " " We could use my mother for a witch , " Victor said . " Well , I do n't know , " Leon said . " I would n't even call that acting , if you want to know the truth . " " Oh , Leon . " She dropped the subject for the next few days . She watched him weighing it in his mind . He came back from the Texaco station with his hands black , smearing black on the doorknobs and the switchplates . Even after he washed , black79stayed in the creases of his skin and rimmed his fingernails . Sitting on the kitchen counter waiting for his tuna , he spread his hands on his knees and studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them again . Finally he said , " These children 's plays , I suppose they 'd do for a stopgap . " Emily said nothing . He said , " It would n't hurt to give it a try , just so we do n't get stuck in it . " Now , all this time Emily and Victor had been laying their plans , they 'd been so sure he would change his mind . They 'd already ordered a phone for the kitchen . It arrived the day after Leon gave in . They placed an ad in the papers and they made a large yellow poster to hang in Crafts Unlimited . Rapunzel , Cinderella , Red Riding Hood , the poster read . Or .. . you name it . ( " Just so it does n't take a cast of thousands , " Leon said . ) Then they sat back and waited . Nothing happened . On the sixth day a woman phoned to ask if they gave puppetshows . " I do n't need a play ; I need a puppet show , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about puppets . She does n't like plays at all . " " Well , I 'm sorry  --  " Emily said . " Last year I had Peter 's Puppets come and she loved them , and all they charged was thirty-two dollars , but now I hear they 've moved to  --  " " Thirty-two dollars ? " Emily asked . " Four dollars a child , for seven guests and Melissa . I felt that was reasonable ; do n't you ? " " It 's more than reasonable , " Emily said . " For a puppet show we get five per child . " " Goodness , " the woman said . " Well , I suppose we could uninvite the Maclntosh children . " In the two weeks before the party Emily borrowed Mrs. Apple 's sewing machine and put together a Beauty , two sisters , a father , and a Beast , who was really just a fake fur mittenwith eyes . She chose " Beauty and the Beast " because itMORGAN 'S PASSINGwas her favorite fairytale . Victor said he liked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as far as he was concerned , this was just another version of the Texaco job . He hardly noticedwhen Emily came prancing up to him with her hand transformed into Beauty . She cut a stage from a cardboard box , and bought gauzy black cloth for the scrim . She and Victor clowned together , putting on doll-like voices to match the puppets ' round faces . They had the two sisters sing duets and waltz on the kitchen windowsill . Leon just looked grim . He had figured out that most of their fee had already been spent on materials . " This is not going to make us rich , " he said . " But think of next time , " Emily said , " when we 'll already be equipped . " " Oh , Emily , let 's not have a next time . " On the day of the party  --  a rainy winter afternoon  --  they loaded everything into Victor 's mother 's car and drove north to Mrs. Tibbett 's stucco house in Homeland . Mrs. Tibbett led them through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Leon and Victor arranged the cardboard stage on a Ping-Pong table . Meanwhile Emily unpacked the puppets . Then she and Victor set the two sister puppets to whispering and snickering , trying to get Leon to join in . He was supposed to work the Beast , which he 'd never even fitted on his hand ; and he 'd had to be told the plot during the drive over . He claimed the only fairytale he knew was " Cinderella . " Now he ignored the puppets and paced restlessly up and down , sometimes pausing to lift a curtain and peer out into the garden . It was because of his parents , Emily thought . This house resembled his parents ' house , which Emily had once visited during semester break . The living room had that same stiff , icy quality , with the pale rugs that no one seemed to have walked on and the empty vases , the ticking silence , the satin striped chairs , where obviously no children were ever allowed to sit . Mrs. Tibbett , even , was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hair streaked , her mouth tight , with8isomething unhappy beneath her voice if Leon would only hear it . Emily reached out to pat his arm , but then stopped herself and curled her fingers in . The doorbell rang  --  a whole melody . " It 's a goddamned cathedral , " Leon muttered . The first guests arrived , and MelissaTibbett , a thin-faced , homely child in blue velvet , went to greet them . These children were all five years old or just turning six , Mrs. Tibbett had said . They were young enough to come too early , with their party clothes already sliding toward ruin , but old enough , at least , not to cling tearfully to the birthday presents they 'd brought . Emily supervised the opening of the presents . Mrs. Tibbett had vanished , and the two men seemed to think that dealing with the children was Emily 's job . She learned the names that mattered  --  the troublemaker ( Lisa ) and the shy one who hid in corners ( Jennifer ) . Then she settled them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . Emily was each of the daughters in turn . Concealed behind the scrim , she did n't feel much stage fright . " What do you want me to bring you , daughter ? " Victor squeaked . " Bring me a casket of pearls , Father , " Emily piped in a tiny voice . Leon rolled his eyes toward the ceiling . " What do you want me to bring you , Beauty ? " " Only a rose , Father . One perfect rose . " She could see the outlines of the children through the scrim . They were listening , but they were fidgety underneath , she thought . It made her nervous . She felt things were on the verge of falling into pieces . During the father 's long scene alone in the palace , she saw Mrs. Tibbett 's fluttery silhouette enter and stand watching . What a shame ; she 'd come during the dull part . " Oh . A table has been laid for me , with lovely foods , " the father said . " And look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder to whom this belongs . " Mrs. Tibbett shifted her weight to the other foot . MORGAN 'S PASSINGThen the Beast arrived . Emily expected him to roar , but instead he spoke in a deep , chortling growl that took her by surprise . " Who 's gobbled up all my food ? " he asked plaintively . " Who 's been sleeping in my bed ? " ( Oh , Lord , she hoped he had n't confused this with " Goldilocks . " ) " My lovely bed , with the satin sheets to keep my hairdo smooth ! " he groaned . The children laughed . An audience . She saw him realize . She saw the Beast raise his shaggy head and look toward the children . Their outlines were still now and their faces were craned forward . " Do you know who ? " he asked them . " Him ! " they cried , pointing . " What 's that you say ? " " The father ! Him ! " The Beast turned slowly . " Oho ! " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blown by the Beast 's hot breath . After the show the maid passed cake and punch around , but most of the children were too busy with the puppets to eat . Emily taught them how to work the Beast 's mouth , and she had Beauty sing " Happy Birthday " to Melissa . Mrs. Tibbettsaid , " Oh , this was so much better than last year 's Punch and Judy . ' " " We never do Punch and Judy , ' " Leon said gravely . " It 's too grotesque . We stick to fairytales . " " Just one thing puzzles me , " said Mrs. Tibbett . " What 's that ? " " Well , the Beast . He never changed to a prince . " Leon glanced over at Emily . " Prince ? " Emily said . " You had her living happily ever after with the Beast . But that 's not how it is ; he changes ; she says she loves him and he changes to a prince . " " Oh , " Emily said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think how she 'd forgotten . " Well . . . " she said . " But I guess that would take too many puppets . " 83 " No , " Emily said , " it 's just that we use a more authentic version . " " Oh , I see , " Mrs. Tibbett said. 3 By spring they were putting on puppet shows once or twice a week , first for friends of Mrs. Tibbett 's and then for friends of those friends . ( In Baltimore , apparently , word of mouth was what counted most . ) They made enough money so they could start paying Mrs. Apple rent , and Leon quit his Texaco job . Emily went on working at Crafts Unlimitedjust because she enjoyed it , but she earned almost as much now from the extra puppets that she sold there . And gradually they began to be invited to school fairs and church fund-raisers . Emily had to sit up all one night , hastily sewing little Biblical costumes . A private school invited them to give a show on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leon . " What is there to say ? " But Leon invented a character named Murky Mouth , a wicked little soul who stuffed on sweets , ran water over his toothbrush to deceive his mother , and played jump-rope with his dental floss . Eventually , of course , he came to a bad end , but the children loved him . Two more schools sent invitations the following week , and a fashionable pedodontist gave them fifty dollars to put on a Saturday-morning show for twenty backsliding patients and their mothers , who ( Emily heard later ) had to pay twentyfivedollars per couple to attend . It was mostly Leon 's doing , their success . He still grumbled any time they had a show , but the fact was that from the start he knew exactly what was needed : dignified , eccentric little characters ( no more squeaky voices ) and plenty of audience participation . His heroes were always dropping things and wondering where they were , so that the children went wild trying to tell them ; always overlooking the obMORGAN'SPASSINGvious and having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , cared more for the puppets themselves . She liked the designing and the sewing and the scrabbling for stray parts . She loved the moment when a puppet seemed to come to life  --  usually just after she 'd sewed the eyes on . Once made , a puppet had his own distinct personality , she found . It could n't be altered or submerged , and it could n't be duplicated . If he was irreparably damaged  --  or stolen , which sometimes happened  --  she could only make a new one to fill his role ; she could n't make the same one over again . That was ridiculous , Leon said . She imagined the world split in two : makers and doers . She was a maker and Leon was a doer . She sat home and put togetherpuppets and Leon sprang onstage with them , all flair and action . It was only a matter of circumstance that she also had to be the voices for the heroines . Victor was neither maker nor doer , or he was both , or somewhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Victor ? First he grew so quiet , and paused before answering anything she said , as if having to reel his mind in from more important matters . He moped around the apartment ; he stared at Emily sadly while he stroked his wisp of a mustache . When Emily asked him what his trouble was , he told her he 'd been born in the wrong year . " How can that be ? " she asked him . She supposed he 'd taken up some kind of astrology . " What difference does the year make ? " " It does n't bother you ? " " Why should it bother me ? " He nodded , swallowing . That night at supper he put down his plate of baked beans and stood up and said , " There 's something I have to say . " They still had no furniture , and he 'd been eating on the windowsill . He stood in front of the window , framed by an orange sunset so they had to squint at him from their places on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back so the knuckles cracked . " I have never been a sneaky85person , " he said . " Leon , I 'd like to announce that I 'm in love with Emily . " Leon said , " Huh ? " " I wo n't beat around the bush : I think you 're wrong for her . You 're such a grouch . You 're always so angry and she 's so . . . un-angry . You think her puppets are nothing , a chore , something forced on you till you get to your real thing , acting . But if you 're an actor , why do n't you act ? You think there 's no theatre groups in this city ? I know why : you had a fight with that guy Bronson , Branson , what's-his-name , when you went to try out . You 've had a fight with everyone around . You ca n't try out for the Chekhov play because Barry May 's in that and he 'll tell all the others what you 're like . But still you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so held back , wasting your talents here when there 's other things you could be doing . What other things ? " Leon had stopped chewing . Emily felt her chest tightening up . Victor was smaller than Leon , and so young and meek he would never hit back . She imagined him cowering against the window , shielding his head with his arms , but she did n't know how to step in and stop this . " I realize I 'm not as old as Emily , " Victor said , " but I could take much better care of her . I would treat her better ; I 'd appreciate her ; I 'd sit admiring her all day long , if you want to know . We 'd live a real life , not like this , with her ducked over her sewing machine and you off brooding in some corner , paying her no attention , holding some grudge that no one can guess at . . . Well , I 'll say it right out : I want to take Emily away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She saw that he was n't angry at all . He was relaxed and amused , smiling a tolerant , kindly smile . " Well , Emily ? " he said . " Do you want to go away with Victor ? " She felt suddenly flattened . " Thank you , Victor , " she said , pressing her palms together . " It 's nice of you , but I 'm fine as I am , thank you . " MORGAN 'S PASSING " Oh , " said Victor . " I appreciate the thought . " " Well , " Victor said , " I did n't want to sneak around about it . " Then he sat back down on the windowsill and picked up his plate of beans . The next morning he was gone  --  Victor and his tangle of blankets and his canvas backpack and his cardboard carton of LP records . He had n't even said goodbye to Mrs. Apple . Well , it was a relief , in a way . How could they act natural after that ? And she and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a married couple ; it began to seem that they really were married . She was starting to think about a baby . Leon did n't want one , but in time he would come around . They could use Victor 's room for a workshop now , and then for the baby later on . It was lucky Victor had left , in fact . But she hated how his woodsy , brown boy-smell hung in the empty room for days after he had gone . Several times in Emily 's life , similar things had happened . Men had seemed to affix themselves to her  --  but not to her personally , she thought . What they liked was their idea of her . She remembered a boy in her logic class who used to write her notes asking if she would take down her hair for him . Her hair : a bunch of dead cells that had nothing to do with her . " Think of it as longer , thinner fingernails , " she had written back coolly . She disliked being seen from outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an oldfashionedface . Once , in New York , a man had started eating every day at the restaurant where she worked , and any time she so much as passed his table he would tell her about his ex-wife , who had also worn braids on top of her head . It was a continuing story : Emily would bring his rolls and he would say , " On our second date we went to the zoo . " She 'd refill his coffee cup and he would say , " I 'm pretty certain she loved me to begin with . " After a couple of weeks he went away , but Emily could n't forget the ex-wife . She was Emily 's other self ; they would have understood each other , but she87had slipped off and left Emily to take the blame . Now , with Victor , Emily wondered who he 'd had in mind . Not Emily , she was sure  --  poking around in her linty old clothes , huntingup noses for her puppets . It must have been someone else who looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people in her life . Poor Victor ! It was a pity , Emily thought . She was surprised at how much she missed him . She could not imagine loving anyone but Leon , but when she 'd put a puppet together and longed for someone to try him out on , she thought of Victor and their squeaky-voiced duets . She remembered Beauty 's sisters clowning around at that first birthday party while Leon paced the floor . It was n't so easy to clown around with Leon. 4 She dressed Gina in a T-shirt , pink corduroy overalls , and a snowsuit . She buckled her little red shoes on her feet . Gina was impatient to get going . " Can we swing on the swings ? " she asked . " Not today , honey . " " But I want to swing on the swings . " " Maybe tomorrow . " " Why ca n't we swing on the swings ? " She was almost two now . Terrible Two 's : they had minds all their own . But that could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one small child kept both of her parents continuallyoccupied and teetering on the edge of exhaustion . They must be doing something wrong . It did n't look so hard for other people . Emily put a coat on and tied a scarf over her hair . It was February , a damp , cold day . Even the apartment was cold . She poked her head into the kitchen to say goodbye to Leon . He was sitting at the chipped enamel table they 'd bought from Goodwill , reading the Village Voice . " Leon ? " she said . " I 'm taking Gina for a walk . " " You want me to come along ? " MORGAN 'S PASSING " Oh , no , I 'll be back soon . " He nodded and returned to his paper . Emily led Gina out the door . They went down the creaking stairway , past the side entrance of Crafts Unlimited , through the glass door at the front of the building . She checked the laundromat across the street . No one was there . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue . Gina kept struggling to get down ; she liked to go places under her own steam . ( It took her all day . ) By now she was so heavy that it was difficult to hold on to her . Emily went faster than she 'd intended to , pulled forward by Gina 's tilted weight . Her slippers made a rustling , patting sound . They arrived at the E-Z Cafeteria five minutes early , but Leon 's mother was already waiting , seated alertly at the foremosttable with her hands crossed over her purse . When she saw Emily ( when she saw Gina , really ) , she seemed to open like a flower . Her face lifted , her hands uncrossed themselves , and the feathers on her hat stirred . " Ah ! " she cried . She rose and brushed her cheek against Emily 's . " I was n't sure you 'd come , " she told Emily . " I did n't know if you 'd want to bring her out in this weather . " " Oh , she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meredith settled Gina in the high chair she 'd already wheeled up . " Was she cold ? " she crooned . " Did her little face get frozen ? " She unwrapped her like a package , and patted Gina 's thick , dark hair . " Oh , exactly like Leon 's hair , " she said . ( She always did . ) " Will you look at how she 's grown ? Just in this one month she 's grown so that I never would have known her . Though of course I 'd know her anywhere , " she said , contradicting herself . Gina gazed at her reflectively . She was always quieter in her grandmother 's presence . The E-Z Cafeteria was not Mrs. Meredith 's style , but it was one place they could manage Gina . They could wheel her down the food line instead of waiting for their order to arrive , and they could leave without delay any time she got restless . It had taken them a while to figure this out . They 'd started off at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to which Emily had had to travel by bus . It was the only Baltimore restaurant Mrs. Meredith knew of . And , to be fair , she 'd had no idea she was inviting a baby to lunch as well . What had happened was , when Emily got married she had naturally informed her Great-Aunt Mercer , back in Taney . Aunt Mercer had not been very pleased , but she 'd made the best of it . On her thick , silver-rimmed stationery , which smelled as if she 'd kept it in her basement for the last ten years , she wrote to ask Emily who this young Meredith might be . What 's his daddy 's name ? Would I be likely to know any of his people ? He is n't one of those Nashville Merediths , is he ? And once she had her answers , of course she felt duty-bound to write his parents a get-acquainted note . Next Leon received a letter from his mother , sent direct to his New York address : Mr. Leon Meredith . No mention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Leon ! " Emily said . It was true she was n't comfortable with his parents , but you could n't just discard your only relatives . Leon said , " I told you that was a mistake , writing your aunt . I said it would be . " And the letter stayed in the wastebasket . They moved to Baltimore , but the letters followed , for all his mother had to do was ask Aunt Mercer for his new address . And Leon went on throwing the letters away . Maybe eventually he 'd have opened one ( this could n't last forever , could it ? ) , but then the Merediths did something unforgivable . They gave his forwarding address to his draft board . It was n't malicious , Emily was certain , but Leon thought it was . " That 's my parents for you , " he said . " They 'd rather have me dead in the jungle than alive and happy without them . " He went on cursing them even after he failed the physical . One leg was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , the result of a broken thighbone in his childhood . No one had ever noticed it before . He returned with a painful limp and said , " I 'm free , but I wo n't forget what they tried to do to me . " And he continued throwing their letters away . MORGAN 'S PASSINGIf Emily 's name had been on the envelopes too , she 'd have opened them . She was pregnant by then and wishing for her mother . Aunt Mercer was no use  --  with her dim , steely handwriting : The crocuses are late this year and the rodents have been at my galanthus bulbs  --  and Mrs. Apple was sympathetic but had no recollection of childbirth . ( " Perhaps I was put to sleep , " she said . " Do they give anesthesia for such things ? I may have been asleep the whole nine months , in fact . " ) Emily dreamed that Mrs. Meredith would suddenly arrive in person , miraculously plumper and more motherly , and she 'd fold Emily into her lap and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . Then , three months after Gina 's birth , there it was : Mrs. Leon Meredith . Emily marveled at how long it had taken . She smuggled the letter into the bathroom and locked the door behind her to read it . I know it must be you who 's keepingour boy from us . I saw from the start you were a cold little person . But he is our only child . Think how we must feel . Emily was stunned . She could n't believe that anyone would be so unfair . Her eyes blurred and the sheet of bricks shimmeredin the window . Why are you saying these things ? she wrote back . I have nothing to do with any of this and I do n't understand it . It 's between you and Leon . His mother said , It seems you must have taken offense at something . Please , could we start over ? Could we meet at the Elmwood this Wednesday at noon ? Emily did n't want to meet her . She felt like ripping the letter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her cardboard box , and she tried to imagine anything Gina could do  --  marrying , mismarrying , committing murder  --  that would sever her from Emily 's life as Leon had severed himselffrom his parents ' . There was nothing . She just would n't allow it . Gina was the whole point ; even what Emily felt for Leon seemed pallid by comparison . She smoothed the letter91on her lap and saw Mrs. Meredith 's tense , powdery face , with the eyebrows plucked as thin as two arched wires and the lids beneath them always a little puffed , as if she were on the edge of tears . There were certain rules , Emily had been taught . She would have to go just this once . Mrs. Meredith came by taxi , all the way from Richmond . Evidently , she did n't drive , and had simply hired a cab for the day . The driver sat at the next table , spreading pate on a cracker and reading Male magazine . Mrs. Meredith waited behind a foggy martini glass . Her back was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way she liked to in those days  --  hanging over Emily 's forearm , with her bottompropped against Emily 's hip , frowning darkly at her own bare toes . " Oh ! " Mrs. Meredith cried out , and one hand flew to her throat , knocking the martini glass into her lap . Now that she thought back , Emily felt she really should have prepared Mrs. Meredith . It was too theatrical  --  bursting in with an unannounced grandchild . It was more like somethingLeon would have done . She seemed to have caught some of Leon 's qualities . He seemed to have caught some of hers . ( He seldom spoke of moving on any more . ) She was reminded of those parking-lot accidents where one car 's fender grazes another 's . It had always puzzled her that on each fender , some of the other car 's paint appeared . You 'd think the paint would only be on one car , not both . It was as if they had traded colors . She tried to tell Leon about the lunch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually . " Your mother 's been writing me now , you know , " she said . But Leon said , " Emily , I do n't want to hear about it and I do n't want you to have anything to do with it . Is that clear ? " " All right , Leon , " Emily said . And , oddly enough , even Mrs. Meredith seemed content to let things be . It seemed she only wanted the connection ; just who made the connection did n't matter so much . SheM O R G A N ' S P A S S I N Gliked to hear from Emily what Leon was up to . Did he help to care for Gina ? " He walks her at night , and he baby-sits while I 'm working in the shop , " Emily told her , " but he ca n't yet bring himself to change a diaper . " " Exactly like Burt was , " Mrs. Meredith said . " Oh , exactly ! " But she never tried to press any closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were . She often retreatedinto stories about Leon 's childhood , when he had been someone she could understand . " He was a beautiful baby , " she said . " All the nurses told me so . Prettiest baby they 'd ever seen ! They could n't believe their eyes ! " Somehow , everything she said had a way of slipping out of her control . " Even the doctors stopped by to take a look . This one man , a heart surgeon , he came straight from an operation just to get a glimpse of him . Mrs. Meredith , ' he said , I never saw a baby so beautiful in my life . Yes , sir , we 're going to hear more of that young man . He 's going to amount to something someday ! ' He called his wife on the telephone ; I heard him in the hall . You ought to see this baby we 've got here ! Ought to see this baby ! ' " Next , Emily thought , there 'd be a star beaming over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so edgy around his mother . Mrs. Meredith 's rouged face , gazing brightly at a boy no one else could see , seemed deliberately shuttered and obstinate . In fact , she made Emily feel edgy as well , and Emily never enjoyed these lunches , or came any closer to liking Mrs. Meredith . Telling her a piece of news  --  or even speaking to Gina in Mrs. Meredith 's presence  --  Emily heard her own voice take on a fulsome tone that was n't hers at all . She felt that nothing she could say would ever live up to Mrs. Meredith'sexpectations . But what could she do ? The very day aftertheir lunch at the Elmwood , Mrs. Meredith started driving lessons . In a month she had her license and a brand-new Buick , and she drove the entire distance from Richmond to Baltimore although , she said , she was scared to death of multi-lane highways and disliked going over thirty miles per93hour . When she telephoned Emily from a corner booth , breathlessly announcing , " I did it ! I 'm here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " No , thank you , " and hang up ? They settled into a schedule : the first Wednesday of every month . Emily never told Leon about it . She knew that eventually , Gina would tell . Now that Gina could talk , it was only a matter of time . " When me and Grandma was eating . . . " she 'd say , and Leon would say , " You and who ? " and then all hell would break loose . Till then , Emily went dutifully to lunch , frowning slightly with concentration . One time Mr. Meredith came too . He seemed baffled by the baby . He let his wife do all the talking , while he stared around at the dingy old men slurping soup in the E-Z Cafeteria . " So where 's this son of mine ? " he asked finally . " He 's . . . very busy at home , " Emily said . " Would you believe he was once the size of this little tyke ? " he asked , jutting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the palm of my hand . Now we 're not on speaking terms . " " Burt , " said Mrs. Meredith . " He was always quick to throw things away . " Later , when it was time to go , he asked Emily if she had all her equipment . " Equipment ? " Emily said . " Equipment . You know . " Maybe he was asking if she were sane , marrying his son . But then he said , " Crib , playpen , high chair , carriage ... " " Oh . We do n't need all that , " Emily said . " She sleeps ina cardboard box . It 's perfectly comfortable . " " I 'll send her a crib , " Mr. Meredith said . " No , Mr. Meredith , please do n't do that . " " I 'll send her one tomorrow . Imagine ! A cardboard box ! " he said , and he went away shaking his head and looking pleased , as if his expectations , at least , had every one been fulfilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eyelet canopy . She 'd never heard of such nonsense . Two delivery men cameMORGAN 'S PASSINGpuffing up the stairs with it and leaned it , unassembled , against the wall in the hallway . She reached a finger inside a plastic bag and touched an eyelet ruffle . Then Leon walked in , tossingfrom hand to hand the cabbage she 'd asked him to get at the market . " What 's all this ? " he asked . " Your parents sent it , " she said . He took a step backward from the crib . " Leon , " she said . " While we 're on the subject , I ought to tell you something . " He said , " I do n't want to hear , I do n't want to know , and I want this monstrosity gone by the time I get back . " Then he turned and left , still carrying the cabbage . Emily thought it over . She mashed a banana for Gina 's supper and fed it to her , absently taking a few bites herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall , where the crib stood slanting elegantly . At that time Gina was six months old , and outgrowing her cardboard box . She slept more often with her parents , still munching drowsily on Emily'sbreast . It would be nice to have a safe container to keep her in , Emily thought . She scraped banana off Gina 's chin and stuffed it back into her mouth . She looked at the crib again . When Leon came back , the crib was still there , but he did n't mention it . Maybe he 'd been doing some thinking himself . The following day Emily started assembling it . She would join two pieces and then leave it a while , as if it were only something to fiddle with  --  a crossword puzzle , a hoop of needlework . Then she 'd come back and tighten a bolt ; then she 'd leaf through the paper . In a few days she had a completed crib . It seemed silly to leave it obstructing the hall , so she wheeled it into their bedroom . The effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room seem drab . Their mattress on the floor had a lumpy , beaten look . She went back to the hall for Gina and carried her into the bedroom and set her in the crib . Gina stared all around her at the eyelet ruffles , the decals , the bars . What a shock , she seemed to be saying . How did this imprisonment come about ? 95It came about inch by inch . These things just wear you down. 5 This child had changed their lives past recognition , more than they had dreamed possible . You would think that someone so small could simply be fitted into a few spare crannies and the world could go on as usual , but it was n't like that at all . From the start , she seemed to consume them . Even as a tiny infant she was aggressively sociable and noisy and enthusiastic , an insomniac who seldom took naps and struggled continually toward a vertical position . They would lay her down on her stomach for the night and instantly her head would bob up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her forehead seemed corrugated . She loved to be talked to , sung to , tossed in the air . As she grew older , she fell in love with Red Riding Hood 's wolf and they had to give him up to her . If she slept at all , she slept with the wolf against her cheek and she dreamily twisted his red felt tongue . Periodically the tongue fell off and then she would go to pieces  --  crying and clinging to Emily till Emily sewed it back on . And she hated to be left . Hannah Miles , across the hall , was glad to baby-sit , but any time Emily and Leon went out , Gina wept as if her heart would break and Emily would have to stay . Or Leon would make her leave anyway , really insist , and she would go , but her thoughts remained with Gina , and all through the movie or whatever she would fidget , buttoningand unbuttoning her coat , not hearing a word . Then Leon would be angry with her and they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but later when they returned , Gina would be wide awake and smiling , at eleven or twelve at night , reading books with Hannah and hardly noticing they were back . They never asked , of course , whether she was worth it . They centered their lives on her . They could marvel forever at the small , chilly point of her nose , or her fat-ringed fingersMORGAN 'S PASSINGor precisely cut mouth . When finally she fell asleep , the absenceof all that fierce energy made the apartment feel desolate . Emily would drift through the rooms not knowing what to do next , though she 'd wanted to do so much all day and never had a chance to begin . She wondered how they 'd managed to produce such a child . She herself had always been so subdued and so anxious to please ; Leon had Gina 's fire but none of her joyous good nature . Where did she get that ? She was a changeling . She had arrived with someone else 's qualities . She was the gnome 's baby , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat pulled low and he sank back into the darkness as they passed . Sometimesthe hat was pointed , sometimes flat , sometimes broadbrimmed . Sometimes it seemed he had aged , was slackening , falling apart as certain people suddenly do ; he was seen in gold-rimmed spectacles and his beard was cut to such a stubblethat he might merely have neglected shaving himself . Then later he would reappear miraculously young again , the spectacles gone , the beard in full bloom . On occasion he was not gnomish at all but just a rather beakish , distinguished gentleman in suits so tidy you had the impression someone else had dressed him . On other occasions he could have stepped into a puppet show and not been out of place . He had a gait they would know anywhere , that seemed to belong to someone much younger  --  a reckless , bent-kneed , lunging gait , half running , landing on the balls of his feet . But once he was seen plodding out of a secondhand-clothing store with the resigned deliberation of a middle-aged man , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straggled in an unkempt and pathetic way over the back of his collar . At Christmas , Leon thought he saw him at a puppet show all the way over near Washington ; but maybe it was just someone like him , he said . Then later he told Emily he 'd been stupid  --  not for thinking it was he ( the man was everywhere , after all ) , but for imaginingthere could be anyone else , anyplace , at any time , the faintest bit like Morgan. 19711 Morgan 's oldest daughter was getting married . It seemedhe had to find this out by degrees ; nobody actually toldhim . All he knew was that over a period of months one youngman began visiting more and more often , till soon a place wasset for him automatically at suppertime and he was consultedalong with the rest of the family when Bonny wanted toknow what color to paint the dining room . His name was Jim . He had the flat , beige face of a department-store mannequin , and he seemed overly fond of crew-necked sweaters . AndMorgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All he hadto do was look at this fellow and a peculiar kind of lassitudeMORGAN 'S PASSINGwould seep through him . Suddenly he would be struck by how very little there was in this world that was worth the effort of speech , the entanglements of grammar and pronunciationand sufficient volume of voice . Then Amy started beginning every sentence with " we . " We think this and we hope that . And finally : when we 're earning a little more money ; when we find a good apartment ; when we have children of our own . This just crept in , so to speak . No announcements were made . One Sunday afternoon Bonny asked Morgan if he thought the back yard was too small for the reception . " Reception ? " Morgan said . " And it 's not just the size ; it 's the weather , " Bonny said . " What if it rains ? You know how the weather can be in April . " " But this is already March , " Morgan said . " We 'll all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and come to some decision . " So Morgan went to his closet and chose an appropriate costume : a pinstriped suit he 'd laid claim to after Bonny 's father died . It stood out too far at the shoulders , maybe , but he thought it might have been what Mr. Cullen was wearing when Morgan asked him for permission to marry Bonny . And certainly he 'd been wearing his onyx cufflinks . Morgan found the cufflinks in the back of a drawer , and he spent some time struggling to slip them through the slick , starched cuffs of his only French-cuffed shirt . But when the four of them sat down for their discussion , no one consulted Morgan in any way whatsoever . All they talked about was food . Was it worthwhile calling in a caterer , or should they prepare the food themselves ? Amy thought a caterer would be simplest . Jim , however , preferred that things be homemade . Morgan wondered how he could say that , having eaten so many suppers here . Bonny was n't much of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it in any dish that she felt needed more zip . Everything they ate , almost , tasted like New York State cocktail sherry . Morgan sat in the rocking chair and plucked out his beard , 99strand by strand . If he got up right now and left , he told himself , they might not even notice . He reflected on a longstandinggrievance : there was one of Bonny 's pregnancies that she 'd forgotten to inform him about . It was the time she 'd been expecting Liz , or maybe Molly . Bonny always said he was mistaken ; of course she 'd told him , she recalled it clearly . But Morgan knew better . He suspected , even , that she 'd neglected to tell him on purpose : he tended to get annoyed by her slapdash attitude toward various birth-control methods . To his certain knowledge , the very first inkling he 'd had of that pregnancy was when Bonny arrived in the kitchen one morning wearing the baggy blue chambray shirt she habituallyused as a maternity smock . He was positive he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Amy will start down the stairs , " Bonny said . Evidently , they were planning the actual ceremony now . " Her father will meet her at the bottom and walk her to the center of the living room . " " Daddy , promise me you wo n't wear one of your hats , " Amy said . Morgan rocked in his chair and plucked on , thinking of the tall black father-of-the-bride top hat he would purchase for the occasion . He knew just where he could find one : Tuxedo Tom 's Discount Formal Wear . He began to feel slightly happier . But later , when Jim and Amy had gone out , he sank into a spell of sadness . He thought of what a sunny child Amy had been when she was small . She 'd had large , exaggerated curls swooping upward at each ear , so that she seemed to be wearing a Dutch cap . That Dutch-capped child , he thought , was whom he really mourned  --  not the present Amy , twenty-one years old , efficient secretary for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her safety . He 'd been a much more anxious parent than Bonny . " You know , " he told Bonny , " I used to be so certain that one of the children would die . Or all of them , even  --  I could picture that . I was so afraid they 'd be hit by cars , or kidnapped , or stricken withMORGAN 'S PASSINGpolio . I 'd warn them to look both ways , not to run with scissors , never to play with ropes or knives or sharp sticks . Relax , ' you 'd say . Remember ? But now look : it 's as if they died after all . Those funny little roly-poly toddlers , Amy in her OshKosh overalls  --  they 're dead , are n't they ? They did die . I was right all along . It 's just that it happened more slowly than I 'd foreseen . " " Now , dear , this is just an ordinary life development , " Bonny told him . He looked at her . She was seated at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding . On the wall above her was something like a hat rack  --  a row of short wooden arms . When you pressed a pearl pushbutton anywhere in this house , there was a clunk from the kitchen gong and one of the wooden arms would fly up , alerting a non-existent servant . Beneath each arm a yellowed label identified the room that had rung  --  or ( in the case of bedrooms ) the person . Mr. Armand . Mrs. Armand . Miss Caroline . Master Keith . Studying these labels , Morgan had the feeling that a younger , finer family lived alongside his , gliding through the hallways , calling for tea and hot-water bottles . Evenings , the mother sat by the fire in a white peignoir and read to her children , one on either side of her . A boy , a girl ; how tidy . At dinner they discussed great books , and on Sunday they dressed up and went to church . They never quarreled . They never lost things or forgot things . They rang and waited serenely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressions of theatregoers ignoring some petty disturbance in the row ahead . " I 'd like to invite Aunt Polly , " Bonny said , " but that means Uncle Darwin , too , and he 's so deaf and difficult . " She was peering through black-framed , no-nonsense glasses , which she 'd just started wearing for reading . Morgan said , " So did you die , when you think of it . " " Me ? " " Where 's that girl I used to take out walking ? I used toI O Ihold on to your arm , high up , and you would look off elsewhereand get pink , but you would n't pull away . " Bonny added a name to her list . She said , " Walking ? I do n't remember that . I thought we always drove . " He slid his fingers down the inside of her upper arm , where the skin was silkiest . The back of his hand brushed the weight of one breast . She did n't seem to notice . She said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She must be marrying him out of desperation . " Then she did look up . She said , " Could n't you still love the girls anyhow ? You do n't stop loving people just because they change size . " " Of course I love them . " " Not the same way , " she said . " It seems you get fixed on this one appearance of a person ; I mean , this single idea you have . " She clicked her ballpoint pen . " And anyway , why leap ahead so ? They have n't all grown up . Molly and Kate are still in high school . " " No , no , they 're gone , for all intents and purposes , " Morgansaid . " Out every evening , off somewhere , up to something . . . they 're gone , all right . " He brightened . " Aha ! " he said . " Alone at last , my dollink ! " But it called for too much effort . He drifted over to the stove , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " House feels so damn big , we need a ride-'em vacuum cleaner . " " You always did want more closet space , " Bonny told him . " They 've dumped their hamsters on us and gone away . " " Morgan . There were nine of us at dinner tonight , countingyour mother and Brindle . When I was a little girl , any time there were nine at table we had to send downtown for Mattie Ida to come help serve . " " What we ought to do is move , " Morgan said . " We could get a house in the country , maybe , live off the land . " He pictured himself in sabots and a rough blue peasant smock . The house would be a one-room cabin with a huge stone fireplace , a braided rug , and a daybed covered in some hand-wovenMORGAN 'S PASSINGfabric . Unbidden , Amy in her Dutch-cap curls bounced in the center of the daybed . He winced . " I 'll take an early retirement , " he said . " Forty-five feels older than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll have some time to ourselves . ' Wo n't that be nice ? " " Now , do n't go off on one of your crazy schemes , " Bonny told him . " You 'd die of boredom , retiring . You 'd feel useless . " " Useless ? " Morgan said . He frowned . But Bonny was on the track of something new , thoughtfullytapping her pen against her teeth . She said , " Morgan , in this day and age , do you believe the bride 's mother would still give the bride a little talk ? " " Hmm ? " " What I want to know is , am I expected to give Amy a talk about sex or am I not ? " " Bonny , do you have to call it sex ? " " What else would I call it ? " " Well ... " " I mean , sex is what it is , is n't it ? " " Yes , but , I do n't know . . . " " I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it ? " " Bonny , will you just stop hammering at me ? " " Anyhow , " she said , returning to her list , " in this day and age , I bet she 'd laugh in my face . " Morgan rubbed his forehead with two fingers . Really , it occurred to him , if Bonny had been more serious , more responsible , none of this upheaval would be happening . Or at least it would n't be happening quite so soon . It seemed to him that she had let the children slip through her fingers in some sort of sloppy , casual , cheerful style that was uniquely hers . He recalled that once , while chaperoning Kate 's sixth-grade class on a field trip to Washington , she 'd lost all eight of her charges in the Smithsonian Institution . They 'd been found among showcases full of savages , copying down the recipe for shrunken heads . At the school 's annual mother-daughter picnic , where everyone else brought potato salad and lemonade , Bonny brought a sack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had such a disastrous effect upon machinery ; she had only to settle behind the steering wheel and instantly the car fell apart . ' Warning lights would blink , steam would issue from the radiator , the muffler would drop off , and hubcaps would roll in every direction and clang along the gutters and slither down storm drains . She 'd make one simple right turn and the turn signal would never work again . No wonder he spent half his weekends on his back in the garage ! And she 'd passed all this on to the girls too . The first driving lesson he gave Amy , the left front window had slid down inside the door and could not be retrieved . For that he 'd had to go to the dealer . And then there was his sister , who had n't been out of that bathrobe of hers since Christmas . It hung on her like old orchid petals , wilted , striated , heavy-smelling . And his mother'smemory was failing more than ever now , though she flew into a fury if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharpness , she 'd recite whole portions of " Hiawatha " or the Rubaiyat . " Come , fill the Cup . . . ! " she 'd start up out of nowhere , slamming a fork against her glass , and Brindle would say , " Oh , Jesus , not again , " and all the others would groan and fall into their separate , disorderly factions around the table . Useless ? Living this life of his was such hard work that even if he retired tomorrow , he had no hope of feeling useless. 2 Amy stood at the top of the stairs , wearing white and carrying roses . The hall window behind her lit her long , filmy skirt . At the bottom of the stairs Morgan waited with his hand on the newel post . He wore his new top hat and a pure-black suit from Second Chance . ( There 'd been a little fuss about the hat , but he 'd held his ground . ) He had trimmed his beard . Gold-rimmed spectacles ( window glass ) perched on his nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's failings was that formal , official **26;7864;TOOLONG  --  weddings , funerals  --  never truly affected him . They just did n't seem to penetrate . He 'd lain awake half of last night mourning his daughter , but the fact was that now , with the ceremony about to begin , all that was on his mind was Amy 's roses . He had distinctly heard the wedding-dress lady tell her to carry them low , at arm 's length  --  too low , even , she said , because if Amy were nervous at all she 'd tend to lift them higher . And now , before the music had even started , Amy had her bouquet at breast level . This did n't trouble Morgan ( he could n't see that it made the slightest difference ) , but he wondered why nervousness should cause people to raise their arms . Was it something to do with protecting the heart ? Morgan experimented . He clasped his hands first low , then high . He did n't find the one any more comforting than the other . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dipping rhythmic processional , humming to himself as he sashayed across the hall . " Daddy , " Amy hissed . Morgan dropped his hands and hurried back to the newel post . Kate set the needle on the record . The wedding march began in mid-note . In the living room the guests grew suddenly still ; all Morgan heard was the creaking of their rented chairs . He smiled steadily up at Amy , his spectacles catching the light and flashing two white circles across her face . With her hand trailing down the banister , weightless as a leaf , Amy set a pointed satin slipper in the center of each step . Her skirt caused a clinking sound among the brass rods that anchored the Persian carpet . Yesterday morning Bonny had taken a red Magic Marker and colored in the bare spots in the carpet . Then she 'd used a brown Magic Marker for the rips in the leather armchair . ( Sometimes Morgan felt he was living in one of those crayoned paper houses that the twins used to make . ) Amy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembling slightly . He guided her into the living room and down the makeshift aisle . On this same stringy rug he had walked her for hours when she was just newborn . He had nestled her head on hisI O 5shoulder and paced the length of the rug and back , growlinglullabies . The memory did n't stir him . It was just there , just another , lower layer in this room that was full of layers . he led her up to Bonny 's minister , a man he disliked . ( I Ie disliked all ministers . ) Amy dropped his arm and took a place next to what's-his-name , Jim . Morgan stepped back and stood with his feet planted apart , his hands joined behind him . l Ie rocked a little to the lullaby in his head . " Who gives this woman to be married ? " the minister said . From the way the question rang in the silence , Morgan suspectedit might have been asked once before without his noticing . He seemed to have missed part of the service . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would have been more accurate to say , " Her mother does . " He turned and found his seat next to Bonny , who was looking beautiful and calm in a blue dress with a wide scoop neckline that kept slipping off one or the other of her shoulders . She laid a hand on top of his . Morgan noticed a gray thread of cobweb dangling from the ceiling . Jim put a ring on Amy 's finger . Amy put a ring on Jim 's finger . They kissed . Morgan thought of a plan : he would go live with them in their new apartment . They did n't know a thing , not a thing . No doubt they 'd have broken all their kitchen machines within a week and their household accounts would he a shambles , and then along would come Morgan to repair and advise . He would go as an old man , one of those really bereft old men with no teeth , no job , no wife , no family . In some small area he would act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care for him . He would arrive , perhaps , without buttons on his shirt , and would ask her to sew them on for him . He had no idea how to do it himself , he would tell her . Actually , Morgan was very good at sewing on buttons . Actually , he not only sewed on his own buttons but also Bonny 's and the girls ' , and patched their jeans and altered their hemlines , since Bonny was n't much of a seamstress . Actually , Amy was aware of this . She was also aware that he wasMORGAN 'S PASSINGnot a toothless old man and that he did have a wife and family . The trouble with fathering children was , they got to know you so well . You could n't make the faintest little realignment of the facts around them . They kept staring levelly into your eyes , eternally watchful and critical , forever prepared to pass judgment . They could point to so many places where you had gone permanently , irretrievably wrong. 3 There 'd been a compromise on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then Morgan had picked up some cheese and some crackers which the girls had put together this morning . He 'd been upset to discover that there was apparently no discount outlet for gourmet cheeses . " Do you know what these things cost ? " he asked the groom 's father , who had a hand poised over a cracker spread with something blue-veined . Then he wandered across the yard to check on the Camembert . It was surrounded by three young children  --  possibly Jim 's nephews . " This one smells like a stable , " the smallest was saying . " It smells like a gerbil cage . " " It smells like the . . . elephant house at the zoo ! " The weather had turned out fine , after all . It was a warm , yellow-green day , and daffodils were blooming near the garage . A smiling brown maid , on loan from Uncle 011ie , bore a tray of drinks through the crowd , picking her way carefully around the muddy patches where the spring reseedinghad not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an elderly gentleman whom Morganhad never seen before . His other daughters  --  oddly plain in their dress-up clothes  --  passed around sandwiches and little things on toothpicks , and his mother was telling the groom 's mother why she lived on the third floor . " I started out on the second floor , " she said , " but moved on account of the goat . " " I see , " said Mrs. Murphy , patting her pearls . Ion " This goat was housebroken , naturally , but the drawback was that I am the only person in this family who reads Time magazine . In fact , I have a subscription . And as coincidence would have it , the goat had only been trained on Time magazine . I mean , he would only . . . I mean , if the necessity arose , the only place he was willing to . . . was on a Time magazine spread on the floor . He recognized that red border , I suppose . And so you see if I were to lay my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this animal would come and just . . . would up and ... would ... " " He 'd pee all over it , " Morgan said . " Tough luck if she was n't through reading it . " " Oh , yes , " Mrs. Murphy said . She took a sip from her glass . At Morgan 's elbow , in a splintered wicker chair , an unknownman sat facing in the other direction . Maybe he was from the groom 's side . He had a bald spot at the back of his head ; fragile wisps of hair were drawn across it . He raised a drink to his lips . Morgan saw his weighty signet ring . " Billy ? " Morgan said . He went around to the front of the chair . Good God , it was Billy , Bonny 's brother . " Nice wedding , Morgan , " Billy said . " I 've been to a lot , you know  --  mostly my own . I 'm an expert on weddings . " He laughed . His voice was matter-of-fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter-of-factness sometimes encounteredin dreams . How could this be Billy ? What had happened here ? Morgan had last seen Billy not a month ago . He said , " Billy , from the back of your head I did n't know you . " " Really ? " Billy said , unperturbed . " Well , how about from the front ? " From the front he was the same as ever  --  boyish-looking , with a high , round forehead and dazzling blue eyes . But no , if you met him on the street somewhere , would n't he be just another half-bald businessman ? Only someone who 'd known him as long as Morgan had could find the bones in his slackeningface . Morgan stood blinking at him . Billy seemed first middle-aged and anonymous ; then he was Bonny 's **25;7892;TOOLONG baby brother ; then he was middle-aged again  --  like one of those trick pictures that alter back and forth as you shift your position . " Well ? " Billy said . " Have some champagne , why do n't you ? " Morgan asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scotch . " " Have some cheese , then . It 's very expensive . " " Good old Morgan , " Billy said , toasting him . " Good old , cheap old Morgan , right ? " Morgan wandered away again . He looked for someone else to talk to , but none of the guests seemed his type . They were all so genteel and well modulated , sipping their champagne , the ladies placing their high heels carefully to avoid sinking through the sod . In fact , who here was a friend of 1Mlorgan 's ? He stopped and looked around him . Nobody was . They were Bonny 's friends , or Amy 's , or the groom 's . A twin flew by  --  Susan , in chiffon . Her flushed , earnest face and steamy spectacles reminded him that his daughters , at least , bore some connection to him . " Sue ! " he cried . But she flung back , " I 'm not Sue , I 'm Carol . " Of course she was . He had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking his head . Under the dogwood tree , three uncles in gray suits were holding what appeared to be a committee meeting . " No , I 've been letting my cellar go , these days , " one of them was saying . " Been drinking what I have on hand . To put it bluntly , I 'm seventy-four years old . This June I 'll be seventy-five . A while back I was pricing a case of wine and they recommended that I age it eight years . Good enough , ' I started to say . Then I thought , Well , no . ' It was the strangest feeling . It was the oddest moment . I said , No , I suppose it 's not for me . Thanks anyway . ' " At a gap in the hedge , Morgan slipped through . He found himself on the sidewalk , next to the brisk , noisy street , on a normal Saturday afternoon . His car was parked alongside the curb . He opened the door and climbed in . For a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knees of his trousers . But the sun through the glass was baking him , andI 0 9finally he rolled down a window , dug through his pockets for the keys , and started the engine . These were his closest friends : Potter the musical-instrumentman , the hot-dog lady , the Greek tavern-keeper on Broadway , and Kazari the rug merchant . None of them would do . For one reason or another , there was n't a single person he could tell , " My oldest daughter 's getting married . Could I sit here with you and smoke a cigarette ? " He floated farther and farther downtown , as if descendingthrough darkening levels of water . All 's Fair Pawnshop , Billiards , Waterbeds , Beer , First House of Jesus , souL BROTHER DO NOT BURN . Flowers were blooming in unlikely places  --  around a city trashcan and in the tiny , parched weedpatchbeneath a rowhouse window . He turned a corner where a man sat on the curb flicking out the blade of his knife , slamming it shut with the heel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveled on . He passed Meller Street , then Merger Street . He turned down Crosswell . He parked and switched the engine off and sat looking at Crafts Unlimited . It was months since he 'd been here . The shopwindow was filled with Easter items now  --  hand-decorated eggs and stuffed rabbits , a patchwork quilt like an early spring garden . The Merediths ' windows were empty , as always ; you could n't tell a thing from them . Maybe they 'd moved . ( They could move in a taxi , with one suitcase , after ten minutes ' preparation . ) He slid out of the car and walked toward the shop . He climbed the steps , pushed through the glass door , and gazed  --  p the narrow staircase . But he did n't have what it took to continue . ( What would he say ? How would he explain himself ? ) Instead , he turned left , through a second glass door and into the crafts shop . It smelled of raw wood . A grayhaired , square-boned woman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hello , " she said , and then she glanced up and gave him a startled look . It was the top hat , he supposed . He wished he 'd worn something more appropriate . And why were there no other customers ? He was all alone , conspicuous , in a roomful of quilted silence . MORGAN 'S PASSINGThen he saw the puppets . " Ah , so ! " he said . " Ze poppets ! " Surprisingly , he seemed to have developed an accent  --  from what country , he could n't say . " Zese poppets are for buying ? " he asked . " Why , yes , " the woman said . They lay on a center table : Pinocchio , a princess , a dwarf , an old lady , all far more intricate than the first ones he 'd seen . Their heads were no longer round , simple , rubber-ball heads but were constructed of some padded cloth , with tiny stitches making wrinkles and bulges . The old-lady puppet , in particular , had a face so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Wonderful ! " he said , still in his accent . " They 're sewn by a girl named Emily Meredith , " the woman told him . " A remarkable craftsman , really . " Morgan nodded . He felt a mixture of jealousy and happiness . " Yes , yes , " he wanted to say , " do n't I know her very well ? Do n't I know both of them ? Who are you , to speak of them ? " But also he wanted to hear how this woman saw them , what the rest of the world had to say about them . He waited , still holding the puppet . The woman turned back to her animals . " Perhaps I see her workroom , " he said . " Pardon ? " " She leeve nearby , yes ? " " Why , yes , she lives just upstairs , but I 'm not sure she  --  " " Zis means a great deal to me , " Morgan said . Across from him , on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with weaving . Its doors were wavery glass , and they reflected a shortened and distorted view of Morgan  --  a squat , bearded man in a top hat . ToulouseLautrec . Of course ! He adjusted the hat , smiling . Everything black turned transparent , in the glass . He wore a column of rainbow-colored weaving on his head and a spade of weaving on his chin . " You see , I also am artiste , " he told the woman . Definitely , his accent was a French one . She said , " Oh ? " " I am solitary man . I know no other artistes . " I I I " But I do n't think you understand , " she said . " Emily and her husband , they just give puppet shows to children , mainly . ' l hey only sell puppets when they have a few extras . They 're not exactly  --  " " Steel , " he said , " I like to meet zem . I like you to introduce mc . You know so many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What your name is , please ? " " Well . . . Mrs. Apple , " she said . She thought a moment . " Oh , all right . I do n't suppose they would mind . " She called to someone at the rear , " Hannah , will you watch for customers ? " Then she turned to lead Morgan out the side door . He followed her up the staircase . There was a smell of fried onions and disinfectant . Mrs. Apple 's hips looked very broad from this angle . She became , by extension , someone fascinating : she must speak to the Merediths every day , know intimately their schedules and their habits , water their plants when they went on tour . He restrained the urge to set a friendly palm on her backside . She glanced at him over her shoulder , and he gave her a reassuring smile . At the top of the stairs she turned to the right and knocked on a tall oak door . " Emily ? " she called . But when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Ic was holding a newspaper . When he saw Morgan , he drew the paper sharply to his chest . " Dr. Morgan ! " he said . Mrs. Apple said , " Doctor ? " She looked at Morgan and then at Leon . " Why , " she said , " is this the doctor you told me about ? The one who delivered Gina ? " Leon nodded . " But I thought you were an artist ! " Mrs. Apple said . " You said you were an artist ! " Morgan hung his head . He shuffled his feet . " I was embarrassed about my hat , " he said . " I 've just recently come from a wedding ; I know I look ridiculous . I said I was an artist so you would n't laugh at me . " " Oh , you poor man , " Mrs. Apple said . Then she did laugh . " You and your zis and zat . ' Your zese and zose . ' " MORGAN 'S PASSINGHe risked a glance at Leon . Leon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he kept the newspaper clamped to his chest as if guarding secrets . " I do want to see your workroom , " Morgan told him . " I may buy a large number of puppets . " " We do n't have a large number , " Leon said . " Oh , come on , Leon , " Mrs. Apple said . " Why not show him ? What 's the harm ? " She nudged Morgan in the side . " You and your artistes . ' Your poppets . ' " She started laughingagain . Her eyes grew rays of wrinkles at the corners . Leon stood scowling at Mrs. Apple . Then , " Well , " he said ungraciously , and he stepped back and turned to lead them down the hall . Morgan peered swiftly into the room on his right  --  a flash of sunken sofa and a half-empty bookcase . On his left was the kitchen ; he had an impression of cold , gleaming whiteness . The next door on the left led to the workroom . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window , and a stubby aluminum stepladder on which Emily sat snipping paper . Her black skirt drooped around her , nearly obscuring the ladder . The braids on top of her head picked up light from somewhere and glinted like flying sparks . " Emily , " Leon said . She looked up . Then she jumped off the stepladder and hid whatever she was doing behind her back . " What do you want ? " she asked Morgan . " Why , Emily . Goodness , " Mrs. Apple said . " This is Dr. Morgan . Do n't you recognize him ? He 's come to buy some puppets . A large number of puppets , Emily . " " Buy them downstairs , " said Emily , white-faced . You would think she had something against him . Morgan tried not to feel hurt . He smiled at her . He said , " I like to see the process of things . Actually . " " There 's no process going on here . " He stroked his beard . Mrs. Apple said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow puppets . " She told Morgan , " She 's trying something new , I I 3Doctor : shadow puppets , out of paper . See ? " She crossed to the sewing machine and took something from one of its drawers . It was the silhouette of a knight in armor , attached to a slender rod . " You notice he 's hinged at the joints , " she said . " You work him behind a screen . He casts a shadow on the screen . Is n't that clever ? " " Yes , certainly , " said Morgan . He looked around the room . He wondered what Emily sat on while she worked at the sewing machine . The stepladder , maybe ? Even in his fondestfantasies he had not imagined such starkness . He was fascinated . " And will you be using shadow puppets in your shows now ? " he asked Emily . " Yes , " she said shortly . " No , " Leon said . There was a pause . Mrs. Apple gave a little laugh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all how they 're hinged , nothing more . How Emily caused their joints to swing when she made them . " " So ? " Emily said . " You just scoot them along the ledge behind the screen , and their joints fall into place . There 's nothing to do , even less to do than there is with the old kind of puppets . " " So ? " They stared at each other . Morgan cleared his throat . " Is that your child I 'm hearing ? " he asked . Of course it was . She was singing something in a small , cracked voice , off in some other room . But nobody answeredhim . Ile poked his head out into the hall . Then he crossed the hall and went into the bedroom . There was a mattress in one corner and a bureau in another , and a narrow cot along one wall . A child sat on the cot , fitting Tinker Toys together . She sang , " . . . how to get to Sesame Street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan said , " Hello there . " She looked at him doubtfully . He heard the Merediths coming , and he said quickly , MORGAN 'S PASSING " Would you like my hat ? " He tore his hat from his head and set it on hers , tilting it back so it would n't engulf her completely . From the doorway , Emily said , " Gina ! Take that off . You never try another person 's hat on . " " It 's my hat , " Gina said . " He gave it to me . " " Take it off , " Leon said . " No . " She had a round face and a pointed chin ; she had to keep her chin raised so the hat would n't slide down over her eyes . This made her look proud and challenging . In fact , she resembled Leon , Morgan thought . When Emily tried to lift the hat from her head , Gina fought her hands away . " It 's my hat . It 's mine . " Morgan said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emily stopped struggling , but she continued to stand betweenMorgan and the child , shielding her . Her eyes were pale and cold . She had her arms folded tightly , and Leon stood firm beside her . Mrs. Apple said , " Dr. Morgan ? " She arrived breathless , and handed him another shadow puppet . This one was a king . He might have stepped out of a stained-glass window ; red and blue transparent paper covered the pierced design in his robe . Lit behind a screen , he would cast jewel-like colored shadows . " Is n't he marvelous ? " Mrs. Apple said . " It 's art ! You could hang it on the wall . " " That 's true , I could , " Morgan said . He stroked the coloredpaper with a thumb . Something about the precision of the design made him feel sad and deprived . His gaze slid off the king and away , landing finally on the bureau . Its top was nearly bare . There were no bottles or safety pins or ticket stubs ; just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of this building . Gina rode on Leon 's shoulders . Her plump little calves bracketed his neck . All three of them were smiling squintily into the sunlight . Morgan stepped closer and bent over the photo , pinching his lower lip between his thumb and index finger . The king hung for-I I 5gotten in his left hand . Bemused , he peered into a drawer that was partway open . Then he opened it further and studied its contents : three white shirts and a box of Kleenex . " Dr. Morgan ! " Emily said sharply . " Yes , yes . " He followed the others out of the room , laying a hand on Gina 's head as he passed . Her hair was so soft , it seemed to cling to his fingers for several seconds afterward . Back in the workroom , he said , " What do you do with Gina while you 're giving your puppet shows ? " Emily turned away , refusing to answer , but Leon said , " We take her along . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , no . She 's just barely turned four . " " She knows the ropes , though , " Morgan suggested . " She was raised backstage , after all . She knows to stay quiet while a play is going on . " " Gina ? " Leon said . He laughed . " Gina 's never been quiet a full minute in her life . We have to keep hushing her all through the show , and if it 's a birthday party , it 's worse . She cries when someone else gets to blow out the candles . She hates it when Emily pays attention to other children . " " Oh , you ought to see one of their shows , " said Mrs. Apple . She slid the king out of Morgan 's hand . Without noticing , he 'd rucked up one corner of the colored paper . " They 're getting so well known ! They 've been all the way to Washington . And a man who runs an entertainment companywanted to just take them over , make them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever tell that man , Leon ? Did you ever answer his letter ? " " I threw it away , " Leon said . " Threw it away ! " " It was some kind of Bible group . Gospel singers and things . " " But  --  threw it away ! You could at least have answered it . " " And off in some poky town , " Leon said . " Tinville , Tindale ... " MORGAN 'S PASSING " I doubt you ever answer letters , " Morgan said . He felt suddenly pleased and excited . Leon said , " Oh , well ... " " Really , what 's the point ? Why complicate your lives ? You go downstairs to clear out the mailbox every now and then , and you glance at what 's there and toss it all in the wastebasket and come back empty-handed . " " Well , sometimes , " Leon said . " When ? " Emily asked him . Then she turned to Morgan and said , " We 're not who you believe we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not who you imagine . " " Come look at Rip Van Winkle , " Mrs. Apple said . " We live like anyone else . We manage fine . We like to beleft alone , " said Emily . " Let me show you to the door . " " Oh , but Emily ! " Mrs. Apple said . " He has n't seen all thepuppets ! " " He 's seen enough . " " He wanted to buy a large number ! " " No , no , that 's all right . . . I really must be going , " Morgansaid . " Thank you anyhow . " Emily spun through the door , a swirl of black skirt , and he followed her . They went down the hallway single-file  --  Emily , Morgan , Leon . Mrs. Apple stayed behind , no doubt looking around at the puppets in bewilderment . " Maybe some other time ? " she called after him . " Yes , maybe so ... " He skidded on a Tinker Toy and said , " Oh , excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clapped a hand to his head . " I 'd better go home and change , " he said . " Change ? " Leon asked . " Yes , I . . . need another hat . " His voice was echoing now ; they 'd reached the stairs . But instead of starting down , he looked at the door across the landing . " Who lives there ? " he asked . " Joe and Hannah Miles , " said Leon , but Emily said , " No one . " I17 " Miles ? Are they craftsmen also ? " " We 'll see you to the street , " Emily told him . She pushed forward , edging him toward the stairs , and when he took his first step down , she followed so closely that he felt hounded . " I do n't understand you , " she said . ( He should have known . She would not veil anything ; she was as uncurtained as her windows . ) " What do you want of us ? What are you after ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in doorways and peer around corners ? " " Oh ? You noticed ? " Morgan said . He staggered with embarrassment and grabbed the banister . " You could have come straight up and said hello , like ordinary people . " " Yes , but I was so . . . I 'd built up this idea of you . I almost preferred watching , do n't you see . My own household is impossible . Very confusing , very tedious , " he said . He stopped , halfway down the last flight of stairs . " Oh , you think it 's all so romantic , I suppose , " he said . " Big-city doctor ! Saving lives . But mostly it 's a treadmill . I work too far downtown ; I attract a low class of patient . Twice I 've had my office robbed by addicts looking for drugs , and one of those times I was present . They tied my secretary to her chair with a raincoat belt and they made me go through all my desk drawers . It was unnerving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decongestants , sinus tablets , pediatric nosedrops .. . I 'm not a brave man . I gave them all I had . I tell you this to show you what sort of existence I lead , Emily , Leon ... " He was out of breath . He felt a white space inside his head , as if he were standing at an unaccustomed altitude . " Just hear what happened last summer , " he said . " I had this patient who 'd been stabbed . Stabbed in front of a Fells Point bar , something to do with a woman . They brought him in and woke me in the dead of night . That 's the kind of practice I have  --  such fine patients . And no answering service , no condominium in Ocean City where I can vanish over the weekend . . . Anyhow . He had a long , shallow cut all down the left side , from the ribcage to the hipbone , fortunately clearMORGAN 'S PASSINGof the heart . I laid him on the table in my office and stitched him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a quarter  --  a tiresome job , as you might imagine . Then just as I 'm knotting the last stitch , wham ! The door bursts open . In comes the man who stabbed him . Pulls out a knife and rips him down the right side , ribcage to hipbone . Back to the needle and thread . Another hour and a quarter . " Leon gave a sudden snort of laughter , but Emily just nudged Morgan forward . Morgan resumed his descent , leaningheavily on the banister like someone old and rheumatic . He said , " They come to me with headaches , colds , black eyes ... self-healing things . A man who does sedentary work  --  a taxi driver , say  --  will spend the weekend moving furniture and then call me out of bed on a Sunday night . Doc , I got the most terrible backache . Do you think it could be a disk ? A fusion ? Will I need an operation ? ' For this I went to medical school ! " " Here , " said Emily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open for him and held out her hand . " Goodbye , " she told him . Leon grinned anxiously behind her , as if trying to ease the insult . Morgan took her hand and was startled by its lightness and its dryness . " You do n't want to be friends at all , do you ? " he said . " No , " Emily told him . " Ah , " he said . " And why would that be ? " " I do n't like how you try to get into our lives . I hate it ! I do n't like being pried into . " " Emily , " Leon said . " No , no , " Morgan told him . " It 's quite all right . I understand . " He looked away , toward his dusty , sagging car . He had no feelings whatsoever . It seemed he 'd been emptied . " Maybe you could meet my wife , " he said with an effort . " Would you like to meet Bonny ? Have I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have very nice children , very normal , very ordinary ; they seem determined to be ordinary . . . Two are in high school . One 's grown , really , a secretary ; and four others are in college , here and there . MostI19of the year , they 're gone . We hardly hear from them . But that 's the way it is , right ? Every parent says that . You can see that I 'm a family man . Does that help ? No , I guess it does n't . " It seemed he was still holding Emily 's hand . He dropped it . " The oldest girl 's getting married , " he said . " I 'm not a doctor . I work in a hardware store . " Emily said , " What ? " " I manage Cullen Hardware . " " But . . . you delivered our baby ! " she said . " Ah , well , " he told her , " I have n't witnessed three of my daughters ' births for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarettes , but when he found a pack , he just stood holding it and looking into their stunned faces . " That stablingbusiness , well , I read it in the paper , " he said . " I presented myself untruthfully . I do that often , in fact . I often find myselfgiving a false impression . It 's not something I intend , you understand . It almost seems that other people conspire with me , push me into it . That day you called for a doctor in the house : no one else came forward . There was this long , long silence . And it seemed like such a simple thing  --  offer some reassurance , drive you to the hospital . I had no inkling I 'd actually have to deliver a baby . Events just . . . rolled me forward , so to speak . " He wished they would say something . All they did was stare at him . Meanwhile a girl in an old-fashioned dress climbed the front steps and said , " Hello , Emily , Leon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or move aside when she slipped past them and through the open door . " Please . It 's not entirely my fault , " he said . " Why are people so willing to believe me ? Just tell me that . And this is what 's depressing : they 'll believe me all the quicker if I tell them something disillusioning . I might say , for instance , that being a movie star is not what it 's cracked up to be . I 'll say the lights are so hot that my make-up runs , and there 's forever this pinkish-gray stain around the inside of my collar that my wife despairs of . Clorox has no effect on it ; not even Wisk does , though she 's partially solved the problem by **25;7919;TOOLONG . What she does , you see , is rub my collar with a bar of white bath soap before I put a shirt on . Yes , that seems to work out fairly well , I 'll say . " " This is crazy , " Leon told him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be crazy ! " But Emily said , " Well , I do n't know . I see what he means , in a way . " Both men turned to stare at her . Leon said , " You do ? " " He just . . . has to get out of his life , sometimes , " she said . Then Morgan gave a long , shaky sigh and sank down onthe stoop . " My oldest daughter 's getting married , " he said . " Could I sit here with you and smoke a cigarette ? " 19731 The newspaper said , Crafts Revival in Baltimore ? FestivalBegins June 2 . There was a picture of Henry Prescott , ankle-deep in wood chips , carving one of his decoys. ' here was a picture of Leon Meredith holding up a puppet , with his wife beside him and his daughter at his feet . He was a grim , handsome , angular man , and his mouth was sharply creviced at the corners . He was not a young boy any more . It took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper on the kitchen table , pushing away several breakfast dishes , and leaned over it on both elbows to study it more closely . I'he porous texture of the newsprint gave Leon a dramatic look  --  all hollows and steep planes . Next to him , EmilyMORGAN 'S PASSINGseemed almost featureless . Even Gina failed to show how specialshe was . " The whole idea , " Leon was quoted as saying , " is improvisation . We take it moment by moment . We adapt as we go along . I 'm talking about the plays , you understand  --  not the puppets . The puppets are my wife 's doing . She makes then according to a fixed pattern . They 're not improvised . " This was true , in a way , and yet it was n't . Emily did have a homemade brown-paper pattern for the puppets ' outlines , but the outlines were the least of it . What was important was the faces , the dips and hills of their expressions , which tended to develop unexpected twists of their own no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , definitely , the puppets were improvised too . She wished she 'd spoken up when that reporter was interviewing them  --  said something to defend herself . " The heads are padded , " Leon said , " and stiffened with some kind of sizing . My wife mixes the sizing . She has her own recipe , her own way of doing things . I 'm allowed to help with the props sometimes , but my wife insists on making the puppets totally by herself . " Emily folded the paper and laid it aside . She went down the hall to the back room . It was Gina 's room now . The sewingmachine and the muslin bags had been moved to the room Leon and Emily shared ; Gina 's belongings had multipliedtoo far to be contained in one small corner . Her unmadebed was laden with stuffed animals , books , and clothes . In the rocking chair by the window sat a Snoopy dog bigger than Gina . Grandma and Grandpa Meredith had brought it for her sixth birthday . Emily felt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to mention the cost . What could they have been thinking of ? " Oh , well , " Leon had told her , " that 's just how they are , I guess . You know how they are . " Gina was under the bed . She emerged , frowsy-haired , with a sneaker in her hand . " Are n't you ready yet ? " Emily asked her . " It 's time to go . " I2 3 " I was looking for my shoe . " Emily took the sneaker from her and loosened a knot in the lace . " Now , Gina , listen , " she said . " We 've got a play to give out in the county today , and we 're leaving before you get back . When kindergarten 's over , you walk home with the Berger girls and wait in the shop till we come . Mrs. Apple says she 'll keep an eye on you . " " Why ca n't I stay home and go with you ? " " Summer will be here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be home all the time , come summer . " She slipped the sneaker on Gina 's foot and tied it . Gina 's socks were already creased and soiled and falling down her ankles . Her blouse had egg on the front . Emily had known children like Gina when she was a child herself . They had a kind of extravagant squalor ; there was something lush about the tumbled appearance of their clothing . She had always assumed their mothers were to blame , but now she knew better . Not half an hour ago Gina had been neat as a pin ; Emily had made certain of it . She plucked a dust ball from Gina 's hair , which was rich and thick-stranded like Leon 's . " Come along , " she told her . " You 'll be late . " She slung her purse on her shoulder and they left the apartnient , clicking the latch very gently because Leon was still asleep . They walked down the stairs , where everyone 's breakfastsmells hung in the air  --  bacon , burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door of the shop , which was still dark , and stepped out into the street . It was a warm , sunny morning . The city looked freshly washed , with gold-lit buildings rising through a haze in the distance , women in spring dresses sweeping their stoops , green ivy flooding through the windows of an abandoned rowhouse. ( ; ina hung on to Emily 's hand and skipped and sang : Miss Lucy had a baby , She called it Tiny Tim , She put it in the bathtub To see if it could swim .. MORGAN 'S PASSINGEmily said good morning to Mrs. Ellery , who was shaking out her dust mop , and to the ancient blind man whose daughter , or granddaughter it must have been , set him on his stoop every fair day with a grayish quilt wrapped around his legs . " Nice weather , " Emily called , and the old man nodded , turning his sealed-looking eyelids toward the sun like a plant in the window . She stopped on the second corner to wait for the Berger girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little freckled redheads in plaid dresses . They ran ahead with Gina , and at the next intersection Emily had to call , " Stop ! Wait ! " She hurried up , out of breath , while they lurched and teetered on the edge of the curb . She held out her hands , and the younger Berger girl took one and Gina took the other . The Berger child was all bones ; Emily felt a rush of love for Gina 's warm , chubby fingers , which were slightly sticky in the creases . She waded across the street , embroiled in children , and turned them loose on the other side . They scattered ahead again , skipping disjointedly . Miss Lucy called the doctor , Miss Lucy called the nurse , Miss Lucy called the lady With the alligator purse .. . Emily sensed a presence nearby , the shape of someone familiar , and she turned and found Morgan Gower loping along beside her . He tipped his battered green Army helmet and smiled . " Morgan , " she said . " How come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sleep past five o'clock this morning , " he said . " There 's too much excitement at the house . " At Morgan 's house there was always too much excitement . She 'd never been there , but she pictured a bulging , seething box of a place  --  the roof straining off , the side seams splitting . " What is it this time ? " she asked him . " It 's Brindle . My sister . Her sweetheart came back . " Emily had n't known his sister had a sweetheart . She shadedI 2 5her eyes and called , " Children ! Wait for me ! " Then she said , " Did Kate get out of her leg cast yet ? " " Who ? " he asked . " Oh , yes . Yes , that 's all . . . but see , at seven or so last night , just at the end of supper , the doorbell rang and Bonny said , Brindle , go see who that is , will you ? ' since Brindle was nearest the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd reached the intersection . Emily held out her hands and the children swarmed around her , knocking Morgan backward a pace . When she 'd crossed to the other side and turned to look for him , he was picking up his helmet from the gutter . He polished it with his sleeve , sadly , and set it on his head . It matched his splotchy camouflage jacket and his crumpled olive-drab jungle pants . He was always dressing for catastrophes that were unlikely to occur , she thought . " These are guaranteed , certified , snake-proof boots , " he said now . He stopped to hold up one green foot . " I bought them at Sunny 's Surplus . " " They 're very nice , " she said . " Children ! Slow down , please . " " How come you have those other two girls ? " Morgan asked . " I do n't remember seeing them before . " " I 'm trading off with their mother . She 's walking Gina home today so that I can do a show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Morgan said . " I come to you people for peace and quiet and I find this disorganization . Look at Gina : she has n't even said hello to me . " " Oh , she will ; you know she loves to see you . It 's only that she 's with friends . " " I prefer it when you both come and Gina walks between you , just the one of her . Where 's Leon ? Why is n't he here ? " " He 's sleeping . He was out late last night , trying for a part in a play . " " It 's too disorganized , " Morgan said glumly . He stopped , Ind peered down the front of his jacket . Then he reached inside and brought up a pack of cigarettes . " So Brindle goesMORGAN 'S PASSINGto the door , " he said , " and nothing more happens . There 's nothing but silence . Well , we thought she might have faded off somewhere . Forgot where she was headed . Lost her way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know about her : always in that bathrobe , moping . How was your day ? ' you ask , and she says , Day ? ' She acts surprised to hear there 's been one . Go see where she 's got to , ' Bonny tells me . She 's your sister ; see what she 's up to . ' So I push away from the table and go to find her and there she is in the entrance hall being kissed by a total stranger . It 's one of those long , deep , wrap-around kisses , like in the movies . I was uncertain what to do about it . It seemed rude to interrupt , but if I turned and left they 'd no doubt hear the floorboards creak , so I just stood there flossing my teeth and the two of them went on kissing . Heavy-set man with slicked-down hair . Brindle in her bathrobe . Finally I ask , Was there something you wanted ? ' Then they pulled apart and Brindle said , It 's Robert Roberts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " " Children ! " Emily called . They 'd reached another intersection . She ran ahead to take their hands . Morgan followed , muttering something . " Known him all his life , of course " was what it sounded like . " Knew him when he was a bit of a thing , coming to play roll-a-bat with Brindle in the alley . Called her Idiot . Dumbhead . Moron , ' in that fond , insulting way that childhood sweethearts have ... " The school loom &; up , a gloomy building surrounded by cracked concrete , , teeming with shabby children . Emily bent to kiss Gina goodbye . " Have a good day , honey , " she said , and Morgan said , " How about old Morgan ? No kiss for Uncle Morgan ? " He bent over , and Gina threw her arms around his neck and kissed his cheek . " Come by after school and help me again with my yo-yo , " she said . " All right , sugar-pie . " " You promise ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she ran off , he stood watching after her , smiling andI27tapping cigarette ashes across the toes of his boots . " Ah , yes . Ah , yes , " he said . " What a darling , eh ? I wish she 'd stay this size forever . " " I hate that school , " Emily said . " Why ! What could be wrong with it ? " " It 's so crowded ; classes are so big , and I doubt I 'll ever feel safe letting her walk here alone . I 'd like to send her someplace private . Leon 's parents have offered to pay , but I do n't know . I 'd have to think how to bring it up with Leon . " " No , no , leave her here . Do n't forsake your principles , " Morgan said . He took her elbow and turned her toward home . " I never thought you 'd send your daughter to a private school . " " Why not ? What principles ? " Emily asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Bonny 's doing , " Morgan told her . " She has this money . We never see it , never buy anything inspiring with it , but it 's there , all right , for things that do n't show  --  new slate roof tiles and the children 's education . Her money is so well behaved ! I would have preferred a public school , myself . Why , surely . You do n't want to cart her off to some faraway place , all these complicated carpools  --  " " Dad Meredith happened to mention it while Leon was out of the room , " Emily said . " On purpose , I guess . He must be hoping I 'll wear Leon down , so when the subject comes up again Leon will be used to it . But I have n't said a word , becauseLeon 's so proud about money . And you know what a temper he has . " " Temper ? " Morgan said . " He might just explode . " " Oh , I ca n't picture that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I ca n't picture that at all , " Morgan said . He stopped and looked around him . " I would offer to take you for a drive , " he said , " just to celebrate the return of Robert Roberts , do n't you know . I 'm much too keyed up to work today . But , unfortunately , my car 's been stolen . " " Oh , that 's terrible , " Emily said . " When did it happen ? " " Just now , " he told her . " Now ? This morning ? " " This instant , " he said . He pointed to an empty place at the curb , beside a mailbox . " I parked it here , where I thought you might be passing . Now it 's disappeared . " Emily 's mouth dropped open . " There , there , I 'm not upset , " he said . " As you would say : what 's a car , after all ? " He spread his arms , smiling . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right ? I 'm better off without it . " Emily did n't know how he could talk that way . A car was very important . She and Leon had been saving for one for years . " You ought to call the police immediately , " she told him . " Come back with me and use our telephone . Time really matters . " " There 'd be no point , " he said . " I 've never had much faith in policemen . " He took her elbow again to lead her on . The grip of his tense , warm fingers reminded her of Gina . " Last summer , " he said , " while we were driving to the beach , a state trooper flagged us down and asked us for a lift . He said his patrol car had been stolen . Can you imagine ? He got in the rear with Molly and Kate and my mother . . . those big , shiny boots , gun in a holster . . . he leaned over the front seat and saw Bonny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch it with those seeds , ' he told her . He said , My cousin Donna used to love appleseeds . Best part of the apple , she claimed . One year me and my brother saved up all our seeds in a Baby Ben alarm-clock box and gave them to her for Christmas . She was thrilled . She ate them every one , and by evening she was dead . Here 's where I get off , ' he said ; so I stopped the car and out he climbed and that was the last we saw of him . It seemed he 'd only popped in to bring us this message , you know ? And then departed . I said to Bonny , I told her , Think of it , the lives of ordinary citizens in the hands of a man like that . Walking around with a gun , ' I said . ' No doubt loaded , no doubt cocked , or whatever it is you do with a gun . ' " " Yes , but . . . " Emily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next policeman would n't be so peculiar . But then she wondered . Some people , it appeared , attract the peculiar all their lives . " Well , anyway , " she said , " it would n't hurt just to give the police a phone call . " " Maybe not , maybe not , " Morgan said . He was reading a chipped and peeling sign : EUNOLA 'S RESTAURANT . " Is this place any good ? " he asked . " I 've never tried it . " " Lived right here in the neighborhood and never tried runola 's ? " " It 's a matter of money . " " Let 's go in and have some coffee , " Morgan said . " I thought you had to open your store . " " Oh , Butkins will do that . He 's happier without me , to tell the truth . I get in the way . " He pulled open the door and shepherded Emily in ahead of him . There were four small tables and a counter where a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a veil of cigarette smoke . " Sit , " Morgan said , guiding her to a table . He settled opposite her . " Do you know what this means , this Robert Roberts business ? I ) o you see the implications ? Why , it 's wonderful ! First the years go by and Brindle stays in her bathrobe , moping , scuffingabout in her slippers , wondering when the next meal is . ' Fix it yourself , if you 're hungry , ' I 've told her , but she says , ' Well , ' she says , ' I do n't know where anything 's kept , the food and utensils and such . ' Understand , this is a house she 's been living in since nineteen . . . was it sixty-four ? Or maybe sixty-five , she moved in . Kate was already in school , I remember . Sue had started her piccolo lessons . . . Then here comes Robert Roberts ! Here he comes , out of the blue . He says his wife is dead now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always with Brindle . I ca n't imagine why . She 's very plain toMORGAN 'S PASSINGlook at and she 's not at all good-natured . But his heart was always with her , he says . And he was the very person she 's been telling us about at the dinner table , every night of our lives . Why , our children knew Robert Roberts 's name before they knew their own ! They knew all his favorite board games and his batting average . And here he comes , with an armload of roses , the most colossal heap of roses ; the whole entrance hall took on that rainy , dressed-up smell that roses have . . . and asking her to marry him ! Is n't life . . . symmetrical ? I 'd really underestimated it . " A waitress stood over them , tapping her pencil . Emily cleared her throat and said , " I 'll have coffee , please . " " Me too , " said Morgan . " Yes , it was quite a night . The two of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept them company . They want to get married in June , they say . " " You certainly have a lot of weddings in your family , " Emily told him . " Oh , not really , " he said . He reached across the table for her purse , opened it , and peered inside . " There was Amy 's , of course , and then Jean 's , but I do n't count Carol 's ; she got divorced before she 'd finished writing her thank-you notes . " He turned the purse upside down and shook it . Emily 's wallet fell out , followed by a key ring . He shook the purse again , but it was empty . " Look at that ! " he said . " You 're so orderly . " Emily retrieved her belongings and put them back in her purse . Morgan watched , with his head cocked . " I too am orderly , " he told her . " You are ? " " Well , at least I have an interest in order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was a child , I thought order might come when my voice changed . Then I thought , no , maybe when I 'm educated . At one point I thought I would be orderly if I could just once sleep with a woman . " He took a napkin from the dispenser and unfolded it and smoothed it across his knees . Emily said , " Well ? " I 3 I " Well , what ? " " Did sleeping with a woman make you orderly ? " " How can you ask ? " he said . He sighed . Their coffee arrived , and he seized the sugarbowl and started spooning out sugar . Four teaspoons , five . . . he stirred after each spoonful , and dripped coffee on the tabletop and into the bowl . Caramel-colored beads grew up across the surface of the sugar . Emily looked at them and then at Morgan . Morgan bared his teeth at her encouragingly . She looked away again . Why put up with him ? He was really so strange that sometimes , out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paces ahead so that no one would guess they were acquainted . Or when the three of them were together , she 'd make a point of taking Leon 's arm . But it was funny how he grew on a person . He added something ; she could n't say just what . He made things look more interesting than they really were . Sometimes he accompanied the Merediths when they went to put on a puppet show , and from the squirrel-like attention he gave to all they did she would understand , suddenly , how very exotic this occupation was  --  itinerant puppeteers ! Well , not itinerant , exactly , but still . . . and she 'd look at Leon and realize what a flair he had , with his deep , dark eyes and swift movements . She herself would feel not quite so colorless ; she would notice that Gina , who sometimes struck her as a little blowzy , was just like one of those cherubic children on a nineteenth-century chocolate box . " Leon 's picture was in the paper , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned forward . She saw that this must be why she 'd agreed to stop for coffee . " There was an article , " she said , " in the morning paper , all about our puppets . " " Oh , I missed it , " he said . " I left the house too early . " " They had a picture of the three of us , but really it was Leon 's article , " she said . Morgan lit a cigarette and tipped his chair back , studying her . MORGAN 'S PASSING " He talked about the puppets , how they 're . . . oh , not improvised . How they 're cut from a pattern . " She folded her hands and examined her knuckles . " He meant something by that . It 's hard to explain . If I tell you what it meant , you 'll think I 'm imagining things . " " You probably are , " Morgan said . " And last night , this play he went to try for . . . what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd memorize a part for tryouts . He would n't just go and read it , like other people . He had this very quick memory . It always made an impression . So yesterday afternoon he started to learn the part he wanted , and it turned out he could n't do it . He 'd memorize one line and go on to the next , but when he put the two together he found he 'd forgotten the first one and he 'd have to begin all over again . It kept happening . It was eerie . I knew the lines , finally , just from hearing them ; but he still did n't . And he blamed me for it . He did n't say so outright , but he did . I know . " " You 're imagining things , " Morgan said . " It 's true that he 's changed since he met me , " Emily said . Morgan rocked on his chair legs , smoking and frowning . He said , " Did I ever tell you I was married once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think so . And now he 's so friendly with his parents . Well , of course he can say that 's all my doing ; I used to be the only one who spoke to them . But now it seems . . . well , truthfully , they visit a little too much . He gets on with them a little too well . " " I married during my senior year in college , " Morgan said . " Her name was Letitia . We eloped and never told a soul . But as soon as we got married , we lost interest in each other . It was the funniest thing . We took up with different crowds ; Letitia became involved in an antique-music group and went off to New York over Christmas vacation . . . we drifted apart , as they say . We went our separate ways . " Emily could n't see why he was telling her this . She made an effort and sat straighter in her chair . " Is that right ? " she said . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . " " What happened , then ? " " Nothing happened , " Morgan said . " We just went our ways . No one knew about the elopement , after all . " Emily thought back over what he 'd told her . She said , " Rut then you 'd be a bigamist . " " Technically speaking , I suppose I am , " Morgan said cheerfully . " But that 's illegal ! " " Well , yes , I guess it is , in a way . " She stared at him . " But it 's really very natural , " he told her . " It 's quite fitting , when you stop to consider . Are n't we all sitting on stacks of past events ? And not every level is neatly finished off , right ? Sometimes a lower level bleeds into an upper level . Is n't that so ? " " Honestly , " Emily said . " What has this got to do withanything ? " She reached for her purse and stood up . Morganstood too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she was too quick for him . She did n't even wait for himro pay the cashier . She walked on out the door and left him the register , and he had to run to catch up with her . " Emily ? " he said . " I have to be getting home now . " " But I seem to have strayed from my point . All your talk of bigamy , legalities , you made me forget what I wanted to say . " Half the time , Morgan , " Emily said , " I believe you 're telling out-and-out lies . I believe you just told me one . You did , did n't you ? Did you ? Or not ? " " See , Emily , " Morgan said , " of course he 's changed . Everybodydoes ; everyone goes bobbing along , in and out of inlets , snagging on pilings , skating down rapids . . . Well , I must n't get carried away . But , Emily , you 're still close . You have n't parted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Alike ! " said Emily . She stopped in front of a newsstand . " How can you say that ? We 're totally different . We comeMORGAN 'S PASSINGfom totally different backgrounds . Even our religions are different . " " Really ? " said Morgan . " What religion is Leon ? " " Oh , Presbyterian , Methodist . . . " She started walking again . " We 're nothing at all alike . " " To me you are , " Morgan said . " And you get along so well . " " Ha , " said Emily bitterly . " You have the happiest marriage I know of , Emily . I love your marriage ! " " Well , I ca n't think why , " Emily said . But she let herself fall into step with him . They passed a woman painting her front door a bright green . " Apple green , my favorite color ! " Morgan called , and the woman laughed and bowed like someone on a stage . They passed an open window where Fats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan spread his arms and started dancing . The fact that he had a cigarette clamped in his teeth made it look difficult and precarious ; he reminded Emily of those Russians who dance with a glass of vodka on their heads . She stood to one side , awkwardly swinging her purse and smiling . Then Morgan stopped and took his cigarette from his mouth . " Why , look at that , " he said . He was staring at something just behind her . She turned , but it was nothing  --  a car parked next to a mailbox . " My car ! " he said . " Your what ? " " It 's my car ! " " Are you sure ? " But that was a silly question ; even Emily was sure . ( And why would he claim such a ruined object , otherwise ? ) Morganrushed around it , breathing rapid puffs of smoke . " See ? " he said . " There 's Lizzie 's tennis racket , my turban , my sailor suit that I was bringing home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been rolling up and down the back window ledge for the past six months . Or , " he said , pausing , " is it possible that someone else might have a car just like this ? " 35 " Really , Morgan , " Emily said . " Of course it 's yours . Go call the police . " " What for ? Why not just steal it back ? " " Well , you want the thief arrested , do n't you ? " " Yes , " he said , " but meanwhile it 's parked in a No Parking none and I might be given a ticket . " " When it was n't you that parked it there ? " " You never can tell , in this world , " he said . " I promised Bonny I would n't run up more traffic fines . " He was trying all the doors , but they were locked . He walked around to the front of the car and settled on his haunches before the grille . " I do n't suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " My what ? No . " He plucked at a string that was looped through the grille . then he set his face close and started gnawing at the string . I'he woman who 'd been painting lowered her brush and turned to watch . " I do n't understand what you 're after , " Emily said . " The key , " Morgan said . Something clinked to the ground . He groped beneath the car for it . " Over to your right , " Emily told him . " Closer to the wheel . " Morgan stretched out on his stomach , with his legs trailing behind him . ( The soles of his snake-proof boots were as deeply ridged as snow tires . ) He reached farther under the car . " Got it , " he said . A little three-wheeled mail truck the size of a golf cart bounced up and stopped . " Help ! " Morgan shouted , and he raised his head . She heard his helmet clang against the underside of the bumper . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm run over ! It 's my leg ! " A mailman descended from the truck , whistling , and started toward the mailbox . Emily grabbed his sleeve and said , " Move . " " Huh ? " " Move the truck ! You 've run a man over . " MORGAN 'S PASSING " Sheesh , " said the mailman . " Do n't he see the No Parking sign ? " " Move that truck this instant , I tell you ! " " All right , all right , " the mailman said . He turned back to his truck , glancing down at Morgan on the way . Morgan showed him a face that seemed all teeth . " Hurry , " said Emily , wringing a handful of skirt . Meanwhile the woman with the paintbrush arrived , drippingapple green . " Oh , that poor , poor man , " she said . Emily knelt next to Morgan . She had a sick weight on the floor of her stomach . But at least there was no blood . Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tire , looked flattened but still in one piece . He was breathing raggedly . Emily laid a hand on his back . " Are you in pain ? " she asked him . " Not as much as you might expect . " " He 's going to move the truck . " " Of all the damn-fool , ridiculous  --  " " Never mind , it could happen to anyone , " Emily said , patting his back . " I was talking about the mailman . " " Oh . " The mailman released his brake . The truck gave a grinding sound and inched backward . " Oof ! " said Morgan . He rolled free . He sat up and inspected his leg . A dusty , wedge-shaped mark ran down the green fabric . " Is it broken ? " Emily asked him . " I do n't know . " " Rip his pants , " the woman with the paintbrush suggested . " Not the pants ! " said Morgan . " They 're World War Two . " Emily started folding up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have to see . By now , two old ladies with shopping bags had joined them , and the mailman was telling them , " I could report him for illegal parking , if I was that bad of a guy . " " There 's nothing here , " Emily said . She was inspecting Morgan 's pale , hairy shin . " Can you wiggle your toes ? " 137 " Yes . " " Can you stand ? " He attempted it , with an arm around Emily for support . Ile was heavier than he looked , hard-muscled , warm , and he gave off the harsh gray smell of someone who 'd been smoking for a very long time . " Yes , " he said , " I can stand . " " Maybe he just ran over your trousers . " He drew back from her . " That 's not true at all , " he said . " But there 's no blood , the bone 's not broken ... " " I felt it . I felt the pressure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my calf . You think I do n't know when I 'm hit ? Not all hurts show up from outside . You ca n't just stand outside and pass judgment on whether I 've been injured or not . You think I do n't know when a U.S. Government mail truck pins me flat to the pavement ? " " Jesus , " said the mailman . The two old ladies went on their way , and the woman returned to her painting . The mailman unlocked the mailbox . Morgan held up a hand ; something glittered . " But at least I 've got the key , " he told Emily . " Oh , yes . The key . " He opened the door on the passenger side . " Quick . Jump in , " he said . " Me ? " " Jump in the car . What if the thief comes ? All this racket , this hullabaloo ... " He waited till she 'd climbed in , and then he closed the door and came around to the driver 's side . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her . " I do n't know why things ca n't go a little more smoothly . " He settled himself with a grunt and leaned forward to fit the key in the ignition . " Now look , " he said . " Another difficulty . " The key would n't go . A second key was already there , and a dangling leather case . " What are these ? " he asked Emily . " They must have been locked in the car , " she said . " I 'm always amazed , " Morgan said , " by how incompetent your average criminal is . " MORGAN 'S PASSING " But maybe the car was n't stolen at all , " Emily told him . " How could that be ? " " Maybe you just thought you parked in that other block . " " No , no , " he said impatiently . " That would be ridiculous . " He started the motor , veered out around the mail truck , and headed up the street . It sounded as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and meet Bonny , " he said . " Oh , Leon will be wondering where I am . And anyway , do n't you have to go to work ? " " I ca n't work today ; I only had an hour of sleep last night . It was Brindle , this business with Brindle . Have you ever heard of such a thing ? Robert Roberts , after all these years ! " Emily hoped he would n't start on Robert Roberts again . She felt exhausted . It seemed to her that those few blocks from Gina 's school had taken hours , days ; she 'd expended years ' worth of energy on them . The sight of Morgan beside her ( humming " I 'm Walkin ' " and tapping the steering wheel , fresh as a daisy , without a care in the world ) made her head ache . But then her apartment building approached . Crafts Unlimitedwas just opening , and its fluorescent lights were flutteringon and off as if unable to gather strength . The windows above it were dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an empty shell . Morgan sailed past , still humming . Emily did n't try to stop him. 2 Emily and Leon had given a good deal of thought to Morgan 's wife  --  to what she must be like , considering the amount of time he spent away from her . He was always dropping in on the Merediths for a visit , mentioning other places he 'd just come from and still others where he was heading afterward . Was he ever home at all , in fact ? Even weekends ? For on Saturdays he engaged in his own unique style of shopping . He would travel to the depths of Baltimore and return with unlikely items : dented canned goods , or39knobby packages wrapped in brown paper and tied all around with string in a dozen clumsy knots . ( You would think they had n't heard of bagging yet , where Morgan shopped . ) Sundayshe went to fairs and festivals . At events where Emily and Leon took their puppets , they might even run into him purely by chance . They 'd look through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long , low hillock  --  and find him standing at the rear , this sudden jutting peak topped by some outlandish hat , always alone , always brooding over something and puffing on a cigarette . ( But when they came out afterward to take their bows , he 'd be beaming mightily and clapping like a proud parent . ) Winters , when the fairs died down , he 'd go to church bazaars and grade-school fundraisers . No occasion was too small for him . He was never too busy to stop and contemplate the appliqued felt Christmastreeskirts or the Styrofoam snowmen with sequin eyes . So who was this Bonny , whom he was so eager to leave ? Maybe she nagged him , Leon said . Maybe she was one of those tight , crimped ladies holding court alone in her careful living room , among the polished figurines that Morgan must n't touch and the crystal ashtrays he must n't flick his ashes into . But Emily did n't think so . Putting together all that Morgan said ( his rush of accidents and disasters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she imagined Bonny as a slattern , in a zip-front housedress and a headful of pincurls . She was n't surprised when Morgan parked his car in front of a well-kept brick Colonial house  --  after all , she 'd known there was money , and slate tiles for the roof  --  but she blinked when she stepped out and found a brown-haired woman in a neat skirt and blouse weeding petunias along the front walk . Well , maybe it was the sister . But Morgan said , " Bonny ? " Bonny straightened and wiped her forehead with the back of her wrist . There were a few faint smile lines around her eyes . Her lipstick was a chipped , cracked , glossless red . She looked cheerful but noncommittal ; she seemed to be waiting for Morgan to explain himself . " Bonny , this is Emily Meredith , " Morgan said . MORGAN 'S PASSINGBonny went on waiting . " Emily and her husband run a puppet show , " Morgan said . " Oh , really ? " It had n't occurred to Emily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had heard of Bonny , after all . ) She felt a little hurt . She held out her hand and said , " How do you do , Mrs. Gower . " Bonny shook her hand . She said , " Well , are . . . you here to see Morgan ? Or what ? " " She 's here to see you , " Morgan told her . " Me ? " Morgan said , " What happened was , my car was stolen , but then I stole it back , by and by , but still there was so much excitement , what with Robert Roberts and all ... " " You mean , you asked her to come inside the house ? " " Oh ! " Emily said . " Well , of course I do n't want to interruptyour work . " " It 's all right , " Bonny said . " Why do n't you roll down your pants leg , Morgan ? " She turned to lead them up the walk . " But , Mrs. Gower  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bent position . He flattened his cuff around his ankle . " She 's just surprised . You 've come this far ; stay ! " Emily followed Bonny up the steps . She felt she had no choice , although she would rather have been anywhere else . They passed a clay pot in which herbs were growing  --  chives and maybe marjoram or thyme . Emily looked at them wistfully . Under other conditions , she thought , Bonny might very well have been someone she was fond of , but they 'd got started wrong . It was Morgan 's fault . He was so thoughtless and abrupt . She felt irritated by his dishpan-shaped helmet , bounding along beside her . " Notice Bonny 's roses , " he said . It could have been a hint  --  a clue to Bonny 's soft spot  --  but Bonny said , without turning , " How can she ? They 're not blooming yet . " The three of them entered the hall . On the radiator wereI 4 Ia stack of library books with scummy plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Triscuits . Emily had to watch her step through a little turmoil of shoes and sneakers , and by then they 'd reached the living room . " Look ! " Morgan said , pouncing on a vase . " This is what Amy made at camp , the summer she was ten . " " It 's very pretty , " Emily said . It was lopsided , and a crack ran down from the rim . " I wish you could meet her , but she lives in Roland Park now . You can meet Mother and Brindle , though . " " Brindle 's out shopping for a wedding ring , " Bonny said . " A ring ! Yes , I 've told Emily all about that . And see , here 's Molly 's picture on the mantel . Is n't she beautiful ? It 's from her school play ; they say she has a talent for acting . I ca n't imagine where she got it . There 's never been an actor in our family . What do you think of her ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ album ? " There was something feverish about him , Emily thought . Ile darted around the room , rummaging through various overloaded shelves . Emily and Bonny stood in the doorway watching him . Once they happened to glance at each other , but when Emily saw Bonny 's expression  --  oddly hooded  --  she looked away again . " Please , " she told Morgan , " I ought to be going . I 'll just catch a bus and go , please . " " But you have n't met my mother ! " he said , stopping short . " And I wanted Bonny to get to know you ; I wanted you two to . . . Bonny , Emily was in the paper today . " " Was she ? " Bonny said . " Where 's the paper ? Did you throw it out ? " " I think it 's in the kitchen . " " Come to the kitchen . Let 's all go ! Let 's all have some coffee , " he said . He raced away . Bonny straightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailed behind . She wished she could just vanish . She thought of ducking out soundlessly , slipping away before they noticed . She dodged a mobile of homemade paper sailing ships and stepped into the kitchen . MORGAN 'S PASSINGThe counters in the kitchen were stacked with dirty dishes , and several animals ' feeding bowls cluttered the floor . One wall was shingled with yellow cartoons and news clippings and hockey schedules , recipes , calendars , photographs , telephone numbers on torn corners of paper , dental appointment cards , invitations  --  even someone 's high-school diploma . Emilyfelt surrounded , flooded . Over by the back door Morgan was plowing through a stack of newspapers . " Where is it ? Where is it ? Did it come ? " he asked . " Aha ! " He held up a paper . He laid it flat on the floor , licked his thumb , and started turning pages . " News . . . editorials . . . crafts revivalin Baltimore ! " Peering over his shoulder , Emily saw Leon 's sober face . He seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bonny , here 's Leon . Emily 's husband , " 1/'Iorgan said . " And here 's her daughter , Gina . See ? " " Very nice , " said Bonny , setting out coffee cups . " You know , " Morgan said thoughtfully , " I once looked a little like Leon . " Bonny glanced at the photo . " Like that man there ? Never , " she said . " You 're two totally different types . " " Well , yes , " he said , " but there 's something about the eyes , maybe ; I do n't know . Or something around the mouth . Or maybe it 's the forehead . I do n't know . " He stood up , abandoning the paper , and pulled out a chair from the table . " Sit down , sit down , " he told Emily . He took a seat opposite , as if demonstrating , and fixed her with an urgent , focused look till she sat too . She felt trapped . The dishes on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might teeter and topple , swamping her . A typewriterstood in a puddle of orange juice on the table , with a sheet of paper in the carriage . . . . resolution was passed by ashow of hands , she read , and Matilda Grayson requested that ... Bonny placed a carton of cream in front of her and a crumpled sack of Pantry Pride sugar . " Were you working on something special ? " asked Emily , motioning toward the typewriter. 143 " Yes , " Bonny said . She handed Emily a cup of coffee and sat down next to her . " Um . . . what do you do for a living , Mrs. Gower ? " " I 'm Morgan 's wife for a living . " " Oh , I see . " " Yes , " Bonny said , " but do you see that it 's a full-time job ? It keeps me busy every minute , I tell you . Oh , from outside he seems so comic and light-hearted , such a character , so quaint , but imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the coping , stuck at home while he 's off somewhere , wondering who he thinks he is now . Do you suppose we could n't all act like that ? Go swooping around in a velvet cape with a red satin lining and a feathered hat ? That part 's the easy part . Imagine being his wife , finding a cleaner who does ostrich plumes . Keeping his dinner warm . Imagine waiting dinner while he 's out with one of his cronies that I have never I net  --  Salvation Army bums or astrologists or whatever other awestruck , smitten people he digs up . " Emily set her cup down . " You think I do n't appreciate him . You wonder why he married me , " Bonny said . " No , no , " said Emily . She looked across at Morgan , who seemed unperturbed . He was tipping contentedly in his chair , like a child who is confident he 's the center of attention , and puffing on a cigarette . Twisted ropes of smoke hung around his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . " Emily , Morgan is the manager of a hardware store . " Emily waited , but that was the end of it . Bonny seemed to be expecting her to speak . " Yes , " Emily said , after a minute . " Cullen Hardware , " Bonny said . " She knows that , Bonny , " Morgan said . " She does ? " Bonny stared at him . Then she asked Emily , " You do n't think he 's a . . . rabbi or a Greek shipping magnate ? " MORGAN 'S PASSING " No , " Emily said . She decided not to mention how they 'd met . Bonny pressed her fingers to her lips . There were freckles , Emily saw , dusting the back of her hand . After all , she was a pleasant woman ; she gave a little laugh . " You must think I 've lost my mind , " she said . " Crazy Bonny , right ? Morgan 's crazy wife , Bonny . " " Oh , no . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . . . misled . Morgan 's such a , well , prankster , in a way . " " Yes , I know about that . " " You do ? " Bonny said . She glanced over at Morgan . Morgan smiled seraphically and blew out a whoosh of smoke . " But I think he 's trying to give it up , " said Emily . " Oh , I hope so ! " Bonny said . " Why ! It takes so much ingenuity to manage some of that foolishness . . . think what he could accomplish if he used that brain for sensible things ! If he straightened out . If he decided to go straight . " " Not much , " said Morgan cheerfully . " What , dear ? " " There 's not much I could accomplish . What do you imagineI 'd be doing instead ? " " Oh , why ... just attending to things . I mean , attending to where you belong . " She turned to Emily . " There 's nothing wrong with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done well in hardware ; it 's nothing to be sneezed at . But Uncle 011ie says Morgan 's heart 's not in it . What 's the good of a store , he says , where you have to positively wrest the merchandisefrom the manager ? Assuming you can find the manager . I tell Uncle 011ie , Oh , leave him alone . Cullen Hardwareis not the be-all and end-all , ' I tell him , but it 's true that Morgan could get more narrowed in . He does n't know how to say no . He never refuses to be swept along . " " Mostly it 's muscles , " Morgan said . This must have been something he 'd told her before ; Bonny145rolled her eyes at Emily . Morgan turned to Emily and repeatedit . " It 's a matter of muscles , " he said . " I do n't understand . " " A matter of following where they lead me . Have you ever gone out to the kitchen , say , and then forgotten what for ? You stand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes a little twisting motion . Oh , yes ! you say . That twist is what you 'd do to turn a faucet on . You must have come for water ! I just trust my muscles , you see , to tell me what I 'm here for . To drop me into my true activity one day . I let them lead me . " " He lets them lead him into saying lie 's a glassblower , " Bonny said , " and a tugboat captain for the Curtis Bay TowingCompany , and a Mohawk Indian high-rise worker . And that 's just what I happen to hear ; heaven knows what more there is . " Her lips twitched , as if she were hiding some amusement . " You 're walking down the street with him and this total stranger asks him when the International Brotherhoodof Magicians is meeting next . You 're listening to a politician 's speech and suddenly you notice Morgan on the platform , sitting beside a senator 's wife with a carnation in his buttonhole . You 're waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter but Morgan in a rubber apron , telling the other customers where he caught such fine oysters . It seems he has this boat that was handed down from an uncle on his mother 's side , a little bateau with no engine  --  " " Engines disturb the beds , " said Morgan . " And I do n't like mechanical tonging rigs , either . What was good enough for my uncle on my mother 's side is good enough for me , I say . " Bonny smiled at him and shook her head . " You step out for two minutes to buy milk , leaving him safe home in his pajamas , and coming back you pass him on the corner in a satin cap and purple satin shirt , telling four little boys the secret that made him the only undefeated jockey in the history of Pimlico . A jockey , six feet tall ! Why do they allMORGAN 'S PASSINGbelieve him ? He never used a crop , you see , but only whispered in the horse 's ear . He whispered something that sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Scintillate , " Morgan said . " Oh , yes , " said Bonny . She laughed . Morgan trotted in his chair , holding imaginary reins . " Scintillate , scintillate , " he whispered , and Bonny laughed harder and wiped her eyes . " He 's impossible , " she told Emily . " He 's just . . . impossible to predict , you see . " " I can imagine he must be , " Emily said politely . She was beginning to like Bonny ( her pink , merry face , and the helpless way she sank back in her chair ) , but she thought less of Morgan . It had never occurred to her that he knew exactly how people saw him , and that he enjoyed their astonishment and perhaps even courted it . She frowned at him . Morgan pulled his nose reflectively . " She 's right , " he said . " I make things difficult . But I plan to change . Hear that , Bonny ? " " Oh , do you , now ? " Bonny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't know what to make of my garden , " she said , looking out at the yard . " I was certain I 'd planted vegetables someplace , but it seems to be coming up all flowers . " " I mean it , " Morgan said . He told Emily , " She does n't believe me . Bonny , do n't you see what 's here in front of you ? Here 's Emily Meredith ; I brought her home . I brought her to our house . I told her and Leon , both , exactly who I was . I told about you and the girls . They know about Amy 's new baby and the time Kate smashed the car . " " Is that right ? " Bonny asked Emily . Emily nodded . " Well , I ca n't think what for , " Bonny said . " I ca n't think why he bored you with all that . " " I 'm combining my worlds ! " Morgan said , and he raised his coffee cup to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it somewhere . There 's something missing . I do n't understand what he wants . " Emily did n't understand either . She shook her head ; Bonny shook hers . In fact , it seemed that Bonny and Emily were the old friends and Morgan was the newcomer . He sat slightly apart , perched under his helmet like an elf under a mushroom , turning his face from one to the other while the women watched , narrow-eyed , to see what he was up to. 19751 Even when Morgan fell asleep , he did n't truly lose consciousness . Part of him slept while the rest of him stayed alert and jittery , counting things  --  thumbtacks , mattress buttons , flowers on a daughter 's dress , holes in a pegboard display of electrical fittings . A plumber came in and ordered some pipes : six elbows and a dozen nipples . " Certainly , " said Morgan , but he could n't help laughing . Then he was competing in a singing contest . He was singing a song from the fifties called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but was unable to pronounce them properly . The ballroom prize we almost won came out the barroom brawl we almost won . I ! is partner was not a good dancer anyway , and in fact theyMORGAN 'S PASSINGwere nowhere close to winning . Why ! His partner was Laura Lee Keller , the very first girl he had ever loved  --  someone he had lost track of long , long before the days of " Moments to Remember . " After the prom , he and Laura Lee had driven to the beach with half the senior class and lain kissing on a blanket by the ocean . Still , even now , even after all these years , the sound of the ocean reminded him of possibilities unfolding : everything new and untried yet , just around the corner . He opened his eyes and heard the ocean just a few blocks distant , the very same ocean he 'd lain beside with Laura Lee , but he himself was middle-aged and irritable and so was Laura Lee , he supposed , wherever she was ; and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night before . It was six o'clock in the morning in Bethany Beach , Delaware , in the buckling tarpaper cottage they rented from Uncle 011ie every July . Tongue-and-groove walls , painted a dingy blue too long ago , rose high above the swaybacked bed . A tattered yellow shade rustled in the window . ( Where else but near the ocean would you see this kind of window  --  the cheap aluminum frame stippled by salt air , the bellying screen as soft and sleazy as some synthetic fabric ? Where else would the screen doors and porches have those diagonal wooden insets at the corners , so that no right angles appeared to exist within earshot of the Atlantic ? ) The room was full of castoffs : a looming wardrobe faced with a flecked , metallic mirror ; a bow-fronted bureau topped with a mended dresser scarf ( every one of the drawers stuck , and several of the cut-glass knobs were missing ) ; a pink shag rug as thin and wrinkled as a bathmat ; and a piecrust table beside the bed with a cracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Morgan sat up and switched on the radio . He had just missed the Six O'Clock Sermonette ; Guy and Ralna were singing " What a Friend We Have in Jesus . " Next to him , Bonny stirred and said , " Morgan ? What on earth . . . ? " He lowered the volume a little . He inched out of bed , took a sombrero from the wardrobe , and put it on without look-I 5 Iing in the mirror . Barefoot , in his underpants , he slogged down the hall to the kitchen . Already the air was so warm and heavy that he felt used up . The cottage had four bedrooms , but only three were occupied . His mother slept in the second and Kate , their last remaining child , in the third . It used to be that the place was overflowing . The girls would share beds and couches ; Brindle roomed with Louisa ; various daughters ' boyfriends lined up in sleeping bags out on the porch . Morgan had complained of the confusion at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was in coming any more . Kate was hardly present  --  she was eighteen years old now , busy with her own affairs , forever off visiting friends in the ugly new condominium south of town . As for Louisa , the trip seemed to shake her memory loose ; she was even more dislocated than usual . Only Bonny appeared to enjoy herself . She padded along the shoreline with a bucket , hunting shells . The bridge of her nose developed a permanent pink , peeling patch . Sometimes she sat at the edge of the breakers and dabbled like a child , with her legs in a V  --  a rash of red on top , pale underneath . Then Morgan would pace the sand just behind her with his thumbs hooked in the waistband of his trunks , braving the sun and the sticky spray , for he was never comfortablewhen a member of his family was in the water . He considered swimming ( like sailing , like skiing ) to be unnatural , a rich person 's contrivance to fill up empty hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroke , with his mouth tightly closed , not wetting so much as the tip of his beard ) , he would never swim just for pleasure . And he would surely never swim in the ocean . His distrust of the ocean was logical and intelligent , he felt . He kept sensibly away from the edge , wearing stout shoes and woolen socks at all times . He only listened to the breakers , and plummeted into a deep , slow trance where once again he lay with Laura I.ee Keller on a blanket beneath the stars . It was too hot for coffee , but he 'd get a headache if he tried to do without it . He made instant , using water straight fromMORGAN 'S PASSINGthe tap . Beneath the taste of Maxwell House and sugar he caught the thick , dark taste of beach water , but he drank it anyway , from a jellyglass painted with clowns . Then he rinsed the glass . Then he took Bonny 's purse from the kitchen table and put it in the freezing compartment of the refrigerator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in resort towns , crime does not exist . Morgan knew better . He sensed danger all around , and would have felt more secure in the heart of Baltimore . ) He went back to the bedroom and found Bonny sitting against her pillow . " What are you up so early for ? " she asked him . " And why was the radio on ? " " I wanted to hear the news , " he said . It was n't true ; he never felt the news had anything to do with him . What he 'd wanted was to drown out the sound of the ocean . This was Tuesday . They 'd been here three days . There were eleven days remaining . He sighed and sat on the edge of the bed to pull his socks on . " I 'll bring breakfast from the bakery , " he told Bonny . " Anything you want while I 'm in town ? " " The bakery 's not open yet . " " I 'll go and wait . I 'll buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , bring some of those bow-tie things with cherries , then ... " She yawned and ruffled her hair . A pillow mark ra down her left cheek . " Lucky you , " she said . " You fe asleep right away , last night . " " I had a terrible sleep . " " You fell asleep instantly . " " But the whole night long I dreamed , " Morgan said , " and woke , and checked the clock . I ca n't remember now what I dreamed . A man in a tailcoat stepped out of the wardrobc . I think this house is haunted , Bonny . " " You say that every year , " Bonny told him . " Well , it 's haunted every year . " He pulled a striped T-shi over his head . When he emerged , he said , " All these wakeful nights , peculiar thoughts . . . the most I hope for , from vacation , is a chance to rest up once it 's over . " 153 " Today 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bed . Morgan zipped his hiking shorts , which were new and full of pockets and flaps that he had n't yet explored . Attached to one pocket was a metal clasp . It was probably meant for a compass . " I do n't suppose you brought along a compass , " he told Bonny . " Compass ? " He glanced at her . She was standing before the wardrobe in a short , plain nightgown that he happened to be fond of . I le was even fond of the grapy veins in her calves , and her rumpled knees . He considered slipping up to kiss the pulse in her throat , but then he felt laden by the heat and the waves and the tongue-and-groove walls . " Ah , God . I have to do something about this life of mine , " he said . " What about it ? " she asked , sliding a blouse off a hanger . " It 's come to nothing . It 's come to nothing . " She looked over at him , and parted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But then he said , " Bow-tie pastries , right ? With cherries . " He was gone before she could ask whatever it was she had planned. 2 With one hand under his mother 's elbow , he steered her along the boardwalk . It was nearly noon , and she wore a great black cartwheel of a hat to guard against sunburn . Her striped terry beach robe was long-sleeved and ankle-length , and it concealed not a bathing suit but an ordinary street dress , for she could no more swim than fly , she always said . Her face was pale and pursed , even in this heat , and her fingertipswere cold when she touched his arm . She touched his arm to tell him to stop for a second . She wanted to look at a house that was under construction . " What an unusual shape , " she said . " It 's called an A-frame , " Morgan said . MORGAN 'S PASSING " Why , it 's practically all garret . " Morgan summoned his thoughts together . At moments like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surroundings , he always made an effort to have a real conversation with her . " The cost , " he said , " is considerably lower than for other houses , I believe . " " Yes , I should think so , " she said . She patted his arm again , and they walked on . She said , " Let 's see now . How long have we been here ? " " Three days , Mother . " " Eleven more to go , " she said . " Yes . " She said , " Heavens . " " Maybe our family was n't cut out for vacations , " Morgan said . " Maybe not . " " It must be the work ethic , " he said . " Well , I do n't know what that is . It 's more like we vacation all year round on our own . " " How can you say that ? " Morgan asked . " What about my hardware store ? " She did n't answer . " We 're city people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , things to keep us busy . . . It 's dangerous , lolling around like this . It 's never good just to loll around and think . Why , you and Father never vacationed in your lives . Did you ? " " I do n't recall , " she said . She would not remember anything about his father , ever . Sometimes Morgan wondered if her failing memory for recentevents might stem from her failing memory of her husband ; selective forgetfulness was an impossibility , maybe . Having chosen to forget in one area , she had to forget in all others as well . He felt a sudden urge to jolt her . He wanted to ask : am I aging in the same direction my father did ? hay e I journeyed too far away from him ? am I too near ? what d .. I have to go on , here ? I 'm traveling blind ; I 'm older now thant 5 5muy own father ever lived to be . Instead , he asked , " Did n't you and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't know , " she said primly . " Jesus ! You 're so stubborn ! " he shouted , slapping his thigh . I lis mother remained unmoved , but two girls walking ahead in bikinis looked over their shoulders at him . " Do you ever think how I must feel ? " he asked his mother . " Sometimes I feel I 've just been plunked here . I have no one from the old days ; I 'm just a foreigner on my own . You ca n't count Brindle ; she 's so much younger , and anyway so wrapped up in that husband of hers ... " " But there 's always me , " his mother said , picking her way around a toddler with a bucket . " Yes , " he said , " but often you sort of . . . vacate , Mother ; you 're not really there at all . " He had hurt her feelings . He was glad of it only for an instant ; then he felt deeply remorseful . His mother raised her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where beach towels flapped on the balcony railing . " Why ! " she said . " Was n't that speedy . " " What was , Mother dear ? " " They 've finished construction on the A-frame , " she said . " It seems like no time at all . " And she jutted her chin at him with a triumphant , bitter glare . " So it does , dear heart , " he said. 3 Morgan went out to get a pizza for their supper and returned to find that Bonny 's brother had arrived . He 'd brought his new wife , Priscilla , a pretty girl with short , straight blond hair caught back in a silver barrette . They had been married only a few weeks . They wore similar crisp , new-looking white slacks and pastel shirts , like honeymooncrs , Morgan had n't even met Priscilla up till now  --  or people seemed to assume he had n't , for Billy introduced her and sheMORGAN 'S PASSINGshook Morgan 's hand formally . Bonny said , " Priscilla went to Roland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , yes , " Morgan said , but the truth of the matter was , he could have sworn that Billy had been married to Priscilla once before . He seemed to remember her . He thought she might even have visited this cottage . But she acted as if everythingwere new to her . " What a sweet place , " she said . " What a lot of . . . character , " and she walked around the living room fingering the seashell ashtrays like a stranger , and peering at the photograph of Uncle 011ie 's 1934 lacrosse team , and reading all the titles on the Reader 's Digest book condensations . Morgan was cagy ; he went along with it . Then as soon as possible he cornered Bonny , who had taken the pizza out to the kitchen . " Bonny , " he whispered , " is n't that girl an ex-wife of his ? " " No , dear , she 's his present wife . " " But did n't Billy marry her another time , earlier ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know he did , " he said . " He married her and brought her here ; it was the same time of year . " Bonny straightened up from the oven . She looked hot ; the hair around her temples was damp . She said , " Morgan , I am not in the mood for any of your jabs at my brother . " " Jabs ? What jabs ? " " Just because he may have a fondness for one particular type of girl  --  " Bonny said . " I 'm not talking types , Bonny . I mean this . He brought her here several years ago and she had that little dog Kelty , Kilty , ... why deny it ? There 's nothing wrong with marrying her twice . Lots of people go back , retrace , try to get it right the second time around . Why cover it up ? " She only sighed and returned to the living room . Morgan followed her . He found Billy and Priscilla on the wicker couch , talking with Morgan 's mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his bald pink skull , his pale hair straggling behind his ears . He had hold of one of Pris-157cilia 's hands and was stroking it , like something trapped , in his lap . Priscilla was pretending the hand did not belong to her . She leaned forward earnestly , listening to Louisa discuss the drive to Bethany . " I took along a thermos of Lipton tea , " Louisa said , " and two nice , juicy nectarines , and a box of arrowrootbiscuits that Bonny sometimes buys for my digestion . " Priscilla nodded , her face alight with interest and enthusiasm . She was very young . She could n't possibly have been married several years ago ; several years ago she would still have been a schoolgirl in a royal-blue Roland Park Country School jumper . Morgan felt confused . He sat down in a rockingchair . Louisa said , " Traffic was held up on the Bridge , so we stopped and I got out and sat in the grass by the side of the road . There was a little boy there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my nectarines with him and he gave me a nice speckle pear . " " Seckel pear , " Morgan murmured . He could not bear to have her laughed at . " A speckle pear , this one was . I finished half of it and put the other half in a Baggie . Then we got back in the car and drove across the Bridge , but in Delaware we stopped again where the Kiwanis Club was barbecuing chickens and I had half a chicken , a Tab , and a sack of potato chips . They were out of bread-and-butter pickles . At Farmer John 's Vegetable Stand ... " Priscilla 's purse was one of those button-on things with a wooden handle . Bermuda bags , he believed they were called . You could button on an infinity of different covers to match different outfits . He would bet that her suitcase was full of covers  --  seersucker pink , yachting blue . . . he lost his train of thought . He wondered what had possessed him to leave his camera at home , hanging by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in twenty years he would not have pictures of their vacation . On the other hand , what was the use of such pictures ? They were only the same , year after year . Same waves , same sunburns , same determined smiles .. . MORGAN 'S PASSING " After we reached Bethany , I started feeling a little peckish , so I walked to the market with Kate and picked out a watermelon . It was a wonderful melon , really fat and thumpy-sounding , and once we got it back to the cottage all we had to do was touch a knife point to it and it crackled all the way open . But it had no taste . Can you believe it ? Had no taste whatsoever . Such a lovely color and not a scrap of taste . I just do n't understand that , " Morgan 's mother said . Morgan suddenly remembered another of last night 's dreams . He 'd been standing on a lawn beside a beautiful , graceful woman he 'd never seen before . She led him toward a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled on it  --  the woman sitting , Morgan standing , enclosing her with his feet . They started swinging over a cliff . Tiny yellow flowers dotted a field far below them . Morgan knew that when they were swinging high enough , they would leap . He would die . He was n't upset about it . Then the woman tipped her head back against him , and he felt the length of her between his legs  --  the curve of her ribcage , the satiny coolness of her clothing . He was like a boy again , trembling . He saw that as long as he felt this way , he wanted to go on living , and all at once he was afraid of the leap . He woke abruptly , with his heart beating so hard that his whole body seemed to vibrate. 4 In the past few years Morgan had become a letterwriter . He could n't have said exactly why . It justseemed , sometimes , that he grew restless and ill-contained ; hecould n't sit still ; there was something he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was and he had no particularperson in mind . Then he would sit down and write letters  --  although even that was not quite it ; it was only secondbest . At work , he used his Woodstock typewriter , which produced an uneven , sooty print that danced all over the page . He plodded away with two index fingers , stopping after everyword or so to pry up the A key , which would n't spring back159on its own . At home , he wrote with a leaky fountain pen whose cartridge he refilled with a plastic hypodermic needle . ( He 'd salvaged the needle from an emergency-room wastebasketduring one of the children 's accidents . Buying cartridges already filled was an extravagance , he felt . ) He wrote all his daughters , even those still living in Baltimore . He wrote the traveling salesmen who came to the store , and his friends Kazari and the Greek tavern-keeper . Because he did not often have anything to say , he gave advice , as a rule .

Or : Dear Amy , I notice that you appear to be experiencing some difficulty with household clutter . Understand that I 'm not blaming you for this , your mother has the same problem . But as I 've been telling her for years , there is a solution . Simply take a cardboard box , carry it through the rooms , load into it everyone 's toys and dirty clothes and such , and hide it all in a closet . If people ask for some missing object , you 'll be able to tell them where it is . If they do n't ask ( now , here is the important part ) , if a week goes by and they do n't notice the object is gone , then you can be sure it 's non-essential , and you throw it away . You would be surprised at how many things are non-essential . Throw everything away , all of it ! Simplify ! Do n't hesitate ! All my love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to bed , Morgan sat at the kitchen table and wrote a postcard to Potter , the musical-instrument man . . . . weather has been fair and warm , a high in the 8o 's all three days . . . must thank the good lord for in Rehoboth I hear they had r 3/4 inches of **27;7946;TOOLONG milestone along that historic route was recorded by a photographon Agnew 's wall . Harold Agnew himself was one of the few men still alive of the score of scientists who had been present at the birth of the Atomic Age in a converted squash court under the west stands of the University of Chicago 's Stagg Field on a bitter cold November day in 1942 . He was a big , burly blond man with sloping shoulders and heavy arms , a man who looked as if he should have been a second-generationSwede running a gas station in northern Minnesota rather than the director of one of the most sophisticated scientific institutions in the world . When he had marched up the mesa sprawled below him with Oppenheimer and Groves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on planet Earth could have fit on the head of a pin with room left over for a flight of angels to dance . And now ? Agnew thought moodily , contemplating those blinking lights . That was a question which had come naturally during the trials of the last hour while a team of his weapons designers had labored over the blueprintdelivered to the White House gate . They had broken the blueprint down into its components , picking it apart , hunting the one fatal flaw , the one violation of the very precise rules of nuclear weaponry which would render the design meaningless . Outside his office , on the huge Los Alamos computer banks , other men had run off the formulas that had come in with the design , checking neutron densities , heating factors , lens curvatures against the figuresstored on the computer . As the minutes had gone by , Agnew 's thoughts had frequently gone back to that exalting morning in Chicago almost forty years ago . He 'd been down on the atomic pile with two friends and an ax that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a cadmium solution if the reaction ran away  --  and if they were still alive to cut it . Enrico Fermi , the great Italian physicist , had been up on the balcony calmly giving orders in his rich tenor voice . The counter had started to go wild , running faster and faster like a heart fibrillating . Nothing had shaken the Italian 's composure . Finally he had taken out his slide rule , made a series of quick movements , then nodded his head and said , " It 's self-sustaining . " With those words , mankind had entered the era of the atom . For Agnew , the exaltation , the exhilaration of that great moment40were as alive now as they had been then . They had known at that instant they could beat the Germans to their terrible goal . But , above all , they had shared the conviction that man had mastered at last the elements of his globe , harnessed to his own ends its most primeval force . The rasp of his buzzer interrupted him just as the last pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We have your call to the White House , " his deputy announced . The scientist sighed and picked up the phone . The incoming call was switched to the small white squawk box in the center of the oval table so that everyone in the National Security Council conference room could hear and address the scientist at Los Alamos . " Mr. Agnew , " Jack Eastman declared , " have your people completedtheir appraisal of the atomic bomb on those blueprints ? " The voice filtering into the room through the white plastic holes in reply seemed strangely hesitant . " Mr. Eastman , the drawing on the blueprint which you submittedto us is not for an atomic bomb . " The men in the White House emitted what seemed an almost collective sigh of relief . The distant scientist did not hear them . He continued . " It 's my very sad duty to inform you that the design on the blueprint is for something a hundred times worse . " A quick , nervous gasp in the distant scientist 's voice was audible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basement . The blueprint is for a thermonuclear device , Mr. President , a threemegatonhydrogen bomb . " Every time his bare fingertips touched the metal of the television antenna , the passenger of the Dionysos felt a numbing flash of pain spurt down his fingers to his wrists . Beneath him his feet , unaccustomed to snow and ice , slipped and skidded on the half-frozen mounds left on the exposed rooftop by Friday 's snowstorm . Warily , he glanced at the buildings around him . There was no light burning in any window from which someone could see what he was doing. 4Off to his right was the river . With a compass , he fixed his television antenna at a very precise angle pointing toward its black expanse . She had followed her instructions perfectly in picking the building . There were no rooftops higher then his along the antenna'scarefully calculated line of vision , nothing that could block an incoming radio signal . He took the six-foot needle of phosphorated bronze , smaller than an automobile aerial but capable of discerning the weakest burst of electronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it in the television antenna . Every few seconds he had to stop to blow on his numbed fingertips , to give them the sense of precision they needed to make the connection he had practiced a hundred times between the aerial and the antenna . When he had finished , he straightened up , stiff with cold , rubbing the aching scar on his neck as he did . Suddenly , from the street below , the clatter of voices drifted up to his rooftop . He peered down . Half a dozen people spilled out of the artist 's loft across the street . Impassively , he watched them glide off through the shadows , his ears following the crystalline ripple of the girls ' laughter as it faded in the night . The President was the first person in the National SecurityCouncil conference room to break the shocked silence that had followed Harold Agnew 's revelation . " My God ! " he gasped . " Is this really possible ? That Qaddafi could have done this without our finding out what he was up to ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bomb representedthe ultimate refinement in man 's search for the means of self-destruction . Unlike the atomic bomb , which depended on convertingto reality a widely understood scientific theory , it depended on the most potent secret unlocked by man 's brain since the cavemenof antiquity had harnessed fire . It involved the one precisely perfect interweaving of the bomb 's key elements . There was only one . There was no " almost . " There was no margin whatsoever for error . That relationship was probably the most ferociously guarded secret on earth . Thousands , hundreds of thousands , of qualified physicists understood the theory of the atomic bomb . Barely three hundred people , perhaps fewer , were privy to the secret of the hydrogen bomb. 42 " I admit it strains credibility , sir , " Agnew replied , " but the blunt fact is that this is a viable weapons design . Whether it 's from Qaddafi or someone else , someone , somewhere out there , has gottenhold of the secret of the hydrogen bomb . " Exploding a hydrogen bomb was a task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ log ablaze with a single match . It requiredputting three competing processes into perfect balance under conditions of temperature and pressure so extreme they rivaledthose at the core of the sun . Essentially what was involved were two atomic " triggers " on either side of a mass of thermonuclearfuel enclosed in a liquid membrane of tritium . Their explosionallowed for the perfectly symmetrical compression of the fuel which the tritium helped to drive up to the incredible temperatures needed for ignition . The entire assembly was wrapped in a cylinder of uranium 238 which turned some of the neutrons fleeing the atomic explosion back into the device , delaying its disintegration for the microsecond required to allow the whole process to take place . " The device is meant to be contained in a cylinder roughly the size of an ordinary oil drum , " Agnew continued . " The length is about half again as long as a drum . We calculate it would weigh almost fifteen hundred pounds . There are connecting wires meant , I presume , to be hitched up to some kind of separate control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio burst and release an electrical impulse into the high-explosive charge . " For several seconds there was not a sound in the conference room . The President cleared his throat . " Where in God 's name would someone like Qaddafi have gotten the information to build something like this ? Could he have gotten it from those articles that were published in Wisconsin in 1979 ? " " No . " This time Agnew did not hesitate . " Those articles set out the theory behind the H bomb very completely . But they did n't come to grips with the precise formula behind it , which is that absolutely perfect quantitive and qualitative interrelationship betweenits three competing elements . Without that , you 've got no explosion . " " And this design has that ? " " Yes , Mr. President , I 'm sorry to have to tell you the configurationhere is exact . " Jack Eastman leaned forward toward the squawk box . " Mr.43Agnew , I want to be very precise . What we 're dealing with here is a design , a blueprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imponderablesin here we have n't talked about that could prevent this from going off ? " " Of course there are , " Agnew replied . " Everything depends , for example , on those atomic triggers exploding with perfect synchronization , and that in turn depends on detonating with absolute precision the high explosives that set them off . It 's a very , very complicated process . " The President coughed . " Mr. Agnew , " he asked , " assuming for the moment this device really existed and really was in New York and really was exploded , what would its effect be ? " For a long moment , the little squawk box in the center of the table was silent . Then , almost as though they came from some disembodied voice speaking from another world , Agnew 's words again filled the room . " It would mean , sir , that , for all practical purposes , New York City would be wiped off the face of the earth . " " Hey , lady , got room in there for me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a young Marine waiting to board the Eastern Airlines nine-o'clock shuttle from New York to Washington . Lasciviously , he eyed her figure swathed in her ankle-length red fox fur coat as she swept past him . Laila Dajani was used to men 's passes . With her long auburn hair , her black prominent eyes , the slight sensual pout of her wellfleshedlips , she had been attracting them since she was eighteen . She gave a casual toss to her hair and continued on to the shuttle terminal from the plane that had just flown her into the city from the nation 's capital . Her beauty , the way she invariably stood out in a crowd , was , she knew , a risk . To deliver her letter to the White House , she had worn the blond wig and an old polo coat which she had left in the second locker she had opened at National Airport . She moved casually to the exit , spotting at the door the darkcoateddriver of the limousine service she had used regularly since she arrived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lovely . thank you . " 44Laila settled into the car 's comfortable upholstery . As they pulled away , she took out her compact and , pretending to adjust her makeup , scrutinized the traffic behind them in the mirror . They were not , as far as she could tell , being followed , She sank back into the seat and lit a cigarette . The car and the driver were a reflection of one of Carlos 's golden rules : a smart terrorist always travels first class . The best way to slip undetected about the world , the Venezuelan master terrorist maintained , was in that **25;7975;TOOLONG which lay just below the level of the ostentatiousrich , at the very heart of the society he meant to destroy . The cover he had invented for Laila 's two visits to the United States was ideally designed to accomplish just that . She was on a buying trip for La Rive Gauche , a boutique for wealthy Lebanese on Beirut 's Hamra Street , an institution which had survived , as such places inevitably do , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's elegant proprietor , the widow of a famous Druze chieftain , was a passionate supporter of the cause , an engaging woman who saw no contradiction in selling Dior , Yves SaintLaurentand Courreges dresses by day and preaching violent revolutionby night . Getting a fake Lebanese passport had been simple . Procuring stolen Lebanese passports for Palestinian terroristswas as easy in Beirut as buying postage stamps . Nor did she have the slightest difficulty in getting one of the 200,000 U.S. visas issued annually in the Middle East . The overworked consul who had given her her visa had n't even bothered to make a phone call to check on her assumed identity ; the Rive Gauche letter supportingher application had been enough for him . And so , as Linda Nahar , a Lebanese Christian , she had haunted the showrooms of Bill Blass , Calvin Klein and Oscar de la Renta on her two trips to New York , the first in August , the second beginning in November . She had gjickly become one of the newest ornaments of a certain New York world , weekending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the garish splendorof Studio 54 . The driver braked to a stop in front of the Hampshire House on Central Park South . She dismissed the car , picked up three messagesat the reception desk and two minutes later stepped into the charming disorder of the suite she rented by the month on the thirty-second floor . It was littered with the impedimenta of her45assumed calling : fashion brochures , copies of Vogue , Harper 's Bazaar , Glamour , Women 's Wear Daily . Indeed , her photograph in Women 's Wear at Diana Vreeland 's Pageant of Chinese Dress for the Met had caused Laila a moment of anguish . Fortunately for her , Women 's Wear was not a journal scrutinized with any intensityby the CIA 's Office of Palestinian Affairs . She tossed her coat on a chair and mixed herself a drink . Moodily , she stepped to the window onto Central Park that constituted one of the sitting-room walls . Looking at the park in its pristine mantle of new snow , at the skaters gliding over the shell to her right , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Laila shuddered unavoidably . She took a long swallow of her whiskey and thought of Carlos . He was right . Never think of the consequences of your mission , he warned , only of the unexpected problems that could prevent you from carrying it out . She drained her glass with two thirsty gulps and walked to her bathroom to draw a bath . Before stepping into the tub , she gave herself an approving glance in the mirror : the taut , flat stomach , her firm buttocks , the defiant thrust of her breasts . For a long moment she lay there , luxuriating in the bath , caressing her skin with the bath oil 's thick , bubbly film , rubbing it through her earlobes , along the passagewaysof her neck , massaging it playfully over her breasts until her nipples stood erect . Lazily , she lifted one leg from the bath water and rubbed the foam along her thighs and inner legs . At the sight of her crimson toenails , she smiled . Imagine , she mused , a terrorist who paints her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hair when the phone rang . Picking it up , she heard the din of voices in the background . " Where the devil are you ? " she asked , a flashing undertone of anger in her voice . " We 're having dinner at Elaine 's . " Her expression changed the instant she heard the caller 's voice . " We 're going on to the Fiftyfour . Why do n't you join us ? " What better cover could she ask for ? " Can you give me an hour ? " Laila asked with a husky voice . " An hour ? " the voice answered . " I 'd give you a lifetime if you 'd take it . " .16His usually bland features shrouded with concern , the President of the United States stared at the circle of advisers surroundinghim . The last great crisis his nation had faced when the fanatical supporters of the Ayatollah Khomeini had seized the U.S. Embassy in Teheran paled beside this threat . This was the ultimate act of political terrorism , the almost too inevitable conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected bitterly , if this really was true , a nation whose citizens were living in nomad tents barely a generation ago now possessed the power to destroy the most important city on the planet . Millions of people are being held hostage , he thought , to the extravagant demands of a zealous despot . He turned to Jack Eastman . " Jack , what contingency plans do we have to handle something like this ? " It was a question Eastman had anticipated . Locked in a safe in the West Wing were the contingency plans of the U.S. government , all constantly updated , each wrapped in its black imitationleatherjacket with gold lettering . They covered everything : the speed with which the U.S. and the Soviets could reach comparable firepower thresholds , possible Chinese reactions , NATO disagreements , the security of the sea lanes , right down to how many C rations were necessary to deploy the 82nd Airborne Division into the Panama Canal Zone or land a division of Marines on Cyprus . Their origins went back to Henry Kissinger 's days . Eastman had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imaginable world crisis  --  every one , that is , except the one which now confrontedthe President of the United States . " I 'm sorry , sir , " Eastman replied , " we do n't have any . " Eastman noted the flicker his words produced in the President 's blue eyes , the " laser look , " the familiar warning that he was angry . He had folded his hands on the table before him . " All right , " he said . " In any event , whether this is from Qaddafi , whether it 's from some terrorist group , some crazy scientist , or someone else , I wish to make one thing clear to you all : the fact that this threat , real or not , exists is to be kept an absolute secret . " The President 's words reflected a U.S. government decision , taken during the Nixon administration and consistently adhered to since then , to avoid at all costs going public with nuclear threats . The knowledge that a threat existed in a given city could provoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Discrediting each nuclear hoax cost at least a million47dollars , and no one wanted to see the government deluged by such threats . There was the danger that an irrational , semihysterical public opinion could paralyze the government 's ability to act in such a crisis . And in this case , the President was well aware , there was yet another reason : the ominous injunction to secrecy in the threat note . " Well , if this really is from Qaddafi our answer 's simple . " It was Delbert Crandell , the Secretary of Energy . " Lather those bastards from one end of Libya to the other . That 's all . Wipe them out . Lay the Trident missiles on the subs we have on patrol in the Med on them . That 'll turn the damn place into a sea of glass in thirty seconds . There wo n't be a goat left alive over there . " Crandell sank back , satisfied . His words had a cathartic effect on the room . It was as though the outspoken Energy Secretary had given voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been prepared to express , the brutal but reassuring affirmation that , in the final analysis , the United States possessed the power to squash a menace such as this . " Mr. Christopher . " The President 's tone was soft , sad almost , as he addressed the Deputy Secretary of State . " What is the population of Libya ? " " Two million , sir , give or take a hundred thousand . Census figuresover there are n't very reliable . " The President turned down the table toward the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs . " Harry , how many people would we lose if a threemegatondevice went off in New York ? Without evacuation ? " " Sir , it would be difficult to give you an accurate figure on that without looking at some numbers . " " I realize that , but give me your best estimate . " The Chairman reflected a moment . " Between four and five million , sir . " There was dead silence as the awful mathematics of Fuller 's figures registered on everyone in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute in a private thought no one in the room dared to interrupt . The giants of the world , the United States and the USSR , held each other in strategic checkmate because they shared a parity of horror , an equilibrium once described with almost too perfect irony by the acronym for the philosophy on which the 11 . S. 's thermonuclear strategy had been based  --  MAD , for " MutualAssured Destruction . " I kill you , you kill me . It was the old Russian comedy , everybody dies . But this , if it was true , was the terrible alteration in the rules of the game that had haunted responsible world leaders for years , the end game in the struggle against nuclear proliferation for which he had fought so hard  --  and with so little success . Detective First Grade Angelo Rocchia watched with pride the woman advancing through the restaurant , noting approvinglyeach head that turned for a second glimpse at the lithe movements of her figure . Men always had a second look at Grace Knowland . Her fluffy black hair was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheekbones , her dark eyes and her pert mouth . She was not quite medium height , but she was so well proportioned , so finely muscled , that her clothes , like the simple white blouse and beige skirt she was wearing tonight , always seemed molded to her body . Above all , Grace radiated a fresh , engaging vitality that belied the fact that she was thirty-five , the mother of a fourteen-year-old boy , and had led a life not noteworthyfor its placidity . " Hi , darling , " she said , brushing his forehead with a quick , moist kiss . " Not late , am I ? " She slid onto the red velvet seat beside him , right under his favorite oil of the Bay of Naples and Vesuvius . Forlini 's was , as Angelo liked to say , " the kind of place where things transpire . " A few blocks away from City Hall , it had been for years a favorite hangout of top cops , judges , politicians , men from the DA 's office and minor Mafiosi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Black Label on the rocks to her . Angelo Rocchia drank very little , but he was fastidious about what he drank : " sipping scotch " and good wines , preferably the little-known Chianti classicos of Tuscany . " Cheers . " " Cheers . I hope it was n't too difficult . " Angelo lowered his glass and gave a slight move to his shoulders . " Each time , it 's the same thing . You think it ca n't possibly hurt any more and it always does . " Grace gently folded her hand over his . She had a pianist 's fingers , long , slender and strong , her almond-shaped nails trimmed short . " What 's hard is making yourself understand there 's no hope . " Grace saw a flicker of despair cross his face . " Let 's order . " Shesmiled . " I 'm famished . " Her gaiety was a forced effort to ease Angelo from the depression that inevitably gripped him on Sunday evenings . " Evening , Inspector . Try the linguine . Terrific . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table was Salvatore " Twenty Percent Sal " Danatello , his corpulent figure bursting out of a pale-blue double-knit at least three sizes too small for him . The detective looked at him , a sneer of contempt easing over his face . " How 's the family , Sal ? Keeping your nose clean ? " The change in Angelo 's tone , the abrupt switch from the soft , intimate half-growl he used with her to this inquisitor 's voice , its timbre as cold , as cutting as a knife 's blade , always disturbed Grace . " Sure thing , Inspector . You know me . Running a legitimate business . Payin ' my tax . " " Terrific , Sally . You 're just the kind of decent , upright citizen this city needs . " Sally hesitated a moment , hoping for the introduction Angelo had no intention whatsoever of making , then shuffled off . " Who 's that ? " Grace asked . " A wise guy . " Grace understood the jargon of the New York Police Department . She watched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't his wife and kids you were asking about . What does he do ? " " Knows good lawyers . Been busted three times for loan sharkingand walked every time . " Angelo snapped a breadstick in half and jabbed one jagged end into the butter dish before him . A sly grin crossed his face . " Of course , The New York Times would say it was just another example of how we waste our resources prosecuting nonviolent crimes . " Grace pressed her finger to her lips like a schoolteacher trying to hush an unruly classroom . " Truce ? " It was a little sign between them , a convention they employed whenever the deeply held convictionsinspired by their different vocations , hers as a City Hall reporter for the Times , his as a detective , clashed . " Yeah , sure , " growled Angelo . " Truce . What the hell , The New York /ime. % is probably right anyway . Sally 's collectors got a special , nonviolent way they clean up his had debts . " Despite herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head . " They put your fingers in a car door . Then they close the door . " Angelo savored the horror sweeping her face just an instant . " It 's like the ad says . The man runs a full service bank . " She could n't help laughing . He was a born actor , this detective of hers , with his Roman emperor 's profile , and his wavy gray hair that always made her think of Vittorio de Sica ; hair she knew he had styled once a month to conceal the bald spot emerging at the back of his head . They had met two years ago in his Homicide Squad office at 1 Police Plaza when Grace was doing a major takeout on violent crime in the city . With his dark suit , his white-on-white tie and shirt , the way he rolled his rs like a tenor at the Met , he had seemed closer to her idea of what a Mafia don should look like than a detective . She had noted the old-fashioned black mourning button in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking peanuts from his pocket . To stop smoking , he had explained . For almost a year they had met for an occasional dinner every couple of weeks , nothing more binding between them then their deepening friendship . Then , one steaming night in August , it had happened . They 'd gone that evening to a little seafood restaurant in Sheepshead Bay . The bluefish were running and they had each ordered one broiled with sage and rosemary . For a long time they had lingered on the terrace , sipping espresso and the last of their Frascati in the fresh Atlantic breeze . Suddenly , there on the terrace , Grace had sensed a barely disguised yearning in the way Angelo 's eyes kept returning to the blouse she had partially unbuttonedin the warm night air . She 'd been through three affairs since they met , each begun in promise and ended in pain . Angelo was not a handsome man ; yet there was an undeniable appeal in his battered , craggy face . Above all , there was a solidity about him , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has survived many an autumn storm . Walking out the door , Grace reached for his hand . " Angelo , take me home with you , " she whispered . Now , beside her , Angelo gave a soft groan as he contemplated the menu . They were after him , every time he took his Department physical , to lose a little weight . " Watch the blood pressure , " they 'd say . Tomorrow , he thought , and ordered cannelloni , a bicte ( ( al iorentina , and a bottle of Castello Gabbiano Riserva 1975 . Grace gave him a disapproving glance , then asked for a veal piccataand a green salad . " Hey , " he mumbled , " I 'm the policeman , remember ? " As the waiter moved away , they lapsed into silence . Grace seemed suddenly distant , absorbed in some private world of her own . " What 's the matter ? " " I got some news yesterday . " " Good or bad ? " " Bad , I guess . I 'm pregnant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberate movement . " You sure ? " She slipped her hand over his . " I 'm sorry , darling . I was n't going to tell you . Not yet , anyway . Your question caught me while I was thinking about it . " She reached for her glass and took a measured sip . " It 's one of those things that should never happen anymore , I know . I was careless . You see , after I had Tommy I had some trouble . They told me it was very , very unlikely I 'd ever conceive again . " She giggled and the corners of her dark eyes crinkled with her laughter . " And until you came along , I never did . " " I guess I should take that as a compliment . " Angelo slid his heavy arm along the top of their seat so that his fingers rested lightly on her shoulders . " I 'm sorry . I suppose it 's my fault . I should have been watching out . I guess I 'm out of practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grace studied the detective an instant , an appraising coolness in her eyes , waiting for another word , another phrase . It did not come . She twisted and stretched her long fingers on the tablecloth . " It 's strange carrying a life inside you . I do n't think a man can ever understand just what that means to a woman . I 've spent the last thirteen years living with the idea it would never happen to me again . " She took another drink . Her eyes were downcast , her voice suddenly plaintive . " And now it has . " Angelo let his regard travel around the crowded restaurant a moment , taking in the heads leaning conspiratorily together , making , unmaking deals . As he did , he tried to puzzle out the mood of the woman beside him . " Grace , tell me something . You 're not thinking about keeping it , are you ? " c2 " Would that be so terrible ? " Angelo paled slightly . He took his drink , swallowed the last of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers . " You know , I never told you , Grace , about Catherine and me . She had troubles , too . We tried for years to have a baby . She kept miscarrying and miscarrying . We did n't know why . " He lowered his glass to the table . " We could n't figure out what God or nature or whatever the hell you want to call it was trying to tell us . Until Maria was born . " Angelo was a long way from their crowded Italian restaurant . " I 'll never forget going into the deliveryroom that morning . I was so proud , so happy . I wanted a boy , sure , but a child , that 's what mattered . And there she was , this little tiny thing all red and shriveled , the nurse holding her up there by the ankles . Those hands , those little , tiny hands , were moving , kind of picking at the air like , and she was crying . " He paused a moment . " And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , you know ? It was n't round . The nurse looked at me . They know right away . I 'm sorry , Mr. Rocchia , ' she said , your daughter 's mongoloid . ' " Angelo turned to Grace , the sorrow of that instant , of all the painful instants that followed it , on his face . " Believe me , Grace , I 'd die before I 'd hear those words again . " " I understand you , darling . " Her hand closed over his . But they have a test now . It 's called amniocentesis . They can tell if a child 's going to be a mongoloid before it 's born . " " How did you find that out ? " " I checked with my doctor . " Angelo made no effort to conceal his astonishment . " So you 've been thinking a lot about this ? " The waiter appeared with their dinner . They watched in awkwardsilence as he set their plates before them , then drifted off . " I suppose I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Grace picked at her veal . You see , I know it 's the last chance for me , Angelo . I 'm thirty-five . " " How about me ? " There was an edge of petulance in his voice . " Do you really think a man is anxious to become a father at my age ? " Grace laid down her fork and meticulously dabbed at her lips with her napkin . " What I 'm going to say sounds selfish , I know. 53And I guess it is . But if I decide to have the child , it will be because I want it . Because I want something to help me fill the years I see ahead . Because this is a last chance and you do n't let go of last chances in life easily . But I 'll promise you one thing , Angelo . If I do decide to keep it , it 'll be my responsibility . I wo n't burden you with the problems my decision causes . I wo n't lay any responsibilitiesyou do n't want on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you mean ? You 'd want to bring it up like that , by yourself ? Alone ? " " Yes , I think perhaps I would . " Again Grace rested her hand on his . " Let 's not talk about it anymore . Not now at least . " She smiled . " Guess what ? Our beloved Mayor 's giving a press conferenceat nine tomorrow to explain why he has n't been able to get the snow off the streets . Because of my piece in this morning 's paper . " Much farther up Manhattan , on Central Park South , Laila Dajani stepped out of the Hampshire House , shiny black satin disco pants flashing beneath her fur jacket . " Studio Fifty-four , " the doorman ordered her cabdriver . The driver looked at her appreciatively in his rearview mirror . " Hey , you must know people , lady . " " I have friends . " Laila smiled . Then , as they approached FiftyseventhStreet , she leaned forward . " You know , I 'm going to change my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Got friends there too ? " " Something like that . " Laila stared out the window to stop the conversation . When they reached Thirty-second and Park she paid the fare , smiled at the driver and began to stroll casually along the avenue . Her eyes remained fixed on the taillights of the cab , following them until they disappeared from sight . Then she quickly turned and hailed another cab . This time , she told the driver to take her where she really wanted to go . In Washington , D.C. , the FBI 's fortresslike headquartersat Tenth Street and Pennsylvania Avenue , seven blocks from54the White House , blazed with lights . On the sixth floor of that headquarters the Bureau maintained a nuclear-emergency desk manned twenty-four hours a day by a trio of specially trained agents . It had been there since 1974 when the FBI assigned nuclear extortion a priority so urgent it was reserved for only a handful of major incidents headed by the most dreaded occurrence of all , Presidential assassination . Fifty times in the years since , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threats . Most had been the work of cranks or demented ideologues , the " do n't touch the Alaskan tundra or we 'll put a bomb in Chicago " sort of thing . But a significant numberof those threats had seemed deadly serious . They had included threats to blow up bundles of radioactive waste in Spokane , Washington , and New York City ; warnings of nuclear bombs alleged to be hidden in Boston , Detroit , Washington , D.C. , and four other American cities , and in a Long Beach , California , oil refinery . Some had been accompanied by designs of nuclear devices that had also been deemed " nuclear capable " by the weapons analysts of Los Alamos . The Bureau 's response to those threats had , on occasion , included the deployment of hundreds of agents and techniciansto the threatened cities . Yet no word of their activities had ever reached the public . Within half an hour of receiving the first alert from the White House , two teams of agents were onto the problem , a Crisis AssessmentTeam whose task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a Crisis Management Team responsible for dealing with it if it was . The fact that the extortion message was in a foreign language had immensely complicated their job . The first rule in an extortion case is to look at the extortion note or telephonecall for clues . The Bureau employed a Georgetown Universitylinguistic psychiatrist whose computers had proven to be remarkably accurate in providing a thumbnail description of an extortioner based on the language he had used in his threat note or phone call . In this case , however , his talents had been useless . As soon as the first warning had come in , a team of agents had gone to the Carriage House Apartments , a four-story yellow stone apartment house at the junction of L and New Hampshire , abutting the building housing the Libyan Embassy . Two of its occupants had been relodged in the Washington Hilton , and listening devices trained on the embassy next door had been placed in the walls of55their apartments . The same thing had been done to the Libyan UN embassy in New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Libyan diplomats accredited to either the United States or the United Nations . That operation had provided its first fruit while the NSC was discussing the consequences of Agnew 's report . Two Libyan diplomats , the ambassador to the United Nations and the first secretaryof the Washington embassy , had been located . Both had vehemently denied that their nation could be involved in such an operation . At 2031 , just after Agnew had given his conclusive determination that the design was for a viable thermonuclear device , an " All Bureaus Alert " had been flashed out of the Bureau 's sixth-floor communications center . It ordered every FBI office in the United States and overseas to stand by for " emergency action demanding highest priority and allocation of all available manpower . " FBI liaison agents to Israel 's Mossad , France 's SDECE , Britain'sMi5 and West Germany 's Landswehr were ordered to go through files , pulling out descriptions and , where available , fingerprintrecords and photographs of every known Palestinian terrorist in the world . One floor above the communications center , Quentin Dewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the midst of organizing the mobilization of five thousand agents . Agents shoeing horses in Fargo , South Dakota , catching the last of the day 's sun on Malibu Beach , walking out of Denver 's Mile High Stadium , washing up the supper dishes in Bangor , Maine , were being ordered to leave immediately for New York , each order accompanied by a vital closing injunction : " Extreme , repeat , extremediscretion must be employed to conceal your movements from the public . " Dewing concentrated his efforts in three areas . The nation 's bureauswere ordered to locate and take under permanent surveillance every known or suspected Palestinian radical . In New York and in half a dozen cities on the Atlantic seaboard , FBI agents were in action in every ghetto , every high-crime area , " pulsing " informers , querying pimps , pushers , petty crooks , forgers , fences , hunting for anything on Arabs : Arabs looking for fake papers ; Arabs looking for guns : Arabs trying to borrow somebody'ssafe house : anything .. lust as long as it had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groundwork for a massive search for the device , if it existed , and those who might have brought it into the country . Twenty agents were already installed at the computers of the Immigration and Naturalization Service offices on I Street , methodically going through the I94 forms for every Arab who had entered the United States in the past six months . The U.S. address listed on each card was Telexed to the bureau concerned . The FBI intended to locate , within forty-eight hours , each of these visitors and clear them , one by one , of any suspected involvement in the threat . Other agents were going through the files of the Maritime Associationof the Port of New York looking for ships that had called at Tripoli , Benghazi , Latakia , Beirut , Basra or Aden in the past six months and subsequently dropped off cargo on the Atlantic seaboard . A similar operation was under way at the air freight terminal of every international airport beteen Maine and Washington , D.C.Finally , Dewing had ordered a check run on every American who held , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " clearance for access to the secret of the hydrogen bomb . It was typical of the thoroughness with which Dewing 's bureau worked that shortly after 8 P.M. Mountain Time an FBI car turned into 1822 Old Santa Fe Trail , a twisting highway leading northeast out of the capital of New Mexico along the route over which the wagon trains of the old Santa Fe Trail had once rolled . With its silver RFD mailbox , the yellow metallic newspaper tube with the words New Mexican on its side , the one-story adobe house at the end of the drive was a supremely average American home . There was nothing average about the Polish-American mathematicianwho lived inside . Stanley Ulham was the man whose brain had unlocked the secret of the hydrogen bomb . It was one of the supreme ironies in history that on the spring morning in 1951 when he had made his fateful discovery , Stanley Ulham was trying to demonstrate with mathematical certainty that it was impossible to make that bomb based on the premise that had underlain years of scientific effort . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alternative approach that just might work . He could- have wiped that terrible knowledge from his blackboardwith a swipe of his eraser , but he would not have been the scientist he was if he had . Chain-smoking Pall Malls , flailing feverishlyat his blackboard with stubs of chalk , he laid bare the secret of the H bomb in one frantic hour of thought . The FBI agent did not require even that much time to clear the rather of the H bomb of any possible complicity in the threat to New York . Standing in his doorway , watching the agent drive away , Ulham could n't help remembering the words he had uttered to his wife on that fateful morning when he had made his discovery : " This will change the world . " A gray veil of cigarette smoke hung over the National Security Council conference room despite the continuous functioningof the building 's intensive air-circulation system . It was a few minutes past ten ; not quite two hours remained before the ultimatumperiod contained in the threat message was due to begin . Paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandwiches and black-bean soup the President had ordered the White House kitchen to send in to the conferees were scattered along the table and by the base of the room 's paneled walls . At the far end of the room , three Air Force colonels finished assembling a group of charts and maps . The senior officer , a youthful-lookingcolonel with a tapestry of freckles covering his face , stepped forward . " Mr. President , gentlemen , we 've been asked how Qaddafi or a terrorist group could transmit a radio signal from Tripoli to New York to detonate the device on the blueprint we 've been shown , and what technological resources we possess to prevent such a signal from coming in . " Basically , there are three ways you can detonate this . The first is a kamikaze volunteer who baby-sits the bomb with orders to set it off at a certain time if he does n't get a counterorder . " " Colonel , " Bennington interjected , " if this threat is really from Qaddafi , that is very much the last method he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . " " Right , sir , " the colonel replied . " In that case , there are two ways to do it , by telephone or radio . " The room was still , all eyes fixed on the speaker . " To attach the power pack you 'd require for this to the ordinary telephone is a very simple matter . Just a question of opening the telephone and connecting a couple of wires . That way the pulse of an incoming call is routed into a preprogrammedsignature detector . The pulse opens a circuit into a microprocessorin which a preprogrammed code has been stored . Themicroprocessor automatically compares it with the code , and if the two match it releases a five-volt charge of electricity into the bomb . " The beauty of this is a wrong number ca n't set it off by mistake ; and all a man has to do to explode the bomb is call that number from anywhere in the world and feed it his signal . " " It 's as easy as that ? " the President , jarred , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . " Can New York be isolated , absolutely sealed off from all incomingtelephone calls ? " the President asked . " No , sir , " the Colonel replied . " I 'm afraid that 's a technological impossibility . " He turned authoritatively back to his briefing charts . It is our judgment , however , that in a situation such as the one we 've been given , Qaddafi or a terrorist group would choose radio to detonate the device . It would offer more flexibility and is completely independent of existing communications systems . For a transmission over this distance , he 'd have to use long waves which bounce off the ionosphere and come back down to earth . That means low frequencies . " " How many frequencies would be available to him for something like this ? " the President asked . " From Tripoli to New York , a megahertz . One million cycles . " " One million ! " The President rubbed the stub of his chin between his thumb and forefinger . " Could we jam all one million of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd wipe out all our own communications . We 'd close down the police , the FBI , the military , the fire departments , everything we 'd need in an emergency . " " Never mind . Suppose I gave the order , could we do it ? " " No , sir . " " Why ? " " We simply do n't have the transmitter capacity . " " How about all our jamming devices in Europe ? " " They 're useless in this case . Too far away . " " He 's going to need something to receive this radio signal in New York , " Bennington remarked . " Some kind of directional an-tenna . " " Yes , sir . the easiest thing would be to put one in a standard television antenna on a rooftop and connect it to a pre-amplifier. 59Then the signal could be picked up and transmitted to his bomb wherever it is in the building over the television antenna cable . " " Surely you could put a fleet of helicopters over Manhattan and scan the frequencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then pick it up by direction finders , triangulation ? " " Yes , sir , we have the capacity to do that . But it would work only if his system is programmed to respond . If it 's only programmedto receive , we 'd get no reply . " " Well , there 's another way to do it if it turns out to be from Qaddafi , " Bennington said . His pipe was out and everyone in the room had to hang attendant on his words while he struck a match . " Explode half a dozen nukes in the atmosphere over Libya . That 'll set up an electromagnetic blanket that will smother any radio communicationsout of there for at least two hours . Shut them down completely . " " Mr. President . " It was Eastman . " For my part I do n't believe this threat is really from Qaddafi ; but in the unlikely event that it is , we 're going to have to make some assumptions , and the first one I would make is that he 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have a fail-safe system like a ship hidden somewhere out there in the Atlantic "  --  he waved at the vast blue stain on the map behind the colonel  --  " from which he or someone else can always detonate the bomb if we lay a preventive strike on Libya . " The President nodded in agreement and looked back at the briefingofficer . " The basic question to which we need an answer , Colonel , is this : Do we or do we not have any technological devices , systems or whatever which can guarantee that we can prevent a radio signal from being beamed into New York to detonate this thing if , in fact , it actually exists and it 's really in New York ? " The colonel tensed nervously at his question . " No , sir , " he replied . " I 'm afraid that given the present state of the art , trying to intercept or stop an incoming signal like this is scientifically impossible . It 's like trying to catch the right snowflake in the middle of a blizzard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the telephone at Eastman 's elbow flashed . It was the Army Signal Corps warrant officer in charge of the White House switchboard . Eastman stiffened listening to him . " Mr. President .. , he announced , . ' the switchboard 's just received a telephone message from an anonymous caller . He hung up before they could trace the call . He said there was a message for you of the utmost importance in locker K6o2 in the luggage containers next to the Eastern Airlines shuttle terminal at National Airport . " One fly-specked light bulb dangling from an overhead cord lit the garage . Its pale cone of light left pools of untouched shadow clinging to the garage 's walls and corners . At the back of the garage , a six-foot-wide cement loading dock rose above the black curds of oil and grease staining the floor . The dock 's back wall was a thin partition separating the garage from the abandoned warehousing area to the rear . Through it , a faint scraping sound drifted into the garage . Laila Dajani shuddered listening to it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her brother Kamal sat on a cot set up at the end of the platform , near a forklift truck . The passenger of the Dionysos twisted an air pistol in one hand . To his right , against the wall , were his latest victims , a pair of dead rats . Laila 's second brother , the eldest of the trio , had just entered the garage . Whalid Dajani was in agony . His face was pale ; specks of sweat sparkled at his temples . " Why do n't you take another pill ? " Laila demanded , her tone almost peevish . " I 've already taken five . That 's all I 'm supposed to take . " He showed his sister the package of Tagamet pills she had gotten for him to ease the pain of the ulcer for which he 'd earlier gulped his glass of milk on Broadway . " It says so on here . " His eyes turned away to the far end of the platform . It was there , just inside the shadows , a long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface of the water . It was painted black . Stenciled in white around the barrel 's waist were the name and address of the import-exportfirm to which it had been destined . Cords kept it firmly lashed to the pallet on which it had arrived . He dabbed at his damp brow . Do n't think , they had told him . Do n't think.of anything but your mission . But how did you not think ? How did you force from your mind what you 'd seen : the faces , the seas and seas of faces , old faces , young faces , faces of misery and indifference , faces of laughter and happiness ? Thefitfaces of little girls on their sleds in Central Park , of the black policeman telling him where to get off the subway ; of the newsstandvendor , half snarling , half laughing " Good morning , " selling him his paper . How could he not see the crowds , the buildings , the rushing cars , the lights that represented so many lives ? Behind him , Whalid heard the cot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirsty , " he mumbled . " Anyone want a Coke ? " Dazed , Whalid shook his head . Kamal stepped to a carton by the wall and pulled out a bottle of Chivas Regal whiskey . " Maybe this is the medicine you need . " " God , no . " Whalid grimaced . " Not while my ulcer 's bothering me like this . " Laila stirred impatiently . " How much time do we have left ? " " Enough , " Kamal answered . He picked a piece of cold pizza from a flat cardboard box by his cot . As he did , his sister noticed the name and address of the restaurant where he 'd bought it printed on the carton . " Are you sure no one 's going to be able to identify you in those places ? " she asked . Kamal gave her an angry glance . The constant boss . " Let 's set up our firing circuits , " he said . " Why ? " Whalid protested . " We still have plenty of time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . " Whalid sighed and walked over to a gray metal case the size of a large attache case resting on the floor beside his bomb . Nothing could have looked more innocent , more benign , than that case . Decals from TWA , Lufthansa , half a dozen of Europe 's best hotels were stuck to it . Indeed , the Customs officer at JFK had stopped Whalid as he was entering the country with it on Thursday bearing a Lebanese passport identifying him as Ibrahim Abboud , an electricalengineer . " It 's a microprocessor tester , " Whalid had explained , " to check to see if computers are working properly . " " Ah , " the Customs officer had remarked admiringly , closing the case that was designed to help destroy his city , " complicated , is n't it ? " Just how complicated he could not have imagined . The case had indeed been adapted from a microprocessor tester , a U.S.-made Testline Adit i 000 . One blazing summer 's day in July , the technical director of the Libyan telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resident director of Nippon Electric , the Japanese firm which had installed Libya 's telephones . What he wanted , he had explained , was an adaptation of the device which would offer a means of remote radio control of an electrical discharge , a system that would be both infallible and absolutely inviolable . Six weeks later , Kamaguchi had presented the Libyans the case now on the garage floor and a bill for $165,000 . Only the genius of the Japanese for miniaturization could have produced the array of fail-safe devices built into the case to frustrate any attempt to tamperwith its functioning . It was equipped with a magnetic-field detectorthat would order it to detonate instantly if it picked up any indication of an attempt to burn out its electronic circuitry with a magnetic field . There were static filters to counter any efforts to jam its radio receiver . Three tiny tubes sensitive to pressure changes protected it against the danger of gunfire or an explosion . Once it was hooked up , the pressure change caused by a New York telephone book falling toward the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother watched intently , Whalid opened its triple locking system and folded back the case cover to reveal a pale-blue control panel . On it was a cathode-tube screen , a keyboard and five keys bearing specific commands : END , AUTO , INIT , DATA , TEST . There was also a locked cassette player . Fixed into it was a thirty-minute BASF tape , a small red crescent in its upper-righthandcorner . Programmed in Tripoli , it contained instructions for the case 's minicomputer . Two connecting cords were neatly coiled inside the cover . One was designed to be hooked up to Whalid 's bomb , the other to the cable running up to the antenna Kamal had installed on the roof . Each was equipped with a " dead man control . " If any effort was made to disengage them once they had been hooked up they would automatically activate the firing system . Hidden below the panel 's blue surface was a radio receiver , a microprocessor , the minicomputerand a brace of powerful , long-lasting lithium batteries . As the two brothers watched , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The words " STAND BY " formed on the screen . Whalid glanced at them , then punched the key marked INIT . The word " IDENTIFICATION " appeared on the screen . Carefully , Whalid punched the code oIC2 onto the keyboard. 63The word " CORRECT " appeared on the screen . Had his code been wrong , " INCORRECT " would have appeared there and Whalid would have had exactly thirty seconds to correct his mistake or the case would have autodestructed . On the screen , the words " STORAGE DATA " appeared . Whalid looked at the checklist in his sister 's hands , then punched F19A onto his keyboard . Through the tape player 's window he could see the BASF cassette begin to spin . It turned for just under a minute , transmitting its program to the minicomputer 's memory bank . The tape stopped and the words " STORAGE DATA : OK " arose on the screen . Whalid methodically punched three successive code numbers onto the keyboard , following each by tapping the key TEST . There was a pause after each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " COMPUTER CONTROL : OK " ; " MICRO-PROCESSOR : OK " ; " RADIO FREQUENCY SIMULATION : OK . " " All right , " Whalid said , " everything 's working properly . Now we 'll test the manual firing system . " Fundamentally , the case had been designed to fire the bomb in response to a radio signal . It contained , however , a manually operatedbackup firing capability which any one of the three could operate if something went wrong . Whalid carefully formed the number 0636 on the keyboard . Those numbers had been chosen for their firing code because none of the Dajanis would ever forget them . They represented the date of the Battle of Yarmuk when the Arab warriors of Omar , the successor to the Prophet , defeated the Byzantines by the Sea of Galilee and established Arab domain over their lost homeland . As Whalid 's finger tapped the second " 6 , " the green light on the screen blinked off . For two seconds , it was replaced by a bright-red glow . " It works . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to . " He glanced at his watch , then up at the ceiling . " We 've got seventeen minutes to go . " In Washington , D.C. 's , National Airport , a tight police cordon screened off several dozen late-evening travelers stretching and straining to follow the progress of the FBI 's capital Bomb Squad . Cautiously , the agents scanned the hank of gray metal luggagelockers with Geiger counters , looking for radioactivity . They ( 'p4found none . Then three German shepherds trained to detect the scent of high explosives were led along the locker ranks . Finally , a pair of agents employing a touch as delicate , as precise as that of Japanese women assembling the circuitry of a computer chip unscrewedthe door to locker K6o2 and gently eased it from its hinges . To their relief , the only thing the agents found in the locker was an envelope leaning against the back of the compartment . Typed on it were the words " For the President of the United States . " The message it contained was brief . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , at a spot 153 miles due east of the junction of the twenty-fifth parallel and the tenth longitude , at the southern tip of the Awbari Sand Sea in the southwestern corner of Libya , Muammar al-Qaddafi would provide the United States with a conclusive demonstration of his ability to carry out the threat enunciated in his earlier communication . To facilitate aerial observation of the demonstration , the Libyan dictator proposed a carefully defined air corridor running south to the site from the Mediterranean Sea through which U.S. observation planes would be allowed to fly unmolested . There was not a sound except for the dry rustle of the rats in the darkened warehouse . The three Dajanis squatted on the cold cement loading dock , waiting . Whalid held his watch in his hand , mesmerized by the sweep of its second hand . Again , he turned his regard upwards . Somewhere up there in the infinity of space , a tiny ball of metal tumbled through the canopy of night . It was a forgotten satellite , its existence known only to a handful of amateur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the Libyan state . Softly Whalid began to count off the passing seconds : " Three . . . two . . . one . . . zero . " The sound of the last syllable had n't faded when it happeved : the green light glowing on the screen of their control case blinked off . In a split second , another color replaced it in almost instantaneousresponse to the gesture of a man burning with hatred and fanaticism halfway around the world . It was the same ominous red glow that had appeared there a quarter of an hour ago . Laila gasped . Whalid slumped forward , half relieved , half horror-stricken . Kamal looked on in silence . The red glow faded andthe words " RADIO FREQUENCY GLOBAL CONTROL : OK " appeared on the screen . Then they too faded and were replaced by the word " CONNECTION . " It was as though now that all their tests had been successfully run , the blue case before them was taking over , eliminatingfrom the carefully elaborated chain of command any further need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted the cable running from his bomb to the olive-drab circular plug an inch in diameter that connected it to the case . The next time the light on the screen glowed red , a flash of electricity from the case 's lithium batteries would pour through those pins to detonate the thermonuclear device lying on the platform . Whalid stared at that black object he had created . Oh God , oh God , he thought , why did you ever give men such power ? " What 's the matter ? " his brother asked . Whalid started like a child in a classroom caught daydreaming by a teacher . His watch was still in his hand . " The red light did n't glow a full two seconds , " he replied . " Are you sure you connected the rod up on the roof to the cable tightly ? " " Of course . " " I think we better check it . " Whalid took the pencil flashlight . " I 'll go up with you and hold this while you check it . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to it , Whalid doubled up in agony from the pain of his ulcer . " I ca n't go , " he whispered , handing the flashlight to Laila . " You go and hold it for him . " By the time Laila and Kamal returned , his spasm had passed . He was sitting on the dock , anguish no longer contorting his face . " It 's all right , " Kamal said . Whalid reached over and punched a final tap onto his keyboard , striking the word " END . " The control case was now locked . Only a code known to the three Dajanis could open it again . " Whalid , " Kamal said , " you better spend the night here in case they 're looking for you . How about you , Laila ? " " Do n't worry about me , Kamal , " she replied . " No one will look for me where I 'm going . " Shortly after eleven-thirty , the President , riding in the front seat of an unmarked Secret Service car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The members of the Crisis Committee , moving at irregular intervals to avoid drawing attention , had precededhim . An MP saluted the Chief Executive and led him to a plain white door under an archway bearing the words " JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF . " Its only identification was a set of figures , 2B89o . A pair of guards , armed with sidearms , verify both visually and electronically the identity of each visitor , even that of the President of the United States , passing through that door . In addition , a closed-circuit television system records on videotape the face of everyone who enters , the hour and the day he came in , and his reason for being there . There is good reason for that rigid security . Beyond that door lies an Ali Baba 's cave of the electronic age , the most mindbogglingdisplay of technological wizardry of which twentiethcenturyman is capable , the National Military Command Center of the United States . Seated in a leather armchair at the oval conference table dominatingRoom 2B89o , the President can , quite literally , watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States possesses , every electronic-surveillance network , all the vast electronicgadgetry at the disposition of the CIA , the National Security Agency , the Defense Intelligence Agency , all ultimately funnel into that immaculately white room not much larger than a small movie theater . The network of KH-I I satellites girdling the globe can flash onto any one of its six movie-sized screens a live television picture of any quarter of the planet . So fine is the resolution those satellite cameras provide from ninety miles into space that the President , sitting in his armchair , can tell the difference between a Jersey and a Guernsey cow in a pasture in Nottingham , England , or note the color and make of an automobile leaving the gates of the Kremlin . He can talk to a Marine Corps lieutenant leading a platoon on a patrol in Korea or eavesdrop on , and have instantly translated , a conversation between an airborne Russian MIG-23 fighter pilot and his air controller in Sebastapol . He could listen , thanks to the CIA , to the sound of men 's footsteps walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhear their most intimate conversations , the clink of their vodka glasses , or count the clicks on their telephones as they dial a number . And , from that leather armchair , the President could be both a67spectator and a participant in the ultimate tragedy . He could order a Minuteman missile launched from its site in South Dakota , then , like a spectator in a movie house , watch on one of the screens before him as the thermonuclear horror he had wrought devastated the people , the streets , the tenements of some Soviet city . Still wearing his blue jeans and his old cardigan , the President settled into that armchair and indicated he was ready to begin . On the wall opposite him , enclosed in a huge black frame to give contrast to the pictures they held , were six large screens used for displays . The rear admiral in charge of the center , one of the five flag officers in command of the shifts that manned it twenty-four hours a day , seven days a week , moved behind his console . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost bewildering speed , a portrait of the military forces of the Soviet Union as they were deployed at that very moment : nuclear submarines , every one at sea pinpointed by a blinking red light on a world map ; missile sites caught in a resolution so fine the men in the conference room could watch their Soviet sentries pacing their beats ; Backfire bombers on the Black Sea Coast ; SS-2o missiles along the Oder . The Admiral plunged the screens into darkness with a button . There was nothing , he said , in the Soviet 's military posture to indicate that the Soviet 's armed forces were in an alert status beyondtheir normal readiness state . It was unlikely that the Soviets were involved in what was happening in Libya . He turned back to his console and flicked a series of controls . Now a stretch of desolate sands reddening in the first light of morningappeared on the screen . At its center , barely visible , was a tower . " There , Mr. President , is the location we were given on the note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen lit up . On this one was a detailed resolution of the tower on the first . It was a spindly metal assembly resembling an old-fashioned oil-drilling rig , and at its top the men in the conferenceroom could make out the outlines of a large cylindrical object looking like a barrel and resembling very closely the description of the device on the blueprint given to them by Harold Agnew three and a half hours earlier . The Admiral turned again to his console . There had been , he noted , no satellites in position over Libya at the time the threatr , hhad been delivered to the White House . The precious satellites , whose orbits were set once each month by the NSC , were for the most part employed over the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe . Since the first alert , however , three KH-r i s had been shifted into fixed orbits over Libya , and the images delivered by a second satellite rose on one of the six screens . It was a cluster of buildings , the barracks compound of Bab Azizza to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Watching the screen , the men around the President could see the paratroopers who had turned the charge away stomping their feet in the morning chill . The image moved as it was adjusted and stopped again , this time on a series of small buildings . A white circle popped up around one of them , indistinguishable from the others , a roof inside a little walled compound . " Sir , " the Admiral said , " we believe this to be Qaddafi 's residence . We 've had it under surveillance since shortly after Los Alamos ' first alert . We 've seen no evidence of any activity whatsoeveror any sign that the building 's even occupied . " " What makes you think that 's Qaddafi 's residence ? " The Admiral adjusted the focus of the satellite picture so that the walled compound enclosed in the white circle filled the screen . Clearly visible , in the compound yard , was a black tent and , apparentlytethered to it , a camel . " Sir , Intelligence informs us Qaddafi keeps a tent and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk for breakfast . This is the only residence at Bab Azizza that meets that description . " The Admiral turned back to his display and called up a map of Libya 's Mediterranean Sea coast . On it , in the Gulf of Sidra , midwaybetween Tripoli and Benghazi , was a spot of white light . Northwest of the light , not far from the island of Malta , was a blinking red light . The blinking red light , the Admiral explained , was the U.S.S. Allen , an electronic-surveillance ship . It was crammed with sophisticatedlistening devices , like those with which the CIA had peered into the heart of the Soviet Union for years from its listening posts in Iran . The white light indicated the listening station to which the Allen was steaming at twenty-seven knots . Once there , she would he able to eavesdrop on every radio communication made in Libya and all of the telephone calls carried by her modern microwave communications system . Virtually every phone call made in Libya , 69from a man ordering a radio for his Toyota to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call made by Qaddafi himself on anythingother than a buried , secure line would be intercepted , copied and stored on shipboard computers . NSA headquarters outside Washington had already sent to the Allen voice samples of Qaddafi and five key Libyan leaders . Every intercepted call would be run past those samples by the computer so that calls made by any of the six men could be culled instantly from the hundreds of thousands of other calls being made across the country . The Mediterranean coast disappeared , to be replaced by a map of Libya . Down its western edge ran two closely parallel red lines , the air corridor laid down by Qaddafi in his message . Two thirds of the way down the corridor a naked eye could follow the progress of a flashing red light . " Sir , we ordered a Blackbird out of Adana to provide us secondaryobservation as soon as we received word , " commented the Admiral . A Blackbird was an SR-71 , a vastly improved version of the old U-2 spy plane , this one capable of flying over two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and radiation sensors developed to monitor in minute detail China 's and France 's nuclear tests . The President turned his attention back to the site identified in the National Airport note . Underneath the tower , in the quickening sunlight , the crisscross tracings of dozens of tire tracks were now clearly visible . " Harold , " the President asked his Defense Secretary , " what do you make of it ? " " It looks a lot like the pictures I 've seen of the old Trinity test site . " " Trinity " was the code name for the test of the first atomic bomb in the New Mexico desert in July 1945 . " Simple . Primitive . But efficient . " Brown looked at the screen like a professor studying a student 's design , hunting for its flaws . " Somewhere around there we should he picking up some sign of the command post he 'd use to set this thing off . " " We 've swept the area for it , sir , " the Admiral answered . " Unfortunately , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course you have n't . " The voice was Crandell 's , a rasp almost as harsh on the ears as the sound of gravel spilling down a7ometal chute . " Because there is n't any . That Arab son of a bitch is jerking us off , that 's what he 's doing . Two million people . That 's all he 's got in his country , two million people . They 're so goddamnedbackward , most of ' em , they ca n't even drive a car withoutstripping the gears . Know what a Frenchman told me once ? He caught one of their pilots looking into the gas tank of one of those Mirage planes they sold ' em to see if there was any gas left  --  with a match ! " Crandell roared with laughter , savoring the image of the ignorant Arab blowing himself and his aircraft to pieces in his search for gasoline . " And you really believe those people could do something like this ? " The President ignored him . " Harold , " he said , " he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if this works , is n't he ? " " Not necessarily . That 's about as remote a part of the world as you can find down there . Only a few Bedouin tribes running around . Nearest town 's well over a hundred and fifty miles away . They 'll see a hell of a flash of light all right , but not much else . " " What about fallout ? " The Admiral overheard the President . On one of the screens , superimposed over a map of northeast Africa , there appeared a sausage-shaped arc thrusting across southern Libya , northern Chad , the Sudan and into the southern corner of Saudi Arabia . " Sir , this is the fallout pattern we 're predicting based on the strength and direction of the upper air winds over the site . " " No radiation monitoring devices there , " Brown noted . " They 'll be reading a four or a five on their Richter scales in Europe . Probably put it down to an earthquake if it goes off . " It was four minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait . On the clocks suspended on one wall of the room , the white numbers silently clicked off each passing sound . The President 's eyes concentrated not on the test site but on the screen on which Qaddafi 's bungalow lay trapped in its circle of white . The details of the house and garden were clearly visible , the reddish tiles on the roof , the purplish splash of flowers beside the house . In the garden there was what looked like a child 's playground . Is it really possible , he asked himself , that a man living in a pleasant little house like that , a man with children , a man who believes in his God as devoutly as I believe in mine , could propose71something as mad , as senseless , as this ? What is there , he wondered , what hatred , what lust for power , what drive for revenge for a wrong that did n't even affect him or his own people directly , that could drive him to so irrational an act ? He shuddered . Harold Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , in a voice so soft only the Chief Executive beside him could hear it , " either we have a terrible problem on our hands or the cruelist hoax anyone 's ever played on a U.S. government . " The President nodded . He said nothing . He continued to gaze straight ahead , concentrating totally on the screens before him . The numbers rolled away toward the last zero , droplets falling rhythmically to an instant past . There was no sound in the room except the whir of the ventilation system . Even the lieutenant colonelsmanning the consoles , as used to tension as runners are to cramps , were pale with the strain . Eleven fifty-nine . Four precisely aligned zeroes appeared on the clocks ' panels . No one saw them . Every eye was on the screen along the room 's far wall , on the emptiness of the desert , on the frail tower planted on its sands like a withered tree trunk that had somehow survived there despite the ravages of time and nature . Five seconds , ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first creak of twisting armchairs indicated that the tension pent up in the room was easing . Forty-five seconds . Nothing , not even the eddying currents of a passing gust of wind , moved on the screen . One minute . Men at last sat back in their armchairs . A relief so intense it was almost a physical presence enveloped the room . " I told you the son of a bitch did n't have it . " Satisfaction seemed to mix with the sweat sparkling on Crandell 's face . Tap Bennington chewed on his pipe stem . " Mr. President , we 've now got to decide what our response to the threat should be . I think we should review immediately the range of military options we can address against Libya . " " Tap , just a minute , for God 's sake . " Warren Christopher of State was pleading . " We still have no confirmation whatsoever that Qaddafi is behind this . " You mean , " a furious Crandell demanded , " you propose to let that son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bomb  --  " Ile never finished . A white wall of light seemed to explode from72the screens of Room 2B89o . So blindingly luminous was its flash , so painfully intense its glare , the men in the room flinched and shielded their eyes . Then , from ninety miles into space and a quarterof the way around the planet , the satellite cameras sucked up the fireball soaring over the Awbari Sand Sea and sent it hurtling onto the screens of the Pentagon , a roiling caldron of exploding gases : whites , reds , yellows and oranges , arranged in a dazzling kaleidoscope of light and fire . For seconds , too stunned to react or speak , the two dozen men in the room stared , thanks to those cameras , at a sight no human eye had ever beheld , the bowels of hell , the incandescent heart of a thermonuclear explosion . The first sound to intrude on the room came from seventy thousand feet over the site , from the pilot of the SR-71 . Mechanically , indifferent to the spectacle below him , he read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tide of thermal X rays , gamma rays , beta particles rushing past his detectors . His figures meant nothing to most of the men in the room . It did not matter . Everything they needed to know was right there on the screen before them , in the unsurpassable beauty and horror of a fireball rising from the desert floor . The President squeezed Harold Brown 's forearm in his fingers . He had paled and his mouth hung half open , his lower lip curling downward with dismay . Watching , mesmerized , he could think of only one thing : John the Divine 's Revelation of the Apocalypse : " . . . behold a pale horse : and his name that sat on him was Death , and Hell followed with him . " Now , he thought , a Fifth Horseman has emerged from the entrailsof hell to scourge humanity with terror , with arms so terrible even John 's hallucinating imagination could not have conceived them . " My God , " he whispered to the man beside him . " Oh my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " 73PART II ... at last we shall make justiceprevail . " HE ANSWER TO AN ANGUISHED PRESIDENT 'S QUEStioncould be traced back to a November afternoon in Paris not quite one year before the Libyan 's threat message had been delivered to the White House gate . France 's President Valery Giscard d'Estaing , punctual as usual , entered the Cabinet Room of his Elysee Palace precisely at four o'clock that afternoon . He circled the table to greet first the Prime Minister , then the Ministers of Finance , Industry , Foreign Affairs , the Interior and Defense . When he got to Pierre Foucault , Chairmanof France 's Atomic Energy Commission , a broad smile broke out on his composed features . " Bravo , mon cher , " he said to his old friend and schoolmate . Foucault 's reply was a glance at the empty chair beside his . The scientist he had summoned to this restricted and secret meeting was late . A slight flaring of his nostrils betrayed Giscard 's irritation . We shall proceed as planned , " he said . He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that slow , precise enunciation he reserved for particularly solemn occasions , began . " Messieurs , " he declared , " I have asked you here today to inform you of an event that is certain to have an overwhelming impact on the destiny of our nation . A team of French scientists working at our laser fusion research center at Fontenay-aux-Roses has succeeded within the past week in solving one of the most formidable scientific challenges in man 's history . Indeed , they have done something scientists around the world have been trying to do for thirty years  --  produce energy from fusion . The results of their work will ultimately permit this country , and indeed the entire world , to resolve the most intransigent problem we all face , the global energy crisis . " He paused to allow the impact of his words to register . " We77have asked the man responsible for our success , Monsieur Alain Prevost , to join us , but he has apparently been held up in traffic , so I shall ask Monsieur Foucault to begin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up the carafe in front of him and filled his water glass . He took a sip . Then he held up the glass as though he were about to propose a toast . " Messieurs , " he began , " the meaning of our breakthrough is that the water in this glass . . . " he paused an instant for dramatic effect , swirling the water in his upraised glass , allowing it to glisten in the pale sunlight , " is now a source of energy capable of lighting the lamps of mankind . It means that there is now in this glass of water alone enough energy to meet the power requirements of the entire city of Paris and all its inhabitants for forty-eight hours . " Foucault brought the glass back to the ministerial table with a sharp crash . The men around him gasped . He paused , savoring the shock his words had produced . Then he began again , his voice softer . " Until now , man has met his energy needs by exploiting the heritage of the past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth 's crust . His long-term survival on this planet has depended , however , on finding a new source of energy , one that is by its very nature virtually inexhaustible . There are only two , the sun  --  and water . " With water , " he said , " we begin with the most abundant resourceon the planet . It is , after all , everywhere . All water contains one of the simplest atoms on earth  --  deuterium , or , as we say , heavy hydrogen . ' This water glass is full of them . If we can bang two of these atoms together hard enough so that they meld  --  that is , fuse  --  the result is a release of energy so enormous it staggers the mind . " Let me give you an example . One kilogram of the petroleum we now purchase at such an exorbitant cost in the Persian Gulf releases thirteen kilowatt hours of energy when it burns . One kilogramof heavy hydrogen , properly fused , will release . . . " again Foucault paused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kilowatt hours of energy . " The ministers let out what was nearly a collective gasp . " The search for this energy form , " he told his now spellbound audience , " goes hack to the 19305 when the  --  glish astrophysicistsat the Cavendish I.ahoratories realized that this was the pro-78cess which explained the unaccountable energy releases of the sun and the stars . If it could be done in the stars , they asked , why could n't it be done on earth ? " Foucault leaned forward , savoring for an instant the role of a pedagogue . " It meant , messieurs , dealing with time in billionths of seconds . A billionth of a second is to one second as one second is to three hundred and thirty-two years . It meant creating conditions of temperature and pressure that are equivalent to hell on earth . " The Soviets made the first great leap forward in 1958 with the ingenious use of magnetic force to produce the effect we sought . In the late sixties when the scientific community introduced the power of the laser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you all know , we here in France have been at the forefront of laser technology . Our stunning and quite unexpected breakthrough of a fortnight ago comes as a result of the scientific advances we made in the late seventies developing our new carbon-dioxide laser . " I must caution you all , " the Minister warned , " on the need for the utmost secrecy about our advance . What we have done is to demonstrate for the first time the scientific feasibility of the fusion process . Applying it commercially will require years and years of work . The potential commercial benefits to this country of our head start , however , are incalculable . We must not allow the prematuredisclosure of our discovery to deprive France of the just  --  and immeasurable  --  rewards of our scientists ' work . " So mesmerized were the men around the table , no one noticed a hussier slip into the council chamber and discreetly hand an envelopeto the Minister of the Interior . The Minister glanced at its contents , then , his face a register of the gravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valery Giscard d'Estaing . " Monsieur le President , " he said , interrupting Foucault 's speech , " the Brigade Criminelle of the Prefecture of Police has just informed me they have discovered a car with a corpse in it abandonedin the Allee de Longchamps in the Bois de Boulogne . The corpse has been tentatively identified through a laissez-passer issuedto attend this meeting . It appears to belong to this scientist we are waiting for  --  " he glanced at his paper  --  " Alain Prevost . " Three blue police vans , yellow roof lights blinking , marked the scene . A cordon of policemen screened off passersby , 79prostitutes and poodle walkers gawking in morbid curiosity at the Renault and the shrouded figure laid out on the ground beside it . Ignoring his policemen 's salutes , the Minister of the Interior , trailed by Pierre Foucault , swept through the cordon up to Maurice Lemuel , head of the Police Judiciaire , France 's top police investigatoryforce . " Alors ? " barked the Minister . Lemuel turned to a plastic sheet laid out on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a wallet and a slide rule , its white lacquer surface yellowed by age and use . " That 's all ? " the Minister asked . " No sign of the documents he was carrying ? " " That 's all , sir , " Lemuel replied . " That and the pass we identifiedhim with . " The Minister turned to the Atomic Energy Chairman . " It 's perfectlyincredible , " he said , his voice full of barely controlled anger . " You let these people go walking about Paris carrying secret papersas though they were taking shirts to the laundry . " " Olivier , " Foucault protested , " these men are scientists . They just do n't think about security the way you do . " " Maybe they do n't , " the Minister said . " But you 're supposed to . You 're personally responsible for the security of your agency . Which has been appallingly bad in this case . " He turned back to Lemuel . " What have you learned ? " " Very little , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sure of the cause of death . I would guess from the expression on his face that he was either smothered or had his windpipe brokenby a very forceful , expert karate blow . " Shortly after 4:30 A.M. the following day a telephone 's harsh summons jarred the stillness of the Minister of the Interior 's private apartment above the Place Beauvau . He groaned . From under the covers , his hand flayed uncertainly at the darkness , searching out the sound . His caller was the Atomic Energy Chairman . " They called , " Foucault gasped . The people who killed Prevost . They want a million francs for the attache case . They just got through to our director of research at Fontenay , Pierre Lebrun . They told him if we want it hack he has to he at the ( ' intro liar on the Vieux-Port inKoMarseilles at exactly twelve noon today with one million francs in hundred-franc notes in a plastic shopping bag of the Bazaar d ' Hotel de Ville . He 's supposed to wear a dark-blue suit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt hat . " Despite the seriousness of his caller 's words , the Minister could not help laughing . " Dressed like that , your poor Monsieur Lebrun is going to stand out like a nun in a whorehouse down there . " He rose from his bed , looking about for his clothes . " Have MonsieurLebrun at my office at eight o'clock , " he ordered . " I 'm going to convene a meeting of my top people immediately . " The four senior police officials of the French Republic sat respectfully in front of the Interior Minister 's desk , a gift from Napoleon to one of his distant predecessors . They were PaulRobertde Villeprieux , the director of the DST , France 's counterespionageservice ; his bald , slightly stoop-shouldered colleague General Henri Bertrand , head of what was familiarly known in the Ministry as La Piscine ( " The Pool " ) , the SDECE , France 's intelligenceservice ; Maurice Fraguier , the forty-five-year-old director general of the National Police ; and General Marcel Piqueton , commanderof the forty-thousand-man Gendarmerie Nationale . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Gentlemen , " he said , sipping at the black coffee he had orderedfor them all , " what are your views ? " Fraguier , chief of the Police Nationale , began . " Quite frankly , Monsieur le Ministre , I had suspected we were dealing with an affair of state here , a theft of industrial secrets by a foreign intelligenceservice , the CIA probably , or the KGB . This message makes it quite clear it 's a banal case of extortion organized by the Corsicanmilieu . This is characteristic of the way the Corsicans behave in payoff delivery situations . " Fraguier lit a cigarette and sat back in his chair . " It does n't require a great deal of imagination to predict how it 's going to work . Right near the Cintra Bar down there in Marseilles they 've got the biggest Corsican neighborhood in France , the Bread Basket . ' They 'll use it for the payoff , because they feel safe in there . " They 'll let Monsieur Lebrun sit and marinate for a while in the Cintra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not around . Then he 'll get a telephone call . He 'll be told to leave im-8tmediately for another address up in the Bread Basket by a very precise route . They 've picked l'heure du pastis , so they 'll probably send him to another bar and they 'll give him a pseudonym , Jean Dupont . Once he 's in the bar he 'll get another call with the instructionsas to where to leave the money . It will be very nearby , but out of sight of the bar . The trashcan in front of 1 ' 7 Rue Belles Ecuelles . Or they 'll say , Hang it on the handlebars of the blue bicycle leaning against the door of to Rue des Trois-Lucs . Do it immediately and come back to the bar . ' When they 've picked up the payoff , he 'll get a last call telling him where the papers are . " The Minister placed his hands before him as though in prayer , lightly tapping his fingertips together , contemplating the scenario his police chief had outlined . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed like a monk in meditation , a Gauloise cigarette that never seemed to move dangling from his mouth , General Henri Bertrand sat motionless on his spindly chair . The perfect stillness of the man was attested to by the inch-and-a-half-long ash dangling at the end of his cigarette . He spoke and it spilled over the lapels of his gray suit . " Since when have your Corsican friends been so interested in science ? " he asked Fraguier . " When the Russians wanted to get hold of our designs for the Concorde , what did they do ? " Fraguier replied . " They went down to Marseilles and knocked on the right Corsican 's door , did they not ? Perhaps that experience taught our Corsican friends the value of industrial secrets . " Bertrand brushed the ashes from his suit . " Their asking price seems low , " he suggested in his quiet voice . " Yes , " Fraguier agreed . " But remember , for them it 's a lot of money . They may not realize just how valuable those papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked the Minister , " that they have n't photostated those documents and wo n't try to hold us up again ? " " None whatsoever , " Fraguier answered . He paused . " But they wo n't . Corsicans are honorable people . They only cheat you once . " For a moment , the only sound in the office was the creaking of the Minister 's chair as he slowly rocked back and forth . In a sense , they had been fortunate . If they made the payoff , it would all he over . The incident would never get to the public and the secret of the scientific advance would he kept safe . " All right , do it , " he ordered his police chief . " I 'll arrange with the Treasury for the million francs . " A gray stain seeped along the edges of night . Dawn was about to break over the barren immensity of the desert . That period immediately preceding the emergence of the solar disc on the horizonwas known to the followers of the Prophet as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes , just the time required by the Faithful to recite the first of their five sourates , the daily prayers prescribed by the Koran . Dressed in a crude shepherd 's cloak of brown and white stripes , a flowing white kaffiyeh held in place by one cord on his head , a man in his late thirties emerged from his goatskin tent and spread a prayer rug on the sand . Turning east , he began to invoke the name of Allah , Master of the World , the All-Merciful and AllCompassionate , the Supreme Sovereign of the Last Judgment . He prostrated himself three times , touching his forehead to the earth each time , glorifying as he did the name of God and His Prophet . His prayer finished , Muammar al-Qaddafi , the undisputed ruler of the Libyan nation , sat back on his rug and watched the rising sun flame the desert sky . He was a son of the desert . He had entered the world in a goatskin tent similar to the one in which he had just passed the night . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought that evening between the gunners of Rommel 's Afrika Korps and Montgomery 's Eighth Army . He had spent his boyhood wandering the desert with his tribe , maturing to the searing gusts of the siroccos , the blessings of the winter rains , the quick flowering of the pastures . From the sand seas below Cyrenaica southwest to the palm trees of Fezzan , there was not a prickly bush , a sweep of grass or a dried-out riverbed that had escaped his predator 's gaze in the nomad 's quest for pasturage for his flock . Regularly , when he felt overwhelmed by the frustrations and disappointments of the power that was now his , he retreated back here to his desert to immerse himself again in the wellsprings of his being . Now , as he meditated on his prayer rug , his eye caught the gleam of a pair of headlights on the horizon . A white Peugeot 504 drew toward the small military encampment half a mile from his tent where his visitors were screened and the communications which tied him to Tripoli were installed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and meticulously scrutinized first its driver , then his papers . When they had finished they ordered the driver out of his car . They ran a metal detector over his body . Finally , satisfied , they allowed him to set out alone , on foot , toward the Libyan dictator . Qaddafi followed his progress across the sands . When he was a hundred yards away Qaddafi stood and walked out to meet him . " Salaam alaikum ! " he called out . " Alaikum salaam , " the visitor replied . Qaddafi advanced a few steps and embraced him on both cheeks . " Welcome , my brother , " he said . He drew back and looked at him , amused . Whalid Dajani was red-faced from the unaccustomed exertion of his half-mile walk in the desert . " I have . . . " he began in an excited gasp . Qaddafi raised his hand to interrupt him . " First , coffee , my friend , " he said . " Afterward , insh ' Allah , we will talk . " He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he picked up a brass coffee pot from the fire glowing in his brazier . He poured the pale Bedouin coffee into handleless porcelain cups shaped like oversized thimbles and offered the first one to his guest . They drank . Then Qaddafi lay back on the Oriental rugs thrown around the floor of his tent . The suspicion of a smile crossed his handsome face . " Now , my brother , " he said , " tell me your news . " " The package arrived , " the visitor replied , " last night . " He took a deep breath and held it trapped in his lungs as though trying to hold back with it the rush of words ready to spill from his mouth . Finally he exhaled a breath that reeked of the dozens of peppermint Lifesavers he had gulped to kill the odor of the Chivas Regal whiskeyhe had been sipping all night long . Alcohol was totally banned in Qaddafi 's domain . " I ca n't believe it yet , " he said . " It 's all there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head in disbelief . Once again he saw the columns of figures plunging toward an infinity of power such as few minds had ever been privileged to contemplate . His vision , however , was not that of the limitless reserves of energy that had enfevered the mind of the French scientist who had first looked at them barely a week before . What Dajani had glimpsed was a vision of hell , the dark underside of the dream of fusion . the terms of a Faustian compact Alain Prevost and others84pursuing his dream around the world had had to strike with the capricious gods of science . For , in opening to man the vista of unlimited energy for as long as he and his planet might endure , they had also exposed the keys to a force so destructive it could set a premature end to his , and his environment 's , existence . Frozeninto the endless rows of figures in the computer printout Prevosthad been taking to his meeting at the Elysee Palace was the secret of the hydrogen bomb . " Carlos and his people worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no way this can be traced back here ? Our relations with the French are vital . " Dajani shook his head . " They copied the papers right away . Then they called the French as though they were Corsican gangsterslooking for a ransom . " " And the French believed them ? " " Apparently . " Qaddafi rose from his carpet and moodily stirred the coals glowingin his brazier . " My brother , " he said , " when we started this operation you said the Frenchman was working on a new kind of energy . " His visitor nodded . " Why is it , " Qaddafi continued , " you were able to get the secret of the hydrogen bomb from what he was doing ? " " Essentially , " Dajani replied , " what they were trying to do in Paris was to make a mini-mini-hydrogen-bomb explosion . A controlledone so that they could use the energy it released . People have been trying to do that for thirty years , since the Americans exploded the first hydrogen bomb . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dramatic gestureplucked a single strand of hair from his balding head . He held it up before Qaddafi 's intrigued eyes . " What they were trying to do was to make a bubble no thicker than this hair explode . To do it , they had to squeeze it to one thousand times its normal density with a laser beam in a time so short the mind ca n't imagine it . " Qaddafi 's eyes widened . But why did the secret of the hydrogenbomb come out of that ? " " Because with all experiments like this , the evolution of every ingredient is being constantly recorded by computer . For one tiny , tiny instant just before that little bubble exploded , it took on the one perfect configuration of a hydrogen bomb . Its secret , the exact85relationship between its ingredients , is detailed here in the computerprintout . " Qaddafi rose and walked in silence to the entrance of the tent . He stood there scrutinizing the horizon , incarnadined now by the fast-rising sun . For an instant he forgot what the scientist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every dawn in the desert since he was a boy , he studied the sky for some precursor foretelling the arrival of the Bedouin 's timeless enemy , the guebli , the searing wind that rose in the desolate expanse of the Sahara . When the guebli blew , death rode its wings , and man and beast huddled together , as often he had with his father 's herd , seeking protection against the onrushing clouds of sand under which whole tribes had been known to vanish . This morning , though , the sky was a violent blue , not the silvery gray that heralded the guebli . He looked at it reassured , at the oneness of the vast canopy of sky and the endless horizons of his desert . The world stretching away from his tent was a cruel , harsh world ; but it was a simple one in which choices and their consequenceswere clear : You crossed the sands in search of the well . You found the well and you survived . You did not and you died . Perhaps now with what his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the one for which he had been searching for so many years . For a moment , standing there in the morning sunlight before reentering his tent , Qaddafi thought of the story his father had told him of the kettate , the tattooed fortuneteller , who had appeared at their campsite as his mother screamed in the pain that preceded his birth . She had gone to the tent in which the men of the tribe sipped tea waiting for the birth and shook out on a carpet the twenty-three rigidly prescribed oddments of her trade , an old coin , a shard of glass , a dried date kernel , a bone from a camel 's hoof . Then she proclaimed it would be a boy . He would be an anointed of God , she announced , a man destined to stand out from all the others , to perform God 's work in the service of his people . She had barely finished when the first part of her prophecy was confirmed . The scream of the midwife rang out from the woman 's tent calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Allah akhbar  --  God is great . " Qaddafi turned hack into the tent . From a copper pot he took a thick , creamy bowlful of leben , goat 's curd , and a black wad of dates , the Bedouin 's traditional breakfast . He set them on the carpetand bade his guest eat. uf . Dipping a date into his curds , Qaddafi pondered , as he often did , on the old woman 's prophecy and how favored indeed he was in Allah 's eyes . Allah had given him a mission , to bring His peoples back to God 's way , to reawaken the Arab people to their true destiny , to right the wrongs that had been done to his brothers . And He had given him the means to accomplish it , the oil without which those who had so long exploited his people could not survive . To get it from him , the others had had to offer him the means to his vision : wealth , the arms he had bought , the technology he had acquired , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his visitor had laid before him  --  the prospect of the ultimatepower on earth . " And , my brother , " he said to Dajani , " we can build this from these documents they brought you last night ? " " It 's a long , hard road with many , many problems . First we must finish our atomic program . There will be difficulties and risks  --  the danger the Israelis will find out what we are doing and destroyus before we can succeed . " Qaddafi looked out to the desert stretching away from the tent , a distant gaze in his dark , brooding eyes . " My friend , there has never been greatness without danger . There has never been a great victory without great risks . " He rose , indicating to Dajani that the conversation was over . " You have done well , my brother , " he said , his voice almost reverent , " ever since Allah sent you here to help us . Now , thanks to you , at last we shall make justice prevail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sands to his car . Gently he placed a hand on Whalid 's elbow . A faint , ironic smile crossed his features . " My brother , " he murmured , " perhaps you should not eat so many peppermints . Such things are bad for the good health God gave you . " The vista laid bare to Muammar al-Qaddafi in his desert retreat was only the last , terrifying consequence of an enterprise the Libyan had pursued from the moment , almost , that he had seized power . Power was something the Bedouin dictator understoodinstinctively , and what better way to assert his claim to the leadership of a resurgent Arab world than to be the first Arab leader to arm his nation with the ultimate weapon ? Qaddafi had taken his first step on the road to his desert rendez-u- , vous in 1969 , shortly after he had consolidated his revolution . He sent his Prime Minister , Abdul Salam Jalloud , to Peking with an offer to buy half a dozen atomic bombs from China 's nuclear arsenal . Rebuffed by the Chinese , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 600-megawatt nuclear reactor to desalinize sea water for irrigating his desert . Since no one in the world knew how to do that at anything remotely approaching an economically justifiable cost , the implication that Qaddafi had other uses in mind for the plant was clear . The State Department refused to authorize the sale despite the protests of Westinghouse and its congressional lobby . The Libyan then sought to buy an experimental reactor from Gulf General Atomic of San Diego . The reactor itself could not have been used to make an atomic bomb , but the fuel that Gulf General was ready to sell Qaddafi along with it  --  fully enriched uranium  --  was ideal bomb material . Henry Kissinger'spersonal intervention was required to block that initiative . Qaddafi ' s program got into high gear after the 1973 war and his realization that Israel possessed atomic weapons . He himself picked the program 's code name , Seif al Islam  --  ' The Sword of Islam "  --  and placed it under the direct control of Prime Minister Jalloud 's office . Three principles were to guide it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cover of a peaceful nuclear-energy program . Second , Libya would look primarily to Europe for its technology . Third , every effort would be made to staff the program with Arab scientists , men either recruited from universities and nuclear programs or trained at Libyan expense in the best universities in the world . By the midseventies , the CIA began picking up indications that Libya was trying to recruit European nuclear engineers by dangling large Swiss-banked sums of money in front of them . One indication of how far the program 's tentacles could reach was the dismissal of Dr. Klaus Traube , manager of Germany 's Interatom Company responsible for research on the fast breeder reactor . Traube was revealed to have had a close relationship with Hans Joachim Klein , a young Libyan-trained terrorist who participated along with " Carlos " in the Vienna kidnapping of the OPEC oil ministers in December1975 . It was , however , to the explosion of India 's atomic " device " in the Rajasthan desert on May 19 , 1974 , that the Libyan owed his access to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night that his countrymen would one day possess nuclearweapons to rival his neighbors ' even if they had " to eat grass " to get them . Given the impoverished state of Pakistan 's treasury , his might have been an idle boast had it not been for a secret deal Bhutto negotiated with Qaddafi . Its terms were simple : in return for Libya 's financing Pakistan 's purchase of a **27;8002;TOOLONG and several reactors from France , Qaddafi would receive some of the plutonium the Pakistanis intended to divert from the plant and access to their advanced nuclear technol-ogyThat arrangement ultimately collapsed when the French , under pressure from the United States , agreed to abandon the sale . In the meantime , Bhutto 's overthrow and subsequent execution had brought a brief chill to Libyan  --  Pakistani relations . The combination of Libyan financing and Pakistani technology was too promising , however , to be lost in a clash of personalities , and the original collaboration was renewed in General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq 's pursuit of the " Islamic Bomb . " While his cooperative effort with Pakistan continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely national program . In 1976 he persuaded Jacques Chirac , then France 's Prime Minister , to sell him the nuclear reactor for desalinizing sea water the Americanshad earlier refused him . President Giscard d'Estaing quietly let the project fade until , under the pressures on France 's balance of payments created by the 1979  --  80 oil price rises , he reluctantly authorized the reactor 's sale . The most dramatic confrontation in Qaddafi 's long pursuit of the atomic bomb , however , had for its setting a place as remote from the goatskin tents in which he enjoyed resting as could be imagined . It was an ornate salon in the Palace of the Czars , the Kremlin . Qaddafi 's interlocutor that December day in 1976 was not a Russianbut the proudest industrial baron of the nation that had once colonized Qaddafi 's people . Who could have better symbolized the unsettled and indulgent world whose way of life was menaced by the austere visionary emerging from his deserts than Gianni Agnelli : aristocrat , playboy , heir to a technological complex as sophisticated and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company . Agnelli was the supplicant that day . He had come to Moscow in secret because he needed something Qaddafi had to offer , money. 89Qaddafi already owned ten percent of his firm , purchased a few months before for $415 million , more than triple the market value of the shares . To an astonished Agnelli , he proposed to buy even more or release to him large investment sums if Agnelli could convertpart of his company , with Soviet help , into an advanced weaponsindustry , including a major branch devoted to nuclear research and development . It was a diabolical proposition . Agnelli was being asked to set an unstable nation just across the Mediterranean from his homeland on the road to weapons of mass destruction in return for the funds that might save his industrial giant from collapse . The Italian 's readiness to consider the proposition , however briefly , was one more confirmation of the premise underlying Qaddafi 's enterprise : that the day would come when , under the pressure of the energy crisis , there would be nothing in the West that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eucalyptus- and laurellinedhighway leading to the Libyan capital , sweating profusely , his mind still back in the desert , on the harrowing hours he 'd lived since they 'd brought him the transcript of Prevost 's phone call a week ago . He could feel in his stomach the ache of the ulcer his doctor had warned him he was developing . A man is dead because of me , he thought . A man like me , who had the ideals I once had . My God , he reflected , how far I 've come , how far away I am from what I set out to be . He saw ahead , not the highway into Tripoli , but the other terrible road on which he was embarked . " Since Allah sent you here to help us , " Qaddafi had said . Whalid smiled bitterly . Allah had had nothing to do with it . It had been his brother Kamal and it had all begun that morning in JanuaryI977 when Kamal had arrived in Paris . The debarking passengers of Austrian Airlines Flight 705 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Gaulle Airport and clustered around the passport-control desk of Gate 26 . Kamal Dajani was wearing a beige suede jacket and blue jeans , an Austrian Airlines carry-on hag hanging from his shoulder . A dark suntan , the product , presumably , of the ski slopes of the90Tyrol , burnished his lean face and emphasized the delicate blue of his eyes . He presented the passport officer at the desk an Austrian passportidentifying him as Fredi Mueller , an agricultural-machinery salesman from Linz , then strolled casually into the lobby and on to the nearest men 's room . He hesitated a moment before entering the last stall in line . He locked the door and set his airline bag on the floor . An instant later , a hand pulled it into the adjacent stall , then slid an absolutely identical bag back to his feet . Kamal opened it up and methodically checked its contents : a Walther P-38 automatic ; three magazines of 9mm. ammunition ; two U.S. Army fragmentation grenades ; a switchblade knife ; a red guide , Paris par Arrondissement , on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address he had committed to memory ; another set of identity papers , these French , identifying him as Mohammed Yaacef , an Algerian postgraduate student studying in France ; a small vial of liquid ; and , finally , five thousand French francs in assorted notes and coins . As he passed the toilet attendant on the way out , he sent a one-franc coin clattering into the saucer beside her . No need , he thought , to give her any reason to glare at him . Forty minutes later , he got out of a taxicab at the junction of the Boulevard St.-Michel and the Boulevard St.-Germain at the heart of Paris 's Latin Quarter . He crossed the Place du Luxembourg and strolled along the iron fence of the Luxembourg Gardens down to the Rue d'Assas . There he turned left until he reached number 89 at the corner of the Rue Tavard opposite the Tarnier Maternity Clinic . The building 's ground floor was occupied by a bakery , and as Kamal climbed to the first floor he savored the odor of warm bread and fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocked at the first door on the left . Inside , he heard the thump of bare feet on wood , then felt someone staring at him through the door 's peephole . " It 's me , " he whispered in Arabic , " Kamal . " His sister Laila opened the door . For an instant brother and sister looked at each other . Then , with half-stifled cries , they fell into each other 's arms . " Five years , " Laila whispered . " Why so long ? " 91 " I had no choice , " Kamal replied . She beckoned him inside . Before closing the door , she glanced down the stairwell , making sure he had not been followed . Then she fixed the door with a double lock . " Show me what they did to you , " Laila demanded as soon as they reached the sitting room . She was a year younger than Kamal , yet she had always managed to treat him with an air of superiority as though somehow the mere fact of having been born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Grudgingly , Kamal removed his jacket and shirt . The scar along his neck ran down to an ugly tangle of scar tissue planted like the imprint of a tiger 's claw below his left shoulder blade . Laila gasped at the sight of that most visible heritage of the career her brother had begun crawling under a screen of machinegunfire at a training camp for commandos of the Refusal Front on a windswept plateau above Damascus . " They told me you were dead . " " That 's what the bastards thought when they ran away and left me , " her brother noted . Six times Kamal had taken a squad of fedayeen out of Fatah Land in Southern Lebanon to rocket a kibbutz , mine a road or ambush a passing car . On the seventh , an unsuccessful effort to fire a Katushka rocket into the Haifa oil refineries , his squad had been intercepted by an Israeli patrol . A cluster of well-placed grenades had wounded Kamal and scattered his men . " You were lucky the Israelis did n't finish you off when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has nothing to do with it . It 's because you ca n't interrogatea dead fedayeen . " The Israeli patrol had rushed Kamal to the prisoners ' ward of Tel Aviv 's Tal Hashomer Hospital . There he had lain in a coma for a week until the medical skill of his captors and the vitality of his own constitution had combined to save him . He picked up his beige jacket and drew from its pocket the pendant-shaped vial three inches long that had been in his second airline bag . Laila gasped at the sight of the pale-yellow fluid in its bulbous base . " My jasmine ! " Kamal nodded . His sister grabbed the vial , plucked out its stopperand thrust it to her nostrils . She gulped its odor the way a suffocating man might gasp at the first rush of air flowing from ant ) zoxygen mask . Laila closed her eyes . A world , a forgotten world , swam back at her as the pungent scent invaded her senses . Abdul 's perfume shop in the souk of Old Jerusalem , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musky smells it seemed she could almost caress it between her fingertips . " How did you  --  " she started . " One of our people who was in Jerusalem on a mission brought it out , " Kamal explained . Illicit traffic across the Israeli  --  Jordanian border was something Kamal understood . He had been an illegal export himself , hidden at the bottom of a truckload of oranges after his escape from the prisoners ' ward at Tal Hashomer Hospital . Laila clutched the vial to her breast . " Dear , sweet Abdul , " she said . Her brother started at her phrase . Those blue eyes of his , the eyes that , the family had always joked , were the legacy of an errant Crusader knight 's dalliance with a member of the Dajani clan , seemed to protrude from their sockets , their delicate robin's-egg cast darkened by some interior storm . " Do n't be in a rush to use up that jasmine , " he said . " It happens to be the last your dear , sweet Abdul ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He was executed for treason . " His sister looked unbelievingly at the vial in her hands , then at her brother who had brought it for her . " May I have some tea ? " he asked . Too stunned to speak , Laila turned to the kitchen alcove behind her and prepared to light the gas stove . Her brother continued . " I 've come to see you because I need your help . " Laila spun , the match still sputtering in her hand . She had found her voice . " Why ? Is there some poor grocer down the street you want killed ? " The tone of her brother 's reply was as sharp as the snap of a breaking bone . " Laila , we never kill without a reason . He sold two of our people to the Jews . " He paused , throttling down his anger before he continued . " I want you to convince Whalid to help us in a very important operation . " " Why me ? Why do n't you talk to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? " " Because Whalid and I do n't talk to each other . We only argue. 93And I 'm interested in getting his help , not winning an argument . " Kamal got up and moved to the window overlooking the clinic across the street . " Whalid would never understand what I 've been doing . " Kamal looked out the window , almost melancholy , groping for a phrase , for a thought to explain himself to his sister . " The end justifies the means . " He uttered the words as though they were an original thought he had just discovered , the absolution of a new age designed to be pronounced before rather than after confession . " For me they do . Not for him . Except in those laboratories of his where everything 's an abstraction . " He gestured with his head to the crowded street below . " Never down there where it matters . He 'd call me a criminal , " he said softly . " I 'd call him a coward . After five minutes we would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You never did have much to say to each other , " Laila remarked . " Long before he went into those laboratories of his and you . . . " She paused , searching for a word . Kamal provided it . " Became a terrorist . Or a patriot . The line between them is sometimes thin . " Kamal walked back across the room , gesturing as he did to the kitchen . " You were going to make me a cup of tea , remember ? " Laila set the kettle on her stove and came back to the sitting room . " He 's changed , you know . He 's more French than the French are now . What happened to us , our parents , Palestine  --  all that just seems to have faded away like it was a part of a life he lived in another incarnation . He 's like everyone else . The car . The house . The cleaning woman on Thursdays . His work . His wife . A happily married man , no ? " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Laila , " Kamal 's voice was calm , almost serene . " But he 's not like everyone else . Not for us at least . " His words sent a tremor of apprehension through Laila , confirmingwhat she had suspected from the moment Kamal had mentionedtheir elder brother . " It 's about his work  --  what you 're after ? " Kamal nodded . The kettle whistled . Laila rose . She walked to the alcove , her steps paced off in the slowed rhythm of someone whose mind is lost in thought . So that 's what it is , she told herself . After all the14years , after all the rumors , the angry late-night discussions , they were going to do it now . She set the cups on the table beside Kamal 's chair , the noonday sun highlighting as she did the rich rolls of auburn hair cascading down to her shoulders . She shivered inadvertently as the enormity of what her brother contemplated overwhelmed her . " How in God 's name will we ever get him to help us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an ambulance rushing toward the clinic across the street pierced the noonday quiet . Laila Dajani 's face lit up at the sight of the familiar figure advancing toward her through the crowded waiting room of the Marseilles airport . Her brother Whalid still walked with his splayfootedgait . John Wayne , she had always thought , ambling away from his horse in an old Western . As he drew closer , something else struck Laila about her elder brother . My God , she thought , he 's put on weight ! " Francoise feeds you well , " she laughed . Self-consciously her brother drew in his stomach . " You 're right , " he said . Smiling broadly , Whalid led Laila out of the airport to his Renault16 parked in the airport 's reserved parking area , opposite the arrival lounge . He owed that privilege to a yellow-and-green sticker in one corner of his windshield . It was a security pass to the Nuclear Research Center at Cadarache , the heart of France 's atomic-energy program and , above all , the developmental work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to replace the world 's first generation of nuclear reactors . Whalid Dajani was an expert on the bizarre behavior patterns of one of the most precious and dangerous elements on earth , plutonium . His doctorate thesis for the University of California 's Department of Nuclear Engineering , " A Revised Projection of Neutron Release Across the Plutonium Isotope Spectrum , " had been published in the March 1970 Bulletin of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and stamped him as one of the most brilliant young physicists of his generation . A paper he had delivered on the same subject at a Paris forum in November I973 had prompted the French to offer him a key position in the Phenix program. 95Whalid steered the car out of the parking lot , away from the flashing traffic of the autoroute toward the narrow country road leading to the Provencal inn in which he 'd told his wife , Francoise , to meet them for lunch . After the spontaneous emotion of their greeting , a strained silence fell between brother and sister . Smoking nervously , Laila watched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skeletons , fleeing past her window . As they entered a small village , Whalid glanced at his sister . Her eyes were fixed on the square ahead , its dirt surface baked hard by the sun and the tramping of generations of boules players like the half-dozen men gathered there now , casting their lead balls on it in the pale winter sunshine . You said in your telegram you had something urgent to talk to me about . " A moving car is not a place for a serious conversation , Laila thought . You talk in a car when you want to say something without having to look at the person you 're saying it to . End an affair . Give an order . Announce unpleasant news . But for what she had to say to her brother , she had to be able to watch him , to fix her eyes on his " What a lovely square ! " she said . " So calm . Let 's stop for a drink . " Whalid parked the car , and brother and sister walked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square . Whalid ordered a pastis . Laila hesitated . " No alcohol , " she said . " Try a nice mint tea , ma petite , " the proprietress proposed . She turned and gave Whalid a friendly leer . " Very aphrodisiac . " As she bustled away , Whalid turned to his sister . " What was it you wanted to talk about ? " he prodded gently . " Is it about Kamal ? " Laila 's fingers plucked nervously over the clutter in her handbag until they came on her Gitanes cigarettes . She lit one and inhaled several times . " No , Whalid , it 's about you . " " Me ? " " You . The Brothers need your help . " Whalid felt a twinge of nervous tension cramp his stomach . " Laila , all that 's behind me now . I have a life here , a life I 've worked hard to build . I 've got a wife I love . And I 'm doing some-96thing that I love and that I know is important . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brothers . Not for anyone . " Whalid could not help thinking of the lithe blond French girl who would be waiting for them at lunch . He had met Franroise in the Cadarache senior employees ' restaurant . Passing her a mustard pot , they liked to joke . She had given him so much : a sense of place at last , a meaning to his existence that gave dimension to the work in which he so passionately believed . Their **26;8031;TOOLONG in the little medieval city of Meyrargues was for Whalid a citadel , a citadel his beautiful wife was helping to build against the encroaching tides of his past . Beside him , Laila sipped her tea . " Whalid , you can never escape your past . Palestine is your home . Jerusalem . Not here . " Whalid did not answer . Brother and sister sat side by side a moment , united in silence by the bond of the suffering they had once shared . Neither had ever known the horror of life in a Palestinianrefugee camp , but the pain of their exile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They represented a face of the Palestinian problem that a world used to the stereotyped miseriesof the camps rarely saw : a Palestine that had once produced the Arab world 's elite , a proud flow of scholars , doctors , businessmen , scientists . Forty-five successive generations of Dajanis had dwelt upon the hillsides of Jerusalem , deeding the city an unending flow of Arab leaders and thinkers , until 1947 . Twice since then , in 1948 and again in 1967 , Israeli gunfire had driven them from their homes . Israeli bulldozers had reduced their graceful ancestral dwelling to rubble in 1968 to make way for a new apartment complex . Three months later , their father had died of a broken heart in his Beirut exile . Whalid took his sister 's hand in his and softly caressed it . " My heart screams out against what happened to us , just as loudly as yours or anyone else 's , " he said . " But it 's not the only thing it screams out for . I suppose now Palestine is the only cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Laila fell silent , reflecting on what her brother had just said . " Whalid , " she asked after a long sip of her tea , " do you remember the last time we were all together ? " Whalid nodded . It was the evening after his father 's funeral . You said something that night I 've always remembered . Kamal was leaving for Damascus to join the Brothers to get vengeance for97our people . He wanted you to go with him and you said no . The Israelis were so strong , you said , because they understood what education meant . You 'd been accepted to do your doctorate in California . Berkeley was going to be your Damascus , you told us . Getting the best scientific education in the world was going to be your way of helping your people and the cause . " " I remember . And so ? " Laila glanced at the square , at the boules players , at the darkrobedwomen gossiping in front of the Prisunic , cord shopping bags bulging in their hands . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all this ? " " Right here , " Whalid replied , tapping his chest . " Where it always was , in my heart . " " Please , Whalid , " his sister entreated , " do n't get angry . I wanted to say you were right that night . Each of us has to help the cause in his own way . With what he has . Maybe carrying messages to Beirut in my bra is n't much of a contribution . But it 's what I can do . Kamal fights . That 's his way . But you 're special , Whalid . There are thousands , hundreds of thousands , of us who can carry a Kalishnikov . But there 's only one Palestinian in the world who can do for his people what you can . " Whalid sipped his pastis and turned a cold , appraising regard to Laila . And just what is this special thing the Brothers expect me to do for our people ? " " Help them to steal plutonium . But not for themselves , Whalid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He lowered his pastis to the table . Instinctively , he looked around to see if there was anyone in earshotwho could overhear them . He ran his fingers across his forehead , feeling as he did the little beads of sweat that had formed there . " I suppose the Brothers think I can just put a few kilos of plutoniumin the back seat of my car some Sunday afternoon and drive out of Cadarache with it ? " " Whalid , " Laila replied , " the Brothers are many things , but they are not crazy . The whole thing has already been thought over and studied in great detail . All the Brothers want from you is information . Where the plutonium is stored . How it 's guarded . How many people protect it . Some idea of how they can get in and out of Cadarache without getting caught . " She opened her purse and picked through its contents until shecame upon a thick white envelope . " What the Brothers need to know is all set out here . And I 'm authorized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where it came from . No one will ever be able to trace it back to you . " " And suppose I refuse ? " " You wo n't . " His sister 's smug reply , the presumptuousness of those who had sent her to him , infuriated her brother . " I wo n't ? " he said in a hoarse whisper . " Well , I do ! Right now ! And I 'm going to tell you why . " He grabbed for her pack of cigarettes . His gesture prevented him from seeing the expression sweeping across his sister 's face . It remained there just an instant , a strange , distant glance full of compassion and horror , fear and respect . " I believe in what I do , Laila . I believe in it as passionately as I ever believed in Palestine . " He paused , inhaling slowly . Despite the passion of his words , his tone was grave and measured . " FlorenceNightingale once said , The first thing a hospital should not do is spread germs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not do is spread this terrifying knowledge he has so man kills himself with it instead of using it to build a better world . " This time it was his sister 's turn to erupt . " A better world ! " she said scornfully . " Why does Qaddafi want the bomb ? Because the Israelis have it . You know damn well they do . Do you think they got it to build a better world with ? Like hell ! To use on us if they have to . " Her brother remained impassive . " Yes , I know they have it . " " And you can sit here beside me , admit the Israelis have it , and still tell me you wo n't help your own people , your own people who 've been trampled on like no other people in the world , to get it ? " I can . And I am , because I feel a commitment to something higher than Palestine . Or the cause . Or whatever you want to callit.  --  " Higher than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Brother and sister were silent for a moment , each spent by the intensity of their argument . The midday sun was warm now and the stucco houses across the square seemed to radiate a terra-rosa glow in the bright light . The knot of hangers-on around the boules game had thickened , and the sound of their muttered commentslapped at the edge of the square , wavelets of a gentle sea sliding along a beach . " The answer is no , Laila . I 'm not going to do it . " A sense of emptiness , of despair filled Laila . For a second she felt physically ill . A pair of boys , perhaps twelve years old , set their skateboards onto the hard-packed square . In an instant , they were swinging through it with the gentle grace of birds cruising a summer sky . Laila glanced at her brother 's forearm . On the inside of his wrist , just above the steel band of his Rolex Submariner watch , was a tattoo , a blue serpent entwined around a heart pierced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly , almost sensually , scratched the surface of the tattoo with her crimson fingernail . " And this ? " she asked . He looked at her , furious . That tattoo was a souvenir of the most painful moment of his life , the death of his father after their exile from Jerusalem in 1968 . The day of his funeral , he and Kamal had gone to a Saudi Arabian tattoo artist in the souks of Beirut . The Saudi had fixed that design on the flesh of each brother 's forearm : a pierced heart for their lost father , a serpent for the hatred they bore those responsible for his death , a dagger for the vengeance they had sworn to obtain . Then they had sworn together a vow from the fourth chapter of the Koran to use their lives to avenge their father 's death under pain of losing them if they faltered in their pursuit . Laila saw his muscles twitching . At least , she thought , I 've given a face to the people , to the cause , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . Her voice was tender ; there was no hint of reproach in its tone . " You 've been able to forget here with your new life , your wife . But how about the ones who did n't ? Are they to be a people without a home foreover ? Without an address ? Is our own father 's body never to go home again ? " Whalid looked at the tattoo under his watchband , glowering at it as though somehow his glare might erase its stigmata from his flesh . " What am I supposed to be ? " His voice was an angry , sibilant hiss . " A prisoner of this skin because I was born with it ? Do I have to go against my reason , against the things I believe in , just because I was horn in a place called Palestine thirty-eight years ago  --  ? .. 1(X)Laila waited a long and thoughtful moment before answering . " Yes , Whalid , " she said . " You do . I do . We all do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sister drove back to the airport in silence . Laila went immediately to the check-in counter to register for her return flight to Paris . When she had finished , she walked across the airport lounge toward the newsstand where Whalid scanned the headlines of the evening papers . His dark eyes seemed distant and melancholy , shutters turning his vision back into some interior world of his own . He 's understood , Laila thought . He 's miserable , but he knows he has no choice . She laid a hand on his elbow . " I 'll tell them it 's all right . You 'll do it . " Whalid flicked the pages of a magazine on the kiosk before him , an unconscious effort to postpone a few seconds the terrible decisionhis sister 's words had thrust on him . " No , Laila , " he said finally . " Tell them I wo n't do it . " His sister felt her legs tremble . She thought for an instant she would retch on the airport floor . " Whalid , " she whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Whalid shook his head . The sound of his own voice saying " No " had dispelled his lingering indecision . " I said No , ' Laila , and I meant it . " Laila was pale , her eyes blinking , unfocused . He does n't understand , she thought . Or if he does , he does n't give a damn . " Whalid , you must . You must . " He shook his head . Laila understood . There was no appealing his decision now . To her horror , she realized that she had failed . Fingers trembling , she opened her pocketbook and took out a secondenvelope , this one much smaller . " They told me to give you this if you said no , " she said , pressing the envelope into her brother 's hands . Whalid began to open it . Her fingers closed over his . " Wait until I 've left . " Laila pressed her cheek , damp with tears , against her brother 's . " Ma salaam , " she whispered . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airport as his sister crossed the tarmac to her waiting flight . She did not turnio1back . As she disappeared into the 727 's rear hatch , he opened the envelope clutched in his hands . Glancing at the single sheet of paper it contained , he staggered . He had recognized instantly both the verse from the fourth chapter of the Koran and the handwriting in which it was written . " And if they turn back from their vow , " it read , " take them and kill them , wherever ye find them . " On Sunday , March 3 , 1977 , explaining to Francoise that he had family business in Paris , Whalid Dajani boarded the Mistral , the French railroad 's crack express , for the French capital . Shortly before midnight that evening , the doorbell 's raw screech shattered the quiet of Francoise Dajani 's darkened bedroom . At the sight of the three shadowy figures gathered on her doorstep , the identificationcard with its official tricolor slashes thrust sharply at her half-closed eyes , Francoise gasped . Oh my God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's dead . The three agents of the Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire pushed abruptly past her into the living room . " What is it ? " she cried . " Has something happened to my hus-band ? " Ignoring her , two of the agents headed upstairs toward her bedroom . " Where are you going ? What do you think you 're doing ? " she shrieked after them . The leader of the trio , a stout florid man , grabbed her by the shoulders . " Get dressed , " he ordered . " Immediately . Pack a bag with whatever toilet articles you will need for the next seventy-two hours . " Frangoise protested . The agent reached into his pocket for the only explanation he was prepared to offer her , a brief typewritten order from ajuge d'instruction , authorizing the DST to detain her for seventy-two hours . Frangoise moved toward the telephone . " I 'm going to call my father , " she announced angrily . The agent reached the phone first . He locked the receiver into its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no calls . " In2Not quite an hour later , Francoise Dajani was led into the office of the regional director of the DST , located on the twelfth floor of a commercial office building overlooking the Vieux-Port of Marseilles . Outside , the mistral moaned through the deserted streets , tearing at the wooden shutters of the old buildings nearby , its violent gusts rattling the plate-glass windows of the director 's office . The regional director , studiously ignoring her presence , scrutinizeda report on his desk . Finally he pushed it aside and looked up at her with the cold , appraising air of an insurance adjuster trying to downgrade a claim . We arrested your husband in Paris this afternoon . Together with his brother and sister . " " Arrested him ? " Francoise gasped . " For what ? " " For planning to steal plutonium from the nuclear installations at Cadarache for the benefit of the Palestine Liberation Organiza-tion . " The slender blond woman tightened the muscles around her eyes , fighting a flow of tears . " I do n't believe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you believe me or not . They were traced through an Israeli agent who saw your brotherin-lawarriving at Charles de Gaulle Airport . They were arrested with the evidence of their guilt on them . All three have confessed . My only concern is whether or not you were involved in their crime . There was not even a hint of sympathy for her in the middleagedDST agent , only the professional interrogator 's search for the revealing flicker of the eyes , the subtle shift in vocal tone , that would expose his quarry . " Where are you holding my husband ? " The director glanced at his watch . " We 're not . He 'll be landing in Beirut in two hours . And he will not return to France  --  ever . The government has declared him persona non grata , although , in the circumstances , he has every reason to consider himself fortunate . It has been so decided by higher authority . " Just how high even the DST agent did not realize . Developing the Super-Phenix breeder reactor for overseas sale was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 198os . The public revelation in a trial that a group of Palestinians had formulateda plan to steal plutonium from Cadarache could have been a devastating blow to the program in a Europe already alive withto3antinuclear sentiments . Rather than run that risk , the Minister of the Interior , with the President 's concurrence , had ordered the three Dajanis deported . Francoise sagged in her chair . Instinctively , her fingers went to the wafer-thin gold medallion around her neck . It was a representation of the fish which , on the walls of ancient Rome 's catacombs , had symbolized the early Christians . She was a Pisces , and her father had given it to her on the eve of their marriage . She adored her father as she had never adored anyone else , even her husband . She had been a sickly child , and it was he who had nursed her , given her the strength to live . What had happened would leak out one day and then the gossip would start , the vile , vicious gossip . It would kill her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly ravaginga vital organ . Beyond the director 's window , twelve stories below , Francoise could see the blink of the Jardin du Pharo at the throat of the Vieux-Port . She listened to the desolate wail of the mistral , the sad music of her childhood , and saw herself as a young girl standing on the quay of the Vieux-Port with her father watching the fishing dories bobbing in the choppy blue sea . Despair , a bitter unreasoning despair at what her husband 's act would do to him , sickened her . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " I feel ill . May I have a glass of water ? " The DST official was only a few strides from his office on his way to the toilet down the hall when he heard the shattering of his plate-glass windows . For just an instant there on his mother 's balcony , his eyes idly roving the long and gentle swell of the Mediterranean , Kamal Dajani was at peace . To his left were the familiar crags of Pigeon Rock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbor since the Phoenicians had first planted their venturingtriremes on the outgoing tide . Below Kamal 's perch , along the coastal road , sweeping up the seashore from Al Maza Airport , was a gigantic open-air market : thousands of merchants , driven from the city center by the Lebanese civil war , hawking everything from eggs to transistor radios and Dior dresses off blankets tossed on the roadside , folding camp tables , out of automobile trunks . The Lebanese , Kamal thought contemptuously  --  the only thing they prefer to killing each other is making money . That scornfultooobservation brought Kamal back to reality . Failure did not sit well with him , and the failure of his operation could not have been more complete . He had only one minor consolation : they had managed , thanks to his muttered Arabic injunction to the others , to conceal their Libyan connection from the French . The DST had been only too ready to accept the idea that they were in the employ of the PLO . Kamal 's only concern at the moment was salvaging what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could not deliver to Muammar al-Qaddafi the plutonium he wanted , perhaps he could deliver something else , something which in the long run might prove far more valuable : the scientific genius of his brother . " A table ! " Kamal turned at his mother 's words . Whatever their diverse accomplishments , their violent careers , her three children still instinctivelyobeyed the imperious commands of Sulafa Dajani . Small wonder . She was an imposing figure , the very antithesis of the stereotyped image of the Arab woman . No veil had ever shrouded her face . Her tall , lithe figure was clothed in a black Saint-Laurent suit , its beautifully tailored lines clinging to each indentation of a body that could still command lovers closer to her children 's age than hers . A single strand of pearls set off the pale skin of her long graceful neck and the haughty cast of her chin . Her hair was black , close-cropped and curly , a few defiant streaks of gray illuminating it like flashes of light . To her , her children 's summary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not need to know what their crime was . It had been committed for the cause and that was enough . Spread out on her living-room table was a huge Arabic mezze , a tapestry of hors d'oeuvres . She poured each child a glass of arak , **29;8059;TOOLONG liquid , and raised her own in a toast . " To the memory of your father ; to the freedom of your people ; to the liberation of your land , " she said and swallowed the burning alcohol in one gulp . Not all the injunctions of Islam were to her liking . Laila and Kamal turned hungrily on the food . The mother thrust a sumboussac , a delicate meat pastry , at her disconsolate elder son . " Eat , " she commanded . IOSWhalid listlessly nibbled at its crust . " What do you intend to do ? " He shrugged . " I do n't know . It depends on what Francoise wants to do when she gets here . If she comes . If she can forgive me for what I did . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is her duty . " " Whalid . " Kamal 's tone was wary . He did not know how much of his brother 's bitterness at what had happened was directed at him . " Why do n't you come to Libya with me ? " " Waste my life in that Godforsaken place ? " " That Godforsaken place may surprise you . " Kamal continued . " There is more happening there than you know . Or most people know . " Kamal stretched his heavy torso . " A man like you should never have a closed mind . At least come . Take a look . And then decide . " A telephone rang . Sulafa Dajani rose to answer it . None of her children noticed the faint glistening in her eyes when she returned and sat next to her elder son . Gently , she reached for his hand and pressed it to her lips . " My son , I 'm so sorry . It was an officer of the French Embassy . Francoise is dead . " " Dead ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She jumped from a very high building while the police were questioning her . " Whalid slumped against his mother 's shoulder . " Oh my God , " he sobbed . " Francoise , my poor Francoise . " Kamal got up and lit a cigarette . He stared at his weeping brother . " I did it , " Whalid cried . " I killed her . " Kamal circled behind him and squeezed his shoulders with his powerful fingers . If there was any pity in his gesture it was not so much for his brother 's grief as for his stupidity . " Whalid , you did n't kill her . They did . " Whalid looked at him , uncomprehending . " You do n't believe that she jumped from that window , do you ? " Alarm and horror swept his brother 's grief-ravaged face . " The French police would n't ... " " Do n't he a poor fool ! They threw her out of that window , for God 's sake . Those French you loved so much . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think happened ? " Kamal was flinginghis words in short , bitter bursts . " And God knows what they did to her first . " Whalid turned to his mother , blinking through tears of sorrow and disbelief , searching for knowledge , for consolation . Sulafa Dajani shrugged her graceful shoulders . " It is the way of all our enemies . " She kissed her first son 's forehead . " Go to Libya with your brother . You belong there now . B'is Allah  --  it is God 's will . " 107PART IIIMONDAY , DECEMBER 14 : MIDNIGHT TO 3:27 A.M. " Destroy Libya . " HE ONLY SOUND REACHING MUAMMAR AL-QADdafi'sears was the low and mournful sigh of a distant wind . No Teleprinter 's hum , no radio 's cackle , no jangling telephone marred the perfect quiet of his desert . As was only natural , he had chosen to pass the critical hours preceding the test of his hydrogen bomb in the solitude of the spaces in which he had found his faith and nurtured his dreams . His command post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he strove to reorder the future , his ever present Bedouin tent . Not a single manifestation of the technology he sought to harness intruded on its spartan precincts . There were no television screens here parading the world before his eyes , no smartly uniformed aides laying out the options available to him , no blinking panels of light to remind him of the strength of his massed armies . Qaddafi was alone with the oneness of the desert and the stillness of his soul . Here , he knew , there was neither the time nor the place for the useless or the complex . As the oncoming light of day stripped away the illusions of the night , so the emptiness of these expanses stripped life to its fundamentals . All here gave way to the inexorablestruggle to survive . Since time immemorial the intensity of that struggle had made the desert the incubator of the spiritual , its inhuman solitude the catalyst that had driven men to the extreme . Moses in the Sinai , Christ in the wilderness , the Prophet on his Hegira : each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engendered by their desert retreats . Others had , too : visionaries and zealots , fanatics and spiritualists , part of the unending parade of austere and alarming men that through the centuries had emerged from those trackless wastes to trouble the settled world around them . Immersed now in the reassuring familiarity of his desert , theIIIlatest of that long and troubling line awaited the results of his test in perfect calm . If it had worked , it was now , he reasoned , in their first flash of anger , that the Americans would lash out against him . If that was God 's will , then he was ready to perish here in the surroundings that had formed him . If it had failed , he would have one course open : he would condemn the " plot " fomented within his borders , arrest a few Palestinians and stage a mock trial to mollify the anger of the Americans and the world . His alert ears picked up the flutter of a helicopter coming to announce the result , to return him to his capital in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , then fluttered to rest fifty yards from his tent . A man leaped out . " Ya sidi ! " he shouted . " It worked ! " His first reaction to the news was to bow his head in prayer , a prayer of awe and gratitude for the power that now rested in his hands . Woven into the multicolored strands of the prayer rug on which he bowed his head were the outlines of the Islamic sanctuary which with that power he would now claim in the name of his faith and his people , Jerusalem 's Mosque of Omar . The President of the United States sat motionless at the head of the conference table in the National Military Command Center . He too had greeted the desert explosion with a prayer , a prayer for help in what he had instantly understood was the gravest crisis his nation had ever faced . Now he was staring straight ahead , his index finger pressed to his lips , every fiber of his being concentrated on the dilemma before him . " The first thing I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all our actions must be based on the assumption that there is a hydrogen bomb hidden in New York , " the President continued . " And we have also got to assume that Qaddafi is deadly serious when he threatens to detonate it if any word of this gets to the public . " In a strange way , the President thought , he may have done us a service . If word of this ever got out , we 'd probably have an outburst of public opinion that would close down every option we have except forcing the Israelis out of the West Bank . He leaned forward and folded his hands on the table , letting his glance travel over his advisers ranged around the table , then the military men atII2their command consoles . " I do n't think I need remind any of you of the moral obligation this places on everyone here . There are certainly some of us who have persons very close to us who may be threatened by this . But each of us has got to remember that the lives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secret . " " Jack  --  " he glanced at his National Security Assistant  --  " do you have any specifics to recommend on that ? " " Well , sir , it goes without saying , only use secure telephones when talking about it . " It was well known in Washington that the Soviets intercepted microwave calls in and out of the White House  --  just as the United States monitored those going to the Kremlin . " And no secretaries . If anyone has to write anything , write it by hand . With no carbons . " " How do we keep this from the press ? " Bennington asked . It was a vital question . There were two thousand journalists accredited to the White House . Forty or fifty of them were in almost constant attendance on its grounds during the day , the most able among them convinced on arising each morning that the governmentwould lie to them at least once before sundown . Leaks were a way of life in the capital , and gossip on government secrets the main topics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Duke Zeibert 's and Jean Pierre 's where its luminariespicked each other 's brains as assiduously as they picked their Maryland soft-shelled crab . " Should we tell the press secretary ? " the President asked . " I 'm not sure , " Eastman replied . " If we do n't , his reaction will be more natural if he gets any queries on it . But if we do tell him , he 'd damn well better be prepared to lie , stonewall and deny this damn thing right into the ground . " " If we do tell him , " William Webster of the FBI drawled , " he can tell us right away if anyone in the media 's focusing in on it . " " Do n't worry , " Eastman said , " if anyone in the media starts to focus in , we 'll hear about it fast enough . The most important thing is to hold this as close as possible . The Kennedy people held on to the Missile Crisis for a week because only fifteen people in the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain the facade of a normal existence . That 's the best way to keep the press off the track . " The President indicated his agreement , then shifted his attention to the admiral commanding the center . He ordered him to begin their stock-taking with the traditional appraisal of the military situationand the options open to the U.S. armed forces . The Admiral stepped back to the speaker 's stand . Eastman could not suppress a smile . Even at a moment like this , the Admiral moved automatically into his Pentagon " briefer 's stance , " feet a rigid six inches apart , left hand in the small of his back , his right wielding the absolute end in briefer 's sex , a collapsible aluminum pointer with a glowing light on its tip with which he once again reviewed the Soviet 's military posture . Nothing had changed . Notingthat , Harold Brown , the Secretary of Defense , intervened . " Mr. President , I would suggest our first action should be to alert the Soviets to what has happened . However strained our relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their help in bringing Qaddafi to ground . Furthermore , they should be made aware that any military moves we make are not being directed against them . " The President agreed . " Open up the Red Line , " he commanded Eastman , " and inform the Soviets I 'd like to speak with the Chair-man . " " Sir , " Warren Christopher , the Deputy Secretary of State , said , " I think it 's also essential we coordinate with our allies any actions we take and keep them informed of this at the highest level . I 'd like authorization to get off Eyes Only ' messages to Mrs. Thatcher , Helmut Schmidt and , above all , President Giscard . We 've got to assume the source of Qaddafi 's plutonium for the atomic trigger of that bomb was his French reactor . The French may be able to turn up information for us on the people Qaddafi has involved in this that will help the Bureau run them down . " The President gave his approval , then ordered the Admiral to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights on the semidarkened screen indicated the positions of all the ships of the Sixth Fleet , most of them gathered off Crete on an anti  --  **25;8090;TOOLONG . They represented the U.S. forces closest to Libya , and , the Admiral told the assembly , they could be ordered to start southwest immediately . Harry Fuller , the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs , broke into his briefing . " Mr. President , I think there 's one point that needs to be clarified right away . There is no viable military solution to this crisis . Sure , we can destroy Libya . Instantly . But that 's not going to give us any guarantee whatsoever that his h0nlh if ' it 's in NewYork  --  wo n't explode . And that , in my judgment , precludes our taking any military action against Qaddafi for the time being . " " I 'm afraid I have to agree with that , " the President noted grimly . " What do you recommend we do , then ? " " Every move we make , " the Admiral declared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ klaxon sounding general quarters , " has got to be designed to remind Qaddafi of the potential consequences of his action . He 's got to be kept aware every hour , every minute , every second of this damned crisis that we can thermonuclearizehim in the blink of an eye . Let him live , eat and breathe that and see how he likes it . " The Admiral waved a hand at the red lights flashing on the screen . " I agree we should send the Sixth Fleet hell for leather for the Libyan coast . If they 've got any liberty parties ashore , they 'll just have to leave them on the beach . Once they get there , I 'd put them right up against his coastline where his radar 's sure to pick them up . Run a high-altitude aerial screen up and down the coastlinefrom the carriers and tell the pilots to talk in the clear so he 's constantly reminded they 're carrying enough missiles to turn that goddamn country of his into an instant ruin . " A dour smile ap-. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of force in a situationlike this is designed to alter your enemy 's perception of his actions . Maybe this will alter his . " " Mr. President . " There it was again , that rasping drawl of Crandell 's . " You 're not going to like what I 'm going to say , but I 'm going to say it anyway . Destroy Qaddafi . Right now . " The Chief Executive gave his Energy Secretary a look of illconcealedexasperation . It did nothing to staunch the flow of his unsolicited advice . " The great mistake we made in Iran was not acting the very first day they took those hostages . The whole world would have understoodus if we had . We waited and what happened ? Everybody was holding us by the coattails . Do n't do anything rash . Think about our oil . Think about the Russians . ' " " Mr. Crandell , we 're not talking about fifty hostages in an embassy . " The President almost spat the words at his Energy Secretary . Despite the placid surface he turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of considerable temper , capable , when angered , of lacerating meanness . " We 're talking about five million people and New York City . " " We 're talking about this country , Mr. President , and a man who 's declared war on us . We 've got to show him and everybody else on this globe that there 's a limit beyond which we are n't going to be pushed . Mark my words , if you do n't respond to this man , challenge right now , tell him he 's got five minutes to tell you where that bomb 's hidden or he and his country are dead "  --  Crandell was waving a pudgy finger across the table  --  " then before this night is over you 'll be ready to betray this nation 's friends to satisfy a blackmailer . " " Crandell . " The President had paled under his efforts to rein in his temper . " When I want military advice from you I 'll call for it . I 'm not going to put the lives of five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every possible avenue of saving them and this world from an unspeakable catastrophe . " " By talking , Mr. President , and once you 've started talking you 'll start compromising . Everybody always does . " The President turned angrily away from his Energy Secretary . To lose his temper , whatever the provocation , in front of his advisersat this moment would be a disaster . Crandell looked at him , slowly shaking his head . Just like that good old boy , he thought , so nice , a guy spits in his face he thinks it 's raining . At the far end of the table , Bennington had just picked up his telephone . The CIA head listened for a moment . " Excuse me , sir , but it looks like we 've got another problem on our hands . " Every eye in the room turned to the New Englander . " Mossad 's just got onto the Agency . They picked up the explosion on their seismographs . They 're very suspicious that it was a nuclear shot and want to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " someone groaned from the end of the table . " If they find out what Qaddafi 's done , they 'll take him out on their own and we may lose New York . " The President frowned . It had been almost inevitable that the Israelis would pick up the shock waves . As long as they did n't spot the fallout , though , they 'd have doubts , and none of the fallout was heading their way . Right now what he needed was time , time to get the planning in order , time to get a grip on the problem before them . " Stall , " he ordered Bennington . " Tell them it looks like an earthquake . Tell them we 're checking it out and we 'll keep them informed . " On the wall opposite the President , the hank of clocks showed it i 16was 12:30 A.M. , 7:30 in Jerusalem and Tripoli . They had thirtyeightand a half hours left , and every minute of them had to be made to count . " Gentlemen , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to address ourselves to in order of their importance . First is New York : what do we do about it ? " He twisted in his chair to face Harold Brown . Civil defense fell under his sprawling Defense Department umbrella . " Do we have a plan to get these people out of New York in an emergency ? " " Mr. President , Jack Kennedy asked that question about Miami on the second day of the Cuban Missile Crisis . " Brown sighed . " It took two hours to get the answer then , and it was no . Well , I can answer you this time in two seconds . It 's still no . " " Do n't forget , " Eastman warned , " he 's threatening to detonate that thing if we start an evacuation . He considers those people his hostages . " The President looked at his adviser . There was an infinity of sadness in his pale-blue eyes . " Do we take him at his word on that , Jack ? " " I 'm afraid we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might mean five million lives ? " " It could mean five million lives if we call his bluff and he 's not bluffing . " The helicopter bearing Muammar al-Qaddafi back to his capital settled down on a landing pad concealed in a grove of Aleppo pines nineteen miles southeast of Tripoli at 7:52 Libyan time . The dictator leaped out and slid into the driver 's seat of a sky-blue Volkswagen hidden in the midst of the trees . Four minutes later , followed by a jeepload of his red-bereted Praetorian Guard , he passed through a barrier of electrified barbed wire and headed down a long alley of cypress trees leading to the Mediterranean shore . No foreign diplomat , no distinguished visitor , none of Qaddafi 's fellow Arab leaders had ever been invited into the elegant old dwelling set at the end of the drive . With its finely wrought balustrade , the Doric columns supporting its portico , the Villa Pietri looked like a Roman nobleman 's villa that had somehow been misplaced on the edge of the African continent . It had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the117nobility of the textile trade , who had left his name on it . In the years following his death , the Villa Pietri had served as the palace of Mussolini 's Fascist Governor General of Libya , as the residence of the brother of Libya 's King Idris , and later of the commanding general of the U.S. Air Force 's Wheelus Base outside Tripoli . The first chief of state in modern times to employ terrorism as an instrument of national policy had taken over the noble old dwelling in 1971 . It was the headquarters from which Qaddafi directed the global activities of his terrorist network . The Munich Olympic Massacre had been planned in its gracious sitting room ; so , too , had the assault on the Rome Airport meant to kill Henry Kissinger in December 1973 , the kidnapping of the OPEC oil ministers , the Entebbe skyjacking . The eucalyptus trees of the villa 's gardens concealed the antennas that radioed Qaddafi'sorders to IRA provos , West German students , Red Brigade dissidents , even Islamic zealots infiltrated into Tashkent and Turkestan . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Tuscan hills had been turned into an ultramodern communications center , hooked into , among other things , Libya 's radar installations ; one of its bedrooms housed a complete mockupof the control panels of a Boeing 747 and 707 on which many of the hijackers of the early and mid-seventies had been trained . The Libyan leader himself had assigned those who went out from the villa to do his bidding their leitmotif : " Everything that puts an infected thorn in the foot of our enemies is good . " Qaddafi was radiant with triumph as he drew up to the villa . " Now , " he announced to a handful of aides waiting to greet him at the villa 's doorstep , " I shall no longer have to endure being an Arab President who stands by while my Palestinian brothers are stripped of the last shreds of their homeland . " He embraced each in turn , his Prime Minister Salam Jalloud , one of the few members of his original junta still with Qaddafi , his chief of intelligence , the commanders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into his study . " They are criminals , these Israelis , " he declared . " The whole world has stood by watching them stealing our brothers ' lands with these settlements of theirs . Watching while a people is being systematicallydeprived of its homeland . This so-called peace of that coward Sadat . What a mockery ! A peace , for what ? To allow the Israelis to go on and on stealing our brothers ' lands . Autonomy , they said . " Qaddafi laughed . " Autonomy for what ? To let the foreigner take away your home ! " Qaddafi sighed . " I dreamt of leading a people that did not sleep at night ; that spent its days in the djebels training for the reconquestof its Palestinian brothers ' lands ; that respects God 's Holy Law and obeys the Koran because it wants to be an example to the rest . " And what do I lead ? A people that sleeps at night . A people that does n't care what happens to its brothers in Palestine . A people that dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We trained our best young men to fly Mirage jets in the battle and what did they do ? They went down to the souks to open a shop and sell Japanese air-conditioners . " The intensity on the Libyan dictator 's face mesmerized the men around him . " Now , " he went on , " with our bomb , why do we care if we are only a small power ? Let the people go on dreaming of their Mercedes . I do n't need the millions now , only the few who are ready to pay the price I ask . Did the Caliph conquer the world with the millions ? No ! With the few , because the few were strong and believed . " Qaddafi contemplated the tabletop a moment , staring at the waterycircles left upon it by the bottles of soda his aides had drunk waiting for the test . Although he did not say it , he knew that successwould make him , overnight , the hero of the Arab world , the idol of its masses . It would secure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish state , bringing the Arab world with its vast oil resources and the power they represented under his command . Salam Jalloud , the Prime Minister , shifted nervously in his chair . He was the one man in the room who had opposed Qaddafi 's scheme from the outset . " I still say , Sidi , the Americans will destroyus . Or they will plot with the Israelis to trick us , to make us think they are going to do what we ask , then strike when our guard is down . " " Our guard must never be down . " Qaddafi indicated a small black device on his desk . It looked like a miniature dictating machine . " From now on , this is our guard . " The device , another contribution of the engineers of Nippon Electric , resembled the remote-control boxes which can open a garage door from a movingI 1 9car . By tapping it with his finger , Qaddafi could send an electronic pulse to a room deep in a specially reinforced cellar of the villa . There , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terminal which , in response to that gesture , would send his detonation code to Oscar and the bomb hidden in New York . " The Americans are not fools , " he continued . " Do you think five million Americans are going to die for Israel ? For those settlementseven they oppose ? Never ! They are going to force Israel to give us everything we want . " " Besides , " he said , " we need no longer be afraid of the Americans . Until now they have been able to ignore our rights , to help the Israelis trample on the nationhood of our Palestinian brothers because they were a superpower . They were immune . Well , my friends , " a thin , drawn smile appeared on his features , " they are still a superpower , but they are no longer immune . " In Washington , the President had left the Crisis Committee'smeeting at the National Military Command Center to confer with Moscow on the red telephone line . While he was out of the room , his advisers gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , white jacketed Navy stewardsslipped among them passing out steaming cups of freshly brewed coffee . Only Jack Eastman remained seated at the conference table , skimming through a stack of documents , most of them stamped " Top Secret . " He had to call on every resource of the discipline acquired in a lifetime of military service to concentrate on the material before him , to drive from his mind the ghastly spectacle they had all witnessed . His job was to sort out the dimensions of this crisis , to lay the options the United States had before the President as conciselyand as clearly as possible  --  even if those options were only variations of the unthinkable . He picked up a four-volume blue plan labeled " Federal Responseto Peacetime Nuclear Emergencies . " Millions of dollars of taxpayers ' money , thousands of man-hours of effort had gone into preparing that plan . After one quick perusal , Eastman tossed it aside in disgust . New York would have been reduced to a charred graveyard before he or anyone else had been able to make sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the lieutenant colonel at the NMCC command console announced . The Chief Executive strode briskly back into the chamber and was addressing the men in it before they had had time to sit down . " I 've spoken with the Chairman , " he announced . " He assures me that the Soviet Union condemns Qaddafi 's threat without reserve , and has offered to cooperate with us in any way he can . He is personally addressing a message to Qaddafi through his ambassadorin Tripoli condemning what he 's done and warning him of the consequences of his action . " " Mr. President ? " It was the Deputy Secretary of State . " As a corollary of that I 'd recommend we orchestrate along with Moscow , Peking and Paris a worldwide diplomatic assault on Qaddafi to show him that he 's absolutely isolated . Cut off from any vestige of support anywhere in the world . " " Do it , Warren , " the President ordered , " although I 'm afraid we 're not dealing here with a man who 'll be responsive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Secretary back from South America . " The President remembered how effectively John F. Kennedy had used a cold to cover his return to Washington from Chicago at the beginning of the Missile Crisis . " Tell him to pretext some health reason . " " We 've also , Mr. President , " Eastman said , " got the constitutionalaspects of this thing to consider . We have to bring in the Governor and , much more important because he 's on the firing line , the Mayor . " " There , " mused the President , " is a potential problem . " The Mayor was a volatile , outspoken man who might go off half cocked if he was n't handled properly . " I think we better lay it on him face to face down here . " " And I think you 'll also have to brief the Congressional leader-ship . " " Yes , but we 'll hold it very , very tight . Find out exactly whom Kennedy brought into the early stages of the Missile Crisis . " The President leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cradle of his forefinger and gave his National Security Assistant an appraisingglance . " Jack , what plan of action do you recommend ? " Eastman shuffled the papers in front of him for just a second . Then , with the low but commanding voice he had acquired in his years in the military , he began . " It seems to me , Mr. President , we 've only got two practical approaches open to us to resolve thisproblem . The first is actually finding and disarming this device . You 've given the brief on that to the FBI and the CIA . The second is getting to Qaddafi and convincing him that whatever his complaintsagainst Israel are , threatening to destroy New York is a totally irrational and irresponsible way of resolving them . " It occurs to me , Mr. President , that , as you said earlier , this is the ultimate terrorist situation . What we have here is a fanatic holding a gun to the heads of five million people . We 've got to talk that gun out of his hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he wants anyway , just the way you 'd maneuver a terrorist into a negotiating position in a hijacking situation . We 've got a lot of people around with expertise on how to do it . I recommendwe bring them together to give us their guidance . " " All right , " the President agreed . " Get the best people we have into session at the White House immediately . " " Mr. President ? " This time it was the Army Chief of Staff . " I think we 're overlookingone very vital point here . I agree that as long as there 's a chance of that hydrogen device going off in New York we 've got no military options open against Libya . That does n't mean , however , that we should n't be preparing for the possibility of military action . " The President 's chin thrust forward at his words . " Not against Libya . Against Israel . " " Israel ? " " Israel , Mr. President . The bottom line of this crisis is that if that bomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're going to have the lives of five million Americans at risk . Against those people in those settlements over there . Who should n't even be there in the first place . A bunch of far-out Zionists or New York City . It 's no deal , Mr. President , no deal at all . I recommend we alert the Eighty-second Airborne and the divisions in Germany and hold the Sixth Fleet Marine transports in the eastern Mediterraneaninstead of sending them toward Libya with the carriers . If we 're going to land the Marines , it 'll be in Haifa , not in Tripoli . And I recommend State open very discreet communications with the Syrians . " Just a suggestion of a smile turned the edges of the General 's mouth . " I suspect they 'll he ready to offer us landing facilities in Damascus if we need them . " I he General 's right . " It was Tap Bennington . " The fact of the122matter is , those settlements over there are absolutely illegal . We 've opposed them . You 've opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and the Israelis wo n't get those people out of there , then we damn well better be ready to go in and get them out ourselves . " " Whatever we think about those settlements , " the President noted , " and you all know how I feel about them , forcing the Israelisout of them now would be yielding to Qaddafi 's blackmail . It would be showing the world that this kind of act pays . " " Mr. President , " Bennington answered , " that 's a very fine moral point , but I do n't think it 's going to cut much ice with those good folk up there in New York . " Eastman had followed the exchange in discreet silence . " One thing is clear , " he now interjected , " and that is , Israel is vitally concerned in this . The sooner we bring Mr. Begin into it , the bet-ter . " Just an intimation of distaste crossed the President 's composed features at the mention of the Israeli Prime Minister 's name . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much . How many hours had he been forced to listen to his interminablelectures on the history of the Jewish people , the constant , self-important references to the Bible ; to the Israeli 's infuriating habit of arguing forever over the most trivial legal point . God , he thought , dealing with Begin had forced him to draw on reserves of patience which he had never imagined he possessed . " You 're right . " He sighed . " Get Mr. Begin on the phone . " The early light burnished the Jerusalem limestone of the house at 3 Balfour Street to an amber glow . Just the suspicion of a breeze picked the tips of the Aleppo pines rising above the cement wall protecting the residence of the Prime Minister of Israel . Inside , in the somber study that adjoined the sitting room , a slight figure stared moodily out the French windows to the floweredpatio beyond . To his left , barely one hundred yards away , was the imposing roofline of the King David Hotel . His name would be forever associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commando of Menachem Begin 's Irgun Zvai Leumi had killed ninety people , devastated a British headquarters and earned him a place in his unborn nation 's history books. 121Behind Begin , on one of the bookshelves stacked with encyclopedias , was a photograph taken of himself in the disguise which had allowed him time and time again to slip through the streets of Tel Aviv under the noses of Britain 's soldiers : the flat black hat , black frock coat and straggly beard of a rabbi . He turned and walked slowly back to the desk at which he had taken the President 's phone call . He was dressed in a gray suit , a white shirt and a dark small-patterned tie , a reflection of a taste in clothes which , like so many other things , stamped him as a man apart in a nation in which ties were an anathema and baggy corduroyswere preferred to well-pressed trousers . Once again he reviewed the notes he had scribbled on a yellow legal pad during the President 's phone call , punctuating his study with sips of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had constituted his breakfast since his second heart attack five years ago . He uttered a silent prayer to the God of Israel . There was no question in Begin 's mind about the significance of the information the President had passed him : it representedthe most fundamental shift in power relationships in the Middle East in his lifetime . The American President would perceiveit , as he would have to , in terms of the horrible threat being posed to the people of New York . Begin 's duty was to perceive it in terms of the threat it posed to his people and their nation . It was mortal . A crisis was at hand and Begin well knew that , in that crisis , he could not count on the friendship of the President . He had long ago sensed the rising tide of the animosity the American bore him . For his part , Begin did not dislike the President ; rather , he mistrusted him , just as he mistrusted most non-Jews  --  and , indeed , a great many of his fellow Jews . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentality , a narrow , ingrown attitude ill fitting a world leader , an inability to perceive a problem in anything other than its Jewish dimension . That was the natural heritage of his formative years , his boyhood in the ghettos of Poland , his youth fighting as a Jewish partisan , his young manhood spent as an underground chieftain with a price on his head , struggling to drive the British from Palestine . One vision had driven him during those years , the vision of his tutor , Vladimir . lahotinsky , whose writings lined his study . It was of Fret/ . Israel , the Land of Israel : not the truncated little Israel that his foe , David lien ( ; union , had accepted like a erunih fromthe world 's table in 1947 , but the real land of Israel , the Biblical land God had promised his forebearers . Consolidating Israel 's claims to the land captured in 1967 , which he referred to as Judea and Samaria , and bringing his people peace : those had been the two fundamentally irreconcilable aims of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away this Decembermorning . The complex , painfully arrived-at Egyptian  --  Israeli peace settlement had proven to be a chimera . Its failure to come to grips with the Palestinian problem had left a raw and festering wound at the heart of the Middle East . Instead of enjoying the benefits of the peace they so desperately wanted , his countrymen were living the most painful hours of their existence . Inflation and the heaviest tax burden any people on the globe were forced to carry stifled their economic life . Immigration had dwindled to a trickle of the infirm and the elderly . Many more Jews left Israel each year than arrived . There seemed little promise left in the Promised Land .  - -  Most important , Israel 's enemies , determined to destroy a peace settlement they believed to be a fraud , were gathering once again . Iraq and Syria were united , the Palestinians resurgent . Behind them , fanatical and militant , was the new Leftist Islamic Republic in Iran with its vast arsenal of sophisticated American weaponry seized in the overthrow of the Shah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , was openly hostile . The oilproducingstates of the Persian Gulf , menaced by the Leftist tides to the north , no longer dared to counsel caution to their Arab brothers . The focal point on which all their ambitions converged was Jerusalemand the Land of Judea and Samaria . Qaddafi 's mad gesture seemed to Begin the inevitable culmination of the conflict that had opposed Arab and Jew for half a century . Outside , he heard the rasp of approaching motorcycles . A few seconds later there was a knock on his door . His wife entered the study and placed on his desk a white envelope with a red slash across one corner . It was sealed and bore the words " Sodi Beyoter  --  Ultra Confidential . " Prepared a few blocks away in an austere , harracklike building identified only by a number , 28 , and the sign " Center for Research and Policy Planning , " it contained the daily intelligence digest of the most important of Israel 's three intelligeneeservices , the Mossad . The Prime Minister opened the envelope and smoothed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted , Israel 's seismograph laboratorieshad detected a shock of 5.7 on the Richter scale . Its source had been established as the area of the Awbari Sand Sea in southwesternLibya , an area not noted for earthquakes . Reading the next paragraph , he started . At 7:31 , the report continued , Mossad 's Washington representative had spoken personallyto the head of the CIA . The CIA director had given him his personal assurance that the shock was an earthquake . Even in the most difficult hours of Israel 's relations with the United States , the bonds between the CIA and her intelligence apparatus had been warm and intimate . There was almost nothing the Israelis learned that was not immediately passed to Washington . And now , in a matter critical to Israel 's national existence , the Americans had deliberately , if perhaps only momentarily , lied to her . The implications of that were not lost on the Israeli Prime Minister . He looked at his wife . She knew nothing of the crisis . But she saw he had suddenly gone pale , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the matter ? " she asked . " This time , we are alone , " he gasped , as much to his own stunned self as to her . " Completely alone . " The chimes of St. John 's Monastery of the Cross were tolling nine , Jerusalem time , when Menachem Begin 's black Dodge slipped below the Knesset , Israel 's Parliament , and up to the unattractive , functional building that housed the center of the nation 's government . A quartet of burly young men leaped out , each clutchingin his left hand a black leather attache case . Dressed in somethingother than their blue jeans and leather jackets , they might have been stockbrokers or a group of aggressive young salesmen rushing into company headquarters with their latest orders . Instead those cases contained the tools of their calling as the Prime Minister'sbodyguards , an Uzi submachine gun , three extra magazines of 9mm. ammunition , a Colt .45 and a walkie-talkie . A kw minutes later , Begin took his place at the center of the oval table at which his Cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the table had even the faintest intimation of the nature of the emergency that had brought them there . Begin hadt:hconfided in no one . For a moment his regard swept the room , his dark eyes rendered outsized by the glasses he wore to correct his astigmatic vision . Carefully choosing his words , he began . " Gentlemen , we are facing the gravest crisis in our history . " With the phenomenal memory for which he was noted , he recollectedevery detail of his conversation with the President . Nothing Begin could have told his ministers , no revelation he might have made , could have horrified them more than his words . For fifteen years their nation 's survival had reposed on two strategicpillars , the support of the United States and the knowledge that in the ultimate crisis Israel alone in the Middle East possessed atomic weapons . Now the image of a mushroom cloud rising above the Libyan desert had destroyed the strategic basis of their state . " We have no choice ! " The words thundered through the stricken silence left by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a heavy fist smashing onto the ministerial table . They came from a barrelchestedman in an old sweater and open shirt , his suntanned face setting off a full head of pure white hair . " We We ca n't live with a madman pointing a thermonuclear gun at our heads . " Benny Ranan was one of the five authentic military heroes in the room , a former paratroop general who 'd jumped at the head of his troops in the 1973 war in the spectacular transcanal operation which had paved the way for Arik Sharon 's triumphant encirclementof Egypt 's Third Army . As Minister of Construction , or " Minister of Bulldozers " as he was referred to , he was one of the most ardent supporters of the program to throw up new Israeli settlements on the land Begin called Judea and Samaria . He rose and strode around the table with the swaying gait his paratroopers loved to mimic . His destination was the mural covering one wall of the room , a photograph of the Middle East taken by Walter Schirra from his Apollo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulnerability of their nation than that kaleidoscopeof blues , whites and blacks , its vista sweeping from the Red to the Black Sea , from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf . Israel was just a sliver in its immensity , a strip of land clinging precariously to one edge of the photo . Ranan gazed at it dramatically . " What this does is change totally127the conditions of our existence . All Qaddafi has to do to destroy us is drop a bomb here  --  " Ranan 's thick forefinger thumped the map in the vicinity of Tel Aviv  --  " and here  --  and here . Three bombs and this nation will cease to exist . " He turned back to his fellow ministers . The booming paradegroundvoice dropped in register to a hoarse whisper . " What would our life be worth here knowing that at any second , any minute , any hour , a fanatic who 's been screaming for our blood for years can incinerate us instantly ? I could n't live like that . Could any of you ? Could anybody ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the men in the room . " Forty centuries of history has one lesson for us . We Jews must resist any threat to our existence with all our strength . We have to destroy him , gentlemen . Right now . Before the sun is high . " Ranan placed his forearms on the table so that his heavy trunk leaned forward and the lingering smell of the garlic and cheese of his breakfast hung on the air . " And we will tell the Americans what we intend to do once we 've done it . " Again , quiet muffled the room . The Deputy Prime Minister struck a match and thoughtfully lit his pipe . Yigal Yadin 's bushy moustache and his bald head were as much a part of Israel 's politicalscene as Ranan 's bulky figure . He was an archaeologist , a humanistic warrior who was the architect of Israel 's victory in the first war she had had to fight with her Arab neighbors , in 1948 . " For the moment , Benny , " he noted , " the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're in New York . " " That does n't matter . What matters is destroying Qaddafi before he can react . The Americans will thank us for doing it . " " And suppose Qaddafi still manages to detonate that bomb and destroy New York ? How much gratitude do you suppose that will inspire in the Americans ? " Ranan sighed . " That would be a tragedy . An appalling , ghastly tragedy . But it 's a risk we 're forced to take . What would be a greater tragedy  --  the destruction of New York or the destruction of our nation ? " " For whom , Benny ? " Yadin asked . " Us or the Americans ? " " There are three million Jews in New York , " noted Rabbi Yehuda()rent , leader of the religious party that was a part of Begin 's ruling coalition , more than there are here . " r28 " This is where they belong . " Ranan shook his head . " What 's at stake here is more important than any number of Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jewish people . If we disappear , the Jewish people will cease to exist as a people . We 'll condemn our seed to another two thousand years in the wilderness , in the ghettos , in dispersion and hate . " " Benny , " the Prime Minister noted , " I must remind you the Americans have asked us to avoid taking any unilateral action against Qaddafi . " " The Americans ? " Ranan gave a growling , scornful laugh . " Let me tell you something , the Americans are going to sell us out . That 's what they 're going to do . " His hand waved toward a bank of black telephones in one corner of the room . " They 're on the phone trying to talk to Qaddafi right now . Dealing away our land , our people , behind our backs . " " And suppose we do negotiate over those settlements . " Those words from the mouth of General Yusi Avidar , head of Shimbet , Israel 's military intelligence agency , stunned the room . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arab Legion in the crucial battle for the West Bank . " Giving them up wo n't mean the end of Israel . Most of the people in this country did n't want them there in the first place . " " What 's at stake is not those settlements . " Ranan 's answering voice was deep and controlled . " Or New York . It 's whether this nation can exist beside a Muammar Qaddafi armed with thermonuclearweapons . I say it can not . " " And for that you 're ready to run the risk of seeing five million innocent Americans slaughtered , of making enemies of the one people whose support and help we need ? " " I am . " " You 're mad . " Avidar sighed . " It 's insane . It 's this damnable , sick Massada complex driving us to destruction and suicide again . " Ranan was totally composed . " Every minute we waste talking brings us closer to our own destruction . We have to act right now , before the world can organize to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no West Bank , no Jerusalem , Yassir Arafat and his thugs on our doorstep , our hands tied behind our backs by the Americans , and Qaddafiposed to slaughter us . We will have no more will or reason to exist . " I29Menachem Begin had followed the argument without intervening , anxious to let every opinion enter into the debate . Now , softly , he spoke to his Defense Minister . " Does this nation have any military option to stop Qaddafi other than an all-out preemptive nuclear attack on Libya ? " The burly former fighter pilot who was the architect of Israel 's Air Force slowly , despairingly almost , moved his head from side to side . " I can see none . We have no resources to mount and sustain an attack across hundreds of miles of open water . " Begin glanced at his hands , folded on the table before him . " I have lived through one holocaust . I can not live under the threat of another . I believe we have no choice . I pray God the bomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God ! " General Avidar gasped . " We wo n't have a friend left in the world . " Begin 's face was set in a tragic , melancholy mask . " We have no friends now . We never have . From Pharaoh to Hitler we have been a people condemned by God and history to dwell alone . " He called for a vote . Scanning the raised hands , he remembered the May afternoon in 1948 when the leaders of the Jewish people had decided to proclaim their state  --  by just one vote . That was the margin before him  --  one vote . He turned to General Dorit . " Destroy Libya , " he ordered . No people in the world were better trained or better equipped to move fast in a crisis than the Israelis . Speed of reaction was a life-or-death reflex in a nation whose principal city could count on only two minutes ' warning of an enemy attack from its northern borders , five minutes ' from the south . As a result , the Israelis possessed probably the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this December morning the speed with which it went into action was dazzling . As soon as the Cabinet 's decision was taken , General Dorit got up and went to a special telephone in the anteroom . That phone gave him a direct link to " The Hole , " Israel 's underground command post 16o feet below her Pentagon at Hakyria between Tel Aviv 's Kaplan and Leonardo da Vinci Streets . " I'he walls of Jericho , " he said to the major sitting at the commandconsole in " The Hole . " His code phrase activated the corn-lc ) mand net which linked every one of Israel 's twenty-seven senior military officers day and night . Whether they were jogging along the Tel Aviv waterfront , hoeing their garden , making love to a wife or a girl friend , or simply going to the toilet , each of those twentysevenmen was required to have a telephone or an **26;8117;TOOLONG short-wave , two-way radio transmitter within an arm 's length of his person at all times . They were all assigned code names that were changed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hakyria , the new names being selected at random from an assigned category such-as flowers or fruits . Dorit ran out of the government headquarters , toward one of the two completely duplicated communications trucks which always traveled with his gray Plymouth . By the time he had settled into its seat , all twenty-six of his key subordinates were on line , standing by for his orders . Exactly three minutes had elapsed since MenachemBegin had given the order to destroy Libya . In " The Hole , " an Israeli female soldier , her khaki miniskirt clinging to her buttocks , unlocked the safe next to the command console . Inside were banks of envelopes , two for every potential enemy Israel possessed . The Israelis well knew there would be no time for planning once a crisis started , and those envelopes containedalternative sets of plans for a nuclear assault on any nation apt to menace her existence . Option A was designed to maximize the effect of the strike on the countries ' population centers , Option B to maximize the effects on military targets . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and set them on the commandconsole before the major who coordinated communications . He quickly reviewed them by radio with Dorit . Everything the commander needed to know was contained in those envelopes : the radar frequencies ; strike times calculated down to the last second ; a complete description of Libya 's radar and aircraft defenses ; the best attack routes to each target ; up-to-date aerial-reconnaissance photographs . In addition , duplicates of those envelopes were on file at the Israeli air bases where the pilots who would have to execute the plans they contained waited . Dorit ordered Option B prepared . It would pose some spectacularproblems : the commanding general wanted all targets struck simultaneously to heighten surprise . Because of the length of 1 , ibya 's coastline , the planes hitting Tripoli would have to cover 1,250 miles ; those striking the eastern borders , half that distance. t3 ' As Libya was beyond the range of Israel 's Jericho B rockets designed to carry nuclear warheads six hundred miles , the strike would have to be delivered by her fleet of F-4 Phantom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfriendly radar screens until the Phantoms were over their targets . Libya 's radar was not a serious problem . But the radars of the U.S. Sixth Fleet steaming west from Crete were . Dorit ordered Ben-Gurion Airport to prepareHassida for takeoff . " Hassida , " Hebrew for " stork , " was the code word for a Boeing 707 . From the outside , it resembled a jet of Israel 's national airline , El Al . The resemblance ended at the cabin door . Inside was a forest of electronic equipment . Israel had pioneered the techniques of " masking " an aircraft 's flight pattern from enemy radar with the material the plane contained . It was thanks to such Israeli skills that the planes bearing Egypt 's commando assault team had been able to land at Nicosia airport undetected by Cypriot radar during their ill-fated effort to rescue a group of hostages held by Palestinian gunmen . In flight , that 707 would create a series of electronic " tunnels " through which the attacking Phantoms would streak , undetected , to their targets . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latrum , halfway to Tel Aviv , he had finished . In less than twenty minutes , enveloped by the olive groves , the ageless hills of Judea , he had planned the first preemptive nuclear attack in history . One task remained : choosing a code name for the strike . The major manning the command console proposed one . Dorit acceptedit immediately . It was " Operation Maspha , " for the Biblical site where the thunder of Yahweh had routed the Philistines . On every side the low and level sands stretched far away . Only the black stain of a herd of goats , the bleached white stone of a nomad 's tomb or the bat-wing profile of a Bedouin 's tent intruded on the endless ochre seas . Once the caravans of antiquity had passed by here ; so , too , probably had the Children of Israel strugglinghomeward from their Egyptian exile . And here , under those Negev wastes , in three widely separated underground passageways , the children of modern Israel had stored for more than a decade the terrible weapons that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' atomic bombs. 1 ; 2Instants after General Dorit 's first alert had reached " The Hole , " a series of red lights had erupted in a coded burst on the control panel of each tunnel , activating at the same time the wail of a klaxon siren . At the sound , a score of technicians in each tunnel leaped from desks , bunks and backgammon boards and raced down the brightly lit corridors to the nuclear vaults . On one side of each tunnel , in airless containers , were shiny silver balls not much larger than the grapefruits grown in the orchards of the kibbutzim a few miles away . They were the plutonium cores of Israel 's latest generation of nuclear weapons . As one team removed them from the containers , another was wheeling in the high-explosive cladding , the jacket into which each was designed to fit . Their separation was a strategem . Since an atomic bomb existed only when these two halves were assembled , Israel had always been able to maintain publicly that she had not introduced nuclear weapons into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that employed by the aircraft carriers of the U.S. Seventh Fleet whenever they visited Japanese ports . Assembling them was a precise , delicate process , but those technicians spent hours every month rehearsing it until , like infantry soldiers breaking down and reassemblinga rifle , they could do it blindfolded . Only once before had those bombs been assembled with the terrible knowledge that they might have to be used . It was in the predawn hours of October 9 , 1973 , barely seventy-two hours after the outbreak of the 1973 war . Earlier that night , the Syrians had pierced the last Israeli defenses standing in their path on the northernfront . The heartland of Israel , the rich plains of Galilee , lay exposed and undefended before their columns . Moshe Dayan , in a state of extreme nervous agitation , had warned Golda Meir with an ancient Hebrew phrase that their nation faced a catastrophe comparableto the destruction of ancient Israel 's Second Temple by Rome 's rampaging legions . Dismayed , dangerously close to suicide , she had responded with the order she had prayed she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel 's nuclear weapons for use against her enemies . The Syrians did not attack , however , and the crisis passed , but not before the Soviets had rushed a shipload of nuclear warheads from their Black Sea naval base of Nikolaev to Alexandria to be incorporatedinto their Scud missiles already in Egypt . CIA gamma-ray133detectors hidden along the Bosporus picked them up as they transitedthe waterway . That knowledge , in turn , led to Richard Nixon 's global alert of U.S. forces . Now , in their brilliantly illuminated tunnels , Israel 's technicians prepared those bombs once again . In the control room of each tunnel , a high-speed Teleprinter gave the setting for each bomb 's pressure detonator , fixing a few for ground-level burst , ordering the majority primed to explode at medium or high altitude to maximizetheir destructive radius . As each was readied it was fitted into a special trolley designed to carry four fully armed bombs . The first trolleys were rolling down the corridors just eight minutes and forty-three seconds after the klaxon 's first warning wail . The atomic bombs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as old as the state of Israel itself . The man who had originally proposed it was Chaim Weizmann , Israel 's first President and a brilliant scientist whose work in naval gunpowder for the British in 1914 had helped open Palestine for Jewish immigration with the Balfour Declaration . Over the objections of a number of his colleagues , David BenGurion , the warrior-philosopher who presided over the state in its formative years , had committed Israel to the nuclear program in the early 195os . Israel 's first allies in the search were the French , embarked in defiance of their Anglo-American allies on a nuclear-arms program of their own . Cut off from access to computer technology by the Americans , the French turned to the minds of the Weizmann Instituteoutside Tel Aviv for help in the interminable calculations the bomb project required . The Israelis also introduced the French to a technique they had developed to produce heavy water . In return , the French gave the Israelis access to their program and let them participate in the Sahara tests of their first bomb design , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . Finally , in late 19S7 , the French agreed to sell her an experimental reactor fueled with natural uranium , a reactor that both nations ' scientists knew could one day be used to produce weapons-grade plutonium . Ben-Gurion himself chose the site for his atomic installation , a desolate strip of desert easily isolated and protected twenty miles ; 4south of his home kibbutz of Sde Boker . It was called Dimona , the name of a Biblical town that had existed there in the time of the Nabataeans . When Israeli engineers moved in to prepare the center , the government decided to conceal its real purpose by labeling it a textile plant . Thereafter , as the reactor 's dome gradually began to rise above the desert floor , it was referred to by Israeli cognoscentias " Ben-Gurion 's pants factory . " A year later , the arrival of Charles de Gaulle in power in France in May 1958 put an abrupt halt to Franco-Israeli nuclear cooperation . For the nationalist de Gaulle , France 's nuclear program was no one 's business but France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build a bomb and , until Dimona was ready , nothing to build it with . She found what she needed in the unlikeliest of locations , a shabby factory complex on the outskirts of Apollo , Pennsylvania , thirty-five miles northeast of Pittsburghon Route 66 . There the Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation ( NUMEC )  --  founded in 1957 by Dr. Zalman Shapiro  --  made nuclear fuel and recovered highly enriched uranium from scraps of leftover fuel from the U.S. nuclear-submarine program . Between 196o and 1967 an unbelievable 572 pounds of highly enriched , weapons-grade uranium disappeared from NUMEC . Well over half of it , the CIA later discovered , at least enough for a score of bombs . wound up in the Negev . That NUMEC uranium fueled Israel 's first generation of atomic bombs . The second generation was made from plutonium separatedout of the burnt fuel of the Dimona reactor . Those efforts had left Israel , by the end of the seventies , far more than just the seventh nuclear power on the globe . The bombs rising out of their desert hiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence agencies rated as good as England 's and superior to China 's . " Stop here . I want to get some cigarettes . " Yusi Avidar , the director of military intelligence , waved his driver to a halt on Jerusalem 's Jaffa Road . He got out and walked to the tobacco shop just around the corner , where he bought a pack of Europa cigarettes . When he came out , instead of returning to his car , he drifted up the street to the public telephone booth thirty yards away . No one135recognized him there , fumbling through his address book for a telephone number . No one ever recognized Israeli intelligence directors ; their faces and functions were carefully concealed from the public . Avidar was not in fact looking for a number ; he knew by heart the number he was thinking of calling . His hand trembled as he lit one of the cigarettes he had just bought . His face paled , and , standing there , pretending to study his address book , he felt his knees shake . His hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It stopped halfway . He turned to leave the booth , then stopped again . Swiftly , in one continuous movement designed almost to reach its culmination before any other impulse could stop him , he dropped the coin into the slot and dialed the number . Forty miles away on the Tel Aviv sea front , the telephone rang in the office of the second political counselor of the U.S. Embassy . Three blasts of a siren almost shook the half-dozen young men out of the leather easy chairs in which they sprawled watching closed-circuit television . Three blasts was the signal for an air-to-ground mission for those pilots of the Israeli Air Force ; two would have signaled an air-to-air alert . Grabbing their helmets and orange life jackets , they ran out of their ready room , across a graveled courtyard to the one-story bungalow from which their squadron was commanded . As they did , the first assembled nuclear bombs were already being fitted into their Phantom jets hidden in concrete abutments slotted into the desert floor so carefully they were practically invisible . The pre-attack briefing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would employ in an emergency , the codes they would have to follow with total precision to be sure their assault was perfectly coordinated . As one of the senior airmen in Israel , the squadron commander , Lieutenant Colonel Giora Lascov , was assigned to the huge Uba bin Nafi Air Base , formerly the U.S. Air Force 's Wheelus Base outside Tripoli , as his target . Like three quarters of Israel 's pilots , the thirty-five-year-old Lascov was a kihhutznik . In his fifteen years as a member of the elite of Israel 's armed forces , he had fought in two wars and accumulatedover three thousand hours of flight time . So highly trained , so programmed , was he to respond to a crisis that the suddenrevelation that this was not an exercise and that he would , in a very brief time , be dropping a twenty-kiloton nuclear bomb on an enemy target barely jarred his composure . Because they had the greatest distance to cover , he and his wing man had the first launch . As he rose to head to the jeep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Phantom , the full enormity of what he was about to do struck Lascov . He turned to look back at the young pilots of his squadron . Their faces reflected the horror that had suddenly engulfed him . He stood there trying to find in his mind some words , some phrase , to leave his men . Then he understood that there were no words to fit so terrible a moment . Silently , Lascov turned to his jeep . Seconds later , he was racing toward his Phantom . It was 9:52 . Exactly thirty-four minutes had elapsed since General Dorit had stepped out of the Cabinet Room and picked up the phone linking him to " The Hole . " Menachem Begin removed his steel-rimmed glasses . He lowered his head into the cradle of his left hand , slowly massaging his bushy eyebrows with his thumb and middle finger . There was a world of agony in that simple gesture , the reflection of a weariness so crushing that Israel 's Prime Minister felt numb . He looked at the terse communication on the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered . Since 1973 , every detail of Israel 's nuclear strategy had been reviewed , pondered again and again , to be sure that no revealing detail of a coming attack could he picked up by a passing satellite , that no compromising communicationcould be intercepted by electronic surveillance . Yet , two minutes ago , he had received a phone call from the French ambassador . His voice hesitant with concern , the Frenchman had relayed the threat from the Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union : if Israel went through with her nuclear strike against Libya , Soviet rockets would instantly annihilate their nation . Were the Soviets bluffing ? Were they just rattling their rockets the way Khrushchev had done at Suez ? Did he have the right to risk the nation 's existence on the possibility that they were ? Begin glanced at his watch . In twelve minutes the Phantoms would he arriving on target . No time to reconvene the Cabinet . The decision was his , and his alone . He got up and walked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman , " as he was often described , studied the ageless sweep of the Judean hills , the monuments of modern Israel , the Knesset , the Hebrew University , the Israel Museum sparkling in the sunshine . On a rise just beyond his line of vision was the one which meant more to Begin than any of the others , the white marble canopy of a " Tent of Remembrance " under which burned an eternal flame in memory of the six million victims of the holocaust  --  and most of his own family . Begin had sworn on the altar of those six million dead that never again would his people live another holocaust . Would they if he went through with this ? The Soviet threat was so devastatingly simple and direct . Yet Ranan was right . How could Israel exist constantly menaced with destruction at Qaddafi 's hands ? Everything had depended on speed , on annihilating Libya and explaining why afterward . In the terrible chess game of global terror , there was only one move left that could check the Russians now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their counterthreatmight stay the Russians ' hand . But , Begin asked himself , were the Americans going to risk that when they discovered he had acted on his own , that he had not hesitated to imperil the city of New York to save his nation ? In a flash , Begin understood . The Russians had n't found out . No one had . The Americans had n't trusted them . They had realized that their own threat might n't be enough to stay Israel 's hand , to freeze her in position while they handled the crisis , so they had turned to the Soviets . A phrase from Shakespeare 's Henry VIII , " naked to mine enemies , " flashed through his mind . That was Israel now , naked and vulnerable . He stared at his telephone . He had only to wait for it to ring now , for the start of the terrible pressures he knew would soon be on him , to abandon a dream , to break his nation 's will , to dissemble its capital . Shrunken and suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Far below his streaking Phantom , Lieutenant Colonel Lascov could see the blue waters of the Mediterranean . His eyes swept incessantly over his instrument panel , looking for any flaw13in the electronically controlled flight program hurling him toward the Libyan coast at almost twice the speed of sound . On his radar screen , he could already discern the outlines of the African shore . In nine minutes he would be climbing into the Tripolitan sky to prepare his bombing run . Suddenly , a sharp buzz rose in his earphones . " Shadrock . Shadrock . Shadrock . " Lascov tensed . Then , frantically , he began fingeringhis controls , swinging his plane in a 18o-degree arc . The coastline of Africa faded from his radar screen . Operation Maspha had been stood down .
