In the lame-duck days of the Roman Empire , barbarian tribes frequently jostled one another as they trundled across the Eurasian landmass . Sometimes the stronger would displace the weaker , sometimes they would wage war among themselves , and occasionally there was a process of cooperation and mutual assimilation . And so it has been with the various factions that seek to control the turf of America 's political parties . New tribes wander in and displace older ones , struggling every now and then to capture the soul of their party . Only rarely does a leader come along who can smother factional rivalries and give definition to a party through the force of his own presence . <P> Franklin Roosevelt was such a leader , forging the coalition that became the modern Democratic Party . Ronald Reagan is another . For almost eight years , he has defined both parties : a disparate array of Republicans became Reaganauts all , and true Democrats of various stripes united as resisters of the revolution . <P> Now both parties must find their post-Reagan souls . The task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last week the foolish notion that this could largely be sorted out by 400,000 voters in Iowa and New Hampshire was dispelled . As both parties head South , it seems likely that their infighting will continue until voters in the 48 other states get their say . <P> The gauzy morning-in-America aura of the Reagan regime has been characterized by a willful failure to face fiscal realities . The resulting budget and trade deficits constrict the ideas and visions that candidates might see fit to offer . Though the nation knows in its gut that it is time to move beyond the feel-good pap that Reagan offered , it is not ready to bestow popularity on those who call for realistic prescriptions . Last week Bruce Babbitt discovered that sad truth . So did Robert Dole , whose sin was taking the sensible position that he would not rule out all tax increases . <P> Reagan 's fade from the landscape he once dominated reveals the factionalism that riddles both parties . It is reflected in what has become the strange and somewhat tribal rallying cry inscribed on the banners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For some , the message is mainly regional : Michael Dukakis grandly quaffing a mug of clam chowder upon landing in New Hampshire from Iowa , as he tried to overcome the aloof smugness that seems plastered to his face ; Albert Gore whistling Dixie while he waited for Super Tuesday . <P> But when Dole said that Iowa voters should " think of Bob Dole as one of us , " he was referring not just to his regional proximity but to the hardscrabble heritage he shares with many of them . It was a matter of class , of culture , of sects , of tribes . The phrase revealed the bitter resentments against people like George Bush that seem to reverberate in Dole 's dark inner soul . Bush , the quasi-New Englander , tried to usurp the " I 'm one of you " line when his campaign moved to New Hampshire . But from his mouth it sounded a bit silly ; one thing Bush is not , no matter how many forklift trucks he is photographed driving , is a man of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
