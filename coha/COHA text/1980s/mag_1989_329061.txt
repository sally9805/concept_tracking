Environmentalists and governments everywhere agree that something must be done to halt the widespread use of chloro-fluorocarbons ( CFCs ) and other substances that are destroying the earth 's protective ozone layer  --  and just about everybody agrees that nobody is doing enough . Last week the Southern California city of Irvine ( pop . 110,000 ) did more than most . <P> By a vote of 4 to 1 , the city council passed an ordinance prohibiting the manufacture , sale and use of virtually all ozone-depleting chemicals . Banned are plastic food packagings made with CFCs , certain types of building insulation and some solvents widely used for cleaning printed circuit boards in personal computers . Most consumer spray-can products are permitted ; the majority of these are no longer propelled with CFCs . Refrigerators and automobile air conditioners are excluded , since no readily available substitute exists for the hazardous compounds they use . <P> Irvine 's ordinance is a small but significant step . Of the city 's 5,000 businesses , about 500 electronics , insulation and fast-food packaging companies will be affected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . of ozone-depleting compounds annually  --  one five-thousandth of the entire amount of such chemicals used worldwide every year .
