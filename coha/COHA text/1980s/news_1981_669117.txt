Just when it seemed we were lost forever in a second childhood , with nobody but Superman and the Raiders of the Lost Ark for company , Hollywood is showering us with the likes of ' ' Reds ' ' and ' ' Rollover ' ' and ' ' Ragtime . ' ' None are masterpieces , to be sure , and all show signs of lingering adolescence , such as ostentatious four-letter words that signal eager trendiness rather than seasoned maturity . But all are serious even when they fall down on the job , and all are helped by serious performers who know how to make the most of their material . Just what we needed to balance off the hogwash that has dominated the last couple of years. // Grabbing the most newspaper space is ' ' Reds , ' ' the massive Warren Beatty epic about John Reed , the author and activist , an early Communist who helped out with the Soviet Revolution and became the only American to receive burial in the Kremlin . According to Hollywood scuttlebutt , Beatty has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it shows in the monumental effort he has put into the film , which carries his name as director , producer , co-writer , and star . Quite a list of credits , especially since this is no quick docudrama , but rather a sweeping investigation - 31/2 hours ' worth , including intermission - into the life and loves of a very complicated man in a very complicated time. // Beatty deserves nothing but praise for the attempt . He has boldly chosen a subject that is not fashionable just now , and a main character who is unknown to most moviegoers . Furthermore , he has structured the film brilliantly , intercutting dramatic scenes with real-life reminiscences by eyewitnesses of the period , from Will Durant and Roger Baldwin to Henry Miller and George Jessell . These interjections underscore the importance of Reed and the impact of his cause and his period . And they are hugely entertaining , to boot. // Unfortunately , the filmmaker has fared less well with other aspects of the movie . The biggest problems are in the first half , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radical Louise Bryant , who became his wife and stayed essentially loyal to him despite frequent separations caused by work , temperament , and the vicissitudes of fighting the good fight . However their relationship may have fared in life , it looks terribly hokey on screen , where Beatty treats it as a series of trite domestic dilemmas , hackneyed love-hate diatribes , and hazy sex scenes . It seems downright ornery to subordinate the movie ' s mighty political themes - the American socialist movement , the Russian Revolution , et al. - to a love story that ' s so dull and ordinary . Maybe it takes a Tolstoy to integrate the storm of history and the raindrop of a love affair into one precisely balanced pattern . Beatty doesn ' t have the knack. // The second half is more successful , as Beatty gets bolder with his material and bothers less with everyday romance . Here the movie proceeds in great jumps from one major event to the next , tossing continuity to the winds and reveling in energy for its own sake . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , is an embarrassing cliche - but you hardly have time to notice them as the film barrels along at a tremendous clip . ' ' Reds ' ' becomes fun at this point , but for many viewers it may be too late. // The performances are uneven . Beatty is attractive , though rarely inspired , as the main character . Diane Keaton is weak as his wife , though this suits the vacillating Bryant to a point . Jack Nicholson has the best lines as their pal Eugene O ' Neill - or maybe it ' s just the way Nicholson drawls them - and Maureen Stapleton is surprisingly apt as the anarchist Emma Goldman , who shows up in ' ' Reds ' ' after being excised from the shooting script of ' ' Ragtime . ' ' Edward Herrmann and Paul Sorvino make less than their usual impressions , but novelist Jerzy Kosinski makes a promising screen debut as a mover and shaker of the Bolshevik brood . <> <> ' Rollover ' // Another new drama , ' ' Rollover , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' in dealing with unconventional and provocative subject matter . How often has the fragility of the world financial scene been the springboard for a Hollywood movie ? // Oh , it ' s genuine Hollywood , all right . There ' s a murder scheme , a love story , and a bit of murkily photographed sex . But to the credit of director Alan J. Pakula and his fellow filmmakers , these obligatory items remain secondary to the main action , which is handled in a no-nonsense style that ' s as crisp as it is complicated . It ' s a businesslike movie about business , with just two major flaws to undermine its appeal : a limp performance by Kris Kristofferson , who looks woefully out of place as a Wall Street wheeler-dealer , and a finale in which the material goes berserk ruining the last ten minutes with a queasy mixture of sentiment and apocalypse. // The busy Jane Fonda ( also starring in the hit ' ' On Golden Pond ' ' ) plays a former actress who becomes head of a corporation after her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an ambitious investment banker with a tempting deal . Gradually , they fall in love . And just as gradually , they discover that a certain magnate ( played by Hume Cronyn , superb as always ) is carrying on a nasty monetary scam right under their noses . In fact , it ' s such a monumental piece of skulduggery that it could bring the rich Arab world and the shaky West into a disastrous confrontation and knock over the whole teetering tower of international finance. // While the story has moments of sheer melodrama , Pakula keeps it under strict control most of the time , rattling off the yarn with such vigor that it ' s easy to forget how boring money usually is as a fictional subject . The film has a sharp visual style , too , using architecture more expressively than any Hollywood picture in a long while. // The screenplay is fanatical in its attention to detail and its insistence on capturing the cadences of the financial world . The tycoons talk like tycoons , just as the scientists in ' ' Altered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their audience or even slowing down so we can figure out what they ' re saying . It ' s a bit confusing some of the time , but it ' s refreshing to be kept on your toes for a change. // With so much going for ' ' Rollover , ' ' it ' s a pity Pakula didn ' t know how to end it . Unlike most movies , this one almost follows its ideas to their logical conclusions , not copping out . Though the climax is commendably forthright , however , the filmmakers fail to make it an integral part of their story . The last 15 minutes seem tacked on , cursory , and unconvincing. // What ' s worse , there ' s a sort of coda that sours the whole taste of the film with a blatantly false intrusion of artifice , elitism , and ' ' love conquers all ' ' mendacity . It ' s the kind of contrived ' ' happy ending ' ' that has less to do with art than with the sorriest side of capitalism - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very end so they ' ll leave with a smile and tell their friends to buy tickets. // True , that ' s standard studio practice . But it ' s disappointing in a movie that purports to believe people are more important than money , and comes so close to blowing the whistle on cynical manipulation in the guise of corporate creativity . Like the serious-minded ' ' Reds , ' ' the thoughtful ' ' Rollover ' ' is almost an important statement on a major theme . But decades of dubious Hollywood habits are hard for filmmakers - even ambitious ones - to overcome . These brave new pictures come close to their goals , but fall just a little bit short. // //
