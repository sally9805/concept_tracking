New health fears often bring windfall business , as the manufacturers of sun block and condoms can attest . This season the booming product is insect repellent . The near hysteria over tick-borne Lyme disease , along with a proliferation of other buzzing pests because of wet weather , has sent the sales of bug spray and lotion rising at double-digit rates . <P> Besides boosting products ranging from S.C . Johnson 's best-selling OFF ! to New Hampshire-made Ben 's 100 lotion , the mania has also encouraged new entries . Florida-based Eclipse Laboratories seized upon the potential profits by introducing Tick Garde . The bug spray contains DEET , or diethylmetatoluamide , the same active ingredient found in many standard repellents , but the product 's name appeals directly to the latest fears . The 6-oz. blue-and-white-colored cans cost $7.95 , almost double the price of other sprays ; yet in just a little over three months consumers have snapped up more than 500,000 of them .                    @
