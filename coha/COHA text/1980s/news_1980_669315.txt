In fact , Fields could visit Philadelphia **28;6129; this <> summer , he would have to choose some other city to be the butt of his jokes . The moldy one-liners such as " I spent a week in Philadelphia the other night " are no longer apt. // Philadelphia , once the political and cultural capital of the American colonies , has dusted off its best-known historic corners and salvaged those lesser known from the wrecker ' s ball . Around them all is a flowering of modern sculpture , gourmet restaurants , chic shops , lush green spaces , and urban ambiance that is embellishing the city with recaptured glory. // Part of the sprucing up is a direct result of the bicentennial celebration , which prompted city officials and private citizens to make the city more attractive for the hordes of tourists that were expected to come and see where the nation ' s birthday actually occurred . Tourists came , but not exactly in the hordes that had been anticipated. // " The bicentennial was a big disappointment for Philadelphia , " observes one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People overlooked us for New York and Boston , and we just didn ' t get much business . But now things have really turned around to the point were the ' 80s just might be our decade . " Tourism in Philadelphia , once all but limited to quickie tours of Independence Hall and a glance at the crack in the Liberty Bell , is now an $800 million a year business. // What may strike the newcomer , first , is that sculpture is everywhere . Out along East River Drive , adorning the banks of the Schuylkill River like so many rosettes on an already delectable cake , are artworks ranging from Frederic Remington ' s rustic " Cowboy " to Carl Milles ' s exquisite and modern " Playing Angles . " As one approaches the city center , the striking shapes become all the more apparent ; Claes Oldenburg ' s " Clothespin " in Centre Square , a 45-foot whimsical steel statue to just what its name suggests is perhaps the best known and certainly the most controversial. // Not much of this art proliferation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1959 when the Redevelopment Authority approved a resolution that 1 percent of any money spent on redevelopment in the city must go toward embellishing the projects with artwork . Since then close to 400 works  --  sculpture , bas relief , mosaics , frescoes , murals , stained glass , and fountains  --  have gone up throughout the city. // In view of this , it is appropriate that the splendid neoclassical Philadelphia Museum of Art presides over the city from its highest hill . If the massive , golden structure , that looks somewhat like a scene from " The Last Days of Pompei , " seems familiar at first glance , at first glance , it may because it ' s where Sylvester Stallone ran up the steps during the movie " Rocky. " // The museum ' s impressive holdings are well worth many visits . But if you have only time for one , try the American Wing , which exhibits paintings and furniture by Philadelphia artists and craftsmen. // The site of the musuem is where William Penn had longed to build his home . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate he left behind  --  the urban planning he instituted for Philadelphia in the late 17th century is still very much in evidence. // Penn ' s concept of Philadelphia as a " greene Countrie Towne " is perhaps best appreciated while touring the lush 8 , 000 acres of Fairmount Park . During spring and summer it is possible to catch a green and red trolley and take a 17-mile ride around the park , stopping at cultural , historical , and recreational attractions along the way . Among those attractions are the 42-acre Zoological Gardens ( the nation ' s oldest ) , Auguste Rodin ' s famous statue of " The Thinker , " and Robin Hood Dell West where the Philadelphia Orchestra gives concerts during June and July . The park also boasts what may be the nation ' s most elegant youth hostel , Chamounix , a federal-style mansion built in 1800 that is the Philadelphia headquarters for the American Youth Hostels. // In the 18th century a number of wealthy Philadelphians built their homes in Fairmount Park , primarily as summer retreats . Eight beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the **28;6159; piece de resistance <> is Mount Pleasant , an elegant gray and white Georgian manor that embodies the best of Philadelphia craftsmanship . Among its famous owners was Benedict Arnold , who bought it for his bride , Peggy Shippen . Due to his subsequent conviction of treason , the couple was never able to move in. // Although the park is a world in itself , there ' s a good deal of history and beauty to be enjoyed in Philadelphia ' s " Center City " as well . Here the downtown business district , Independence Park , and neighborhoods like Society Hill and Queen Village have all benefitted from recent renovation efforts. // Perhaps the most dramatic example is one of the city ' s grand old hotels , the Bellevue-Stratford , which was already in a state of decline in 1976 when an outbreak of the so-called Legionnaire ' s disease focused attention on it . It closed in November 1976 , was then purchased by the Fairmont Hotels group , which reopened it last September after a $22 million restoration project . Now called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columns , decorated plaster ceilings , and stained glass skylights restored to their 1904 glory . It has had no trouble garnering a large share of the city ' s newly burgeoning convention and tourist trade. // Many of those tourists are also enjoying the city ' s very recent proliferation of excellent restaurants . One delightful spot in Center City is the Commissary , a cafeteria that dispenses such gourmet fare as pates , galantines , French entrees , and sumptuous desserts prepared by its seven full-time bakers . Another is the Garden restaurant , particularly popular for savoring a summer lunch ( the avacado stuffed with curried mussels is sublime ) in its flowering patio. // Sightseeing in Center City can easily be done on foot  --  the most popular routes leading through Independence National Historic Park where lovely old Independence Hall , the Liberty Bell ( to touch its aged , smooth surface is truly a thrill ) , and a splendid portrait gallery housed inside the Second Bank are among the long-renowned historic spots. // Walking through nearby Society Hill gives access to a wonderful mixture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine brick row houses restored to 18- and 19-century granduer . Many of those houses were salvaged by their present owners when redevelopment of the once depressed , crumbling area was started in 1957 . A few , such as the elegant Powel House ( George Washington **28;6189; danced <> there ) , are open to public view. // Bordering Society Hill is New Market where , on summer weekends , craftspeople and vendors exhibit their wares from brick stalls in a small area flanked by smart shops and restaurants . Many of these shops are enclosed in a glass and brick complex which , with its waterfront view and open-air fountain , has been called " The Ghirardelli Square of the East. " // Just beyond New Market is another area of impressive redevelopment  --  Queen Village , a neighborhood started by working class Philadelphians during the late 18th century . Restoration of the brick houses , much smaller than those in Society Hill , has been newly completed by some of the owners ; for many others there is still work to be done . Here , still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another corner of the nation ' s birthplace is being reborn. // //
