One day last week , before a preliminary round in the NCAA championships , Iowa coach Dan Gable was in Room 403 at the Ramada Inn in Calverton , Md . He had just finished a tense meeting with his team by asking , " Any questions ? " At which time Royce Alger , his 167-pound Designated Mouth , said , " Yes . What is the capital of Alaska ? " // " Anchorage , " said Gable without missing a beat or changing expression or getting it right . " Any other questions ? " // It has been that kind of year for Gable  --  bizarre , distracting , off-the-wall and trying . Yet , despite all their problems , the Hawkeyes seemed to be slipping and sliding toward a 10th straight national title , a feat no college team in any sport had ever accomplished . Moments after the team meeting , one of Gable 's three daughters , Jennifer , 9 , asked , " Daddy , can we really win ? " Said Gable softly , " Right now the chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got dead right . // By late Saturday afternoon Iowa had lost in the NCAAs for the first time since 1977 . Its conqueror was Iowa State , Gable 's alma mater , the team that won back in ' 77 . The Cyclones wrestled brilliantly , winning 4 of 10 weight classes , while the Hawkeyes won only 2 . When Iowa State coach Jim Gibbons was asked whether he felt bad about denying Gable his history-making 10th title , Gibbons said , " Yeah , I do . " // Indeed , all attention at the tournament was focused on whether Iowa would break the record shared by the Yale golf teams of 1905-13 and the USC track teams of 1935-43 ; those teams had won nine consecutive national championships . Unfortunately , all the Iowa-this , Iowa-that stuff , day in and day out , obscured a lights-out performance by the Cyclones . Nobody gave Iowa State much chance of upsetting the Hawkeyes , which just goes to show that nobody really knew what lay in the hearts of the Cyclones , who had been chafing for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success and celebrity . // Understand , it was not as if Iowa State did n't know the difference between a takedown and a reversal . The Cyclones had won six NCAA titles themselves but had struggled during the waning years of their legendary coach , Harold Nichols . He was in Ames for 32 years and stayed too long at the dance . During Nichols 's last four years , from 1982 through ' 85 , the Cyclones were 0-8 against Iowa in dual meets . Iowa State fans had become discouraged , and Iowa fans had become bored . A rivalry requires two . // Then along came Gibbons , 27 , a positive-thinking dynamo ( and NCAA champ for the Cyclones at 134 pounds in 1981 ) who roared onto the scene with new words and new ways . Since he took over as coach , Iowa State has split four dual meets with Iowa . He said that one of the secrets of his squad 's success last week was that from the Big Eight championships on , " we did n't say a negative word to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they could do no wrong , and that 's what happened . We had to wrestle a perfect tournament to win , and we did . " // Just the way Iowa usually does . But on Saturday the Cyclones had placed five wrestlers in the finals to four for the Hawkeyes . Moreover , for Iowa to retain the title it had to win all its matches , get bonus points in at least one of those victories and pray that Iowa State lost all of its matches . A tall order , but when you 're talking about Iowa , anything is possible . // To accommodate ABC , which wanted to highlight the Iowa  --  Iowa State confrontation , the NCAA began Saturday 's program with the 167-pound match between Alger and the Cyclones ' Kevin Jackson , a remarkable physical specimen even among wrestlers . Alger is not blessed with great talent , but he is an ornery competitor . This season he was 35-0 , but that was easy because he only took on one guy at a time . This is a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him into oblivion . // One win and three to go . You do n't suppose ... ? Alger was ecstatic . Overlooking the task that lay ahead for his team , he said , " I can hardly wait for next year . I am ready to knock some people down . " // Typical Iowa . The Hawks had swaggered into College Park with an arrogance that was downright , well , appealing . All year they wore the Roman numeral X on their uniforms to signify their undying quest of title No. 10 . They talked of nothing else . And , in truth , while many groused about Gable 's domination of the sport , few besides the Cyclones did n't want him to win last weekend . What the heck . Since he owned the sport , why not let him go ahead and plant the flag in a historical way ? Then they could just change the name of the sport from wrestling to Gabling , bronze him and be done with it . // Yet for all their accomplishments and bluster , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall short of their goal . Most notably perhaps Brad Penrith , the defending NCAA champ at 126 pounds , who was convicted on a drunk-driving charge and had to sit out the first semester with poor grades . However , he had been gangbusters since coming back . // Following the Alger-Jackson match , Penrith took on the Cyclones ' Billy Kelly . Penrith can scramble , and he took it to the conservative Kelly . With half a minute to go in the match , Penrith led 3-2 and was still pressing . He tried a driving single-leg takedown , got back on his heels and was yanked off balance by the opportunistic Kelly , who pinned him with a blazing move . What was that move you put on Penrith ? Said Kelly , " I call it a pin . " Whatever , it clinched the championship for the Cyclones. // Their fans went nuts . Several lifted a sign that had a giant X with a line drawn diagonally through it . From there on it was all Iowa State . // In the next match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iowa 's defending national champ at 150 pounds , Jim Heffernan , in overtime . Afterward , a frustrated Heffernan kicked Krieger 's headgear  --  fortunately his head was not in it  --  well beyond the mat. // Now things really started getting fun for Iowa State . Along came 158-pounder Stewart Carter , who had never won a significant tournament in high school or college until the Big Eights on March 7 . He defeated Clarion 's Ken Haselrig by a score of 6-3 . Finally Cyclone sophomore Eric Voelker , who missed six weeks of the season with a knee injury , beat Minnesota 's Dave Dean 4-3 for the 190-pound title . " I expected this , " said Voelker , " because it was my goal . " Hmm , sounds a lot like Iowa over the past decade . // Iowa State ended up winning four of its five matches , Iowa only two of four . Afterward , Gibbons sounded like a man who expects to be challenging for championships for some time to come . " What we did , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday , " was show other teams that they can do the same thing . And we did n't back in . We took it . " // " We 're still a dynasty , " insisted Iowa 's Alger . " We 're just taking a year off . " But Gable knows that dynasties ca n't take years off . " I do n't have many losses in life , and I think I needed one , " he said . " This will motivate me . " It had better . Gable admits his recruiting has fallen off in the last two years , and ISU will be loaded again next season . // Is Gable sorry that his team flaunted its goal by wearing the X 's ? No way . " They will always remind me of what we did n't get , " he said . " A little pain will make me work harder . " And so the Hawkeyes are bloodied but unbowed . And Gable is left to wonder if there might be any prospects in , oh , Juneau.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
