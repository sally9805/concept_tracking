Headed up by Carroll Shelby - renowned auto racer , sports-car designer , and , as Iacocca describes him , ' ' my old partner in crime on Cobras in the early ' 60s ' ' - the Chrysler-Shelby Performance Center ' s only reason for existence is to plunge the resurgent Chrysler Corporation back into the automotive performance business at a bargain-basement price. // Its specialty is not the big-ticket racing cars that other carmakers support , but cars that the ordinary motorist can afford. // When the high-performance ' ' think tank ' ' officially opened its doors in the fall of 1982 - on the back lot of Chrysler ' s new-car preparation center here at Santa Fe Springs - Chrysler president Harold K. Sperlich defined its goal as the development of efficient , fun-to-drive cars that are ' ' easy on the pocket and easy on the gas. ' ' // The power-packed Shelby Charger , for example , was developed here , with a turbocharged version expected to hit the road in May. // ' ' I believe that Chrysler is doing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrepreneur who earned his racing spurs in the 1950s . ' ' It isn ' t trying to be fancy . . . . It ' s putting its money on cars that people want to buy rather than what those bums in Detroit think they ought to buy. ' ' // Shelby , a gruff , plain-speaking cowboy who owns a ranch in east Texas , doesn ' t mince words . His commendation of Chrysler ' s market strategy is seconded by some experts in the field. // ' ' Performance seems to come and go as a trend , ' ' says Martin Anderson , executive officer of the Future of the Automobile Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . ' ' It ' s on the up-cycle right now , ' ' he adds . ' ' Every time you have good economic times , performance begins to count in the car market. // ' ' So I think what Chrysler is doing is a good idea and well timed . One of the things that the Europeans and the Japanese have been able to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' is to provide performance in low-cost cars. ' ' // Situated just east of Los Angeles , the Chrysler-Shelby Performance Center includes a metal-fabrication shop , paint and fiberglass department , and a 15 , 000-square-foot garage with 10 stalls , engine buildup areas , and machine shop . Outside there ' s a quarter-mile drag strip with a seven-acre skid course nearby. // The place is freshly painted , dressed up , and humming with hot-shot cars - and with motivated people who admit they like to work with former racer Carroll Shelby at the wheel. // What Shelby does not want is ' ' people problems , ' ' he insists . ' ' Every time someone in Detroit says , ' Hey , I feel you need a couple more engineers , ' I tell him : ' Let ' s leave it the way it is . You ' ve got to keep things small if they ' re going to work in a place such as this. ' // ' ' If we tried to work on too many projects here , we ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds . Although the test center has only 15 people in the crew , they now have the capability of building a car from the ground up. // ' ' We ' re building things like 16-valve heads , doing a lot of work on suspensions and chassis , and a heck of a lot of work on something that ' s very close to my heart - superchargers , ' ' he explains . ' ' I don ' t think the turbocharger is the end result of where we ' re going to be going in this thing , ' ' he adds . ' ' We ' ve tested about eight different kinds of supercharging systems , and we ' re coming up with some amazing results. ' ' // Both supercharger and turbocharger ( a form of supercharger ) provide more spirited performance by pumping an increased amount of air into the carburetor system , more than can be drawn in by cylinder vacuum alone . The supercharger usually operates from a direct link to the engine ; the turbocharger uses exhaust gases to drive a turbine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a sensible option . ' ' The motion is more direct , ' ' he asserts , ' ' it ' s cheaper , more durable , and there is not so much sophisticated electronics as in turbocharging. ' ' // Walking about Shelby ' s place , one sees cars in various states of adaptation . A souped-up Dodge Omni GLH , now in production and soon to be showing up at dealerships , turned in some dazzling performances. // Tests supervised by the National Hot Rod Association indicate the gussied-up Omni GLH , including rephased camshaft , 9. 6-to-1 compression ratio , and recalibrated electonics , is faster 0 to 50 m. p. h. than the Volkswagen Rabbit GTI or the Camaro Z-28. // That kind of performance is all in a day ' s work for the east Texas cowboy who seems never to be without his 10-gallon Stetson . Back in his racetrack days , striped bib overalls were another Shelby trademark. // One of the big advantages of a place such as this is the speed at which it can get a job done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4-door Omni in Detroit , ' ' sighs Shelby , ' ' we might get it out by 1987 instead of this year. ' ' // Originally the work on the second-generation Shelby Charger 2. 2 turbo was to be done at the Chrysler engineering headquarters in Detroit , but the job was moved to California . ' ' Speed is very important in the auto business , ' ' Shelby asserts. // A lot of the performance center ' s work will show up in Chrysler ' s Direct Connection catalog from which auto enthusiasts can order drive-enhancing equipment. // Talking about the performance center , Shelby says that ' ' a car that feels good in the hands of a man or women is really what is going to win for you in the end , and not spending $50 million a year in racing and then tooting your horn that if your cars win on the racetrack , then you can build better cars for the street. ' ' // Shelby was born in Leesburg , Texas , the son of a postman . When he was 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did his share of street racing during his teens . Then in World War II he became a flight instructor . Following the war he worked in the oil fields , built houses , and even tried to raise chickens. // He got a late start in auto racing and design - it wasn ' t until he was 29 that he first raced in sanctioned competition - but he quickly made up for it . Two years after that first race he turned professional . Eight years later he retired from driving with three national championships , a record string of 19 straight victories , and numerous wins in Europe , including Le Mans. // But unlike so many successful racers , Shelby found his greatest success after he retired from the racetrack . All through his years on the track he thought about creating a relatively inexpensive American sports car to compete with Europe ' s best . That car became the Shelby AC Cobra. // By 1970 , his ties with Ford Motor Company came to an end , and several years ago he went to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at Chrysler. // Besides his performance-car business with Chrysler , Shelby also is involved in a custom-wheel business as well as food packaging , cattle transport , land , gold mining in Africa , and chili. // Carroll Shelby is a restless man who stays on the go . Yet in his sparse office here at the Chrysler-Shelby Performance Center , he tips far back in his chair and reminisces gleefully about the past and where he believes racing is going in the future . He gets back to his ranch in east Texas as often as he can , but then , once there , is soon making plans for his next move. // At some point that ' ' next move ' ' will bring him back to Texas for good . ' ' I ' ll go back to my cows in east Texas , ' ' he says . ' ' I like high-tech farming ; that ' s my second love after automobiles. ' ' // //                   @ @
