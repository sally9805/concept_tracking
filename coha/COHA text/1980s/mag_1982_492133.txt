Not too long ago , Lee Iacocca was asked whether he 'd take over as head of the beleaguered Chrysler Corporation if he had to do it all over again . Probably not , he admitted . " I 'm a catcher now , not a pitcher , " he said . " And all I 'm doing is catching hell . " That 's his genius as well as his fate . He 's become the nation 's foremost symbol for " hanging tough , " for " toughing it out " under high-pressure nerve-wearing situations . He came out of nowhere to become the executive-apparent of Ford Motor Company  --  he was named to the key vice presidency at the age of 36 . He became the " industry genius " who conceived the Ford Mustang  --  which had the highest first-year sales in automobile history  --  and who later led Ford Motor Company to net profits of $1.8 billion in each of two successive years . It had n't been done before . It has n't been done since . So he was fired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was intent on plunging deeply into a new auto product of Italian design to counter his " friends " at Ford . The new car 's name : the vendetta . He did n't have a chance to indulge such pleasures . Chrysler was in such desperate trouble that he had to fight for survival , not for revenge . Things got so bad that he had to go against his own emotional grain and join in with the petition to the U.S. government to guarantee enough in loans ( up to $11/2 billion worth ) to keep Chrysler afloat . He was ridiculed by his employees , his suppliers and hisdealers  --  but he got them all to help him hang tough . He turned out to be one of the few headline-making organizational leaders who , when organizing everybody to hang tough , volunteered something more than the classic : " What we 'd like is for you to bleed for a while . " He volunteered to take a pay cut deeper than anyone else : from $360,000 a year to $1 a year . When a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that money , he smiled grimly . " Do n't worry , " he said . " I intend to spend it very carefully . " These last three years have been something of a turnaround for Lee Iacocca . The image of the man , past and present , is faithful to all incarnations . He is a hard-nosed , direct man who demands the absolute most from his underlings and who has virtually no patience for their delinquencies , however minor : When one of his senior vice presidents was two minutes late for the takeoff of a company plane on one occasion , Iacocca ordered the plane to leave without him . His underlings at Chrysler reacted tothe change from " easy rider " to " snap-to " leadership in the expected way : Some of them began calling him " Lee Ayatollah . The important fact about Lee Iacocca is not that he acts tough but that he does hang tough . His achievement is not that he 's a success in business ; it 's that he 's a success in life . As such , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to act and react in a world that offers unending pressure , not just in corporate life but in the personal experience of those individuals whose reach extends beyond their grasp . Here are , for example , six rules for hanging tough that can be developed out of the life and times of Lee Iacocca : The worst that could happen to Lee Iacocca took place when he was 15 : He was confined to bed for six months  --  a mentally and physically active teen-ager whose " permissible world " was four feet wide and six feet long . It was the year he fell ill with rheumatic fever . " Now they treat it much more easily  --  some medicine , continuing observation  --  unless it gets out of hand , " he says . " But it was a pretty serious event in those days. - Those days were 1939 , and the scene was Iacocca 's home in Allentown , Pennsylvania . Lido Iacocca  --  his first name from the resort , Lido Beach in Italy , where his mother and father honeymooned  --  was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most exciting times in world history : Hitler was about to invade Poland and throw Europe into World War II . So what is the severest punishment you can deliver to a teen-age boy under circumstances that  --  in the dullest of years  --  would enliven his life ? You can take him out of school and out of sports . You can make him lie flat on his back , immobilized . " I was in bed for six months , " says Iacocca . Any movement might have caused permanent damage to his heart  --  that was the classic aftermath of rheumatic fever . But when the pain passed , he was still in bed . For months . He did n't turn away from the physical in order to do nothing but stare at the ceiling . When he was forced to give up the physical , he turned to the cerebral . He began reading anything and everything that his parents brought him . " That 's when I really began reading books , - he says . He found that reading books is the key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lying on his back , that he could not experience everything . Nobody can . But from books he could acquire the kind of insight about other people 's experiences that would stick with him the rest of his life . His success in academics carried over to college . He got out of Lehigh University in 1945 with a degree in engineering and a grade-point average of 3.53 ? " with high honors " attached to his baccalaureate . His grades helped assure him that he could start immediately on his life 's high ambition . The Ford Motor Company was opening a training program for 50 engineers as part of its reach to the future . Iacocca had already been drawn to Ford , though the lines-of-drawing were fragile . His father , who 'd run a car-rental agency in Allentown , had made Ford his basic car . Lee had driven a Ford in high school and college . As a boy , he 'd had a " Model A " in " a barn on a farm " not far from town . He still has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxurious home in Bloomfield Hills near Detroit . So Ford had come to seem like " home " and the future to Lee Iacocca . He applied for the engineer-training program and fought his way into it . Then he heard about a further chance at higher education . Princeton was offering a particular fellowship to those who wanted to do post-graduate work in engineering . Iacocca was torn . On the one hand , he wanted very much to get started on his career . He set up , like many other young men , a goal and a timetable for himself : He wanted to be the top vice president of Ford at the age of 35 ? which seemed antique at the time  --  and then go on from there to become president , perhaps by 40 . On the other hand , education held the highest priority in his home and in his personal view . In the conflict of ambition and education , education won . He chose the higher value . He gave up the opportunity to plunge into Ford 's engineer-education program and instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he earned the degree , he went back to Ford and found the next training class was already filled . Moreover , it was headed by a new man  --  one who was n't around a year earlier when Iacocca had originally made his mark . But Lee talked hard and fast  --  and , apparently , logically  --  and the new man worked him into the training program as the 51st member . So now he had both the job and the education ; if he 'd given into the pressures of a year earlier , he 'd have had only the job . The irony is that he discovered eventually that he was the right man in the wrong job . He was a " people-oriented " person in an " object-oriented " job : Engineers deal only with " things , " and Lee Iacocca wanted to deal with people . He became restive , then unhappy . He wanted to switch out of engineering into sales or marketing . In retrospect , he might have been wrong . At the time , the engineering department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young successor to his father and grandfather as head of the company , was already deep into a brilliant rebuilding and restructuring job , had already gone outside the company to hire a chief engineer because there was not enough young , talented engineering help inside the company to invest with the leadership . That was one of three reasons Ford Motor started its engineer-training classes  --  to seek out and develop that kind of talent for the future . So Iacocca was already part of the elite ; he might have gone from there to rise swiftly to the top of the engineering department . But at the time , he was so far down the ladder he did n't see it , much less know it . So he lobbied hard to get transferred . He failed . Understandably , the company did n't want to set the precedent of taking in a bright engineer and then letting him decide what his future was and how he 'd go about pursuing it within the Ford Motor Company  --  particularly when the company knew that it needed help in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he could choose any career path he wanted  --  but not in Detroit at Ford Motors . Now he was faced with a critical choice of values . He could decide on security ( and dullness ) in engineering or career-risk ( and excitement ) in sales . He chose sales because that 's where the people were . He made the decision to leave the Ford Motor Company . At least he left the job in Detroit . But he was n't about to choose a value system and then drift ; he was still determined to have both the values and his ambition/desire . He went back home and looked around for a job . He found one  --  selling Ford trucks in Chester , Pennsylvania , about 50 or so miles south of his boyhood home . He was in sales , and he was still with Ford  --  in a distant kind of way . He was hired , curiously , because the truck boss felt Iacocca knew enough about engineering to talk " nuts and bolts " with the kind of people who wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars to Lee 's responsibilities , and Iacocca responded with a mental as well as a physical effort : He went to the owner-registration lists to find out who had the oldest cars in town and simply went around to them to see if it was n't time for them to get a new car . He spent almost 10 years doing face-to-face sales and local executive sales work . His big success came in 1956 , when he devised a slogan of " 56 in 56 " ? a monthly payment of $56 would buy a 1956 Ford . Sales soared . His district office went suddenly from 32nd in the nation to first . When a Ford executive named Robert McNamara , in a very high position ( soon to be president ) in Detroit , heard of it , he ordered the campaign to be used nationwide . The slogan is credited with having raised Ford sales in what was to be a down year . By year 's end , Iacocca had been summoned back to work in Detroit  --  in marketing . So he had both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Within four years , he 'd been promoted to general manager of the Ford division of the parent company , the second largest operating segment in the whole industry ( after GM 's Chevrolet ) . The point is that Iacocca chose his values and stuck with them and then worked hard to make the value system succeed  --  for itself and for him . So at the age of 36 , one year behind his timetable , he had the job in the executive structure that he 'd been aiming for . Rule 3 : When faced with a hang-tough problem , figure out what is causing the problem and then give your highest priority to overcoming that " cause . " That 's the engineering approach : Take a problem apart and separate it into its various components , find out which of the components is causing the problem , fix that part , then put the machine back together again . And everything works smoothly . In theory . In fact , some problems have a number of faulty parts , all of them working towards a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of problem that Iacocca encountered when he took over at Chrysler . He found problems with money ( or the lack of it ) , with car design , with quality control , with image , with dealers , with executive quality and , most of all , with information- and idea-management processes . " This company , " brooded Iacocca in one deeply depressed moment , " spent the last 25 years becoming decadent  --  I mean , rotten to the core . " All this forced a new perspective on Lee Iacocca . It was not only that he had more problems than ever ; it was that each problem had more than one problem-causing component within it . One example of a situation of many problems with many dimensions surfaced with the introduction of brand-new New Yorkers and St. Regises just about the time he was going to take the help at Chrysler . In concept , they were big cars when the times were demanding small cars . In quality  --  and top engineering was long supposed to have been Chrysler 's forte  --  they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line in Detroit had to be stopped before shipment and virtually reassembled . The repair and service facilities all over the entire Chrysler organization were swamped with cars . In this case , there was no chance for a " quick-fix , " for every problem ( except that of concept ) came back to quality control . If that could be solved , then perhaps other problems could be solved , now and in the future . But quality control affected many Chrysler models . And Iacocca continued from page 75 soon it involved many different partswithin-each-problem , each of which itself composed a problem . Soon Iacocca found there were more problems than time to fix them in the leisurely Chrysler tradition . Iacocca wanted them fixed now . It was n't easy . Some problems took years to solve . A problem with sealants on the basic Dodge truck , for example , continued unabated for four model years before Iacocca and his aides managed to overcome it . Other problems were simple to solve but were stunning in their scope : One truck assembly plant had 3,900 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after hour of " down " time as each truck passed a paint-checkpoint in the assembly line and the paint guns had to be put down , cleaned and restocked with a different shade of paint . It was n't hard to solve that problem ; it was just hard to figure out why it had ever come up in the first place . Out of all this , Iacocca and his people came up with new problem-solving machinery . Instead of waiting for the problems to appear , they set up groups to look for problems that might appear , to solve them before they began plaguing the public . The intriguing fact is that the " hunt groups " were set up in terms of the components of the entire car  --  the rattling-window flange was the responsibility of the " door group , " and there were other groups for the main sections of any auto . Thus the classic engineer 's custom of problem-solving by component was followed , albeit on a more exalted basis . The significant thing is that the system worked . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He believes that it is not merely an attractive car but a mechanically sound one . It gives economy and comfort  --  economy in gas-consumption , for example , that not only outstrips its American competition in the economy models but that eclipses the stringent standards set by the federal government . Rule 4 : In hanging tough , never be afraid to do the unconventional . Just after Lee Iacocca was promoted to general manager of the Ford car division , he came face to face with the intolerable tyranny of statistics : Fordwas losing more and more of its auto market . Some thought that it was because Ford 's styling was somewhat sober , not to say stodgy . And it was expected to stay that way . So there was a certain satisfaction among a few that Lee Iacocca would not quite hang tough ; he 'd merely hang , for it took three to five years to get a new car from a vague idea in somebody 's mind to a reality in a showroom . Lee Iacocca had other ideas . He was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " baby boom . " It had started in 1946 , when the soldiers came home after World War II . The " booming babies . ' would be 18 years old , be getting out of high school into a roaring economy and he looking for wheels by 1964 . The trouble was that Ford had no car that would appeal to that market and was not planning to produce one . The concept of going through all the agony of a single-market car was repellent to a good many Ford executives who 'd been singed or burned badly by the $350 million fiasco of the Edsel . Even Henry Ford II was not overly enthusiastic about risk-taking into the future . So Lee Iacocca did the unconventional . He decided against spending three to five years in developing a new car . Instead , he put a stunning new car together out of parts and pieces that were already in stock . The basic platform for the new car he proposed , for example , was the Ford Falcon , which came out in 1959 . He hung on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , yet another car whose parts were in stock on a shelf in a warehouse . He had to fight a running battle over this witha number of Ford executives  --  including Henry II  --  who did n't think this could be done . Or should be done . Yet Iacocca plunged ahead , knowing that by using parts that were in stock or otherwise available meant that he would n't have to get parts engineered for the new car ; it also meant that he did n't have to spend tens or hundreds of millions of dollars  --  or years of time  --  getting tools designed and constructed to turn out those parts ; the tools were already in place . Iacocca called the car the Mustang . It was introduced on April 19 , 1964 ? just before high school graduation for all those soon-to-be- " wheeling " teenagers  --  and it sold a startling 417,800 units in its first year . The result was that Ford stopped its skid in the marketplace and began gaining ground once again on Chevrolet . Iacocca was kicked upstairs even before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over all of Ford 's car and truck operations and he proceeded to do the same unconventional thing all over again to come up with another stunning success : This time it was the renowned Mark series of the Lincoln division , the high-priced car of the company 's whole line of cars . The Mark was not designed from the ground up any more than was the Mustang . It was put together basically with a new skin , some new technology and a new grill hung on the platform of a Ford Thunderbird . The result : Ford Motors made $800 million net profit from the Mark in one year . And he went on to become president of the company , answerable only to Henry II . After he moved over to Chrysler , Iacocca " hung tough " through a number of unconventional moves . One example : He sought government help in the form of the loan-guarantees for that 811/2 billion ) , though " purists " in the faith of a conservative and free market economy insisted that Chrysler should have been happy to collapse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iacocca long shared that view . " The theory I was born into , " he says , " would be against getting that bailout . " But he was forced to act in a practical manner , not a theoretical one . Another unconventional act was his decision to ask Douglas Fraser , head of the auto workers ' union , to join Chrysler 's board of directors . To most businessmen , union leaders are the enemy . " But Iacocca perceived that he 'd have to make an extraordinary gesture to get what Chrysler needed most : the cooperation of its people who were members of the United Auto Workers . Without it , there was no doubt that Chrysler would go under . And any concern for the company had to involve a concern for those people . So Doug Fraser was invited to share the responsibility for Chrysler and its future . One further unconventional move involved Iacocca 's self-immolating cut to a salary of $1 a year . To take so massive a cut in pay is unconventional in any form of American life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting his own pay by $359,999 a year . " I did it for good , cold , pragmatic reasons , not to get a monument erected to me in the park for being noble , " he says . Rule 5 : Get others involved in your problems . In most cases , you simply can not do everything alone . Ever since he got to Detroit , Iacocca has shown a certain genius for getting people involved in his hang-tough procedures . His technique : He gets involved in their dreams . His device for both is quite simple : He asks each of his key people to give him a quarterly report to tell him what they 've accomplished in the last three months and hope to accomplish in the upcoming months . In an obvious way . this looks like a tough-minded method of making his associates accountable . It is , but it 's also a way of making them accountable to themselves even more than to him . The quarterly reports force his associates to analyze their own goals and what they are doing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream , but that often he lets it elude him in the frantic pace of executive life . In this way , Iacocca keeps that executive aware of the dream . lie knows that the discipline of writing about it is the first step in making it concrete . The labor of writing and the concentration that it demands arouse in most people an awareness of what must be done next to make the dream come true . Of course , Iacocca wants to know what they 've been doing , in and on their jobs , and what they expect to do next . He talks with those who 've fallen short on their goals to see if they know why they have fallen short . He 'd delight as much in talking with those who 'd achieved all their goals and more . Thus the underling comes to understand that not only is Continued on page 116 he involved with Iacocca and his problems , but that Iacocca is involved with him and his dreams , and that makes for a stronger bond than one ever learns in graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams . Do n't just solve problems  --  reach for a dream . For a long while , Lee Iacocca 's dream was to run an auto company . He 's realized that dream . Twice over . At the peak and at the abyss of auto prosperity . He got to the presidency of Ford Motors and found it rich in  --  among other things  --  personal insult . For years after Iacocca became president , word leaked out that his boss , Henry II , was running a long , quiet and expensive investigation of him . There were rumors and reports that as much as a million dollars were spent on the investigation  --  that found nothing . Or at least nothing that would merit any kind of action . There was never any kind of explanation as to why Henry II was investigating his own chief aide , the president of his own company , and doing so without result . The investigation had been over for a number of years when suddenly Ford called Iacocca in one day and fired him . So Iacocca possessed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more inspiring in the reaching than in the realization . His dream of going to Chrysler was not in heading another auto company . It was involved with a much more sophisticated structure . Iacocca calls it , tantalizingly , Global Motors ( GM  --  of course ) and sees it , in his dream , as an international auto company , one that could compete throughout the world against the huge entities : in one country against General Motors , in another against " Japan , Inc. , " or  --  as in the United States  --  against both of them . By exploiting an international grouping of skills , a Global Motors just might achieve or hope to achieve  --  higher quality at lower cost . For instance , the U.S. no longer has the largest steel firm in the world and has not had it for many years ; clearly there is a reason that steel firms elsewhere outstrip the United States , and the reason is likely to be price : Foreign steel undersells U.S. steel , even in the U.S. Similarly with rubber and glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries that might allow Global Motors to develop an " international community of resources " and , by doing so , put out a more economical car from engineering developed in the United States , which may he our last useful export , In the weeks and months after he left Ford , Iacocca focused on the dream . He studied antitrust law . He studied the plant-usages and cost-effectiveness in various components of a number of companies . He studied marketing concepts and marketing organizations . He looked at a good many companies ; rumors later began to circulate that there was a " relationship ' ' involving Volkswagen and Peugeot , but there was never any comment from Iacocca . There were n't too many U.S. companies that could be involved in his dream : not GM , because it is already so vast ; not Ford , because he 'd already been dismissed from there ; that left only tiny American Motors  --  and Chrysler . He went to Chrysler not just to make Chrysler whole again but to see if it might fit into his dream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelling and as elusive as ever . One problem was that Chrysler was in greater trouble than he anticipated . Another was that the nation was also in trouble , economically speaking . When he went to Chrysler , he thought he 'd have the company turned around and made over into a solid profitmaker within three years . In fact , the company 's losses have soared as sales  --  all through the auto industry  --  plummeted . Iacocca predicted that Chrysler would make $383 million in profit in 1981 ; he missed by about $600 million  --  Chrysler had lost roughly $300 million by the end of last year . But some of the other car companies had their own financial troubles in 1981 as well . For Lee Iacocca , it is not that the dream has disappeared . It is merely altered in its imperatives . There are many who believe that Chrysler will have to merge with somebody somewhere for some reason if it is to enjoy long-term success  --  or survival . The Chrysler board of directors has a committee looking into the status of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it regularly receives reports on what it has found . The big step is in making a public admission that there is a discussion or an agreement on the manner of financing and of the exchange of ownership that would make the dream come true . There is no such admission . But the dream is still there , beckoning Iacocca to work harder  --  to hang tougher than ever  --  on harder-than-ever problems . ' A
