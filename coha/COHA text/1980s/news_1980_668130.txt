Isn ' t he a sweetheart ? Wouldn ' t you love having him look over your shoulder as you go about your work ? Isn ' t he the epitome of the warm- hearted , kindly , grandfatherly employer ? George Steinbrenner ought to be in the Guinness Book of World Records , second-guessing division . He is the nitpicking champion of the universe , the King of Arrogance . He is the ultimate sore loser . His open criticism of Yankee third-base coach Mike Ferraro for sending Willie Randolph home to what turned out to be certain death in the second game of the American League playoffs should have come as no surprise , I suppose . This shameless second guessing , this 20-20 hindsight is standard modus operandi for the Yankee owner . His idea of providing inspiration is to ridicule , to instill the fear of God in his employees . To Steinbrenner of course , God and George are synonymous . He runs the Yankees the way the cotton barons of the South ran their plantations . Bow low , say " Yassa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mistake , however , and you get 20 lashes . In the pre-Civil War South , the lashes came from a whip . But the laws and mores of contemporary society preclude that , so Steinbrenner has to settle for tongue lashing . George , of course , never made a mistake of the magnitude of the one he nailed Ferraro for . Well , there was that one le mistake - the illegal contribution to Richard M. Nixon ' s campaign fund , for which Steinbrenner pleaded guilty and was fined by the courts . He was also suspended from baseball for two years , a suspension he wriggled out of long before his time was up . But that trifling indiscretion certainly can ' t compare in severity with sending Randolph home Thursday in Kansas City . The man is evidently a shrewd businessman , but when the umpire yells " Play ball " he puts on short pants , grabs a pail and shovel and jumps into the sandbox . He becomes Red Skelton ' s mean wittle kid , pouting and stamping his feet and throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late innings of Thursday ' s game , throwing his arms in dismay as Bobby Murcer struck out and then , when a double play ended the thing in the ninth , stalking furiously from his box seat . If looks could have killed , the Yankees would have had to fly the Columbus Triple A team in to complete the playoffs , because the major league team would be laid out , along the third-base line with a lily on each chest . It ' s been said that Steinbrenner tosses these criticisms off in a calculated way , to get his slaves angry , so they ' ll play harder the next night . If so , it ' s not only a simplistic approach , it ' s an affront to Dick Howser , the Yankee manager , whose duties presumably include motivating his ballplayers . Steinbrenner said yesterday Ferraro should not be coaching third base . " I never wanted him at third , " Steinbrenner said . " I thought he belonged someplace else . I told that to Dick Howser over and over again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , really ? Then why tell it to Howser over and over again ? If he ' s the manager , let him manage and you stay in the executive sandbox . The 36-year-old Ferraro was a journeyman major league infielder with a lifetime .232 average in 162 games with the Yankees , Seattle and Milwaukee . He managed in the Yankee system at Oneonta , Fort Lauderdale , West Haven and Tacoma before replacing Howser as third-base coach for the Yankees last season . Asked about Steinbrenner ' s criticism , Ferraro replied : " He ' s got a right to say what he wants to say . To me it ' s part of the job . If people want to take cracks at me , it ' s up to them . " Yes , but it ' s up to Ferraro to make split-second decisions at third base , and Steinbrenner ' s pettiness can do nothing but cloud Ferraro ' s mind the next time a runner comes pounding around third and the game ' s on the line . " I think Steinbrenner ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the coach said . " I heard last year that he might fire me . " The playoffs have not been kind to Italian-American third-base coaches . Lee Elia of the Phils was under the microscope for not sending the winning run home in the ninth of the second Natonal League playoff game . Now Ferraro is skewered for the opposite reason . However , in Philadelphia , there was no plantation owner making the easy second-guess , no mean wittle kid hopping up and down because his lollipop had been taken from him . " I worked my chops off five years in the minors for the Yankees , " said Ferraro . " I come up here and I ' m his ( Steinbrenner ' s ) worst enemy . " Tom Boswell of the Washington Post had the best description of Steinbrenner ' s outburst . " They ought to call this Bonzo Goes to the Playoffs , ' " said Boswell . Talking about the play , Ferraro said : " I ' m thinking about speed , and I thought I had the guy ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to do over , I ' d send him again . " Being third-base coach for the Yankees , you can ' t make many mistakes . " You got it wrong , Mike . With George Steinbrenner , you can ' t make any .
