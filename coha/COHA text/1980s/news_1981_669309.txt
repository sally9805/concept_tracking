These are among conclusions of a Monitor survey of 526 political scholars at the American Political Science Association ( APSA ) convention in New York City Sept. 3 to 6. // Although the scholars often disagree as a group with the current administration ' s policies , or think results will be hard to achieve , they give President Reaganhigh grades for his early command of the Washington scene. // However , the Monitor survey shows the political scientists largely stable in their liberal Deocratic outlook . Full professors and graduate students hold similar political philosophies , which are also reflected by the social science profession as a whole , as show by studies over the past decade. // If anything , the young and women , the expanding or newer groups in the profession , are more critical of the administration. // Hence a " Reagan revolution " will likely have to win its own support  --  by its achievements  --  on the nation ' s campuses , where 2 million youths are expected to study political issues this fall. // Half of the questions on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general public . The experts ' and the public ' s views , predictably , often differed. // But the scholars and the public agreed almost to the percentage point on the question " How sound is the American political system ? " both groups calling it sound , by a 2-to-1 margin . Thirteen percent of the scholars said it was " basically sound and essentially good , " and 55 percent " basically sound but needs some improvements . " Again , an identical majority of scholarsand the general public ( 56 percent for both ) think Americans have not seen the best of times. // Opinion experts caution that elites like political scholars may view questions in different terms from the public . Often elites respond by class or income , or with a different specific sense of what the question asks. // Still , it is interesting to note how the experts and the public converge and disagree on a number of reforms , issues , and trends. // The political scientists and the public are at opposite ends of the scale on a constitutional amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1 against it , the public 5 to 1 in favor. // The political scientists ( 51 percent ) are a little more likely than the public ( 44 percent ) to think the quality of life of blacks in the US has gotten better over the past 10 years. // On the equal rights amendment , which would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex , the scholars ( 83 percent ) favor the constitutional change more emphatically than the public ( 63 percent ) . // On abortion , now both a constitutional and congressional issue , the scholars and public both favor legal abortion by at least 9 to 1 when the woman ' s health is endangered . But the public splits evenly on abortion if the woman is married and wants no more children , or if she is not married and does not want to marry the man . The political scientists by more than 4-to-1 majorities , like similarly educated Americans generally , would still favor the woman ' s ability to get a legal abortion under those conditions. // On institutional reforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six-year term for president  --  the scholars by 3 to 1 , the public by 2 to 1. // The scholars ( 71 per cent ) again oppose a two-term , 12-year limit for Senate officeholders , while the bublic by 2 to 1 approves the change . The public also is barely more inclined to tinker with the system by doubling the terms for members of the House of Representatives from two to four years . Fifty-one percent of the public this change in a May 1981 Gallup survey , while the same percentage of political scholars oppose it in the Monitor sampling. // The political scientists by 72 percent to 28 percent would shift the national voting day from Tuesday to Sunday . However , the public indicates voter turnout would not increase based on such a shift . Three-fourths of the public said in a June 1981 CBS-New York Times survey that the voting day change would have no effect on their likelihood to vote. // On a more-debated voting issue , both the political scientists and public favor a change from the electoral college to direct pupular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 67 percent of the public favor such a change. // On whether to change the presidential nominating system , which now features state primaries that take place randomly from New Hampshire in February to California in June , 55 percent of the scholars favor holding regional or time-zone primaries in succeeding weeks , 24 percent prefer a national primary , and 21 percent would keep the current system. // Overall , the Monitor survey revealed little disaffection toward the system of foreboding for the nation among the political scholars. // Younger scholars tended to be more disapproving of the Reagan administration . Women scholars  --  a fifth of the sample  --  tended to see more of a negative impact from its policies . But both subgroups tended to agree with the whole survey group on non-Reagan-related professional questions. // The attitudes of the women scholars toward Reagan stand out , as did the judgment of similarly educated women during the last election . The women APSA respondents were 15 points more negative in disapproving of Reagan ' s handling of the presidency than the men . And while the men approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent majority , the women disapproved by 64 percent. // The younger sholars , graduate students , were more inclined ( 79 percent ) than full professors ( 51 percent ) to think the US is spending too much for defense and the military . But on questions such as whether Reagan can simultaneously build up the military and balance the budget , they were in almost exact agreement. // The young were more disapproving of Reagan ' s " new federalism "  --  the shift in power and authority from the federal government to the state and local levels . But they and the professors generally agreed Reagan likely would shift only " some power , " or " little or no power " to lower government levels . They agreed , too , that the primary shift would be in " some " or " considerable " net costs , rather than power , from the federal government. // Over 2 , 500 APSA scholars attended the Labor Day conference and received questionaires . The APSA has 7 , 000 members. // The University of Connecticut ' s Roper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the design , processing , and analysis of the survey . The APSA , Thomas E.
