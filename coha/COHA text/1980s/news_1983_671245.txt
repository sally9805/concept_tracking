" It meant that at the important high-level functions here , there simply would be no blacks to let the world know that our nation is truly multiracial , " said Mr. Todman , who is regarded as the State Department ' s most prominent black career officer . He added : " It ' s distressing to think that five years later , that ' s still the case. " // Mr. Todman ' s comments met with nods of agreement at a recent gathering of the Thursday Luncheon Group , an organization of black Foreign Service officers that has often expressed concern about the number of blacks in the upper levels of the State Department. // As of March 31 1983 , according to department statistics , members of minority groups accounted for 11. 5 percent of Foreign Service officers serving in the United States and abroad , and of the total of 3 , 744 officers , 234 , or about 6. 3 percent , were black . Four years ago , members of minority groups accounted for 8. 3 percent of Foreign Service officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massive Problem ' Cited // Donald F. McHenry , the United States Representative at the United Nations in the Carter Administration , and currently a professor of diplomacy at Georgetown University , described the State Department ' s recruitment and promotion of black officers as " a massive problem , " adding : " There ' s been a clear setback under the Reagan Administration , and that , after a period of substantial progress , accentuates the setback. " // The scarcity of blacks is even greater in senior policymaking positions , said Representative George W. Crockett Jr. , a Michigan Democrat who is a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee . According to figures compiled by Mr. Crockett , of the 127 current ambassadorial positions , only seven are now held by blacks , down from a high of 14 during the Carter Administration . And of these , only one , Mr. Todman , holds a European ambassadorial post . The other black Ambassadors are assigned to Trinidad and Tobago , Malawi , Togo and Guyana , Sierra Leone and Malaysia. // For the first time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacks serve as Assistant Secretary of State in any of the department ' s regional bureaus . Similarly , only four blacks work at the next level , as Deputy Assistant Secretary. // " There are only a few blacks in senior policymaking positions at the State Department , " Mr. Crockett noted , " and there does not appear to be the slightest pretense that any more are wanted . " <> <> Spokesman Notes Improvement // However , a spokesman for the State Department , emphasized that there had been significant improvement . " We have relatively few blacks and other minorities at senior grade levels , " said the spokesman who asked not to be identified . He added , though , that " in a system such as ours , where most recruitment is at the bottom , it takes time before affirmative action programs will impact at the top. " // " The promotion process , " the spokesman went on , " has dramatically increased minority representation at the midcareer level , and within several years , we expect to have significant increases in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of normal advancement. " // A 1977 task force headed by Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance concluded that the Foreign Service suffered from an image as " elitist , self-satisified , a walled-in barony populated by smug white males , an old-boy system in which women and minorities can not possibly hope to be treated with equity in such matters as promotions and senior level responsibilities . " <> <> Steady Rise Through the Ranks // Until recently in fact , the 57-year-old Mr. Todman was one of the few black diplomats who seemed to have risen steadily through the State Department ranks . He entered the Foreign Service in 1956 , has served in key posts in Africa and Central America , and been Ambassador to Chad , Costa Rica and the Republic of Guinea. // In 1977 , Mr. Todman was appointed by President Carter as Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs . A year later , he was named Ambassador to Spain , the first black to head what is called a " class-1 embassy , " a term applied to large diplomatic missions or those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some of the black career officers gathered around Mr. Todman recently , that his career had suffered what they perceived as a setback by the appointment earlier this month of Thomas O. Enders , the former Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs , as Ambassador to Spain. // To make room for Mr. Enders there , Mr. Todman is expected to be moved to Denmark , a " class-3 embassy . " Some current and former State Department officials have said that would be only the latest example of the Reagan Administration ' s insensitivity to promoting black career officers . <> <> No Step Down Seen // Mr. Todman denies that the Denmark job would be a step down . " Very frankly , I was asked if I was interested in Denmark , and I said , absolutely yes , " he said . He also noted that most ambassadorial assigments last for two or three years , and that he had served in Spain for slightly more than five years. // In addition , Mr. Todman said , Denmark is of increasing importance to the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last December , Denmark ' s parliament voted to freeze that country ' s contribution to the deployment of new United States missiles in Western Europe , the first member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to take such a stand. // Mr. Crockett , however , sees things differently . " We now have about five black Ambassador ' s wandering around the corridors of the State Deparment . " Mr. Crockett said . " Until the Reagan Administration came into office , all of them had served honorably , but one by one , they were recalled to Washington. // " And while other career officers have been given assignments comparable to their grade level in the State Department , the blacks have been passed over.
