" The harm you are doing by espousing the ' pro-choice ' view will require great efforts to repair , " San Diego Bishop Leo Maher wrote last week to Lucy Killea , 67 , a Democrat running in a special election for California 's state senate . He then applied a little used sanction that denies Communion to Catholics who " obstinately persist in manifest grave sin . " Killea says she will abide by the decree but will not change her position . She is the first political candidate to receive this censure . <P> Catholics who take pro-choice stands have been particularly frustrating to the nation 's bishops , who have been asked to respond decisively to dissenters . But a spokesman said it is highly unlikely that Maher 's precedent would become national Catholic policy .
