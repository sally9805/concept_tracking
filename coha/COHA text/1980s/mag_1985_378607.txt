A legitimate , perhaps indispensable part of diplomacy is symbolism . Whenever statesmen get together , it serves to remind the world , and the principals themselves , that for all the complexities of arms control and other matters of discussion , much still depends on individuals . It is not just systems that clash or coexist , but human beings . <P> What was most significant about the imagery in Geneva last week was not that two men were meeting at the summit  --  that is , at the peak of personal and national power  --  but that they were , for nearly five hours , meeting off to one side alone . Their apparent personal rapport , or at least civility and restraint , made the meeting a symbolic success . But on the most important issue confronting them , controlling the arsenals of nuclear weapons , there is no assurance that the " fresh start " and " momentum " they spoke about will actually lead anywhere . Not only was there no resolution of the basic issues dividing the two sides , which could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of progress toward resolution , a more reasonable hope . How American plans to develop space-based strategic defenses can be reconciled with the quest for deep reductions in strategic offenses remains as much of a conundrum as ever . An American negotiator who is a regular at the ongoing arms-control talks in Geneva remarked , " It 's nice to have our bosses wish us luck and urge us to do our best , but the nitty-gritty of our work here is going to be as tough as ever . " <P> Thursday 's joint statement required intensive negotiation , yet it was little more than an enumeration of the lowest common denominators of the relationship . On arms control , it mostly reiterated earlier declarations of intent or endorsed vague goals that have already provoked dispute . The " principle " of a 50% reduction in nuclear arms begs such extremely tricky questions as whether gravity bombs aboard bombers ( in which the U.S. has an advantage ) should be lumped together with more threatening warheads atop large missiles ( in which the Soviets have the lead ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compromise on medium-range weapons , which Washington first floated in 1983 and Moscow proposed this fall . But there again , both sides are still a long way from agreement about what kinds of weapons should count . <P> On the critical issue of the Strategic Defense Initiative , the document contains nothing more than a reaffirmation of a communiqu that Secretrary of State George Shultz signed with former Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko in January , along with a vow to " accelerate the work " of the arms talks . Said one participant in those talks : " To accelerate implies that we were already moving . We were n't , and we still are n't . We 're maneuvering for position around square one . " <P> Some of the U.S. officials who came to Geneva with Reagan had hoped the final document would include another reaffirmation , that of the antiballistic-missile ( ABM ) treaty of 1972 . Advocates of arms control within the Administration want to seize every opportunity to commit the U.S. to keeping SDI within the bounds of that treaty . Doing so , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why was there no mention of the ABM treaty in the joint statement ?
