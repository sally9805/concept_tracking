Scotland Yard took the Libyans to a " safe house " in the London suburbs , where they were closely questioned , before putting them aboard a Libyan Arab Airlines flight to Tripoli. // The group was believed almost certainly to have included the gunman who , according to witnesses , killed a policewoman , Yvonne Fletcher , and wounded 10 opponents of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi , the Libyan leader , who were demonstrating outside the embassy on April 17. // Tonight , the Libyans were reported to have received a vociferous welcome in Tripoli , the Libyan capital . In a carefully synchronized move , the remaining British officials in Libya hauled down the Union Jack over their embassy , and all but two of them then left for home . ( Page 3. ) // // // Weapon Is Presumed Gone // A Libyan air freighter , laden with diplomatic bags , furniture and other gear , returned to Tripoli earlier in the day , and the police said the weapon used to fire at the people outside the embassy was presumably on board . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wall and searched them , finding no firearms , but protocol forbade examination of any of the baggage. // The body of Miss Fletcher was cremated this afternoon after a funeral in the 13th-century cathedral at Salisbury , not far from her home in the tiny Wiltshire hamlet of Semley . Leon Brittan , the Home Secretary , who coordinated British actions during the crisis , and hundreds of police officers from throughout the country were there to pay tribute to the woman who fulfilled a childhood dream to serve on the force although , at 5 feet 2 1/2 inches , she was too short to qualify. // On top of her coffin was her uniform cap , which had lain where she fell , tossed by the wind , for more than 10 days until a young patrolman decided to retrieve it late last night. // " Life today holds many terrors , " said the Bishop of Salisbury , the Rev. John Austin Baker . " As each new act of corruption is reported , we slip too easily into saying of the perpetrators , ' They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not madness . It is wickedness . " <> <> Evacuation Timed Exactly // The evacuation of the embassy came more than 48 hours before the Sunday midnight deadline set by the British when they broke diplomatic relations with Libya . The evacuation followed a precise timetable worked out in the middle of the night in negotiations between the two countries , and it was witnessed by observers from the Turkish , Saudi Arabian and Syrian Embassies in London. // Two British second secretaries , George Anderson and Redmond Norton , stayed in Tripoli , where they are to form a British Interests Section in the Italian Embassy . Two Libyans , whose names were not given , remained here to set up a similar office in the Saudi Embassy. // A spokesman for the Home Office said the police would not search the Libyan Embassy until after Sunday midnight , when the break in relations becomes official. // The day ' s drama began before dawn , when an armored police Range-Rover entered St. James ' s Square , just south of Piccadilly Circus . It cleared from the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s Bureau , two vehicles that were left there in the confusion after the shooting 11 days ago. <> <> 7 Men Enter the Square // Then , at 8 : 47 A.M. , seven men walked into the square from its eastern side , down Charles II Street . They were the three diplomatic observers , two Libyans who have been serving as intermediaries during the drawn-out negotiations and two other Libyans sent here this week by Colonel Qaddafi to deal with the logistics of closing the embassy. // Nearby streets were closed . Fire engines , ambulances , police reinforcements and seven green police vans with their windows blackened went into position . Marksmen atop surrounding buildings peered intently through their sights. // At 9 : 26 a somewhat battered white van bearing diplomatic license tags backed up to the embassy . It was loaded with 4 white diplomatic sacks like the 18 taken away on Thursday and about 50 pieces of hand luggage , then it drove away . Nothing was searched. // A momentary lull followed , the square silent except for the chirping of birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hovering nearby , as hundreds of policemen fidgeted tensely. // Finally at 9 : 50 a first group of five Libyans walked out , led by Muftah Fitouri , one of the intermediaries . The five walked slowly along , in single file , about three or four yards apart , and climbed into one of the green vans in adjacent Jermyn Street , which is lined with smart shops. // Five other groups of five followed , each escorted by Mr. Fitouri , the last at 11 A.M. The name of each was checked off a list . All 30 were men , and most of them wore business suits . <> <> The Motorcade Leaves // When all were in the vans , a motorcade set off to the west , led by six police motorcycles with blue lights flashing , with police cars , the green vans and diplomatic limousines behind them . Only then did a police spokesman tell waiting reporters , " The siege has ended. " // One of the two men sent by Colonel Qaddafi remained at the embassy , preparing to hand over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " safe house , " the Home Office spokesman said , the Libyans were " invited to contribute any knowledge that they have concerning the shooting of Miss Fletcher " and told to fill out routine customs and immigration forms . The questioning took place at the Civil Service College at Sunningdale , Berkshire , 16 miles southwest of London , near Windsor and lasted more than six hours. // Early in the evening they were taken to Heathrow Airport , 12 miles away , where they boarded their flight . It took off at 7 : 48 P.M. // Matooq Matooq , the final member of the four-man " revolutionary committee " that took over the People ' s Bureau in February , was deported a few hours after the embassy was cleared . He was not inside when the siege began and was arrested on Tuesday . The three other members are already in Libya. // //
