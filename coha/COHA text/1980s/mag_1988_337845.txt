Maher Abaza , Egypt 's Minister of Energy , sits in semidarkness in his cavernous Cairo office , the only light a small desk lamp and neon bulbs overhead . " This is a very hard year for our country 's power system , " he explains . " I have told the Egyptian people clearly  --  we do not have enough . " At the Aswan High Dam , Supervisor Hamdi el Shaffei observes , " Water is our fuel . Not a drop is wasted . " Under his feet , huge turbines hum as thousands of gallons of precious Nile River water gush past each second , heading north on the last leg of a 4,150-mile journey through Africa . <P> Living virtually without rain in a country that is 97% desert , Egyptians depend on the world 's longest river for irrigation , electric power , drinking water and transportation . Now , after a decade of drought that has left parts of central Africa on the brink of starvation , the Nile is running perilously low . For the first time since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water and hydroelectric power threaten Egypt . <P> By midsummer , government officials predict , the water level in the reservoir above Aswan , known as Lake Nasser , will drop to 492 ft. , from 574 ft. a decade ago , slashing power output by 55% and causing isolated power shortages . If the level dips much below that , Aswan 's powerful turbines , which provide 25% of Egypt 's electricity , must be shut down , crippling industrial development and hampering efforts to reclaim desert land for cultivation . <P> The impending crisis was not officially acknowledged until last December , after a government-commissioned study by British consultants warning of dire water and power shortages was leaked to the press . The sense of urgency increased last month when officials decided to save water by adding an extra week to the dam 's annual 21-day maintenance period , when water flow is sharply reduced . The results downstream were dramatic : parts of the Nile 's muddy bottom in Cairo were exposed for the first time , and tourist boats cruising between Aswan and Luxor suddenly confronted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing dependence on the Nile reflects growing industrialization , as well as profligate habits of consumption . Since 1981 , use of electricity has soared from 18 billion to 45 billion kw-h . To curb demand , the government in the past five years has quadrupled the price of electricity for heavy users , although electricity for the poor is still subsidized . " We can not pressure the poor , " says Energy Minister Abaza with a shrug . <P> In recent months the Egyptian government has quietly begun instituting measures to save water . Since October , outflow from the Aswan dam has been reduced by more than 10% ; irrigation water that once flooded more than 250,000 acres of rice fields , or 25% of Egypt 's total production , has been cut off . To cope with the anticipated decrease in hydroelectricity , the government plans to add four new gas- and oil-fired electric generating plants to Egypt 's overtaxed power system in the next year . Cost : $300 million .                @ @ @ @ @
