A pain in the neck for a lame duck in St. Cloud , Minn. , is about to end . An elusive mallard , hobbled since May by a dart embedded in its neck , finally was captured on the Mississippi River , thanks to Les Hubbell , who refused to give up . Every day at 5 : 30 a. m. for three months , Hubbell drove to the river with a chicken-wire trap and pieces of corn . The breakfast was just ducky , but " Donald " wouldn ' t bite . Over the weekend , Donald finally waddled in . " Sooner or later , I knew he was going to step in there , " said Hubbell , who will take the wounded bird to a veterinarian Monday for removal of the 5- inch dart . Then he plans to nurse the duck back to health before releasing it . ANOTHER LAME DUCK SMOOTHS HIS FEATHERS Nearing retirement from Capitol Hill is the " Prince of Pork , " Rep. Kenneth J. Gray ( D. , Ill. ) , who wants to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who introduced Elizabeth Ray to House colleagues . Gray hired the famous " I-can ' t-type " secretary in 1972 . Four years later , she scuttled the political career of Ohio Democrat Wayne Hays with testimony about amorous services , including some allegedly performed on Gray ' s lavish houseboat , the Roll Call . Gray still maintains " it ' s a bum rap " and says he fired Ray in 1973 . He wants to be remembered for something else , anyhow . " I ' ve always been called the Prince of Pork , and I wear that label proudly , " said Gray , 63 , who estimates bringing $7 billion in federal projects to his depressed coal-mining district during his 24 years in the House . A frizzy-haired , bow-tied amateur magician and ex-car dealer , Gray won 12 terms in Congress with pork barrel legislation and folksy humor . ( Among them : " Times are so bad down in Southern Illinois that the creeks are running only three days a week . " ) As for retirement : " I ' ve got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States and see a lot of places I haven ' t been to . " YO ! SYLVESTER : WHERE ' S YOUR APPETITE ? The pepperoni pizza delivered to the doorstep of Sylvester Stallone had something missing . That ' s because Jerry Rubin finally ended his 63-day liquid- only fast . Rubin had stopped eating three months ago to dramatize a campaign against war toys and film violence-one day for each million dollars spent on " Rambo III . " He observed a return to doughy goodness by hand- delivering a pizza 3 feet in diameter to the Malibu , Calif. , home of the nation ' s resident advocate of patriotic gore . Sly wasn ' t available , but a housekeeper accepted the gift-which had dropped to the pavement en route and had one bite missing , anyhow . Said Rubin afterward : " In 10 or 20 years , we ' re going to pay a sad price , because these films not only have a negative effect on children , but they have a negative effect on everyone . " A RING OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brent Justensen found a diamond ring while cleaning a sewer line near Angel Street . " I saw the band stuck into the grit , so I pulled it out and cleaned it off , " Justensen said . Several jewelers who examined the ring estimated its value at between $800 and $1 , 200 . Did he keep it ? No way . Justensen , 24 , returned to Angel Street and began knocking on doors , finally ending up on the doorstep of Ann Hill , who had been given the ring by her husband years ago . " It was just like a dream , " said Hill , who had abandoned hope . Hill said she was stunned , not by the discovery , but by Justensen ' s honesty : " In this age , you just don ' t see that many examples of it . It ' s a wonderful thing to know we have people like this in the world . " A BUMPY RIDE , BUT A SATISFYING ENDING Honesty is the best policy in Shawn Trepanier ' s books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wis. , hit a bump while cycling and looked back to find a wallet , inside of which was $225 in cash and several credit cards . Said Shawn , 14 , an 8th grader at Franklin Middle School : " It ' s just not my money . I didn ' t earn it ; somebody else did . " He returned it . . . to a 74-year-old man from Waukesha . WANTED : A MIRACLE OR A GUILTY CONSCIENCE Meanwhile , there ' s hope at a Franciscan Monastery in Kennebunkport , Me. , where 20 priests and seminarians are praying for the safe return of the remains of St. Anthony , 13th Century patron saint of lost articles . Someone stole a bronze and glass case containing his remains from a statue of the saint in the chapel . STAMP OUT JUNK MAIL ?
