<P> Stealing the Aga Khan 's prize <P> <P> It was after dark in the County Kildare countryside 30 miles southwest of Dublin , and Jim Fitzgerald 's family had just finished dinner when there was a knock at the door . In burst five or more men , all masked and waving guns . Fitzgerald 's wife and five of his children were herded together and locked in a back room . Fitzgerald , 55 , head groom at nearby Ballymany Thoroughbred stud farm , was ordered to lead the gunmen to the stable of a certain five-year-old bay stallion . <P> Scared and a bit dazed , the horseman looped a bridle over the docile animal , then led him into the gang 's horse trailer . Fitzgerald was ordered to lie face down in another van , from which he was freed an hour and at least 40 miles later . But by then the most acclaimed and valuable Thoroughbred in Europe , Shergar , was gone , horsenaped . " It was very neat , " said a policeman of the caper . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investors put up $457,000 apiece for the horse , which was expected to earn $4 million or more a year in stud fees for 15 to 20 years . The thieves knew the breeding business . The four-month stud season begins this week ; the first dozen of Shergar 's 55 mates , each in season for a month , are already at Ballymany , ready and expensively waiting . <P> But just who has Shergar ? There were several anonymous claimants . The first telephone caller the next morning demanded 2 million , presumably Irish pounds ( $2.76 million ) , and a later one just 40,000 ( $55,200 ) . Other callers said Shergar was dead already , destroyed after an accidental eye injury . Inevitably , there was conjecture about Irish Republican Army involvement . <P> The criminals ' intention was probably to offer the horse for ransom . Shergar would be practically impossible to sell . He would be hard enough to keep hidden . The Thoroughbred requires unusual amounts of exercise , since he has lately been on a special , high-energy diet in anticipation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other day . Yet allowing him outdoors in the winter cold would be risky for the horse and horsenapers . His coat could be dyed : Shergar has white feet and a striking white blaze running the length of his face . But the stallion also has an unusual and unalterable amount of white in the left eye . Declared the daily Irish Independent : " At least one-third of Ireland would know him on sight . " <P> Shergar was bred , raised and raced by the Aga Khan , 46 , who retains 15% ownership and owns the $2.3 million Ballymany stud farm as well . In a two-season European career beginning in 1980 , Shergar won six of his eight races , including the Irish and English Derbies , by impressive margins . He was voted Europe 's Racehorse of the Year in 1981 . The Aga Khan reportedly turned down a $30 million purchase offer from an American for Shergar . The eventual $18.3 million price is the fourth highest in breeding history . <P> <P> Because combining proven bloodlines is the point in breeding , buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sure thing as there is in horse racing . According to one British breeder , the price of Shergar 's stud service was $46,200 in advance plus $46,200 more after conception . Last year all but two of Shergar 's mares were successfully impregnated .
