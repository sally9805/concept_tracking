The Reagan Administration 's attempts to stanch the flow of technology to the Soviet Union , primarily directed at the shipment of computers , microelectronics and software , have also involved efforts to prevent publication or open discussion of certain unclassified technical research  --  a policy that has angered many scientists . Yet there is growing evidence to , support Washington 's concern . In an exclusive interview with TIME 's Frank Melville in London , a former officer in the GRU , the Kremlin 's military intelligence agency , has affirmed the fact that acquiring American high technology is the agency 's No. 1 priority . Other comments of this recent defector , whose identity is being guarded by British intelligence : <P> Spying directed at finding out the enemy 's order of battle is no longer necessary  --  it is all set out for the Soviet high command to read in the military balance sheets published by organizations such as Jane 's and the International Institute for Strategic Studies , and in Flight International magazine and the International Defense Review . Even knowing the strategic plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German plain is not all that important . What really interests the Soviets is such things as clues to laser components in systems for navigating nuclear submarines underwater , the guidance mechanisms of antitank missiles , and the engine air filters you put into battle tanks . The fact is that military technology has become the main espionage battlefield . <P> The Soviet Union can launch the first satellite , the first astronaut in space and the Second World War-winning T-34 tank , but it is behind  --  perhaps as much as a decade  --  in high-tech avionics , guidance systems and the whole range of electronics . But the Soviet designer is not stupidly proud . If someone has a better idea than he does , he accepts it . And that is what GRU activities in the West are all about . <P> Military intelligence sends to Moscow everything Soviet technology can not make . They concentrate their efforts on the large number of smaller supplier firms working for major companies like Aerospatiale or British Aircraft Corp . We go after suppliers who are not so aware of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a plane or a missile ) . <P> What is Moscow 's current priority for GRU ? The plate covering the U.S. shuttle vehicle through the enormous temperatures is one  --  how to connect ( the tiles ) with the metal . That the GRU would very much like to know about . <P> I think about half the achievement in Soviet military power has been very heavily influenced by the West . I speak about Soviet tanks , antitank missiles , antiaircraft missiles , aircraft and submarines . Sometimes you see a Soviet tank and it 's a genuine Soviet tank . But inside you can see the stabilizers for the tank guns , night vision , communications equipment and engines that owe their existence to Western technology . <P> In one instance , a lot of money was used to bribe some German technicians in order to acquire a ( West German ) Leopard tank . The question was how to get the engine to the U.S.S.R. The solution was for the Soviet consul in the area to buy a yacht and have its engine taken out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendezvoused several miles out to sea with a Soviet merchant ship , to which the engine was transferred .
