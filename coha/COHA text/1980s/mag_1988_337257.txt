Since last April , several hundred Americans have picked an unlikely vacation spot : Viet Nam . Among the travelers on one recent package tour was Paul Witteman , TIME 's San Francisco bureau chief . A report on his adventures follows : <P> The photos in the travel brochure promise exotic scenes of rare beauty : coarse sand beaches curve seamlessly toward the horizon ; delicate , silk-draped women smile alluringly . But upon landing at an eerily empty Tan Son Nhut airport , there is no escaping the stark reminders of conflicts past : the olive-drab Chinook helicopters , C-130s and C-47s lie cheek by cowl off the tarmac . This is no Club Med . This , ladies and gentlemen , is the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam , a recent and tentative entrant in the lucrative global sweepstakes known as the tourist industry . <P> A trip to Viet Nam is not for everyone . But for those who choose to go , there are infrequent flights from San Francisco on Philippine Airlines . Others may trickle in via Bangkok . " The business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tour and promotions manager in the U.S. " We fought the French and they visit , " observes Tour Guide Nguyen Viet Hai of the government tourism office in Saigon . " Why not the Americans ? " <P> The mix of intrepid voyagers usually includes returning U.S. veterans and naturalized American citizens , born in Viet Nam . " It 's nice , flying into Saigon , not having to sit on a flak jacket , " says Bob Handy , 55 , of Santa Barbara , Calif. , who served a year in Chu Lai with the Marines . " I 'm going back because it 's a beautiful country . " Like most of her fellow Vietnamese- born travelers , Tran Thi Thuc , 49 , a health-care worker from Kalamazoo , Mich. , was hoping to visit relatives . " I have not seen my mother since 1975 , " she says , recalling a hasty departure with her husband and two children the week before Saigon 's collapse . Tearful reunions outside the terminal at Tan Son Nhut now occur regularly , although many returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manila-based Tour Operator Johnathan Nguyen , a naturalized American , offers reassurances . " Overseas Vietnamese , welcome back , " he exclaims at a briefing session during a stopover in the Philippines . " You will be treated like a king with your dollars . " <P> Nguyen 's highly organized tours , planned with the enthusiastic cooperation of the Hanoi government , begin in teeming Saigon . Arriving there in the " high season "  --  the relatively dry period from November to May  --  can pose a few logistical problems . Travelers from the Soviet Union and East bloc countries , seeking a winter refuge , come in droves . As current allies , they have the clout to book the downtown hotels , while Americans are often relegated to the Tan Binh , a tedious , hour-long pedicab ride from downtown 's central market . Among the scant diversions of the place : tasty , small loaves of French bread , pint bottles of dreadful Vietnamese vodka and a nearby tennis club . For a pack of American cigarettes , the local pro will cheerfully run you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
