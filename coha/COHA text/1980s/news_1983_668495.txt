For the past few months , we have been subjected to a comic strip called " Conrad , " the tedious tale of the impending marriage of a cigar-smoking frog to a fat princess . We are supposed to delight in the possibility that the frog is enchanted and will turn into a prince . In reality , we are repulsed by overt suggestions of bestiality and by the artist ' s obsession with the frog ' s long tongue . There ' s more not to enjoy . The frog talks as either Groucho Marx or George Burns would talk if Groucho Marx or George Burns never had anything funny to say . And we see a lot of Fido the alligator , a pet that continually swallows the frog . If you do not read " Conrad , " you may wonder why I have been unable to grasp the humor . If you do read " Conrad , " you ' ll understand that there is no humor . " Conrad " has broken the comic industry record , previously held by " Mutt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About 110 newspapers nationwide are running " Conrad , " which tells me why so many newspapers nationwide are going out of business . " Conrad " is distributed by the Tribune Co . Syndicate , whose editor , Don Michel , says " Conrad " is doing very well , so well that anthologies are being prepared and " Conrad " toys are under consideration . Last month , The Globe printed four letters from readers begging for an end to " Conrad . " I almost always disagree with anything written in a letter to the editor , but in this case I disagree only with feminists who are not looking past their waistlines . The fat feminists say the fat princess is an insult to fat women . They should realize that " Conrad " insults everyone . If frogs could write , they would be sending in letters asking why " Conrad " hasn ' t been croaked . Perhaps I am being unfair to " Conrad .

Driscoll is a man of demonstrated ability , a wizard with the written word , as far as I can tell , but his judgment in comics is suspect . He admits that as a boy he never stood for hours in pharmacies or magazine stores reading comic books until he was thrown out by the owner . " I think that ' s cheating , " Driscoll said . " I think you should pay for what you read . " No kid I knew ever had enough money to buy all the comic books he wanted to read . I can not believe that I or any of my friends , those of us who read 10 comic books for every one we bought , would ever have made the decision to replace the estimable " Kudzu " with the execrable " Conrad .

I also cherished Uncle Dub , winner of the Nobel Prize for auto mechanics . Since " Kudzu " still appears in The Sunday Globe , it is possible to compare the strips . Yesterday , Kudzu was in the fields hunting , trying to explain to Uncle Dub " the sheer stunning majesty of nature ' s handiwork . " Uncle Dub responded by firing both barrels of his shotgun at a bird flying overhead . Sure , it was a predictable punch line , but at least it was poignant commentary . Conrad was eaten by the alligator again . What a knee-slapper . I don ' t know if anything can be done about " Conrad , " the lowest form of humor since the whoopee cushion . Letters have failed . Pleas to the executive editor have failed . We can always hope that " Conrad " self-destructs . Since the fat princess likes to eat all the time , maybe she ' ll develop a taste for frog ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
