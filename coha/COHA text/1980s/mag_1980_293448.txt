Life being what it is , " said Baudelaire , " one thinks of revenge . " Americans found themselves thinking about it a little more than usual last week as they watched Iranians displaying charred American bodies in front of the Tehran embassy that the dead had been sent to liberate . They thought of it again when Moussavi Garmoudi , the Iranian President 's " cultural affairs adviser , " appeared before cameramen , reached into a box and brought out a burned human foot ( American ) , which he laid on a table before them . <P> Such scenes open a little trap door at the base of the brain . From that ancient root cellar they summon up dark , flapping fantasies of revenge . During the six-month imprisonment of their hostages , Americans have on the whole reacted with a surprising forbearance toward the Iranians . But beneath the surface they have marinated in an odd , atavistic cross-cultural rage . Their anger has been ripened by the long spectacle of their nation 's ineffectuality and the humiliation of the failed rescue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumping their fists in the air and screaming death threats in Farsi , and by the image of Sadegh Ghotbzadeh 's cretinous smirk . Dark impulses that normally stay below , like Ahab 's harpooners , begin to straggle up on deck . <P> If aggression is the most basic and dangerous of human impulses , revenge gains a step on it by being premeditated . The urge for lurid , annihilating retaliation-vindication , satisfaction , the no-good bastard 's head upon a plate-fetches far back to a shrouded moment when the spontaneous animal reflex of self-protection turned to a savage brooding . The human mind , newly intelligent , began to dream of the barbarously fitting ways in which it would get even . Emanating from hurt and the pain of failure and unfairness , the fantasy of revenge became , it may be , even stronger than the imperative of sex . <P> The gods of man 's myths were elaborately , even bizarrely , vengeful . In the Inferno , Dante 's Deity was satanically inventive in making the vengeance fit the crime . The best tragic theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst has been built around the deep urge to settle someone 's hash . In an orgy of horrific finality and emotional overstatement , Medea murders her two sons and hurls their corpses at Jason . That , God knows , ought to teach him . <P> History has been just as imaginative as theater and myth . The South American Tupinamba tribe would take a prisoner of war , make him consort with a woman of their tribe , then allow the woman to bear a child so that they could increase the tragedy by slaughtering both the prisoner and his baby . Sometimes in New Zealand , when a chieftain was killed during a war between two tribes , hostilities were broken off while the body of the leader was chopped up by his opponents , roasted and devoured . Among the southern Slavs a mother has been known to ay her infant son down in the cradle to sleep upon the bloodstained shirt of his murdered father . The child was raised to avenge ; it became his vocation .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
