Succeeding him at the house that has long epitomized French fashion : Milanese designer Gianfranco Ferre , 45 . Dior 's managing director , Beatrice Bongibault-Dhjan , implied that Bohan 's departure was sort of his idea . Said she : " It was elegant of Bohan to know when to leave . " <P> Mais non , said Bohan . In an interview with Figaro , he claimed that the changeover had come as a terrible blow . French couturiers were irked that Dior had not chosen a replacement from the ranks of Gallic designers . In fact , Dior is getting ready for the hot competition that will result from European unification in 1992 . In the past decade Ferre has won numerous prizes for sophisticated ready-to-wear clothing that might sell better in the broader market than Bohan 's classical creations .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
