" Mother , " said Amy Wels , " do n't do that to me . " <P> Marguerite Wels tugged at the bodice of her daughter 's bridal gown . " Thank God , " she said . " It 's better than anything else we 've looked at . But it will have to come in here . " <P> Hold the joy for the ceremony . This is just part of a long , tough job . " Amy is such a skinny thing . So flat-chested , " Marguerite has explained . " Nothing looked right . " So Mother left her Park Avenue apartment in Manhattan and , with daughter in tow , journeyed to Bay Ridge in Brooklyn , where she found Kleinfeld 's and , at last , a suitable wedding dress . <P> " I 've dragged her all over New York , " says Marguerite , as Amy wends her way back to the fitting room . " This is hardest for the mother . I ca n't wait until she goes back to San Francisco tomorrow . Amy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lived on a commune . I never thought I would see the day . This boy has really changed her . Now she wants a fancy wedding dress . " <P> Kleinfeld 's , an establishment approximately the size of a private airport , sees a lot of Amys  --  more , it seems , than ever before . A hundred potential brides drop in every day , and 150 on Saturdays . A staff of 100 brings in samples from a stock of some 800 model bridal gowns , averaging $1,200 in price and topping out around $10,000 . " Every girl is special , beautiful , " insists Owner Hedda Kleinfeld Schapter . " These are custom dresses for noncustom $ people . How could a career girl come in here wearing Perry Ellis and accept anything less ? " <P> Hedda and her husband Jack accepted more than $10 million in revenue for their store last year , which includes a bridesmaids shop two blocks away to which customers are shuttled by limo . " The bridesmaid is such an underdog , " Hedda explains . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridesmaids everywhere may be brooding over reports that the marriage rate for eligible women ages 15 to 44 has dropped to the lowest level ever recorded : for each 1,000 women , there are fewer than 100 weddings each year . Not even the Kleinfeld 's limo can ride over a sobering stat like that . <P> There is no gloom at Kleinfeld 's , however , or anywhere else in the wedding industry . Everyone , in fact , seems downright delirious  --  from the usual near- frantic nuptial logistics and from unconcealed fiscal rapture . In 1985 , according to Bride 's magazine , which takes proprietary pride in such things , the industry raked in $10.9 billion ( including money spent on gifts and other wedding bounty ) , up 43% in the past decade . Manhattan 's swank Pierre Hotel has seen a 20% increase in its wedding business over the past five years . Many couples are opting for " weekend weddings " : multi-event affairs that stretch the ceremonies and attendant celebrations into a three-day party . VIP Fantasy Locations in Marina del Ray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rentals of its 88-ft. yacht , Sundowner . An " Affordable Fantasy " on- board wedding is $5,500 , and a " Cloud Nine " prices out at $9,999 , which includes the cost of 99 white pigeons sent heavenward at an appropriately celebratory moment . Do n't call about next week , though . The ship is booked solid until October .
