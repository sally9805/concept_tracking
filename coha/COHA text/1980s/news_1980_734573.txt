txt WITH ALL OF Illinois ' regular hunting seasons now closed , the only hunting available with the exception of predator bunting is for pheasants , chukar partridge and quail at the state 's privately owned shooting preserves . Illinois has more than 100 state-licensed , regulated hunting preserves , and they 're scattered all over the state . Not all of the state 's hunting preserves operate exactly the same , nor do they all offer the same kinds of hunting . Many preserves , for example , no longer give any " flighted " mallard shooting , or bobwhite quail or chukar hunting . And those that do have duck shooting  --  which usually is pass shooting at released mallards  --  generally run out of ducks not long after the preserve season opens . A major difference in Illinois ' hunting preserves is whether they are private , for members only , or open to the public for " daily fee " hunting . The majority of the state 's gunning clubs are members-only affairs . YEARS AGO the shooting preserve season in Illinois opened on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season was extended to March 31 . Now , because there have been many harsh winters and times when preserves all but closed down . because of bad weather . the season has been lengthened considerably . It starts now Oct. 1 , and runs through April 30 . Because of generally mild weather this fall and winter , many shooting preserves are running out of birds early . " A lot of hunters have been coming out to our place Duke Haven Game Club , neat . ' , and I suppose to other clubs , too . " said Bill Fortino , host at Duke Haven , " because we 've had such favorable hunting weather . But the bird supply isrunning thin , and I know many clubs already are out of quail . I was lucky , and recently purchased 1,000 bobwhites , but they wo n't last long . " ? heasants are the easiest of game birds to raise , along with mallards , so most clubs generally have a lot more ringnecks than any other game . A few shooting areas claim to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting , but they seldom if ever are " wild " birds . MOST MAJOR shooting preserves raise their own pheasants and ducks , although a lot nowadays are leaving the rearing of birds to others and purchase them in late summer . Many clubs usually must purchase several thousand birds from other breeders late in the season when their supply runs low . Not many Illinois shooting preserves raise their own quail . Quail are difficult to hatch and rear profitably in great numbers in Illinois , chiefly because of the generally bitter winters . Bobwhite is a " southern " bird , and he survives best where there 's more magnolia around than there is spruce and hemlock . There is no bag limit on the number of birds a hunter may bag at a shooting preserve . Ail that restricts your shooting is the weight of your wallet . Cock or hen birds of any kind may be taken at game clubs , and usually prices are the same for bens or cocks , although a few clubs might charge around $I more for cocks than they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but today most shooting preserves get around $0. $10 for pheasants , $5-$6 for chukars , and $44.5 for quail . Those are state-wide averages , lower . Hunters costs at any particular club may be much higher or much Hunters generally are encouraged to bring their own dogs to shooting preserves , but most clubs will provide dogs is well as a handler or " guide . " Many preserves require that hunters be accompanied by a guide whether or not they want one . A guide will see that a hunt is properly " managed , " that hunting safety is practiced , that dogs are handled correctly , and that game bagged is accounted for financially . SPORTSMEN WHO own their own bird dogs are the ones who get the most enjoyment out of hunting preserves . Game is never in short supply , so both the hunter and his dog can get a thorough workout . And there are no better places to train young dogs , to keep an experienced dog " sharp , " or to teach a youngster hunting safety and courtesy . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says here , thousands of sportsmen fairly flock to shooting preserves ? partimearly in late winter , when all the regular seasons have dosed.
