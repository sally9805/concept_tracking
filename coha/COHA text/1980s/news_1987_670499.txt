" A lot of Japanese institutions are sitting on mega-profits , " said Gavin Dobson , vice president of the Chicago-based Kemper International Fund , who noted that the stocks traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 99. 7 percent last year , in dollar terms . " When they look around the world at what to do with them , the U.S. market is screaming at them. " // Foreign investment , which soared by $25 billion last year , against an increase of $4. 9 billion in 1984 , could near $20 billion more in the first three months of this year alone , according to some investment managers . And that is good news for the market. // " While foreigners account for a small minority of overall trading , their heavy buying could have contributed greatly to the surge in January and February , " said Richard McCabe , manager of the market analysis department at Merrill Lynch . <> <> Optimism on U.S. Economy // But while Japanese institutions are the major new foreign force in the market , traditional foreign investors from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Middle East , have all played their part . American stocks look inexpensive to many foreign investors because the decline of the dollar against their currency has allowed them to get more for their money . In addition , many investors believe that the American economy is likely to grow faster than those of the other industrial nations. // Investors have also noted that most stock exchanges outperformed the United States market last year , with the international average rising 43. 1 percent , while the 500 American stocks that make up the Standard &; Poor ' s index rose just 18. 6 percent. // Investors in nations such as France , where stocks rose 54 percent last year , and Britain , where shares rose 24. 5 percent , suspect that Wall Street has some catching up to do. // Most important , perhaps , is the growing belief that the dollar ' s decline is largely over , which would protect the value of new dollar investments . Investors such as the Swiss banks had pared their dollar portfolios down to perhaps 5 percent of equities as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of Essex Investment Management Company of Boston . They have at times held up to 20 percent of their equities in American shares , and may step up investments sharply as soon as they are convinced that the dollar has stabilized . <> <> ' Still Scared ' // " The Europeans haven ' t participated to a great degree yet because they are still scared about the currency , " agreed Felix Zulauf , global strategist for the Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich . " Potentially , there ' s a lot more money that could flow in to the United States. " // The backdrop to all of these considerations is that investors around the world have an unprecedented amount of money at their disposal , and fewer restrictions than ever on where they can put it . Fixed-income securities , such as savings bonds , remain the most popular form of financial investment , but mind-boggling sums are " leaking " into stocks as interest rates drop. // " From economic and political perspectives , you could argue that foreign investors have little or no choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Salomon Brothers Inc. // Analysts caution that it is impossible to determine how much of the recent run-up in stock prices occurred because of foreign bullishness . Most of the buying power in the market comes from American investors , including fund managers who have switched funds back to the domestic market from overseas for the same reasons foreign investors are buying American shares . <> <> Japanese Like the Blue Chips // By all accounts , the most dramatic change in the foreign investment scene is the sudden emergence of the Japanese . Their initial buying concentrated on blue-chip giants such as General Motors , I.B.M. , Coca-Cola , Du Pont , McDonald ' s and Merck. // Japan ' s diversification from United States bonds into stocks has been encouraged by a relaxation last year of laws that limited overseas equities investment. // American stocks have come in for particular attention because fund managers believe they are undervalued in comparison to their Japanese counterparts . Marshall Front , senior partner at the investment management firm of Stein , Roe &; Farnham , said that Japanese investors were concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an average of 35 times earnings - compared with less than 15 times earnings for American manufacturers. // Brokers and investment managers believe that Japanese equity investment have jumped from several hundred million dollars a year to more than $5 billion a month . The next step , they say , will be a branching into smaller growth and technology stocks such as those traded over-the-counter in the United States. // Those smaller stocks have long attracted European investors , whose presence in the American market dates back to the 19th century. // European investors have joined the Japanese in the current rush to American stocks for many of the same reasons . " We are going from being underweighted to being slightly overweighted in U.S. stocks , " said Carol Biggart , investment manager for more than $5 billion in funds at Glasgow-based Murray Johnstone Ltd . <> <> Dollar Looked Cheap , but Steady // Ms. Biggart began to build up her investments in American and Canadian shares to more than $800 million in the last three months of 1986 because the dollar looked cheap , but steady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American companies would have growing exports. // Another sudden dip in the dollar or the arrival of a bear market on Wall Street might quickly change these views . But experts say that there is also a possibility that new forces could accelerate the foreign investment trend. // One case cited by Mr. Hale : Taiwan , which has larger foreign currency reserves than either Japan or West Germany , might relax rules barring their investment in foreign stocks . Such a move could come before the end of the year , he said , and could send billions of dollars more into American stocks. //
