Michael S. Dukakis yesterday formally declared his intent to seek the job he lost to Gov . Edward J. King in 1978 with a pledge to change the style and direction of state government . " The 1982 election presents a fundamental choice as to what kind of state government we want in Massachusetts , " he said before an enthusiastic crowd of more than 1000 supporters at Boston ' s historic Faneuil Hall . In a thematic speech that deliberately steered clear of specific program proposals , the Democratic candidate called for a state government founded on " integrity , competence , compassion and effectiveness . " Dukakis ousted former governor Francis W. Sargent in 1974 and served one term . King beat him in the Democratic primary four years ago . Dukakis referred cryptically to the " painful lessons " of the 1978 election and described the upcoming election as " one of the most important gubernatorial elections this state will ever hold . " He never mentioned by name his Democratic opponents , King and Lt. Gov . Thomas P. O ' Neill 3d , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present approach to government . " Instead of bringing us together , they would divide us against each other - person against person , group against group , community against community , legislature against executive , " he said . " It is the politics of empty promises and empty rhetoric . It is the approach of talking tough , then blaming somebody else for failures . It is promising businesslike management , and then making cronyism the order of the day on Beacon Hill , " he said . Although he avoided specifics in his formal speech , Dukakis promised to earmark 40 percent of the growth in state revenues to local aid for cities and towns during a brief press conference afterwards . " The most important single thing we have to do is make Proposition 2 1/2 work , " he said . " That means making the commitment to share state revenue growth with cities and towns . " Proposition 2 1/2 forced cities and towns to reduce property taxes , the major source of revenue for municipalities . Last year the Legislature and King hotly struggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favored returning less than the $265 million in new assistance eventually approved by the legislature . The sub-theme of state aid to municipalities , a priority during Dukakis ' tenure as governor , ran throughout his remarks yesterday . For example , he said adequate levels of police protection must be maintained . " The first line of defense is a well trained and effective police force out there visible and enforcing the law , " he said . To maintain those public safety levels , the state must provide sufficient assistance to cities and towns he said . The speech played on Dukakis ' perceived strengths by stressing the themes of integrity , competence , compassion and effectiveness . He promised to implement the Ward Commission recommendations on curbing abuse and misconduct in the awarding of state contracts . " The real test of an administration ' s commitment to integrity is the way it responds to evidence of corruption at any level and fulfills its responsibility to root it out , " he said . At the same time , the speech faced head-on his perceived weaknesses and King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development . He tried to turn those potential negative issues into positive ones for him by recalling successes of his administration . He also chided the King approach to crime . " Is there anyone who thinks . . . that all the political hot air on crime coming out of the governor ' s office these days is making us more secure in our daily lives ? " he asked . And he contrasted the " effectiveness " of his economic development program to King ' s . " We didn ' t do that with slogans and bumper stickers . We did it by bringing fiscal responsibility back to state government , " he said , alluding to King ' s " Make it in Massachusetts " promotional campaign . He stressed the importance to Massachusetts of good roads , transit systems , housing , public education and downtown revitalization to build the state ' s economy . The speech also included many personal anecdotes , an apparent attempt to " warm " the former chief executive ' s frosty image as arrogant and aloof . Dukakis waxed nostalgic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts and Boston and recalled wandering through the North End as a boy pretending to be Johnny Tremain , the apprentice to Paul Revere . The chatty almost conversational tone represents a stylistic departure for the former chief executive . Dukakis , however , showed signs of the " old Dukakis " when he recounted an anecdote of a woman approaching him in the aisle of a supermarket where " I was looking over the specials . " The crowd dissolved with laughter at the reference to his notorious parsimony . Asked his view of the tax proposal made by Lt. Gov . O ' Neill on Saturday , Dukakis said he considered it premature to address the question of taxes . " If there is anything I learned , it is until you get into that office and see the books it is impossible to plan ahead , " he said . O ' Neill proposed to increase the state sales tax in order to lower the state income tax and increase local aid to cities and towns . Dukakis made a " lead pipe guarantee " against new taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge deficit from Sargent , Dukakis was forced to propose the heftiest tax package in Massachusetts history . When Dukakis entered the hall to a standing ovation he quipped , " This sounds like more like an inauguration than an announcement . "
