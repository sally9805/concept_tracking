Barbara Mandrell 's career has come full circle . What began in a choir loft in a small Pentecostal church soon will culminate with the release of her first gospel album . Nothing  --  neither a bout with chronic laryngitis nor a nonstop schedule of concert and TV commitments  --  could prevent her from completing the album . Her only regret is that its release comes a year past her goal . " I 've wanted to do this for so long , " she explains . " 1 had hoped to have it done before my grandmother died , but she passed away last summer at age 94 . I 'm glad she was able to see a few of the TV shows . " And , in accordance with the wishes of the show 's star , each week 's edition of " Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters " closes with a four- or five-song medley of foot-stomping , toe-tapping gospel music , the same kind of upbeat inspirational songs she and her family used to perform at churches pastored by her uncles in southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that setting is still a part of her professional life , the faith instilled during those early years also has withstood the test of time . " It 's an asset to be a Christian in show business , " she claims , nursing a Coke aboard the plush Silver Eagle tour bus that comes with the territory of a top TV-recordingconcert star . " This is such a demanding profession ; there are times when you feel like you 're going to cave in physically and emotionally . ' I 've had it , ' you say . That 's the time to turn to the Lord for strength . He knows our needs . " Her faith has always been of the practical variety , the kind that props her up when the stress level of her profession reaches pressure-cooker proportions . It provided the calm on that memorable night last year when she found herself in the uncomfortable position as cohost of the Country Music Association Awards telecast and chief contender for CM A Entertainer of the Year honors . " I was deep in prayer backstage when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew I had to go right back on camera , so I was praying I would n't look like a sore loser . " She was a winner , of course , for the second year in a row . Losing , or even coming in a close second , is probably one of the few aspects of life she has n't mastered . It 's not her fault ; she merely lacks experience . She 's a natural winner and an accomplished crowd pleaser . In fact , the last time she received a mixed review from a critic probably was in grade school when a teacher scrawled on the backside of a report card that , yes , Barbara was a good student , but she tended to be a bit , well , bossy . Always first to volunteer an answer , she preferred to do her recitation not from her chair but poised front and center before the class . She 'd make a great PTA president , the teacher suggested kindly to Mrs. Mary Mandrell during a parent-teacher conference . Then she paused and added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Instead , she opted for show business  --  a logical choice for someone who good-naturedly categorizes herself as something between a hopeless ham and an occasional show-off . " People have never scared me , " admits Barbara , some 20 years later . " When I was in a beauty contest at 16 , the girls backstage complained their hands were sweaty because they were so scared . I could n't understand or sympathize because I 'd never had butterflies . I 'd been working since I was 11 in front of the public , and it was no big deal to me . The only time I really suffered stage fright was when I was going down the aisle to be married . I told my dad , ' So this is what it feels like . . .. ' - Most of the time she resembles the calm at the center of a storm of activity . Unflappably cool , she knows she employs a first-class team of advisers that weighs each professional decision equally  --  from the dress she wears to a photo session to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced with a particularly sticky dilemma , she draws on her quiet but deep faith for the answer . " I approach everything with an absolutely positive attitude . If there 's a decision to be made and I 'm torn between two positions , I simply put it in God 's hands . I say , ' You 've got it , ' then I relax . Now , He does n't say to me in some big voice , ' Barbara , do this . ' There 's nothing strange about it ; things just begin to fall into place . " An hour before a sold-out performance in Indianapolis , she sits for her Post interview , sans stage makeup and butterflies , in svelte designer jeans , boots and tan T-shirt , looking more like the trim mother of two that she is than the glamorous superstar she becomes when the lights go down . A model of composure , she 's more concerned with everybody 's comfort aboard the bus than with the upcoming show . " Would anyone like something to eat ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft drinks , passes them around and then fusses with napkins . She insists one of her shortcomings is neatness , but as she pleads guilty to sloppiness , she simultaneously dusts tabletops and straightens pillows . " Trust me , I 'm sloppy , " she laughs . " I do n't like to clean up or wash dishes . That 's one thing that 's a little snooty about me now . For years when my son was a toddler , I did all the housework plus 200 concerts a year . Now that I can afford to have help , I do n't want to clean anymore . " Fair enough . As it is , her schedule is sufficiently frenzied to leave a less intense workaholic breathless , if not hospitalized from exhaustion . Barbara 's been both , but she bounces back quickly , more determined than ever to tackle her under-wraps " things-toaccomplish " list . Yes , she 's a goal-setter , and current priorities include her film debut sometime this year and an almost-completed gospel album , a project eagerly anticipated by fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like a well-trained athlete , she thrives on the pace and credits her father-coach Irby Mandrell with preparing her for the big time for more than 20 years . She giggles as she recounts another favorite grade-school story , one that had Irby summoned to class for a warning that Barbara 's straight-A average was in jeopardy because of a dipping math grade . Music was the culprit , according to the teacher , who reminded Mr. Mandrell that Barbara had joined the school band and choir and was practicing four hours daily and six hours on Saturdays and Sundays . " Dad asked her how I was doing in music , and she said she understood I was getting an A , " recalls Barbara . " Then he asked if I was learning enough math to figure percentages , and she said yes , she thought so . He asked if I knew how to count money , and again the answer was yes . He said , ' Good ; all I ever expected was for her to learn music , figure percentages and count money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank notes in those days , and Barbara 's budding interest was not only indulged but encouraged . Mrs. Mary Mandrell , a music teacher , had her oldest daughter squeezing chords out of an accordian before she could read . Later , when the family moved from Houston to Oceanside , California , Barbara 's repertoire expanded beyond the usual Lady-of-Spain fare and included Beatles material , pop standards and , of course , country . Irby owned a music store , so his daughter had easy access to a variety of instruments . She soon was taking hot licks on the banjo , steel and bass guitars and coaxing toe-tapping rhythm from a saxophone . Once , while accompanying her dad to a music trade show in Chicago , she demonstrated steel guitar to a gathering of salesmen and was signed on the spot for a booking in Las Vegas . But success was hardly of the overnight variety . Barbara did n't suddenly appear on network TV , a gorgeous , versatile singer-musician flanked on either side by a pair of lovely bookends named Louise ( on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Long before " Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters " brightened the Saturday TV doldrums , an earlier family group , The Mandrells , worked concert dates at military bases up and down the West Coast . There was Irby doing vocals , Mary on electric bass , Barbara playing a twangy steel guitar and Barbara 's future husband Ken Dudney on drums . Summer breaks included trips to camp  --  but not the arts and crafts , **25;4302;TOOLONG type . Instead , the singing , strumming Mandrells visited field hospitals and Army posts abroad . An occasional plum such as a guest shot on live , local TV gave Barbara a sample of what big time was all about . " In the beginning , I performed totally for the love of it , " she says . " Let 's face it , it 's tough to make ends meet in show business ; that 's why I tell young people that they better love it if they 're going to endure . I think it 's 20 percent talent and 80 percent determination to succeed . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but absolutely fell by the wayside because they did n't have the guts to hang in there . ' Hard to believe , even Barbara once traded center stage for kitchen duty when she put her career on the back burner to devote her abundant energy to being full-time wife to Dudney , by this time a Navy pilot stationed overseas . In a classic show-business story that 's been repeated almost as often as starlet Lana Turner 's tale of discovery at a Hollywood soda fountain , homemaker Barbara is reputed to have once cajoled her father into taking her to the Grand 01 ' Opry where , midway through the performance , she leaned over and whispered , " Daddy , if you 'll manage me , I ' d like to try to get on the other side of the microphone again . I was n't cut out to be in the audience . " So much for retirement ; a record contract was signed a few months later . Today , she 's grateful her success was so I-o-n-g in coming . Back then , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , ' I ' m going to give you a hit for your first record , ' I would have grabbed it . But it was for a reason it took me so long . It was for the right reasons . All these years have been like my university , my learning experience . Hopefully , I 'm still learning . " Credit her lengthy internship  --  those endless years of paying her dues  --  with molding her into the totally together lady she is today . If she has a flaw , it 's merely that she seems too good to be true . On a scale of one to ten , fans rank Barbara in the 12-plus bracket . So do her peers in the business and her family , which doubles as her primary support system . Irby Mandrell answers to the titles of father and manager these days ; husband Ken is her financial adviser ; her mother runs the Nashville home office , and her mother-in-law oversees a national network of fan clubs . Barbara claims her roles as wife and mother are equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she manages to he all things to all people . But do n't call her Wonder Woman . She 's heard it before and flatly rejects the label . " I 've read article after article about myself , " she says . " It 's all very flattering , but it 's just not true when writers call me some kind of superwoman . I tell my fans I 'm only a person , and there are things about me they would n't like . Name one ? It is n't easy . She claims to be keeper of one of Nashville 's hottest tempers , but it 's a trait the public never , never sees . She considers herself a public employee who has an obligation to look and act her best for the people who buy her albums , stand in line to see her in concert or tune her in on television . She 's careful never to leave a bad impression on a stranger since , chances are , she wo n't have an opportunity to correct it . Any normal outbursts of anger are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a personality that is calm and warm 99 percent of the time . " I can be fuming inside and you might catch a flicker of it in my eyes , but I doubt it . I do n't feel it 's right for me as a public person to show what is a very tiny part of me . What I mean by having a hot temper is that I 'm not like the wife in the TV sitcom who gets mad and does n't talk . This wife talks . I 'm the same way with my children . I try not to just yell in anger , but when they 've done something that merits a spanking , I spank. - If her ire is kept in check , her pet peeves occasionally bubble to the top . She objects , for instance , to people who view her impressive Mandrel ! continued from page 53 string of awards and ask , what else is there ? She 's done it all . " I cringe when I hear that . It 's simply not true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratched the surface . I have more intensity , drive and determination today than when I started , " she insists . Besides being a performer , Barbara 's an observer . She 's tracked other entertainers and their careers and recognizes the value of leaving fans wanting more . She claims there 's a difference between satisfying an audience and wearing it out . There 's also a difference between being an entertainer and being a personality , and she hopes to graduate from one to the other . " I 'm in a youth-oriented business , " she says . " I 'm hoping I have years and years left , but the fans will decide . I 'd like to be considered a personality because a personality does n't have to have a hit record or a hot television show . A personality continually draws people to Vegas , appears on Johnny Carson and does the game shows . " To achieve personality status , a performer has to have a core of totally loyal fans . Barbara does , and the loyalty works both ways . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for ailing entertainers rather than disappoint an audience and keeping concert dates herself when suffering from flu , colds and , once , viral pneumonia . She also gives freely of her time on a one-on-one basis . At various points last summer , she took six terminally ill children under her wing , visiting them in the hospital to cheer them up . They were fans , after all . " My husband said , ' You 're tired and you do n't feel well ; you do n't have to do this . ' But I did have to , because it would hurt me a whole lot more if I did n't . The most important thing I 've learned in my life  --  and I did n't learn it until just a few years ago  --  was that in order to be at peace with myself and with God I must love everyone . You ca n't ask for forgiveness if you do n't forgive others . I 'm touched very much by people . I find it hard to say no , and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm only satisfied if I feel I 've delivered the goods to the people , " she says . " I want to feel that way after every show . I try to make each concert . each record better than the last one . Usually I come up short , but every once in a while , I think , ' Well , girl , you did it tonight . You were really cooking . ' " At times like that , she 's Barbara the entertainer ... and for her talents , the public 's appetite is insatiable .
