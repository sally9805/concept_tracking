Jaguar fighters in tight formation buzzed over crowned heads , proud Presidents and starchy ambassadors . From a hill overlooking the sports stadium , mounted cannons boomed out a 21-gun salute . A 500-member band , complete with bagpipes and scores of drummers , rapped out a tattoo to which more than 1,000 arm-swinging soldiers marched , filling the morning air with the anthem of Oman 's Royal Guard : " We do not fear death . If Qaboos calls , we obey . " <P> On hand for this display was an impressive lineup of dignitaries , including Jordan 's King Hussein , Egypt 's President Hosni Mubarak , India 's Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi , Pakistan 's President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq and the Crown Princes of Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and the major gulf states . They had come to Muscat , the capital of Oman , to mark the 15th anniversary of Sultan Qaboos bin Said 's accession to power and to celebrate his transformation of Oman into a prosperous nation courted by the West for its strategic location at the Strait of Hormuz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> On the same day , ironically , another display of air power sent a more chilling message to the region . For the 40th time in four months , Iraqi Mirage F1-S jets dropped a payload of bombs on Kharg Island , where Iran loads 85% of its oil onto tankers for export . The Iraqi pummeling closed Kharg for three days ; on Friday , Iraq claimed that another attack had caused a fire at the facility . The assaults were part of a pattern of escalation in the five-year Iran-Iraq war that has already cost thousands of lives . By repeatedly attacking Kharg , the Iraqis hope to reduce if not halt the oil exports that provide the revenues needed to bankroll Iran 's war effort . A string of air attacks in September , including low-altitude buzz bombing , temporarily stopped petroleum output at the terminal . If Kharg is totally disabled , Iran has threatened to choke off traffic through the 20- to 30-mile-wide Strait of Hormuz . The U.S. has said it would interpret closure of the passage as a strategic threat . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Oman , which lies on the strait 's southern shore . An Omani naval base at Ras Masandam monitors all ship movements through the channel , while the sultanate 's fast and flashy Province-class patrol ships , each armed with eight radar-guided Exocet missiles , are on constant alert , occasionally shooing away Iranian intruders . Qaboos has also seen to it that Oman 's 21,500-man volunteer army , navy and air force do not lack for equipment . He lavishes 46% of the national budget on the military and keeps it supplied with up-to-date tanks , aircraft and weaponry . <P> More important to the U.S. is a complex 1980 agreement that grants it limited access to four strategic Omani air bases . These facilities serve as a supply and deployment base for the U.S. Central Command , formerly called the Rapid Deployment Force , should a crisis develop in the region . Washington has spent $256 million to lengthen runways , harden concrete aircraft hangars and install storage tanks capable of holding 1.1 million gal . of jet fuel at the bases . American C-141 and C-5A cargo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oman 's southeastern coast , dropping off supplies to be forwarded by helicopter to U.S. naval task-force ships in the Indian Ocean .
