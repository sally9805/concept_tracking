NEW YORK  --  Bond prices sagged yesterday after the Federal Reserve System reported a smaller-than-expected decline in the nation ' s basic money supply . The basic money measure , known as M1 , declined $500 million in the week ended Dec. 31 , erasing only a small part of a huge , $6. 8 billion jump the previous week . Moreover , other Fed figures showed sharp gains for the month of December in M1 as well as in two broader money measures , M2 and M3 . Prices of some actively traded U.S. government bonds fell about 3/8 of a point , or around $3. 75 for each $1 , 000 face amount . Most short-term interest rates edged higher . Rapid money-supply growth in the past month " dashes any hope of further Fed credit-easing moves , " said David M. Jones , an economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &; Co . Until recently , many analysts had expected the Fed to loosen its credit hold another notch , partly because they perceived the economy to be weak . But a recent government report showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Fed will hold policy stable through the first three months of the year , " said Mr. Jones . The Fed isn ' t likely to change its course " until it gets a better fix on the economy , " he added . The Fed managed to come fairly close to hitting its money-supply targets for 1984 as a whole . But all three money measures are starting out the new year above the Fed ' s tentative 1985 target bands . The basic money supply , known as M1 , increased 5% last year , as measured from the fourth quarter of 1983 . That compared with the Fed ' s 1984 target range , which had called for 4% to 8% growth . The M2 measure grew 7. 5% last year , the dead center of the Fed ' s target range of 6% to 9% . But M3 , an even wider measure , grew 10% , well above the 6%-to-9% goal . The Fed this year is seeking 4% to 7% growth in M1 , as measured from last year ' s fourth-quarter average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8. 5% in M2 and 6% to 9% in M3 . Because of the method used in calculating the targets , December is the first month in which the money supply ' s performance can be measured against the Fed ' s new goals . The latest figures showed that M1 was $1. 4 billion above the implied upper limit last month . The M2 measure was $12. 5 billion above target , while M3 was over by $12. 9 billion . Some economists say that all three yardsticks will register strong growth again this month , keeping them well above target . A few analysts even contend that rapid money growth , combined with renewed economic vigor , will prompt the Fed to tighten its credit hold soon , reversing the easy-credit stance adopted in early September . But others argue that continued low inflation will allow the Fed to keep its credit spigot open for at least another couple of months . Interest rates probably will remain close to their current levels for the next few months because economic growth is likely to be moderate , predicted Robert A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trust Co . But he sees higher interest rates in the second and third quarters , when he expects much faster economic growth that he says will prompt the Federal Reserve to adopt a tougher credit policy . Bernard Schoenfeld , a vice president and economist at Irving Trust , expects a " very strong " economic rebound this spring . He predicted that the gross national product , after adjusting for inflation , will expand the second quarter . That would compare with the government ' s initial estimate of a 2. 8% growth rate in last year ' s fourth quarter . Mr. Schoenfeld also expects the government to revise that fourth-quarter figure up to about 3. 1% to 3. 3% . But a few analysts argue that the economy is sliding into a recession and that interest rates will fall sharply over the next few months . A. Gary Shilling , who heads a consulting firm bearing his name , contends that the economy already has slumped into a mild recession that will last through the first half . That , he says , will help drag down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5% , to about 10% by midyear . Mr. Shilling predicts first-quarter GNP , adjusted for inflation , will shrink at an annual rate of 2. 1% and will decline at a 1. 3% pace in the second quarter . He expects the government to revise its fourth-quarter GNP estimate down to show either " no change or a slight decline . " The Federal Reserve estimated M1 averaged a seasonally adjusted $557. 2 billion in the Dec. 31 week , down from a revised $557. 7 billion the previous week . The prior week ' s figure was originally estimated at $557. 6 billion . Monthly figures showed that M2 rose $29. 2 billion in December , while M3 increased $33. 6 billion . The Fed said M2 averaged $2. 3755 trillion in December , compared with $2. 3463 trillion a month earlier . M3 increased to an average of $2. 989 trillion from $2. 9554 trillion . Other figures released by the Fed showed that commercial and industrial loans on the books of the 10 leading New York City banks dropped $1. 2 billion in the week ended Jan. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an annual revision by the Fed to take into account various mergers and other changes affecting these 10 banks . The drop followed a $244 million decline the previous week , bringing the total outstanding to $61. 99 billion . Commercial paper , or corporate IOUs , outstanding in the U.S. plunged about $4. 79 billion in the Jan. 2 week to a total of $233. 18 billion . A week earlier such paper decreased $519 million . Paper issued by financial companies fell $2. 21 billion in the latest week , while paper sold by nonfinancial companies declined $2. 59 billion . In the credit markets yesterday , the Treasury ' s 11 3/4% bonds due 2014 closed at 101 21/32 to yield 11. 54% . That compared with Wednesday ' s close of 102 2/32 , where the yield was 11. 49% . The government ' s 11 5/8% notes due 1994 declined to 100 16/32 from 100 29/32 , boosting the yield to 11. 54% from 11. 46% . Rates on Treasury bills rose . The latest 13-week issue closed at 7. 76% bid , up from 7. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased to 7. 97% from 7. 88% . In the new-issue market , a $150 million issue of floating-rate World Bank notes was offered to investors . The rate on the five-year notes , which were priced at 99 7/8 , will be set weekly at 0. 55 percentage point above the yield on three-month Treasury bills . They are rated triple-A by both Moody ' s Investors Service Inc. and Standard &; Poor ' s Corp . On the tax-exempt front , a $60. 7 million offering of general obligation bonds by Suffolk County , N.Y. , got off to a lackluster sales start . By some estimates , almost half the issue remained unsold among underwriters as of yesterday afternoon . The issue was priced after auction to yield from 6% in 1987 to 9. 4% in 2009 .
