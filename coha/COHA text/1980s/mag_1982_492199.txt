There is no place like the United States when it comes to fishing . Surveys indicate that one out of every eight Americans goes fishing , making it the most popular outdoor pastime in the country . People from all walks of life love to fish , and it is n't unusual to see them standing side by side casting their lines into the same stream or surf . Quite simply , there is something for everyone in fishing . Anglers who crave solitude and relaxation say that no other hobby can compare . Party-boaters , on the other hand , love the camaraderie , the chance to get together with friends and make a day of it . Some adventurous souls long to do battle with giant tuna , marlin or some other offshore species that weigh several times the angler 's weight . Others get their thrills from spotting a 12-inch trout , determining what it 's feeding on and presenting just the right fly . Deceiving the small fish into striking , then making the catch , is as great a joy as that experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100-pound tarpon . But there 's another attraction to fishing in America : the amazing number of prime locations we have here for going after all manner of catch . In nearly every part of the country , from the oceans to tiny ponds and streams , we can lay claim to some of the world 's best fishing . Of course , with all these prime locations and all those fishermen , there are problems , not the least ofwhich is finding a spot that is n't known to every sportsman or already fished out . With that in mind as I 've combed the country in my fishing travels , I 've made notes of my favorite places  --  especially abundant sites to drop a hook . What follows are my choices , spots that offer both a challenge and the chance to make a catch . I 'm not saying you 're guaranteed a trophy fish if you so much as step out into these waters , but I think you 'd be hard pressed to find anywhere better for fishing in the U.S. Southcentral Pennsylvania Trout fishermen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel almost anywhere in search of the rainbow , brookie and especially the wily brown trout . The brown is the most difficult to catch , and perhaps that is why southcentral Pennsylvania attracts so many out-of-staters who come here to test the limestone streams near Carlisle . These streams  --  Letort , Falling Springs and Big Spring  --  comprise a unique fishery . This area of the country sits on a rich shelf of underground limestone , so water seeping through the cracks and faults becomes loaded with beneficial minerals and takes on a high pH ( alkaline ) count , stimulating weed and insect growth . These streams begin in huge underground hot springs but cool down during their journey to the surface , emerging with temperature around 50 degrees and remaining below 60 year-round , even in summer . But the fishing in winter is as good as or better than during other seasons , and it is a strange sight to see trout actively feeding when the surrounding air temperature may be 30 to 40 degrees cooler than the water . In summer , the streams meander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crickets , hoppers and others  --  which often fall into the water . These large masses of protein are eagerly sought after by the browns , so a special fly pattern has been developed to imitate the land mile-wide river in Millersburg to the north . The river is rather shallow , with a bottom of limestone ledges  --  a perfect small-mouth habitat and easy to wade . This is perhaps the best spot in the U.S. to seek smallmouth exceeding five pounds . Try your skill from June through October using small jigs and plugs or popping bugs and streamer flies . Approximately 20 miles upstream from Harrisburg , the Susquehanna meets the Juniata . From that point upstream to Lewistown , nearly all of the Juniata is wadeable . It is also a superb river for boating and drift fishing . Boat ramps have been erected almost every five miles along the river , making for easy public access . West Virginia/Maryland If you like your fight with small-mouth bass , you should follow the Potomac River upstream from Harper 's Ferry , West Virginia , where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountains . From June through October , some of the best float fishing for bass can be had here . The fish are n't big , averaging eight to 12 inches , but enough three and four pounders will pounce on small jigs and plugs or popping bugs and streamer flies to make the angling well worth your while . Surface lures produce the most action in hotter months ; underwater lures work when it 's cold . Almost all of the Potomac is wadeable at this point , and much of it is paralleled by good roads on the Maryland side . Some of the best wading spots are below Shepherdstown , West Virginia ; at the Taylor 's Landing section near the Antietam Battlefield ; and at Collin Station and Little Orleans , Maryland . Western North Carolina For a trout-fishing area that is lacking in people but boasts sizable quantities of fish , try the Great Smoky Mountains of western North Carolina . This part of the country receives more than its share of rainfall year-round , which , coupled with the high elevation , makes for lush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best trout streams I knowmore than 2,000 miles of them . Asheville is an excellent base from which to explore the Great Smoky streams ; you 'll find quality accommodations and food in town . And , from mid-April through June , the mountain slopes are covered with a startling array of beautiful American wildflowers . The best time for trout fishing , regardless of where you try in this country , is from late May through July . Of course , there 's an exception to this rule : If you 're seeking trophy trout in the Western states  --  for example , Wyoming , Montana and Colorado , all prime trout-fishing areas  --  the big fish move upriver in September and October . Eastern North Carolina Bass fishing is the most popular type of angling in the U.S. , and Currituck Sound in eastern North Carolina is perhaps the best bass factory around today . Currituck is an unusual body of water , measuring about 30 miles long with an average width of about four miles and depth of one to four feet . On one side is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sandy dunes called the Outer Banks , running south from the coast of Virginia to Cape Hatteras . Currituck Sound is heavily infested with various types of aquatic plants , mainly milfoil . In fact , in midsummer and fall , the weeds are so prolific as to make the water almost invisible . But the weeds furnish life-supporting food and sanctuary for bass , and to catch them , you drop your lure or fly into any available opening . Usually , the best months to fish Currituck are May through September , when it is not unusual for an angler to catch 40 or more bass in a day . Obviously , the lures to use are designed to fish in weeds , particularly the quarter-ounce Johnson Silver minnow spoon or a plastic worm rigged with a weedless hook . Weedless popping bugs or keel flies work extremely well . Besides shielding Currituck from the Atlantic , those same sand dunes that form the Outer Banks also offer this country 's best surf fishing , and thousands of anglers flock here when the fish are moving through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park . Within these dams are vast , shallow , swampy lakes  --  called Conservation Areas 1 . 2 and 3 ? and circling each is a deep canal formed by the extraction of landfill . When the water is high , most of the year , bass roam thoughout the lakes , but they retreat to the canals in winter when the lakes dry up . Boats are allowed in the 11-foot-deep canals and can be launched at Holiday Everglades Park and Sawgrass Recreation Area ( both along State Road 27 ) , two marinas on canals that link up with the conservation-area canals . Once within the walls of the dams , use plastic worms , the Johnson Silver minnow spoon and locally available surface lures ( including the Dalton special and Devil 's horse ) . Florida Keys Undoubtedly the best light-tackle salt-water fishing in the country is tobe found in the Florida Keys . The Keys are a 150-mile-long chain of coral islands stretching from the southern tip of Florida southwest to Key West . On the ocean side are coral reefs , but on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great area to fish , There is no best time for fishing the Keys ; certain species arrive and depart throughout the years , and you can catch something any month here . The ready availability of expert guides assures you of a catch . The most sought-after big-game fish in the Keys is the tarpon , ranging from 60 to 100 pounds with an occasional catch of up to 180 pounds . They move into the lower Keys sometime in late February , then spread as far north as Islamorada , where they remain until late July , when , for some reason , they disappear until February . Offshore , the sailfishing is best late in the year , when dolphin also run heavy . Tuna , king and Spanish mackerel and other favored species abound throughout May . During the summer months , the ocean is as calm as a farm pond . Still , there are a number of species  --  including sailfish , dolphin , bonita , cobia , amberjack , bar jack  --  to be taken from the purple-colored water of the Gulf Stream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October . It gets windy later on in the winter , and winds can make offshore fishing rough while muddying up the flats and reducing visibility inshore . In summer , the Gulf Stream , which keeps the Keys warm in winter , is a cooling influence . Western Montana A final recommendation : One area that every trout fisherman should visit at least once in his lifetime is western Montana , especially around Yellowstone National Park . So many fine trout streams run here that you could n't fish all of them in several seasons . Many of these legendary streams are within a two-hour drive of West Yellowstone , Montana ( which can serve as your base ) . The Teton , Henry 's Fork , Fall and Snake Rivers all lie close to the south , while to the north are the Yellowstone , Gallatin , Madison and many others . And should you tire of all this outstanding fishing , the spectacular sites of Yellowstone Park are located just a few hundred yards from town . ' A          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
