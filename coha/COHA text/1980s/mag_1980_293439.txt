FALLING IN PLACE by Ann Beattie ; Random House ; 342 pages ; $10.95 <P> Skylab is falling ; Blondie 's throbbing Heart of Glass dissipates in the air waves ; the gas pumps are sucking dry . It is the summer of 1979 , the twilight of an entropic decade and the desultory time frame of Ann Beattie 's second novel . Her first , Chilly Scenes of Winter , was filmed last year as Head over Heels , and her short stories have been collected in two books , Distortions ( 1976 ) and Secrets and Surprises ( 1979 ) . Beattie , 32 , writes with quiet wit and subdued sympathy about the states of mind that have become the clichs of middle-class malaise . One need not elaborate , except to say that after 30 years of postwar fiction , American writers appear to have reversed Tolstoy 's happy-family dictum . It now appears that all unhappy families are alike . <P> The Knapps of Falling in Place are typical . Marriage for Louise and John survives by inertia . A divorce requires action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or incapable of taking . Instead they have a vague arrangement : John comes home to Connecticut on weekends for picnics and such with Louise and their children , Mary , 15 , and John Joel , 10 . During the week Knapp commutes from his Manhattan office to his mother 's house in suburban Westchester County . He usually arrives late because he spends the evenings with his mistress Nina in the city . At home , his children grow aimless and petulant . Visions of Peter Frampton fill Mary 's head and threaten her chances of passing a summer-school English course . Obese John Joel 's idea of a perfect day is : " Have Mary out of the house . Have the air conditioner on and read comics . No big deal . " <P> In fact , neither the Knapps nor the other characters who mill through the pages of the novel have an idea of what a big deal is . <P> What affects them is not the summer heat , but the cultural humidity , which Ann Beattie maintains just this side of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere occurs when John Joel plinks his sister in the side with a gun he did not know was loaded . It is the sort of casual , thoughtless act usually associated with children . But then most of Beattie 's grownups , particularly her men , behave in childish ways . <P> Knapp , for example , tries to penetrate his wife 's loneliness with an insensitive sexual prank that involves a duck 's foot taken from a Chinese restaurant . Louise does n't see the humor : " Is this what you and the New York girls are into ? " Hardly , as Nina can verify . She suggests that Knapp uses her apartment as a refuge , and he comes to see her point : " She was right that he hid in her apartment . He was hiding from himself , or at best playing peekaboo , pretending it was a safe game and that there were only little surprises : the infant seeing that it 's still a friend behind the fingers . " <P> Between the Knapps and their children is a middle generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the unenviable task of getting Mary and other Peter Frampton fans to pay a little attention to Jane Austen . Cynthia 's boyfriend , Peter Spangle , is in Spain dribbling away the last of a small inheritance . He left before reversing the fan in the kitchen window ; the hot air blows in.
