The temperature reached a stifling 108 degrees in parts of Los Angeles last week , but there was still a noticeable chill in the area . All along the California coast , doors and windows were bolted shut . Hardware stores experienced a run on security items , and weapons dealers reported a booming business . The pervasive fear had been aroused by the latest foray of the so-called Night Stalker , the serial killer who entered houses stealthily and seemingly at random , attacking and sometimes killing the occupants . Anxiety subsided Saturday when police at last arrested a suspect . <P> Most of the 16 murders and eight attacks that have been linked to the killer since February occurred in the San Gabriel and San Fernando valleys of Los Angeles , but in mid-August the Night Stalker moved north to San Francisco , entering a house in the Lakeside district and killing a 66-year-old accountant . Last week he struck in Mission Viejo , an Orange County community 50 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles . " My wife said maybe we should n't leave all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " recalled Charles Prather of Chrisanta Drive . " I said , ' How many houses are there between here and San Francisco ? ' " Early the following morning , the Night Stalker slipped into a ranch-style house just down the street from the Prathers ' . Apparently entering through a backyard window , he shot Computer Engineer Bill Carns in the head , raped his girlfriend and ransacked the house . Carns , 29 , was in critical condition at week 's end . <P> In the aftermath , police discovered an orange Toyota station wagon , stolen earlier , that they believe was used by the killer on the night of the attack . By tracing a fingerprint found in the car , authorities announced a " positive identification " of the suspected killer : Richard Ramirez , a native of El Paso , Texas , who has been drifting around Los Angeles and San Francisco for several years . The following day , Ramirez was seized in East Los Angeles . Police said he was chased and beaten by a crowd , apparently after trying to steal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , resembles victims ' descriptions of the Night Stalker . Like the attacker , he is tall and thin , with black hair and bulging eyes . Most significant , he has badly decayed teeth . Victims had said the serial killer 's teeth are markedly yellowed and gapped ; police identification artists had even composed a separate sketch of his mouth . <P> Before finding Ramirez 's fingerprint , investigators had been baffled by the lack of a discernible pattern in the attacks . Serial murderers usually seek out a particular kind of victim , but the Night Stalker assaulted people ranging in age from 16 to 84 . He had killed men and women , Asians as well as whites . In two cases he reportedly left behind written messages . Police confirmed that the killer had a distinctive trademark , but to avoid copycat assaults , they were tight-lipped about what it was . <P> Authorities said that Ramirez has a criminal record for auto theft , drugs and other , " relatively minor , " charges , but that none of his past offenses resembled the violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serial killings suspect that the Night Stalker shared at least one trait common to mass murderers . " Once they start to murder , the act becomes habitual , " says J. Reid Meloy , a San Diego forensic psychologist . " As it becomes habitual , it becomes easier . "
