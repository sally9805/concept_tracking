To the Editors : <P> I thank whatever gods there be that my family and I are an integral part of the throng of Americans pictured on your cover honoring the Constitution 's Bicentennial ( ( SPECIAL ISSUE , July 6 ) ) . <P> Karleen Home Rosaaen <P> Tucson <P> We the People should never forget to give thanks to our farsighted Founding Fathers . The document they hammered out that hot summer 200 years ago has stood firm and has had a long-lasting effect on the world . It has enabled our nation to be flexible in the wake of change while upholding the rights of each citizen . <P> Doug Wittmer <P> Topeka <P> Let us not toy with our Constitution . A modern-day convention would only create chaos and destroy the subtleties , language and spirit of the 1787 document . If our elected representatives can not resolve through legislative action issues now facing us such as the deficit , a balanced budget and government waste , then how could they possibly make a success of a constitutional convention ? <P> Angel O. Gomez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Union 's constitution states that the document grants every citizen the right to a job . Such a basic right is not to be found in ours . Chalk one up for the Soviets . <P> James Gardner Erickson <P> Minneapolis <P> The British do not have to worry about their lack of a written constitution . They have in Parliament what is known as a question hour , which acts as a check on executive power . Our history with Watergate and the Iran-contra affair makes me think it might be a good idea for our President to appear monthly before a congressional committee to report what he knows about this or is doing about that . We separate our governmental branches a little too much . <P> Alan O. Martlew <P> Camp Hill , Pa . <P> The Constitution 's great merit lies in its timeliness , its depth and its durability . People like Ralph Nader , the consumer advocate , and Bernie Sanders , the socialist mayor of Burlington , Vt. , would sacrifice the individual rights guaranteed by the Constitution for specific economic amendments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleeting in nature . Legislative avenues are available for the introduction of new notions . <P> Hugh Pearce <P> Wilmington , Del . <P> As an Indian who is touring the States , I welcomed your reference to the ideals that India 's constitution borrowed from the U.S. 's , particularly the fundamental rights of a citizen . Many Indians as well as Americans cherish the slogan " Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty . " <P> Eramangal A. Sivaraman <P> Bartlesville , Okla . <P> Even though I am a Canadian , I thoroughly admire the U.S. Constitution . No other country celebrates itself quite the way America does . <P> Jason Beck <P> Toronto
