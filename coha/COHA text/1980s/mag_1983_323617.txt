Wanted for murder , a militant tax evader is slain in Arkansas <P> Mayor Billy Davis of Smithville , Ark. ( pop . 113 ) , expected the worst when half a dozen police cars converged on his mountain hamlet 125 miles northeast of Little Rock late last Friday afternoon . " They were n't talking , " said Davis , " so I knew something was about to happen . " The officials , including four state troopers , a dozen federal marshals and FBI agents , the sheriff and three deputies , headed four miles north of town and set up roadblocks . Then they drove a mile down a dirt road to an isolated house that resembled a bunker . There , the nationwide search for Gordon W. Kahl , 63 , a retired farmer and militant tax protester , came to a fiery and bloody end . <P> Kahl had been wanted on murder charges since a shootout last February at Medina , N. Dak. , in which two federal marshals were killed . The marshals had been trying to serve a warrant on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure to file federal income tax returns . On May 28 , Kahl 's son Yorivon , 23 , and Scott Paul , 29 , were convicted of two counts of second-degree murder and six counts of assault in the episode . But the elder Kahl , a member of the ultraright-wing Posse Comitatus , a paramilitary organization that opposes income taxes and other forms of governmental authority , had managed to elude capture . <P> From the start , officials had kept a lookout on Arkansas ; they knew that Kahl had spent much of last year living in the state under an assumed name . About a week ago , a man who looked like Kahl was spotted near Smithville riding in a car that belonged to the son of Leonard and Norma Ginter , who occupied the bunker-like house and were said to be sympathizers of the tax-protest movement . When Arkansas officials gathered enough evidence to obtain a search warrant , the raid was organized . As the heavily armed police officers positioned themelves around the house , Sheriff Gene Matthews and three other men went up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custody . Then the sheriff stepped inside the house . He was immediately cut down by a bullet from Kahl 's high-powered rifle . <P> The other officers managed to drag the gravely wounded Matthews out , then opened fire on the house . The house went up in flames after a smoke bomb was thrown down an air vent . Thousands of rounds of ammunition , apparently stored inside , exploded . Said State Trooper Charles Harper : " We just pulled back and waited three and a half hours until it cooled down . It was raining hard , and lightning was striking all around . We did n't know which would get us first , the lightning or the bullets . " <P> Finally , a fire truck was brought in to hose down the smoldering building , and the officers removed a body found slumped over a rifle on the living-room floor . Although the Ginters had assured the police that Kahl was the only other person in the house , officials planned to examine the fugitive 's dental records before ruling that it was Kahl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " presumptive identification " based on the fact that the body bore evidence of shrapnel wounds , which Kahl had suffered in World War II .
