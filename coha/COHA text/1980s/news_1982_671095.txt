The event was unusual because no similar collection of Cheval Blanc is believed to exist anywhere else - not even at the chateau , a white stucco mansion that stands amid the vines of St.-Emilion , an important district in the Bordeaux region of France . The tasting was believed to be the first at which so many vintages of Cheval Blanc were sampled at once. // The 1947 and the 1929 , said by some connoisseurs to be two of the finest red wines made in this century , were exquisite , fully justifying their reputations . The ' 21 showed traces of its former style and the ' 49 , ' 53 and ' 59 were clearly on a par with the best Bordeaux in those vintages , in the opinion of this participant . The general level of quality of virtually all the 36 vintages was extremely high , moreover. // That Chateau Cheval Blanc should merit such accolades will come as no surprise to modern-day connoisseurs of the best red wines of Bordeaux , for they have always ranked Cheval Blanc among the foremost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognition as other Bordeaux estates with reputations that extend beyond the world of the connoisseur into that of the knowledgeable consumer. // The reasons have to do with geography , tradition and the structure of Bordeaux society . The 86-acre vineyard of Cheval Blanc is 20 miles inland from the east bank of the Gironde Estuary , where the city of Bordeaux lies , and the so-called east bank wines have never had quite the same cachet as those from the more western districts , Medoc , Graves and Sauternes , which are more accessible to the city. // The wines of St.-Emilion and the neighboring inland district of Pomerol could not be as readily marketed as those from the Bordeaux districts closer to the seaport , so they did not develop followings abroad until long after the others . Their situation also meant that their producers were not as readily accepted in the upper levels of Bordeaux society , and this too hampered their wines abroad. // In 1855 , when the wines of the Gironde were classified on the basis of quality at an exposition in Paris , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pomerol were excluded . Not until this century did they begin to win recognition among connoisseurs . The four chateaus designated premier grand cru , or first great growth , in 1855 were Lafite , Margaux , Latour and Haut-Brion ; Chateau Mouton Rothschild got the same ranking in 1973. // The vineyards of St.-Emilion did not receive their own official classification until 1955 , when Cheval Blanc and Chateau Ausone were designated as the two leading producers of the district. // Cheval Blanc was the last of the top-rated red-wine vineyards of Bordeaux to be established . In 1832 a parcel of 37 acres was split off from the neighboring Chateau Figeac , and 37 more acres from Figeac were added in 1837 . The assemblage was completed in 1854 with 12 acres more. // It has always been owned by the Fourcaud-Laussac family , and a descendant , Jacques Hebrard , is the current proprietor . No other major Bordeaux estate has been under continuous ownership for so long. // It was the Cheval Blanc 1921 , according to most accounts , that placed the estate firmly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality . The ' 47 , considered by many connoisseurs to be the best Bordeaux of that vintage , is ranked with the Chateau Margaux 1900 and a handful of others among the best reds of the century. // Lloyd C. Flatt , an aerospace consultant based in New Orleans , and Dr. Marvin C. Overton 3d , a neurosurgeon from Fort Worth , Tex. , were the prime movers behind the Cheval Blanc tasting . Both are avid collectors , with personal cellars in the 20 , 000-to-30 , 000-bottle range . They and nine other highly experienced tasters gathered in the Marie Antoinette Hotel on Sunday at 11 A.M. , the time of day considered ideal for tasting wine because the palate and the mind are fresh. // Mr. Flatt decided to abandon the normal procedure of tasting the youngest vintages first . " We ' re going to do this in a rather unorthodox way , " he said . " We ' re going to drink what I consider the good wines first and drink the young wines after lunch . " There was no dissent. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the 10 dozen Tiffany glasses purchased by Mr. Flatt for the occasion , and proceeded through the 1945 , ' 47 , ' 48 , ' 49 , ' 50 , ' 52 and ' 53 . Ranging from 29 to 39 years of age , these were expected to be at the optimum maturity for drinking , and that is the way they turned out. // During lunch , a show of hands was taken , and the ' 47 received more first-place votes than any other wine . Because of more numerous second- and third-place votes , the ' 49 was judged the group ' s favorite , although this method of scoring aroused controversy . The ' 47 was clearly the most unusual wine of this grouping , displaying great generosity of fruit. // Later came the 1933 , ' 34 and ' 37 , followed by the 1911 , ' 19 , ' 21 , ' 23 , ' 24 , ' 26 , ' 28 and ' 29 , and then the 1955 , ' 57 , ' 58 , ' 59 , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ' 66 . The final flight consisted of the 1967 , ' 68 , ' 69 , ' 70 , ' 71 , ' 76 , ' 78 and ' 79 . The 1975 , considered excellent , was omitted by oversight. // Showing especially well besides the wines in the first flight were the 1911 , ' 21 , ' 26 , ' 28 , ' 29 , ' 34 , ' 59 , ' 61 , ' 64 and ' 66 . Starting with 1970 , the wines were generally too young and astringent to assess accurately after nearly seven hours of tasting . Palate fatigue had set in. //
