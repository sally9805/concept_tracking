THE AENEID Translated by Robert Fitzgerald ; Random House ; 416 pages ; $20 <P> Those who translate words from one language into another always find that truth and beauty can not both be served . Something has to go . Voltaire 's parting shot when he left Holland ( " Adieu , canaux , canards , canaille ! " ) may be accurately rendered in English as " Farewell , canals , ducks , rabble ! " The only thing missing is everything that made Voltaire 's remark so witty and memorably alliterative in French . If a four-word mot successfully thwarts attempts to export it , the problems posed by an epic poem more than 10,000 lines long , written two millenniums ago in a language now deceased , are likely to be proportionately more impossible . <P> In taking on such a work , Poet and Translator Robert Fitzgerald inherited these general difficulties and a few specific ones as well . Virgil 's Aeneid is one of the two or three most influential texts in Western literature , yet it achieved such eminence in part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and survived the Dark Ages in manuscript , while Greek was largely forgotten . <P> When the Renaissance rediscovered the originals of the Homeric epics , Virgil 's reputation started to tarnish . The Greeks had clearly borne great gifts to the Roman poet . The Aeneid now looked suspiciously like a pastiche . Its first half , recounting the wandering of Aeneas and his vanquished colleagues after the fall of Troy , owed more than a little to The Odyssey . Its last six books , in which the hero wages war on Italian tribes and fulfills his divine destiny to found the Roman Empire , showed the bloody imprint of The Iliad . Furthermore , Aeneas himself , compared with the Homeric heroes Odysseus and Achilles , began to strike many readers as a stick-in-the-mud : pius ( Virgil 's repeated adjective ) , the kind of sobersides who would abandon the woman who loves him to her funeral pyre rather than miss out on his mission . <P> " I sing of warfare and a man at war . " Fitzgerald 's version of The Aeneid 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the traditional reading in English , enshrined in the title of George Bernard Shaw 's Arms and the Man . Yet singing of arms and the man was not all that Virgil 's fellow Romans in the 1st century B.C. would have understood him to mean . They had already been thoroughly schooled on who Aeneas was and what he had , in legend , accomplished ; neither his identity nor his military prowess could have been in doubt . Fitzgerald 's rendition of Virgil 's famous introduction may offend purists . It is not , strictly speaking , literal , but something more than that : a recapturing of implicit meanings in explicit terms . <P> This explanatory impulse pervades Fitzgerald 's Aeneid and brings both the story and its main character back to life . <P> The translator does not attempt to reproduce Virgil 's rolling hexameters , so sonorous in Latin and soporific in English . He chooses instead a blank verse Umber enough to accommodate both dignity and verve . Through this medium , Aeneas can be seen again as he must have first appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and live in the latter part of the 20th century .
