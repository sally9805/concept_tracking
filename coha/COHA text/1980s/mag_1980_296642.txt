The President emerges-cautiously-from his Rose Garden <P> " I 'm free ! I 'm free ! " exulted President Carter as he ran around the South Lawn of the White House in his T shirt . Or so said one top presidential aide , joking about the fact that his boss abandoned the White House Rose Garden last week and started campaigning again after 186 days of self-imposed isolation . Still Carter was only half free as he made his first political foray since the capture of the Tehran hostages . Though he had just swept to solid victories over Senator Edward M. Kennedy in the primary elections in Indiana , North Carolina and Tennessee ( losing only in the District of Columbia ) , Carter was not sure how he would be received by a public fed up with inflation , the lingering captivity of the hostages and the rescue mission that so ignominiously collapsed . But if there were not many huzzahs for the President , there were not many catcalls either . In the rigorously scheduled day , Carter was not permitted to stumble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where an hour-long memorial service was held for the eight servicemen* who died in the aborted raid in Iran . After meeting beforehand with the families of the dead men , Carter delivered a nine-minute eulogy . " It is not the length of life , " he said , " that determines its impact or its quality , but the depth of its commitment and the height of its purpose . " While Carter spoke , his voice was firm . But later , when a lone bugler played taps , when six Thunderbird jets swooped across the sky in the " missing-man formation , " when the hymn God of Our Fathers swelled up from the audience , the President wiped away tears with a handkerchief . <P> Flying to Philadelphia aboard helicopter Marine One , Carter was greeted with a rousing rendition of Hail to the Chief , the tune he had not allowed to be played in his presence for two years because of the pomp it brought to the presidency . But there was no further hailing the chief on this occasion . In an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar halting style , Carter had little new or forceful to say . Still citing SALT II as a major accomplishment , he pledged to seek ratification " at the earliest opportune time . " He warned that foreign policy is " not a matter of instant successes ... We must expect prolonged management of seemingly intractable situations and often contradictory realities . " <P> The President 's spirits seemed to lift a little when he attended the last event of the day , a " town meeting " of the type he greatly enjoys . For 68 minutes , he bantered easily with some 1,700 people gathered in McGonigle Hall at Temple University . When somebody complimented him for doing a " marvelous job , " he quipped that this was his favorite question so far . The audience applauded . <P> <P> The questions were far from zingers.
