" Pyramid " consists of five triangular sections , each different in shape , each with its weight shifted in a different direction . The image also shifts , depending on our point of view . From the far left , but only from the far left , do some of the triangles project sculpturally into space in a way that suggests an actual pyramid . From other points of view , the work contradicts the weight and bulk of a pyramid . The triangles float and remain paper thin , like a fan , or like certain creatures of the sea. // As usual with a LeWitt wall drawing , " Pyramid " was executed by others ; as usual , when its time is up , on Sept. 2 , the wall drawing will be painted over and disappear . Following the artist ' s diagram , David Higginbotham , Anthony Sansotta and Jo Watanabe produced the work by drawing its outlines on the wall and then coloring them in with India ink . The ground of the entire wall is yellow ; each section consists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Although the geometry and earth colors have the immemorial feel of a 14th-century Italian fresco , the uniform ground and the liquid thinness of the ink make the work seem translucent and transient . In addition , there is no consistent illusionism . Since the colors are not absorbed by the yellow ground but sit on top of it , the image remains more or less flat. // What is LeWitt after ? For one thing , although " Pyramid " refers to painting , sculpture , drawing and architecture , it can not be categorized as any of them . Its distinct identity draws our attention away from the Egyptian pyramids , with their loaded associations , toward issues of perception and vision . The great strength of the work is the way we are led to look hard at every line , shape and movement . It is almost exhilarating to inch our way along the edges of the triangle at the far right and see it shoot back in one direction and then almost explode to the right - like a wall in steep perspective or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take familiar shapes and make us see them brand new. // But the success of this approach is inseparable from its weaknesses - particularly when the forms are not modular . To sustain the work as an object of intellectual reflection , it must remain visually unfinished . While each section is coherent in itself , " Pyramid " is not coherent as a whole . If it were , it would be a painting. // From one triangle to the next , the shapes bob and weave like a drunken sailor . While the far right point anchors the work on one side , the left side seems loose and the bottom line looks like it could be unmoored by the wind . The wall drawing suggests tension and scale , but allows neither . This particular balancing act between conventional and alternative art , between completeness and incompleteness , makes this observer long for the kind of painting and sculpture that " Pyramid " asks us to analyze and reconsider .

He painted on it , applied strips of wood to the surface of paintings and used them to represent such antiwood elements as fire and water . He also assembled " pets " with it and used a chainsaw to awaken nude figures from the trunks of doomed trees. // The " pets " could be from the same family of birds as the San Diego chicken . They are tall , beaky creatures , assembled from thin chunks of wood that seem like crate scraps or kindling . The birds turn one room into their own cage , pecking , squawking , cooing and striding in a array of gestures that also grow out of the history of modern sculpture , from Brancusi to Giacometti . No less modernist is the assemblage technique and the strange combination of exuberance and fragility that makes these beasts so engaging. // Equally rooted in the history of sculpture are the chainsaw people Sharon salvaged from trees afflicted with Dutch elm disease on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around in positions that suggest sculptures from Michelangelo to Rodin , but they are also about to do cartwheels or stand on their heads . Each figure and its base is one piece , cut out of one tree , so that the acrobatic gestures can make these sculptures , too , seem both spontaneous and precarious - as if any pressure against them would lead to a fall . ( Through Wednesday . ) " Innovative Still Life " ( Holly Solomon Gallery , 724 Fifth Avenue ) : At a time when there have been a number of museum still-life exhibitions , this show of still lifes and still-life-related objects by more than 60 artists is well timed . The works are by artists ranging from Milton Avery , Alice Neel and Ellsworth Kelly , through Pop artists like Andy Warhol , Claes Oldenberg and Roy Lichtenstein to graffiti artists and artists identified with the East Village . Although the show serves the gallery ' s purposes by suggesting that pattern painting , with which the gallery is still identified , is essential to the current profusion of still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important still life has become in contemporary art . And it leads us to consider what it means. // Contemporary still lifes seem to evolve from Pop Art . In the work of artists like Lichtenstein , Oldenburg and Warhol , still-life objects like books , flowers and fruit generally ceased to become sources of investigation , wonder and discipline . They became instead tools with which artists could hammer and chuckle away at art and middle-class life. // The show suggests what was gained and what was lost in the shift . There are clever and biting works by Rodney Alan Greenblat , Eric Fischl and others that would not have been possible if still-life objects were still weighed down by tradition . But , with the exception of artists like Nancy Graves and Robert Kushner , many of the more recent uses of still life also seem uprooted . They are independent not only of the restrictions that had been set by those objects , but also from what those restrictions made possible . The works , however clever , seem slight . In short , this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole . ( Through Wednesday . ) Norman Tuck ( Exit Art Gallery , 578 Broadway ) : Norman Tuck is a gifted artist who makes large kinetic sculptures , some of them elegant and funny , that wait for us to set them in motion . Each object , in materials ranging from steel to wood , can be identified with a machine we know . When the sculptures move , however , they shift our perspective away from the routine order of machines in the direction of ritual and disorder , in the process suggesting the imaginative potential of objects about which we normally do not think. // The most complex work in this show , " Random Clockwork , " consists of bamboo poles organized into the frame of a tall , tepeelike construction . When a metal weight is attached to a string on one or the other side , the poles start banging away at each other . The sounds suggest the ticking of a crazy clock . The clacking wood makes us think of jousting , or of karate chops .

In her pastels , she approaches the past from a different perspective than Giorgio di Chirico and contemporary Italian mannerists , which her work suggests . Her pastels are crammed with antique heads , columns and urns , usually pushed against the front of a pictorial space that remains indefinite , placeless . The faces of the sculptures may be yellowed , which suggests spotlighting , but also disuse. // Indeed , while the objects are cut off from their original context , there is little sense of decay or nostalgia , and no sense that these objects are dead or useless . Rather , she seems to have stored them in her work , in all their potential , where they are waiting for someone to come along and use them in an appropriate way .
