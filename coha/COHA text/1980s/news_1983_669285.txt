They said ' t was a job which couldn ' t be doneAnd he who tried would rue it. // So he took on this job which ' ' couldn ' t be done ' ' - And couldn ' t do it ! // // and it most succinctly summarises my experience in the world of Do It Yourself . It has long been a cause of sorrow - and expense - that in our home and over the years I have tended to rationalise the fact that I seem to have five thumbs where carpentry is concerned , with airy claims that I am primarily a Planner , an Ideas Man , or even an Administrator . Anything that absolves me from actually Doing It Myself . Naturally and inevitably there exists on the fringe of my life a covey of people who not only Do It Themselves but who , worse still , are willing to explain in depth how easy it will be for me ' ' If You Will Only Concentrate . ' ' And this is only deflected with some difficulty . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat sinister offer to teach them judo ( ' ' It doesn ' t hurt much after the first few lessons . . . ' ' ) . It seems to dissipate the impression that they have found a captive audience for their unpleasant skill with hammer and nails. // Unfortunately , however , the worst recently befell me . My wife joined the DIY tribe as a sort of non-playing supporter and shortly after my last line of defence ( ' ' I ' ll get down to it one day when I have the time ' ' ) began to crumble ominously . It was all over my collection of books . I have been accustomed to piling them - neatly , I maintain - in the corner behind our broad Regency armchair where they are pretty well out of view to all except the nosiest of visitors . Unfortunately , these seem to have been on the increase , and such phrases from my wife as ' ' Mary ( or Jane or Elizabeth ) says that John ( or Philip or George ) ran up a bookshelf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the air waves . Then my wife played what she regards as her debating ace , i. e. she mutters about slaving over a hot stove , at which point I recognise the truth of the Duke of Wellington ' s dictum that ' ' the sign of a good general is to know when to reteat and dare to do it . ' ' I knew . I retreated and set out to find the necessary pieces of wood sufficient for one bookshelf. // Now there is a romantic impression abroad that England is a green and pleasant land filled with trees , e. g. ' ' the oak and the ash/and the bonny ivy tree/they flourish at home/in my own country . ' ' I wish to state that these days they do nothing of the sort . Wood is very difficult to come by just now and when you do , the price is outrageous . Incidentally , I know now why ships are built of steel and not wood . It ' s cheaper . However , a small yard near where we live produced some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really matter if one side of the finished article bears the faint stencilling ' ' . . . rom Chic : Mich . . . do not . . . ' ' and the other ' ' . . . M &; W 33 Hull . . . tare weight . . . ' ' for I feel that one day this will puzzle some antique dealers in this district. // I do not really wish to discuss ' in depth , ' ' as they say , the matter of my first effort . Suffice it to note that it tended to resemble the Leaning Tower of Pisa and squeaked when a trial volume was laid on it . However , since this was a collected volume of the Works of James Joyce , this may have only been a form of criticism . In military parlance , I drew off to regroup . During the ensuing pause , which lasted some weeks , I took various alternative steps . I even tried to bribe one of our DIY friends to ' ' run it up ' ' for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' that would take all the fun of it away . ' ' I then came across a booklet entitled ' ' Be Your Own Carpenter . ' ' It was indeed a mine of information . The trouble was that the mining tools were numerous and expensive . It listed twenty-seven instruments from saws , tenons and gauges to planes , vises and chisels without which ' ' no carpenter worthy of the name ' ' would be found . I concluded that I was unworthy and became very broody. // It was when I was beginning to feel inadequate that salvation came . It arrived in the form of the magic word ' ' functional . ' ' We had been watching one of those TV chat shows where an audience bullies an expert . In this case it was an architect who was being harassed over those monstrous box-like structures which have been springing up in London the last few years , and which no one except architects ( and possibly cost accountants ) seem to like . He was driven back to muttering that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' i. e. suitable for purpose with no frills , but doing the job of holding in the contents - in this case a few hundred office workers . Well now ! No frills . No clever stuff . That was what my bookshelf would be : functional ! Clutching the word in my bosom , I set to work. // I reverted to what could loosely be called first principles and , rejecting such reactionary concepts as rounded edges , carved sides and joints , I told myself that a bookshelf is a strip of wood ( or two or three ) supported by two vertical pieces secured to it by the most expeditious and easy form of link . Over two days I proceeded to put this view into effect , pausing like any honest British worker for tea breaks as needed . The wall did show a distressing tendency to crumble where I banged in the nails , but I ignored it and slowly there came into view the image of a bookshelf . The pride and sense of achievement I felt could only be compared to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round Jerusalem . Such things cast a light on the Old Testament , I believe ; for I do not now doubt that as the wall reached its final stages , Nehemiah must have become intolerably puffed up and a sore trial to all those around him . It was an interesting coincidence that his wall and my bookshelf took roughly about the same time to complete - ' ' fifty and two days . ' ' Well , I didn ' t have any staff working for me as he did. // Looked at from a corner of the room , my shelves look quite good . A teacher of woodwork came to dinner the other night and though he blinked a little , he made no comment . Social discipline is a wonderful thing . In my expansive moments I regard those shelves as a symbol of man ' s struggle against the remorseless forces of nature and of those creative powers which have raised him above the beasts of the field. // My wife says they will do until we can afford some ' ' real ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But will they be half as ' ' functional ' ' ? // //
