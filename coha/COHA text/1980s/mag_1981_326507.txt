When Abolhassan Banisadr arrived in Paris , he was immediately surrounded by admirers , just as he once paid court to Khomeini when Khomeini was in exile in Paris . Shortly after reaching the city , Banisadr was visited by TIME 's Paris bureau chief , Jordan Bonfante . His report : <P> A steady stream of worshipful Iranian supporters line up to receive instructions from Banisadr . At a dining-room table , a dozen young Iranian students work on mimeographed communiqus . Husky bodyguards carefully screen all visitors . The former President is seated on a couch before a big mahogany coffee table . Above his head hangs a campaign poster of himself . He now has neither the mustache nor the glasses that appear in the picture . Relaxed in shirtsleeves , his shoes off , he appears slightly pudgy and tired , but good-humored and confident . <P> Banisadr believes the chances for the success of his resistance movement are high because popular opposition to Khomeini 's regime is spreading fast . He is convinced that the people no longer honor Khomeini as their religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mobilize mass demonstrations before the French embassy in Tehran after his escape and managed to muster only 5,000 , a pittance compared with the hundreds of thousands who used to turn out . Even more encouraging , he feels , the intelligentsia are siding with the resistance and so are the armed forces . Those who ask why the armed forces do not take action against the regime are told that it is because they are still engaged in the war against Iraq . <P> Banisadr , in fact , has told his supporters that he is not in favor of a military coup d ' tat because he believes the populace must take the initiative in acting against the regime . He envisions a mounting wave of mass demonstrations like those that eventually toppled the Shah . <P> Since he arrived in Paris , Banisadr has insisted that he has no intention of renouncing his title and responsibilities as Iran 's President . He reminds supporters that he originally offered his resignation to Khomeini but that the Ayatullah refused to publish it and instead chose to outlaw him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims , he would have represented a dangerous rallying force against Khomeini . Rather than allow that , Khomeini tried to suppress him altogether . <P> Banisadr thinks that he was able to hide out successfully in Tehran for so long because of the basic disarray of the government , which prevented it from conducting systematic searches . On July 23 , Banisadr tells his supporters , there were 120 bombings in Tehran , and he asks , smiling , how anyone could have had time to hunt for him . <P> If he was fairly secure in hiding , and even able to organize active resistance on the spot , what compelled Banisadr to leave Iran ? There are several reasons .
