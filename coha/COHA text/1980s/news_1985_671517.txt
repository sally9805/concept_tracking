But when Federal specialists switched on their monitoring equipment this week , instead of finding significantly lower levels of the gas , radon , they recorded the highest concentration ever reported in this country. // " The systems they ' re installing aren ' t working , " Mrs. Jones said . " I ' m dealing with something that ' s invisible , it ' s silent and it ' s a killer . I don ' t understand it and I ' m terrified. " // Since last January , when dangerously high levels of radon were found in a house across the street from Mrs. Jones , a survey of 3 , 618 houses and other buildings in the area by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources has found 1 , 417 , about 40 percent , with unsafe levels of radon. // The findings have led state officials to believe that the problem may be worse than anticipated and has prompted the department to begin a survey of 30 , 000 more homes. #10 , 000 to 20 , 000 Deaths " People really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major carcinogen and it certainly leads the list of indoor pollutant problems in the nation , " said Dr. Naomi Harley , a research professor of environmental medicine at New York University ' s medical school who has studied radon and its health effects. // Exposure to high concentrations of radon has been shown in studies of uranium miners to cause lung cancer , and the Federal Environmental Protection Agency estimates it is responsible for 10 , 000 to 20 , 000 deaths each year . That makes it the second leading cause of death from lung cancer after cigarette smoking , according to the agency. // Residents of this largely rural area say the discovery of the gas , which is produced by the decay of vast uranium deposits beneath a geologic formation called the Reading Prong that extends from eastern Pennsylvania into New York , has reshaped their lives. // " Everything is different , " Mrs. Jones said as she sat in her kitchen , nervously smoking cigarettes , the day after the high readings were taken . " My kids used to come home and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . I ' m always wrapped up on the telephone now . You wonder how you ever got so involved in all this. " // The radon level at Mrs. Jones ' s house was 15. 668 " working levels , " a measurement of radioactive alpha particles . The E.P.A. says that any measurement above 0. 02 is unsafe . The agency said 15 working levels carries the same risk of lung cancer as smoking 150 packs of cigarettes a day . <> <> Some Advised to Leave // Many of those people whose houses have been termed unsafe live in developments built in the last 15 years on open meadows that were once covered with apple and peach orchards . Many residents , like Mrs. Jones , bought the land and then saved for two or three years before building . " You don ' t work 10 years for your house and just lose it , " Mrs. Jones said. // But several families whose homes had high radon levels were advised by the state environmental agency to evacuate . In Boyertown the Lincoln School was closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counties have also been closed after high levels of radon were found. // Some banks in the area now require radon tests before they approve mortgages , and homeowners who want to sell homes with high radon levels have had difficulty. // Already more than 15 , 000 residents have asked the state to test in their homes . The State Department of Environmental Resources , which set up an office in the back of a grocery store here , has been receiving calls from people anxious about radon as far away as California and Maine. // New York has announced that it will begin conducting a statewide radon survey in November , and the New Jersey Senate is considering a measure to provide $3. 2 million for evaluating the danger . <> <> Vents in 18 Homes // For many of the people here whose houses recorded high radon levels , last week ' s reading at Mrs. Jones ' s house has shown once again , they say , how little officials know about handling the problem. // The E.P.A. has installed ventilating systems in 18 homes that recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , D. Bruce Henschel , said the systems installed in two of these homes did not reduce the radon concentrations , but in the others they reduced them by 80 to 90 percent . The Jones house , however , was one of the 16 successful systems before the agency took new readings. // Radon gas oozes out of the ground and enters houses through leaks in concrete slab floors and cement-block basement walls . The E.P.A. ' s ventilating systems create a suction around a house ' s basement to collect radon and blow it away from the house . Several dozen homes now sport new white pipes poking out of basement windows - many installed by homeowners mimicking the E.P.A. - and small electric fans buzz continuously. // What happened at Mrs. Jones ' s house , E.P.A. officials said , was that by opening a bathroom window the other morning , she had turned her house into a giant vaccum . The open window created a draft that drew in air , and radon , through leaks in the house ' s slab foundation and basement walls . Officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoves , all equipment that draws air from inside the house and blows it outside , could have a similar effect . <> <> Uncertainty Is the Worst // It is that uncertainty of not knowing what effect , if any , such everyday activities will have that the homeowners seem to find most disconcerting. // " We ' re sitting here and we don ' t know whether to do the laundry or what windows to open , " said Kathleen Varady , who lives with her husband and four children near Mrs. Jones. // Other residents are especially worried by the approach of cold weather , when they would ordinarily close windows to keep heat in and start wood stoves or build fires in chimneys . All those activities , however , could create a draft that draws radon into a basement , state environmental officials have warned them. // " I felt more secure last winter keeping my windows cracked all the time , " said Mrs. Jones . " Then they put this system in , and everything went haywire. " // But the discovery of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect . Before last week , people she had known for years would accost Mrs. Jones in the Acme supermarket here and ask why she was making such a fuss over radon . Other homeowners who had complained of high levels in their homes said neighbors were angry with them. // " Boyertown is the old Pennsylvania Dutch people , " Mrs. Jones said . " They don ' t see it . They would just as soon ignore it . But this morning for the first time since January , the woman down the hill in back called to see if there was anything she could do.
