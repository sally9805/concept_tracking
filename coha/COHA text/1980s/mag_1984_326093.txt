How come you 're so upper class and we 're so lower class , and you 're our daughter ? " a Government economist named Jacob Perlman once asked his sassy child Judith . Not an easy question for the future Miss Manners to answer . Perhaps some kind of metamorphosis began back when Perlman worked for the United Nations and moved his family to the Philippines . Recalls Judith Martin : " My father sat us down , my brother and me , and said , ' Children , we have to tell you something . We have reached the crucial point when the servants outnumber us 2 to 1 . It takes a while to get used to this kind of life . It takes about two minutes . And it takes the rest of your life to get unused to it . ' " <P> While still a student at Wellesley , where she claimed to have majored in gracious living , Martin got her first job on the Washington Post . " It was an accident , " she says . " My parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought the Post would be a safe place to apply , thinking they would never hire me since I had no experience .

" <P> Robert Martin , 49 , an affable , Harvard-educated physician who does research in biochemical genetics at the National Institutes of Health , claims that his own manners have required no polishing during their 25-year marriage because he was " already perfect when we met , and so was she . " If anyone has the temerity to address him as Mr. Manners , says Dr. Martin , " I correct them immediately . I tell them it 's Lord Manners , not Mr. Manners . " ( The name Miss Manners derives from a figure in Victorian English folklore who was originally called Lady Manners . She was conjured up so that when children tried to gobble all the food on the table , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate " for Lady Manners . " )
