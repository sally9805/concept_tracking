 | Robert Longo is an unlikely model for the proverbial portrait of an artist as a young man . The 31-year-old artist already commands $40,000 for a single work ? and he will probably make at least $300,000 this year . Demand for his drawings , sculptures and giant wall constructions is so great that he often hires more than a half dozen assistants to ensure that his projects move along on schedule . Longo , who speeds around New York in a pricey new Saab , says he never expected this kind of career . " I figured I 'd have to teach to earn money , " he says . " I did n't think I 'd sell a lot of my art . " He certainly never imagined he 'd sell so much , so soon , for such extraordinary prices . The main reason is that he , like an aggressive group of other young artists ( among them , Julian Schnabel , David Salle and Keith Haring ) , is actively promoting the art he produces . " I 'm a good salesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people , " he boasts . " I convince them that I 'm going to be an artist forever and an important one . " This new flair for the big business of art seems to work : an unprecedented number of young artists who are still virtual newcomers to the scene are now drawing six-figure incomes . And superstars such as Schnabel and Salle are each pulling in yearly sales of more than $1 million . Their prosperity has helped to spark a new boom in New York 's art market . The last four auctions of contemporary art at both Sotheby Parke Bernet and Christie 's , which included works by these young artists , raked in an impressive $24 million . Gallery sales in New York this year for all types of fine art are expected to soar well over $1 billion . ( Half of the proceeds from gallery sales go to the dealers . ) And the new breed of artist has developed a fine eye for the bottom line . " I feel strongly about rec- ognizing that this is a business we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Janelle Reiring , cofounder of the Metro Pictures gallery in New York 's Soho art district . " Artists want galleries that are more progressive ? that will promote their careers . " Many artists now work closely with their dealers in determining how many shows to mount each year , where to advertise , how much to spend on parties and other promotions and , most important , the price of their art . Longo , for example , decided he wanted to retain a special copyright on all of the drawings that he sells . This enables him to borrow the work back from the owner , as he did recently , for a museum showing of his art . He has also changed the kind of art he makes . Longo made the switch primarily as a way to explore other creative avenues , but he also recognizes it as a smart business move . Instead of the life-size drawings of people frozen in motion that first made him popular , Longo now creates huge art works that mix sculpture , painting and other mediums . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tired-out product like Atari , " he says with a laugh . Chalk Drawings : In contrast , a few artists are making the most out of their original style while it 's still hot . Keith Haring first got his start making cartoonlike chalk drawings in New York 's subways . His now famous images of flying television sets and dogs sporting alligator heads ? which derive from the designs of the Aztec Indians ? have been transferred to large sheets of vinyl and fiber glass that sell for as much as $20,000 each . In order to attract a broader , if less affluent , market as well , Haring plans to emblazon the same striking figures on sheets , clothing and watches ? all of which he 'll sell in his own store . To teach artists basic business skills , several of the country 's art schools have begun offering business courses . At the Art Institute of Chicago , students are now taught elementary 1 bookkeeping , the ins and outs of contracts , ways to promote their work , how g the business side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to such nontraditional buyers as architects or other professionals for use in their offices . @# ? Gallery owners are also changing their style . A sharp eye for good art is n't enough anymore ; many gallery owners realize they must master marketing , promotion , pricing and other hard-core business practices . Public-relations consultants , investment advisers , legal and tax experts and other business consultants are now commonplace in the art industry . In fact , some young artists now complain that the talk in art circles no longer centers on critical topics about the craft itself , but on career structuring and market positioning . No one was quicker to embrace these corporate techniques in the early ' 80s than Soho gallery owner Mary Boone . Following the advice of Charles Saatchi ( director of London-based Saatchi &; Saatchi , the world 's seventh largest ad agency ) and veteran art dealer Leo Castelli , Boone used an aggressive brand of marketing , publicity and salesmanship to establish herself ? and neoexpressionist artist Julian Schnabel ( both barely past 30 at the time ) ? as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Creating Demand : Boone relied on a classic corporate strategy . Like any business selling something new , she used advertising and publicity to attract attention to Schnabel 's arresting but relatively unknown pictures . She mounted shows at which most paintings were sold before the opening and were then exhibited to the public with the name of the purchaser proudly posted alongside . She spread the word about the scarcity of Schnabel 's art in People , Life , Esquire and other popular magazines . As demand for Schnabel 's paintings grew , she raised the prices far faster than the traditional 10 to 15 percent yearly increments that had always been the rule for even such established artists as Jasper Johns and Frank Stella . Schnabel 's paintings , which sold for $3,000 in 1977 when he was still with Boone 's gallery , now fetch more than $60,000 at the swanky Pace Gallery . Many other gallery owners are now investing heavily to promote new artists ? a bold switch from the past practice of concentrating on artists who were already well established .

He is equally generous when it comes to mounting their frequent shows : the cost of photographers , catalogs , promotional dinners for collectors and critics and a splashy opening night can run as high as $50,000 per exhibition . These investments have paid off : for the first time , Shafrazi and other gallery owners have long lists of buyers waiting for their young artists ' work . Not surprisingly , there are those in the art community who worry that business instincts will stifle artistic growth . " Thinking of art as a product does n't work , because in order to be successful you have to meet the needs of your market by doing what sells , " warns Marcia Tucker , founder of the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York . " Successful artists often ca n't afford to experiment . " Jedd Garet knows how confining success can be .

" I have to make a conscious effort to fight typecasting and hope that they will want the next thing . " And they probably will ? as long as it is marketed right . @#
