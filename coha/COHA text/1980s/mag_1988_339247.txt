TV 's newest evening newscast contains no crime footage , no clips of Bush and Dukakis trading jabs on the campaign trail , no fluffy features on roller- skating or baseball-card collectors . A typical show last week opened instead with a nearly 6-min. report on the upcoming election in Chile .

" <P> For viewers of World Monitor , a nightly program of international news produced by the Christian Science Monitor , time does seem to be standing still .

Company executives deny this . " The paper is the fundamental building block on which the other elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concedes that among the staff " there is concern about these things being a great deal on our plate at the moment .
