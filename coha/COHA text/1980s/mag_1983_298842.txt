Prosecutors say telephone oil-lease pitchmen swindled 66,000 <P> The earnest voice on the telephone described the offer as a sure thing . By sending $8,784 to the U.S. Oil and Gas Corp . in Coral Gables , Fla. , the customer would be guaranteed-in writing-to win a lease worth $25,000 for the oil and gas rights on a parcel of U.S. Government land . Between September 1982 and June 1983 , some 66,000 people drew down savings and took out loans to send the company money . <P> According to the U.S. Attorney 's office in Miami , the customers were caught in an elaborate telephone trap designed to lure the greedy and the gullible . Of the 66,000 , only 60 people got leases , making the " sure thing " a one-in-a-thousand shot . John Aboudara , a San Francisco engineer , and his wife Susan were victims . Says Susan : " We have two young kids , and that money could have been spent much better than giving it to someone we did n't know . It hurts to be dumb . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oil and Gas , including Gurdon Wolfson , the company 's owner and president , and Larry Waxman , its executive director , for fraud and conspiracy . All pleaded not guilty ; if convicted , they face possible fines of $10,000 and three years in prison . In addition , Federal District Judge William Hoeveler , acting on a civil suit filed by the Federal Trade Commission , last week issued an injunction to prevent U.S. Oil and Gas from continuing its fraudulent sales . He froze the company 's assets and in effect put it out of business . Said the judge : " The profit to the company was enormous , and the chance for reward to customers was almost nonexistent . " <P> Testimony by former employees of U.S. Oil and Gas provided a fascinating , behind-the-scenes glimpse of what law enforcement officials call a " boiler room " operation . Such telephone-sales scams are springing up in South Florida faster than authorities can shut them down . Testified James Bennett , a U.S. Oil and Gas salesman who quit because his conscience bothered him : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . And if their mother was already sold , they 'd go out and buy another mother and sell her at a profit . " <P> The scheme revolved around the lotteries that the U.S. Bureau of Land Management holds every two months for oil and gas leases on about 1,200 tracts of Western land . This terrain is not the Government 's most valuable property . Says Kathy Cooney , a Bureau of Land Management official in Wyoming , where most of the federal land is located : " About 98% of this land has been leased before , and no oil or gas was found . " <P> U.S. Oil and Gas told customers that for $8,784 they could buy chances to get leases on 48 different parcels of land , competing against only six to eight people per tract . None of those other six or eight , the telephone salesmen promised , would be clients of U.S. Oil and Gas . In reality , 1,000 people or more were pitted against one another in the lotteries for most tracts , and in at least one case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Gas . Of each $8,784 investment that the company took in , $3,600 was used for Government filing fees , $1,600 was the salesman 's commission , and the remaining $3,584 went to U.S. Oil and Gas .
