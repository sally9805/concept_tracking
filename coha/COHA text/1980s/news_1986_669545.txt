Sitting around a large table , they will spend the next two hours considering one of the most profound decisions of their lives - what one participant calls ' ' The Great Baby Debate. ' ' // To have or not to have a family . That is the persistent question bringing these 14 people to this community clinic for a five-week course called ' ' Baby Maybe . ' ' Through films , discussions , and readings , they will examine the ' ' pro- and anti-natalist ' ' influences around them . In the process , they hope to come to terms with their own ambivalence about parenthood. // // ' ' People who take this course tend to be very deliberate and conscious about everything they do in their lives , ' ' says Norma Denbrook , who conducts the class . ' ' By habit or by nature , they think through very carefully and very logically all the options and all the consequences . When you ' re making a pro and con list on an emotionally charged issue like this , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a lot of confusion as a result. ' ' // These couples are not alone in their confusion . In a nation that reveres youth but is often uncomfortable in the presence of the young , mixed signals abound . In 1970 , 53 percent of women surveyed in a national poll cited motherhood as one of the best parts of being a woman . By 1983 , that figure had dropped to 26 percent . The proliferation of adults-only apartments , and books with titles like ' ' Childless by Choice , ' ' hint at negative attitudes . Essays and talk shows of the ' 80s have even asked : ' ' Do we hate children ? ' ' // At the same time , a flood of books on child-rearing ( more than 300 , by one count ) , a booming toy industry , and public outrage over missing children and child abuse suggest a continuing commitment to children , sometimes bordering on veneration. // Until the last decade the intellectualized ' ' Baby Maybe ' ' form of decisionmaking was largely unknown in America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , either by accident or design , most couples became parents. // Then the accepted value of the family rather suddenly changed . Instead of seeing children as extra hands - a resource - parents saw them as extra mouths - a liability . Calculators began clicking as couples added up the staggering cost of child-rearing - perhaps as high as $150 , 000 from birth to age 18. // Even so , cost is not the prime factor for many vacillating couples. // Allan C. Carlson , president of the Rockford Institute in Rockford , Ill. , traces much of the ambivalence to the cultural revolution that has occurred in the United States in the last 30 years . First came a surge of feminism and its radicalization in the late ' 60s . Around the same time , he says , there was ' ' a revival of Malthusian concern about overpopulation , which translated into a campaign heavily directed against anyone who dared have more than two children . The message was : ' You ' re a better person if you don ' t have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' // He also cites ' ' the triumph of what ' s loosely called the sexual revolution - the almost total disappearance of social mores that confined sexuality within the marital bond , and the loss of a normative , shared sense of what a family is. // ' ' When you add all that together , ' ' Dr. Carlson continues , ' ' the surprise is not that people don ' t have children or don ' t like them . The surprise is that many people still do have children despite all of the cultural , economic , and governmental pressures that are imposed. ' ' // The pertinent facts are these : Childbearing has dropped to its lowest level in this decade . The fertility rate now stands at 65. 8 births per 1 , 000 women age 18 to 44 - down from 71. 1 per 1 , 000 in 1980 . To take the long view , in 1800 , women bore an average of seven children . Today , the average is two. // Harold Richman , director of the Chapin Hall Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation for these declining figures. // ' ' My wife is a career counselor here at the university , ' ' he says . ' ' When she talks to graduate students and even undergraduate women , the question is , ' Where do children fit into this ? ' Many of these women say they ' ll think about it later . Or they say , ' I ' m going to have them - someday . ' They ' re engineering themselves into a career path where that ' s going to be an increasingly difficult decision. ' ' // But Ms. Denbrook contends that present circumstances leave many women with two choices : ' ' not to have children , or to be a Supermom , which is an impossibility , an unrealistic pressure or expectation. ' ' // Joan Palmquist , a vice-president of a marketing-research firm in Minneapolis , is a case in point . ' ' I don ' t believe everybody should be a parent . The way I ' ve let my career go , I don ' t think a baby would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . ' ' Her voice grows wistful and her mixed feelings become apparent. // Sitting at an oak table in their dining room , where a teddy bear is propped on a child ' s chair in the corner , Ms. Palmquist and her husband , Randall Hildreth , who have been married four years , reflect on their ' ' focused ambivalence ' ' about having a child - a mood that led them to ' ' Baby Maybe. ' ' // At the moment , the couple is more focused , less ambivalent . On the assumption that they probably will not have a child of their own , they recently moved to a more expensive house in the suburbs , and they have started a college fund for several young nephews. // ' ' We have a good and happy life , ' ' Palmquist says . ' ' I don ' t think too many people will really believe I haven ' t achieved my full potential if I haven ' t become a mom . There are other ways to achieve . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision not to have children is a decision you have to constantly remake . We ' re constantly challenged by everything around us , ' ' Palmquist admits . Her husband , a manager at a car dealership , adds : ' ' It ' ll never really be over with and decided until the options are taken away from us. ' ' // As one exercise in the ' ' Baby Maybe ' ' class , couples are asked to draw up lists of what they expect to gain or lose by becoming a parent , and by remaining ' ' child free. ' ' // ' ' In every group , ' ' Denbrook observes , ' ' men have always made lists that are much more emotional , much more focused on the child already existing , on being able to love another thing who loves them back. ' ' // By contrast , ' ' the women focus much more on the risks of pregnancy and birth if they ' re older , on the effect on their careers , how parenting responsibilities will be shared or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 80s - to have a child or not to have a child - is so established that a debate has developed within the debate . What is the principal deterrent , the experts ask - the hesitation of individuals , uncertain of their life style , or the failure of society to support the family under new andmore demanding situations ? // Harold Howe II , a senior lecturer at the Graduate School of Education at Harvard University , places some responsibility on the individual . ' ' The self-interest of adults is moving center stage , and the interests of children are shoved toward the wings , ' ' he asserts. // Others , more pragmatic than philosophical , point to the lack of national policies on parental leave and day care. // ' ' The No. 1 problem of America ' s families today is child care , ' ' says Edward Zigler , director of the Bush Center in Child Development and Social Policy at Yale University , and former chief of the Children ' s Bureau under President Nixon , noting that more than half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force . The general confusion - both personal and social - has produced its sad ironies . Internal conflict and consequent postponement seem to be a factor contributing to an increase in infertility. // The American Medical Association estimates that more than 4. 5 million couples of childbearing age have been trying to conceive for more than a year and are experiencing problems. // To help some of those couples conceive , more than 125 infertility clinics throughout the country now offer advanced medical procedures in ' ' assisted reproduction ' ' - from fertility drugs and in-vitro fertilization to surrogate mothering and artificial insemination. // Never has the process of bringing on another generation seemed so complex. // Yet for many , the debate is a luxury they ' ll never know . Every year nearly half a million teen-age girls , most unmarried , give birth . Abortions continue to be the alternative way to end all discussions . And 11. 6 million women are so determined to prevent unwanted pregnancies that they or their partners have chosen surgical sterilization. // Having children , it may seem , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social critic Vance Packard , it ' ' has changed from being a part of the natural flow of life to . . . an act of courage. ' ' // ' ' I see these people who are so in angst about having children as thinking about them as objects , something that might be owned or possessed , and not something you can relate to as people , ' ' says Marc Reigel of Rochester , Minn. , a high school teacher and father of three. // Out of the sometimes hysterical pro-and-conning - should I or shouldn ' t I ? - a middle ground may be emerging. // ' ' One of the things we talk about in the ' Baby Maybe ' course is that there is never the ' right ' time to have a baby , ' ' says Denbrook. // ' ' You never have the right amount of money , your career is never in the right place , your relationship with your spouse is never in the perfect place to have a child . We try to get people to focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have a baby when you want to , when the time is ready for you emotionally . That ' s the most receptive time to become a parent. ' ' // For ambivalent couples who eventually decide to become parents , what seems to prevail are not the arguments but the timeless yearnings of the heart. // ' ' I had grown up seriously considering being child-free , ' ' says Sandi Younkin , a former participant in the ' ' Baby Maybe ' ' course and now its program coordinator and the mother of two . ' ' I had not always thought I would have children . So one of the most startling realizations for me was the intensity of my feeling for this child , the power this little child has over me.
