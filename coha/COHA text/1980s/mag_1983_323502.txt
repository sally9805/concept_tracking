On a reconstructed foot , Bill Walton is back in the game <P> " Pardon me , do you play basketball ? " " No , I clean giraffes ' ears . " <P> Bill Walton has grown up to be a happy if infirm basketball player of 6 ft. 11 in . " What 's it like being 7 ft. tall ? " asks the usual sightseer passing by , and Walton replies genially , " How should I know ? I 'm only 6-11 . " At 30 , he has learned to look on the bright side . <P> His left foot , the one made of bone china , that left him out of virtually all of the past four seasons , has been rebuilt . " Just being able to walk around is great , " Walton rejoices . " To go outside and throw a football with my kids four sons , to hit a tennis ball . Then , to top it all off , to play in the N.B.A. again . " He started back this season playing first once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who won only 17 of 82 National Basketball Association games last year and welcomed even part-time help . The rest of the time , Walton traveled north to study law at Stanford , inspired by the spectral array of lawsuits surrounding him . They include former San Diego Owner Irv Levin 's claim that Walton and his doctors should have warned Levin of the congenital foot problem in 1979 . Only in spirit was Walton the freest free agent , leader of the champion Portland Trail Blazers of 1976-77 , the N.B.A. 's most valuable player of 1977-78 , the vegetarian center from U.C.L.A. who gave the Establishment such pluperfect hell in the early ' 70s . <P> Easily the most complex , probably the most vulnerable , creatures in sports stand around 7 ft. tall . Whimsically , Wilt Chamberlain measured himself at 7 ft. 1 1/16 in. , though he was probably taller . From 1959 to 1973 , his incredible strength and gentleness were the two pivotal forces in professional basketball , and the second probably confounded Chamberlain as much as the Boston Celtics ' Bill Russell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50-point average one season , 100 points one game ) , the most remarkable and descriptive was that in 1,218 career games he never once fouled out . The basket was Chamberlain 's secondary goal ; the primary one was not to be an ogre . His enduring wisdom : " Nobody loves Goliath . " <P> Last month , when 7-ft. 4-in . Ralph Sampson of Virginia and 7-ft . Pat Ewing of Georgetown locked planes and angles for the first time , Celtics General Manager Red Auerbach observed , " These young guys actually love being tall . " He sounded amazed . " I love it now , " says Walton . " It took me a while to get used to standing out in the crowd , looking awkward , feeling uncomfortable . But I 've grown into it . " He has grown out of other things , condemning the Government , for instance , and has even developed some affection for meat . " I 've matured a lot . " This is his soft explanation for many changes . " There are still things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get more relaxed . " Quickly he adds , " I 'm still a concerned citizen . " But his voice is gentler .
