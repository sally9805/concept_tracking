Under the leadership of entertainment division chief Brandon Tartikoff and outgoing chairman Grant Tinker , NBC has exercised greater responsibility in programming and injected a sense of quality into the schedule in recent years and still has achieved mass-audience popularity . In many cases , the network has proved that **25;47238;TOOLONG programming is not the only road to commercial success . This year some of its new series reflect that philosophy , still all too rare in commercial television. // // Here is a rundown of the new shows. // L.A. Law is the most dynamic new series of the season . Co-created by Steven Bochco , a force behind ' ' Hill Street Blues , ' ' this show uses ' ' Hill Street ' s ' ' no-holds-barred style to dramatize the workings of a Los Angeles law firm . The interplay between the individuals ' sense of integrity , morality , and loyalty and the frequent lack of these qualities is the focus . A wide range of characters in overlapping stories keeps viewers on their toes . There is much gritty action , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But skill and sensitivity are apparent in the writing. // Our House is a show that could force ' ' 60 Minutes ' ' and ' ' The Sunday Disney Movie ' ' to look to their laurels . This little heartwarmer of a series may be a sleeper . It ' s familiar stuff : A lonely grandpa decides to invite his widowed daughter-in-law and her three children to live with him . Though warned that ' ' If it isn ' t on a cassette , modern kids don ' t relate , ' ' he is determined to give them discipline and values . And he is willing to fight for the right of his teen-age granddaughter to become an astronaut , despite sexist pressures . Wilford Brimley is just right as the outspoken granddad . He manages to make the series a charming , if slightly saccharine , Sunday night love-feast for the whole family. // 1986 has made it to the weekly schedule after some occasional specials . This no-kidding-around newsmagazine plans to leave the disco-beat stories to CBS ' s ' ' West 57th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most part . The show will feature co-hosts Connie Chung and Roger Mudd . Arrangements are reportedly in the works to add Maria Shriver Schwartzenegger to the staff as special correspondent . Word is that Lawrence K. Grossman , president of NBC ' s news division , plans to stay with the show until it catches on , just as CBS rode it out with ' ' 60 Minutes ' ' for many years. // Matlock stars Andy Griffith as the charming Atlanta lawyer , Ben Matlock , the main character in a special last March called ' ' Diary of a Perfect Murder . ' ' Matlock is a Harvard-educated country lawyer . Producer Fred Silverman , who has had lots of experience choosing new series as chief programmer at all three networks in the past , has been fiddling with the premiere up until the last moment . So it was not available for screening at press time . But how wrong can it go with veteran Andy Griffith in the lead ? // Crime Story is a fast-moving , fast-talking , stylish crime serial about Chicago hoods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of attention because its executive producer is Michael Mann , who gave NBC ' ' Miami Vice . ' ' Mr. Mann insists that the series will not be as turbulent as its pilot , which I found to be one of the most savage films ever prepared for TV viewing , with its slick , sickening violence . Mann maintains there ' s no blood on camera . But bloodless violence can be just as repulsive as the other variety . The pilot tends to strive for a measure of chicness ; at one point , for instance , the hero , when viewing a dead body says , completely out of character : ' ' It looks like a Jackson Pollock . ' ' ' ' Crime Story ' ' is full of hateful people , and it ' s often difficult to tell the difference between the heroes and villains. // Amen brings TV ' s Mr. Jefferson ( Sherman Hemsley ) back in a new incarnation , this time as a cantankerous Philadelphia deacon constantly sparring with a new minister ( Clifton Davis ) . Believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choirmaster . Most of the gags are based on familiar ' ' thank you , Lord ' ' stereotypical black humor , but there ' s the added bite of the deacon ' s negativism and dubious ethics . Aside from its questionable look at one segment of black middle-class society , the main asset of this thin , new series is executive producer Ed Weinberg , whose talents helped craft ' ' Maude ' ' and ' ' The Cosby Show . ' ' Maybe he can pull this one together , too. // Easy Street could have been called ' ' Three ' s a Weird Crowd . ' ' An ex-showgirl ( Loni Anderson ) invites her uncle and his black sidekick to leave their room in a retirement home and share her mansion in Beverly Hills . Also living in the house are her late husband ' s very proper sister and brother-in-law . They are shocked by the uncle ' s crudity . It ' s outrageous , offbeat comedy in which the situation is often funnier than the lines. // ALF looks like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandered into prime time . ALF ( short for ' ' Alien Life Form ' ' ) is a Muppetlike extraterrestrial from the planet Melmac , who looks like a cross between a kangaroo and an aardvark . His space ship crashes into the roof of a typical American home . You can tell it ' s typical because Dad says to the kids : ' ' If we don ' t respect the rules , how can we respect each other ? Have we learned nothing from watching ' The Cosby Show ' ? ' ' Obviously the producers haven ' t found the ' ' The Cosby Show ' ' very enlightening , because ' ' ALF ' ' is childish , obvious , simplistic . On Saturday morning , it might have been more appealing than cartoon fare among the moppets , who would be likely to beg mom and dad for an ALF doll . But on Monday nights , it will be up against one of the best-written shows on TV , ' ' Kate And Allie ' ' on CBS . Watch that instead. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade of seasons on the commercial networks , that ' s because it is : lots of mindless entertainment , very little of substance . If you want more solid viewing mixed in with your entertainment , the PBS season starts next month . <> <> Show times // Here is a schedule for the series previewed in the accompanying article : // ALF , Mondays , 8-8 : 30 p. m. , starting Sept. 22. // Amen , Saturdays , 9 : 30-10 p. m. , starting Sept. 27. // Crime Story , Tuesdays , 9-10 p. m. , previews Sept. 18 , 19 , and 26 , then moves to regular time Sept. 30. // Easy Street , Sundays , 8-8 : 30 p. m. , previews Sept. 20 , 9 : 30-10 p. m. and then moves to regular time Sept. 28. // L.A.
