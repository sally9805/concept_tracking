At a luncheon last fall , Robert Fomon , the hard-charging chairman and chief executive officer of E.F. Hutton &; Co . Inc. , went up to William French Smith , the attorney general at the time . He wanted to discuss the investigation that had been going on for more than three years into the massive check-kiting operation run by Hutton ' s cash-management manipulators . This high-level approach has troubled some professionals within the Justice Department . Along with 15 Democratic senators , they believe it was wrong to allow the well-connected company to cop a guilty plea without prosecuting any of the individual wrongdoers . When asked about this episode , officials at Justice gulp and confirm what they consider an improper attempt to influence the case . " The attorney general felt sandbagged , " says Stephen Trott , chief of the Criminal Division . " He was furious . " Nobody will say exactly how Smith reported the Fomon contact to his colleagues at Justice . But the pressure was noticed then , and in light of the subsequent decision to let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the subject of concern now . According to Robert Ogren , the Criminal Division deputy who recommended the case be settled without individual indictments , the approach was " a serious breach of standards . " The eminent criminal attorney hired by Hutton for its defense , William Hundley , later apologized for his client ' s action , which he may have known about beforehand and recommended against . That is the specific basis for the feeling inside Justice that the disposition of the case might have been overly friendly , and that a gang of white-collar crooks has been allowed to go scot-free . In the Criminal Division , Trott ( as a youth , a member of a singing group called the Highwaymen , who made famous " Michael , Row the Boat Ashore " ) and Ogren , a career prosecutor , vigorously dispute this , insisting that their plea bargain helped save America ' s banking system . But the brief chat between the Hutton CEO and the attorney general surely should have sensitized Justice to the appearance of case-fixing , especially if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal liability . Evidently no such sensitizing took place . John Shad , for example , was vice chairman of E.F. Hutton when the fraudulent back-room dealings began in earnest , and the firm ' s profits were inflated by interest in effect stolen from hundreds of banks . He was named chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission by Ptesident Reagan eight months after the crimes began . Investigators spoke to him , and say his company responsibilities were not in the cash-management area ; but the fact that a former top official of an admittedly guilt-ridden firm is now at the head of Wall Street ' s watchdog agency should surely have caused Justice to examine him at length under oath before a grand jury . Scott Pierce , for another example , is now president of E.F. Hutton and was assigned to oversee retail branches in Hutton ' s hot summer of 1982 , when the extent of the federal and local investigations became known internally , when the corporate officers were shaken up and when Hutton ' s president , George Ball , left to take over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well aware , is Vice President George Bush ' s brother-in-law . That is not in itself a state of sin . However , if Pierce ' s boss was willing to take the case directly to the attorney general , it seems possible to me that the same boss might suggest that Pierce talk to his sister Barbara ' s husband . It happens that Pierce did not : Bush , responding promptly to my query , avers he never discussed the E.F. Hutton case with anybody at the company or in the government . The Justice Department , curiously , never saw fit to make this obvious inquiry , even after the Fomon approach to Smith . One dismaying reason that Justice puts forward for not rowing that boat ashore is that nobody in the Criminal Division knew , until last week , that the president of their target company was brother-in-law to the vice president of the United States . The questions : Did Hutton use any of its connections in getting off without prosecutions ? Why , after three years , the sudden rush to settle as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Congress , but assuming no venality , one point is plain : Letting so many white-collar lawbreakers go free was a colossal misjudgment.
