Too Many People ? <P> To the Editors : <P> TIME is to be commended for its coverage of " The Population Curse " WORLD , Aug. 6 . Our solutions to all other world problems will fail if too many people are allowed to overcrowd the globe . <P> Brent White Newhall , Calif . <P> <P> The Reagan Administration 's policy of denying funds for family planning to countries that sanction abortion is hypocritical and pathetically shortsighted . Abortions will be decreased only by providing these nations with better methods for preventing conception . <P> <P> Nancy J. Treat Morgantown , W. Va . <P> <P> Finally someone has said it : the threat to human existence comes not from thermonuclear weapons but from the proliferation of our own species . <P> <P> Robert A. France Oxnard , Calif . <P> <P> Your cover phrase " The Population Curse " is insensitive and callous . People should never be viewed as a curse . <P> <P> ( The Rev. ) F. Douglas Morgan Sr. Dillon , S.C . <P> <P> Your report misses a central point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are better off than the rural poor . It is essential to increase rural productivity through land reform and technology . Otherwise , attempts to improve our population centers will further widen the urban-rural gap and lead to even higher migration into cities , thus nullifying whatever improvements are made in those metropolitan areas . <P> <P> Raaj Kumar Sah New Haven , Conn . <P> <P> Research on birth rates shows that along with strengthening planned-parenthood programs , each country has to carry out additional strategies to slow the growth of population and urbanization . If infant and child mortality were reduced and if social security for the elderly were introduced , couples would not feel the need to have many sons with the hope that one or two would survive to care for the parents in their old age . Similarly , literacy , especially for women , would help delay the age of marriage and would also bring greater understanding and acceptance of family-planning methods . <P> <P> Moni Nag , Senior Associate The Population Council New York City <P> It is amazing how our Government can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is , that people constitute a growing market . By impeding efforts to limit the number of births , the Administration is condemning more and more individuals to death through starvation . <P> <P> Thomas Pirko Niles , Ohio <P> By supporting a church that teaches that contraception is a sin , we Catholics are contributing to a system that brings premature death and suffering to millions . Could it be that contemporary American Catholics are as blind and self-serving as were the sincere Christian slave owners of the 18th and 19th centuries ? <P> <P> Paschal Baute Lexington , Ky . <P> <P> Your story on overpopulation propagates a myth that serves to justify abortion , infanticide and euthanasia . The facts simply do not support your dire assertions . If all the people of the world were brought together in one place , they could stand , without touching , in less than 400 sq . mi.
