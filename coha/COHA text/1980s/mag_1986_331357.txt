The eye accepted what the mind could not : a sudden burst of white and yellow fire , then white trails streaming up and out from the fireball to form a twisted Y against a pure heaven , and the metal turning to rags , dragging white ribbons into the ocean . A terrible beauty exploded like a primal event of physics  --  the birth of a universe ; the death of a star ; a fierce , enigmatic violence out of the blue . The mind recoiled in sheer surprise . Then it filled with horror . <P> One thought first of the teacher and her children  --  her own and her students . One wanted to snatch them away from the sight and rescind the thing they had seen . But the moment was irrevocable . Over and over , the bright extinction played on the television screen , almost ghoulishly repeated until it had sunk into the collective memory . And there it will abide , abetted by the weird metaphysics of videotape , which permits the endless repetition of a brute finality . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little brusquely , and asked whether the nation would be pitched into such mourning if , say , a 747 went down with 300 Americans . Chuck Yeager , protohero of the space age , observed , " I do n't see any difference , except for the public exposure of the shuttle , between this accident and one involving a military or a commercial airplane . " <P> That had the machismo of matter-of-factness . It is true that the tragedy played itself out to maximum dramatic effect : the shuttle , now boringly routine , lifting off and then annihilating itself in full view of the world . It is true that television pitched itself fervently into what has become its sacramental role in national tragedies  --  first wounding with its vivid repetitions of the event , then consoling , grieving , reconciling , administering the anchor 's unctions . It is true that Christa McAuliffe , a teacher representing all the right things in America , rode as a nonprofessional , an innocent , into space , and her death therefore seemed doubly poignant and unfair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound event than that suggests . It inflicted upon Americans the purest pain that they have collectively felt in years . It was a pain uncontaminated by the anger and hatred and hungering for revenge that come in the aftermath of terrorist killings , for example . It was pain uncomplicated by the divisions , political , racial , moral , that usually beset American tragedies ( Viet Nam and Watergate , to name two ) . The shuttle crew , spectacularly democratic ( male , female , black , white , Japanese American , Catholic , Jewish , Protestant ) , was the best of us , Americans thought , doing the best of things Americans do . The mission seemed symbolically immaculate , the farthest reach of a perfectly American ambition to cross frontiers . And it simply vanished in the air .
