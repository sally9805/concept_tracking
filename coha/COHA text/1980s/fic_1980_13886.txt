MAN COSTUMED LIKE THE LEGENDARY DEVIL , WITH HORNS AND TAIL Why are you standing there , operating that infernal machine ? @x ( Steps out of the shadows ) Shall we pause a moment to consider what is going on here , folks ? You and I have a common interest in this man , I believe , for we both want to take his soul , as the saying goes . Many of you have said the prayer in early childhood , and said it in good faith , sometimes totally indifferent to its awful implications and sometimes terrified of them . Now I lay me down to sleep . I pray the Lord my soul to keep . If I should die before I wake , I pray the Lord my soul to take . Well , I suppose I myself was never asked to make that prayer , although I am sure that being who I am I must have been asked to make something like a prayer of the same sort , only not quite so cheerful , if I may put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you see , traveling , and we wonder why , for he is also seventy-two years old , also that is not to confuse the matter of his identity or character , for that can not be done , he is still this boy , perhaps we might say , Our Boy , and I want to grab him away from the Lord and make him totally one of us , a disgrace to the human race , which is really the only thing for an honorable man or woman to be , and so far one is tempted to suspect that this boy is not a disgrace , or if a disgrace , only a small disgrace and not worth noticing seriously , as the saying is . Who does he think he is to go around the world still a boy , still stupid as a boy is , still atrociously ill-mannered instead of murderously polite as the human race swiftly learns how to be in order to avoid being stopped in its tracks right where it runs . He is still a damned fool , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is told , he sometimes believes he is not only corrupt , like everybody else , like myself , and yourselves , you the people out there in literary land , theatre land , fantasy land , audience land , circus land , society land , radio land , television land , newspaper land , and so on and so forth , why should I give myself a headache naming the various lands in which we dwell , or believe we do ? He talks to anybody who happens to be within hearing range , and frequently enough when he believes he is talking to somebody he was talking to a moment ago he suddenly notices that no , this is somebody else , somebody who may not even understand English , but he goes right on talking , for if the truth is told he really is n't talking to anybody in particular , he is either talking to himself or to God , or to my own Emperor , you know  --  hell fire , I 'm just one of the millions of picayune little agents who are always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this stupid assignment . Follow that man , hear him , if he notices you , if he speaks to you , speak back , keep track of where he goes and what he does , he 's dying , he knows it , he does n't believe it , he seems to believe that death is not death , it is more of the same , life , which he also seems to believe is not life , although it is all the human race has , and all he also has . So far he has been clearly rather tired , apparently near exhaustion , and he hears telephone bells when none are ringing , and when one telephone bell actually rings he answers it and talks to somebody who apparently is actually at the other end of the line , if we are willing to believe in telephones , and frankly although we are I sometimes wonder  --  are n't they indeed elements of the fantasy that has taken over the dimensions of reality . But when he spoke to somebody who must surely have been his daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so it was when he spoke to somebody who must surely have been his son  --  both of these people out of his seed , as the saying goes , and out of the womb of the woman who received his seed out of total ignorance of the real consequences although there was never any anxiety about male seed meeting female egg or ovum or whatever it is , and it was clearly a joyousness to him when the girl swelled and when the son was delivered of her , and a few years later again when the girl was manufactured in the same traditional manner and was delivered in the same manner . They were , he has frequently said to himself , wonder kids of the human race , they were indeed at last his own human race , and coming of his seed , never mind whose ovum had worked with the seed , this human race was superior  --  and that was when I nearlyhad him , for when a man is that stupid about himself and his answers to all of the questions and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , especially the unknown and unknowable past of his thousands of ancestors , oh , that is when my job is amusing , and when I know it is going to be no struggle at all for me to rope in another half-wit father  --  yes , mark that word : father . Mothers are different , good God how different they are , they can rape their sons and daughters alike and never know it at all . But only fathers are arrogant about the new human race they are propagating , poor bastards . Look at him go . p. 10 MOUSTACHE Well , let 's tell the story , shall we folks , this is now room 318 at the Hotel Europejski in Warsaw , and the time is 5:15 of the same day , the day that began in Mainz . It does n't take long to get from anywhere to anywhere , and this does not mean anything else . It only means that if you go on board an airplane chances are now very good that you will soon reach another place , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that you were served a kind of big meal or small meal or snack or Continental breakfast depending upon the amount of time to be used up during the flight  --  but look here , look here , you 're standing back there by the door to the bath , what is it , old buddy boy ? THE DEVIL ( Now as doctor in white robe ) Well , if you say so , I suppose it is so , but at the moment you are alone , and I must tell you that anything you say will not be used against you , so if you believe it might do you some kind of good to curse me , or any doctor at all , or the whole medical profession , or science itself , or measurable information , or whatever you want to call it , please feel free to do so , for we have also learned that the sighs and groans of people serve an excellent purpose , makes them feel a little less captured , as it were . MOUSTACHE Oh ho , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the shy silent intelligent Armenian born in Alexandria , oh I suppose 40 years or so ago , are you ? Well , that 's fine , that 's fine , and it is n't that I have any real quarrel with you , or with medicine men , witch doctors , voodoo boys , or with theories of therapy , theories of health , of disease , of life , of non-life , of super-life , but once again I have got to say what I said when you told me it would appear that I have cancer  --  of the prostate . I do n't think so , Doc , because I always refer to any Doctor as Doc , and you said nothing , so I knew you believed your finger diagnosis was correct and my natural repudiation of it was incorrect . And so I told myself instantly , Christ , now I 've got cancer . I mean everything is swift , everything is instantly true or untrue , everything happens in the instant : the start of life , the stop of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to say , though , is that notwithstanding Medicare and Blue Cross and insurance and anything else , doctors and nurses and hospitals cost too much . I told you once , I 'll tell you again , You young doctors all over the country want to become millionaires in ten years . p. 11 THE DEVIL Five . MOUSTACHE That 's right , and I rather admire your honesty , so with me it 's myself tagged but with you it 's another source of good big easy money , and while I ca n't say I begrudge you the million surely almost already stashed in the bank or in an orange grove up above Lake Wahtoke somewhere or in house and garden , in mansion with pool and gardener where the rich people live , I live where the poor people live , you know , while I really am delighted that you are doing well I do n't like the diagnosis which already is established  --  one second after its declaration  --  and has already killed me , if you wo n't mind the silly word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , I have cancer , in my language , it is myself that I have , another variation of myself . Every man is born of his tribe , accident , and mystery , and dies of himself , but again the word dies is theoretic , we put it that way because if we did n't we might not be able to communicate by speech at all  --  and would n't that be the day . All in total silence , by means of eye and a few other things  --  posture , movement , gesture , scent , sigh , silence , silence , all informing us of the unstated truth . Well , it 's all right , Doc , but right now I have got to receive my interpreter , everybody gets an interpreter in Warsaw , and I got the best of the lot , Martha Mularuk , who is on her way here to get me to the American Ambassador 's big cocktail party for me , for Ms. Rye , for Mr. Lish , for forty-four American people of the theatre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so right now I have got to get into my dark suit and you 've got to get back into you own realm , am I right , as we say ? So I 've got cancer , so what ? I 've got it in the prostate , so what ? Did n't the sweet Mexican lady who mopped the floor of my private room at the Sierra Hospital say , Oh , that 's nothing . My father had it , he died of something else ? And did n't our old pal Doc Leo himself say , Well , if you 've got to have cancer , that 's a good place to have it ? I mean , what 's the big deal ? ( Knock ) Come in , come in. p. 12 MULARUK I thought you were on the phone , who were you talking to ? MOUSTACHE Myself . God . I was trying out some lines for a play . p. 13 Act 1 , Scene 4 SCENE 4 MOUSTACHE Cocktail party . In Warsaw . At the American Embassy itself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic of Mongolia , and I wish to Christ I were there , not here . Actually this may not be the embassy itself , it may be the home of the Ambassador , and he is a damned nice man , let 's get that straight at the outset , for such matters are important , are they not ? I should say so . I have his name some place but it 's not in my head , or memory , it 's on the card the pretty interpreter passed along to me when we went down to the lobby of the Europejski ( I ca n't pronounce Polish spelling of words , that 's all , and right now Poles are in the American government and in the Roman Catholic Church , as we all know ) . SCHNEIDER Bill , you never get old , do you ? Remember me ? Alan Shoulder , we met in New York thirty years ago , and then twenty years ago , and once it was at the poor rich boy 's who had to be in the theatre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Godot , and he hired me to stage it , and I did , and it won all the prizes . Alan Shoulder ? MOUSTACHE Schneider , why do you keep saying Shoulder ? SCHNEIDER You keep hearing Shoulder  --  is your shoulder broken ? I keep saying Schneider , you keep hearing shoulder . What is it ? p. 14 MOUSTACHE It 's the acoustics , you do n't get acoustics at cocktail parties in Warsaw the way you used to get acoustics . Of course I remember you , man , you are one of the best all-around directors of plays in America . Michael Myerberg said , What about this play Waiting for Godot , and I said , Produce it , lose some of your money , it 's a great play , but do you know I never knew until this minute that you directed it , although I was glad to hear that Bert Lahr played Estragon or the other bum , I never got them straight , and I do n't suppose Samuel Beckett ever did either . One was nearly the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than five or six people in the play , counting the small boy , and they were all the same , that would be fun . What are you doing in Poland ? You have n't moved back , have you ? I mean , Darryl Zanuck used to kid around about some of his hired help , his stooges , and one of his favorite expressions was , I wish he 'd go back to Poland . I suppose Darryl Zanuck 's grandfather or somebody came from Poland , do you suppose ? I mean , what are you doing here at this cocktail , as we say in Paris . This is a command appearance for me , as we say , and I arrived only a short time ago from Frankfurt  --  did you ever get a room at a hotel in Frankfurt  --  I have never met a human being who has , although when I went to the Book Fair a couple of years ago I was told that an American writer had a suite not just a room at one of the bigger and newer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Alex Haley or Alex Vonnegut or Alex Buchwald . I was told to be here , so I 'm here . p. 15 SCHNEIDER So was I. Who told you ? MOUSTACHE Martha Mularuk told me , that 's who , and I 'm sure you must know who she is . My own private interpreter . Who told you ? SCHNEIDER Somebody like that , but let me tell you something  --  again , I mean , you never change , you do n't grow old , you 'll live to be a hundred . I 'm old , I 'm tired , and I look it , do n't I ? MOUSTACHE You look the same as ever , as I remember it , but who are all these intense screaming people all around ? SCHNEIDER Oh , they 're theatre people , mostly from non-commercial , from schools , from little non-profit places that get funded from the big new Santa Claus in Washington . MOUSTACHE Is that you speaking that way , or is that me thinking that way . I mean , you 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have n't you ? Did John Kennedy start all that , and if he did should we be enchanted or should we feel the way I do . They should have all taken jobs at the supermarkets , there is more real theatre at the checkout stand than in any of their theatres . How much money did Mike Myerberg lose on Waiting for Godot ? Twenty thousand dollars ? SCHNEIDER Lose ? He made money . And I 'm suing the estate ; they still have n't paid me or given me a small percentage , the rats . p. 16 MOUSTACHE We call them ratons , it 's Spanish , means rats . SCHNEIDER By God , you 'll live to be a hundred . MOUSTACHE Either I already have , and maybe twice over , or you are mistaken . I 'm tagged , I 'm performing robust health , and it is very wearing to do that . Give me an audience , even of one , with two dozen hanging around listening , like right here , and I 've got to perform , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mission in the world , would n't you . Well , maybe I do , maybe I do , maybe it 's true . SAROYAN Now , ladies and gentlemen , by your leave , and all that stuff , the writer himself comes out of the woodwork and enters into the play and perhaps even into the spirit of it , for as we know anything is possible if anybody says so , and everybody these days is saying so , from little infants just beginning to put four or five words together into sentences of protest , as a rule , although now and then the beautiful little creatures , or should we say monsters , lapse into poetry , of sorts . And so now I say I am the writer , I am not any of the others so far in this play , I am the writer of it , by name Saroyan , first name William , not Aram , or Petros as the name might have been after the father 's father instead of William after the father 's friend who went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Protestant or non-denominational Reality  --  rather than Hell , Earth , Life , Place , Confusion , Confabulation , or Theory , to name only a few of the words and meanings which might be easily placed upon where we are once we are born and have not yet died . But why have I come out of the shadows into the glare of the lights or even the sharper or sharpest glare of the spotlight in this manner ? What do I mean by it ? And how is this to serve you , the people , about whom all of the concern of everything and everybody , all science , reason , and art has gathered like bees about the Queen in the hive  --  ugly , really , you know , as so much of nature is , and one of the reasons for art in the first place , most likely ? I have done this , this coming out of the woodwork and shadows because frankly it has seemed to me something right to do , although I expect this rightness soon enough to settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do  --  we , mind you , not nature , for while we are stuck to nature helplessly we also have always been compelled to believe we are free of it , we are not like the animals , the plants , and the inert rocks , and all the rest of it : we are man , man himself , male and female , each in place , each habitually stuck together for continuance in the very manner of the animals , in the continuation of nature 's force and truth , and we do things nature is unable to do , never mind that nature has no reason to reason , no need to laugh , no wish to manufacture balances and proportions and rhythms , for it has them all and has always had them  --  but there is the traveler in this play , the old man in the old body , with the sad old face and the enormous old white moustache , and is he not myself , is he not Saroyan of the tribe which lived for centuries in the Highlands of Armenia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , of course he is , but he damned well is n't , too , and if the truth is told , and here comes the fun , I myself right here right now at this very moment am not he who I say I am , I am not the actual man named Saroyan , I am either an actor performing a part in a play , this play , or even if I myself , that is William Saroyan himself happens to do this part , and it is n't very likely in this world or the next , I would still not be William Saroyan of the rest of the Truth , so to put it , I would be a performance , and the fun quickens when we understand that even in the rest of the Truth , in the Truth of world and reality themselves I am a performer and always have been , and so have you , dear soul , whoever you are , man or woman , boy or girl , we have no choice , and if we do n't seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also is acting , if you can follow , and I am sure you can , although I am not willing to believe that you should . That matter of what any of us ought to choose to do or think , and how or when and so on , is the good big matter of our way and probable truth , but one thing at a time , please , I say to myself . We are all fast asleep , you know , at this meeting , in this play , whether it is being performed or read or even ignored , we are all of us always part of a continuation of ancient human sleep , distinguished from the sleep of sheep , in that we the people remember however indistinctly everything we experience in sleep , century after century , and here we are doing a very very small amount of it in the English language , which is at best relatively a new one and only occasionally the means to something like a satisfactory summing up of all of the stuff that arrives so abundantly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even then for only an instant of the charge of it all upon us as we meander to the end of the road , as I am meandering at this very moment , both in the play and in the body , in mind and memory  --  Lord , I am near the end of my 72nd year , to what do I owe this incredible distinction , and how shall I use it most effectively ? Is it by the writing of this play and the entering into it in person as it were ? Yes , that would appear to be so , and I thank you . p. 17 MOUSTACHE So now we have met himself , the playwright , and as the saying goes we have seen everything . It just is n't done , but it has been done , so on with the dance . Here is this little girl at the Fresno Court House park Sunday night concert dancing up front because the music wo n't permit her to stand still . Well , she is a fish in sweet water , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know . Fade fade fade fade , fade out O shade of truth , in the rockpool are little fish and ferns and water-skaters and the two eyes of each of us studying the language of that perfection and silence . Here now we are at the University of Warsaw , three of us from places in America , answering the questions of students of the English language . May I ask , ladies and gentlemen , young women and young men , boys and girls , how many of you are writers , kindly raise your hands . Not one hand , so I presume every one of you is a writer but a shy writer , and I congratulate you on your shyness , it is better to be shy at the beginning of a career than at the end , for that , as you see , is the time for pride and noise . You , then , ask your question , and one or another of us here will see to the answering of it . WOMAN I would like to ask Elena Rye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition to it  --  from your family , for instance , or from your teachers , or from your friends , or from society at large ? p. 18 RYE That is a very complicated question , is n't it ? I wonder if I can begin to answer even a little of it , because you see MAN We ca n't hear you , could you speak up just a little , perhaps ? RYE I was asked if anybody did n't believe I ought to write , and I began to say I do n't quite know how to answer the question , because in my WOMAN We still ca n't hear you , we who are here at the back of the hall . RYE Because in my family there was always an atmosphere of rather pleasant enthusiasm about whatever any of us imagined we might like to do . I hope you can hear me , but if you ca n't I 'm afraid we must imagine that the loudspeakers are not working properly . Is that possible ? No , I do n't believe I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course I tried to keep the matter to myself , for at the very beginning I myself wanted to know if I could indeed take my ambition seriously , and the only way I could find out was to write and then carefully consider what I had written . I found that from the very beginning it was always a kind of unaccountable baroque or highly ornamental order of writing which in turn carried me rather helplessly into areas of human experience that surprised even me  --  terrible malevolence among unexpected people , ravenous appetites , horrible crimes , betrayals , conspiracies of the most terrible kind , and there I was , writing it all , there I was the author of it all . I hope I have n't made a reply that is useless to the person who asked the question and confusing to some of the rest of you . I suspect , from the question , that the asker has experienced opposition from one or two quarters , possibly society at large , or even the state , if I may put it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Buddington , When you write a poem do you know what you want to say ? BUDDINGTON Well , it just so happens that I have in this book a poem that rather neatly answers that question  --  if I can find it . MOUSTACHE While Mr. Buddington is turning pages back and forth looking for the poem that answers the question , perhaps I can mention that Carl Sandburg at his home in Harbert , Michigan on the Lake asked me to go with him to a cocktail party at a neighbor 's house , and when we got there he opened his last book of poems , The People , Yes , and began to read , or chant , the first seven or eight lines . The seventy or eighty people in the room stopped their happy drinking and chatting with one another to listen to the poet , for they expected him to read for no longer than half a minute , but after two full hours he stopped reading because he had read every line in the whole book , the room was empty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Buddington ? BUDDINGTON Well , I 've forgotten the question , and the poem I thought I was looking for . What was it that I was asked ? MAN When you write a poem do you know what you 're doing ? BUDDINGTON Well , I suppose so , I mean if a poet thinks it is time to write a poem , he thinks he knows that he wants to write a poem . p. 20 WOMAN Why did Carl Sandburg read the whole book ? MOUSTACHE Well , I believe he was exhausted from having just finished his biography of Lincoln . Edmund Wilson wrote that the worst thing that ever happened to Lincoln was for Carl Sandburg to write his life . p. 21 Act 1 , Scene 5 SCENE 5 THE DEVIL ( In full regalia ) Well , it 's my turn again , as we see , do n't we ? Something is going on here that is far less than meets the eye , or so I once heard somebody brilliant say about one or another of William Shakespeare 's revered plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Dream , perhaps Coriolanus , what do we care about such details , our job is to bring down the human race in total disgrace , if I may : race and disgrace , that is : any English teacher will tell you that such a piece of doggerel rhyme just wo n't do . At any rate , a story is being told in play form , possibly even on a stage with actors , possibly only in a book , with only one reader , about somebody or other who has a name and something like several aliases , so to put it . Who is he ? Well , we could certainly say , Sir , he is yourself . Who is Hamlet excepting each of us reading his lines and the play in which he figures . Well , as you surely must remember , we had no trouble with Hamlet at all , he was fair game from the word go and easy to bring down along with just about everybody else in his world supposedly because his mother had gone to work and entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor nincompoop of a sad silly fellow . We brought down Hamlet and the whole human race like child 's play , which of course the play itself is . A grown man carrying on like a silly petulant child and nobody to say briskly , Stop it . Although it was only three or four hundred years ago that Shakespeare wrote his plays the human race has failed to produce a successor , and it may very well be that this has been a blessing for if the truth is told all art needs its time and culture , and for at least a century we have got another kind of society and meaning and connection to everything unresolved and so our art is entirely different , is n't it . Try to think what Leonardo would have thought of the art of Picasso . Would he not have said , Sir , I say Sir , shame on you , and get away from me , that 's all , just get as far away from me as possible . With me , simply a poor agent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , it is another Get entirely : Get thee hence , that is to say . Satan , get thee hence . Oh , how the righteous fear being seduced in any one of its dozens of ways , but always thinking of the most obvious ways and all the way being far gone into the more complicated ways  --  virtue itself , boys and girls , is fraudulent , as we began to suspect from the first day of study , did we not ? I say Sir , Sir , did we not ? p. 22 MOUSTACHE Jesus , ca n't a man lie down and rest in the afternoon of a hard day in Warsaw , in Poland , without having you take stage center front and start blathering all over the place ? You 're a clown , do you know ? THE DEVIL Do you say a clown does not know a thing or two ? Then , Sir , I say Sir right back to you , widen the range of your reading , for a careful reading of everybody 's story , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best biographers tell it , is the story of a clown . Surely you know that , and furthermore I would most likely find myself horrified if you were not willing to acknowledge that you yourself are a clown and always have been , everything you did made the human race laugh , so far as the race was near enough to observe . Deny it . You ca n't . And it is still going on . Before you open your big mouth to say something people are so sure it is going to be comic that they break into laughter . It happened again and again this afternoon while the other two members of the literary panel tried to restore order to the overall situation . If you want stage center , by God , it is yours , I only fill in now and then , and I must say I enjoy doing so . Shall I go back into the crowded shadows and wait or shall we chat a bit ? MOUSTACHE I told you I 'm tired , and I 've got a big and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers of Warsaw , carefully chosen of course , with lots of pouring of drinks and lots of pork  --  they 've got no beef , I hate pork except when it is roasted by the Chinese , especially of San Francisco , and then it is no longer pork as we know it , it is something created the way art is . And of course I shall strain and strain to hear first what the boys and girls are saying in Polish and then when Martha Mularuk  --  do n't I find that name irresistible , though ?  --  puts it all into English , which , although rather correct , to me either sounds like Polish also or like something said in a language entirely beyond the range of philology . Talk away , clown , I have got to rest some more , I do n't want to chat at all . p. 23 THE DEVIL Well , I was only saying , Here in Warsaw we have this old fool of an American writer , by way of Armenia , the highland city of Bitlis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performing as if he were himself in 1935 when he first arrived back in Europe and crossed Poland and spent a night in Lvov or Lemberg . What 's eating the boy ? Why does he want to perform at all ? MOUSTACHE The days of travel are easy days but they are hard days , too . They are much harder , almost , than the days of full leisure , when a man can choose how he is to take up one minute to the next for twenty-four hours , and suddenly discovers that so much absence of tension is a source of much tension of another order . So what do you do , what do you do ? Well , what I did was go where the program told me to go and I must say the work of it was easy , it was fun , it was nothing , and it was for a good cause . Literature . By God , I enjoy saying that . Think of it . Literature . Here I am a published writer for nearly half a century and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing is n't , although mainly it is . That is a very large if tiny thing , do n't you think ? It certainly amuses me to try to guess what I seem to the various people of Warsaw I have met so far as well as the people on the program fetched here by Usica , as I have said : a sick running together of first letters of five words which mean simply United States International Communication Agency  --  hoo boy , it 's fun , is it not . Usica . No , you do n't sica , boys and girls , ladies and gentlemen , all you do is go from place to place and drink and eat and talk and try to hear what the main people are saying  --  in the form of questions directed to you .

And if ever there was a question suitable for an answer by anybody under the age of eight that is it .
