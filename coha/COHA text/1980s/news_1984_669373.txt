Their advice on your financial dress : Don ' t take off your sweater yet , remain diversified , don ' t commit yourself too heavily to common stocks , or bonds , or cash , or any other investments . But do take advantage of periods of market weakness to upgrade your investments - or to cut your losses. // Normally conservative Value Line , which has hewn hard for many months to a position that says the market is heading higher , recently reversed its advice to subscribers. // ' ' Hold off buying stocks until further notice , ' ' it said earlier this month . ' ' Should the market rally that began Friday , Feb. 24 , continue up to the 1 , 180-1 , 200 area of the Dow , sell some of the stocks to build a cash reserve. ' ' // Such advice has been common at brokerage houses the past few weeks , indicating the confusing crosscurrents that have been raking the stock market . The widespread advice to sell into market rallies ( Value Line was worried especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of the dollar ) seems destined to keep the Dow Jones industrial average from sustaining a new bullish phase in the near future. // But hope springs eternal . In the longer run , virtually all analysts agree , the market is heading higher . John M. Templeton , president of the mutual fund group that bears his name , believes the market will more than double in value by 1988 . Fueling much of the increase , he says , will be higher corporate earnings - especially of blue-chip companies - and a projected rise of pension fund assets from $800 billion this year to $3 trillion by 1995. // Mr. Templeton sees the Dow Jones industrial average growing 20 percent per year . He expects bonds , too , to increase in value if inflation remains in the 4 percent range. // Richard Benson of J. J. Lowrey &; Co. , an investment banking firm , is an unbridled optimist on bonds . He sees ' ' a good bond-buying opportunity at hand . ' ' The next big move by the Federal Reserve , he predicts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economy flattens out in the second and third quarters. ' ' // ' ' Surprises for the bond market , ' ' Mr. Benson says , ' ' are likely to be positive . . . . The best bond rally of the year is likely to be on the horizon. ' ' // But technical analysts at most brokerage firms indicate this is still a period of great uncertainty in the stock and bond markets . The federal budget deficit , the trade deficit , and the future of interest rates and of corporate profits are all sources of concern and could cause the market to drop - or at least keep it from rising significantly . But that involves the abstract concept of ' ' the market ' ' more than it does individual stocks. // Bucking the trend in this kind of market , a number of advisers say , are stocks of companies that are the targets of mergers or acquisitions ( M &; A ) . Gulf Oil has been a good recent example. ( details , Page B14 ) . Brokers often call these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a discount to the market value of their assets . Oilman and financier T. Boone Pickens Jr. of Amarillo , Texas , saw Gulf as such an asset play and took a run at it . Individual investors can do the same thing , albeit on a smaller scale. // Philip Erlanger of the Advest brokerage firm in Hartford , Conn. , looks not only for M &; A targets but also looks directly for the targeters - especially the smaller ones . He admires Pickens ' s Mesa Petroleum for aggressively seeking to benefit its stockholders , either by buying shares of big oil companies or by selling those shares at a profit. // But with stocks , in particular , remember that your principal is at risk . If you invest in fixed-interest vehicles - bonds , money market accounts , simple savings - your principal is protected , and you receive a set return . Sometimes that return is small , even negligible , but you ' ll get back at least what you put in . With stocks , you receive a total return : price appreciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be interrupted and the price of the stock can drop below - well below - what you paid for it. // If you want to take a small amount of risk , says Thom R. Brown of the Philadelphia-based Butcher &; Singer securities firm , a good long-term purchase today might be stock in some of the regional phone companies created this year by the breakup of AT &; T. Mr. Brown says these companies are fundamentally undervalued in the marketplace , selling below what other independent phone companies sell for. // ' ' With the regional phone companies , ' ' Brown says , ' ' I think you ' d be able to see capital appreciation , and you ' d be paid to wait by the dividends. ' ' // An investor seeking a surer spot for his or her money might consider municipal bonds . In many cases these offer yields of up to 10 percent and no taxes. // Analysts say an investor who already has a working portfolio of stocks , bonds , or both might consider taking advantage of today ' s market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are stocks that are good on a fundamental basis - that is , those with sound finances and management and a long history of increasing dividends. // Eric Miller of the Donaldson , Lufkin &; Jenrette brokerage agrees that good-quality stocks can be good buys when the market is weak . If , however , some of your money is in a money market fund , Mr. Miller does not advise diverting it to common stocks . He is especially concerned that individual investors might not have the time or the information to track stocks in volatile sectors such as high-tech. // ' ' If you ' ve got stocks , continue to hold them , ' ' says James Balog of the Drexel Burnham Lambert brokerage . ' ' What happened ( the slide in the first six weeks of 1984 ) has been an aberration . If you buy , you ' ll want the big names . These give you high liquidity. ' ' // What to do in today ' s hot and cold investment climate ? The short answer seems to be : Minimize your risks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so does the stock market . A prudent investment for spring or summer , this year or next , might be made today. // //
