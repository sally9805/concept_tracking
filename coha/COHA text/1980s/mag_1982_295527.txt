New TV technology opens a world in which touching is believing <P> The child 's hand reaches out tentatively . Years of haranguing ( " Keep your greasy fingers off the TV ! " ) have made the screen taboo . But when the child sees that his finger causes the image to change , learns that his touch magically provokes new pictures , sequences , words and diagrams , his hand begins to jab , rub and slap the screen . Curiosity , once aroused , is satisfied by simply touching a picture of what one wants to understand . This process is re-enacted thousands of times every day at the U.S. Pavilion at Energy Expo ' 82 ( a.k.a. the Knoxville , Tenn. , World 's Fair ) as exuberant children and their more inhibited parents discover that TV viewing is passive no longer . The technology is called the interactive videodisc : the symbiosis of the computer and the laser-vision disc . <P> Clustered inside the wedge-shaped steel-and-glass pavilion are 42 TV screens connected to 42 Sony videodisc machines , which are hooked up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground floor explain the meaning of 480 energy-related terms . Do n't know what a Pelton wheel is ? Press the word on the screen , and presto ! , a swirling water turbine appears . A different set of screens shows a colorful cutaway drawing of a house . Wondering how to make your home energy-efficient ? Just touch the attic , for example , and watch a demonstration of how to insulate it . According to Emmett Cunningham of the U.S. Department of Commerce , the genial director of the exhibit , " It 's the best and most durable public information system I 've seen in 25 years in the exposition business . " <P> The system , says its unflappable designer , Tom Nicholson of the New York City exhibition firm of Ramirez and Woods , " personalizes " information . Determined to avoid an intimidating computer keyboard , he employed a " user-friendly , " touch-sensitive screen . Pressure on the screen tells the computer to retrieve the information stored on the videodisc corresponding to the word or symbol touched . Although the computer makes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the versatility of the videodisc . And you thought the disc was the Edsel of video technology . <P> Alas , the poor videodisc , so misunderstood , so maligned . Most people think it a single-purpose instrument , a movie machine . The misconception was fostered by the much ballyhooed introduction in 1981 of RCA 's Selecta Vision , 15 years and $200 million in the making . Not a truly innovative technology , Selecta Vision is essentially a phonograph that uses a mechanical stylus to play prerecorded movies . Its costly debut obscured the second type of videodisc : the infinitely more versatile laser-vision disc , designed for the videodisc player introduced by Magnavox in 1978 . Manufactured by Pioneer , Sony and the 3M Co. , the laser-vision disc makes flexible interaction possible .
