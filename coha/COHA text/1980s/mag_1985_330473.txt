The phone calls from the U.S. embassy in Moscow last Wednesday struck a note of ominous mystery . Business people , journalists and students in the Soviet capital were " urged to attend " a 9:30 p.m. briefing at Spaso House , the residence of the American Ambassador . They would be asked to sign a list of those attending ; no cameras or recording devices would be allowed . Subject : secret until the briefing . <P> But by the time the Americans assembled , the message read to them by Charge d'Affaires Richard Combs had already been trumpeted to the world by the State Department . The U.S. proclaimed that it had caught the Soviet KGB using a kind of spy dust : an invisible chemical agent " applied indirectly to embassy personnel " and possibly to other Americans in the U.S.S.R. , presumably by spreading it on objects such as doorknobs and auto steering wheels that the Americans would be sure to touch . The Americans would then leave traces of it on anything or anyone they touched . Thus the KGB might , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Americans by finding the chemical tracer in the dissident 's apartment . <P> The chemical , NPPD ( for nitro-phenylpentadien ) is " potentially harmful " as well , the U.S. contended . Tests show that it is a mutagen , meaning it is capable of altering a cell 's genetic makeup ; mutagens can be , but are not always , cancer-causing agents . The U.S. conceded it has " no evidence to date " of any serious ill effects . All the same , said State Department Spokesman Charles Redman in Washington , " we have protested the practice in the strongest terms and demanded that it be terminated immediately . " <P> That was one of a series of public challenges delivered to the Kremlin by the Reagan Administration last week . National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane fired the first salvo on Monday by warning , in a speech to the Channel City Women 's Forum in Santa Barbara , Calif. , that the Soviets must change their basic thinking on security issues and human rights if they are to have much hope of reaching even " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced over strenuous Soviet objections that it would go ahead , possibly by the end of next week , with an often postponed test of an advanced antisatellite weapon ( see box ) . <P> At week 's end the President joined the offensive . In a Los Angeles speech interrupting his California vacation , Reagan once more defended his Star Wars program to develop a defense against enemy missiles . In the process , he took a poke at the Soviet bear . Noting that domestic critics had called Star Wars " unfeasible , " Reagan asked , " Well , if that 's true , why are the Soviets so upset about it ? As a matter of fact , why are they investing so many rubles of their own in the same technologies ? " <P> Taken together , the words and actions suggest that the U.S. is preparing for the Nov. 19-20 summit meeting in Geneva between Reagan and Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev in a spirit of confrontation . The Soviets are posing as conciliators , but at the same time have launched a wide-ranging propaganda offensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a temporary suspension of underground nuclear tests that is attractive to the Europeans but deceptive in the Americans ' view , combined with loud charges that the U.S. is accelerating preparations to conduct chemical warfare .
