With so many contenders for the title of Most Overrated Young American Artist , it is hard to award the palm . But one of the strongest candidates would certainly be David Salle , who at 34 is having what is called a " mid- career retrospective " of 42 enormous paintings at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City . After closing at the Whitney on March 29 , the exhibition will travel through next January to museums in Los Angeles , Toronto and Chicago . As a sign of cultural inflation , it would be hard to beat . <P> This premature event looks like a real retrospective but is not one . It covers the past seven years of Salle 's work and is  --  to pinch a term from Jean Baudrillard , the French semiotician whose phrases are parroted everywhere in the art world today and recur like pious ejaculations in the exhibition catalog  --  a " simulacrum . " In days of yore , the aim of a museum retrospective used to be clear . It was to sum up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life 's work . For a major museum to give a 34-year-old artist a retrospective would have seemed absurd , like tossing an egg into the air to admire its grace of flight . Not anymore . The pressures of market hype , acting on curators who do not wish to seem stuffy , have made pseudo events like this common  --  even if the brevity of the artist 's career fills his curriculum vitae with solemn entries like " 1960 : Receives from a family friend The Natural Way to Draw , an artist 's handbook . " <P> Salle , who was eight that year , seems not quite to have absorbed whatever lessons the text offered . Instead , he was destined to become the painter most identified with the big vogue of the early ' 80s , " appropriation " : the copying and scavenging of images and stylistic packages , or even of whole works , from other art and the mass media . Works like Footmen , 1986 , are palimpsests : some grainy silkscreens a la Warhol , a head roughly quoted from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad bridge , a scrawled yellow outline of a girl in hot pants . They suggest narrative but deliver none . <P> Not even Salle 's most devout fans seem able to say what his pictures are about , for all their literary overtones . They are laden with sexual imagery )  --  Salle 's work seems to owe a lot to a brief stint he did as a layout man for the porn magazine Stag in the mid- ' 70s  --  but that imagery comes out as congealed , monotonous sleaze . Salle 's nudes are mere signs for bimbos , not erotic presences , and their popularity may be linked to the cynicism of their sexual politics . <P> In general , Salle 's work is just a sourer , more hermetic and manually coarser footnote to a long modernist history of montage and quotation that runs from Dada to Pop art  --  random citation from the image haze that envelops us , with some T. and A. for signature . Its " relevance " consists only of the accuracy with which it mirrors the inattentiveness of a culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosenquist , for the big , juxtaposed image fragments , and to Francis Picabia , for the unassimilated layering of outline images over solid ones in that painter 's late , wretchedly bad paintings . But where appropriation is concerned , it is not etiquette to speak of debt .
