I had not been to bed since early Sunday , and I was discouraged and almost exhausted . Many agonizing hours without sleep had removed any bright visions of the future or vivid memories of the past . I could think only of the current challenge . <P> It was my last day in office , and in many ways these were the most dramatic moments of my presidency . America 's diplomatic , military and economic forces were marshaled , ready to respond to my command . It was a challenging and at times tormenting experience . I needed to be constantly alert , but there were periods when I realized I was not at my best . I was searching for new ideas , trying to understand more clearly one of the most intricate financial and political problems ever faced by any nation . At stake were the lives of 52 human beings imprisoned in Iran for 444 days , and almost $12 billion of Iranian assets . <P> Sometimes I was alone in the Oval Office , but most often Hamilton Jordan and Jody Powell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeatedly urging me to get some rest . I spent most of the time at my desk , but when the action was slow , lay down on one of the small couches before the fireplace , often with the telephones on the floor beside me . I was talking to a number of people at different places in the world , and I took meticulous notes so that I would not become confused or forget what they said . I watched the big grandfather clock by the door . Time was an ever present concern . <P> I knew that the reputation and influence of our country were hanging in the balance , and I can not deny that I was eager to resolve this crisis while I was still President in order to justify the decisions I had made . I had a major responsibility and not much time left to carry it out . At noon , I would no longer be President . <P> The holding of the American hostages had cast a pall over my own life and over the American people since Nov. 4 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also had deep private feelings . The hostages sometimes seemed like part of my own family . I knew them by name , was familiar with their careers , had read their letters written from their prisons in Iran . More than anything else , I wanted those prisoners to be free . <P> Four days earlier my final effort for their freedom had begun , keeping us occupied throughout the weekend . On Friday , Jan. 16,1981 , we had worked out with Iran the general terms for the release of the hostages . Since then , we had been afflicted by constant delays . <P> Throughout this grim experience , it had been almost impossible to negotiate with the suspicious and irrational men who refused to communicate directly with me or any other American . We all knew that the Iranians with whom we were working were under heavy attack from more militant officials , who vehemently opposed any plans to release the hostages . <P> An Algerian team under Foreign Minister Mohammed Benyahia were acting as intermediaries . The Iranians , who spoke Persian , would talk only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or proposal of mine had to be translated twice as it went from Washington to Algiers to Tehran ; the answers and counterproposals had to come back over the same slow route .
