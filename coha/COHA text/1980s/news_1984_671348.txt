They are the low-end discount retailers - Robbins , Modell ' s , Mays and the department store bargain basements are the prime examples in New York City . But despite their problems , they seem to be doing well , with 10 to 12 percent sales increases last year and the same projected in 1984. // With Abraham &; Straus planning to close its five budget-basement operations to make more room for higher- priced merchandise , the remaining low-price merchants will be scrambling for a bigger slice of the pie . To draw the business - and also attract a higher-income clientele - they are introducing more brand names , cleaning up their stores and stressing value . In the process , they hope to overcome what they acknowledge is a persistent image problem. // " People think I am running a bargain bazaar because my prices are low and my stores are plain , " observed Melvin Robbins , the head of the 17-store Robbins Men ' s and Boys ' Wear chain . And certainly , the Robbins stores , with their pipe racks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prominent security guards , have had a distinctive , low-rent atmosphere. // <> <> ' We Are Darned Serious ' // " In reality , my prices are as low or lower than the budget departments of the department stores , " Mr. Robbins said . But " we have more continuity and depth because we don ' t sell just items but lines . And it ' s our only business , so we are darned serious about it. " // Still , Mr. Robbins said , the public ' s " superficial " perception of his business and its desire for merchandise sold in stylish surroundings and carried home in fancy shopping bags may well be preventing the sort of sales growth he would like . And this is complicated by shopping-center developers who , he added , " do not hold out a welcoming hand because we are discounters and we are not beautiful. " // Suppliers , too , sometimes show the same reluctance to do business with Robbins stores . Yet , all three - customers , developers and suppliers - are increasingly , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but it isn ' t easy. " // " Department stores are still outpacing the gains reported by most mass merchandisers and discounters , reflecting the better financial position of their customers , " said Jeffrey B. Edelman , retailing analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds . But , he added , " It should be noted , too , that the lower end appears to be coming back strongly. " // <> <> $350 Million Market // And the low-price market in the New York area is a big one , with estimated annual sales of more than $350 million , about half of it transacted by the five majors - the basements of A. &; S. and Gimbels , as well as J. W. Mays , Robbins and Modell ' s. // Estimates are that current sales at Mays are $90 million ; Robbins , $40 million ; A. &; S. budget , $30 million , and Gimbels budget , about $15 million . No estimates are available for Modell ' s. // In any case , stores and chains that cater to lower-income customers , those that concentrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , are in a state of flux . And the changes look good for the stores . One reason is that , because of the planned A. &; S. closings , fewer stores may soon be able to divide a market that seems to be growing . Another is that the trend toward better merchandise also means better profits. // Oddly enough , low-price retailing markups , which always lagged somewhat behind the upstairs departments , passed them last year , averaging 48. 7 percent against 48. 4 percent for upstairs goods . But , of course , that is only the percentage markup ; upstairs departments , with their higher price tags , also have much greater volume and more profit dollars. // Which is one reason why A. &; S. , one of the area ' s largest department store chains , is closing its budget operations during the next year . The chain said its stores needed more space for their upstairs merchandise. // In effect , acknowledged Curt Champlin , A. &; S. general manager of budget stores and head of the Brooklyn store , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume of its goods at higher than budget prices. // <> <> Big Volume Up for Grabs // Trade sources estimated that the discontinuance of the A. &; S. basement businesses would mean that some $25 million to $35 million in low-price volume would be up for grabs . And the analysts said that since none of the remaining competitors , including the Gimbels basements , had an identity distinct from the others , any or all could capture that volume. // But that identity problem may be changing , too . While they are not abandoning their low-priced businesses , both Mays and Robbins are trying to trade up. // For years , Mays has operated boutiques in its stores aimed at shoppers who do not mind paying for more fashionable women ' s apparel. // " Our sales are improving in recent months , particularly in better merchandise , which we are increasingly buying in Europe , Sri Lanka , India and Thailand , " said Max L. Shulman , the chairman of Mays . " We are going after the better-income customer with clothes and home decorative items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In February , Mays emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings after closing five of its nine stores . In both 1980 and 1981 , Mays had been severely hurt by what Mr. Shulman called the " twin obstacles of recession and high interest rates . " In November 1982 , it filed for court protection under the Bankruptcy Code. // <> <> A Matter of Appearance // The Robbins chain is trying to attract somewhat better-heeled customers by improving the appearance of its stores . " Price is still the main attraction for everyone , " Mr. Robbins said , " even though everyone wants to buy well-known brands at a glamorous store. " // " But being beautiful has a price and the hordes of average customers can ' t afford it , " he said . " That ' s where we come in. " // Tall and intense , the 56-year-old Mr. Robbins is a graduate of the Yale Law School who gave up his legal practice 20 years ago to operate a low-priced retail business founded by his late father , Harry. // In the fiscal year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11. 5 percent , to $36. 8 million , from $33 million the year before , while net income rose 9. 2 percent , to $721 , 916 , from $660 , 838. // Mr. Robbins said he was encouraged because people who were obviously not low-income customers were coming into his stores for specific merchandise . " We are trying to meet that demand by upgrading our image , " he said , " putting in better fixtures and generally trying to have a cleaner look and get rid of the ' dump ' of merchandise. " // " We earn between 2 to 3 percent after taxes - not bad for our type of store , " he said , " and could open another 10 stores if we could find the right sites and more centers would let us in.
