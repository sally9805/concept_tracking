DETROIT  --  The Big Three auto makers are sticking with aggressive first-quarter production , indicating they are resigned to offering costly sales incentives through much of the first half of this year . Repeated rounds of incentives offer the best chance to keep sales strong through the first half , industry officials and analysts say . That poses a particular problem for General Motors Corp. , which is saddled with higher costs than its Big Three rivals because of its heavy spending for future products and plants . Some auto executives fear that continued successive incentive programs could lose their ability to stimulate demand . That would make production cuts , which already have occurred on a small scale , the alternative . For now , the Big Three ' s first-quarter production plans look more sustainable now than they did a month ago , thanks to a late December sales surge caused by low-interest financing incentives . The higher sales rate , along with holiday plant closings , slowed the worrisome rise in the supply of unsold cars at GM and Chrysler Corp . Inventories at Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production start-up for its new Taurus and Sable midsize cars . " Several weeks ago it looked like sales were headed for a collapse , but the new sales inducements on 1986 models make things look reasonably good , " said William F. Prebe , vice president and economist at Dana Corp. , a major auto-parts supplier . Sales will " go in fits and spurts through at least the first half of 1986 , " he said , depending on the status of incentive programs . Domestic auto makers plan to build about 2. 2 million cars in the January-March quarter , sources say . The production plans haven ' t changed much since last fall , though since then GM has made some modest cuts and American Motors Corp. has made more significant cuts . If auto makers build the 2. 2 million cars they plan , production will be almost the same as in the year-earlier quarter , when GM was building all-out in the wake of a strike . GM itself plans to build only about 29 , 000 fewer cars this quarter than it built a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 1 auto maker . It had more than one million cars in inventory at year ' s end , around an 82-day supply at current selling rates . A year earlier , it had only 643 , 000 cars , or a 51-day supply . A 60-day to 65-day supply is considered normal . But GM ' s strategy is to boost its sagging market share by having plenty of cars on hand this spring , when it hopes Japanese cars will be in short supply because of import restraints that extend until March 31 . GM also hopes that Ford will have shortages of cars ; Ford has only around a 50-day supply now , and the incentives begun last month may reduce that further . But Ford ' s current low stocks aren ' t " that much of a burden , " said Louis R. Lataif , Ford ' s top North American sales executive . He added : " It ' s a little silly for a competitor to say , ' If we have the most cars , we ' ll sell the most . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars will sell best . " Consumers have come to expect rebates , low-interest financing or other incentives , auto executives and analysts say , and delay purchases until incentives appear . Indeed , domestic-car sales have been consistently weak since summer except during periods of incentives . The prospect of on-and-off incentives for months to come is likely to prove more costly to GM than to its Big Three rivals . The company ' s costs and expenses rose about 23% in the third quarter from the year before , while Ford ' s showed a slight year-to-year decline . Combined with sweeping sales incentives , GM ' s costs caused it to post a third-period operating loss . Ford and Chrysler had operating profits despite offering similar incentives . The current round of incentives probably won ' t hurt GM ' s profit as much as the September incentives did , however , because the difference between prevailing interest rates and the incentive-financing rate GM is offering is narrower than it was in September . The current incentives also apply to fewer cars . Here is what sources say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1986 1985 %Chg .
