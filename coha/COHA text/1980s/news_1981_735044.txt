txt OR ALMOST 30 years , Barry Gifford has been a Cub fan . And , for most of his adult life , he has been a writer . Last year , Gifford , 34 , put the two together . He wrote a nostalgic personal history called " The Neighborhood of Baseball , " about his formative years in and around Wrigley Field and his complete devotion to the Cubs and to major league baseball . Scone people think being a Cub fan is a jinx in itself . As Gifford notes , a look at the final standings for the last 25 years proves that point . But the jinx makers outdid themselves when it came to testing Gifford this time : His book , published by Dutton , came out May 28 and off Gifford went on a national book tour to talk about the Cubs . It was as If Barry Gifford had turned into Joe Btlfsk , Al Capp 's immortal cartoon character whose constant traveling companion was a cloud of bad luck . What happened to Gifford Is the kind of thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came June 12 , when major league baseball players went on strike , immediately putting his book 's sale on hold . Newspapers , magazines , radio , and television , to whom he 'd already given interviews , spiked the story for the duration of the strike . What was the point of interviews about the nostalgia of baseball when there was no baseball to be nostalgic about ? Book sales froze . Three days after the strike began , the Cubs were purchased'by Tribune Co. , which made Gifford 's baseball book dated even before people got a chance to read it . The sale of the Cubs generated new interest in Gifford , though , and his thoughts about the new owners , and he appeared briefly on national television , telling everyone it would be for the best . That was the good news . The bad news was no one bought his book . When the baseball strike finally was over , his book began to sell well , but all was not home runs and low ERAS : air traffic controllers ' strike curtailed // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Cub fan 's jinxed book // Gifford 's revived book tour . And last week , the announcement that veteran broadcaster Jack Brickhouse will leave the Cubs next year " Put the final period , " Gifford says , op  --  the era he talks about so affectionately in his book . GIFFORD , WHO now lives in Berkeley . Cal. , was back in town last week to discuss a documentary film he 's Making on the late author William Saroyan , and  --  to attend a Cubs-White Sox game  --  the one at Wrigley Field , of course , not Comiskey Park . And being the quintessential Cub fan , even from 2,000 Miles away , it turns out he was more worried about not having baseball this season than he was about the sale of ' his book . " I missed going to.games , " the writer says . " I missed listening to baseball on the radio as a background to whatever I was doing . Baseball gives me a secure , grounded feeling . I missed that feeling . " During'the strike , Gifford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to do to survive . He went fishing in the Florida Keys for the duration . " I would have gone crazy if I 'd stayed home , " he says , Gifford looks pretty good , considering what he 's been through . . A serious , intellectual man with riveting blue eyes and a baseball player 's physique , he still goes to bat for the Cubs . " The new ownership will be more progressive , " he says . " It might produce a winner . But I 'll miss the individuality of the Wrigley ownership . It 's one thing to think you can pick up the phone and call Bill Wrigley . You know you ca n't phone and ask to speak with Tribune Co . " BEING A LOYAL Cub fan is a challenge for those living right here at the scene of the crime , but during the last 16 years Gifford has been away from Waveland Avenue and traveled all ? vet the world , he 's managed to hang in there . He surreptitiously watches the scoreboard at Oakland A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , subscribes to his hometown paper , checks Cub statistics in sports magazines , and constantly asks visitors from Chicago how his favorite team i " When I was 5 , I got hooked on baseball , " he says . " My.father owned the Lake Shore drug store at Chicago and Rush . Jle sold . liquor at the store and for my first game we sat in'box seats Schenley Liquor had for its customers . After that 1 moved to the bleachers , and between 1952 and 1964 , I saw 50 Cub games a year . And the Cubs only finished as high as fifth three times . " " My father died when I was 12 , " says Gifford . " My mother was married four times . My home was unpredictable . Baseball became my home base . It was a way to remain sane when I felt like an outcast . " LIE AND HIS buddies hung around Bebop 's pool hall , played . ball at Green Briar Park and for Clinton Elementary School , read all the Chip Hilton books and sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank orange ' and grape Neill , and for hours on mid played All-Star ; Baseball , a Cadaco-Ellis board game . When he was 10 , Gifford , a promising third baseman and pitcher , was scouted by the St. Louis Cardinals , but he wanted , 2 to be a writer . " Your baseball career ' lasts as long as your hamstrings , " tie says . He played baseball at the University of Missouri but dropped out after a few months , " I was tired of competitiveness . I wanted to get away from sports . I needed a few years to cool out , " ' Gifford became a merchant seaman , went to King 's College of , Cambridge University in England , and won a poetry prize in London when he was ** was a musician in Europe and then came back to the U.S. , settled in California , where he lives with his wife , who is a weaver , and two children .
