When the seven state leaders arrive in Toronto Sunday , there will be no review of the honor guard . Instead , the heads of state from West Germany , France , Italy , Japan , Britain , Canada , and the United States will go straight to the Toronto Conference Center for two hours of discussion on economic priorities and the world economy. // ' ' I think there will be real action on economic issues , ' ' says US Treasury Secretary James Baker III . Since none of the nations are facing a recession , this summit is likely to be upbeat . Even the West Germans will be somewhat immune from criticism , since their economy is showing stronger than expected growth. // // The Toronto meeting will also be Ronald Reagan ' s last economic summit . ( Reagan ' s foreign policy agenda , Page 3 . ) Officials say Mr. Reagan will give his ' ' valedictory ' ' talk on the accomplishments of the summits from his perspective and the areas of future concern. // US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main issues to be discussed include East-West relations , drugs , relief supplies for Afghan guerrillas , structural economic adjustments , farm subsidies , and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) negotiations . The most likely area of agreement will be on aiding the ' ' poorest of the poor ' ' debtor countries , Secretary Baker says. // As in past meetings , political issues will be discussed at the formal dinners . On the topic of East-West relations , the President is likely to discuss the Soviets ' interest in seeing the Jackson-Vanik amendment removed . This congressional act denies communist countries most-favored-nation status unless they permit free emigration. // Reagan is also expected to raise the issue of getting medical and humanitarian supplies to Afghan resistance forces. // The drug issue is also an expected topic . ' ' The Europeans are more aware of this , since cocaine prices have been cut and drugs are being transshipped to Europe , ' ' one White House aide says . The final communique is expected to include a segment on combating the drug problem. // Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The ultimate capacity of a country to deal with a changing world depends on the quality of its people , ' ' a Canadian official says. // Economic issues on the agenda include : // Structural economic changes . The US will press for the Europeans , especially the West Germans to make structural changes in their economy to accelerate growth . For example , German stores usually close at 6 p. m. every day . Lengthening store hours , which is favored by German consumers , would add tens of thousands of new jobs. // The US would also like to see the European telecommunications industry opened up to competition , which would be of benefit to US and Japanese firms . As in past summits , the Japanese will hear complaints about barriers to foreign goods , including their complex goods distribution system. // Farm subsidies . The sharpest differences will be over agriculture . The European leaders are unhappy with the US , which is pressuring the European Community to join it in ending costly subsidies to farmers . The Europeans , however , are incensed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of acreage farmers can plant . ' ' We are receiving the wrong signal from the other side of the Atlantic , ' ' complains Willy de Clercq , the European commissioner for external relations and trade. // Pushing GATT negotiations . The leaders are expected to press for a strong endorsement of the current round of GATT talks . ' ' They will want to give it a real shove to see it doesn ' t dwindle away , ' ' a senior Canadian official says. // This December , GATT participants will meet in Montreal for the ' ' midterm review . ' ' The US wants the participants to chart a fast-paced course , rewriting the trade rules over the next two years . Starting next Wednesday , the trade ministers will meet in Brainard , Minn. , to discuss differences on the GATT issues. // Included in the GATT negotiations are plans to eliminate many of the farm subsidies . The US spends about $26 billion on farm subsidies support , while the EC spends about $36 billion . ' ' In no field do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Reagan said Monday. // Debt forgiveness . The French will propose forgiving a third of the debt owed to Western governments by the ' ' poorest of the poor ' ' countries , especially those in sub-Saharan Africa . ' ' The situation is unbearable , ' ' says Mr. de Clercq. // While the US says it can not agree to forgive official debts , administration officials say the US will not stand in the way of other countries granting debt relief. // Instead , the US will propose lengthening the time the nations have to repay the debt . ' ' We can not give away taxpayers ' funds like that , ' ' says a US official , who adds that the US would prefer to tie debt concessions to policy reform among the debtor nations. // This debt question may be an area of concrete accomplishment . The summitteers will probably agree on a ' ' menu approach . ' ' Each nation would be free to choose any of several formulas to ease the debt burden . Alternatives include debt forgiveness , lower interest rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other summits , the question of stabilizing the dollar will not be a major issue , since the US currency , with central bank help , has remained in a narrow trading range . Participants are also likely to try and ignore the US budget deficit , mindful that it is an election year in the US. // But the seven leaders may endorse a system of commodity indicators to be used in looking at one another ' s economies . The goal of this mutual ' ' surveillance ' ' is to improve economic cooperation and encourage appropriate changes in national economic policies. // Secretary Baker has suggested the addition of commodity prices , including gold , to other national economic indicators . Such an indicator might be useful in determining inflation . <> <> Toronto economic summit <> <> Who : Leaders of the world ' s seven major industrial nations ( known as the Group of Seven , or G-7 ) will meet at the Toronto Convention Center , Sunday through Tuesday. // Britain : Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher // Canada : Prime Minister Brian Mulroney // France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Mita // Japan : Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita // United States : President Ronald Reagan // West Germany : Chancellor Helmut Kohl // What : National leaders , accompanied by senior Cabinet officials , will have three days of meetings , receptions , and formal dinners . They will discuss both political issues ( East-West relations , drugs , relief supplies for Afghan rebels ) and economic topics ( structural economic adjustments in West Germany , farm subsidies , GATT talks on trade ) . // Previous summits : Annual economic summits have been held since 1975 , with their sites rotating among the seven countries represented . Recent summits have produced agreements on coordinating economic policy , including foreign- exchange rates . In 1984 , the members committed themselves to reversing the trend toward protectionism and implementing solutions for international debt. // Last year in Venice , the leaders reaffirmed commitment to stable exchange rates , called for lower interest rates , and criticized the US budget deficit . Political talk concerned cooperation on the Gulf and arms control. // //         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
