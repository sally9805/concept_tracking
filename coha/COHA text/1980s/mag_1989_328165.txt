" We 're really living with a false sense of security , " warns George Mitchell , an independent Houston oilman . " We 're heading for deep trouble . " What provokes Mitchell 's dire prediction is the shriveled condition of the U.S. oil-drilling industry , which he believes has made the country seriously vulnerable to a future energy emergency . " We 're losing ground faster than we might have predicted even a few months ago , " he says . Adds John Watson , another Houston oilman : " All the people have left , rigs have been dismantled , the financial industry has turned its back on oil and gas . It would take an all-out crusade to come back . " <P> Not everyone is quite so gloomy , but the current brisk run-up in oil prices serves as a reminder that the U.S. energy supply is increasingly under the influence of outside forces . During March commodities traders bid the price of oil above the $20-a-bbl. threshold for the first time in 17 months . Last week the futures price of West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bbl. , up some 50% since last October . The rally largely reflects an unexpectedly successful campaign by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries , along with several non-OPEC countries , to curb their output and reduce the world 's oversupply . Since early January , OPEC production has fallen about 3.5 million bbl. a day , to some 19 million . <P> While the price of petroleum is still a long way from its $35-a-bbl. peak in 1981 , the U.S. is sliding back to a level of dependence on foreign sources not seen since the oil-shock days of the 1970s . January petroleum imports averaged 8.1 million bbl. a day , up almost 21% from a year ago and surpassing domestic production ( 8 million bbl. ) for the first time in more than a decade . The import surge has hampered efforts to shrink the U.S. trade deficit , and rising prices have aggravated inflationary pressure . <P> As if the 1970s were only a bad dream , consumers have been content to step on the gas . Sales of light trucks and four-wheel-drive vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set U.S. sales records for four of the past five years . Small wonder : the price of gasoline , adjusted for inflation , is at its 1965 level . Among customers choosing a recreational vehicle , says Bill Jocoy , a salesman at Northwoods RV Supermarket in Lansing , Mich. , mileage per gallon ranks only fifth or sixth among their priorities , after color and floor plan . <P> The long stretch of low oil prices during the 1980s has discouraged U.S. exploration and consumption . Only 740 drilling rigs were operating in the U.S. / last week , down from 943 a year ago and a far cry from the 4,500 functioning rigs in late 1981 . Exxon 's spending on domestic drilling dropped nearly two- thirds from 1985 to 1987 , to $333 million . Oil experts estimate that prices will have to stabilize at no less than $25 a bbl. to encourage a drilling resurgence in the U.S. Many American oil companies have boosted their exploration overseas , where finding oil typically costs $1.50 to $2 less per bbl. than in the U.S.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
