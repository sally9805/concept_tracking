THE SRTURDAT EVENING POST October ' 84 Dan Peters often said that he would rather meet President Dan Willard , of the B. &; 0. , than Napoleon . He said when President Dan pounded his big desk in Baltimore , the windows in his office would puff out like the cheeks of balloons , and the B. &; 0 . tracks would shake 15 miles away . What Dan Willard said of Dan Peters does n't appear in the official history of the railroad , but it is common knowledge among railroad men that the first time Dan Peters ' name was discussed in Baltimore , President Dan shook the National Limited off the tracks near Washington , and as far west as Cumberland , Maryland , section hands dozing beside the tracks jumped up respectfully and tipped their caps . That was the day when Dan Willard and his officers , sitting openmouthed like a glee club around the big desk , heard that the B. &; 0 . had somehow mislaid a train . Dan Willard 's eloquence , when the situation demanded it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes more ominous than the rain before a typhoon . Dan Willard was silent . And when he finally spoke , it was only to gasp , " Who in Tophet -- What engineer has managed to do that ? " It took a long-distance call to answer this question . When the answer came , it was in one of those moments like Daniel Boone looking through Cumberland Gap into Kentucky : it was the first time that the most famous name in railroad history since Stephenson , save only Dan Willard 's name , had been mentioned in the big office in Baltimore . The traffic manager looked up from the telephone and said , " The engineer is Dan Peters . " They combed the record as though it was a Shetland pony , trying to find what they could about Dan Peters . His history was neat and favorable . Twenty years an engineer on the Muskingum Valley spur line in Ohio . Twenty years a well-kept timetable . " If you saw a roomful of quiet little men , " the personnel manager said , " Dan Peters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little man , the records agreed , meek and gentle , completely dependable , but no imagination . Then they kept the wires warm to the west , and the more they asked , the more items people remembered about Dan Peters . For one thing , he talked to his locomotive . When he came down in the morning to his little train that had lain all night like a sleeping cocker spaniel in the yards at Parkersburg , West Virginia , where the long greyhounds of the main line could sniff at it before they dashed on to St. Louis or Washington  --  when he came down he would put his hand gently on the rods and say something to the locomotive ; and it would pant out cones of white smoke and tremble as though it were a streamliner eager to be off for San Francisco , rather than a milk train bound for Marietta , Ohio . So people said . He called the engine " Casey Jones " ? " Casey " for short . " Come on , Casey , " brakemen would sometimes hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em get you down . We are n't very big , but we 're good . Good old Casey ! " he would say , sadly . Then , at 5:40 , he would clang carefully out of the station . By 6:15 , when the sun climbed the hills , spangled the river and danced on the milk cans beside the tracks , he was in Marietta , 13 miles on his way . At 6:20 he tipped his cap forward off his short gray hair to Mrs. I3lennerhassett , who lived beside the railroad , and pointed Casey north under the Harmer bluffs . At 10:00 , or a little later if there had been many milk cans , he was calming his puffy little train to a stop where the shadow of the Zanesville courthouse pointed the finger of its tower across the tracks . Then , at 1:00 , back over the 85 miles to Parkersburg . By 5:30 he would be sliding across the bridge , out of the coolness of the Ohio hills into the late-afternoon sunshine , ease into the Parkersburg station and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last forward impetus would die just before the brakes had to kill it . This , faithfully , for 20 years . A calm man who said little and kept his timetables , everyone agreed . Not until Dan Peters had committed the engineer 's unpardonable sin and broken out of the timetable did people realize how many of his little sayings had stuck like cockleburs in their memories . " Would you rather own a zebra or a giraffe ? " he had asked a brakeman one day . Another time he said , " You know , I was looking at a map last night and found a town named What Cheer , Iowa . Now what do you suppose What Cheer , Iowa , is like ? " And one day just before starting time , the station agent overheard this conversation . " Bill , " Dan Peters asked Big Bill , his fireman , " do you suppose a locomotive ever gets jealous of automobiles ? " " Uh , " remarked the fireman . " As far as we know , " said Dan , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one side . " " Want to bet on it ? " asked the fireman . " And no offense to your home town , " said Dan , " but sometimes I get so damned tired riding into Marietta , Ohio . " " Marietta , Ohio , is one of the most interesting small towns in the United States of America , " said Big Bill . " It has the biggest elm tree in the country . " " That 's what I mean , " said Dan . " If Marietta only had the smallest elm tree once . " The fireman rolled his eyes . " Every day for 20 years , " said Dan , " I 've picked up three milk cans at Ben Eppel 's farm . Never two or four . For 20 years . " " How much time we got ? " THE SRTURDEY EVENING POST that was running along and nobody could find the engineer , and nobody knew where it was going . They finally found they were going to heaven , and this was the westbound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it was a ship , not a train . " Then President Dan Willard rose and delivered one of those pithy remarks for which he is famous wherever railroad men come to warm their feet around an iron stove . " Gentlemen , " he said , " you can lose a crowbar . You can lose a brakeman . You can even lose an elephant . Gentlemen " ? his fist fell ? " gentlemen , you ca n't lose a train ! " But his voice lacked conviction . Alone in the big office , Dan Willard set about quilting together the story of what had happened that day in the Muskingum Valley . It was a long time before he could make the pieces fit . No. 41 was puffing into a curve . The brakeman later said they might have been going a little fast . Certainly they were going faster than cautious Dan Peters usually went . There was a jolt  --  a slight jolt , more than a loose rail , less than a cow  --  and the hills , which had been on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides . A picket fence was sliding past the windows like a fine-toothed comb . The brakeman , in his sworn testimony before the Interstate Commerce Commission , said that he had rubbed his eyes and leaned out the door , and  --  he hoped the gentlemen of the commission would believe him when he said that he was not drunk  --  he observed that they were running along the concrete highway . He went back to talk to the conductor . There were no passengers . The conductor was sitting in the coach , rubbing his hand over his eyes and forehead . " Was that an automobile we just went around ? " he asked sleepily . " It was , " said the brakeman . " Hold on ! " shouted the conductor and braced himself for the pile-up . But the train leaned around a curve and rumbled comfortably on beside the picket fence . " This is a funny kind of dream , " said the conductor at last . " I have a sensation that we 're running on a concrete road . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brakeman . " If this is n't a dream , " said the conductor , " in 25 years on the railroad I 've never seen anything like it . " " It is n't a dream , " said the brakeman . " But it simply is n't possible , " the conductor argued , " for a train to run on a concrete road . " " Tell that to Dan Peters , " said the brakeman . Then the train pulled up beside the road , and Dan Peters came back to the coach . When President Dan Willard finally had a chance to talk to the conductor , he asked how Dan Peters looked that morning . The conductor said that Dan came back in his sooty overalls . He looked a little hurt and pitiful , if one did n't look at him carefully . His bushy gray eyebrows curved over the fierce wind-burned red of his cheeks , and when he was n't talking his eyes were a cool gray and his face had the downward curves that seem to say , " Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes flamed into the gray of an August storm that sweeps up out of Kentucky and breaks on the Ohio hills . He did n't say much , but what he said was sure and confident , like Pullman wheels clicking over the rail joints at night . " When will we get into Zanesville ? " the conductor said . He thought later that the question sounded rather stupid . " We wo n't , " said Dan Peters . " Where are we going ? " asked the brakeman . " I do n't rightly know , " said Dan . " Except nowhere we 've ever gone before . We 're even going to run at night , because we 've always had to run in the daytime . I 'm sorry for the inconvenience . You can get off here . " That is the story Dan Willard heard when the conductor telephoned the morning after the train disappeared . He was calling from jail . He wanted to explain what had happened . When he and the brakeman had told their story , a constable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice of the peace had fined them a dollar and costs each , which added up to 39 dollars and 20c , and there they were with $3 between them , and would the railroad please do something . President Dan asked a great many questions , then called the constable to the phone and explained sadly that the conductor and the brakeman were bad ones who should be kept in jail and on no condition allowed to talk to anyone . Then he showed the executive vice president a report from Zanesville which said that a sideshow had moved into the station to wait for the next train to Marietta . Siamese twins and missing links were sleeping on the benches , and monkeys were playing in the signal tower . The manager of the sideshow threatened to sue the railroad . " I read a book once --  " began the vice president . " You , " Dan Willard said you seem to have some ideas on this matter . Suppose you go out and find that train . After as many years as you 've worked with trains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it refreshing to deal with one that does n't know where it 's going . Which puts it in exactly the same situation as most of the world at the present moment , " he added . " The worst of it is , " he reminded his officers after the vice president had left , " we do n't dare get out the police and really look for that train , because if we ever admit we 've lost a train , they 'll never quit laughing at us . " President Dan drummed lightly on his desk until the switch enginesdanced in the Baltimore yards . President Dan Willard began to see a pattern in the fantastic news that filled the papers during the next days . From a hospital in Indiana came the strange story of a farm woman under treatment for hysteria . She told doctors that a small gray-haired man with red cheeks had appeared at her door and asked permission to park in her yard that day , inasmuch as he traveled only at night . She charged him 25c . An hour later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train next to the front porch . The hallucination was remarkably vivid . She could even swear that she saw three men , two in overalls , one in a business suit , cooking beans on the engine 's boiler . Then she fainted . The men in overalls , said President Dan to himself , are Dan Peters and the fireman . Who is the man in a business suit ? A coal dealer in Watseka , Illinois , reported ruefully that thieves with a nasty sense of humor had taken 20 tons of coal from his yard in the dead of night and left a check to which they had forged the name of a vice president of the B. &; 0 . Railroad . President Dan looked a long time at that item , then called in the visiting professor from Cornell , who was on his way to address the Baltimore Kiwanis Club . " I 'm going to make you a detective , " the president said . " If you ca n't find the train , find the vice president . " On the outskirts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that  --  his hand upon a Bible ? he had just serviced a train . President Dan observed that the papers were concerning themselves with a psychological phenomenon . All over the Middle West , psychiatrists reported a sort of mass hallucination  --  the sensation of seeing or hearing a train passing in the night , although there were no tracks near by . A tribe of Navaho Indians told tourists that a god had passed their hogans one night , panted hard , ground his teeth and turned the whether to fire him or make him a vice president . " But when the president got a post card from Mammoth Cave , Kentucky , he closed himself in his office , and spectators saw the windows bulging and contracting like a horse 's sides after a long race . The post card was signed by the executive vice president and the consulting professor . " Have found the train , " said the vice president . " Have found the v.p ? " said the professor . Then they joined in a final message . " Having fine time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " President Dan packed his bag . " If I do n't come back in ten days , " he said , " send the police after the train . " ed to look farther . They smelled something . A traffic policeman in Weirton , West Virginia , finally uncovered the hot trail . This copper , sane and sensible , reported to headquarters that about 3 a.m. he had tried to give a ticket to a vehicle passing through the outskirts of town and showing only one headlight . The vehicle was coming toward him . When he signaled it to stop , he was no little startled to find that he had halted a train . There were no tracks ; it was on the highway . Under the circumstances , it seemed rather silly to say , as he usually did , " What do you think you are ? The Twentieth Century Limited ? " The engineer , a lively little gra haired fellow , politely returned t ticket , challenging him to produce law saying that a locomotive mu carry more than one headlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train and given him a long lecture the laws of optics , proving with di . grams and formulas that the train w better lighted than a fleet of 361 automobiles ; the man had long ha and talked like a professor . When t policeman was thoroughly flabbe gasted anyway , he heard the prole sor fellow call the engineer " Dan , and the thought occurred to him th. perhaps he was trying to arrest Da Scratch , Old Nick himself . Th engineer did look red in th glow from the firebox ; like How the newspapers got the story , President Dan never knew . Yet when the story came out , everyone wondered why the newspapers had been so long breaking it . Frank Luther Mott gave a whole chapter to the problem in his American Journalism ( pages 773-778 ) ? how could the fact that four men were missing in such unusual circumstances be kept so long from reporters ? He decided finally it was partly skillful management , partly chance . The railroad had put a new gasoline train on the spur line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill , both bachelors and solitary men , had been transferred elsewhere . The executive vice president was habitually away from his office much of the time . As for the professor , his family and the university and the Baltimore Kiwanis Club had simply decided to leave well enough alone . And thus it is that if you are looking today for contemporary accounts of the famous lost train , you must leaf through the papers of that year until July 29 before you find a story that mentions Dan Peters . It was apparently the conductor 's trial on a charge of insanity that uncovered the story . The jury was ten to two for insanity , but the testimony was such a humorolis angle on the current locomotive hysteria that a few reporters deciddemon from hell in the mids of the red light . So the officer waved th train on and sat down on th curb to recover his self-posses sion . When he had nearly de tided that the incident h been a moment 's madness or nasty dream , he was reminds by the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piec ; of paper on which the passen ger lecturer had been diagram ming optics . The paper w. not asbestos . In fact , it bor. the letterhead of the Baltimor . &; Ohio Railroad . " What , " everyone asked " does Dan Peters look like ? ' For it was discovered tha there was nowhere a picture o him . " And is he a genius or a madman ? And will he give himself up , or run his train over the Grand Canyon or into the Gulf of Mexico ? And what will President Dan Willard do about him ? " " Let us hope , " said most of the little people who do not own railroad stocks , " that he will not be fired or put into jail . " The night after Dan Peters ' story finally became public property , hardly an eye was closed in the United States . Packs of cars wandered like coyotes over the roads . Seats on high buildings or hills were sold at scalpers ' prices , although there was no proof   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
