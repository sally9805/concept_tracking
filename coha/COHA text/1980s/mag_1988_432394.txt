 | The words stung the American public like a sound paddling in the principal 's office : a " rising tide of mediocrity " was engulfing the nation 's schools , " threatening our very future as a Nation and a people . " That alarm , sounded by the National Commission on Excellence in Education in its 1983 report , " A Nation at Risk , " gave strong voice to the frustrations of parents , teachers , students , government officials and business leaders , and set off a wave of reform not seen since the sputnik era . This week education officials will gather at the White House to report how far we have come in five years . The bottom line , says Education Secretary William Bennett , who directed the study himself at the request of Ronald Reagan : " We 're seeing progress . We 're doing better . But we 're not where we should be . . . We are still at risk . " If nothing else , the nation should rate an A for effort . A1150 states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1983 . More than a dozen have completely overhauled their school systems . Roughly 40 states have raised high-school graduation requirements ; in 19 students must pass a test to receive diplomas . Forty-six have mandated competency tests for new teachers ; 23 have created alternate routes to teacher certification . Teacher salaries have increased , on average , more than twice the rate of inflation , to $28,031 this year . Six states are now legally empowered to " take over " educationally deficient schools ( though none has done so to date ) . Such efforts have brought some undeniable progress . A few troubled schools , such as South Carolina 's Orangeburg-Wilkinson High School , have rebounded dramatically ( following story ) . Nationwide , average combined SAT scores have recovered 16 points since 1980 , reversing a 90-point decline from 1963 . That they have remained stalled , at 906 , for the past three years is still an achievement of sorts , considering that more students are taking the test than ever before ( chart , page 59 ) . Other measures tell a more depressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 percent . U.S. students still rank far below those in many other countries ? particularly in math and science achievement ? and books charting the appalling lack of knowledge by American youth have become fixtures on bestseller lists . Alarmingly , some experts conclude that there has been the least progress at the bottom of the educational heap . " I was one of those naive thinkers who thought the Nation at Risk ' report would do more for those that desperately need @# education , and they are the ones that we have not touched , " laments former education secretary Terrel Bell , who appointed the 1983 panel and now teaches at the University of Utah . Reporting on inner-city schools last month , the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching reached much the same conclusion : the re-  | form movement " is irrelevant to many children ? largely black and Hispanic ? in our urban schools ... There is . . . a disturbing gap between reform rhetoric and results . " Bennett says one signal achievement of the reform movement has been " discovering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengthening the content of instruction and instituting accountability . But there is still little consensus outside his office on how to achieve those goals . Teachers ' unions still resist many forms of merit pay , alternative certification and competency testing . Some educators think the current wave of test mania is hampering curriculum reforms by encouraging teachers to " teach to the test . " Others say it is the only way to quantify progress and some even call for a national studentachievement test , with results reported state by state . A few experts fear that tougher graduation requirements have actually encouraged marginal students to leave school : " Before the reform movement , they could have slipped by and somehow graduated , " says Albert Shanker , president of the American Federation of Teachers . " Now they ca n't do that and may say , Why hang around ? ' " Lake Wobegon : Pitched battles still rage , at virtually every level , over how much money is needed . " Lack of funding is strangling education reform in state after state , " National Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bennett : " It seems unlikely that we will ever spend enough mon- ey to satisfy the NEA . " Experts can not even agree on seemingly simple statistics . " We 're dealing with dirty data , " says Chris Pipho of the Education Commission of the States , which tries to keep tabs on the actions of 50 states , with 15,747 separate districts , many with different accounting methods . " It 's what I call apples , oranges and peanuts . " The treachery of statistics is nowhere as evident as in the " Lake Wobegon effect " ( named after Garrison Keillor 's mythical town in which " the women are strong , the men are good looking and all the children above-average " ) . West Virginia physician John Cannell noticed that all 50 states were claiming that their students performed above average on standardized tests ? an impossible phenomenon explained , in part , because most states have made gains against national norms that have not been restated in years . Last month Cannell and his grassroots Friends for Education Inc. filed consumer-fraud complaints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what the next waves of reform should stress . In particular , Bennett 's report is expected to call for more focus on the substance of school curricula , now that many schools have added more required courses . Efforts are under way to quantify a basic body of knowledge that students should master . For instance , a new center funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities is working with eminent historians to identify " essential " historical knowledge . Bennett 's report will also advocate granting individual teachers and principals more autonomy so they can develop innovative approaches . On this point , a wide variety of educators , governors and experts agree : after years of burgeoning state regulations , it 's time to try reform from " the bottom up . " Ernest Boyer , president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching , sees autonomy as the key to improving inner-city schools , where progress has been strangled by " mindless regulations . " And the NEA last month urged every state to designate at least one district as " an experimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , schools , for example , more than 50 teachers have voluntarily taken responsibility for the school careers of 20 students . Over several years , they will monitor everything from homework assignments to personal problems . This fall the plan will be extended to all Rochester middle schools . ' Report cards ' : Proponents say the new autonomy must be linked to " accountability , " which Bennett calls the linchpin of renewal . He advocates more state " report cards " on school progress , such as California has developed , and more public reporting of test scores ; only 14 states now release them , school by school , to the public . Bennett also endorses one ultimate form of accountability : allowing more parents and students to choose which public schools to attend ? voting with their feet , as it were ? an option now offered in various degrees in about 20 percent of the nation 's school districts . It is too early to tell how such programs are faring ? or indeed , how effective much of the entire reform effort has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the dilemma we are in , " says Futrell . " And it will take 10 or 15 years to get out . " But the fact that the public fervor for reform has lasted this long is itself one measure of success . " America listened ! " says Jay Sommers , the only teacher on the 1983 panel , now a visiting college professor . The nation must continue to listen and care and seek new avenues of improvement ? particularly in addressing the neediest of America 's youth . Already , one-fifth of the nation 's students live below the poverty line . By 2000 , roughly one-third will be minority or non-Englishspeaking . " They are our future ? they 'll become our voters , our policemen , our firemen ? we 'll be at their mercy , " says Emeral A. Crosby , another member of the 1983 panel , now principal at Detroit 's Pershing High School . Bell puts it another way : " The future is going to belong to the intelligent . " And that must include as many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
