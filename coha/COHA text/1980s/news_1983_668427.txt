Q. Assuming that 10 percent of interest and dividends will be deductedfrom savings accounts , etc. , beginning in July , will you please clarify your recent statement that this also will apply to Savings Bonds . How can this be done ? I presume this would have to be done by the Treasury . If so , will they also do the same with interest on Treasury bills or notes ? - R.V. , Mansfield A. Whenever you cash your US Savings Bonds you will get a sum including the face value of the bond and any accrued interest . If you have held the bond for the minimum period to full maturity ( e.g. for a $25 bond that cost you $17.50 ) , you will be taxed on the $7.50 . If you hold your bond for an extended maturity period , you will be taxed on the $7.50 plus whatever interest earned in the months or years beyond the original maturity date . In either case , the bank will deduct and submit to the Internal Revenue Service in your name 10 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to Amy Bizar , legal counsel at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston , will be handled automatically by the Treasury when either of these securities matures . Under present procedure , if you submitted a bid yesterday for a $10,000 , six-month T-bill you would get a check from the Treasury within a few days for an amount representing the difference between $10,000 and the discounted price of the bill . This sum , in effect , is the interest . Then in July you would get a check for $10,000 representing the face or maturity value of the bill . Bizar explains that under the new procedure , effective July 1 , you still will get a check for the full discount ( or interest ) at the time you buy the bill or note , but when the Treasury mails a check six months from then for the face or maturity value , 10 percent of the interest will have been deducted. - Q. I have some shares of Guardian Chemical Corp. , but have heard nothingfrom the company in years and can ' t find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company ? - J.P. , Wareham A. Once a wholly owned subsidiary of United International Research Inc. , Guardian was merged with the parent last February and the company now is United-Guardian Inc . The stock swap terms were one share of the new company for each .58 of a share of Guardian Chemical . United-Guardian trades Over-the- Counter , last week at about $10 per share , and is quoted daily in the Wall Street Journal ' s Additional OTC list . To keep up-to-date on the company ' s affairs ( and also collect some very small back dividends ) you should submit your old shares for the new to : Continental Stock Transfer &; Trust Co. , 72 Reade st. , New York , N.Y. , 10007 While tracking down the company , I talked by phone with Alfred R. Globus , chairman , president and treasurer who is referred to as " Dr. " Globus . When asked , he said he is a doctor of science , specifically of chemistry . Pharmaceuticals and chemicals are the company ' s bread and butter lines , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expects will be successful . One involves refining of diesel fuel ( " with incredibly low carbon monoxide emissions " ) from coconut oil in the Philippines and the other a tar sands oil project in Alberta , Canada. - Q. I am interested in finding a municipal bond mutual fund that has some Massachusetts obligations in its portfolio to protect against the 10 percent Massachusetts taxes and that has a reasonable initial investment of say $1000 . Fidelity has three or four such funds but they want a $2500 minimum . The T. Rowe Price Bond fund , which I have now , has a $1000 minimum and municipals , but none Massachusetts obligations . Can you list some such funds if there are any ? - T.M. , Saugus A. To my knowledge there is no mutual fund with a portfolio of municipals completely tax-exempt in any one state . Your best bet to accomplish this goal is to buy Tax Exempt Unit Trusts . Five Boston brokerage houses brought out a new issue last week paying 10.40 percent and costing $1007 a unit. - Q. One of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1982 business review section ( 1/2/83 ) that he says suggested that there would be a new 15 percent tax on otherwise tax-exempt municipal bond interest . Is this correct ? - W.F. , Medfield A. Tell your client not to worry ; his bond interest won ' t be taxed . What he read was an article by James Lebherz , a Washington banker and municipal bond specialist , in which a reference was made to a change in tax treatment of commercial bank earnings . In the past , commercial banks that underwrite municipal bond issues have charged to expense any interest cost paid to carry the unsold portion of a new issue , but did not include any interest earnings on the same unsold bonds as taxable income . Under the new tax law only 85 percent of interest costs on the unsold muunicipals can be charged off to expenses by the bank . This change in no way affects the buyer of individual municipals. - Q. I presently have my money in a Boston money fund and am looking for something with higher interest . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their money market thrift certificates . They are offering rates of 12 percent to 14 percent . How safe would my money be ? Am I better off staying with my money fund ? - M.F. , Needham A. I saw Walnut ' s ads and sent for a prospectus . A CPA helped me wander through the balance sheet and we both concluded any company paying substantially more in interest expense than earnings was leading a precarious life . It ' s the old " sleep " factor : Invest if the pretty numbers lure you , but stay away if you are going to lie awake nights worrying .
