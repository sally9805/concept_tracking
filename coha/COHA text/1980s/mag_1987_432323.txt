 | The outdoor playground in the town of Wilmington , N.C. , was called Empie Park . " It was n't Chicago or New York by any means , " recalls Michael Jordan . " But you did have to wait a few hours to get ups . ' Then you had to keep winning to stay on the court . " During the summer before his junior year in high school , when he was growing from 5 feet 11 to 6 feet 3 , Jordan 's waits became shorter , his victories easier . But from such a modest launching pad , even he could n't have known how high the ups would take him . Now 23 and a sculpted 6 feet 6 , Jordan is soaring above the National Basketball Association the way no back-court man ever has . His unprecedented scoring feats for the Chicago Bulls pale alongside the laser-show artistry of his midair moves : his exuberant improvisations and unmatched physical gifts make him arguably the finest athlete in all of sports . The excitement of Jordan 's flights is augmented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury but has returned to reach higher than ever , making each bit of wizardry more breathtaking . " I never try to pace myself , " he says . " I know a lot of people think I 'll wear myself down . Someday maybe I will burn out , physically . But the desire will always burn . I 'll go full speed until I give out . " Jordan wears his single-minded innocence like a badge . When his tongue lolls out of his mouth as he contemplates a move , he looks like a youngster opening a present . His size-34 shorts are two inches longer than normal ; he tugs and hitches them in habitual gestures to get everything just right . Expressive and irrepressible , he is the kid who never had to come in from the playground . He brought it along with him . Because he takes more than a third of his team 's shots and scores an even higher percentage of its points , some have wondered if Jordan bears the selfishness of schoolyard heroes who never quite grow up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighter-than-air creativity with down-to-earth responsibility . " The NBA is an educated playground , " he says . " It 's allowed me to combine all I 've learned about fundamentals with my natural skills . " His learning came from the game 's best textbooks . At the University of North Carolina , he mastered defense , rebounding and all-round team play under coach Dean Smith . Fiercely loyal , Jordan still seeks Smith 's counsel about basketball , high finance and life in general . He treasures trips home to the Chapel Hill Blue Heaven where he can sit on a wall and trade stories with other former Tarheel stars . In the 1984 Olympics , he joined a collection of huge egos under disciplinarian coach Bob Knight . There he proved that he could tone down his brilliance for the team-oriented Knight and still dominate the court . Hallowed floor : In both those settings , championships came quickly . In Chicago , the impossible will take a little while . Without Jordan , the Bulls would have trouble winning in a minor league . With him averaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of the NBA standings . And when he gets to the postseason playoffs , Jordan can pose a threat to anyone . Last spring he made the hallowed parquet floor of Boston Garden his personal springboard when he singed the eventual worldchampion Celtics with a playoff record of 63 points in a game . Jordan has transformed the phrase " one-man team " from a put-down into a compliment . " The other guys would n't work so hard for him if he was n't such a terrific guy , " says rookie Bulls coach Doug Collins . " His example alone makes the other guys better and my job easier . "  | The Celtics , team players personified , echo the sentiments . " I was n't guarding him , " joked defensive ace Dennis Johnson after the 63-point game . " No one was guarding him . No one can guard him . " Larry Bird , perhaps the best all-round player in history , summed up the game 's offensive star : " He 's God disguised as Michael Jordan . " Blessed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linebacker , the spirit of a fighter and the command of a quarterback , Jordan grew up with a sense of his destiny . " In high school I played baseball , football and track , trying to find the right place for my talents , " he says . " As I grew , I found the best target was the basketball court . " His parents , neither of them tall or athletic , encouraged him to excel at whatever he chose . He was devoted to his family , followed their example eagerly and even picked up his tongue-lolling habit from watching his father bent over his garage workbench . " My parents also warned me about the traps , " he says . " The drugs and drink , the streets that could catch you if you got careless . I was lazy about some things . I never got into mowing the lawn or doing hard jobs . But I was n't careless . " " When I met him I wondered how , with all the distractions , he could maintain such mountains of freshness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family and I understood . It sounds corny but it 's true ? love shows . " Jordan finds nothing corny about love for people ? and for his sport . " The game is my wife , " he says . " It demands loyalty and responsibility , and it gives me back fulfillment and peace . " For further evidence , there is a rare clause in Jordan 's contract that allows him to enjoy pickup games ? and risk injury ? whenever he pleases . A love-of-the-game clause . Trying the foot : The love was most severely tested early last season , when Jordan suffered a broken bone in his foot and was forced to miss 64 games . For a few weeks he watched his teammates flounder without him ; then he went home to North Carolina . " My body could stand the crutches , but my mind could n't stand the sideline , " he explains . In Chapel Hill , he worked toward his degree in geography and , to the eventual consternation of Bulls officials , began trying the foot in pickup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , Michael announced he was ready to play . " The doctors said there was a 10 percent chance I 'd reinjure it , " he says . " I figured 90 percent was pretty good odds . I knew I had the desire and the urge . When management did n't want to recognize that , it was the one time I felt treated like a piece of meat . " After a nasty public war of wills , Jordan prevailed . A month later he had his 63-point playoff game . Barring injury ? a threat that haunts fans much more than it does Jordan ? his scoring average for this season will place among the top five in history . The other top places belong to towering Wilt Chamberlain , who inflicted his damage close to the hoop . By bringing the magic outside , Jordan has expanded the horizons of the game . He and his style are key elements in the NBA 's recent surge at box offices and in TV ratings . Even sophisticated students of teamwork can thrill to the raw entertainment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fans in Boston and Los Angeles may be a bit spoiled by years of intricate team chemistry . Hungry fans of teams like the Bulls can find as much delight when Jordan blows up the lab . Jordan certainly ignites foes like Dominique Wilkins , the Atlanta Hawks ' " Human Highlight Film . " Aided by a far superior supporting cast , Wilkins catapulted to 57 points the last time Jordan visited his town . " I guess I make guys feel I 'm invading their turf , " says Jordan . " It 's the old playground code and it adds to the fun . " But even when rivals share the fun , most players agree with Boston 's Danny Ainge : " If you had to choose one highlight film to watch , you 'd pick Michael Jordan 's . " That movie offers multiple plots . There is Jordan aroused , as he was when Seattle 's brash Xavier McDaniel wagged a finger in his face and tried to taunt him . Jordan was n't appeased until he had almost torn apart both the rim and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furious display of slam dunks . There is Jordan unawed , despite the presence of a line o , all-pros between him and the hoop . In Los Angeles , spider-armed defensive specialist Michael Cooper was guarding Jordan on one play . Jordan left Cooper , then pedaled past large and agile James Worthy . He seemed to be descending at last as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar awaited . Instead , he took off again and jammed home a reverse dunk . Downright cruel : Then there is Jordan repeating history . The Celtics were ready for him when he visited Boston for the first time since his 63-point playoff . Larry Bird , for one , dialed up his near-perfect game to a 37-point , 10-assist pitch . All Jordan did was score the first 19 Chicago points of the game and finish with an acrobatic 49 . If Jordan is magnificent against the mighty , he can be downright cruel to teams weaker than his own . In one tight game against the New York Knicks , he merely scored his team 's final 18 points , including the game winner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff , " says Jordan . " If I thought about a move , I 'd probably make a turnover . I just look at a situation in the air , adjust , create and let instinct take over . " Most often , Jordan is compared to Julius Erving , the on-court genius and off-court gentleman who is retiring this season . Jordan wears the mantle with dignity . Besieged for autographs , he signs them all and banters with the kids . Visiting a children 's hospital , he impulsively writes a check for $15,000 . Teammates joke about the millions he makes from the commercial empire that begins with a line of footwear called Air Jordan : " That shoe company should change its name from Nike to Mikey . " But Jordan just smiles and turns the laughs into leadership . " I 've seen stars isolate themselves , " he says . " Not me . I like to go to meals with the guys and pick up the tab , like a quarterback with his linemen . " Relaxing in his suburban town house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in hiring a maid or " servant , " Jordan often watches tapes of his games . " They motivate me to go back to work , " he says , " and when I ca n't sleep , they pass the nights away . " He plans to pass just as smoothly into his early 30s . Then he may turn to his business interests or his passion for golf . " Somebody even said I might be an actor . I do n't think so . But who knows ? " Who knows ? The question is often suspended in the air , like Jordan himself . " Is there ever really a limit on anything ? " he muses . " I think people will always surpass . If it 's me , that 's fine . In the meantime , I 've got the greatest job in America . Could anything be better than getting paid a lot of money to do what you love most ? " Michael Jordan knows . @#              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
