The harder you look at arguments for boxing , the stronger the case against it grows . For example : Boxing isn ' t all that dangerous . People get hurt playing football and in other sports , too . But boxing is the only sport where inflicting brain damage is the main objective . Last week , the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) gave boxing a punching out from which it should never recover . The death rate from boxing injuries is low , JAMA acknowledges . One study counts 335 deaths worldwide between 1945 and 1979 , including amateur and professional fighters . Other research puts the fatality rate at 0. 13 per 1 , 000 fighters . Cuts and bruises are common . So are fractures of the nose , jaw and hand . Damage to the retina of the eye ( such as Sugar Ray Leonard experienced ) from blows to the head or directly to the eye is a more serious and growing concern , but is usually treatable . Chronic , incurable brain damage however , can ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trivialized as being " punch drunk " is a well documented condition that begins with slight mental confusion and unsteadiness in walking and can progress to tremors , staggering , slurred speech , personality disorders and serious mental deterioration , according to a new JAMA report . Punch-drunk symptoms and the pattern of physical injuries that can be found in the brains of victims at autopsy don ' t occur in other athletes . The more blows to the head a fighter has taken ( knockouts or not ) , the more likely he is to have brain damage . Brain deterioration may continue even after a fighter retires . No one knows how many boxers have permanent brain damage , but estimates range from 9 percent to half of all veteran fighters . Why ban boxing ? Why not just change the rules to give more protection to fighters ? Thumbless gloves would help reduce eye injuries . Protective headgear might provide some protection against cuts and bruises , but could produce more , not less , brain injury , experts say . Bouts could be shortened . Blows to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of the " sport " so much that it might be almost as easy to ban it entirely . Fighting is part of human nature . People should be free to fight  --  and to watch fights  --  if they wish . Boxers know the risks and if they want to take them , it ' s their business . Humans aren ' t locked forever into brutal , barbaric behavior . No more shootouts spill blood on Main Street at high noon . Sword fights have been replaced by fencing , and dueling outlawed . Leaders no longer assume they must give the masses gladiators fighting to the death and Christians torn apart by lions . Most parents try to teach their children that fighting isn ' t a good way to settle disputes or test athletic prowess . Making heroes of boxers and televised spectaculars of fights makes it tougher to get these messages across . Boxing provides a ladder out of poverty for young men willing to be aggressive and keep fighting . It is immoral to offer underprivileged young men money for trying to damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse for gambling for the privileged . For every Muhammad Ali ( who has symptoms of brain damage ) , hundreds of other fighters end up both poor and punch drunk . Surely this nation should be teaching the young that the way out of poverty lies in using their brains , not damaging them to provide entertainment , and that there are safer , more potentially successful outlets for athletic abilities than fighting . Boxing is too entrenched to ban . Perhaps not , eventually . The forces calling for change are growing . The AMA and several other medical organizations are pushing for a ban . The American Academy of Pediatrics urges its members to try to nudge young athletes who go in for physical exams into other sports and suggests that parents who allow their offspring to box are child abusers . Norway and Sweden have banned professional boxing . The New Jersey State Commission of Investigation recently recommended outlawing professional boxing , calling it " legal savagery " and declaring that " not even the sturdiest of statutory controls will reduce the brutality of the sport to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and wonder why we tolerated boxing as long as we have.
