If backers of South Africa 's white minority regime kept an enemies list , the Rev. Allan Boesak 's name would be near the very top . The holder of a doctor 's degree in theology , he has emerged during the past decade as the most eloquent opponent of apartheid among the country 's " colored " ( mixed race ) population . Boesak 's influence became international in 1982 when he was chosen president of the Geneva-based World Alliance of Reformed Churches , whose constituency of 50 million includes Presbyterians and Congregationalists . At home and abroad , he has traveled widely to denounce the evils of the apartheid system . <P> Now the churchman 's eminence is imperiled . The reason , as he acknowledges , is that " a relationship exists " between himself and Di Scott , 30 , who is white , divorced and until recently was a youth worker with the South African Council of Churches . Boesak , 38 , the senior vice president of the council , is married and the father of four . Last December Scott moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cape Town area , where Boesak is student chaplain at the University of the Western Cape . <P> The accusation against Boesak emerged in ways that were reminiscent of J. Edgar Hoover 's private allegations that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr . had white mistresses . Late last year an apparently orchestrated attack on Boesak began with the circulation in South Africa of anonymous pamphlets and tape recordings purporting to provide details about the supposed affair . Last month , just as Boesak was playing host to Senator Edward Kennedy , the respected Johannesburg Star reported that state security police were behind the smear campaign . But the paper went on to assert that a Boesak-Scott affair had in fact been going on for some time , and was " well known in church circles . " <P> Boesak swiftly denied that report , thereby assuring leaders of the straitlaced Dutch Reformed Mission Church ( the colored offshoot of the dominant church among white Afrikaners ) that the stories about adultery were false . At the same time , Boesak 's colleagues expressed fury against both the media reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa 's Minister of Law and Order , Louis Le Grange , to defend his department 's behavior on the floor of Parliament . Secret police investigating dissident organizations had stumbled across the fact that Boesak and Scott were meeting " at various hotels , " he said , but the government had done " nothing further " to publicize the discovery , though an affair would be a violation of South Africa 's Immorality Act . Le Grange also filed a complaint with the national press council , contending that the Star had been unfair to the police . <P> The escalating mess forced the Mission Church to undertake its own official investigation , and nine days ago , speaking to thousands of supporters at an ecumenical rally , Boesak seemingly shifted ground . He contended that the rumormongers ' offensive against him , playing upon " human vulnerability " to bolster " repression , " was yet another sign of the " utterly sick society in which we live . Even the church has been used to further the aims of this smear campaign . If this is South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was true , as Boesak put it , that " Miss Scott and I have been working very closely together over the past year . She has been invaluable support for my work . I shall in no way try to explain the meaning of this relationship . "
