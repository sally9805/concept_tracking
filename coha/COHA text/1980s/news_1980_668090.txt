It was another team effort for the Odd Trio - Bjorn Borg , Mariana Simionescu , Lennart Berglin - as it had been since 1976 . And , with one more Wimbledon conquered , Mariana could come in from the cold of the couch , Lennart could resume smiling , and Bjorn could look beyond the cabbage patch of Centre Court to the forbidding slabs of asphalt at Flushing Meadow and the dry crisp record-book pages he intends to inhabit . " It was Mariana ' s idea , not mine , " grins Borg , who doesn ' t want to go down in history as the man who kicked the love of his life out of bed just to win a tennis title . Now it is all part of the Borgian superstitions : the beard untouched by blade during the Wimbledon fortnight , the same unfashionable motel , and Mariana moving to a couch , allowing her man a full innerspring court on which to roam and rest . " Mariana decided to do that in 1976 . I objected , but she insisted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider him an unchivalrous champion . For a while the Odd Trio has split . They reunite briefly in a few days in Bucharest , Mariana ' s hometown , for the wedding of Simionescu and Borg while Bergelin nods approvingly . Lennart Bergelin , the 58-year-old Swedish champion of the immediate post- World War II days , who has served as the prodigy ' s road father for nearly a decade , wasn ' t thrilled when Mariana joined the household . She transformed the Viking Duo into a trio with a dash of Romanian beauty and vibrancy , but for a while Bergelin regarded her third as the well-known crowd . Borg was only 20 , and his coach-confessor-captain was very protective . " Well , obviously it all works out all right , " says Bergelin , who some time ago became convinced that Mariana and Bjorn go together like serve-and-volley on grass , the recently incorporated tactic with which Borg won a fifth successive Wimbledon . " It is a good relaxing situation when we ' re together . When the kids quarrel I don ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . " Mariana says , " We laugh a lot together , and when we make fun of the old man , he ' s good about it . " After the wedding the Borgs vanish to their private island off the coast of Sweden , Bergelin rejoins his own wife and family in Stockholm . The Trio regroups in Toronto midway through August for the Canadian Open , then descends on New York for the US Open , a championship that has made Bjorn look like Harold Stassen pursuing the presidency . He has tapped out in eight previous shots but is " determined to win . Now this has become my most important goal . " Championships and records will fire his competitive greed henceforth , Bjorn asserts . " There ' s no way I can play against Don Budge or Pancho Gonzalez or Rod Laver , " he cites all-time greats who have made their marks during the modern era . " But I want to be considered the greatest in history , so all I can do is try to win more titles , beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four major championships are those of France , England ( Wimbledon ) the United States and Australia . Put them all together in one year and you have a Grand Slam , accomplished only by Budge ( 1938 ) , Laver ( 1962 and 1969 ) , Maureen Connolly ( 1953 ) and Margaret Court ( 1970 ) . " It ' s time to think about the Slam again , " conceded Borg , who began the same brilliant way in 1978 and 1979 by capturing the French Open and Wimbledon , only to crash at Flushing Meadow and give Australia a pass . Not only could he join select company by Slamming , but Borg would also pull even with Roy Emerson , who holds the record for major singles titles , 12 . When he returns to Wimbledon in 1981 Borg launches another history-revising campaign to surpass more dead soldiers and establish himself as the all- encompassing commander- in-ch ief . He has been methodical in overtaking Fred Perry ' s string of championships in three consecutive years 1934-36 , Rod Laver ' s four successive titles ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning streak of 31 . His 35th straight Wimbledon match win in that glorious five-set opus last Saturday , in concert with triumphant loser John McEnroe , permitted Borg to overhaul a shadowy figure called Laurie Doherty , winner of five titles running between 1902 and 1906 . Buried deeper is the last remaining foe , Willie Renshaw , whose line of six titles ran between 1881 and 1886 . In the distant times of Renshaw and Doherty ( and until 1921 ) the challenge-round system was in operation whereby anybody rising through a tournament to victory was required to work only one match the following year : a final against the challenger , who battled through the tournament to take a swing at the champ . Thus Renshaw ' s match win streak over six years was merely 11 . To most it is a dry recital of numbers and barely recalled nonpareils , but Borg is interested and conscious of what he has to do to paint the record book Swedish blue and gold . There was nothing more that he and McEnroe could do to paint their Wimbledon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s importance in their sphere , the demands of a skittish grass court where the ball bounded like a cake of soap skidding across a shower room floor , and the worldwide television attention , this was the ultimate tennis extravaganza . Both Borg and McEnroe played so splendidly , with such variety and ferocity , that the emotional pitch became unbearable to many spectators . Their sustained combat may not have been superior to numerous other great matches - Ken Rosewall-Rod Laver gems , for instance . Such appraisals are usually subjective . Nevertheless this final , certainly No. 1 now for me , will last as long as Wimbledon itself because of the epic impression of shotmaking , athleticism and sportsmanship Borg and McEnroe made on so many million witnesses . McEnroe ' s great performance , good enough to win any championship since Laver ' s of 1969 , only caused Borg to drill for deeper greatness . What can they do for an encore to that rollercoaster 18-16 tie- breaker ? McEnroe killed five match points and Borg six set points before the American drove them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightrope run , but they ' ll be trying when Team Borg coalesces again at the US Open and Mariana goes back to a couch .
