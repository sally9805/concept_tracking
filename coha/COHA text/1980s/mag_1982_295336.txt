The Senator gets the word <P> The intent was apparently to project an air of innocence , as well as optimism about the eventual outcome . The effect , however , was odd , to say the least . As New Jersey 's Democratic Senator Harrison Williams entered a Long Island , N.Y. , federal courtroom for the somber business of being sentenced to prison , he was smiling . Through most of the nearly one-hour court session , he was smiling . He left the courtroom smiling . But when Judge George Pratt ordered him to spend three years behind bars ( out of a maximum of 15 ) and pay a $50,000 fine , Williams showed a deeper emotion : his pallid face momentarily flushed red . <P> Williams was sentenced for his Abscam bribery and conspiracy conviction of last May . A federal jury concluded that he had accepted a secret stock interest in a Virginia titanium mine and had agreed to use his senatorial influence to gain Government contracts to make the mining venture profitable . The jury also found that Williams had agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man offering to sweeten the deal with a $100 million loan , an FBI agent posing as an Arab sheik . The transaction was surreptitiously videotaped by investigators and later shown on television news programs . <P> Williams ' attorney pleaded with Judge Pratt to give the Senator a suspended sentence , arguing that his career was ruined . Prosecutor Thomas Puccio countered that Williams had " put his office up for sale " and " boldly lied to avoid conviction . " <P> If Williams does not gain a reversal of his conviction , he will be only the second Senator to go to prison for crimes committed while in office . He could also become the first Senator in 120 years to be expelled by his colleagues . The Senate is scheduled to meet next week to consider a recommendation by its ethics committee to remove Williams . There will be great pressure on the Senators to show that they have the will to enforce their own standards of conduct . But the Senate is a clubby place , and some members may push for mere censure or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of entrapment and wonder how they would have responded in Williams ' place . Others resent the fact that Williams has not resigned . One thing is certain : few Senators will be smiling at the hour of judgment .
