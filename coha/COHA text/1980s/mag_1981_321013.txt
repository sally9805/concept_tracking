New energy at an old dam <P> Since one nuclear power plant can take a decade and more than $3 billion to build , and scares nearly everyone living within 50 miles , it may be better to build dozens of quietly humming , nonpolluting small dams to generate electricity . They could nestle right into some long-abandoned textile-or lumbermill dam , and draw their power from the flowing river water . That is a proposal now being tested in several New England states . <P> Like the wood stove and the windmill , hydroelectric power is making a comeback . This week the largest such plant to open in New England in more than half a century will be dedicated in Lawrence , Mass . Project promoters proudly wear bright red buttons that read ONE DAM SITE BETTER . <P> The structure sits unobtrusively at one end of the Great Stone Dam , a 900-ft-long , 40-ft. - high granite block structure that spans the broad Merrimack River . When that old dam was built in 1848 , it was the engineering marvel of its time and provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the dam fell into relative disuse in the 1950s , when the city 's thriving textile industry withered as factories moved south . <P> In 1976 a group of six Massachusetts investors approached the Essex Co. , an old-line New England firm that had initially built and continued to own the dam , with a proposal to build a hydroelectric plant there . Company stockholders were receptive because the dam faced financial troubles . The Department of the Interior had ordered the company to construct a $1.5 million fish ladder to help the Merrimack River 's growing schools of Atlantic salmon move upstream to spawn . The company stockholders agreed to sell out to the investment group , which later formed a partnership with E G &; G , a Wellesley , Mass. , energy-equipment company ( 1980 sales : $613 million ) . Financing for the $28 million project came from Chase Manhattan Bank , Mutual of New York insurance company and two smaller New England banks . <P> When fully operational , the plant is expected to generate enough electrical power to meet the needs of 17,000 homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , a profit that few utilities can match . Says Essex Chairman Jacek Makowski : " A hydro project can be viewed as an oil well with unlimited resources . Once you have the capital investment finished , you are good for 50 years , maybe longer . " <P> The ambitious Lawrence dam partners now have several more hydropower sites in New England under development . They are building a $6.3 million project on the Contoocook River near Concord , N.H. , and a $2 million one on the Wells River in Vermont . The two dams will serve a total of about 5,000 customers . <P> The new hydroelectric-power generation in New England is due in part to advances in turbine technology for " low head " dams . The new turbines produce electricity by having water flow horizontally , under modest pressure , against the blades of the turbine . The machines look something like submarines sitting on the bed of the river . Traditional hydroelectric dams like the Hoover Dam on the Arizona-Nevada border must be hundreds of feet tall so that the water can fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turbines . Although low-head dams are widely used in Europe , relatively few of those in the U.S. generate electricity .
