 | In the fall of 1988 , Moira , a slender but athletic redhead , began her freshman year at a prestigious Southern California university . Planning to major in premed and go on to medical school , she was enthusiastically carrying a heavy load of math and science courses and making friends in the coed dorm where she lived . Then , one Saturday night in December , her whole life changed when she attended a dorm " floor party . " Moira had had a little to drink but was not intoxicated when a boy named Dan , whom she knew only slightly , suggested she go to his room , where , he said , " most of our buddies are . " She had no reason to be wary of a " dorm brother , " so she went with him ? only to find when they got to the room that no one else was there . Dan closed the door and moved toward Moira . She pushed him away , but he was strong enough to throw her down on the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's door ? several of his friends , laughing . Startled , he moved off her just enough to give her a chance to escape . Halfdressed , she rushed screaming down the hall to her own room , where she threw off her clothes , took a shower , then lay shivering and nauseous on her bed . Witnesses who had heard her cries for help could have helped substantiate her story when she went to the university dean the next day ? but they did n't . When word got around the dorm , most of Dan 's friends were angry that Moira had tried to get Dan " in trouble . " After all , she 'd gone to his room , had n't she ? Was n't she inviting something to happen ? She took her semester finals in a daze , and from then on her grades spiraled down . She could n't sleep or eat . Most of all she could n't stop replaying the attack in her mind , berating herself for how stupid she 'd been . She even began to doubt her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy 's room had she signaled that she wanted to have sex ? Close to a nervous breakdown , she finally dropped out of college . The happy eighteen year old who started her college life so successfully will never go back to the university ; she may never return to college at all . Shocking and poignant as Moira 's  | case is , it is not a rare freak occurrence . Rape has become increasingly common on college campuses across the country . Most often the incidents are " acquaintance " or " date " rapes that do not end in severe injuries ? although certainly there is serious psychological damage . Sometimes , though , a sexual attack ends in murder . In January 1989 a group of some 250 psychologists , law enforcement officers , and students who attended the Third Annual Conference on Campus Violence at Towson State ( Md . ) University estimated that 13 to 25 percent of all college women become victims of rape or attempted rape . A 1985 survey of 32 campuses conducted by Ms. Magazine , the National Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor of psychiatry at the University of Arizona School of Medicine , puts the ratio at closer to one in six within a one-year period . Dr. Koss further found that most of the rapes occurred on campus and that 84 percent of the women knew their assailants . Sexual violence has now surpassed theft as the number one security concern at U.S. universities . Most parents of today 's students remember a different , gentler campus life in which men and women lived in separate dorms and adhered to curfews . Today male and female students often share the same dorms , and there simply are n't the demarcation ? privacy ? lines there once were . Someone who only looks familiar may be mistakenly assumed to be trustworthy just because he 's a fellow student ? as was Moira 's rapist . Nor is it unusual to see a stranger walking the corridors and assume he lives on the next floor . How does an intruder get in ? Students quickly learn to prop open doors or bypass locks so they can come and go easily . In 1989 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs , widely used at campus parties , can be catalysts for an offender while rendering his victim less able to resist attack . Most parents are unaware that rehabilitation programs for criminals ? sometimes sex offenders on probation or parole ? often take place on college campuses . This puts convicted sex offenders in the classroom right next to students , sometimes even living in the same dorm . Yet privacy laws forbid disclosure of offenders ' identities . But there is a deeper , more complex root cause of campus rapes than mixed-sex dorms and drugs and alcohol . The sad fact is that some young men of the current college generation hold dangerously outdated ideas about women and sex . They feel that if a girl allows a boy to visit her room ? or if she drinks too much ? she is necessarily inviting sexual activity . There is evidence that the misconceptions are learned early . A recent survey of 1,700 students , ages 12 to 15 , conducted by a Rhode Island Rape Crisis Center revealed a shocking attitude : Onefourth of the boys and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " force " a woman to have sexual intercourse if he had spent money on her on a date . What leads " nice , respectable " young men to feel they have a right to force sex ? Mark Stevens , a psychologist at the University of Southern California , believes that the confusion of sexuality with violence begins with the old notion of " scoring . " " The attitude that women are objects and that treating them in a demeaning way makes a boy cool ' and in control gets passed along from peers , older brothers , and media images ? especially those in the pornographic magazines , " says Stevens . Recent headlines dramatizing the rise in sex offenses by teenagers show just how early these attitudes are formed : The Glen Ridge , N.J. scandal , for instance , in which five  | 18-year-old boys have been charged with sexually attacking a mentally impaired 17-year-old girl ; the brutal rape and beating of a female jogger in New York City 's Central Park by a gang of youths , at least one as young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapeprevention courses that spread the message that forced sex is wrong . Mark Stevens conducts such a workshop at USC in which he tries to teach young men to be more empathetic to women and to view sexuality in a sensitive , humane way . The University of Florida , Cornell University , and UCLA , among others , also have excellent programs in place . It 's not just young men who need new conditioning . Young women take in the same social messages as men do , and they can be just as confused about sexuality . Freshman girls , eager to appear sophisticated , are particularly vulnerable targets for date rape . When it does happen , it 's easy for the victim to feel that it was somehow her fault . Humiliated , ashamed , many young women want only to shove the memory of what happened into the farthest corner of their minds . Like Moira , many tragically drop out of college rather than live so close ? sometimes next door ? to the man who has attacked them . Given this tendency to blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many college women are reluctant to report a rape . And often it does seem prudent not to , since university officials often are either unable ? or unwilling ? to deal with the issue . For one thing , rape is difficult to prove in court . For another , they do n't want to admit to any laxity in campus security . Security measures cost money and , more expensive to colleges , bad publicity can hurt enrollment . Gail Abarbanel , founder and director of the Rape Treatment Center at the Santa Monica ( Calif . ) Hospital Medical Center , has heard a long list of college rape horror stories in which the victims ' rights were treated as if secondary to those of their assailants . One young woman suffered through 14 interviews with college officials , but her attacker was never even called to answer her charges . In another case , a 17-year-old freshman girl felt she had no choice but to drop her charges against a star college athlete when she was told by school authorities that he could have a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even bring in her mother or a friend to speak for her . Abarbanel finds that it is still rare for most colleges to hold disciplinary hearings for students accused of rape . " I can think of only one such hearing in 60 cases , " she says . Traumatic as rape is , there can be even worse dangers on campus . It took a particularly chilling tragedy ? and two devastated but determined parents ? to finally call attention to the serious problem of lax campus security . Always careful about keeping their own security system on at home , Connie and Howard Clery of Bryn Mawr , Pa. had been reassured to see that the Lehigh University dorm where their daughter , Jeanne , lived had three locks ? on an outside door , an inner door at the stairwell , and a door at each floor . The students ' rooms each had locks , too . Secure in the belief that the locked outer doors kept strangers out , Jeanne and her roommate often left their room door unlocked so the latecomer would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of April 5 , 1986 Jeanne 's roommate had a date ; Jeanne left the door unlocked for her , then went to sleep . Someone else entered Jeanne 's room ? her rapist and murderer . Perhaps startled when Jeanne awakened and found him rifling through her things , possibly planning to attack her all along , the intruder tried to cut her throat with a bottle , beat and raped her . . . then strangled her to death . The murderer , Joseph Henry , a fellow student who  | lived in another dormitory , was arrested two days later . He had been able to enter his victim 's dorm because ? not a surprise ? the latch on the outer door had been left propped open . The grieving Clerys sued Lehigh University for negligence and were awarded a purported $2 million . They have used the money to form " Security On Campus , " a clearinghouse for information on college safety , and to lobby for state bills stressing campus safety ? so that other parents ' children would be protected from violent crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every college in Pennsylvania to provide prospective students with information relating to the school 's crime statistics and security measures upon request . Thanks in part to their efforts , similar legislation has been passed in Florida and Tennessee and is pending in New York , New Jersey , Massachusetts , and California . If many universities have instituted rape-prevention courses , most still refuse to discuss their responsibility to provide adequate security . In 1983 a freshman at Cornell University , Erin Nieswand , was murdered in her dorm by an irrational young man who had paced the halls of his victim 's dorm for more than an hour , carrying a loaded rifle . The girl 's parents are now suing Cornell . In papers filed in court , however , the university denies that it had any legal duty to provide adequate security for students . In 1986 a Clarkson College ( Potsdam , N.Y. ) sophomore , Katy Hawelka , was viciously attacked and raped on campus . She died a few days later . Again , college officials denied they had any responsibility . What can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to college ? The Clerys have formulated a questionnaire on campus security that they urge parents to send in with each college application . ( See address below . ) Another excellent resource , the Santa Monica Rape Treatment Center , provides helpful brochures . Of course , parents should check out campus living arrangements for themselves . Then they may want to give their collegebound daughter this advice : 1 . If you intend to drink , drink moderately . 2 . Do n't give out too much information about yourself to a new acquaintance or a stranger . 3 . Always lock your dorm-room door . 4 . Never walk alone on campus at night . If you must attend an evening class , arrange for a good friend to escort you . 5 . Walk across campus confidently , head up , shoulders back . If you look depressed , ill , or distracted you are a prime target . 6 . Do n't automatically trust police badges , men with " broken " arms or legs , or men with a sad " story . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Mark Stevens , is instilling good sexual values in both boys and girls . He especially urges parents to start early in conveying to boys that sex means infinitely more than " scoring " ? and that " no " to a sexual invitation means no . For if their sons grow up learning to respect women , to have a sense of responsibility toward them , parents wo n't have to be so concerned about sending their daughters off to college armed with selfdefense strategies .
