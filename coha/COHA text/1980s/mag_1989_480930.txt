From " Hackers in Jail , " by Eric Corley , in the Spring issue of 2600 , the " hacker quarterly . " The magazine is published in Setauket , New York . In July , Kevin Mitnick , one of the hackers discussed in this editorial , was sentenced to a year in prison . By now you 've probably all heard about Kevin Mitnick . Mitnick , twenty-five , is an overweight , bespectacled computer junkie known as a " dark-side " hacker for his willingness to use a computer as a weapon . He allegedly used a computer to break into Defense Department computer systems , sabotage business computers , and electronically harass anyone ? including a probation officer and FBI agents ? who got in his way . He was arrested late last year , after being turned in by a friend who said Mitnick was " a menace to society . " Mitnick has an amazing history , to say the least . He and a friend logged into a North American Air Defense Command computer in Colorado Springs in 1979 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation . They just " got in , looked around , and got out . " Investigators believe that Mitnick also may have disseminated a false report , carried by a news service in April 1988 , that Security Pacific National Bank lost $400 million . The report appeared four days after Mitnick had been turned down for a job at Security Pacific . He also learned how to disrupt telephone-company operations and disconnected the phones of celebrities such as Kristy McNichol . Last February , Herbert Zinn Jr. , an eighteenyear-old hacker who broke into U.S. military and AT &T; computers , was sentenced to nine months in federal prison . A dropout from Mather High School in Chicago , Zinn ( a.k.a . " Shadow Hawk " ) was sixteen at the time he committed the intrusions , using his home computer and a modem . Zinn penetrated a Bell Labs computer in Naperville , Illinois , an AT &T; computer in Burlington , North Carolina , and another AT &T; computer at Robbins Air Force base in Georgia . He copied fifty-five programs , including complex software relating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material was involved , the government claims that the programs he copied from a NATO computer linked with the U.S. missile command are " highly sensitive . " During his trial in January , Zinn spoke in his own defense , saying that he copied the programs to educate himself and not to sell them or share them . Zinn is still in jail . hen people actually start going to jail for playing with computers , it 's time to ask some very serious questions . Let 's start with Mitnick . Here we have what appears to be a nasty , vindictive human being . But is this reason enough to lock him up without bail ? In normal times in almost any democratic society , the answer would be a resounding no . But there are special circumstances here : computers . Doing nasty things with computers is considered infinitely worse than doing nasty things without computers . As a result , Mitnick had less success seeking bail than he would if he had been charged with murder . Prison authorities would n't even let him use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment that computers do n't exist . Mitnick disconnects Kristy McNichol 's phone using wire clippers . That 's vandalism , maybe trespassing , good for a fine of maybe $100 . He and a friend walk into the North American Air Defense Command Center one day . They do n't break anything and they soon leave . Had they been caught , they would have been thrown off the grounds or , at worst , arrested for trespassing and held overnight . ( The person who left the door unlocked would be fired . ) In our society such a person would be classified as a mischief-maker . Such people exist everywhere . But because Mitnick used computers to perform his mischief , he 's treated as though he 's another John Hinckley . Society is indeed endangered by what 's happening here , but that 's not Mitnick 's fault . He simply demonstrated how vulnerable our information ? and our way of life has become . If one person can cause such chaos , then clearly the system is falling apart at the seams . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ languishing in prison because he did n't know when to curb his intellectual curiosity . The newspapers accused Zinn of stealing software , but all he did was copy some programs . If these programs were so valuable , why in hell was he able to download them over the phone lines ? The message here is that some of our nation 's brightest kids are being imprisoned for being a little too inquisitive , and that 's frightening . Much can be learned from what hackers uncover . Hackers may not be knights in shining armor , but the notion that they are dangerous criminals could not be further from the truth . These are kids doing what kids have always done . The only difference is that they 've learned how to use a tool that most people have ignored . And until more of us know how to use that tool , there will be many more abuses ? not just abuses of the tool but abuses by the tool . That 's where the real danger lies . Hacking is not wrong . Hacking is healthy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design flaws and security deficiencies . Above all , hacking proves that the ingenuity of a single mind is still the most powerful tool of all . We are hackers . We always will be . Our spirits will not be crushed by these horrible events . Call us co-conspirators , fellow anarchists , whatever you want . We intend to keep learning . To suppress this desire is contrary to everything that is human . Like the authors who rose to defend Salman Rushdie from the long arm of hysteria , we must rise to defend those endangered by the hacker witch-hunts . After all , they ca n't lock us all up . And unless they do , hacking is here to stay .
