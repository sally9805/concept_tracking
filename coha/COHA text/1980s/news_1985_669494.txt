Take Apple Computer , which practically created the personal computer industry . When IBM brought out its own PC , the most profitable customers , the business community , jumped on the IBM bandwagon . IBM now has some 60 percent of the business market. // // At the other end of the spectrum , IBM ' s shadow has stunted the growth of mainframe computermakers . IBM has a lock on some 70 percent of the mainframe business ; Burroughs , Sperry , Honeywell , NCR , and Control Data have to fight over the rest. // So how did Mr. Olsen steer his minicomputer firm past these bigger companies to take the No. 2 spot in the computer industry ? // In part , he caught IBM asleep at the switch . By the time IBM seriously turned its attention to minicomputers ( which range from $10 , 000 to about $450 , 000 ) , Digital was entrenched . It had already developed a vast and loyal customer base ; in fact , there are more Digital computers out there than IBMs , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the luxury of an indifferent IBM . Big Blue has taken aim at the $15 billion midsize market , and DEC ( pronounced ' ' deck ' ' ) in particular . In 1984 IBM outsold DEC in minicomputers ( in dollars , not units ) , according to the Gartner Group , a research firm. // Competition is also coming from smaller companies , like Data General , which sell faster , more-powerful machines for less money. // And , of course , the computer slump has taken its toll , though not as severely as for most of DEC ' s competitors . After a decade in which sales and profits grew tenfold , Digital ' s profits last quarter were half what they were in the same quarter last year . ( They were down 11 percent , if a one-time tax benefit from last year is excluded. ) // Why , then , does Marc Schulman at Salomon Brothers predict an earnings growth of 35 to 40 percent a year for the next three years ? Or why does Daniel Chertoff at Sanford Bernstein Research call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting stronger - we ' re only beginning to see what it will do ' ' ? // Explains Mr. Chertoff , ' ' For DEC , the key to profitability is the product cycle , and they are at the beginning of a long and sustained product cycle . ' ' In the next few months , DEC is expected to unveil an IBM-compatible personal computer , a midrange VAX minicomputer , and a new engineering work station . In the last year , it has brought out its two most profitable machines ever - the VAX 8600 and MicroVax II - and they are hot . It also has high hopes for the new top-of-the-line 8650. // But there are more fundamental reasons for optimism , says Mr. Schulman . ' ' The computer industry has played into DEC ' s hands , ' ' he says . ' ' For a good number of years , their major theme has been networking . They were way ahead of their time. ' ' // ' ' Networking ' ' allows different computers to share information or ' ' talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept that Digital has emphasized for 15 years , Olsen says , but only recently - with the explosive growth of personal computers - has it become a top priority. // ' ' The personal computer almost by definition is for an individual , ' ' Olsen says . ' ' But a corporate entity means everybody working together . So tying a whole organization together is an obvious need . Suddenly people realized they had made these major investments and they did not have the usefulness they had hoped for. ' ' // Indeed , the minicomputer market does seem to be veering in Digital ' s direction . Hardware is becoming a commodity item ; it ' s the software that counts . Analysts estimate that for every $1 of computer hardware a customer buys , it will spend $3. 50 on software and services over the life of the machine. // All of DEC ' s VAX computers can be upgraded or married to small computers without throwing out software . And since the VAX concept was introduced in the mid- ' 70s , practically every engineer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had more power for the dollar than IBM mainframes . So universities and small engineering companies at the cutting edge of computer technology worked on DEC computers. // Today , other companies are doing to Digital what it did to IBM : giving more power at a cheaper price . But Digital ' s dominance isn ' t immediately threatened , says Kenneth Flamm , a research associate at the Brookings Institution . ' ' Unless the hardware has to be dedicated to a specific function , ' ' he says , ' ' it makes sense to buy a computer that runs the broadest range of software. ' ' // It won ' t all be smooth sailing for DEC . IBM is coming on strong : It has captured 22 percent of the computer-aided design and manufacturing ( CAD/CAM ) market , a traditional DEC stronghold , according to the Gartner Group . And though DEC ' s office automation system , All-in-1 , has sold well , IBM still holds sway over departmental managers who order computers. // There is some controversy whether IBM is doing better at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at getting into the office . Most believe DEC is gaining in the office and will continue to gain at IBM ' s expense . First , DEC ' s VAX series is better than IBM minicomputers like the System 36 , they say . Also DEC - which has always said that good machines sell themselves - is starting to beat the bushes for customers. // ' ' DEC is a much more laid-back company than IBM , ' ' says one customer who is looking to replace a Digital mainframe that is being phased out . This customer is trying to decide between an IBM and a Digital system. // ' ' There ' s a loyalty ' ' toward Digital , the customer says , ' ' but IBM is always hustling , sales-wise . . . . I haven ' t seen people talking to Data General or Prime or Hewlett-Packard ; they ' re going to IBM. ' ' // One reason for DEC ' s ' ' laid back ' ' attitude is that its sales force is in on salary , not commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bonus program for high-performance salespeople , the first such incentive ever. // There have been other changes made of late that indicate DEC is not taking its position for granted. // DEC sat out the personal computer boom . When it did bring out a less expensive PC , the Rainbow , it was ' ' a turkey , ' ' one customer says . But next spring Digital will be bringing out an IBM-compatible PC . Analysts say the $5 , 000 to $7 , 000 machine could allow Digital to hold IBM at bay in the lower end of the market and could help Digital penetrate IBM ' s fiefdom in the office. // DEC ' s lackadaisical attitude about utilization of its assets ( thus profitability ) is changing , too . Last year Olsen recruited James Osterhoff , a former Ford executive , to head the finance department , and profit margins are already expanding , analysts say. // In a volatile industry , Digital ' s stability is a plus and a minus . One analyst says DEC doesn ' t want to be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They let the pioneers get the arrows in the back. ' ' // In fact , he says , DEC ' s best strategy - and biggest challenge - may be to act a little less like IBM. // //
