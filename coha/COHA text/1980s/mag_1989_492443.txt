// Editor 's note : When Malcolm Forbes , a billionaire magazine mogul and the author of six books , was asked why he would want to write about death , his response was : " This is not .. about death , but rather about sat  --  isfying an oft-expressed curiosity on the part of ' We , the Living . ' " Because death is life 's only certain  --  ty , and because being against it is n't apt to affect the result , Forbes feels that dwelling on the subject can be a woeful , wanton waste of time . How  --  ever , reflecting on the number of times in casual conversation a well-known name pops up and someone asks , " Whatever became of him/her ? " he set about recording the extraordinary " exits " of some of history 's most famous and infamous personalities . In doing so , 1w uncovered some pretty fascinating stuff , including one fa  --  mous person who died enjoying The Saturday Evening Post . Benjamin Franklin January 17 , 1706-April 17 , 1790 Benjamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be said to be cer  --  tain except death and taxes . " The wise and wisecracking self-made statesman helped lead a revolution over taxes , but when his death was near he wel  --  comed it with characteristic good humor . Franklin celebrated life and ascribed much of his happiness to two simple health tips : hot baths and cold fresh air . He slept with an open win  --  dow and he said , " I rise almost every morning and sit in my chamber with  --  out any clothes whatever , half an hour or an hour , according to the season , either reading or writing . This prac  --  tice is not in the least painful , but , on the contrary , agreeable . " It might have made him happy , but it did n't keep him well . Franklin had severe lung ailments as a young adult and he suffered gout for decades . While minister to France in 1782 , he developed a painful bladder stone that restricted his activity for the rest of his life . After he returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of di  --  plomacy abroad , his pain grew worse so that by 1789 he was almost bedrid  --  den . His characteristic chubby form was diminished by the pain-relieving opiates he took . " For my own person  --  al ease , 1 should have died two years ago , " he wrote to George Washington after his inauguration in 1789 . " But , though those years have been spent in excruciating pain , I am pleased that I have lived them , since they have brought me to see our present situa  --  tion " ? namely , the new nation . In early April 1790 , Franklin devel  --  oped an abscess in his Ieft lung that left him barely able to breathe . He continued to write and entertain visi  --  tors between fits of pain . During one bad spell he told a visitor , " On , no , do n't go away . These pains will soon be over . They are for my good , and besides , what are the pains of a mo  --  ment in comparison with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pain suddenly subsided . Franklin got up from his bed and asked that it be made up fresh so he could " die in a decent manner . " His daughter told him she hoped he would recover . " Ihope not , " he replied . On April 17 the abscess in his lung burst . Someone suggested he shift his position in bed so he could breathe more easily . " A dying man can do nothing easy , " Franklin said , then felt into a coma . Death overtook the 84 ? year-old at 11 p.m. as his two grand  --  sons watched . His doctor believed that Franklin himself had caused the fatal lung ailment by sitting for hours be  --  fore an open window . Franklin might have gotten a kick out of that . After all , his Poor Richard said , " Nine men in ten are suicides . " Warren Harding November 2 , 1865-August 2 , 1923 " My God , this is a h ? of a job ! " Warren Harding said of his presiden  --  cy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I can take care of my enemies all right . But my d ? friends , my g  --  d ? friends , they 're the ones that keep me walking the floor nights ! " Harding was hardly the most capable man to live in the White House . The prominent Ohio newspaper editor and Republican got there in 1920 by being handsome and likable , which was just what voters wanted after the stormy years of Woodrow Wilson . Harding was n't a strong leader , nor was he especially bright . He left much of his work to his aides , who would present him with simplified versions of the complicated problems of the nation . Still , Harding complained , " 1 never find myself done . " By the third year of this term , in the spring of 1923 , it became clear that Harding had left far too much to his aides . The director of the Veterans Bureau , Charles Forbes , was caught selling government supplies illegally , and he fled to Europe . Shortly after , Charles Cramer , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on the scam , shot himself in the head . Several weeks after that , the Attorney General 's private secretary , who ran his own racket selling liquor licenses during Prohibition , also shot himself in the head . At the time the scandals remained private , and the public was told the suicides had resulted from financial and health problems . But Harding knew the real stories would get out sooner or later . Already weak from an illness , and depressed over his unruly aides , Harding that summer embarked on a cross-country trip to Alaska . The President wanted to get away from Washington and also hoped to drum up support during his train stops . But Harding could n't get over his anxiety about the simmering scandals . When his ship , returning from Alaska , rammed an escort vessel in heavy fog as it entered Puget Sound , Harding did n't leave his cabin but grumbled , " I hope the boat sinks . " Safely on shore in Seattle , Harding was giving a speech on July 27 when he seemed to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rushed to his train , which sped to San Francisco . The White House physician diagnosed the prob  --  lem as ptomaine poisoning that Har  --  ding had gotten from eating crab-meat . But once the President arrived in San Francisco on July 29 and was examined in his suite at the Palace Hotel , doctors correctly diagnosed that Harding was suffering from heart trouble and pneumonia . Harding rested in bed and seemed to get better . But on August 2 at 7:30 p.m. , as his wife was reading to him a highly com  --  plimentary article about him from The Saturday Evening Post , called " A Calm Review of a Calm Man , " Har  --  ding suddenly shivered and died . Doctors said either his heart wall had ruptured or a blood vessel in his brain had burst . Either way , Har  --  ding 's death stunned the nation , which had been told only that he had eaten some bad crabmeat . The suspi  --  cions about what really had killed the President began when it was learned that Harding had n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , refused to allow an autopsy , there were rumors that she had poi  --  soned him . And after the Harding ad  --  ministration scandals began breaking a few months after his death , there were rumors that Harding had killed himself . There was n't a shred of evidence to support either claim , but the coming months and years provided plenty ofmotives . Within three months of Har  --  ding 's death the real story of the Veterans Bureau broke , as did the more serious Teapot Dome scandal , in which Harding 's men sold oil leas  --  es for bribes . Harding 's Attorney General , Harry Daugherty , was deep  --  ly investigated by the Senate for im  --  proprieties that involved a group of Harding 's friends known as the " Ohio gang . " Several of Harding 's administration ended up in prison . Closer to home , a woman named Nan Britton published a book in 1927 called The President 's Daughter , in which she alleged that Harding was the father of her illegitimate child and that their affair had lasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Harding had carried on a long af  --  fair with the wife of a leading business  --  man in his hometown of Marion , Ohio . It also became known that Har  --  ding drank and served liquor in the White House during Prohibition . Harding once said , " I can not hope to be one of the great presidents , but perhaps I may be remembered as one of the best-loved . " Perhaps not , but at least he was n't around to know it . Leslie Howard April 3 , 1893-June 1 , 1943 Leslie Howard , the handsome , wistful actor who played the noble Ashley Wilkes in Gone with the Wind , was regarded just as honorably off the screen . As early as 1939 , when it was apparent that England might be headed for war , the British actor gave up his soaring Hollywood career as a romantic leading man to return home and help the war effort . He act  --  ed in and directed a series of morale-boosting war movies and conducted half-hour encouraging radio shows . Just like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he was a gen  --  tleman with guts , " one friend said . In the spring of 1943 , Howard went to Spain and Portugal for a lecture tour on filmmaking and to explore the possibility of producing movies there . On his way back to England on June 1 , he was one of 13 passengers on a British Overseas Airways DC-3 that took off at 9:40 a.m. from Lisbon . More than an hour later , as the plane flew high above the clouds over the Bay of Biscay , it was at  --  tacked by six German fighter planes . That was unusual , because the civil  --  ian plane was on what had been con  --  sidered a neutral flight path . No planes had been disturbed along the route in three years of war . The pilot radioed for help , and that was the last ever heard or seen of the flight . One of the German flyers said later that he saw the plane burst into flames and dive toward the sea . The back door of the plane was pushed open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only one parachute un  --  furled , and that caught fire , sending its carrier plunging with the rest . Was Howard just another innocent victim of the war ? That has never been made entirely clear . It is most widely believed that the plane was shot down because the Germans thought Winston Churchill was on board . The British Prime Minister was known to be in North Africa and presumed to be heading home soon . Another passenger on the flight , Alfred Chenhalls , an accountant and Howard 's tax adviser , looked some  --  what like Churchill and smoked equally large cigars . But it is also possible that Howard was the real target . German leaders were known to be angered by his prop  --  aganda work . More mysterious are reports that Howard met with German spies while he was in Lisbon and that he was on some kind of British recon  --  naissance mission himself . Whatever the cause , Howard 's death shocked England like few oth  --  ers . One chronicler said the actor had been deeply popular because he char  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars . " He fitted well into the pause between battles and will be remembered not only because he was an accomplished actor but because he suited the mood of those moments . " That he was dead was yet another reminder that the pause was gone forever . Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller July 8 , 1908-January 26 , 1979 Any man whose birth was an  --  nounced on the front page of the New York Times , who served every presi  --  dent since FDR except Kennedy , who sought the presidency three times and was vice president under Ford and governor of New York for 15 years certainly would expect to receive sub  --  stantial attention when he died . What Nelson Rockefeller , also a grandson of the founder of Standard Oil , prob  --  ably did n't expect was the sloppiness of the event . The first report , emblazoned with a three-column headline on the front page of the New York Times Saturday morning , announced that Rockefeller had died of a heart attack at 10:15 the night before while working at his desk on the 56th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  cording to longtime family spokesman Hugh Morrow , Rockefeller had had dinner with his family at their Fifth Avenue duplex before he went to the office . A bodyguard had been unable to revive him , Morrow said . Later Saturday , Morrow recanted his first statements . Rockefeller had died not in his main office but in his town house at 13 West 54th Street , which adjoined another of his offices . And he had n't suffered the heart at  --  tack at 10:15 p.m. but after 1 I p.m. , just before 911 emergency medical services was called at 11:16 . Morrow said police had found Rockefeller ly  --  ing unconscious on the living-room floor . Also present , he said , were a bodyguard and a 31-year-old woman with whom Rockfeller had been work  --  ing , Megan Marshack . That was grist for Sunday 's news  --  papers . By Monday , along withsolemn accounts of the funeral , they were publishing the transcript of Marshack 's frantic call to 911 : " It 's death ! It 's immediate ! Please ! " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 , not 31 . She had been a reporter for the Associated Press before joining Rockefeller 's staff in Washington in 1975 when he was vice president . She was one of the few who had been kept on when he re  --  turned to private life in New York in 1977 . Marshack and Rockefeller had been working on a book about his modern art collection when he died , according to the newspaper stories . The revisions continued . It turned out Rockefeller 's heart attack did oc  --  cur at 10:15 p.m. ? an hour before 911 was called  --  and Marshack had n't made the call . A voice analysis of the tape confirmed that help had been summoned by Ponchitta Pierce , the hostess of a weekend NBC-TV show who owned a co-op in the same build  --  ing as Marshack a few doors from Rockefeller 's town house . Pierce had gone over to the town house after Marshack called her , then returned home after calling 911 . Also it turned out there had been no bodyguard in Rockefeller 's town house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Marshack was wearing a long black hostess gown , the New York Daily News called it a housecoat and said there were no papers to indicate that they had been working on the art book , only food and wine sitting on a table . Whether there was more to the story or not was never published , though it certainly has been the sub  --  ject of much speculation and rumor . The final note came at the reading of the will . Rockefeller had forgiven a $45,000 loan he 'd given Marshack so she could buy her co-op . Babe Ruth February 6 , 1895-August 16 , 1948 " The Bambino , " " The Sultan of Swat , " " Wizard of Wham , " " Bazoo of Bang . " Sportswriters stretched further and further to tag baseball 's greatest legend , the owner of 54 major-league records , including 714 career home runs and 60 home runs in one season , both of which stood for more than 30 years . The stocky , pug-nosed New York Yankee fielder was always affable but also knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sion , in 1931 , he was pressured to take a $10,000 pay cut in his $80,000 salary . " Root , " said Yankees owner Colonel Ruppert , " last year you earned more money than President Hoover . " H ? , " Ruth replied , " I had a better year than Hoover . " It was in 1946 that Ruth began suf  --  fering severe headaches and hoarse  --  ness in his throat . In November he checked into a hospital when the left side of his face became so swollen he could n't swallow food . Doctors re  --  moved a tumor in his throat but were unable to excise the source of the growth , lodged in the air passage be  --  hind his nose . Ruth apparently never knew he had cancer . Bob Considine , who helped Ruth write his autobiog  --  raphy , said , " It was d ? hard to work with a man who was dying , dying as resentfully as Babe was . " Ruth 's bitterness stemmed from his years of retirement . The occasional cheers at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his 20-year career , and he was frantic for something to do . After a series of misguided ventures , including a stint as a wrestling referee , Ruth tried to get a job  --  any job  --  with the Yankees a couple of months before he became ill . His old team turned him down . Just after his major surgery he jumped at the opportunity that spring to promote baseball leagues on a na  --  tional tour and logged 50,000 miles . That summer , despite a painful re  --  lapse , he gladly appeared to accept several awards around the country . At the same time , he grew weaker and his voice more gravelly . On June 13 , 1948 , Ruth returned to Yankee Stadium to celebrate the 25th anniver  --  sary of " The House That Ruth Built . " To thunderous cheers , the drawn , white-haired idol walked slowly from continued on page 106 Cancer Prevention continued from page 54 weaker linkage to smoking than oth  --  ers . But I think that the overwhelm  --  ing predominance of lung-cancer cases that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. S : I think it was the EPA that suggested we might prevent " 15,000 to 18,000 cases of lung cancer a year if we could control radon levels . Dr. B : You might . The other advice we would give to somebody living in a radon zone is not to smoke . Dr. S : What about the monoclonal antibodies that you mentioned for cancer therapy ? Dr. B : I think that monoclonal antibodies , genetically engineered antibodies and related things , will become very important components of both diagnosis and therapy for the future  --  both alone and also as link  --  age molecules to either certain types of toxins or to certain types of radio  --  active substances . So you can depend on the concept that they will be important parts of medicine , either diagnostically or therapeutically . And I think that they are an interesting innovation , and what many people may not be aware of is that these tools of genetic en  --  gineering allow new generations of antibodies created by taking some  --  thing from one antibody , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  cally engineer it to be attached to an  --  other kind of backbone . So you have a molecule that essentially is geneti  --  cally engineered and stitches together two different disparate kinds of activ  --  ities so we have chimeric molecules . Many words in medicine have Greek roots . The " chimera " was a mytho  --  logical monster with parts of several animals : a lion 's head , a goat 's body , etc . We 've done similar creative de  --  signing in our genetic engineering . But anyway , the point I 'm raising is that we have chimeric molecules where you take something from a mouse and you may link it to a human " backbone " and create chimeric molecules . For example , in AIDS , where we took the CD4 receptor which binds to the virus and engi  --  neered it so that it 's on a human im  --  munoglobulin backbone , we created the genetically engineered neutralizing antibody . That kind of technology is going to become more and more com  --  mon , and what I call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more common . People will be able to create and synthesize antibodies using the tools of genetic engineering that allow a mixing and matching much as one might put on a wardrobe . * ? We asked Dr. Broder to expand on his earlier remarks about breast can  --  cer . He suggested that at some time in the future it might be time to do double-blind studies to determine whether an estrogen blocker might prevent some high-risk women from developing breast cancer . ( Women who have two relatives with breast cancer are considered to be at high risk . ) In the July/Aug. issue we will discuss this in Part II of our interview with Dr. Broder. ( continued next issue ) That-a- Way continued from page 16 the dugout to home plate , using a bat as a cane . His wife said he cried that night and most of the next day . Ten days later Ruth was admitted to Memorial Hospital . He asked why he had been taken to a cancer hospital , and doctors convinced him that other patients were treated there as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a priest administered the last rites . But five days later he showed up at the pre  --  miere of a movie , The Babe Ruth Story . He was supported on both arms and was so weak that he had to leave halfway through the film . On August 12 the story of Ruth 's condition  --  which had been followed regularly in the press for a year and a half  --  moved to the front page with the announcement that the ballplayer was critically ill . Medical updates were released three times a day , and hundreds stood vigil outside the East Side hospital , including dozens of children who were n't even old enough to have seen their idol play ball . Taxi drivers would stop in front of the hos  --  pital and run inside to get the latest word . More than 15,000 messages and telegrams poured in . Many were from people Ruth had visited when they were in the hospital , like 17-year  --  old Margie Reardon of Paterson , New Jersey , who wrote , " Dear Babe , you told me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll do the same thing . You are in all our prayers . " On the morning of August 16 , Ruth , who had grown less bitter and more resigned , told one visitor , " Do n't come back tomorrow . I wo n't be here . " That evening , at 6:45 , he suddenly got up out of bed and started to walk across the room . The doctor led him back to bed and asked , " Where are you going , Babe ? " Ruth replied , " I 'm going over the valley . " At 7:30 , he fell into a coma , and a half hour later he died . An estimated 77,000 people passed by his closed coffin at Yankee Sta  --  dium . A few days later 75,000 lined Fifth Avenue in the rain for his funeral at St. Patrick 's Cathedral , and another 100,000 watched the pro  --  cession to Westchester County , where the Babe was buried in Gates of Heaven Cemetery . A Her Son continued from page 28 Mrs. Quayle believes . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " You have to take it and go on . " And the flap over Dan 's grades ? " I always felt Danny 's grades were good , " she says . " Things came rela  --  tively easy for him . " And about the National Guard ? " The thing about it was , it was a non-story , " she says . " They the media blew it out of proportion . They made far too much over it . " And , she adds , her husband would n't let Dan or any  --  one else escape the draft . But that was 20 years ago , and now an exciting future lies ahead . Dan likes his new role , she says : " He relates well to people and communi  --  cates well . In getting along with peo  --  ple , he 's A-1 . " While growing up , Dan was ex  --  tremely active , she recalls : " If he was in the house very long he would say , ' Let 's fish or play golf . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to stay inside , he preferred reading the newspaper to listening to records or watching television . He 's like her husband , Jim  --  he 's full of nervous energy , and he inherited his father 's likability . " He 's someone you like . People gravitate toward him , " she says . She remembers Dan having a car  --  ing attitude even when he was a child  --  how at age eight he pitched in and helped while his father was ill and at age ten what a great aid he was when the twins were born . Mrs. Quayle views Dan 's vice presi  --  dency as a gift because he has such qualities . " It 's a gift to the country , " she says . " I really feel that way . " Jane Seymour continued from page 43 miniseries . She languished for a while in such potboilers as Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders , until her star quality began to glisten . The actress was nominated for her first Emmy for her role in the 1976 TV special Captains and the Kings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1981 TV version of John Steinbeck 's East of Eden , in which she portrayed Kate , the venomous brothel owner . " Kate haunted me totally , " Sey  --  mour says . " 1 really began to feel 1 was her , and it took me weeks to get out of her . I had her anger inside of me . It 's not a part I 'd like to play every day of the year , as it could destroy my life . " Then came her roles as Heming  --  way 's Lady Brett Ashley in The Sun Also Rises and identical twins ( one psychotic ) in Dark Mirror , followed by Crossings and her more recent suc  --  cesses in 1988 . When asked how many miniseries she has been in , she is genuinely stumped but thinks " around 17 . " What is it about this intense English actress that makes her come alive in front of the TV camera ? Seymour leans forward on the patio table and folds her hands . Her arms are delicate . " I 'm fortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instru  --  ment that loves me . I 'm definitely not the prettiest or most beautiful person in the world . One smitten cinemato  --  grapher has disagreed : " Wow  --  if Bo Derek 's a 10 , this lady 's a 101/2 . ' There are so many women who are more spectacular looking . But the camera does find things . If I do nothing , if I do n't move my face , if I just think about something , the camera picks it up and broadcasts it loud and clear . The camera sucks these things out of me . " One reviewer who had seen her as the evil Kate in East of Eden said : " She was terrifying . I do n't care how pleasant she is in real life ; she must have found something awful inside of her to play from . " " I have a lot of people inside me , " she acknowledges , " and am so                    @
