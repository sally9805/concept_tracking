Rod and Ronald Reagan 's old Iowa neighbors have been quietly at work this summer putting together some more good luck to hand to the President in the fall . Unless there is unprecedented capriciousness on the part of nature in the next few days , the heavy ears of corn will mature by the trillions . They will either set a new record for yield , more than 127 bu. per acre , or come so close it hardly matters . And the soybeans , with almost human cunning , are making quite a show of their last 6 in. of growth . Forecasters expect them to disgorge a torrent of protein and set their own record , more than 39 bu. per acre . <P> In the gently rolling land of Adair County , which helped nurture the great agriculturists of the Wallace family ( Henry A. was Secretary of Agriculture for F.D.R. ) , some of the farmers already have had three cuttings of hay , and they may get a fourth . Two cuttings used to be considered profligate abundance . While the Soviets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil and a crippling social system-and while their Polish subjects line up at the doors of half-empty food markets-the U.S. in its summer idyll barely notices its own miracle of weather , machines and people that makes all else possible . <P> This season in Adair County has been a ballet of breathtaking intricacy , timing and beauty . In late May and early June , when the plowed land lay naked and vulnerable , there were no pelting rains to rip out seed and carry off precious topsoil . Then , every week with uncanny regularity , gentle showers brushed the new shoots . The temperature never went over 100 F , and every evening cool air formed in the swales and spread protectively over the young plants . The moisture choked the grasshopper hatch . Tornadoes and hail , which can claw the land raw in seconds , never materialized . Out of 25 summer thunderstorms , only one was manly enough to ruffle the oats and alfalfa of Adair County . <P> If God ordered it done , then surely he assigned the spirit of Iowa 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The palette was filled with greens , from the dark of soybeans to the lighter grasslands , and the fields were etched by deep shadows and white gravel roads . Their borders were sprinkled with wild roses and ring-necked pheasants whose vivid fall plumage is just beginning to erupt . The dense stands of hybrid corn , with stalks 10-ft. high , are so well nourished with fertilizers that they look like flawless cut carpet laid meticulously from fence to fence . Not in local memories , which go back nearly 80 years , is there such a picture of natural harmony . <P> Yet even in Adair County , Iowa , with the struggles over the MX missile and stock market jitters only muffled sounds on a far , bright horizon , there is the shadow of troubles ahead . Those fields that now are offering up such bounty are so intensively farmed , in their owners ' mad race against high costs , that the topsoil is washing away at an alarming rate . When the Adair prairies were broken some 150 years ago , the topsoil was 12-to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And from a small plane in those glistening skies the fields show telltale fingers of light green to yellow , where the loam has cascaded down the gullies and ditches and headed off to the Gulf of Mexico .
