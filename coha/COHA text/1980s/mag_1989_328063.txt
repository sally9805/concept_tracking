Ever since he was brought by Mikhail Gorbachev into the Soviet Politburo in December 1985 , no Soviet political figure has been as irreverently outspoken about Soviet life or as ambitious to change it as Boris Yeltsin , 58 , a heavyset , 6-ft. 2-in. man from Sverdlovsk in the Ural Mountains . Appointed to clean up the corrupt Moscow party committee , he quickly fired hundreds of bureaucrats and barnstormed the city , criticizing food shortages and general incompetence . But his reforming zeal and a bitter public debate with Politburo conservative Yegor Ligachev led to his public censure and ouster from the Moscow party position in November 1987 . <P> But Yeltsin has refused to disappear . Banished to a deputy-ministry position in the construction industry , he is now attempting the unheard-of in Soviet life : a political comeback . Widely popular on the streets of Moscow , Yeltsin has got himself chosen as one of two candidates in the March 26 nationwide runoff for the brand-new Congress of People 's Deputies . Today he campaigns daily around the city , exciting cheering crowds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frenzy of his quest and granted an interview in his Moscow office with TIME Washington correspondent David Aikman . <P> Q. You are running for election in the Moscow district as if your life depended on it . Why does winning it mean so much to you ? <P> A. My candidacy was proposed by several hundred organizations in 50 different constituencies around the Soviet Union . But the Moscow constituency is the Moscow constituency . An elected representative will find it easier to deal with issues if he has been elected by this particular constituency , constituency No. 1 in Moscow . <P> And during the dramatic events of the fall of 1987 , I was accused of not being acceptable to Muscovites . I think it is now objectively possible to find out whether this is the case . <P> Q. Why is this so important to you ? <P> A. Why ? If you were mugged on the street and robbed of your jacket , it would also be important to you that your robber was identified and captured . <P> Q. If you get elected as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <P> A. It will be one thing if I am just a representative at the Congress and quite another if I am in the permanent Supreme Soviet as a sort of professional politician  --  to use your vocabulary , though we do n't have such terminology  --  in which case my functions will be different and ought to be looked at differently . As to actually becoming a member of the Supreme Soviet , I do n't rate my chances very high . <P> Q. Why not ? <P> A. As I see it , the people who make the proposals are not very enthusiastic about it . <P> Q. Who , for example ? <P> A. The political leadership . <P> Q. Why is the political leadership opposed to you ? <P> A. You ca n't explicitly call it opposition . I give full support to the general direction of perestroika , to the country 's foreign policy and so on . But I have my own views on matters of political tactics that differ slightly from , the position of the official leadership . In this respect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I insist on certain limits to it . <P> Q. Should the President of the Soviet Union be chosen by a direct , popular vote ?
