Other factors may have been instrumental in Mr. Koch ' s defeat . But neither David N. Dinkins , the Democratic nominee , nor Rudolph W. Giuliani , his Republican-Liberal rival , is taking any chances . Both indicate they would defer even their promises to increase the size of the police force rather than raise taxes , though they imply that a tax increase would be preferable to compromising public safety . " See , it ' s one thing to add cops , " Mr. Dinkins said . " It ' s quite another to reduce the number we have. " // If his administration tries for six months or a year to improve police efficiency but the crime rate rises , Mr. Giuliani said : " You ' re going to need more and you can ' t cut . And then , if you have to , you raise taxes in order to accomplish that goal . " <> <> Admitted Delays Probable // In separate interviews , the two candidates outlined their spending priorities as mayor - some of which , they acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget deficits. // The painful search for places to cut spending seemed to lead to an inconsistency by Mr. Giuliani . This week , he ridiculed Mr. Dinkins ' s proposal for a 1 percent across-the-board budget cut , except in the Police Department. // " What this city needs is a mayor , not a formula , " Mr. Giuliani said at that time. // But in the interview , which was conducted earlier , Mr. Giuliani cited potential savings from improved productivity , from a hiring freeze and from other economies that he detailed , and then he added : " After you ' ve gone through that process , to close the gap you impose an across-the-board decrease of a percent , half a percent , a quarter of a percent - whatever ' s needed to do it , on each one of the agencies that you believe are nonessential and you let your commissioners work out how to accomplish that. " // Explaining the apparent inconsistency , Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Dinkins had seemed in a television interview to be relying solely on an across-the-board cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings and said he was prepared " to see where else we have to cut " beyond the 1 percent. // The Koch administration , its budget director , Paul Dickstein , said yesterday , has surgically cut spending when necessary but has never imposed across-the-board cuts. // Mr. Dinkins , as Manhattan Borough President , has had modest administrative experience in city government ; Mr. Giuliani , a former Federal prosecutor in Manhattan , has had none . <> <> Balancing a Budget // Mr. Dinkins acknowledged that " people have expressed their concern with whether or not I recognize the need to balance a budget , " but he said his appointment of fiscal moderates as his economic advisers and of Nathan Leventhal , a former deputy mayor under Mr. Koch , to handle the transition between administrations " suggests the people , the quality of the persons " he would recruit for his cabinet and his commitment to a balanced budget. // Mr. Giuliani said he preferred to be measured by his performance in previous public offices . " Candidates for public office have track records , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to ask is ' Have they distinguished themselves and risen to the top in the things they ' ve done in the past , or have they been mediocre , lackluster and have they failed in things they ' ve done in the past ? ' " <> <> Signal to Business // Both candidates said bridging projected budget gaps , along with reducing crime , were among their top priorities . Mr. Giuliani said another would be to restore " the sense of hope and a can-do attitude to New York. " // Both agreed that any tax increase would send a dangerous signal to the city ' s businesses. // " I don ' t want some corporate soul to read ' Dinkins contemplates taxes , ' " Mr. Dinkins said when asked under what circumstances he would raise them. // " The very last , " Mr. Giuliani replied to the same question. // Neither candidate would specify which taxes he would resort to , if necessary , though Mr. Giuliani said he would begin with " the easy ones , " which he defined as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on income , sales or property. // Both said they were leaning away from a so-called dedicated tax whose revenues would be reserved to pay for more police officers. // Mr. Dinkins said taxpayers might be willing to support such a " revenue enhancement. " // Mr. Giuliani proposed that a portion of the state capital gains tax be earmarked to subsidize mass transit . Otherwise , he said he generally opposed taxes set aside for specific purposes . And he said raising taxes undermines an opportunity that austerity presents. // " If what you say to all your commmissioners is , ' I ' m going to get you out of a hole by raising taxes , don ' t worry about it , ' they don ' t go through the discipline of really analyzing what ' s there , what can be cut , how can we make it more productive ? " Mr. Giuliani said. // Projected deficits , he said , represent " an opportunity to reform , restructure , analyze our government better , make it more productive , and also , if you understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to be more reasonable about the demands they would make on the government. " // New York City is facing a combined budget gap of more than $1 billion in the current fiscal year and the next one , beginning July 1 , 1990 . Last week , Mr. Koch proposed selective cutbacks and taxes to meet this year ' s projected deficit but retained his plan to increase the police force. // The current deficit was swollen by $247 million that the city had anticipated from the sale to a developer of the New York Coliseum site at Columbus Circle . The sale was blocked by several lawsuits supported by , among others , three West Side legislators who are allies of Mr. Dinkins , whose reputation as a conciliator could be enhanced if he persuades them to withdraw. // Neither candidate would identify a specific agency or program that he would eliminate . Rather , each suggested that the government , including its program to rebuild public works , could be run more efficiently. // Mr. Giuliani said he would exempt the police force , firefighters and child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare the police. //
