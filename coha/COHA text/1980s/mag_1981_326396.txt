A TIME poll confirms a conservative swing-with some big qualifications <P> A new American consensus is in the making . And , yes , it is conservative , as everyone has long suspected . But it is not the lockstep ideology of the Moral Majority and other far-right zealots , and in many details the consensus differs from the social vision of Ronald Reagan , a President whose popularity rating seems to be on the rise . By and large , the American people are indeed fed up with what they see as an invasion by government and the courts into their private lives . They are worried about the moral standards of the television programs seen by their children . But at the same time , a majority of the U.S. public favors the Equal Rights Amendment , opposes making abortions illegal and is strongly in favor of gun control . Perhaps most important , there is a fresh sense of optimism about the way things are going in the country . <P> These are among the findings of a major national opinion survey conducted for TIME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Inc. , from May 12 through May 14. * The poll contained pleasant news for Reagan . His rating " as a leader you can trust " is virtually the same as Jimmy Carter 's was at the same month of 1977 . One key difference is that Reagan 's level of approval has risen 9% since January ( to 57% ) , while Carter 's rating was on a downward slide . Majorities ranging from 71% to 52% agreed with the propositions that Reagan had lived up to his campaign promises in six key areas : working effectively with Congress , providing strong leadership in government , providing moral leadership , keeping U.S. defenses strong , getting rid of waste in government and making Americans feel good again . <P> Reagan is also given high marks on his handling of foreign affairs with 76% expressing some degree of confidence in him . Nonetheless a near majority opposes his decision to send military advisers to El Salvador ( 47% to 35% ) . The public favors reopening strategic arms talks with the Soviet Union ( 65% to 25% ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by opposing ( 67% to 23% ) economic and military aid for anti-Communist allies like South Korea if they violate human rights . <P> At least as remarkable as the level of his own popularity is the change in the national mood that has come with Reagan 's early months in the White House . In the first week of January , only 26% of Americans polled by Yankelovich felt that things were going well in the country . That figure has now nearly doubled to 51% , marking the first time since October 1978 that a majority has felt so positive . There has also been a dramatic turn in expectations about inflation . In April 1979 only 9% of the country believed that inflation would be curtailed under Carter . Now , 45% say price rises will be controlled . <P> While 82% of the voters expressed varying degrees of confidence in Reagan 's handling of the economy , there is no great support for his proposed three-year tax cut scheme . Only 32% of those questioned favored that proposal , while 36% wanted no more than a one-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time . There is also widespread skepticism about the equity of Reagan 's budget cuts : 71% believe that some people-primarily the poor and the elderly-will be hurt more than others .
