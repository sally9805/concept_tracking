Because surveys taken by the state Republican Party show him to enjoy broad voter acceptance , Mr. Kean has been stumping the state , cutting ribbons at the opening of campaign headquarters , and - in a sign of the state Republicans ' new affluence - appearing in television commercials in an off- year election. // The G.O.P. is outspending the Democrats , who now hold slim margins in both the Senate and Assembly , by more than 4 to 1 , and has targeted three Senate races as vital to its plans for upsetting the Democratic edge of 21 to 19 in the upper house. // The lack of a statewide issue this year has encouraged the Republican Party to put the Governor center stage , hoping that his reported 75 percent acceptance rate by voters will help swing some close contests . In his commercials Mr. Kean appeals to voters to send him more help - that is , Republican legislators - for the last two years of his current term. // // Senate President a Target One of the candidates who is counting on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of the Republican Legislative Campaign Committee , is Ralph J. Salerno , a lawyer from Bloomfield . Mr. Salerno is making his first try for elective office in a bid to unseat the New Jersey Senate President , Carmen A. Orechio , Democrat of Nutley. // The Salerno campaign has already spent $110 , 000 , most of it from the state campaign committee . Mr. Orechio has spent $87 , 000. // The three campaigns targeted by the Republicans have turned " negative " in the closing stages , Mr. Murray said . In each race , the candidates are attacking the incumbent Democrats , often in personal terms , while trying to establish the credentials of the Republican challengers. // In the 30th Legislative District in suburban Essex County , Mr. Salerno appears to be campaigning against the Orechio family as well as the Senate President . <> <> Water Commission Jobs Cited // He charges that Mr. Orechio controls appointments to the North Jersey District Water Supply Commission and that the family has made the agency a fiefdom . Carl Orechio , the Senator ' s brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frank Orechio , another brother , receives $54 , 000 as a program director for the Wanaque South Water Project. // Mr. Orechio , who is also the Mayor of Nutley , calls the attacks " sleazy " and has refused to appear on a campaign platform with his opponent until he gets an apology . " He ' s not running against my brothers , he ' s running against me , " he said. // Mr. Orechio said appointments to the commission are made by the Governor . The appointments , however , must be confirmed by the Senate. // The Senate President is not surprised that he has been targeted . The 30th is a swing district - his brother Carl served 10 years in the State Assembly as a Republican - and he won re-election in 1981 by only slightly more than 1 , 000 votes . However , Mr. Kean carried the district by more than 3 , 000 votes that year .

Scaturo of Bloomfield , an independent , is also running for the Senate seat. // In the 36th District , Senator Joseph Hirkala , Democrat of Passaic and the Senate majority leader , is being challenged by Joseph F. Job , a Republican , who served 15 years as Bergen County sheriff. // The campaign between the two old friends has turned bitter , with Mr. Job charging that Mr. Hirkala is a part- time " do nothing " official , and Mr. Hirkala attacking Mr. Job ' s performance as sheriff. // The difference money can make in a campaign is evident in this race . Mr. Hirkala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most of it from the State Democratic Committee , is sticking to his familiar personal style of campaigning , which includes giving out mirrors , combs and nail files. // Mr. Job , who first declined help from the Republican campaign committee , has now accepted it and said he has been promised " whatever it takes " in financial help to win . Both men are using radio commercials . Mr. Hirkala ' s commercials highlight Mr. Job ' s penchant for switching parties . He has run as both a Republican and Democrat. // The crossing of party lines - Mr. Job was a Democrat for the last decade until he rejoined the Republicans in time to oppose Mr. Hirkala this year - has had an unusual effect on the campaign . Mr. Job served as campaign chairman four years ago for the district ' s two Democratic Assemblymen , Robert P. Hollenbeck and Richard F. Visotcky , and this year is running with the Republican candidates , Richard De Lauro and Alfred L. Genton , against the two incumbents . <> <> Middlesex Incumbent Targeted // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18th District in Middlesex County where Mayor Peter P. Garibaldi of Monroe Township is trying to reverse his election defeat two years ago by Senator James W. Bornheimer , Democrat of East Brunswick. // Although the Legislature and Governor Kean recently completed enactment of a new auto insurance program designed to hold down rate increases starting next year , Mr. Garibaldi said dissatisfaction with high premiums is still an issue in the race. // He also cited voters ' concerns about property revaluation programs that have had the effect of shifting local property-tax burdens from commercial to residential property owners . The programs are being conducted in several towns , including Mr. Bornheimer ' s hometown , East Brunswick. // A similar revaluation has begun in Monroe Township , but Mr. Garibaldi said he has gone to court to stop it after a disagreement with the concern hired to conduct the survey. // Also running in the Senate race in the 18th District is Robert S. Maurer of Edison , an independent. // //                  @ @ @
