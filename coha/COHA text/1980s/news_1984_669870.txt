LONDON  --  A small Eurobond firm here has filed a claim against Bear , Stearns &; Co. , a New York-based securities concern whose former chief London bond dealer is accused in Switzerland of making fraudulent transactions . T. Galgey &; Co. is seeking the equivalent of about $325 , 000 , at current exchange rates , that the company claims it lost when Bear Stearns refused to honor trades that had been negotiated by Peter Buer , its former dealer . The claim was made through a Zurich-based bond dealers association that settles member disputes through arbitration . It isn ' t certain whether other concerns will make similar claims against Bear Stearns . Mr. Buer , 36 , was fired June 13 for exceeding his trading limits . The Galgey action highlights the difficulties that Bear Stearns may have in trying to cancel some of the transactions made by Mr. Buer and others . Bear Stearns previously said it would honor all legitimate trades . But the concern also said 23 transactions are " patently suspect " and won ' t be completed . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern , on the ground that transactions in the unregulated Euromarket are made between firms , not individuals . The Eurobond scandal surfaced two weeks ago when Jurg Remund , 35 , the chief New York bond dealer of UBS Securities Inc. , a unit of Union Bank of Switzerland , committed suicide in Zurich , according to Swiss police . He had been ordered back to Switzerland by UBS to face possible prosecution over alleged trading irregularities with Mr. Buer . Last week , Mr. Buer was arrested at Geneva airport . He faces prosecution under Swiss law on fraud charges stemming from the scandal . In a statement yesterday , Terry Galgey , head of Galgey , said that his company is pursuing action against Bear Stearns through the Association of International Bond Dealers , a self-regulatory body with 700 firms as voluntary members . Mr. Galgey said he notified both the association and Bear Stearns late Monday of the action . A spokesman for Bear Stearns declined to comment on Galgey ' s action . Under the association ' s procedures , unresolved disputes between member firms are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a principal of a concern that dealt with Mr. Buer , commented on Mr. Buer ' s recent trading activities . Maurice Berger , a principal at Obli Trading S.A. , said that Mr. Buer in recent months favored " straddles , " a practice that permitted him to trade bonds against positions taken in shares or options . Profits can be made on straddles through price-differences in the various securities . " We understood that he had a share position in his bonds , " said Mr. Berger , " that he was turning the bonds and the shares together  --  but we didn ' t know anything more . " Obli , a small Swiss dealer , isn ' t accused of any wrongdoing in the alleged fraud . None of Obli ' s dealings with Mr. Buer at Bear Stearns , dating back to last year , is being disputed . The Swiss firm didn ' t conduct any business with Mr. Buer over the past 2 1/2 months , said Mr. Berger . According to Bear Stearns and others , the allegedly fraudulent trades were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he ( Mr. Buer ) spoke to us to make a trade and the price didn ' t conform to the market price at the moment , he confirmed to us that he had a position in shares against his bonds , he had positions in options against his bonds  --  what we call straddles , " Mr. Berger said . Most Eurobond trades among dealers are negotiated over the telephone or telex and settled through one of two competing clearinghouses , Euroclear and Cedel . In the case of many of Mr. Buer ' s transactions , instructions to complete trades were never sent , according to concerns that dealt with Mr. Buer . Mr. Berger said that the bond dealers association ' s code of conduct states that trades between member firms at nonmarket prices should be confirmed by telex . Another London trader , who declined to be identified , but who dealt with Mr. Buer , said the former Bear Stearns dealer bought bonds and lent them overnight to other firms while dealing in the shares of the same underlying securities . This proved to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock and bond prices recently tumbled , both Mr. Buer and his firm were left with severe paper losses , according to the trader .
