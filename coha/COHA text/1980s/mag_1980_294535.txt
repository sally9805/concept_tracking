Around Boeing 's spartan hangar-like headquarters in Seattle , they call him the " old shoe , " and Thornton Arnold ( " T " ) Wilson , 59 , certainly is that . Eight years ago , when he became chairman of the board , he did not bother moving out of his noisy office to more elegant surroundings down the hall . Each morning he sheds his suit jacket and conducts business in a navy blue sweater . When the temperature gets too cold , he can even be seen working in his hat and overcoat . And despite a yearly income in the million-dollar range , Wilson still lives in the same house he bought 30 years ago and drives himself to work in a Honda Accord . Behind the folksy down-home style , though , is a tough , raw-hewn engineer . On his office wall hangs a laminated olive branch , a peace offering from a group of squabbling managers who once exasperated their chairman . When they could not reach a consensus at a meeting , Wilson slammed his folder shut and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had something to talk about . From the time he was in high school in Jefferson City , Mo. , Wilson knew he wanted to sell airplanes . Even then , he had the knack for dramatizing issues . He once led a strike by high school students to get a new playground . As the school board was deliberating its decision , Wilson had the school band oom-pah-pah-ing under its windows . He got the playground . He graduated in 1943 with a degree in aeronautical engineering from Iowa State University , where he was captain of the swimming team and a champion at high jinks . On the way home from a meet , he picked up a lady 's underpants and stuffed them into his coach 's suitcase . <P> While in college , Wilson planned to join the Army Air Corps , but in his senior year he broke his foot tobogganing.
