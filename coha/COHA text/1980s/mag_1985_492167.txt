ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS CELEBRATES ITS 50th YEAR Fifty years ago this summer two men managed to cast off the chains of their alcohol addiction . The fellowship they founded has saved the lives of millions . by Baz Edrneades The March 1 , 1941 , Saturday Evening Post ( adorned with an appealing Norman Rockwell cover and costing five cents ) is a historic issue . It contains a Jack Alexander story that turned Alcoholics Anonymous , an obscure self-help organization , into an American institution . AA 's growth has not leveled off in the intervening years . The fellowship now has more than one million members , and its message of spiritual renewal is felt world-wide . This July in Montreal , Canada , some 50,000 people from around the world will meet to celebrate AA 's 50th birthday . They will gather without hoopla or hype , for AA has a firm policy against promotion . The meeting , nonetheless , will be one of celebration , an expression of " sheer joy " by recovered alcoholics and their families . Among the honored guests will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alcoholics Anonymous would never have been founded . This is their incredible story : Alcoholics Anonymous was founded in 1935 after a New York stockbroker , William Griffith Wilson , met a fellow alcoholic , Dr. Robert Holbrook Smith , in Akron , Ohio . The fellowship is reckoned to have started on June 10 of that year , the day that Dr. Smith took his last drink , a beer accompanied by a tranquilizer . Dr. Smith needed to steady his nerves  --  he was about to perform an operation . The whole story starts a few years earlier . A pebble from the Alps had started the avalanche of recovery that was to become Alcoholics Anonymous . In 1931 the Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung was treating an American named Rowland H. for a drinking problem . No sooner had therapy ended , however , than Rowland lapsed back into drunkenness . Refusing to take him back as a pa-tient , Jung told Rowland bluntly that further psychiatric measures were pointless . His only hope of recovery , said Jung , lay in a " vital " spiritual experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sobriety  --  with the Oxford Group , an evangelistic organization founded by a Lutheran minister , Dr. Frank Buchman . Rowland shared Jung 's message , and his own experience , with other problem drinkers whom he met through the group . As a result of Rowland 's efforts , at least one member , Ebby T. , was able to stop drinking for a time . Near the end of 1934 , Ebby , then about six months sober , went to Brooklyn to see his old friend Bill Wilson , who had fallen upon hard times . Bill , a tall , good-looking man , had been one of the first , and best , security analysts on the New York Stock Exchange . He had conceived the notion that investors would do well to take a closer look at the businesses whose stocks they were buying . He and his wife , Lois , had quit their jobs and taken to the road to do just that . His breakthrough was to discover the great investment potential of the General Electric Company at the advent of radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The crash of 1929 hurt Bill , but he made no less than two financial recoveries in the early ' 30s . Alcohol ( in the heart of Prohibition ! ) finally reduced him to poverty . A friend remembered how things were during this period : " Nearly half a century has passed , but I can still see Bill coming into Ye Olde Illegal Bar on a freezing afternoon with a slow stride  --  he never hurried  --  and looking over with lofty dignity at the stack of bottles back of the bar , containing those rare imported beverages straight off the liner from Hoboken . One time at Whitehall subway station , not far from Busto 's a speak-easy he took a tumble down the steps . The old brown hat stayed on ; but , wrapped up in that long overcoat , he looked like a collapsed sailboat on the subway platform . I recall how his face lit up when he fished out of the heap of clothes an unbroken bottle of gin , " he reminisced . At the time of Ebby 's visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor suspected brain damage . For Bill , self-hate was the daily companion to the terror that he and Lois felt . Ebby , on the otherhand , looked and felt good . Rather hesitantly , he explained how he had stopped drinking . He did n't really expect to get through , but as Bill was to confess later , " In no waking moment could I get that man or his message out of my head . " Bill continued , however , to drink . A month later , he was back in Charles B. Towns hospital , an alcoholic rehabilitation center , for the fourth time . Ebby paid him another visit there . Billasked him to repeat the " neat little formula " that had enabled him to stop drinking ; Ebby did so " in perfectly good humor . " The process involved admitting that you were beaten , getting honest with yourself , talking it out with somebody else , making restitution to the people you had harmed and praying to your own conception of a God . Bill was , to say the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he was in the grip of a terrible depression  --  his pride could no longer hold out against the danger and disgrace drinking had brought upon him . Suddenly he found himself prepared to do " anything , anything at all . " Without faith or hope he cried , " If there be a God , let Him show Himself ! " Then came the event that would change everything . " Suddenly the room lit up with a great white light . I was caught up in an ecstasy that there are no words to describe . It seemed to me , in the mind 's eye , that I was on a mountain and that a wind not of air but of spirit was blowing . And then it burst upon me that I was a free man . " In later years Bill was to downplay this event . With cheerful iconoclasm , he would refer to it as his " hot flash " experience . He insisted that his real battle with ignorance and arrogance lay ahead . But he never took another drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his " hot flash " might have been nothing more than a hallucination associated with the d.t. ' s . He discussed this fear with the hospital 's chief of staff , Dr. William D. Silkworth . Silkworth , a neurologist , had already introduced Bill to the idea , unorthodox at the time , that alcoholism was a disease rather than a moral weakness . Now he affirmed that Bill had undergone " some great psychic occurrence " and advised him to hold on to it . Life began anew for the Wilsons . They attended Oxford Group meetings and lived off the small wages Lois was earning as a salesclerk in a Brooklyn department store . Bill yearned to become the family 's breadwinner once again , but he had always been the slave of his own enthusiasm . Caught up in something , he would give it all his considerable energies . Now Bill was consumed by the idea of a movement of recovered alcoholics who would help their still-suffering fellows . He was convinced the message from Dr. Silkworth and from Ebby T. could work for other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective . Ebby knew the hopelessness and blindness of alcoholism from the inside ; surely his empathy had enabled him to get through to Bill when nobody else  --  not even Lois  --  could . The first six months of Bill 's sobriety were spent in enthusiastic but fruitless attempts to help other alcoholics . Bill 's approach was almost exclusively spiritual . Finally , Dr. Silkworth , who was permitting him to speak to patients at Towns , suggested bluntly that he " stop preaching at drunks " and concentrate on the medical facts instead . If an alcoholic could be told by another alcoholic that he had a serious illness , that might do the trick . . . . Bill did not put this advice into practice immediately . A business opportunity intervened . He went to Akron to take part in a proxy voting battle for the control of the National Rubber Machinery Company . The prize would be a position as an officer in the company and a new career . He was , after all , only 39 , and great things still seemed possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and victory appeared to be in Bill 's grasp . Abruptly , however , the tide turned in favor of the opposition . Bill 's past offered them an excellent weapon they did not hesitate to use . The battle was lost . Bill 's associates returned to New York and left him alone in Akron to salvage the situation . It was Friday afternoon , and Bill faced a weekend alone in a strange city . Lonely , and resentful over his defeat , he paced up and down in the lobby of his hotel . At one end of his beat was a bar , where the familiar buzz of a drinking crowd offered comfort and conversation . Bill was gripped by fear . He thought of his work with other alcoholics during the past six months . Unsuccessful as it had been from their point of view , the work had certainly kept him sober . Now he needed another alcoholic as much as that person needed him . He called an Episcopal clergyman listed on the church directory displayed in the lobby and explained his situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , and by Sunday he found himself in the home of a young woman member of the Oxford Group . She wanted him to speak to her friend , Dr. Robert Smith , who had recently confessed to being a drinker . Dr. Smith arrived at five that afternoon with his wife and teen-age son in tow . Hung over , he explained he could only stay 15 minutes . He stayed six hours . Bob Smith 's drinking had been a serious problem since he had been at medical school . The suffering in ? volved in maintaining a facade through the subsequent years had been considerable . Fifty-five years old , he had by all accounts been an excellent doctor . Now , however , his career was in ruins , and his financial position desperate . At the invitation of Bob 's wife , Anne , Bill stayed with the Smiths for the rest of his time in Akron . A month later , Bob took his last drink . Only weeks later Bob and Bill carried the message to another man , Bill D. , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed after he had blackened the eyes of two nurses . Bill D. found permanent sobriety . Through Bob and Bill 's efforts the self-help society began to grow . Bill was the pioneer , the promoter and the organizer , but Bob was unsurpassed at working personally with alcoholics . In the next few years , he would treat thousands without charge ? in addition to rebuilding his career as a surgeon . " It is difficult , " wrote a priest who worked with Bob , " to speak of Dr. Smith without going into eulogistic superlatives . While he lived , he laughed them off , and now , though he is dead , I feel he still continued on page 102 102 THE SRTURDAY EVENING POST July/August 1985 Alcoholics Anonymous continued from page 72 laughs them off . " A classmate from medical school recalls a day near the end of Bob 's life in 1950 . " One of the outstanding incidents of my life is the Sunday we spent with him at his home in Akron . It was something like people coming to Lourdes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One was a dean of a large college in Ohio . Two people who stand out in my memory were a lawyer and his wife . They had driven all the way from Detroit to tell him what he 'd done for them through AA . " Two years after their first meeting , Bill and Bob could count at least 40 sober alcoholics , some of them " very grim , last-gasp cases that had been sober a couple of years . " They realized the chain reaction they had started could spread throughout the world . " What a tremendous realization that was ! " Bill wrote . " At last we were sure . There would be no more flying totally blind . " While Bob continued to build the fellowship in Akron , Bill began writing a book ( Alcoholics Anonymous ; AA members call it " The Big Book " ) about its methods and philosophy . Until then AA 's message had been transmitted exclusively face-to-face . For a while , it seemea that the potent magic of that message had been lost in print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and word-of-mouth continued , however , to spread the news of hope for alcoholics , and before long a steady trickle of orders began coming in . Then Jack Alexander began working on an article about AA for The Saturday Evening Post . Initially prepared to debunk the fellowship , Alexander , after an exhaustive investigation , became an enthusiastic believer . No sooner had his article appeared in the March 1 , 1941 , Post than the group 's small office in New York was swamped with orders for the book and letters asking for assistance . Somehow , the staff ( a young woman , Ruth Hock ) and volunteers ( everybody else ) managed to send a personal reply to each inquiry . Throughout North America ( and indeed , the world ) the Big Book took the place of the personal " sponsorship " that had brought sobriety to pre-1941 members . AA almost burst upon the world too soon . At the time of the Post explosion , it had just begun to develop its unique " corporate poverty " policy  --  without which it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a problem for Bill and Bob from the start . Both had spent their early years of sobriety in straitened circumstances . When AA was three years old , Bill was offered " an office , a decent drawing account and a very healthy slice of the profits " of Towns hospital in exchange for " moving his work " into that institution . Initially he was delighted , but other members of the New York group persuaded him to refuse . ( Today , many AA members work as paid alcoholism counselors  --  but in the fellowship 's formative years salaries might have been too heavy a strain on AA 's all-important tradition of free and voluntary assistance . ) Shortly after deciding to keep his AA work nonprofessional , Bill lost his home . For the next two years he and Lois lived with friends and moved more than 50 times before they could afford their own home . Renouncing personal gain , Bill , however , clung to the idea that AA itself should be liberally funded . He believed that AA should build a chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these aims in mind , he and his associates approached John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , for financial assistance . Rockefeller dispatched an investigator to Akron . The report he received made him a lifelong supporter of the group  --  and a firm believer that money would spoil it . In 1940 , he gave a dinner for AA and invited the leading members of New York 's financial community . At this dinner , he asked his son Nelson to announce that he ( John D. ) was donating only $1,000 and to explain that AA required little more in the way of financial ascontinued on following page July/August 1985 his connection with AA would be short-sighted . This belief lies at the heart of AA 's all-important 12th tradition , which reads : " Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our Traditions , ever reminding us to place principles before personalities , " Appropriately enough , the Akron meeting of Bill Wilson and Bob Smith had its origins in the consulting rooms of Carl Jung , that great believer in synchronicity ? " significant " coincidences . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million people have found sobriety in AA . That any single one of them is staying sober is in itself so unlikely , one must conclude that the lives of each one of those men and women have been the product of synchronicity , or what some might call a miracle . 1t : Baz Edmeades is a Canadian writer with legal training . He became interested in the history and financial structure of Alcoholics Anonymous while researching the law of nonprofit corporations and associations for the province of Alberta , where he lives . Golf Courses sistance . The other guests followed suit  --  one banker sent a check for $10 ! Likewise , some members of the fellowship now began questioning whether they really wanted a well-funded organization with a powerful executive . AA had , after all , been founded on the power and enthusiasm of the individual . While the group debated this issue , the steady growth of the first years was suddenly overtaken by waves of new members in the wake of the Post article . AA began to realize it enjoyed a fabulous amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The issue of funding came to a head when one well-wisher left AA a legacy of $10,000 . After a lively discussion , the group made a unique decision . They would not accept it . " . . At the slightest intimation to the general public from our Trustees that we needed money , we could become immensely rich . Compared to this prospect the $10,000 was not much , but like the alcoholic 's first drink , it would , if taken , inevitably set up a disastrous chain reaction . Where would that land us ? Whoever pays the piper calls the tune , and if the AA foundation obtained moneyfrom outside sources , its Trustees might be tempted to run things without reference to the wishes of AA as a whole . Every alcoholic feeling relieved of responsibility would shrug and say , ' Oh the foundation is wealthy ! Why should I bother ? ' The pressure of that fat treasury would surely tempt the Board to do good with such funds , and so divert AA from its primary purpose . " As the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside contributions . Only members may contribute , and even they are asked not to donate more than $500 per year . So Bill had avoided becoming the president of yet another wealthy New York charitable foundation and became , instead , " the greatest social architect of the century , " in Aldous Huxley 's words . He died in relative obscurity in 1971 . In the last part of his life , he avoided fame as assiduously as he had sought it earlier ; he refused publicity and awards  --  a Time cover portrait , an honorary doctorate from Yale . Bill in particular was no stranger to the lure of fame and wealth , but he had come to believe that seeking personal gain  --  including prestige  --  fromcontinued from page 67 Sherlock Holmes .
