THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart <P> <P> Alexander Woollcott , critic , lecturer , radio raconteur , died in 1943 but he has never passed away . The reason is that his friends Kaufman and Hart renamed him Sheridan Whiteside and painted an indelible portrait of him in his primary colors-venom , egocentricity and gush . Ever since this farce-comedy opened in 1939 , it has induced fits of manic laughter . <P> The present revival at Manhattan 's Circle in the Square Theater is a gutsplitter . An accident immures Whiteside ( Ellis Rabb ) in an upper-middle-class home in a Midwestern backwater town . From his imperial wheelchair he plays an epigrammatic Nero to the hapless inhabitants . He forbids his hosts to use the telephone , tries to sabotage the love affair of his selfless secretary ( Maureen Anderman ) , and makes his nurse rue the day that she first heard of Florence Nightingale . <P> The names Whiteside calls people are intermingled with the " names " who call . " Gertrude Stein " phones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penguins from the South Pole , and " William Beebe " an octopus . Swift visits are paid by " Harpo Marx , " played by Leonard Frey , and " Gertrude Lawrence " - a performance by Carrie Nye that rates 10 on a Richter scale for actressy amorous bitchiness . <P> Only Rabb falters a trifle in making Whiteside more of an imp than a monster . Monty Woolley , who originated the role , was white-bearded and corpulent , a sort of malignant Santa Claus . Rabb reveals a trifle too much of the jolly rather than the Old Nick . - By T.E .
