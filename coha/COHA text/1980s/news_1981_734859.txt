Persia and past the Hindu Hush . stopping only and reluctantly in India . Wide of vision , ferocious in battle . Alexander dreamed of uniting all peoples no matter their beliefs and customs into a single political entity and in his welding of East and West came pretty close . Had Alexander not died at age 32. his never-defeated army might well have trudged through most of the known world . As it was . they left their footprints in the sands of time : Alexander s huge empue crumbled shortly Attu his death . Indeed . the widest swath Alexander cut was into the future and the minds of men . I A Marble bust of Alexander . late Hellenisttc Period suspect that a count of Alexander-related images in ON would bring the Macedonian to the head of the secular contingent , numerically right behind the Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only to his military successes , but to his youth , handsome appearance and reportedly chivalrous behavior toward the inhabitants of pulverized cities . It is said that Julius Caesar put down a biography of Alexander and wept with frustration that though older he had not yet achieved anything noteworthy . Napoleon . whose dreams of empire were almost as colorful. kept in his private chambers a painting of the battle of Gaugamela that finally toppled the Persian King Dann is and the Achaemenid dynasty . The fascination with Alexander extends into our tune . Nicholas Hammond . for instance , recently published a detailed study of Alexander 's military machine complete with diagrams of battle formations ( Noyes Piess. $24 ) . Robin Lane Fox has penned his second Alexancler biography . a magnificently illustrated volume with an appendix of close to 400 ? lithographic:it entries all related to Alexander and all published in this century ( Little , Brown , S24 95 ) . But in the end , the man who claimed descent from Zeus seems to elude the pi-obi/1gs of mere mortals . We can look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book and know where Alexander was . We ca n't look into his mind to comprehend the obsessions and fantasies that took him there . Alexander remains an enigma . But as an exhibition at the National Gallery of Art in Washington amply indicates . we can get reasonably close to Alexander 's era . Titled " The Search for Alexander , - the show charts Alexander 's impact on ancient tot while also offering a more expansive view of Macedonian culture . Altogether there are some 175 examples of metalwork. sculpture . jewelry and terra cotta , of which : ( bout 100 have never been seen outside Greece . The sponsors are the National Bank of Greece and Time Inc. ( whose book subsidiary published the Fox book and which is preparing a four-hour television drama on Alexander to be aired by PBS this spring ) . After closing in Washington April 5. the exhibition moves to Chicago . Boston . San Francisco and New York . Unquestionably . the highlights of the exhibition are several magnificent objects excavated tin ee years ago nom a tomb at Vergma. about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a mountainlike the tomb had not been touched since Alexander 's time . Inside , the archeologist in charge . Alanolis Androidkos. discovered numerous splendidly winked items that wet e clearly fit for a king . On view , for example . is a marvelously chunky gold chest decorated on top with the Macedonian starbilist that . at the time of excavation . contained the bones of a mile probably in his forties at time of death . Exhibited . too , are a pair of gilded bronze gi eaves and a gilded silver bow and arrow case . handsomely embossed with battle scenes . The most spectacular piece . though . IS a gold wreath with bees set into filigree work . Mr. Anclromkos concluded through analysis of artifacts and architecture that he had found the grave of Philip II , Alexander 's ! zither. who was assassinated at age 46 in 3.36 B.C. He le-affirms that attribution in his catalog essay . though the connection with Philip ? to judge by reactions to a similar exhibition held in Thessaloniki last summer ? has not been completely accepted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ w , is the presence of a second set of hones belonging to a woman buried at the same time with another wreath /not in the exhibition ) . Her identity remains a troublesome mystery . Alexander ' s mother . Olympia . by all tepoits a hardy monster who probably engineered Philip 's assassination . outlived him by several years . Another wife was murdered shortly after Ills death and Olympia ? whose benign features grace an exhibited gold medallion  --  was again the prime suspect . Whether it is Philip 's tomb or that of a later monarch buried with his consort , the excavation remains one of the spectacular achievements of modern archeology . One would like to think it was underrated , deserving Philip . battle-worn , blind in one eye , lame in one leg , elegantly trundled off to the afterlife . An able warrior and astute diplomat who united the fractious Greek states . he was hardly the barbarian Demosthenes attacked in his scornful Philippics .

Once Alexander set oft to conquer Persia , Greece never saw him again . The farther he ventured , the larger the world seemed to get . He . too , slowly became larger than life . His gestures , always flamboyant , became hard for conventional nunds to grasp . At a single ceremony in Persia . for example . he married 10,000 of his soldiers to Persian women to assure a union of Europe and Asia . When he also demanded from his Greek troops the deep ceremonial obeisance Darius had received . many of the soldiers , unused to stuck deference . feared Alexander wished to be worsluped as a god . Very likely he did . The National Gallery has filled one elegant room with nothing but portrait busts of Alexander placed beneath panoramic photographs of the places he conquered . In most of these his gaze is turned heavenward with his idealized , slightly fleshy face adorned with windswept locks . One of the most beautiful , dating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original , as many extant busts of Alexander are ) , depicts him as Hellos , the sun god . Certainly Alexander worked as hard as any of his portraitists or later biographers to create a legendary aura . When he left India . for example , he carefully deposited specially fabricated . enormous horse-bits and chariots to show future generations that unusual men had passed that way . In the end this operatic , curiously touching attempt at myth-making proved a much less enduring reminder of his far-flung journey than the examples of Hellenistic art lie had brought with him : Lang after Alexander had matched Into the horizon , artists in the Indian province of Gandhara created strangely beautiful images of Buddha modeled on statues of Greek gods . By the tune Alexander died of malaria . an attack apparently aggravated by heavy drinking , his army had covered some 20. - 090 miles .
