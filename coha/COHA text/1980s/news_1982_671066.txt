When Mr. Sanders proceeded to beat Mr. Paquette by 10 votes , the shock was so great that Mr. Paquette left immediately to spend the rest of his term on vacation , and another local politician said of Mr. Sanders , " He ' s the puppy that caught the car. " // Encouraged by his success last March but frustrated by problems with the car , " the puppy " has now gone after the auto dealership . Seven of the 13 members of the city ' s Board of Aldermen are up for re-election March 2 , and Mr. Sanders , who feels frustrated by opposition from the Democratic-dominated board , has endorsed a challenger in every ward. // He is campaigning door to door , although he himself does not face the voters again until next year , and this old city of 38 , 000 people is at a crossroads between old politics and new . <> <> ' Sort of an " In " Place ' // Mr. Sanders , 40 years old , is an example of the kind of population change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural beauty , he came to the state in 1968 as a political science graduate of the University of Chicago and gravitated into free-lance writing and radical politics , and into Burlington. // " Burlington is sort of an ' in ' place to live - young people have moved here from all over the country , " says former Gov . Philip H. Hoff . He left a Wall Street law firm for the amenities of life and practice here years ago , and in the 1960 ' s became the first popularly elected Democratic Governor in the state ' s history. // The influx of young workers to high-technology and service jobs , the movement of University of Vermont students from dormitories into city neighborhoods , the lowering of the voting age to 18 and the soaring rental and medical costs affecting the aging and the poor all combined to produce new demands , new complaints and a vote of discontent . The city ' s conservative Democratic structure was caught asleep. // " They had been in power a long time and they were lazy , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitation that was occurring in the population . Paquette in many ways was a good Mayor , but he was not a very human-being-oriented Mayor . He built things. " // Mr. Sanders ' s election and the parallel rise of a new political party , the Citizens Party , served notice that some things certainly had changed . But the change does not seem to have advanced since then . Instead , the last year has been a spectacle of confrontation and stalemate between the Mayor and the Aldermen . <> <> Dwells on Social Needs // " We are trying to change , " Mayor Sanders says . " They are trying to preserve . There is a built-in conflict . " A man of aggressive intellect and careless dress , the Mayor lives in a sloppy one-and-a-half-room apartment and dwells on broad social needs , issues alien to the Aldermen . " If you go to any members of the board , " he remarked , " and say , ' What are we going to do about escalating medical costs ? What about the problems of youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts ? ' their response is , ' That ' s not really a function of city government. ' " // He was sitting in his drab , cramped two-room office in the old Georgian city hall , complaining that the office air seemed cold to him , like the Aldermen . When he hired his own secretary - his first act , he said - they dismissed her . And when he tried to appoint new city officials , they rejected them . He was soon allowed the secretary , but the case of his right to make the other appointments is now before the Vermont Supreme Court. // Mayor Sanders talked about the holdover city clerk , whom he said he had suspended for opening his mail . He described the defeat of his attempt to establish a Fair Housing Commission to give tenants more legal rights . And then as noon approached , he rushed away to a Community Council luncheon where he was to speak , along with Aldermen , on the topic " Bickering in City Hall : Is This Government ? " // " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in how to make friends and influence people , " said a Republican alderman , Allen Gear , who had helped defeat the Fair Housing Commission . <> <> ' They ' re Out to Get Him ' // " I don ' t know what happened to the Democrats in the last election , " said Russell Niquette , a Democratic Alderman who is up for re-election . " I can only tell you that it won ' t happen in the next election. " // From her table near the front , Ester Cohen , 70 , a Democrat and former member of the Legislature , watched the head table with knowing eyes . " There ' s real confrontation there , and they ' re out to get him - both the Republicans and the Democrats , " she said . " The Democrats are running scared. " // The question now is which side of the confrontation the voters will sympathize with . " I find that 85 percent of the people think that the Aldermen have been unfair to the Mayor , " said Huck Gutman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door to door in Ward 6 , with the Mayor ' s endorsement. // Joyce Desautels , a Democrat who is a past president of the Aldermen , disagrees . Mayor Sanders ' s candidates will win no more than one of the seven seats up for election , she says . And she seems convinced he will be defeated hiself next year . " It ' ll never happen again , " she said . " He ' s a one-term mayor. " // Leo O ' Connor , chief editorial writer for The Burlington Free Press , which opposed Mr. Sanders editorially , agrees . " I think that he didn ' t measure up to his expectations , " he said . " But one thing that he probably did was to get the Democrats resolved to get their act together , and put him out.
