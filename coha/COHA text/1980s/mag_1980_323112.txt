Assault on Iran 's Anglicans <P> Hardly had the Ayatullah Khomeini taken over Iran last February when Aristo Sayeh , the Anglican vicar in Shiraz , was found with his throat slit . The crime has not been solved . <P> Last summer Muslim authorities seized an Anglican hospital and a school for blind children in Isfahan . Ever since then they have been intimidating churchmen to lead them to a supposedly missing cache of money . <P> One night last October , two gunmen burst into the Isfahan bedroom of Anglican Bishop Hassan Barnaba Dehqani-Tafti and his British-born wife Margaret , spraying them with automatic-pistol fire . Four bullets pierced the pillow near the bishop 's head . Amazingly , he was not hit , though his wife received a bullet in the arm . The bishop , president of the Central Synod which includes all Anglicans in the Middle East , fled to exile in Cyprus . <P> The bishop 's English secretary , Jean Waddell , remained behind , and on May 1 a team of gunmen entered her apartment in search of another Anglican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired two shots into her chest . She is still in serious condition . Only a week later , the bishop 's son Bahrain , 24 , was murdered with shots in the head and chest . <P> Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie has denounced the murder and called upon Iran 's President Abolhassan Banisadr to safeguard the nation 's religious minorities , already officially protected by law . The Koran advocates tolerance for Jews and Christians as " People of the Book " ( in their case the Bible ) . Beyond that , the nation 's new Islamic constitution guarantees freedom for both religions and for Zoroastrianism as well , provided they are practiced " within the law . " ( That means , for example , they can not use wine in ritual because alcohol is banned in Iran . ) Others are guaranteed no freedom of worship at all . <P> Worst off is the biggest religious minority in the country , some 500,000 members of the Bah'i faith , many of whom held important posts under the Shah . Khomeini 's revolutionaries seized all official Bah'i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the House of the Bab in Shiraz , the holiest Bah'i shrine . <P> Bah'is are hated as heretics because they believe that The Promised One-expected by Shi'ite Muslims-has already come in the person of Baha'u'llah , who founded the Bah'i faith in 19th century Persia . But why the attacks on Anglicans ? The church has existed in Iran for 150 years , but the 1,000 native Anglicans are associated with onetime British colonialism and suspected of serving as spies . There is a second reason : " Most of our members are Muslim converts , " Margaret Dehqani-Tafti told a British reporter . " They are trying to drive us out . "
