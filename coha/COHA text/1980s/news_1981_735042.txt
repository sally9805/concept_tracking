Many senior citizens do have their checks sent directly to their banks . There are some banks that have a window for seniors alone , so they need not stand so long . A little privacy would help , too . Checking accounts are good for paying utility bills , etc . But , you still have to tote home cash to pay those who cut your lawn , shovel snow , and do minor repairs . If I had to pay everyone by check , my home would be broken into and my checkbook stolen . That happened to one senior citizen , and the thief bought $500 worth of clothes before the checkbook erns found missing . Lots of repairmen want cash on the line as soon as a job is done .
