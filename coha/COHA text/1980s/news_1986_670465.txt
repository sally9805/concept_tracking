A Chronology of Recent Events in the Archdiocese of Seattle 1 . Decision for an apostolic visitation of Seattle For the past several years , at least since 1978 , the Holy See , through the then Apostolic Delegation , has corresponded with Archbishop Hunthausen on matters related to pastoral practices and the presentation of the church ' s teachings . Through this exchange the Holy See sought the assistance of the Archbishop of Seattle in responding to the high volume of complaints that were sent to Rome by priests , religious and faithful in the archdiocese . The Holy See ' s interest in this matter reflected its responsibility for the well-being of the universal church , as outlined in the Constitution on the Church of the Second Vatican Council . It should be stressed that at no time did the Holy See pursue with Archbishop Hunthausen the criticisms it received on controversial issues , e. g. , nuclear weapons and the payment of taxes . The concerns were strictly and solely of a doctrinal and pastoral nature. // The Archbishop agreed that there were abuses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fairness to Archbishop Hunthausen , he did address some of the problems brought to his attention by the Holy See. // Substantial complaints nevertheless continued . But , the decision to inquire further was primarily provoked by the documented responses of the Archbishop himself . Moreover , in expressing their fraternal concern for Archbishop Hunthausen and the church in Seattle , certain bishops suggested that there was a need " to clear the air . " Prominent among their recommendations was the appointment of a brother bishop to visit Archbishop Hunthausen and the church in Seattle in order to gather factual information on behalf of the Holy See . Accordingly , on July 6 , 1983 , the Most Rev. James A. Hickey , Archbishop of Washington , was named Apostolic Visitator. 2. // Preparation of the apostolic visitation From the beginning the priorities of the Holy See were twofold : to promote the building up of the church in Seattle in harmony with the universal church and to protect the good name of Archbishop Hunthausen . Consequently , it was determined that publicity would be kept to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archbishop . Furthermore , it was the firm intention of the Holy See that any action required would come only after fully informing Archbishop Hunthausen and making every effort to secure his agreement and support. // Before Archbishop Hickey began the apostolic visitation , he consulted with Archbishop Hunthausen both in a long telephone conversation and in a day-and-a-half meeting in Chicago . Both the procedure and the various doctrinal and pastoral aspects were reviewed in detail . Many of those who had lodged complaints against Archbishop Hunthausen had sent him copies of their letters to the Holy See and/or spoke to him personally . Archbishop Hickey discussed these persons with Archbishop Hunthausen and asked for an evaluation of the authenticity of their remarks and their reliability . The visitator also asked Archbishop Hunthausen ' s help in drawing up a list of persons to be questioned . Archbishop Hickey stressed his desire to gain a balanced view of the archdiocesan situation , the positive as well as the negative. // Archbishop Hunthausen insisted that a public announcement be made about the visitation . Once this was done , the statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Archbishop Hunthausen in accord with the initial and constant wish of the Holy See. 3 . <> <> The visitation // Information was gathered from the following sources : // * Public documents such as archdiocesan policy statements on matters dealing with church teaching and discipline. // * The testimony given by those on the list prepared in advance . This was done through consultation with Archbishop Hunthausen and the Rev. Michael Ryan , vicar general of the Archdiocese of Seattle , so that a cross-section of the priests , religious and laity in the archdiocese would be represented . In all , this included 70 individuals , nearly one half of whom were priests of the archdiocese. // * The testimony of the Archbishop himself , a written copy of which he reviewed and signed . It should be noted that the visitator spent 13 hours in conversation with Archbishop Hunthausen . Every effort was made to assess the credibility of the persons who had complained to the Holy See. // Throughout the investigation a number of allegations were judged as insufficiently based in fact or as corrected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful attention was given to the facts verified by the three sources of information noted above , five areas of concern remained : the tribunal , liturgy , clergy formation , priests leaving the ministry or who are laicized , moral issues in health-care institutions and ministry to homosexuals . The testimony of " unfriendly " witnesses added little to the data on which the criticism of the Holy See was based. // In more specific terms the problems included the following : // The Tribunal - The misunderstanding and systematic misapplication of the so-called internal forum solution and the lack of a plan to employ degreed personnel in the Tribunal. // The Liturgy - The widespread use of general absolution on a regular basis and the practice of first communion before first confession ; repeated instances of intercommunion , e. g. , permitting non-Catholics to receive communion at Catholic masses and Catholics in Protestant services. // Health Care - The continued inadequate response in both teaching and practice to the directives of the Holy See and the National Conference of Catholic Bishops regarding contraceptive sterilization in Catholic hospitals. // Homosexuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at once unequivocally based on the teachings of the Magisterium , rather then on erroneous doctrines , and which avoids affiliations with groups promoting doctrines contrary to the church ' s teachings. // Inactive Priests - The employment of those who have left the active ministry and/or who have been laicized , in teaching positions and for service in the liturgy contrary to the directives of the Holy See and the terms of their rescripts of laicization. // Clergy Formation - Because of concern regarding the admissions practices for candidates for the priesthood and because of concern and questions surrounding the continuing formation of the clergy , efforts must be taken to ensure that the continuing education of priests be done in ways that emphasize the bonds of the local church with the universal church , and which are firmly rooted in sound theology , especially in these areas : Christology , anthropology , the role of the Magisterium , the nature of the church and priesthood and moral theology. // After hearing a preliminary report on the visitation , Archbishop Hunthausen concluded that the Holy See judged him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , Archbishop Hunthausen understood that the Holy See considered him lacking the firmness necessary to govern the archdiocese . The Archbishop would dissent from such a judgment , but stated in a letter to the Pro-Nuncio ( Sept. 11 , 1985 ) that " if it ( the judgment ) has been made , than I can perhaps begin to understand why the Holy See might reason that the only workable solution to this matter is the appointment of a man to assist me whose principal responsibilities will be to supply or ' fill in ' in those areas where it is thought that I am lacking. " 4. // The decisions after the visitation On Oct. 9 and 10 , 1985 , the results of the visitation were again shared with Archbishop Hunthausen in extensive consultation at the Apostolic Nunciature . It should be noted that the actual raw data from the interviews were not released to him , given the confidentiality assured to those who provided the information . However , the specific areas of concern to the Holy See were reviewed in detail and the Archbishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarification . In large measure he did not dispute the facts . Rather , it was his interpretation of the importance of these matters and the inadequacy of his response that were the principal concerns. // Before his request for an auxiliary was granted , consideration was given to a number of ways that another bishop could be of assistance in addressing the five problem areas , e. g. , the appointment of a co-adjutor with full power , the temporary appointment of an administrator , the appointment of an auxiliary with special faculties from the Holy See . In considering the alternatives , the Holy See gave careful attention to the effects that any decision would have on the church and the Archbishop of Seattle. // The Code of Canon Law ( canon 403 , s2 ) does contemplate cases when the Holy See grants special faculties . However , upon the recommendation of members of the hierarchy in the United States , it was agreed that Archbishop Hunthausen , after accepting the auxiliary , would himself give Bishop Wuerl responsibility over the areas of particular concern to the Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a letter dated Dec. 2 , 1985 , was not to lessen the significance of those special faculties . Rather , it allowed the Archbishop to follow a procedure analogous or similar to that used by other diocesan bishops , who share authority with auxiliaries in areas or over a territory . Simultaneously , the Archbishop of Seattle did acknowledge that the Holy See could reserve to itself , in an uncontested way , the right to adopt such measures as may subsequently become necessary . At no time did the Holy See require Archbishop Hunthausen to make a public announcement that he had agreed to surrender any episcopal duties . This was never contemplated. // For more than six months after the arrival of Bishop Wuerl , the agreed-to faculties were not given . When this was brought to the attention of Archbishop Hunthausen , he stated that , in his original understanding , he agreed that the auxiliary would supervise or manage these areas of concern as he , the Archbishop , determined . This could be attributed to a misunderstanding or misinterpretation on his part . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events that led to the compromise . The faculties , which were originally to be given by Rome , would be given instead by him as Archbishop , but with the same effect . The Archbishop of Seattle then petitioned the Holy See for an authoritative clarification. // When this was given , the Archbishop of Seattle granted the faculties and made the announcement that they were mandated by Rome . In fact , a more precise description would have been that this was the agreement reached between Archbishop Hunthausen and the Holy See after much discussion and effort to support him . Regretfully , the surprise announcement made by Archbishop Hunthausen after granting the faculties was interpreted as portraying this whole process as a one-sided affair. // The efforts made by the Holy See after the visitation were designed to address and strengthen those areas that were found wanting , and at the same time , to respect and recognize the position of the Archbishop . Meeting these goals required the corresponding cooperation of the Holy See , of the man who was selected and accepted as auxiliary , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
