BADEN , Switzerland  --  BBC Brown , Boveri &; Co. builds and sells huge electricity generating stations all over the world . But in its laboratories here , scientists are making ozone , building flat-screen liquid-crystal computer monitors , dabbling in artificial intelligence and studying code-breaking and two-way radio communication . None of this has much to do with electric power plants of the type Englishman Charles Brown and German Walter Boveri first built here in 1891 . But , says research director Ambros P. Speiser , research is " supposed to create new ideas , to reflect not our past businesses , but the ones we hope to build up . " Brown Boveri ' s chairman and acting chief executive , Fritz Leutwiler , who came home to Baden last June , hopes his scientists find those new ideas quickly , especially because power station orders are few and far between these days . But the former head of the Swiss National Bank , and recently the negotiator between South Africa and its banks , knows that turning around this troubled company will take time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solve our problems tomorrow , " he says . Those problems include a continued over-dependence on orders from electric utilities , a duplicative corporate bureaucracy struggling to manage 100 , 000 employees in 140 countries , too big a presence in the Middle East and too small a presence in the U.S. and Japan . Brown Boveri also has a reputation for producing exquisitely engineered products that are too late , too expensive or too sophisticated . " Engineers are perfectionists and Swiss and German engineers are even more perfectionist , " says a Brown Boveri official . Last month the company said it would report a sharply lower parent-company profit for 1985 and would skip its dividend for the first time in 48 years . Also , Chief Executive Piero Hummel resigned . Mr. Leutwiler , age 61 , who says he is taking the chief executive ' s job only until a successor is found next spring , is trying to reorganize and reinvigorate the $7 billion company , and particularly to shave costs and improve its marketing . Next week , he will introduce a sweeping reorganization and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have one substantial , fundamental , structural problem  --  low demand for power generation and distribution , " says Mr. Leutwiler . " Demand should pick up in the early 1990s , but now there is overcapacity and intense competition to produce this equipment . The main question for the whole industry is how to survive the next five to 10 years . " Mr. Leutwiler ' s answer is to reduce the company ' s dependence on building big power plants and move into related electronics fields . Last year the company spent $500 million , or about 9% of sales , on research and development , much of it to develop new products . It ' s a figure Mr. Leutwiler would like to increase , even though many of the new products won ' t be marketable for years . Brown Boveri wasn ' t able to make money on flat-screen monitors , although it now licenses the technology it developed . It ' s still trying to develop a commercial electric-car battery , as well as the technology to produce cheap ozone for purifying water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitoring systems . Meanwhile , Mr. Leutwiler is reorganizing the company into 24 divisions , each with world-wide responsibility for a product or service area , instead of the previous geographical divisions . " These 24 division heads must be our entrepreneurs , " he says . Perhaps his most important move was to reach agreement to increase the Swiss parent company ' s share of its German unit , based in Mannheim , to 75% from 56% , giving the parent full control under German law . Previously , the unit ' s management concentrated on maximizing its own return to German shareholders , to the point of duplicating development work and competing with the parent company for the same contracts . All this is meant to get Brown Boveri back into the competition with Westinghouse Electric Corp . , General Electric Co . , Siemens AG and other big power companies slugging it out for profitable slices of a shrinking market . The falling price of oil hurts these companies because Middle East oil producers have stopped ordering big plants . It helps , though , by allowing other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Leutwiler says he doesn ' t know yet whether the gains will outweigh the losses . Mr. Leutwiler readily acknowledges that he can ' t do much this year . " These are tough problems , to increase market share and profitability at the same time . " He says he hopes to return 1987 profits to the levels of 1984 , when the Swiss parent company had a profit of about $14 million on sales of $1. 4 billion , and the company earned $42. 5 million world-wide on sales of $6. 6 billion . And he says he ' d like to restore the dividend ( which is paid out of profits of the Swiss company ) " soon " but probably not this year .
