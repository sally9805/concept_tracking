A new NBC series , Bay City Blues , looks like an all-star <P> The number of TV shows that have revolved around the summer game can be counted on the fingers of a catcher 's mitt : Ball Four and The Bad News Bears . Both lasted less than a season , giving credence to the network adage that sports only play on the field , never on the sound stage . <P> That received wisdom may now be on the way out : one rookie series appears to have the goods to make it in the majors . Bay City Blues , which premieres Oct. 25 on NBC , is a weekly hourlong show about the fortunes of a minor-league baseball club called the Bay City Bluebirds . Kisses and bases are stolen ; suitors and batters strike out ; umpires and spouses cry foul . Created by Steven Bochco and Jeffrey Lewis ( Hill Street Blues ) , it is a wry , funny , poignant and surprisingly grownup show about men who play a boys ' game . <P> At Bluebird Stadium , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unseen hand changes the goose eggs each inning . No Astro-Turf here ; cows graze on the infield in anticipation of Farm Night , when the ballplayers have a hand at milking them . The team is a collection of youths on the way up and burned-out cases on the way down . There is the hot prospect ( Patrick Cassidy ) who is a terror in the outfield and a bed wetter at home . And the hick pitcher ( Barry Tubbs ) who appears to get height sickness when he climbs the pitcher 's mound . And Rocky , the brawny third baseman ( Ken Olin ) , a con man in pinstripes who hankers to croon the national anthem to a salsa beat . And an aging slugger ( Bernie Casey ) awarded a " previously owned " pimpmobile on his appreciation day . And , of course , the curmudgeonly owner , played by Pat Corley , the scowling coroner from Hill Street , who describes his team as " a bunch of guys who ai n't worth squat .

Nouri plays the wise and slightly mournful manager to understated perfection . His assistant , the underhanded pitching coach ( Dennis Franz , another Hill Street veteran ) , teaches his charges the subtler aspects of the game : " Your spitball is n't named exactly right . You could use your Vaseline , your oils , your earwax , or what I think is primo , the gooey white kind of spit that conies after drinking a lotta milk . " Later , when an umpire spies a foreign substance on the ball , the freshly instructed young pitcher ( Perry Lang ) is not only humiliated but disarmed . When he returns home after the game , he discovers his wife in a compromising squeeze play with the cable TV installer . Shocked and dumbfounded , he screams at her , " Is he at least gon na give you free cable ? "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
