In July of 1940 , my parents gave me a camera for my 15th birthday . It was a Kodak Brownie , one of those square , black box cameras with a fixed lens . It fascinated me and I quickly used up the single roll of film that came with it , firing indiscriminately at the family dog , a tree in the front yard and my father 's new Ford . I then unloaded the film , took it to the drugstore for processing and waited . The pictures that came back were disappointing . // My father , a hardworking banker , thought I could use better subject matter . He spent many summer weekend afternoons at our home in Chevy Chase , Md. dozing in a chair on our back porch listening to Arch McDonald , the voice of the feckless Washington Senators , broadcasting road games , and he suggested I bring the camera along the next time we went to a Senators game . Thrilled by the idea , I returned to the drugstore with my savings in hand and purchased another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of white ink and some new pen points with which to write captions under my photographs . // Last winter , some 40 years later , I was cleaning out a desk drawer that had been jammed shut . Therein I came upon that long-forgotten album , which was empty except for the 12 snapshots I took at that one ball game . The photos summoned up the summer of ' 40 and the sounds and scents of baseball as it was then . One picture showed the vast outfield of Griffith Stadium , with its high wall and manually operated scoreboard in right centerfield . In the next cracked but clear photograph was my father , smiling and resplendent in a summer straw . My father , the man who slept beside the old Crosley radio while McDonald droned on , the man I loved without qualification that summer before the war . How quickly it all came back . // Griffith Stadium was located on the edge of Washington 's black ghetto , a jumble of narrow streets , bungalows and back alleys where baseball fans could park their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 miles out of town , we parked and then walked along a tree-shaded side street to Georgia Avenue , across the trolley tracks and down a long hill to the park . // Virtually everything but the infield dirt at Griffith Stadium was green . The only other touch of color in the place was provided by the pennants of the eight American League teams that flew atop the wall back of the leftfield bleachers . The scoreboard listed only the scores and batteries of these teams . There was no mention of the National League in Clark Griffith 's park . Ever . // We entered the stadium and walked up a long ramp to the ground-level seats . We did n't buy tickets ; my father got them through some mysterious alchemy " at the bank " where he worked . If we 'd bought tickets , we would have paid 25 ? for the bleachers , 75 ? for reserved seats and $1.50 for the lower-level box seats . Scorecards were a dime , hot dogs the same . The stadium held about 30,000 , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendance fell off steadily , because the Nats ( as we also called the Senators ) always finished sixth or seventh . The team could count itself lucky if the crowd exceeded 5,000 , even on the days the hated Yankees came to town , led by the Yankee Clipper  --  the name Arch McDonald pinned on Joe DiMaggio. // Griffith Stadium had charm . If you were lucky enough to get a seat along the third-base line , as we were , you could talk with the coach or even the third baseman . And there was n't any place at ground level from which you could n't hear the chatter of the infielders or the encouragement of the catcher. // Those photographs of mine , with their deckle edges and white borders , captured that atmosphere . Looking at the album , I recalled searching for something to photograph . I could n't get a good shot of Cecil Travis , my personal hero . He was too far away , playing shortstop . I could n't get a shot of Dutch Leonard and his knuckleball delivery , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the visitors ' dugout and blindly aimed my Brownie down into the dimness . I had no idea who was sitting on the long bench below . The Philadelphia Athletics were in town , but they were even more lowly than the Nats . Nevertheless , they were major-leaguers , and their mentor and inspiration was the legendary Connie Mack . // When my roll of film was developed , the photo showed Mack , deep in conversation with another man in the dugout . Next to Mack was Charlie Berry , a former player who then coached for the A 's , staring out at the field . There is something so old-fashioned and lonely about the scene . I remember thinking at the time it was a silly picture : an old man who had no business managing a baseball team and another old man , both in street clothes , both with scorecards in their hands , both with their attention miles away from the matter at hand . But looking at the picture from a distance of 40 years , I realize how closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life . It 's the serenity of the scene that touches me now . It has the look of a Depression photograph or some minor league dugout in the Sally League . // Many of today 's fans , accustomed to AstroTurf and air-conditioned domes , would find Griffith Stadium decrepit and inadequate . If they did , they 'd miss the point . This old park , with its chipped green paint and its thick grassy outfield was baseball , just as Mack and Griffith were plantation owners whose workers were farm boys and mill hands and lovers of the game . Finding this snapshot , with all the memories locked behind its discolored surface , is to relive the past . And that 's what baseball is all about .
