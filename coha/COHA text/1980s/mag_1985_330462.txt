The narrator of this drowsy thriller , now being whooped as a likely best seller , is a U.S. journalist who specializes in the Soviet Union . An old love has asked him to help find her missing stepfather , a Canadian tycoon . As the hero searches , he unravels the mystery of her birth and the farfetched identity of her aristocratic Russian mother . <P> The action ranges across North America , France and darkest Russia , none of it convincingly in focus . In New Hampshire , for instance , Author Hyde has the Soviet bad guys , who are driving a small runabout , stop off at a farm to pick up a cord of wood , a quantity that would founder anything short of a sizable truck . Soviet village scenes do not seem any more real . The book 's most enduring enigma is why , having equipped his tale with the scaffolding of romance , Hyde keeps his reunited lovers separate for all but a few exceedingly decorous pages .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
