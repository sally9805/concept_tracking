 | " Nobody knows what the hell 's going on , Lieutenant , " Smith observed . " Why should they ? We sure as hell do n't . " " Ai n't that the truth ! " Edwards repacked his radio . " If those idiots would listen to me , we could have some fighter-bombers here to blast that ship inside two hours . God , but she 's a big one . How much equipment can you Marines load in something that big ? " " A lot , " Smith said quietly . " You think they 'll be trying to land more troops ? " " It figures , sir . They could n't have hit Keflavik with all that many ? figure a battalion , tops . This here 's a pretty big rock . I 'd sure as hell want more troops to hold it than that . Course , I 'm just a buck sergeant . " HAFNARFJORDUR , ICELAND The General could finally get to work . The first order of business was to board the single working helicopter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the ship sunk alongside the quay . He left a rifle company to secure the harbor area , sent another to Reykjavik airport to reinforce that , and detailed his last to get the division 's equipment moving off the ship . Then he flew to Keflavik to survey the situation . Most of the fires were still burning , he saw . The aircraft fuel dump nearest the base was ablaze , but the main storage tanks five kilometers away seemed intact , and , he could see , were already guarded by a BMD assault vehicle and some men . The assault regiment commander met him on one of the undamaged runways . " Keflavik air base is secure , Comrade General ! " he proclaimed . " How did it go ? " " Hard . The Americans were uncoordinated  --  one of the missiles hit their command post  --  but they did not give up easily . We have nineteen dead and forty-three wounded . We have accounted for most of the Marines and other security troops , and we are still counting the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " None that we know of . Too early to tell , of course , but some undoubtedly died in the fires . " The colonel waved at the smashed base area to the east . " How is the ship ? I heard he took a missile hit . " " And we were strafed by American fighters . He 's tied to the dock , and the equipment is being unloaded now . Can we use this airfield ? I ? " " Getting that report now . " The colonel 's radio operator handed his radiophone over . The colonel spoke for a minute or so . A five-man party of Air Force personnel had accompanied the second wave and was evaluating the base facilities . " Comrade General , the base radar and radio systems are destroyed . The runways are littered with debris , and they tell me that they need some hours  | to sweep them clear . Also the fuel pipeline is broken in two places . Fortunately it did not burn . For the moment we 'll have to use the airport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be intact . . . they recommend that the airlift come into Reykjavik . Have we secured that ? " " Yes , and it is intact . Any hope of getting information from the American aircraft ? " " Unfortunately not , Comrade . The aircraft were badly damaged from incoming missiles . Those that did not bum of their own accord were burned by their crews . As I said , they fought hard . " " Very well . I 'll send the remainder of your two battalions with your equipment as soon as we can get things organized . I 'll need the third at the dock for the moment . Set up your perimeter . Start the cleanup , we need this airfield operational as soon as possible . Get the prisoners together and ready to move . We 'll be flying them out tonight . They are to be treated correctly . " His orders on that score were very precise . Prisoners are assets . " As you say , Comrade General . And please get me some engineers so that we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nikolay Gennadyevich ! " The General ran back to his helicopter . Only nineteen dead . He 'd expected a higher number than that . Taking out the Marine command center had been a real stroke of luck . By the time his Hip returned to the dock , the equipment was already rolling off . The ship 's barges had been fitted with loading doors in their hulls , like miniature landing craft , which allowed vehicles to roll straight out . The units already were being organized on the dock and nearby lots . His staff officers were fully in charge of things , the General saw . To this point , Operation Polar Glory was a total success . When the Hip landed , it refueled from a line draped down from the ship 's side . The General went to his operations officer . " Reykjavik airport is secure also , Comrade General , and there we have complete fueling facilities . Is that where you want the airlift to come in ? " The General thought about that one . Reykjavik 's airport was a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the larger Keflavik was clear to bring in his reinforcements . " Yes . Send the code word to headquarters : I want the airlift to begin at once . " HILL 152 , ICELAND " Tanks . " Garcia had the binoculars . " A bunch of ' em and they all got red stars . Heading west on Route 41 . This ought a convince ' em , sir . " Edwards took the field glasses . He could see the tanks , but not the stars . " What kind are they ? They do n't look like real tanks . " It was now Smith 's turn . " That 's BMPs  --  maybe BMDs . It 's an infantry assault vehicle , like an amtrak . Holds a squad of men and a 73-millimeter  | gun . They 're Russian , that 's for sure , Lieutenant . I count eleven of the bastards , and maybe twenty trucks with men in ' em . " Edwards broke out his radio again . Garcia was right . This did get their attention . " Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edwards rattled off the names of his Marines . " We bugged out before the Russians got into the base . " " Where are you now ? " " Hill 152 , four kilometers due east of Hafnarfjordur . We can see all the way into the harbor . There are Russian vehicles heading west towards Keflavik , and some trucks  --  we ca n't tell what kind  --  heading northeast towards Reykjavik on Highway 41 . Look , guys , if you can whistle up a couple of Aardvarks , maybe we can kill that ship before she unloads , " the lieutenant said urgently . " I 'm afraid the Varks are a little busy right now , fella . In case nobody told you , there 's a shooting war in Germany . World War III kicked off ten hours ago . We 're trying to get a recon bird up your way , but it might take awhile . Nobody 's decided what to do about you either . For right now , you 're on your own . " " No shit , " Edwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edwards . Use your head , avoid contact with the enemy . If I read this right , you 're the only friendly we have there right now . It figures they 'll want you to keep the reports coming in . Observe and report . Conserve the battery power you have . Play it nice and cool , guy . Help will be coming , but it might take awhile . Just hang in there . You can listen for us on the hour , on even hours . You got a good watch ? " In the meantime , the communications officer thought , we 'll try to figure a way to find out if you 're really who you say , and that you have n't got a Russian pistol at your head . " Roger , it 's set to Zulu time . We 'll be listening . Out . " " More tanks , " Smith said . " Jeez , that ship sure is a busy place ! " HAFNARFJORDUR , ICELAND The General would not have believed how well things were going . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his mission would be a failure . Already a third of his vehicles had rolled off the ship and were en route to their destinations . Next , he wanted the rest of his division flown in . After that came more helicopters . For the present , all around him were a hundred thousand Icelanders whose friendship he did not expect . A few hardy souls were watching him from the opposite side of the harbor , and he 'd already sent a squad of men to get rid of them . How many people were making telephone calls ? Was the telephone-satellite relay base still intact ?  | Might they be calling the United States to tell what was happening in Iceland ? So many things to worry about . " General , the airlift is under way . The first aircraft took off ten minutes ago with a fighter escort . They should begin to arrive in four hours , " his communications officer reported . " Four hours . " The General looked up from the ship 's bridge into a clear blue sky . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighter-bombers at him ? He pointed to his operations officer . " We have too many vehicles sitting on the quay . As soon as a platoonsized grouping is together , move them off to their objectives . There is no time to wait for company groups . What about Reykjavik airport ? " " We have one company of infantrymen in place , with another twenty minutes away . No opposition . The civilian air controllers and the airport maintenance people are all under guard . A patrol going through Reykjavik reports little activity on the streets . Our embassy personnel report that a government radio broadcast told people to remain in their homes , and for the most part they seem to be doing this . " " Tell the patrol to seize the main telephone exchange . Leave the radio and television stations alone , but get the telephone exchange ! " He turned as a squad of paratroopers arrived at the crowd on the far side of the harbor . He estimated perhaps thirty people there . The eight soldiers approached quickly after dismounting from their truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the soldiers , waving his arms wildly . He was shot down . The rest of the crowd ran . The General shouted a curse . " Find out who did that ! " USS CHICAGO McCafferty returned to the attack center after a brief visit to his private head . Coffee would always keep you awake , he thought , either through the caffeine or the discomfort of an always-full bladder . Things were already not going well . Whatever genius had decided to order the American submarines out of the Barents Sea in the hope of avoiding an " incident " had neatly gotten them out of the way . Just in time for the war to start , the captain grumbled , forgetting that the idea had n't seemed all that bad at the time . Had they stuck to the plan , he might already have put a dent in the Soviet Navy . Instead , someone had panicked over the new Soviet missile sub dispositions , and so far as he could tell , the result was that no one had accomplished much of anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kola Fjord had not come south into the Norwegian Sea as expected . His long-range sonar reported possible submarine noises far to his north , heading west before fading out . So , he thought , Iran 's sending his boats down the  | Denmark Strait ? The SOSUS line between Iceland and Greenland could make that idea a costly one . USS Chicago was steaming at five hundred feet just north of the 69 ? parallel , about a hundred miles west of Norway 's rocky coastline . The Norwegians ' collection of diesel boats was inside of him , guarding their own coast . McCafferty understood that , but did n't like it . So far nothing had gone right , and McCafferty was worried . That was expected , and he could suppress it . He could fall back on his training . He knew what his submarine could do , and had a pretty good idea of what the Russian subs were capable of . He had the superior capabilities , but some Russian could always get lucky . This was war . A different sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books . Mistakes now were not a matter of a written critique from his squadron commander . And so far luck seemed to be on the other side . He looked around at his men . They had to be thinking the same thoughts , he was sure , but they all depended on him . The crewmen of his submarine were essentially the physical extensions of his own mind . He was the central control for the entire corporate entity known as USS Chicago , and for the first time the awesome responsibility struck him . If he messed up , all these men would die . And he , too , would die  --  with the knowledge that he had failed them . You ca n't think like this , the captain told himself . It will eat you up . Better to have a combat situation where I can limit my thinking to the immediate . He checked the clock . Good . " Take her up to periscope depth , " he ordered . " It 's time to check for orders , and we 'll try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a simple procedure , that . The submarine came up slowly , cautiously , turning to allow her sonar to make certain that there was not a ship around . " Raise the ESM . " An electronics technician pressed the button to raise the mast for his broad-band receiver . The board lit up instantly . " Numerous electronic sources , sir . Three J-band search sets , lots of other stuff . Lots of VHF and UHF chatter . The recorders are going . " That figures , McCafferty thought . The odds against having anyone here after us are pretty low , though . " Up scope . " The captain angled the search-scope lens upward to scan the sky for a nearby aircraft and made a quick turn around the horizon . He noticed something odd , and had to angle down the lens to see what it was . There was a green smoke marker not two hundred yards away . McCafferty cringed and spun the instrument back around . A multiengine aircraft was coming out of the haze  --  directly in at them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowering the  | instrument . " Take her down ! All ahead flank ! Make your depth eight hundred feet ! " Where the hell did he come from ? The submarine 's engines fairly exploded into action . A flurry of orders had the helmsmen push their controls to the stops . " Torpedo in the water , starboard side ! " a sonarman screamed . McCafferty reacted at once . " Left full rudder ! " " Left full rudder , aye ! " The speed log was at ten knots and rising quickly . They passed below one hundred feet . " Torpedo bearing one-seven-five relative . It 's pinging . Does n't have us yet . " Fire off a noisemaker . " Seventy feet aft of the control room , a five-inch canister was ejected from a launcher . It immediately started making all kinds of noise for the torpedo to home in on . " Noisemaker away ! " " Right fifteen degrees rudder . " McCafferty was calmer now . He 'd played this game before . " Come to new course one-one-zero . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Aye . Torpedo bearing two-zero-six , coming port-to-starboard . " Chicago passed through two hundred feet . The boat had a twenty-degree down angle . The planesmen and most of the technicians had seatbelts to hold them in place . The officers and a few others who had to circulate around grasped at rails and stanchions to keep from falling . " Conn , Sonar . The torpedo seems to be following a circular path . Now traveling starboard-to-port , bearing one-seven-five . Still pinging , but I do n't think it has us . " " Very well . Keep those reports coming . " McCafferty climbed aft to the plot . " Looks like he made a bad drop . " " Could be , " the navigator agreed . " But how in hell ? " " Had to be a MAD pass . The magnetic anomaly detector . Was the tape running ? I did n't have him long enough for an ID . " He checked the plot . They were now a mile and a half from where they 'd been when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fish . " " Bearing one-nine-zero , dead aft . Still circling , seems to be going down a little . I think maybe the noisemaker drew him in and he 's trying to hit it . " " All ahead two-thirds . " Time to slow down , McCafferty thought . They 'd cleared the initial datum point , and the aircraft 's crew would need a few minutes to evaluate their attack before beginning a new search . In that time they 'd be two or three miles away , below the layer , and making little noise . " All ahead two-thirds , aye . Leveling off at eight hundred feet . " " We can start breathing again , people , " McCafferty said . His own voice was not as even as he would have preferred . For the first time , he noted a few  | shaky hands . Just like a car wreck , he thought . You only shake after you 're safe . " Left fifteen degrees rudder . Come left to two-eight-zero . " If the aircraft dropped again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should be fairly safe now . The whole episode , he noted , had lasted less than ten minutes . The captain walked to the forward bulkhead and rewound the videotape , then set it up to run . It showed the periscope breaking the surface , the first quick search . . . then the smoke marker . Next came the aircraft . McCafferty froze the frame . The plane looked like a Lockheed P-3 Orion . " That 's one of ours ! " the duty electrician noted . The captain stepped forward into sonar . " The fish is fading aft , Cap'n . Probably still trying to kill the noisemaker . I think when it hit the water it circled in the wrong direction , away from us , I mean . " " What 's it sound like ? " " A lot like one of our Mark-46s " ? the leading sonarman shuddered ? " it really did sound like a forty-six ! " He rewound his own tape and set it on speaker . The screeeing sound of the twin-screw fish was enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went back aft . " Okay , that might have been a Norwegian P-3 . Then again it might have have been a Russian May . They look pretty much alike , and they have exactly the same job . Well done , people . We 're going to clear the area . " The captain congratulated himself on his performance . He 'd just evaded his first war shot  --  dropped by a friendly aircraft ! But he had evaded it . Not all the luck was with the other side . Or was it ? USS PHARRIS Morris was catnapping in his bridge chair , wondering what was missing from his life . It took a few seconds to realize that he was n't doing any paperwork , his normal afternoon pastime . He had to transmit position reports every four hours , contact reports when he had any  --  he had n't yet  --  but the routine paper-shuffling that ate up so much of his time was a thing of the past . A pity , he thought , that it took a war to relieve one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy it . The convoy was still twenty miles to his southeast . Pharris was the outlying sonar picket . Her mission was to detect , localize , and engage any submarine trying to close the convoy . To do that , the frigate was alternately dashing ? " sprinting " ? forward at maximum speed , then drifting briefly at slower speed to allow her sonar to work with maximum efficiency . Had the convoy proceeded at twenty knots on a straight course , it would have been nearly impossible . The three columns of merchantmen were zigzagging ,  | however , making life a little easier on all concerned . Except on the merchant sailors , for whom stationkeeping was as foreign as marching . Morris sipped at a Coke . It was a warm afternoon and he preferred his caffeine cold . " Signal coming in from Talbot , sir , " the junior officer of the deck reported . Morris rose and walked to the starboard bridge wing with his binoculars . He prided himself on being able to read Morse almost as quickly as his signalmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EXPECT MORE SERIOUS AIR AND SUB THREAT X. " More good news , skipper , " the OOD commented . " Yeah . " USS NIMITZ " How did they do it ? " Chip wondered aloud . " How do n't matter a damn , " Toland replied . " We got ta get this to the boss . " He made a quick phone call and left for flag country . He almost got lost . Nimitz had over two thousand compartments . The Admiral lived in only one of them , and Toland had only been there once . He found a Marine sentry at the door . The carrier 's commander , Captain Svenson , was already there . " Sir , we have a Flash message that the Soviets have attacked and neutralized Iceland . They may have troops there . " " Do they have aircraft there ? " Svenson asked at once . " We do n't know . They 're trying to get a recon bird to take a look , probably the Brits , but we wo n't have any hard information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass was two hours ago , and we wo n't have another one of those for nine hours . " " Okay , tell me what you have , " the Admiral ordered . Toland went over the sketchy data that had come in the dispatch from Norfolk . " From what we know , it was a pretty off-the-wall plan , but it seems to have worked . " " Nobody ever said Ivan was dumb , " Svenson commented sourly . " What about our orders ? " " Nothing yet . " " How many troops on Iceland ? " the Admiral asked . " No word on that , sir . The P-3 crew watched two relays of four hovercraft . At a hundred men per load , that 's eight hundred men , at least a battalion , probably more like a regiment . The ship is large enough to carry the equipment load for a full brigade and then some . It 's in one of Gorshkov 's hooks that this sort of ship is uniquely useful for landing operations . "  | " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , " Svenson said . A Marine Amphibious Unit consisted of a reinforced battalion of troops . " With three carriers backing them up ? " Admiral Baker snorted , then adopted a more thoughtful pose . " You could be right at that . What does this do to the air threat to us ? " " Iceland had a squadron of F-15s and a couple AWACS birds . That 's a lot of protection for us  --  gone . We 've lost raid warning , attrition , and raidtracking capabilities . " Svenson did n't like this at all . " We should be able to handle their Backfires ourselves , but it would have been a lot easier with those Eagles running interference . " Baker sipped at his coffee . " Our orders have n't changed . " " What else is going on in the world ? " Svenson asked . " Norway is being hit hard , but no details yet . Same story in Germany . The Air Force is supposed to have gotten a heavy hit in on the Soviets , again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantive intel assessments of what 's happening . " " If Ivan was able to suppress the Norwegians and fully neutralize Iceland , the air threat against this battle group has at least doubled , " Svenson said . " I have to get talking with my air group . " The captain left . Admiral Baker was silent for several minutes . Toland had to stay put . He had n't been dismissed yet . " They just hit Keflavik ? " " Yes , sir . " " Find out what else is there and get back to me . " " Yes , sir . " As Toland walked back to the intelligence shack , he pondered what he 'd told his wife : The carrier is the best-protected ship in the fleet . But the captain was worried .. . HILL 152 , ICELAND They were almost thinking of it as home . The position was at least easily defensible . No one could approach Hill 152 without being seen , and that meant crossing a lava field , then climbing up a steep , bare slope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently filled with water from the winter snows that had only lately melted . Sergeant Smith observed that it would have made a good mixer for bourbon , if they had any bourbon . They were hungry , but all had four days of rations along , and they feasted on such delicacies as canned lima beans and ham . Edwards learned a new and indelicate name for this item . " Anybody here know how to cook a sheep ? " Rodgers asked . Several miles south of them was a large herd of the animals . " Cook with what ? " Edwards asked . " Oh . " Rodgers looked around . There was n't a tree in sight . " How come there ai n't no trees ? "  | " Rodgers only been here a month , " Smith explained . " Prive , you ai n't never seen a windy day till you been here in the winter . The only way a tree can grow here is if you set her in concrete . I seen wind strong enough to blow a deuce-and-a-half right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the binoculars . He pointed northeast . " Lots . " Edwards took the field glasses . They were just dots , but they grew rapidly into shapes . " I count six , big ones , look like C-141s . . . that makes them IL-76s , I think . Maybe some fighters , too . Sergeant , get a pad and a pencil  --  we have to do a count . " It lasted for hours . The fighters landed first , rolling off to the refueling area at once , then taxiing to one of the shorter runways . One aircraft came in every three minutes , and Edwards could n't help be impressed . The IL-76 , code-named the Candid by the NATO countries , was an awkward , ungainly design , like its American counterpart . The pilots landed , stopped , and rolled their aircraft onto the taxiway off the main north-south runway as though they had practiced for months  --  as Edwards rather suspected they had . They unloaded at the airport terminal building , then rolled to the refueling area and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifting off came very close to their hill , close enough that Edwards was able to copy down a few tail numbers . When the count reached fifty , he set up his radio . " This is Edwards transmitting from Hill 152 . Do you copy , over . " " Roger , copy , " the voice came back at once . " From now on , your code name is Beagle . We are Doghouse . Continue your report . " " Roger , Doghouse . We have a Soviet airlift in progress . We have counted fifty  --  five-zero  --  Soviet transport aircraft , India-Lima-Seven-Six type . They are coming into Reykjavik , unloading , and rolling back out to the northeast . " " Beagle , are you sure , repeat are you sure of your count . " " That is affirmative , Doghouse . The takeoff run brings them right over our heads , and we got a paper record . No shit , mister , five-zero aircraft " ? Smith held up his pad ? " make that five-three aircraft , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting at the end of runway four . I ca n't make out the type , but they sure as hell look like fighters . You copy that , Doghouse ? " " I copy five-three transports and six possible fighters . Okay , Beagle , we got ta get this information upstairs fast . Sit tight and we 'll keep to the regular transmission schedule . Is your position safe ? " That 's a good question , Edwards thought . " I hear you , Doghouse . We 're staying put . Out . " He took off the headset . " We safe , Sergeant ? " " Sure , Lieutenant , I have n't felt this safe since Beirut . "  | HAFNARFJORDUR , ICELAND " A beautiful operation , Comrade General . " The Ambassador beamed . " Your support was most valuable , " the General lied through his teeth . The Soviet embassy to Iceland had over sixty members , almost all intelligence types of one sort or another . Instead of doing something useful , like seizing the telephone exchange , on donning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of the members of Iceland 's ancient Parliament , the Althing , had been arrested . Necessary , the General agreed , but too roughly done , with one of them killed in the process and two more shot . Better to be gentle with them , he thought . This was not Afghanistan . The Icelanders had no warrior tradition , and a gentler approach might have shown better returns . But that aspect of the operation was under KGB control , its control team already in place with the embassy personnel . " With your permission , there is much yet to be done . " The General went back up the jacob 's ladder onto the Fucik . Problems had developed in off-loading the division 's missile battalion . The barges that contained that equipment had been damaged by the missile strike . The newly installed landing doors had jammed solid and had to be torched free . He shrugged . Up to now , Polar Glory had been a near textbook operation . Not bad for a scratch crew . Most of his rolling equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been mated with their troops and dispersed . The SA-11 battalion was all that remained . " Bad news , Comrade General , " the SAM commander reported . " Must I wait for it ? " the General asked testily . It had been a very long day . " We have three usable rockets . " " Three ? " " Both these barges were ruptured when the American missile hit us . The shock damage accounted for several . The main damage came from the water used to fight the fire . " " Those are mobile missiles , " the General objected . " Surely the designers anticipated that they might get wet ! " " Not with saltwater , Comrade . This is the army version , not the naval , and it is not protected against saltwater corrosion . The men who fought the fire did so with great gusto , and most of the rockets were soaked . The exposed control wiring and the radar seeker heads on the missile noses were badly damaged . My men have run electronic tests of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can probably clean off and repair . The rest are ruined . We have to fly more in . " The General controlled his temper . So , a small thing that no one had  | thought of . Aboard ship , fires are fought with saltwater . They should have asked for the naval variant of this rocket . It was always the small things . " Divide your launchers as planned . Place all the usable missiles at the Reykjavik airport , and the ones you think you can fix at Keflavik . I 'll order the replacement rockets to be flown in . Is there other damage ? " " Apparently not . The radar antennae were covered with plastic , and the instruments inside the vehicles were safe because the vehicles themselves were sealed . If we get new rockets , my battalion is fully ready . We 'll be ready to travel in twenty minutes . Sorry , Comrade . " " Not your fault . You know where you are to go ? " " Two of my battery commanders have already checked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel . " The General climbed back up the ladder to the bridge to look for his communications officer . Within two hours a plane loaded with forty SA-11 surface-to-air missiles was rolling off Murmansk 's Kilpyavr airfield bound for Iceland .  | The Dance of the Vampires USS NIMITZ Toland had been a busy fellow for the past twelve hours . The data on Iceland came in slowly , one confusing piece at a time , and even now he did n't have enough to call a clear picture . The group 's orders had been changed , though only after too many hours of indecision . The mission to reinforce Iceland was a washout . For the past ten hours the battle group had been heading due east toward friendly air cover from England and France . Someone had decided that if the Marines could not go to Iceland , then they might find useful employment in Germany . Bob had expected them to be diverted to Norway , where a Marine Amphibious Brigade was already in place , but getting them there could prove difficult . A furious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty hours , with losses heavy on both sides . The Norwegians had started the war with scarcely a hundred modern fighters . They were screaming for help , but there was no help for anyone as yet . " They 're not just chewing the Norwegians up , " Toland observed . " They 're driving them south . Most of the attacks are on the northern bases , and they 're not giving them any breather at all . " Chip nodded . " That figures . Gives their Backfires a straighter shot at us . Briefing time . " " Yeah . " Toland packed up his notes and walked again toward flag country . It was easier this time . " Okay , Commander , " Admiral Baker said . " Start with the peripheries . " " Nothing much seems to be happening in the Pacific as yet . The Soviets  | are evidently putting a lot of diplomatic pressure on Japan . The same story they 've given the rest of the world  --  it 's all a German plot . " " Horseshit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's a plausible enough story that Greece is refusing to honor its treaty commitments , and a lot of neutral and third-world countries are buying it . Anyway , the Russians are making noises about giving the Sakhalin Islands back if they play ball  --  or pounding hell out of them if they do n't . Bottom line : Japan is not allowing any bases on its soil to be used for offensive strikes against the Soviet Union . What we have in Korea is needed there . The only carrier group we have in the Western Pacific is centered on Midway . They 're well out to sea at present , and they do n't have the moxie to go after Kamchatka alone . There 's some air activity in the South China Sea west of the Philippines , but nothing major yet . Cam Ranh Bay appears to be empty of Soviet shipping . So the Pacific is quiet , but that wo n't last long . " In the Indian Ocean , somebody launched a missile attack against Diego Garcia , probably a submarine .

' So Ivan has a secure southern flank , too , and so far it looks like he 's happy enough to keep it that way . So far the Russians are only fighting in Western Europe and against selected American installations elsewhere . They are telling anyone who 'll listen that they do n't even want to fight us . They 've even guaranteed the safety of American tourists and businessmen in the Soviet Union . Supposedly , they 're flying them all out through India .

The other attacks were against nuclear weapons storage sites , communications posts , and one big one against a tank site . Our guys were ready for it . We took losses , but those Spetznaz troops got chewed up in most cases . " The Soviet Army attacked west just before dawn yesterday . The good news here is that the Air Force pulled something really wild . That new  | Stealth fighter we 've been hearing rumblings about is in squadron service , and it was used to raise a lot of hell behind Russian lines . The Air Force says they 've got air superiority , or something close to it , so Ivan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the initial Russian attack was not as powerful as expected . They 're moving forward , but as of midnight nothing more than fifteen kilometers , and in two places they got stopped cold . So far no word on nukes or chemical weapons . Losses are reported heavy on both sides , especially up in northern Germany , where they moved the farthest . Hamburg is threatened . The Kiel Canal may have been hit with an airborne or airmobile attack , we 're not sure , but part is under Russian control . That situation is a little confused . A lot of activity on the Baltic , too . The fast attack boats of the German and Danish navies claim to have beaten up hard on a combined Soviet and East German attack , but again things are pretty confused . " Toland went on to describe the situation in Norway . " The direct threats against us are from submarines and aircraft . Ivan 's subs have been pretty busy . We have reports of twenty-two merchant ships sunk . The worst was Ocean Star , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eight hundred miles northwest of Gibraltar she took a missile hit , type unknown , but probably from a Juliet . She burned , lots of casualties . Two Spanish frigates are moving in for the search-and-rescue . " We have three submarines reported close to our course track , an Echo , a Tango , and a Foxtrot . There could be more , but intelligence reports have most of them south and west of us . When Iceland got neutralized , we lost the G-I-UK SOSUS line , and that will allow Ivan 's subs an easier access to the North Atlantic . SACLANT is dispatching subs to block the gaps . They 'll have to hustle ; we have reports of numerous Soviet submarines heading for the Denmark Strait . " " How many subs have we taken out ? " Svenson asked . " Lajes and Brunswick claim four kills . The P-3s got off to a good start . The bad news here is that one Orion is missing , and another reported being shot at by a sub-launched missile . This is being evaluated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In any case , the main threat to us now appears to be from aircraft , not subs . That could change by tomorrow , though . " " One day at a time . Get to Iceland , " Baker ordered . " The reports we had yesterday were correct . Evidently a regimental-sized unit came in by sea , and the rest of its division was airlifted in , starting around 1400 hours . We have to assume they 're all in by now . " " Fighters ? " Svenson asked . " None reported , but it 's possible . Iceland has four usable airfields ? " " Wrong , Toland , it 's three , " Baker said harshly . " Beg pardon , sir , four . The big base is Keflavik . Five runways , two of them over ten thousand feet long . We built the place to stage I3-52s out of ,  | and it 's quite a facility . Ivan got it virtually intact . His attack was planned deliberately not to crater the runways . Second , they have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about two thousand meters , plenty big enough for fighters , and it 's got a city wrapped around it . Hitting that place means running the risk of civilian casualties . On the north side of the island is Akureyri , one hard-surface strip . The fourth one , Admiral , is old Keflavik , about two miles southeast of the current NATO air base . It shows on the maps as unusable , but I ran into a guy who put in two years on Iceland . That strip is usable , certainly for rough-surface-capable aircraft like our C-130 . The base personnel use it for racing their go-carts and sports cars . He thinks you could use fighters out of there , too . Finally , every city on that island has a gravel strip for their domestic airline . The MiG-23 and several other Russian fighters have a rough-field capability , and could use any one of those . " " You 're full of good news , " observed Nimitz 's commander , air group , known as the CAG . " What about the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depot right on the base was destroyed in the attack , but the base tank-farm was not , and neither was the new terminal at Hakotstanger . Unless somebody takes it out , we 've left the Russians enough jet fuel to operate for months . " " How solid is all this ? " Baker wanted to know . " We have an eyeball report from a Navy P-3 crew who surveyed the damage immediately after the attack . The RAF sent two recce birds for a look-see . The first one got good shots of Keflavik and the surrounding area . The second did n't make it back , reason unknown . " " SAMs . " The CAG really looked unhappy now . Toland nodded . " A good bet . The photos show vehicles consistent with the presence of a reinforced Soviet Air Rifle division . Icelandic radio and TV are off the air . The Brits report contact with ham radio operators on the Icelandic coast , but nothing at all is coming out of the southwest corner of the island . That 's where most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely under Soviet control . We 're getting some intel information , but it ca n't last . " " What you 're telling us is that we ca n't expect raid warning from the Norwegians , and we 've lost our picket fence at Iceland . What other assets do we have ? " Svenson asked . " Evidently something . I 've been told to expect possible raid warning from an asset code-named Realtime . If a large force of Soviet aircraft leaves Kola , we ought to know about it . " " What 's Realtime ? " the CAG asked . " They did n't tell me that . " " Submarine . " Baker smiled thinly . " Jesus protect him when he transmits . Well , Ivan sent his bombers against Iceland yesterday . Anybody wonder where they 'll be coming today ? "  | " In case anyone wants it , my official intelligence estimate is , right here , " Toland said . " Always nice to have a professional opinion , " the CAG observed acidly . " We ought to head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and experience the CAG was an attack pilot ? " but we ca n't do that until we deal with the Backfires . What is the strength of the threat to us ? " " I 'm assuming no assistance from the Air Force units . With Soviet Naval Aviation alone we have six regiments of strike aircraft , three each of Backfires and Badgers . One regiment of Badger jammers . One regiment of Bear reconnaissance birds . Add some tanker assets to that . Twenty-seven aircraft to the regiment . That 's about a hundred sixty strike aircraft , each of which can carry two or three air-to-surface missiles . " " Those Badgers will have to stretch to get here . The round trip must be a good four thousand miles , even if they cut across Norway . Those are tired old birds , " CAG said . " What about their satellites ? " Toland checked his watch . " There will be a RORSAT pass over us in fifty-two minutes . They got us twelve hours ago , too . " " I hope the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon , " Svenson said quietly . " If Ivan can real-time that satellite intelligence , they do n't need those damned Bears . They can figure our course easily enough , and it 's only a four-hour cruise down here for them . " " Try a course change as it passes overhead ? " CAG wondered . " Not much point in it , " Baker replied . " We 've been heading east for ten hours . They ca n't miss that , and we can only do twenty knots . We can give them a plus-minus of eighty miles . How long does it take to fly that ? " Toland noted that Svenson and the CAG did n't like that decision , but neither disputed the point . He 'd been told that Baker was n't a man to argue with , and wondered if that was a good trait in a combat commander . HILL 152 , ICELAND Edwards took some solace in having predicted the cold front 's arrival properly . The rain had come exactly on time , just after midnight . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was a steady cold rain . The showers were intermittent now , a ceiling of gray clouds two thousand feet over their heads , blown along by thirty-knot winds toward Iceland 's mountainous center . " Where are the fighters ? " Edwards asked . He swept Reykjavik airport with his binoculars , but could n't find the six fighters he 'd reported on the previous evening . All the transports were gone also . He saw one Soviet helicopter and some tanks . There was very little traffic on the streets and roads he could see . Certainly not much for a Monday morning . Surely the  | commercial fishermen would be driving to their boats ? " Anybody see them lift out ? " " No , sir . Weather we had last night , the whole Russian Air Force could have come in and left . " Sergeant Smith was annoyed too , mainly with the weather . " Could be in those hangars , maybe . " About 2300 the previous night , they 'd observed a streak of light like that of a rocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been lost in a rain shower . Edwards had not reported that , halfway wondering if it might have been lightning . " What 's that ? That 's no tank . Garcia , check it out  --  five hundred yards west of the terminal . " The lieutenant handed the glasses over . " Okay . That 's some kinda tracked vehicle . Looks like it has some sort of  --  not a gun , there 's three of them . Rocket launcher , maybe . " " SAMs , " the sergeant commented . " How much you wan na bet that 's what we saw shot off last night ? " " E.T. , phone home . " Edwards started putting his radio together . " How many launchers and what type ? " Doghouse asked . " We see one launcher , possibly three missiles on it . We ca n't tell the type . I would n't know the difference anyway . They might have fired off a missile last night about 2300 local . " " Why the hell did n't you tell us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what it was ! " Edwards nearly yelled . " Goddammit ! We 're reporting on everything we see , and you do n't even believe half of what we tell you ! " " Settle down , Beagle . We believe you . I know it 's hard . Anything else happening ? " " He knows it 's hard , " Edwards told his men . " Ca n't see much activity at all , Doghouse . Still early , but we 'd expect civilian traffic on the streets . " " Copy that . Okay now , Edwards , real fast , what 's your father 's middle name ? " " Does n't have one , " Edwards said . " What ? " " The name of his boat ? " " The Annie Jay . What the hell is this ? " " What happened to your girlfriend Sandy ? " It was like a knife in the guts . The tone of his voice answered for him . " You go and fuck yourself ! " " Copy that , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to pass that test . We have no further orders for you yet . Tell you the truth , nobody 's decided what to do about you . Stay cool and avoid contact .

Going great . "  | " Roger . If you hear me say that , you know something 's wrong . Out . " KEFLAVIK , ICELAND The major commanding the Air Force detachment was enjoying himself despite having been up for over thirty hours . Keflavik was a magnificent base , and the paratroopers had captured it nearly intact . Most importantly , the Americans had thoughtfully stored their maintenance equipment in protective shelters dispersed throughout the base , and all of it had survived . As he watched from the smashed control tower , a half-dozen sweeper trucks were brushing the last fragments from runway nine . In thirty minutes it would be safe to use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by the end of the day the pipeline should be repaired . Then this would be a fully functional Soviet air base . " How long before our fighters arrive ? " " Thirty minutes , Comrade Major . " " Get the radar operating . " The Soviets had packed most of the equipment for a forward air base in one of the Fucik 's barges . A mobile long-range radar was now operating just west of the main runway intersection , plus a van from which ground controllers could direct radar intercepts of incoming targets . Three truck-vans of spare parts and air-to-air missiles were on the base , and three hundred maintenance personnel had been flown in the previous day . A full battery of SA-11 missiles guarded the runways , plus eight mobile antiaircraft guns and a platoon of infantrymen armed with hand-held SAMs for low-flying raiders . The only hangup had been with the SAMs , and the replacements flown in a few hours ago had already been loaded on the launcher vehicles . Any NATO aircraft that came waltzing into Iceland was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jaguar had discovered the night before , shot out of the sky over Reykjavik before its pilot could react . " Runway nine is cleared for operation , " the radio operator reported . " Excellent ! Now get them working on one-eight . I want every strip operational by this afternoon . " HILL 152 , ICELAND " What 's that ? " Edwards saw it first for a change . The wide silver wings of a Badger bomber skirted in and out of the lower cloud layer . Then something else . It was smaller , and it disappeared back into the clouds . " Was that a fighter ? " " I did n't see anything , sir . " Garcia had been looking in the wrong direction . The sound passed overhead , the distinctive whine of turbojets on a low throttle setting .  | The lieutenant was becoming a master at getting his radio in operation . " Doghouse , this is Beagle , and things are rotten . Do you copy ? " " Roger , Beagle . What do you have for us ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably for Keflavik . Stand by . " " I can hear ' em , but I do n't see nothin ' . " Garcia handed the glasses over . " I saw one twin-engine aircraft , probably a bomber , and one other aircraft , a lot smaller , like a fighter . We have aircraft sounds overhead , but we got solid clouds at about two thousand feet . No more visual sightings . " " You say heading towards Keflavik ? " " That 's affirm . The bomber appeared to be westbound and descending . " " Any chance you can walk back to Keflavik to see what 's happening there ? " Edwards did n't speak for a second . Could n't the bastard read a map ? That meant walking thirty miles over bare ground . " Negative . Say again , negative , no chance . Over . " " Understood , Beagle . Sorry about that . I had orders to ask . Get back to us when you have a better count . You 're doing good , guys . Hang in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to walk over to Keflavik , " Edwards announced as he took off his headset . " I said no . " " Real good , sir , " Smith observed . At least Air Force officers were n't total idiots . KEFLAVIK , ICELAND The first MiG-29 Fulcrum landed at Keflavik a minute later . It taxied behind a base jeep and stopped close to the tower . The major in command of the base was there to meet it . " Welcome to Keflavik ! " " Excellent . Find me a lavatory , " the colonel replied . The major motioned him to his own jeep  --  the Americans had left seventy jeeps behind , plus over three hundred private automobiles  --  and drove toward the tower . The American radios had been destroyed , but the plumbing was made of sterner stuff . " How many ? " " Six , " the colonel answered . " A Goddamned Norwegian F-16 jumped us off Hammerfest and got one before we knew he was there . Another aborted with engine trouble , and a third had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not yet . We have only one helicopter . More should be coming in today . " They pulled to the door . " Inside , second door on the right . " " Thank you , Comrade Major ! " The colonel was hack in three minutes .  | " The unglamorous side of flying fighter aircraft . Somehow we never warn our cadets about this . " " Here , coffee . The previous occupants were most kind to us . " The major unscrewed an American thermos . The colonel took the cup , savoring the flavor as though it were fine brandy while he watched his fighters land . " We have your missiles all ready for you , and we can refuel every aircraft from our trucks . How soon can you fly again ? " " I 'd prefer that my men get at least two hours to rest and eat . And I want those aircraft dispersed after they 're fueled . Have you been hit yet ? " " Only two reconnaissance aircraft , and we killed one . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The American will hit us today . I would . " USS NIMITZ " We have a new intel source on Iceland , code name Beagle , " Toland reported . They were in the carrier 's Combat Information Center now . " He counted over eighty transport flights into Reykjavik last night , at least six fighters with them . That 's enough airlift capacity for a whole airborne division and then some . Doghouse in Scotland says that they have an unconfirmed report of Soviet fighters landing now . " Have to be a long-range one . Foxhound , maybe a Fulcrum , " CAG said . " If they have them to spare . Well , we were n't planning to visit the place just yet . We might have a problem with them trying raid-escort , though . " " Any word on E-3 support from the U.K. ? " Baker asked Svenson . " Looks like none . " " Toland , when do you expect our friends to arrive ? " " The RORSAT passes overhead in twenty minutes . They 'll probably want that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any time after that , Admiral . If the Backfires tank up partway down and proceed at max power , two hours . That 's worst case . More likely four to five hours . " " CAG ? " The air group commander looked tense . " Each carrier has a Hummer radar bird up , a pair of F-14 Tomcats with each . Two more Tomcats on the catapults , ready to go at five minutes ' notice , another Hummer and a tanker . The rest of the fighters are at plus-fifteen on the roof , loaded and fueled . The flight crews are briefed . One Prowler over the formation , the rest ready to go at fifteen . The A-7s have buddy stores rigged . We 're ready . Foch has her Crusaders at plus-fifteen . Good birds , but short legs . When the time comes we 'll use them for overhead coverage . "  | KIROVSK , R.S.F.S.R. The Radar Ocean Reconnaissance Satellite , called a RORSAT , passed over the formation at 0310 . Its radar transmitter noted the formation and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the data was in Moscow . Fifteen minutes after that , flight crews were given their final brief at four military air bases grouped around the city of Kirovsk on the Kola Peninsula . The crews were quiet , no less tense than their American targets . Both sides mulled over the same thoughts . This was the exercise both sides had practiced for over fifteen years . Millions of hours of planning , studies and simulations were about to be put to the test . The Badgers lifted off first , pushed by their twin Mikulin engines . Each takeoff was an effort . The bombers were so heavily loaded that the tower controllers reached out with their minds to wish every aircraft into the still morning air . Once off the ground they headed north , forming up into loose regimental formations just north of Murmansk before heading west and skirting past the North Cape , before their slow left turns took them toward the North Atlantic . Twenty miles off the North Russian coast , USS Narwhal hovered beneath the surface of a slate-gray sea . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialized intelligence-gathering platform that spent more time on the Soviet coast than did some ships in the Russian Navy . Her three thin ESM antennae were raised , as was a million-dollar search periscope . Technicians aboard listened in on low-power radio conversations between aircraft as they formed up . Three uniformed intelligence specialists and a civilian from the National Security Agency evaluated the strength of the raid and decided that it was large enough to risk a warning broadcast . An additional mast was raised and aimed at a communications satellite twenty-four thousand miles away . The burst transmission lasted less than a fifteenth of a second . USS NIMITZ The message was automatically relayed to four separate communications stations , and within thirty seconds was at SACLANT headquarters . Five minutes after that , Toland had the yellow message form in his hand . He walked immediately to Admiral Baker , and handed the message over : 0418z REALTIME SENDS WARNING AIR RAID TAKE OFF 0400 HEADING WEST FROM KOLA ESTIMATE FIVE REGIMENT PLUS . Baker checked his watch . " Fast work . CAG ? " The air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone . " Shoot off the plus-fives , recall the patrol aircraft when they get to station , and set up two more Tomcats and a Hummer on plus-five . I want the  | returning aircraft turned around immediately . Reserve one catapult for tankers . " He came back . " With your permission , sir , I propose to put another pair of F-l4s and another Hummer up in an hour , and put all the fighters on plusfive . At 0600 , the rest of the fighters go up , with tankers in support . We 'll meet them with everything we have about two hundred miles out and kick their ass . " " Very well . Comments ? " Svenson looked pensively at the master plot . Circles were already being drawn for the farthest possible advance of the Soviet bombers . " The Brits get the same warning ? " " Yes , sir , " Toland answered . " Norwegians , too . With luck , one or the other might make contact with the raid and nibble at it some , maybe put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but do n't count on it . If I was running the attack , I 'd come way west and turn south right over Iceland . " Svenson looked back at the plot . " You think Realtime would have broadcast a warning for Bear-Ds ? " " My information , sir , is that they are allowed to broadcast only for three regiments or more . Ten or twenty Bears would n't be enough . They might not even notice . " " So right now we probably have a herd of Bears out there , not emitting anything , just flying around listening for our radar signals . " Toland nodded agreement . The battle group was a circle of ships with a radius of thirty miles , the carriers and troop ships in the center surrounded by nine missile-armed escorts and six more specialized antisubmarine ships . None of the ships had a radar transmitter working . Instead , they got all their electronic information from the two circling E-2C air-surveillance aircraft , known colloquially as Hummers , whose radars swept a circle over four hundred miles across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most intricate game . More than a dozen variable factors could interact , with their permutations running into the thousands . Radar detection range depended on altitude and consequent distance to the horizon that neither eyes nor radar can see past . An aircraft could avoid , or at least delay , detection by skimming the waves . But this carried severe penalties in fuel consumption and range . They had to locate the battle group without being detected by it first . The Russians knew where the carrier group was , but it would move in the four hours required for the bombers to get there . Their missiles needed precise information if they were to home in on the raid 's primary target , the two American and one French carrier , or the mission was a wasted effort . Putting the group 's fighters on station to intercept the incoming raid depended on expert prognostication of its direction and speed . Their job : to locate and engage the bombers before they could find the carriers . For both sides , the fundamental choice was whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Either choice carried benefits and dangers , and there was no " best " solution to the problem . Nearly every American ship carried powerful air-search radars that could locate the raid two hundred or more miles away . But those radar signals could be detected at an even greater range , generating a return signal , that would potentially allow the Soviets to circle the formation , pinpoint it , then converge in from all points of the compass . The game was hide and seek , played over a million square miles of ocean . The losers died . NORTH ATLANTIC The Soviet Bear-D reconnaissance bombers were passing south of Iceland . There were ten of them , covering a front of a thousand miles . The monstrous propeller-driven aircraft were packed full of electronics gear and crewed by men with years of training and experience in locating the American carrier groups . At the nose , tail , and wingtips , sensitive antennae were already reaching out , searching for the signals from American radar transmitters . They would close on those signals , chart them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radius . Their greatest fear was that the Americans would use no radar at all , or that they would switch their sets on and off at random intervals and locations , which posed the danger of the Bears ' blundering directly into armed ships and aircraft . The Bear had twenty hours of endurance , but the penalty for it was virtually no combat capability . It was too slow to run from an interceptor , and had no ability to fight one . " We have located the enemy battle force , " the crews ' bitter joke ran : " Dosvidania , Rodina ! " But they were a proud group of professionals . The attack bombers depended on them  --  as did their country . Eight hundred miles north of Iceland , the Badgers altered their course to one-eight-zero , due south at five hundred knots . They had avoided the stilldangerous Norwegians , and it was not thought that the British would reach this far out . These air crews kept a nervous watch out their windows nevertheless , their own electronic sensors fully operative and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iceland was expected at any time , and the bomber crews knew that any NATO fighter pilot worthy of his name would instantly jettison his bombload for a chance at air-to-air combat with so helpless a target as a twenty-year-old Badger . They had reached the end of their useful lives . Cracks were developing in the wings . The turbine blades in their jet engines were worn , reducing performance and fuel efficiency . Two hundred miles behind them , the Backfire bombers were finishing their refueling operations . The Tu-22Ms had been accompanied by tankers , and , after topping off their tanks , they headed south . slightly west of the Badgers ' course track . With an AS-6 Kingfish missile hanging under each  | wing , the Backfires , too , were potentially vulnerable , but the Backfire had the ability to run at high Mach numbers and stood a fair chance at survival , even in the face of determined fighter opposition . Their crews were the elite of Soviet Naval Aviation , well-paid and pampered by Soviet society , their commanders had reminded them at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All three groups of aircraft came south at optimum cruise speed , their flight crews monitoring fuel consumption , engine heat , and many other gauges for the long over-water flight . U S S NIMITZ Toland stepped outside for a breath of air . It was a fine morning , the cottonball clouds overhead turning briefly pink from the sunrise . Saratoga and Foch were visible on the horizon , perhaps eight miles away , their size impressive even at this distance . Closer in , Ticonderoga was cutting through the five-foot seas , white-painted missiles visible on her twin launchers . A few blinker lights traded signals . Otherwise the ships in view were gray shapes without noise , waiting . Nimitz 's deck was covered with aircraft . F-14 Tomcat interceptors sat everywhere . Two were hooked up on the midships catapults , only a hundred feet from him , their two-man flight crews dozing . The fighters carried Phoenix long-range missiles . The attack bombers carried buddy-store tanks instead of weapons . They 'd be used to refuel the fighters in flight , enabling them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multicolored shirts scurried about , checking and rechecking the aircraft . The carrier began turning to port , coming around into the westerly wind in preparation for launching aircraft . He checked his watch . 0558 . Time to get back to CIC . The carrier would go to general quarters in two minutes . The intelligence watch officer took one more breath of fresh sea air and wondered if it would be his last . NORTH ATLANTIC " Contact ! " the technician said over the Bear 's interphone . " Signals indicate an American airborne radar transmitter , carrier type . " " Give me a bearing ! " the pilot commanded . " Patience , Comrade Major . " The technician made an adjustment on his board . His radio-interferometers timed the signals as they arrived at antennae arrayed all over the aircraft . " Southeast . Bearing to signal is one-three-one . Signal strength one . He is quite distant . Bearing is not changing as yet . I recommend we maintain a constant course for the present . " The pilot and copilot exchanged a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an American E-2C Hawkeye radar aircraft . A flight crew of  | two  --  a radar intercept officer and two radar operators . It could manage the air battle for over a hundred enemy aircraft , could vector a missile-armed interceptor in at them within seconds of detection . The pilot wondered just how accurate his information was on the Hawkeye 's radar . What if they had already detected his Bear ? He knew the answer to that . His first warning would come when he detected the fire-control radar of an American F-14 Tomcat heading right at him . The Bear held course one-eight-zero while the plotting officer tracked the change in bearing to the radar signal . In ten minutes they might just have an accurate fix . If they lived that long . They would not break radio silence until they had a fix . " I have it , " the plotting officer reported . " Estimate distance to contact is six hundred fifty kilometers , position forty-seven degrees , nine minutes north , thirty-four degrees , fifty minutes west . " " Get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antenna in the aircraft 's tail fin turned within its housing and radioed the information to the raid commander , whose Bear command aircraft was a hundred miles behind the snoopers . The raid commander compared this datum with that from the reconnaissance satellite . Now he had two pieces of information . The Americans ' position three hours ago was sixty miles south of the estimated plot for the Hawkeye . The Americans probably had two of them up , northeast and northwest of the formation . That was normal fleet doctrine . So , the carrier group was right about . . . here . The Badgers were heading right for it . They would encounter the American radar coverage in . . . two hours . Good , he said to himself . Everything is going according to plan . USS NIMITZ Toland watched the aircraft plot in silence . The radar picture from the Hawkeyes was being transmitted to the carrier by digital radio link , enabling the battle group commander to follow everything . The same data went to the group air defense boss on Ticonderoga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ System . That included the French ships , which had long since been equipped to operate closely with the U.S. Navy . So far there was nothing to be seen except the tracks of American military and commercial aircraft ferrying men and supplies across the ocean , and dependents back to the States . These were beginning to swing south . Warned that an air battle was possible , the pilots of DC-10s and C-5As were prudently keeping out of the way , even if it meant having to land and refuel on the way to their destinations . The group 's forty-eight Tomcat interceptors were now mostly on station , spread in a line three hundred miles across . Each pair of Tomcats had a tanker aircraft in attendance . The attack birds , Corsairs and Intruders , carried oversized fuel tanks with refueling drogues attached , and one by one the  | Tomcats were already beginning to top off their fuel tanks from them . Soon the Corsairs began returning to their carriers for refills . They could keep this up for hours . The aircraft remaining on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a raid came in , they would be shot off the catapults at once to eliminate the fire hazard inherent in any type of aircraft . Toland had seen all this before , but could not fail to be amazed by it . Everything was going as smoothly as a ballet . The aircraft loitered at their patrol stations , tracing lazy , fuel-efficient circles in the sky . The carriers were racing east now at thirty knots to make up the distance lost during launch operations . The Marines ' landing ships Saipan , Ponce , and Newport could make only about twenty knots , and were essentially defenseless . East of the group , carrier S-3A Viking and land-based P-3C Orion antisubmarine aircraft were patrolling for Soviet submarines . They reported to the group ASW commander on the destroyer Caron . There was as yet nothing for anyone to direct his frustration against . The old story known to all fighting men . You wait . NORTH ATLANTIC The raid commander was rapidly accumulating data . He now had positions on four American Hawkeyes . The first two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , outside and south of the first . The Americans had unwittingly given him a very accurate picture of where the battle group was , and the steady eastward drift of the Hawkeyes gave him course and speed . His Bears were now in a wide semicircle around the Americans , and the Badgers were thirty minutes north of American radar cover , four hundred miles north of the estimated location of the ships . " Send to Group A : Enemy formation at grid coordinates 456/810 , speed twenty , course one-zero-zero . Execute Attack Plan A at 0615 Zulu time . ' Send the same to Group B. Tactical control of Group B switches to Team East Coordinator . " The battle had begun . The Badger crews exchanged looks of relief . They had detected the American radar signals fifteen minutes before , and knew that each kilometer south meant a greater chance that they would run into a cloud of enemy fighters .

They had a solid fix on the NATO forma-  | tion , but they needed better if they were to locate and engage the carriers . These crews were not relieved , but excited . Now came the challenging part . The battle plan had been formulated a year before and practiced  --  over land exclusively  --  five times . Four times it had worked . Aboard eighty Badger bombers , pilots checked their watches , counting off the seconds to 0615 Zulu . " Launch ! " The lead Badger launched eight seconds early . First one , then the second , aircraft-shaped Kell dropped free of its pylon , falling several to thirty thousand feet and cruised on south at six hundred knots indicated air speed . The bomber crews watched their birds proceed for a minute or two , then each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission done . Six Badger-J stand-off jamming aircraft continued south . They would stay sixty kilometers behind the Kelts . Their crews were nervous but confident . It would not be easy for American radar to burn through their powerful jammers , and in any case , the Americans would soon have many targets to concern them . The Kelts continued on , straight and level . They carried their own electronic equipment , which would be triggered automatically by sensors in their tail fins . When they entered the theoretical arc of the Hawkeyes ' radar range , transponders in their noses clicked on . USS NIMITZ " Radar contacts ! Designate Raid-1 , bearing three-four-niner , range four-sixzero miles . Numerous contacts , count one-four-zero contacts , course oneseven-five , speed six hundred knots .

Contacts are lost for the present . Estimate bum-through in ten minutes . Request weapons free , and release to vector intercepts . " Baker looked over to his air operations officer . " Let 's get things started . " Air/Ops nodded and picked up a microphone . " Hawk-Three , this is Clipper Base . Weapons free . I say again , weapons are free . Release authority is granted . Splash me some bombers . Out . "  | Svenson frowned at the display . " Admiral , we 're coming about to clear decks . Recommend the formation stays together now . " He got a nod .

Engineering test pilot , assistant project officer for the ASAT program  --  I 'm good enough to get an invite to Houston , even  --  but will they let me fly combat ? No , there 's a war going on and I 'm nothing but a Goddamned ferry pilot ! " Shit . " Her name was Amy Nakamura . She was a major , United States Air Force , with three thousand hours of jet time , two-thirds of it in F-15s . Short and stocky like many fighter pilots , only her father had ever called her beautiful . He also called her Bunny . When her fellow pilots found that one out , they shortened it to Buns . She and three men were ferrying four brandnew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would get to use them properly . They each carried fast-pack conformal fuel tanks to make the trip in one long hop , and for self-defense a single Sidewinder missile , plus their usual load of 20mm cannon shells .

Nakamura had phenomenal eyesight , but she could scarcely believe it . " Tell me what you see , Butch . " " Badgers . . . ? " " Fuckin ' Tu-16 Badgers  --  tallyho ! Where 's the Navy supposed to be ? " " Close . Try and raise ' em , Buns ! " " Navy task force , Navy task force , this is Air Force ferry flight GolfFour-Niner .

" " Then what the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nakamura reached down without looking to toggle up her missile and head-up display to tactical . Then she flipped the switch for her air-intercept radar . Her IFF system interrogated the target as a possible friendly and came up blank . That was enough . " Frank , take your element east . Butch , follow me . Everybody watch your fuel states . Charge ! " The Badger pilots were a little too relaxed , now that the most dangerous part of their mission was behind them . They did n't spot the four American fighters until they were less than a mile away , their robin's-egg-blue paint blending them in perfectly with the clear morning sky . Buns selected her cannon for the first pass and triggered two hundred rounds into the cockpit of a Badger . The twin-engine bomber went instantly out of control and rolled over like a dead whale . One . The major howled with delight , pulled the Eagle up into a five-g loop , then over to dive on the next target . The Soviets were alerted now , and the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest chance . Nakamura fired her Sidewinder from a range of less than a mile and watched the missile trace all the way into the Badger 's left-side engine , and blast the wing right off the airplane . Two . Another Badger was three miles ahead . Patience , she told herself . You have a big speed advantage . She nearly forgot that the Russian bomber had tail guns . A Soviet sergeant reminded her of it , missing , but scaring the hell out of her . The Eagle jerked in a six-g turn to the left and closed on a parallel course before turning in . The next burst from her cannon exploded the Badger in midair , and she had to dive to avoid the wreckage . The engagement lasted all of ninety seconds , and she was wringing wet with perspiration .  | " Butch , where are you ? " " I got one ! Buns , I got one ! " The Eagle pulled up alongside . Nakamura looked around . Suddenly the sky was clear . Where had they all gone ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read , over ? " " Roger , Golf . " " Okay , Navy . We just smoked four , repeat four , Badgers for you . " " Make that five , Buns ! " the other element leader called in . " Something 's wrong , sir . " The radar operator on Hawk-One motioned to his scope . " We have these buggers just popped through , and they say they bagged some , got ta be three , four hundred miles away . " " Clipper Base , this is Hawk-One , we just had contact with an Air Force ferry flight eastbound . They claim they just splashed five Badgers northbound several hundred miles north of us . Say again northbound . " Toland 's eyebrows went up . " Probably some had to abort , " Baker observed . " This is close to their fuel limit , is n't it ? " " Yes , sir , " replied Air/Ops . He did n't look happy with his own answer . " Burn-through , " announced the radar operator . " We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oblivious to the furor around them . Their radar transponders made them look like hundred-ten-foot Badgers . Their own white-noise jammers came on , somewhat obscuring them yet again on the radar scopes , and autopilot controls began to jerk them up , down , left , right , in hundred-meter leaps as an aircraft might do when trying to avoid a missile . The Kelts had been real missiles once , but on retirement from front-line service six years earlier , their warheads had been replaced with additional fuel tankage , and they had been relegated to a role as target drones , a purpose they were serving admirably now . " Tallyho ! " The first squadron of twelve Tomcats was now a hundred fifty miles away . The Kelts showed up perfectly on radar , and the intercept officers in the back seat of each fighter quickly established target tracks . The Kelts were approaching what would have been nominal missile-launch distance  --  if they were the bombers everyone thought they were . The Tomcats launched a volley of million-dollar AIM-54C Phoenix missiles at a range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their targets at Mach-5 , directed by the fighters ' targeting radars . In under a minute the  | forty-eight missiles had killed thirty-nine targets . The first squadron broke clear as the second came into launch position . USS NIMITZ " Admiral , something is wrong here , " Toland said quietly . " What might that be ? " Baker liked the way things were going . Enemy bomber tracks were being wiped off his screen just as the war games had predicted they would . " The Russians are coming in dumb , sir . " " So ? " " So this far the Soviets have not been very dumb ! Admiral , why are n't the Backfires going supersonic ? Why one attack group ? Why one direction ? " " Fuel constraints , " Baker answered . " The Badgers are at the limit of their fuel , they have to come in direct . " " But not the Backfires ! " " The course is right , the raid count is right . " Baker shook his head and concentrated on the tactical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unable to get a headon shot , their missile accuracy suffered somewhat . They killed thirty-four targets with forty-eight missiles . There had been a hundred fifty-seven targets plotted . The third and fourth Tomcat squadrons arrived together and launched as a group . When their Phoenixes had been fully expended , nineteen targets were left . The two fighter squadrons moved in to engage the remaining targets with their cannon . " Clipper Base , this is SAM Boss . We 're going to have some leakers . Recommend we start lighting up SAM radars . " " Roger , SAM Boss . Permission granted , " answered the group tactical warfare coordinator . NORTH ATLANTIC " I have air-search radars , bearing zero-three-seven , " the Bear ESM officer noted . " They have detected us . Recommend we illuminate also . " The Bear lit off its Big Bulge look-down radar . USS NIMITZ " New radar contact . Designate Raid-2 ? " " What ? " snapped Baker . Next came a call from the fighters . " ( Tipper Base , this is Slugger Lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The squadron commander was trying to examine the target on his long-range TV  | camera . When he spoke , the anguish in his voice was manifest . " Warning , warning , this is not a Badger . We 've been shooting at Kelt missiles ! " " Raid-2 is seventy-three aircraft , bearing two-one-seven , range onethree-zero miles . We have a Big Bulge radar tracking the formation , " said the CIC talker . Toland cringed as the new contacts were plotted . " Admiral , we 've been had . " The group tactical warfare officer was pale as he toggled his microphone . " Air Warning Red . Weapons free ! Threat axis is two-one-seven . All ships turn as necessary to unmask batteries . " The Tomcats had all been drawn off , leaving the formation practically naked . The only armed fighters over the formation were Foch 's eight Crusaders , long since retired from the American inventory . On a terse command from their carrier , they went to afterburner and rocketed southwest toward the Backfires . Too late . The Bear already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians could not determine ship type , but they could tell large from small , and identify the missile cruiser Ticonderoga by her distinctive radar emissions . The carriers would be close to her . The Bear relayed the information to her consorts . A minute later , the seventy Backfire bombers launched their hundred forty AS-6 Kingfish missiles and turned north at full military power . The Kingfish was nothing like the Kelt . Powered by a liquid-fuel rocket engine , it accelerated to nine hundred knots and began its descent , its radarhoming head tracking on a pre-programmed target area ten miles wide . Every ship in the center of the formation had several missiles assigned . " Vampire , Vampire ! " the CIC talker said aboard Ticonderoga . " We have numerous incoming missiles . Weapons free . " The group antiair warfare officer ordered the cruiser 's Aegis weapons system into full automatic mode . Tico had been built with this exact situation in mind . Her powerful radar/computer system immediately identified the incoming missiles as hostile and assigned each a priority of destruction . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its electronic will at anything diagnosed as a threat . Numbers , symbols , and vectors paraded across the master tactical display . The fore and aft twin missile launchers trained out at the first targets and awaited the orders to fire . Aegis was stateof-the-art , the best SAM system yet devised , but it had one major weakness : Tico carried only ninety-six SM2 surface-to-air missiles ; there were one hundred forty incoming Kingfish . The computer had not been programmed to think about that . Aboard Nimitz , Toland could feel the carrier heeling into a radical turn , her engines advanced to flank speed , driving the massive warship at over  | thirty-five knots . Her nuclear-powered escorts , Virginia and California , were also tracking the Kingfish , their own missiles trained out on their launchers . The Kingfish were at eight thousand feet , one hundred miles out , covering a mile every four seconds . Each had now selected a target , choosing the largest within their fields of view . Nimitz was the nearest large ship , with her missile-ship escorts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the targets reached a range of ninety-nine miles . The rockets exploded into the air , leaving a trail of pale gray smoke . They had barely cleared the launch rails when the mounts went vertical and swiveled to receive their reloads . The load-and-fire time was under eight seconds . The cruiser would average one missile fired every two seconds . Just over three minutes later , her missile magazines were empty . The cruiser emerged from the base of an enormous gray arch of smoke . Her only remaining defenses were her gun systems . The SAMs raced in at their targets with a closing speed of over two thousand miles per hour , directed in by the reflected waves of the ship 's own fire-control radars . At a range of a hundred fifty yards from their targets , the warheads detonated . The Aegis system did quite well . Just over 60 percent of the targets were destroyed . There were now eighty-two incoming missiles targeted on a total of eight ships . Other missile-equipped ships joined the fray . In several cases two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The number of incoming " vampires " dropped to seventy , then sixty , but the number was not dropping quickly enough . The identity of the targets was now known to everyone . Powerful active jamming equipment came on . Ships began a radical series of maneuvers like some stylized dance , with scant attention paid to station-keeping . Collision at sea was now the least of anyone 's worries . When the Kingfish got to within twenty miles , every ship in the formation began to fire off chaff rockets , which filled the air with millions of aluminized Mylar fragments that fluttered on the air , creating dozens of new targets for the missiles to select from . Some of the Kingfish lost lock with their targets and started chasing Mylar ghosts . Two of them got lost , and selected new targets on the far side of the formation . The radar picture on Nimitz suddenly was obscured . What had been discrete pips designating the positions of ships in the formation became shapeless clouds . Only the missiles stayed constant : inverted V-shapes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last wave of SAMs killed three more . The vampire count was down to forty-one . Toland counted five heading for Nimitz . Topside , the final defensive weapons were now tracking the targets . These were the CIWS , 20mm Gatling guns , radar-equipped to explode incoming missiles at a range of under two thousand yards . Designed to operate in a fully automatic mode , the two after gun mounts on the carrier angled up  | and began to track the first pair of incoming Kingfish . The portside mount fired first , the six-barrel cannon making a sound like that of an enormous zipper . Its radar system tracked the target , and tracked the outgoing slugs , adjusting fire to make the two meet . The leading Kingfish exploded eight hundred yards from Nimitz ' s port quarter . The thousand kilograms of high explosive rocked the ship . Toland felt it , wondering if the ship had been hit . Around him , the CIC crewmen were concentrating frantically on their jobs . One target track vanished from the screen . Four left . The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sky by the forward CIWS , too close aboard . Fragments ripped across the carrier 's deck , killing a dozen exposed crewmen . Number three was decoyed by a chaff cloud and ran straight into the sea half a mile behind the carrier . The warhead caused the carrier to vibrate and raised a column of water a thousand feet into the air . The fourth and fifth missiles came in from aft , not a hundred yards apart . The after gun mount tracked on both , but could n't decide which to engage first . It went into Reset mode and petulantly did n't engage any . The missiles hit within a second of one another , one on the after port corner of the flight deck , the other on the number two arrestor wire . Toland was thrown fifteen feet , and slammed against a radar console . Next he saw a wall of pink flame that washed briefly over him . Then came the noises . First the thunder of the explosion . Then the screams . The after CIC bulkhead was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Men twenty feet away were ablaze , staggering and screaming before his eyes . Toland 's only thought was escape . He bolted for the watertight door . It opened miraculously under his hand and he ran to starboard . The ship 's firesuppression systems were already on , showering everything with a curtain of saltwater . His skin burned from it as he emerged , hair and uniform singed , to the flight deck catwalk . A sailor directed a water hose on him , nearly knocking him over the side . " Fire in CIC ! " Toland gasped . " What the hell ai n't ! " the sailor screamed . Toland fell to his knees and looked outboard . Foch had been to their north , he remembered . Now there was a pillar of smoke . As he watched , the last Kingfish was detonated a hundred feet over Saratoga 's flight deck . The carrier seemed undamaged . Three miles away , Ticonderoga 's after superstructure was shredded and ablaze from a rocket that had blown up within yards of her . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another  --  my God , Toland thought , might that be Saipan ? She had two thousand Marines aboard .. . " Get forward , you dumbass ! " a firefighter yelled at him . Another man emerged to the catwalk .  | " Toland , you all right ? " It was Captain Svenson , his shirt torn away and his chest bleeding from a half-dozen cuts . " Yes , sir , " Bob answered . " Get to the bridge . Tell ' em to put the wind on the starboard beam . Move ! " Svenson jumped up onto the flight deck . Toland did likewise , racing forward . The deck was awash in firefighting foam , slippery as oil . Toland ran recklessly , falling hard on the deck before he reached the carrier 's island . He was in the pilothouse in under a minute . " Captain says put the wind on the starboard beam ! " Toland said . " It is on the fucking beam ! " the executive officer snapped back . The bridge deck was covered with broken glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's aft with the fire . " " And who the hell are you ? " the XO demanded . " Toland , group intel . I was in CIC .

" " Looks like you caught part of it , Commander . " Bob 's face felt as if he 'd shaved with a piece of glass . His eyebrows crumpled to his touch . " Flashburns , I guess . I 'll be okay . What do you want me to do ? " The XO pointed to Toland 's water wings . " Can you conn the ship ? Okay , do it . Nothing left to run into anyway . I 'm going aft to take charge of the fire . Communications are out , radar 's out , but the engines are okay and the hull 's in good shape . Mr. Bice has the deck . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . Toland had n't conned anything bigger than a Boston Whaler in over ten years , and now he had a damaged carrier . He took a pair of binoculars and looked around to see what ships were nearby . What he saw chilled him . Saratoga was the only ship that looked intact , but on second glance her radar mast was askew . Foch was lower in the water than she ought to have been , and ablaze from bow to stem . " Where 's Saipan ? " " Blew up like a fucking firework , " Commander Bice replied . " Holy Jesus , there were twenty-five hundred men aboard ! Tico took one close aboard . Foch took three hits , looks like she 's gone . Two frigates and a destroyer gone , too  --  just fucking gone , man ! Who fucked up ' ? You were in CIC , right ? Who fucked up ? " The eight French Crusaders were just making contact with the Backfires . The Russian bombers were on afterburner and were nearly as fast as the fighters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the air and were consumed with rage at what had happened , no longer the cool professionals who drove fighters off ships . Only ten Backfires were within their reach .  | They got six of them with their missiles and damaged two more before they had to break off . USS Caron , the senior undamaged ship , tracked the Russians on her radar , calling Britain for fighters to intercept them on the trip home . But the Russians had anticipated this , and detoured far west of the British Isles , meeting their tankers four hundred miles west of Norway . Already the Russians were evaluating the results of their mission . The first major battle of modern carriers and missile-armed bombers had been won and lost . Both sides knew which was which . The fire on Nimitz was out within an hour . With no aircraft aboard , there were few combustibles about , and the ship 's firefighting abilities equaled that of a large city . Toland brought her back to an easterly course . Saratoga was recovering aircraft , refueling them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frigates and a destroyer lingered to recover survivors , as the large ships turned back toward Europe . " All ahead full , " Svenson ordered from his seat on the bridge . " Toland , you all right ? " " No complaints . " No point in it , the ship 's hospital was more than full with hundreds of major injury cases . There was no count of the dead yet , and Toland did n't want to think about that . " You were right , " the captain said , his voice angry and subdued . " You were right . They made it too easy and we fell for it . " " There 'll be another day , Captain . " " You 're Goddamned right there will ! We 're heading for Southampton . See if the Brits can fix anything this big . My regulars are still busy aft . Think you can handle the conn a little longer ?

It was raining again , probably for the last time . The clouds to the southwest were breaking up , and there was a hint of clear sky on the horizon . Edwards just sat there in his helmet and poncho , staring into the distance . " I suppose you 're right , sir , " Smith replied . The sergeant was nervous . They 'd been on this hilltop for almost twenty-four hours , a long time to be stationary in hostile country . The best time to move out would have been during the rain showers , when visibility was cut to a few hundred yards . Soon the sky might be clear again , and it would n't get dark again for quite a while . As it was , they sat on their hilltop in camouflage ponchos that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heavy shower north of them that prevented their seeing Reykjavik , and they could barely make out Hafnarfjordur to the west , which worried the sergeant , who wanted to know what Ivan was up to .

" No , sir , but Ivan is going to start patrolling them soon , and this ai n't a very good place for us to make contact .

We ca n't see very much . " The communications watch officer at Doghouse looked at a weather map . So it really was raining there . He had n't been able to convince his boss that Beagle could be trusted . Edwards had answered the questions that the counterintelligence guys had come up with . They 'd even had a voice-stress analyzer handy to check the tapes of his answers . The needle had pegged on the last answer about his girlfriend . That had n't been faked .

Not a warrior type , the psychological profile said . How long would the kid last ? KEFLAVIK , ICELAND One MiG-29 was flying . The others were in the hardened shelters the Americans had only just finished at the end of runway eleven . The fighter 's mission was twofold . It was a standing combat air patrol aircraft should an incoming raid be detected , but more importantly , it was being tracked carefully by the ground radar controllers : their radar needed to be calibrated . Iceland 's irregular terrain made for troublesome radar performance , and as with the surface-to-air missiles , the instruments themselves had been badly jostled by the trip aboard the Fucik . The fighter flew circles around the airport while the radar operators determined that what their instruments told them was correct . The fighters were fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . At the moment , the howsers were fueling the Badger bomber that had given the lighters navigational and electronic support . Soon it would he  | leaving to bring in nine more . The Air Force detachment was rapidly finishing their job of clearing the airfield . All but one of the runways was swept clear of fragments now . The remains of the American aircraft had been bulldozed off the pavement . The fuel pipeline would be repaired in an hour , the engineers said . " Quite a busy day , " the major said to the fighter commander . " It 's not over yet . I 'll feel better when we get the rest of the regiment in , " the colonel observed quietly . " They should have hit us already . " " How do you expect them to attack ? " The colonel shrugged . " Hard to say . If they 're really serious about closing this field , they 'll use a nuclear warhead . " " Are you always so optimistic , Comrade Colonel ? " The raid was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louisiana ten hours before and landed to refuel at Sondrestrom Air Force Base on Greenland 's west coast . Fifty miles ahead of them were a single Raven * The radar was about halfway calibrated , though what had been done was the easy part . The fighter that had just landed had flown racetrack ovals from due north around the western horizon to due south of Keflavik . The area to the west of the air base , though not exactly flat , was nearly so , with low rocky hills . Next came the hard part , plotting radar coverage of the eastern arc over Iceland 's mountainous center , a solid collection of hills that worked up to the island 's tall central peak . Another Fulcrum rolled off the runway to begin this task , its pilot wondering how long it might take to map all the nulls  --  areas blanked to radar coverage by the steep valleys  --  areas that an attacking aircraft could use to mask its approach to Keflavik . The radar officers were plotting probable troublesome spots on their topographical maps when an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just turned to hash from powerful electronic jammers . That could mean only one thing . The klaxons sounded in the fighter shelters at the end of runway eleven . Fighter pilots who had been dozing or playing dominos jumped to their feet and raced ( o their aircraft . The tower officer lifted the field phone to give more exact warning to the fighters , then called up the missile battery commander : " Incoming air raid ! " Men leaped into action all across the air base . The fighter ground crews hit the built-in self-starters , turning the jet engines even as the pilots climbed into the cockpits . The SAM battery turned on its search and fire-control systems while the launch vehicles stewed their missiles into firing position . Just under the radar horizon , eighteen t3-52 bombers had just lit off their  | ECM jamming systems . They were deployed in six groups of three each . The first skimmed over the top of Mt . Snaefells , sixty miles north of Keflavik , and the rest came from all around the west side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic noise provided by their own systems and the supporting EF-111 Raven jammer . The Russian fighter just lifting off climbed to altitude , the pilot keeping his radar off as he scanned the sky visually , waiting for intercept information from the ground-based radar . His comrades were even now taxiing into the open , racing straight down the runway and into the sky . The aircraft that had just landed taxied to a fuel bowser , its pilot gesturing and cursing at the ground crewmen who were struggling to fuel his fighter . In their haste , they spilled ten gallons of fuel over the wing . Amazingly , it did not ignite , and a dozen men ran in with CO2 extinguishers to prevent an explosion as the fighter drank in a full load of fuel . HILL 152 , ICELAND Edwards 's head jerked up at the noise , the distinctive roar of jet fighters . He saw a dark trail of smoke approaching in from the east , and the silhouettes passed within a mile . The shapes were heavy with ordnance , the up-angled wingtips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They 're our guys ! " They were Phantom jets of the New York Air National Guard , configured as Wild Weasel SAM-killers . While Russian attention was on the converging bomber raid , they skimmed over hilltops and down valleys , using the crenelated landscape to mask their low-level approach . The back-seat crewman in each aircraft counted the missile radars , selecting the most dangerous targets . When they got to within ten miles of Keflavik , they popped up high and fired a salvo of Standard-ARM antiradar missiles . The Russians were caught by surprise . Laboring to direct missile fire at the bombers , they did n't expect a two-part raid . The incoming missiles were not detected . Three of the ARMs found targets , killing two search radars and a missile-launch vehicle . One launch commander turned his vehicle around and trained manually on the new threat . The Phantoms jammed his firecontrol radar , leaving behind a series of chaff clouds as they came in at thirty-foot height . As each pilot raced to the target area assigned to him , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAM launcher and streaked toward it , dropping Rockeye cluster-bomb canisters that fell short but spread over a hundred bomblets all over the area . The SA-11 launcher exploded in his wake ; its crew never knew what had happened . A thousand yards beyond it was a mobile antiaircraft gun vehicle . The Phantom engaged it with his own cannon , badly damaging it as he swept across the rest of the peninsula and escaped back over the sea , a cloud of chaff and flares in his  | wake . It was a letter-perfect Weasel mission . All four aircraft were gone before the Soviet missile crews were able to react . The two SAMs that were launched exploded harmlessly in chaff clouds . The battery had lost twothirds of its launcher vehicles and all of its search radars . Three of the mobile guns were also destroyed or damaged . The bombers were now a mere twenty miles out , their powerful ECM jamming systems drowning the Soviet radar with electronic noise . They could not defeat the radar on the mobile guns , however . The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it did n't matter . The guns had been designed to deal with small fighters , and when their radars tried to lock on the huge bombers , they found a target so large that their radar signals traced from one part to another . The computers could not decide what the target range was , and kept recycling automatically , rendering the electronics package useless . The gun crews cursed as one man and switched over to manual fire-control , using their eyes to sight in on the massive incoming targets . The bombers popped up to nine hundred feet now , hoping to avoid the worst of the gunfire and escape without loss . They had not been warned of a possible fighter presence . Their mission was to wreck Keflavik before fighters could get there . Now surprise was on the Soviet side . The Fulcrums dived out of the sun at the bombers . Their own fire-control radars were nearly useless as they approached , but half their missiles were infrared-guided , and the American bombers gave off enough heat to attract the attention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight of three never saw them coming in . Two took missile hits and exploded in midair . The third radioed for fighter cover , jinking his aircraft hard  --  too hard . His second dive bottomed out too late , and the aircraft disintegrated on the ground north of Keflavik in a fireball visible to Edwards thirty miles away . The Russian fighters were experiencing an airman 's dream . All eight aircraft had individual targets , and they split to hunt them singly before Keflavik absorbed too many bomb hits . The bomber crews pressed in on their targets . It was too late to run away , and all they they could do was scream for the fighters to come back and support them . The ground-based gunners joined in . Firing over open sights , a young sergeant hit a bomber just dropping its load . The bomb bay took a dozen rounds , and the aircraft vanished in a deafening explosion that shook the sky and damaged yet another B-52 . One missile-launch crew successfully switched their missile-control systems to the backup infrared mode and fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the bombs were released . The bomber 's wing erupted in flame and the aircraft swooped east trailing a black river of smoke .  | They watched it approach their hill , a wounded monster whose right wing trailed burning fuel . The pilot was trying to maintain altitude so that his crew could eject , but all four of his right engines were gone and the burning wing collapsed . The bomber staggered in the air and dropped , rolling into the west face of Hill 152 . None of the crew escaped . Edwards did n't have to give an order . In five seconds , his men had packed their gear and were running northeast . The remaining bombers were now over the target and screaming for help from their escorting fighters . Eight successfully dropped their bombloads before turning clear of the area . The Soviet fighters had claimed five by now , and the surviving crews were desperate to escape the unexpected hazard . The Russians were now out of missiles , and attempting to engage with their cannon . That was dangerous . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damaged by machine-gun fire from his target and had to break off . The final element of confusion was the return of the American Phantoms . They carried only three Sparrow missiles each , and when they lit off their missile-intercept radars , the Soviet fighters all received warning tones from their defense systems . The Fulcrums scattered before the twelve incoming missiles and dove for the ground . Four dropped down right on top of Edwards ' group , swooping low over a crashed B-52 east of Hafnarfjordur . When they came back up , the sky was clear again . The Phantoms were short on fuel . They could not press their attack and turned away without a single kill . The surviving bombers were now safely hidden in the cloud of jamming . The Soviets re-formed and moved back to Keflavik . Their first impression was a bad one . Fully two hundred bombs had fallen within the airport perimeter , and nine of them had found runway targets . But runway eleven was unscarred . As they watched , the single Fulcrum left on the ground roared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , demanding a vector to a target . He was ordered to patrol as the rest of the squadron landed to refuel . The first battle had mixed results . The Americans lost half their bomber force in return for damaging three of Keflavik 's five runways . The Soviets had most of a SAM battery smashed to little gain , but Keflavik was still usable . Already the ground personnel were running to the runway-repair equipment left behind by the Americans . At the end of each runway was a pile of gravel , and a half-dozen bunkers contained steel mats . Heavy equipment would bulldoze the debris back into the holes , even it out , then cover it over with gravel and steel . Keflavik was damaged , but its runways would be fully operational again before midnight .  | USS PHARRIS " I think this one 's for-real , Captain , " the ASW officer said quietly . The line of colored blocks on the passive sonar display had lasted for seven minutes . Bearing was changing slowly aft , as though the contact were heading for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steaming at twelve knots , and her Prairie/Masker systems were operating . Sonar conditions were better today . A hard thermocline layer at two hundred feet severely impeded the utility of a surface sonar . Pharris was able to deploy her towed-array sonar below it , however , and the lower water temperature there made for an excellent sound channel . Better still , the layer worked in both directions . A submarine 's sonar had as much trouble penetrating the thermocline as a surface sonar . Pharris would be virtually undetectable to a submarine below the layer . " How 's the plot look ? " the tactical action officer asked . " Firming up , " ASW answered . " Still the distance question . Given the water conditions and our known sonar performance , our sonar figure of merit gives us a contact distance of anything from five to fourteen miles on direct path , or into the first convergence zone . That predicts out from nineteen to twenty-three miles ... " A convergence zone is a trick of physics . Sound traveling in water radiates in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water temperature and pressure into a series of curves , rising to the surface , then bending again downward . While the frigate could hear noise out from herself for a distance of about fourteen nautical miles , the convergence zone was in the shape of an annulus  --  the area between two concentric circles  --  a donut-shaped piece of water that began nineteen miles and ended twenty-three miles away . The distance to the submarine was unknown , but was probably less than twenty-three miles . That was already too close . The submarine could attack them or the convoy they guarded with torpedoes , or with surface-to-surface missiles , a technology pioneered by the Soviets . " Recommendation , gentlemen ? " Morris asked . The TAO spoke first . " Let 's put the helicopter up for the near solution , and get an Orion working the far one . " " Sounds good , " ASW agreed . Within five minutes , the frigate 's helo was five miles out , dropping Lofar-type sonobuoys . On striking the water , these miniature passive sonar sets deployed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case all dipped above the thermocline layer to determine if the target was close . The data was relayed back to Pharris 's combat information center : nothing . The passive sonar track , however , still showed a submarine or  | something that sounded like a submarine . The helo began moving outward , dropping sonobuoys as it went . Then the Orion arrived . The four-engine aircraft swooped low along the frigate 's reported bearing-to-target . The Orion carried over fifty sonobuoys , and was soon dropping them in sets both above and below the layer . " I got a weak signal on number six and a medium on number five , " a sonar operator reported . Excitement crept into his voice . " Roger , confirm that , " the tactical coordinator on Bluebird-Three agreed . He 'd been in the ASW game for six years , but he was getting excited , too . " We 're going to start making MAD runs . " " You want our helo to back you up ? " " Roger that , yes , but . tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's SH-2F Sea Sprite helicopter sped off north , her magnetic anomaly detector trailing out by cable from a shroud on the right side of the aircraft . Essentially a highly sensitive magnetometer , it could detect the disturbance in the earth 's magnetic field made by a large chunk of ferrous metal  --  like the steel hull of a submarine . " Signal on number six is now medium-strength . Signal on seven remains medium . " The plotting team took this to mean that the submarine was heading south . " I can give you a working range figure , " ASW said to the TAO . Fortytwo to forty-five thousand yards , bearing three-four-zero to three-three-six . " The frigate relayed this at once to the Orion . As they watched on radar , the P-3C quartered the area , flying very precise tracks across the box of ocean defined by Pharris 's sonar data as the probable location of the submarine . A computer system plotted the lines as they extended to the south . " Pharris , this is Bluebird . Our data indicates no friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Roger that , Bluebird . We confirm no reports of friendlies in the area . " Morris had checked that himself half an hour before . " Signal strength increasing on number six . We now have a weak signal on number five . Number seven is fading out . " The technician was really struggling to be professionally impassive now . " Range is firming up . Estimate target speed roughly eight knots , distance forty-three thousand yards . " " Transient ! Transient ! " called the ship sonar operator . A metallic noise had come from the target bearing . A closing hatch , a dropped tool , an opening torpedo tube door  --  something had made a uniquely man-made sound . " Confirm mechanical transient , copied on buoys five and six , " the aircraft called immediately .  | " Confirmed , " Pharris 's TAO answered . " We got that on the towedarray , too . We evaluate the contact as positive submarine at this time . " " Concur , " the Orion replied . " Positive Redboat classification  --  madman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a MAD contact . " A big spike appeared on the MAD readout . Instantly , a crewman flipped a switch to deploy a smoke marker and the aircraft turned hard right to circle back on the contact point . " Plotted ! " The tactical action officer marked the position on his tactical display scope with a large V symbol . The helo raced in on the contact as the Orion circled back . " Madman ! " its systems operator called out , and the helo dropped its own smoke bomb , slightly south and west of the Orion 's . The data was now being relayed to the frigate 's torpedo-tube and ASROC attack directors . Neither had anything like the range to engage the target , but that could change quickly . " Patience , " Morris breathed from his chair in the CIC , then louder : " Take your time , people . Let 's lock this guy in before we fire . " The Orion 's tactical coordinator agreed , forcing himself to relax and take the time needed . The P-3 and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the Orion got a reading and the helo did not . Another run , and both had the contact 's course line . Next came an east-to-west run . At first , both missed , but on the second run both had him . The contact was no longer an it . Now it was a he , a submarine being driven by a man . Control of the operation now passed exclusively to the tactical coordinator on the Orion . The big patrol aircraft orbited two miles away as the helicopter lined up for the final pass . The pilot made a very careful check of his tactical display , then locked his eyes on the gyrocompass . The helo began the last MAD run , with the Orion two miles behind it . " Madman , madman , smoke away ! " The final smoke marker dropped , a green flare floating on the surface . The Sea Sprite banked hard to the right to clear the area as the Orion came in low . The pilot watched the smoke 's movement to figure wind drift as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bay doors opened . A single Mk-46 ASW torpedo was armed for launch . " Torp away ! " The torpedo dropped cleanly , its braking parachute trailed out of the tail to make sure the weapon entered the water nose down . The Orion also dropped an additional sonobuoy , this time a directional DIFAR . " Strong signal , bearing one-seven-niner . " The torpedo dove to two hundred feet before beginning its circular search . Its high-frequency sonar came on as it reached search depth . Things started happening quickly . The submarine had been oblivious to the activity over her head . She was  | an old Foxtrot . Too old and too noisy for front-line operations , she was there nonetheless , hoping to catch up with the convoy reported to her south . Her sonar operator had noted and reported a possible overhead splash , but the captain was busy plotting the position of the convoy he had been ordered to approach . The torpedo 's homing sonar changed that . Instantly , the Foxtrot went to flank speed , turning hard to the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her cavitating screws was discernible to several sonobuoys and Pharris 's tactical sonar . The torpedo was in ping-and-listen mode , using both active and passive sonar to find its target . As it completed its first circle , the passive receptors in the nose heard the cavitation noises of the submarine and homed in on them . Soon the active sonar pings were reflecting off the submarine 's stem as it dodged left and right trying to get away . The torpedo automatically went to continuous pinging , increasing to maximum speed as it homed in on its target like the remorseless robot it was . The sonar operators on the aircraft and the frigate had the best picture of what was happening . As they watched , the bearing lines of the submarine and torpedo began to converge . At fifteen knots , the Foxtrot was too slow to run away from the forty-knot torpedo . The submarine began a radical series of turns with the torpedo in pursuit . The Mk46 missed its first attempt for a kill by twenty feet , and immediately turned for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead of continuing his left turn , he reversed it , hoping to confuse the oncoming torpedo . He ran directly into its path .. . Immediately overhead , the helicopter crew saw the water appear to leap , then froth , as the shock wave of the explosion reached the surface . " We have warhead detonation , " the pilot reported . A moment later his systems operator dropped a passive buoy . The sound came into them in less than a minute . The Foxtrot was dying . They heard the sounds of air blowing into her ballast tanks and continued flank power from her electric motors , her propellers struggling to overcome the weight of water entering the hull and drive the wounded submarine to the surface . Suddenly the engine sounds stopped . Two minutes later , they heard the metallic scream of internal bulkheads being torn asunder by water pressure as the submarine fell below crush depth . " This is Bluebird . We score that one as a kill . Can you confirm , over ? " " Roger , Bluebird , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and breakup noises . We confirm your kill . " The crewmen cheered , forgetting ecorum that went with duty in CIC . Ml right ! That 's one less to worry about . We 'll give you a big assist on ne , Pharris . Nice job from your sonar folks and the help . Out . " The  | Orion increased power and returned to her patrol station forward of the convoy . " Assist , hell ! " snorted the ASW officer . " That was our contact . We could have dropped the torp on him just as easy as he did . " Morris punched him in the shoulder and went up the ladder to the pilothouse . The bridge crew was all grins . Soon the bosun 's mate would paint half of a red submarine silhouette next to the pilothouse door . It had not struck them yet that they had just helped in the killing of a hundred young men not at all unlike themselves , their lives cut short by the hammering pressure of the North Atlantic . " What 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the starboard beam ! " Morris grabbed his binoculars and raced out the open door . The lookout pointed . A column of black smoke was reaching into the sky from the direction of the convoy . Someone else had just gotten his first kill . USS NIMITZ Toland had never seen so many welding torches operating . Under the supervision of the executive officer and three damage-control experts , crewmen were using acetylene torches to cut away the damaged portions of Nimitz 's flight deck and its supporting steel beams . What had been bad enough became worse on more thorough examination . Six of the enormous frames under the flight deck had been wrecked , and the damage extended two decks below that . A third of the hangar deck was burned out . Most of the planefueling network and all of the ordnance elevators had to be repaired . CIC was gone , and with it all of the computers and communications needed to fight the ship . The arrester wire systems would have to be fully replaced . The main search radar was gone . The list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southampton 's Ocean Dock , a task made doubly hard because of the ship 's induced ten-degree list . Water cascaded from the carrier 's clifflike hull into the harbor while more entered the bilges below . Already a senior Royal Navy repair expert and the chief of the Vosper Ship Repair Yard were aboard , reviewing the damage below and cataloging the material needed to enable the ship to operate again . Captain Svenson watched the messenger lines being shot off to handlers who would secure the ship . He was an angry man , Toland noted . Five hundred of his men known dead , another three hundred wounded , and the count was nowhere near complete . The most grievous losses were in the flight deck crews , many of whose shelters had been immolated by the two Soviet missiles . They would also have to he replaced before Nimitz could sail and fight again .  | " Toland , you 'll be heading to Scotland . " " Excuse me , sir ? " " The air wing is being split . The fighters and Hawkeyes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' northern radar line , and their fighters have taken a beating trying to help the Norwegians out . The Tomcats are already on the way , and we 'll be loading their missiles onto the dock so the Brits can fly them north . I want you to operate with the fighter teams to evaluate what Ivan 's up to with his Badgers , and maybe help our guys to cull off some of the bastards . The attack birds are joining the NATO tactical air reserve for the present . " " When do I leave ? " Toland reflected that he had nothing to pack . The Kingfish had taken care of that , too . His first order of business was to cable his family that he was all right . ICELAND " Doghouse , this is Beagle , and what the hell just happened , over ? " " Beagle , I am authorized to tell you that an attack was just made against Keflavik . " " No kidding , guy . A B-52 just crashed right on our Goddamned hill . Did n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information was evaluated as unconfirmed and was not passed on , Beagle . I did not concur in that . Continue your report . " " I saw four , repeat four , Soviet single-seat aircraft with a twin-rudder configuration . I ca n't be sure of the type , but they had double tails , you copy that ? " " Twin rudders , copy that . Confirm you saw four . " " One-two-three-four , Doghouse . I ca n't arrange them to parade overhead . But if you send bombers in here unescorted again , mister , do n't blame me . " " Any survivors from the crash you saw ? " " Negative . No ' chutes , and no way anyone would have survived the crash . Saw one fireball on the horizon , but I 'm not sure what that was . How did the Weasels do ? " " Ca n't say , Beagle , but thanks for the word on the SAMs . " " You have instructions for me ? " " Your status is being reevaluated now . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , fella . We have to move some before the bad guys send a patrol this way . Out . " The Marines were around him , weapons ready , alert for the patrol or helicopter , or both , that had to be heading their way . Edwards tore off the headset and repacked the radio . " Great , just great , " he muttered . " Let 's move it , people . " They had already jogged a full kilometer from their former home , head-  | ing due east into the uninhabited wasteland that formed this part of the island . Smith kept them on slopes , off the crests and hilltops that could silhouette them against the clearing sky . There was a lake off to their left , with many houses on its western side . They had to be careful here . There was no telling who might note their passing and inform someone of it . They passed under the main power transmission lines at a run , angling south to keep a crest line between them and most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holmshraun lava field , an incredible collection of rocks overlooking Highway 1 , one of Iceland 's two major thoroughfares . There were vehicles on the road heading in both directions . Many of them carried soldiers . " What are we figuring to do now , sir ? " Smith asked pointedly . " Well , Sarge , we got good concealment here . Hell , a guy fifty yards away would have trouble spotting us in this crap . I say we wait for it to get a little dark tonight and get north of the road . Once we get past that , the population thins out  --  at least that 's what the map says . It ought to be fairly safe once we get away from the population centers . " " What will our friends on the other side of that radio say about that ? " " I guess we better find out . " Edwards checked his watch . He was nearly two hours overdue . Doghouse was annoyed with him . " What kept you off the air ? " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we waited around and counted the Russians picking over the wreckage . Listen up , we 're all alone here and that 's a little scary , you know ? " " Understood , Beagle . Okay , we got orders for you . You have a map of the area you 're in ? " " That 's affirm , a one-to-fifty-thousand one . " " Okay , they want you to move to Grafarholt . There 's a hill there . You 're supposed to find a safe place near there and belly-up for further instructions . " " Hey , Doghouse , before we get any farther , what if Ivan starts playing DF games and tries to track us down from our radio transmissions ? " " Okay , about time you asked that . The radio you got is encrypted UHF , single-sideband . That means it 's got thousands of channels , and having him lock into one is not real likely . Second , you have a directional antenna . When you transmit , make sure there 's a hill between you and them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe on that score , too . Happy ? " " It helps . " " How soon can you get to that hill for us ? " Edwards looked at the map . About seven kilometers . A comfortable twohour walk in peacetime , maybe three or four not so comfortable hours , given the terrain here . They 'd have to wait for darkness , detour around a few villages .. . and there was that one other little thing to be concerned about . . . ' " Twelve hours , mininnun. "  | " Roger , understood , Beagle . Copy twelve hours . That 's fine . We 'll be calling for you then . Anything else to report ? " " Some activity on the road below us . Several trucks , Army-type , painted green . A lot of personal vehicles , four-by-fours . No armored stuff , though . " " Okay . Take your time and play it safe . Your mission is to avoid contact and report . We 'll be here if you need us . Out . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his swivel chair . " The lad sounds somewhat rattled , " an intelligence officer commented over his tea . " Not quite SAS material , is he ? " another asked . " Let 's not be too hasty , " said a third . " He 's bright , something of an athlete , and he had the presence of mind to escape when events called for it . Seems a bit high-strung , but given his position that 's understandable , I think . " The first pointed on the map . " Twelve hours to go this little distance ? " " Across hilly , open terrain , with a whole bloody division of paras running about in lorries and BMPs , and with a sun that never sets , what the hell do you expect of four men ? " demanded the fourth , a man dressed in civilian clothes who had been gravely wounded while in the 22nd SAS Regiment . " If that lad had any sense , he 'd have packed it in yesterday . Interesting psychological profile here . If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think he 'll do all right . " USS PHARRIS The convoy had scattered . Toland looked at the radar display , an expanding ring of ships , now beginning to turn back east to reassemble . One merchantman had been sunk , another badly damaged and limping west . Three frigates were trying to locate the submarine that had done the damage . Gallery had gotten a possible contact and fired a torpedo at it , without result . Four helicopters were dropping sonobuoys in hope of reacquiring it , and a half-dozen sonars were pinging away , but so far it looked as though the submarine had evaded the angry escorts . " That was a beautiful approach , " the tactical action officer observed grudgingly . " His only goof was hitting the back end of the convoy . " " His fire control was n't all that great , " Morris said . " They say they had sonar readings on five fish . Figure three targets . Two hits for a kill on one , and a scratch hit on another for damage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon 's work . What 's he doing now , people ? " " How much you want to bet it 's an old nuc boat ' ? " TAO asked . " Their fire-control systems are n't up to current standards , and they ca n't run very fast and still stay covert . He just barely made the intercept , and hit off two  | ships . When they scattered he did n't have the speed to pursue without advertising his position , and he 's too smart for that . " " Then what did he do ? " ASW asked . " He was in close when he launched . Ducked inside the convoy and went deep . Used the noise from the thundering herd to mask himself , then motored off clear ... " " North . " Morris bent over the display . " Most of the merchies went northeast when the scatter order went out . He probably went north to trail , and maybe hope to get another shot in later . What do you think we 're up against ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plus maybe another nuc . The one we killed was probably a Fox . Does n't have the speed to trail the convoy . " The ASW officer looked up . " But a November would . We 're not up against a new nuc . He 'd still be shooting . Call it a November . " " Okay , say he came north at six or seven knots , then turned east hoping to pick us up again tomorrow , say . Where would he be ? " " Right now ... here , sir , " ASW said . He pointed to a spot fifteen miles aft of the frigate . " We ca n't go back after him . " " No , but we can listen for him if he tries to play catchup . " Morris thought hard . The convoy would be altering base course to one-two-zero on the hour to head farther south , away from the suddenly increased threat of Soviet long-range bombers . More time would be needed for them to re-form and establish proper stations . That would allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With all the zigzagging the merchies were doing , their effective speed of advance was only about sixteen knots , and a November might try to catch up with that . " I want the operators to pay particular attention to this sector . Our friend just might be back . " " Call in a P-3 ? " TAO wondered . Morris shook his head . " They want to keep station forward . The main threat is still ahead of us . Us ' cans have to worry about the trailers , until we get a hot contact , anyway . I think this guy will trail , and he might try and get off a contact report . " KIEV , THE UKRAINE " Good news , " the naval officer said . " Our bombers report sinking three aviation ships , two cruisers , and two destroyers . " Alekseyev and his boss exchanged a look : their colleagues in blue would be insufferable now . " How firm is that evaluation ? " CINC-Southwest asked . " There were four carrier-type ships photographed before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack showed only one . Two cruisers and two destroyers were also missing . Finally we have intelligence reports of  | numerous carrier-type aircraft landing at French naval air bases in Brittany . Our submarines were unable to make contact with the formation  --  it would 11 smashing success . We will close the Atlantic for you , Comrades , " the captain predicted . " We may need it closed , " Alekseyev said after the captain left . His boss grunted agreement . Things in Germany were not going well . The Soviet Air Force had been hurt even worse than they had feared , and as a result the land campaign was already far behind schedule . On the second day of the war , the first day 's objectives had been met in only one army 's zone , and that one was being heavily counterattacked twenty kilometers east of Hamburg . Tank losses had been 50 percent higher than predicted , and control of the air was in jeopardy , with many units reporting heavier-thanexpected air attacks . Only half of the Elbe bridges had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not carry all the load of the highway bridges they replaced . The NATO armies had not yet reached their peak strength . American reinforcements were still arriving by air , mating up with their pre-positioned equipment . The Soviet first echelon was being bled , and the second echelon was still largely trapped behind the Elbe . ICELAND " About as dark as it 's gon na get , " Edwards said . The light level was what meteorologists and sailors called nautical twilight . Visibility was down to five hundred yards with the sun just below the northwest horizon . The lieutenant put on his pack and rose . His Marines did the same , with as much enthusiasm as a child on his way to school . They headed down the shallow slope towards the Sudura River , more a fair-sized creek , Edwards thought . The lava field provided good cover . The ground was littered with rocks , some as much as three feet high , a landscape that broke up shapes and disguised movement to the casual observer . He hoped there was nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Soviet patrols , mainly on military trucks that passed through the area at intervals of about thirty minutes . They saw no fixed positions . Certainly they had garrisoned the hydroelectric power station at Burfell , farther east on Route 1 . No one had bombed that yet : the lights were still bright in some of the homes below them . The rocks got smaller as the land changed to a grassy meadow . There had been sheep here recently  --  the smell was unmistakable and the grass was short . Instinctively the men walked in a crouch toward a gravel road . The houses and barns here were spread irregularly . They picked a spot where the space between buildings was about five hundred yards , hoping that the dim light and their camouflage uniforms would make them invisible to any ohseem that one was sunk , unfortunately , but our first naval air battle was a  | server . No one was about in the open . Edwards halted his group and looked carefully through his binoculars at the nearest houses . Lights burned in some , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had imposed a curfew . .. meaning that anyone seen moving might be shot on sight . Happy thought . The riverbanks sloped downward sharply about twenty feet to the water , and were covered with rocks smoothed by years of erosion at high-water time . Smith went down first as the others lay with weapons ready at the lip of the south bank . The sergeant moved slowly at first , checking the water depth before hurrying across , rifle held high in the air . Edwards was surprised how quickly he went through it , then up the far bank . The sergeant waved , and the rest of the men followed . Edwards soon found out why the sergeant had crossed the stream quickly . The waist-deep water was icy cold , like most of the streams on Iceland , fed by melting glaciers . He gasped and went across as fast as he could , his rifle and radio held above his head . A minute later he was atop the far bank . Smith chuckled in the dark . " I guess that woke everybody up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarge , " Rodgers groused . " Looks clear ahead , " Edwards said . " Beyond this meadow is another creek , then the main road , a secondary road , then up a hill into a lava field . Let 's keep moving . " " Right , Lieutenant . " Smith got to his feet and moved off . The others trailed behind him at five-yard intervals . The little bastard 's in a hurry , is n't he ? The ground here was agreeably flat , the grass as high as their boot tops . They moved rapidly , keeping low , weapons held ready across their chests as they angled slightly east to avoid the village of Holmur . The next stream was shallower than the Sudura , though no less cold . They stopped on crossing it , now only two hundred yards from the highway . Again Smith moved off first , this time with his back bent double , moving in rushes followed by pauses while he knelt to examine the terrain repeatedly . The men behind him matched his movements exactly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet from the road . " Okay , " Smith said . " We cross one at a time , a minute apart . I go first . I 'll stop fifty feet on the other side by those rocks . When you cross , do n't screw around  --  run and keep low , and come to me . If you see something coming , get as far from the road as you can and drop . They ca n't see you if you lay still , people . Take things real easy . Okay ? " Everyone , Edwards included , nodded agreement . The sergeant was as good as his word . After a final look to be sure that nothing was moving in their direction , he raced off across the road , his personal gear flopping and slapping against his body as he did so . They waited a minute , then Garcia followed . After another minute , Rodgers went .  | Edwards counted to sixty and darted forward . The lieutenant was amazed ? and appalled  --  at how stressful this was . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he froze dead in the center . Automobile lights were approaching them from the north . Edwards just stood there , watching them come closer " Move your ass , Lieutenant ! " the sergeant 's voice rasped at him . The lieutenant shook his head clear and ran to the sound of the sergeant 's voice , one hand holding his helmet in place on his head . " Lights coming down ! " he gasped . " No shit . Be cool , sir . People , let 's get spread out . Find some good cover and freeze . And make Goddamned sure those weapons are on safe ! You stay with me , sir . " The two privates moved left and right into tall weeds , disappearing from view as soon as they stopped moving . Edwards lay next to Sergeant Smith . " You think they saw me ? " The darkness prevented him from seeing the angry expression accompanying Smith 's reply : " Prob'ly not . Do n't freeze in the road like that again , sir . " " I wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my thing . " " Just listen and learn what we tell ya ' , okay ? " Smith whispered . " We 're Marines . We 'll take good care of you . " The lights approached slowly , proceeding down the steep grade to their north . The driver did n't trust the loose gravel surface . The north-south road split here , forking left and right to Route 1 . It had to be a military truck , they saw . The lights were rectangular , taped slips over headlights installed at the Soviets ' massive Kama River factory , built largely with Western aid . The truck stopped . Edwards did not allow himself to react , except that his grip tightened on the plastic stock of his rifle . What if someone had seen them cross the road and telephoned the Russians ? Smith 's hand reached out and pushed the lieutenant 's rifle down . " Let 's be careful with that , Lieutenant , " Smith whispered . The ten men in the truck dismounted and spread into the grass off the road , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they carried weapons or not . Each man stopped , and almost in unison they unbuttoned their flies to urinate . Edwards gawked and nearly laughed . Finished , they moved back to the truck , which started up and proceeded west on the fork to the main road , motoring off with the sound on a poorly muffled diesel engine . The Marines re-formed as the truck 's taillights dipped under the horizon . " Too bad . " Rodgers smiled in the semidarkness . " I coulda blow 'd one guy 's pecker right off ! " " You done good , people , " Smith said . " Ready to move out , Lieutenant ' ' "  | " Yeah . " Shamed by his performance , the lieutenant let Smith lead them off . They crossed the gravel road and a hundred yards later were in yet another lava field , climbing over rocks into the wasteland . Their wet fatigue pants clung to their legs , drying slowly in the cool westerly breeze . USS PHARRIS " Our friend the November does n't have an anechoic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display . " I think that 's him , running to catch up with the convoy . " " We have this trace plotted at about forty-six thousand yards , " the tactical action officer said . " Get the helo up , " Morris ordered . Five minutes later , Pharris 's helicopter was running southwest at full speed , and Bluebird-Seven , another P-3C Orion , was closing on the datum point from the east . Both aircraft flew low , hoping to surprise the submarine that had killed one of their flock and gravely damaged another . The Russian had probably made a mistake by increasing his speed . Maybe he had orders to trail the convoy and radio data for other submarines to use . Maybe he wanted to catch up to make another attack . Whatever the reason , his reactor pumps were running and making noise that his hull could not contain . His periscope was up , and that gave the aircraft a chance to spot him with their look-down radars . The helo was closer , and its pilot was communicating with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textbook attack if things worked out right . " Okay , Bluebird , we are now three miles from datum center . Say your position . " " We 're two miles behind you , Papa-One-Six . Illuminate ! " The systems operator flipped the cover off the radar switch and moved it from Standby to Active . Instantly , energy began to radiate from the radar transmitter slung under the helicopter 's nose . " Contact , we have a radar contact bearing one-six-five , range eleven hundred yards ! " " Stream the MAD gear ! " The pilot advanced his throttles to race toward the contact . " We got him , too , " the Tacco called swiftly . The petty officer beside him armed a torpedo , setting its initial search depth for a hundred feet . The helicopter 's anticollision lights came on , the red lights flashing in the darkness . No sense in hiding their approach now . The sub must have detected their radar signals and would now be attempting a crash dive . But that took more time than he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the systems operator screamed . The smoke was invisible in the darkness , but the short green flame was an  | unmissable beacon in the darkness . The helo banked left , clearing the way for the Orion now only five hundred yards behind him . The P-3C 's powerful searchlights came on , spotting the telltale wake left by the now-invisible periscope . The MAD contact had been right on , the pilot saw at once . The Orion 's bomb doors swung open and the torpedo dropped toward the black waters along with a sonobuoy . " Positive sonar contact , evaluate as submarine ! " a sonar-board operator said over the intercom . The tone lines displayed on his screen were exactly what a November at high speed looked like , and the torpedo chasing her was already on continuous pinging . " Torpedo is closing the target rapidly .. . Looks good , Tacco , closing . . . closing  --  impact ! " The torpedo 's sound tracing merged with that of the submarine , and a brilliant splotch appeared in the waterfall display . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recording the recurring rumbles of the torpedo warhead explosion . The submarine 's screw sounds stopped , and again he heard the sound of blowing air that quickly stopped as the submarine began her last dive . " That 's a kill , that 's a kill ! " exulted the Tacco . " Confirm the kill , " Morris said over the radio . " Nice job , Bluebird . That was a real quick-draw ! " " Roger , copy , Pharris . Thank you , sir ! Beautiful job with the helo and the detection , guy . You just got another assist . Hell , we might just orbit you for a while , Captain , looks like you got all the action . Out . " Morris walked to the corner and poured himself a cup of coffee . So , they had just helped to kill a pair of Soviet submarines . The TAO was less enthusiastic . " We got a noisy old Foxtrot and a November who did something dumb . You suppose he had orders to trail and report , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Morris nodded . " If Ivan 's making his skippers do things like that  --  well , they like central control , but that can change if they find out it 's costing them boats . We learned that lesson ourselves once . " USS CHICAGO McCafferty had his own contact . They had been tracking it for over an hour now , the sonar operators struggling to discern random noise from discrete signal on their visual displays . Their data was passed to the fire-control tracking party , four men hovering over the chart table in the after corner of the attack center . Already the crew was whispering , McCafferty knew . First the yard fire before they were commissioned . Then being pulled out of the Barents Sea at the wrong time . Then being attacked by a friendly aircraft . .. was Chicago an unlucky boat ? they wondered . The chiefs and officers would  | work to dispel that thought , but the chiefs and officers held it , too , since all sailors believed in luck , an institutional faith among submariners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , a famous submarine admiral once said . McCafferty had heard that story often enough . He had so far been devoid of luck . The captain moved back to the chart table . " What 's happening ? " " Not much in the way of a bearing change . He has to be way out there , skipper , like the third convergence zone . Maybe eighty miles . He ca n't be closing us . We would have lost the signal as he passed out of the zone . " The executive officer was showing the strain of the past week 's operations , too . " Captain , if I had to guess , I 'd say we 're tracking a nuclear sub . Probably a noisy one . Acoustical conditions are pretty good , so we have three CZs to play with . And I 'd bet he is doing the same thing we are , patrolling a set position . Hell , he could be running back and forth on a racetrack pattern , same as us . That would account for the minimal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only real contact he 'd had since the war started . He was close to the northern border of his patrol area , and the target was probably just on the other side of it . Going after it meant leaving the bulk of his assigned sector unprotected .. . " Let 's go after him , " McCafferty ordered . " Left ten degrees rudder , come left to new course three-five-one . All ahead two thirds . " Chicago rapidly turned to a northerly heading , accelerating to fifteen knots , her maximum " silent " speed . At fifteen knots the submarine radiated only a small amount of noise . The risk of counterdetection was slight , since even at this speed her sonars could detect a target five to ten miles off . Her four tubes were loaded with a pair of Mk-48 torpedoes and two Harpoon antiship missiles . If the target was a submarine or a surface ship , Chicago could handle it . GRAFARHOLT , ICELAND " You 're early , Beagle , " Doghouse replied . Edwards was sitting between two rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his knee . He hoped it was pointing in a safe direction . The Russians , he figured , were strung mostly along the coast from Keflavik to Reykjavik , well to the west of the direction to the satellite . But there were houses and factories below him , and if they had a listening post down there . . . " We had to get here before it got too light , " the lieutenant explained . They had run the last kilometer with the rising sun behind them . Edwards took some small comfort in the fact that the Marines were puffing harder than he was . " How secure are you ? "  | " There is some movement on the road below us , but that 's a good ways off , maybe a mile . " " Okay , you see the electrical switching station southwest of you ? " Edwards got out his binoculars with one hand to check . The map called the place Artun . It held the main electrical transformers for the power grid on this part of the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the feeder cables radiated out from this point . " Yeah , I see it . " " How are things going , Beagle ? " Edwards almost said they were going great , but stopped himself . " Lousy . Things are going lousy . " " Roger that , Beagle . You keep an eye on that power station . Anything around it ? " " Stand by . " Edwards set down the antenna and gave the place a closer look . Aha ! " Okay , I got one armored vehicle , just visible around the corner on the west side . Three  --  no , four armed men are in the open . Nothing else that I can see . " " Very good , Beagle . Now you keep watch on that place . Let us know if any SAMs show up . We also want data if you see any more fighters . Start keeping records of how many trucks and troops you see , where they 're heading . Be sure to write things down . Got that ? " " Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Good . You 're doing all right , Beagle . Your orders are to observe and report , " Doghouse reminded them . " Avoid contact . If you see enemy troops heading in your direction , bug out . Do n't worry about calling in , just bug the hell out and report when you can . Now get off the air for a while . " " Roger that . Out . " Edwards repacked the radio . It was getting so that he could do it with his eyes closed . " What gives , Lieutenant ? " Smith asked . The lieutenant grunted . " We sit tight and watch that electrical place off that way . " " You s'pose they want us to turn some lights off ? " " There 's too many troops down there , Sarge , " Edwards replied . He stretched and opened his canteen . Garcia was on guard atop the knoll to his right , and Rodgers was asleep . " What 's for breakfast ? " " Well , if you got peanut butter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Edwards ripped open the C-Ration container and inspected the contents . " Deal . "  | Ripostes USS CHICAGO The submarine slowed to reacquire the target . She 'd run deep at fifteen knots for over an hour , and now reduced speed and came up to five hundred feet , right in the middle of the deep sound channel . McCafferty ordered an easterly course , which allowed the towed-array sonar  --  his " tail " ? to bear on the supposed target to the north . It took several minutes before the array was straight and aligned in the proper direction so that the sonar operators could begin their work in earnest . Slowly the data came up on their displays , and a senior petty officer plugged in a set of headphones , hoping for an aural detection . There was nothing to detect . For twenty minutes the screen showed only random noise patterns . McCafferty examined the paper plot . Their erstwhile contact would now be exactly two convergence zones away and should have been easily detected , given known water conditions . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a classification . " The executive officer shrugged . " He 's gone . " " Take her up to antenna depth . Let 's see what 's cooking topside . " McCafferty moved back to the periscope pedestal . He could not fail to note the instant tension in the compartment . The last time they 'd done this , they 'd nearly been sunk . The submarine leveled off at a depth of sixty feet . Sonar did another check and found nothing . The ESM mast went up , and the electronics technician reported only weak signals . The search periscope went up next . McCafferty made a very quick check of the horizon  --  nothing in the air , nothing on the surface .  | " There 's a storm to the north , line squall , " he said . " Down scope . " The executive officer grumbled an inaudible curse . The noise from the storm would make the normally difficult task of finding a conventional sub motoring along on battery power nearly impossible . It was one thing for them to dart a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance for a kill . It was another to leave for a whole day looking for something that they might never find . He looked at the captain , waiting for the decision to be made . " Secure from general quarters , " McCafferty said . " XO , take us back to station at ten knots . Keep her deep . I 'm going to take a nap . Wake me in two hours . " The captain walked a few steps forward to his stateroom . The bunk was already folded down , unmade , from the portside bulkhead . Instrument repeaters would show him course and speed , and a TV set could show him whatever the periscope might be looking at , or a taped movie . McCafferty had been awake for about twenty hours now , and the added stress that comes from a combat environment made it feel like a week . He took off his shoes and lay down , but sleep would not come . KEFLAVIK , ICELAND The colonel ran his hand along the bomber silhouette painted on the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gun cameras . Not since a handful of his comrades had fought in the skies of North Vietnam had a Soviet Air Force pilot won a real air-to-air victory , and this one had been over a nuclear-capable bomber that might otherwise have threatened the homeland . There were now twenty-five MiG-29 fighters on Iceland , and four of them were aloft at all times to protect the bases as the ground troops tightened their control of the island . The B-52 raid had hurt them . Their main search radar was slightly damaged , but another was being flown out today , a more modern , mobile unit whose position would be changed twice a day . He wished they had an airborne radar , but learned that losses over Germany had severely limited their availability . The news of the air war there was not good , though the two regiments of MiG-29s were doing well . The colonel checked his watch . In two hours he would be leading a squadron escorting a small force of Backfires that was searching for a convoy . GRAFARHOLT , ICELAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aircraft sitting on the runways at Reykjavik . They all got red stars on them . They have twin-rudder configuration and appear to he armed with air-to-air missiles . Two SAM launchers ,  | and some kind of gun  --  looks like a Gatling gun  --  mounted on a tracked vehicle . " " That 's a Zulu-Sierra-Uniform Three-Zero , Beagle . They 're very bad news . We want to know all about those bastards . How many of them ? " " Only one , located on the grassy triangle a few hundred yards west of the terminal building . " " Are the fighters together or dispersed ? " " Dispersed , two on each runway . There 's a small van with each pair , plus five or six soldiers . I estimate a hundred troops here , with two armored vehicles and nine trucks . They 're patrolling the airport perimeter , and there are several machine-gun emplacements . The Russians also seem to be using the local short-haul airliners for moving troops around . We 've seen soldiers boarding the little twin-prop birds . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Russian chopper since yesterday . " " How 's Reykjavik city look ? " Doghouse asked . " It 's hard to see into the streets . We can look down a valley towards the airport , but we can only see down a few streets . One armored vehicle is visible in there parked , like , at an intersection . Troops are just hanging around , like cops or something at every intersection we can see . If I had to guess , I 'd say most of their troops are around Reykjavik and Keflavik . Not many civilians around , and almost no civilian traffic . There 's a lot of movement on the main roads , both along the coast to our west , and also east on Route 1 . It 's all back-and-forth traffic , like they 're patrolling . We 've counted a total of fifty-some trips , split about even on the two highways . One other thing . We saw some Russians using a civilian vehicle . We have n't seen a jeep yet , except a few of ours on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind , I mean  --  right ? I think they 've commandeered the people 's four-by-fours . That 's practically the national vehicle here , and a lot of them are moving around on the roads . " " Any more incoming transport flights ? " " Five . We have clear skies , and we can watch them going in towards Keflavik . Four were IL-76s , and the other one looked kind of like a C-130 . I do n't know the designation for that one . " " Are the fighters flying ? " " We saw one take off two hours ago . I 'd say they have a patrol up , and have fighters here and Keflavik both . That 's a guess , but I 'll bet money on it . I 'd also say the fighters we 're looking at can roll off in less than five minutes . Looks a lot like a hot-pad alert status . " " Okay , copy that , Beagle . How is your situation ? " " We 're pretty well concealed , and the sarge has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians beat any bushes yet . Mostly they seem to he hanging in populated areas and on the roads . If they start heading this way , we 'll he bugging out . "  | " Exactly right , Beagle . We will probably be ordering you off that hill soon anyway . You 're doing good , boy . Hang in there . Out . " SCOTLAND " The kid 's doing all right , " the major said . He was in an awkward position ? an American officer in a NATO communications post run by Brit intelligence types who were evenly split on Edwards 's reliability . " I 'd say he 's doing bloody marvelously , " nodded the senior Brit . He 'd lost an eye , quite some time ago by the look of it , but was still one toughlooking bastard , the major thought . " Notice how he discriminates between what his observations and opinions are . " " Weather forecaster , " snorted another . " We must get some professionals in there . How quickly can we whistle some up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put them in by submarine , though , and I agree . A bit dicey for a parachute infiltration , you know . Iceland 's covered with rocks , the place is made to break ankles and legs . Then there 's the Soviet fighters . No hurry on putting troops there , is it ? We 've got to reduce their air assets first and generally make life as difficult for them as we can . " " That starts tonight , " the major said . " Nordic Hammer Phase Two will hit around the local sunset time . " " Hope it works better than Phase One did , old boy . " STORNOWAY , SCOTLAND " So how are things going up here ? " Toland asked his Royal Air Force counterpart . Right before boarding the flight he 'd sent the telegram to Marty : I 'M ALL RIGHT . ON THE BEACH FOR A WHILE . LOVE . He hoped that would reassure her . Probably the news of the carrier battle was already in the papers . " Could be better . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're about down to a bare minimum for local defense , and Ivan 's begun to attack our northern radar installations . Sorry about what happened to your aircraft carrier , but I must say we 're very happy indeed to have you chaps with us for a bit . " Nimitz 's interceptors and radar birds were split among three RAF bases . The maintenance crews were still arriving by transport aircraft , and some hitch had developed with the missiles , but the F-14s each carried a full load for one engagement , and they could use RAF Sparrows to reload . Operating off a land base , the fighter could carry a larger load of fuel and ordnance , packing a heavier punch than off a ship . The fighter crews were in a foul humor . Having used their aircraft and precious missiles to kill drones , they  | had returned to the formation to see the fearful results of the mistake . The total loss of life was still uncertain , but scarcely two hundred men had escaped from Saipan , and only a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bloodiest defeat in the history of the United States Navy , with thousands of men gone and not a single kill to offset the losses . Only the French had scored against the Backfires , succeeding with twenty-year-old Crusaders where the vaunted Tomcats had failed . Toland sat in on their first briefing , conducted by the RAF . The fighter pilots were absolutely silent . He had trouble gauging their mood . No jokes . No whispered remarks . No smiles . They knew that the error had not been theirs , that it was not their fault at all , but that did n't seem to matter . They were shaken by what had happened to their ship . As was he . Toland 's mind kept coming back to the image of the fourinch-thick flight deck steel bent into the sky like cellophane , a blackened cavern below it where the hangar deck used to be . The rows of bags ? crewmen who had died aboard the world 's most powerful warship .. . " Commander Toland ? " An airman tapped him on the shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The two men walked to the operations room . Bob noted instantly that a new raid was being plotted . The operations officer , a flight lieutenant , motioned for Toland to join him . " One regiment , perhaps less . One of your EP-3s is snooping up there and caught their radio chatter while they were refueling north of Iceland . They 'll be going for one of these convoys , we think . " " You want the Tomcats to ambush them on the way home ? The timing 's going to be tricky . " " Extremely . Another complication . They will use Iceland as a navigational check and a secure assembly point . We know Ivan has fighters there , and now it 's reported that he has fighters operating from these two airfields on Iceland . " " Is the source for this something called Beagle ? " " Ah , you 've heard about that one . Yes . " " What kind of fighters ? " " Twin tails , is what your chap reported . Could be MiG-25s , - 29s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " The others are interceptors . Did n't the B-52s get a look at them ? " The briefing he 'd just left had gone over the Air Force mission against Keflavik . More good news to cheer the troops up . " Evidently not a good one , and superficially they are quite similar . I agree they 're probably Fulcrums , and the sensible thing for Ivan to do is have the fighters establish a safe corridor for his bombers . " " They might have to tank coming back ... go for the tankers ? " " We 've thought of that . But they have a million square miles of ocean to use . " The area on the chart was obvious . " The timing for that will he damned  | near impossible , but we think it would be worth the effort some time in the future . For the moment our primary concern is air defense . After that , we think Ivan may be planning an amphibious operation for Norway . If his surface fleet sorties , it 's our job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , skipper , " the executive officer said . " There 's about twentyfive Backfires downbound , target unknown . " " Well , they wo n't be going after the carrier group , not with twenty-five aircraft now that they 're under NATO fighter cover . Where are they now ? " " Probably over Iceland . Three to five hours off . We 're not the biggest convoy in range , but we are the most exposed . " " On the other hand , if they go for all those independents out there , they can hunt undefended ships in open ocean . But I would n't . Our ships are carrying war materiel ... " The convoy had only five SAM-equipped ships . A ripe target . GRAFARHOLT , ICELAND " Contrails , Doghouse , we have contrails overhead , looks like twenty or so . Passing overhead right now . " " Can you get an ID ? " " Negative . Large aircraft with no engines visible on the wings , but I ca n't be sure of the type . They 're pretty high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either  --  no sonic booms , though if they were busting Mach 1 , we should have heard it by now . " " Repeat your count , " Doghouse ordered . " I count twenty-one sets of contrails , two-one sets , heading about oneeight-zero . All the fighters at Reykjavik lifted off and went north about thirty minutes before they passed overhead . They still have n't landed back here yet , but we do not know where they are . The bombers do not appear to be escorted . Nothing else new to report . " " Roger , Beagle . Let us know when the fighters land . Might be nice to get a feel for their cycle time . Out . " The major turned to his sergeant . " Get that one out on the printer right now . Confirm the one-regiment Backfire raid downbound , over Reykjavik right now , estimated course one-eight-zero . Possibly with fighter escort . . . yeah , better put that in , too . " The NATO communications center was about the only thing working as planned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equator were supplying information to units all over the world , and here in Scotland was one of the main " nodes , " military parlance for a hightech telephone exchange .  | USS PHARRIS A good day for contrails , Morris saw . Just the right mixture of temperature and humidity at high altitude , it would cause condensation in the hot exhaust from aircraft engines . They could see the tracks of air traffic crossing the Atlantic . The big twenty-power binoculars usually kept on the bridge wings for surface lookout work had been moved to the flying bridge atop the forward superstructure , and his lookouts were using them to identify the aircraft . They were mainly looking for Bears , the Soviet search aircraft that scouted targets for the Backfires . Everyone was tense , and no relief was in sight . The submarine threat was bad enough , but with the carrier group savaged the day before , the convoy was virtually naked to air attack . They were too far at sea for any hope of land-based fighter protection . Pharris had only the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of no use whatever to anyone else . The ships equipped with surface-to-air missiles were now assembling in line on the north side of the convoy , twenty miles south of the frigate , while Pharris continued her antisubmarine search . All the frigate could do was keep watch on her threat-warning instruments and radio any data developed . They were sure that Ivan would be using his own Big Bulge search radars aboard the Bears to locate and classify the target . The convoy commander 's plan was to use the SAM-ships as an additional row of targets , formed up just like the merchantmen . With luck , an especially curious Bear might mistake them for unarmed ships and be lured in for a visual search . A long shot , it was the only card they had to play .. . " Contact ! We have a Big Bulge radar bearing zero-zero-nine . Signal strength is low . " " Miss us , you bastard , " the tactical action officer breathed . " Not much chance of that , " Morris said . " Get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a southerly heading , using its radar only two minutes out of every ten as it approached the convoy . Soon another was detected slightly to the west . Plotting teams estimated their positions , and a report was sent via satellite to CINCLANTFLT in Norfolk with an urgent request for assistance . Norfolk receipted their message ; ten minutes later they learned that no help was available . Pharris manned her gun mount . The point-defense missile system and Gatling gun radar aft were switched to standby . Other radar was kept off . The radar operators in the combat information center sat nervously at their posts , lingering their switches while listening to the ESM reports and stealing an occasional look at the plot . " Both of them probably have us now . "  | Morris nodded . " Next come the Backfires . " The captain thought of the battles he had studied at the naval academy early in World War II , when the Japanese fleet had had air superiority , or when the Germans had used long-range Condors to circle convoys , radioing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Allies back then could do about . He 'd never expected to be in the same fix . The same tactical situation repeating itself after forty years ? It was absurd , Morris told himself . Absurd and terrifying . " We have a visual sight on a Bear , just over the horizon at two-eightzero , " the talker said . " Director , use your optics to track the target aft , " the tactical action officer said at once . He looked over to Morris . " Maybe he 'll fly close enough for a shot . " " Do n't light off any radars just yet . He might just wander into somebody 's missile envelope if he 's not careful . " " No way he 'll be that dumb . " " He will try to evaluate the convoy defenses , " Morris said quietly . " He ca n't have them visually yet , not quite yet . Then for a while all he 'll be able to see is bumps with wakes behind them . Not easy to identify a ship from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious this guy is ... " " Aircraft just changed course , " the talker reported . " Turning east towards us . " Air action starboard ! Right standard rudder . All ahead full ! Come to new course one-eight-zero , " Morris ordered immediately . He turned south to lure the Bear closer to the SAM ships . " Illuminate the target . Weapons free ! Engage when he gets within range . " Pharris heeled hard to the left as she changed course . Forward , the fiveinch gun mount rotated clockwise as the ship brought her stern across the target bearing . As soon as the gun mount was unmasked , fire-control radars gave it a target solution , and the long-barrel gun elevated to thirty degrees and locked on the target . The point-defense missile mount on the fantail did the same . " Target is at thirty thousand feet , range fifteen miles and closing . " The escort commander still had not authorized a missile launch . Better to have Ivan shoot his missiles first , before he knew what lay in his path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fleet . The big Russian air-tosurface missiles were not especially hard targets to hit , since they ran straight for their targets , though you did have to react in a hurry : they were mighty fast . He figured that the Bear was still doing a target evaluation and did not yet know the strength of the escort force . The longer he was kept in the dark , the better , because the Backfires would not have much time to loiter this far from their bases . And if the Bear came in just a little closer . . . " Commence firing ! " the TAO shouted .  | Pharris 's gun mount went to full-automatic mode , firing a round every two seconds . The Bear was barely within range of her gun , and there was scant chance of a kill , but it was time to give him something to worry about . The first five rounds fell short , exploding harmlessly a mile from the Bear , but the next three came closer , one exploding only two hundred yards from his left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was a mistake . He did n't know that the nearest row of " merchantmen " carried missiles . Seconds later , two missiles launched and the Bear immediately dove to evade , a shower of chaff in her wake as she headed right for Pharris , which gave the frigate 's gun crew another chance to score a kill . They fired off twenty new rounds as the plane approached . Perhaps two were close enough to damage the bomber , but there was no visible result . The missiles came in next , tiny white darts trailing columns of gray smoke . One missed and detonated in the chaff cloud , but the second detonated a hundred yards away from the bomber . The warhead expanded explosively like a watchspring , breaking into thousands of fragments , and several ripped into the Bear 's port wing . The massive propjet lost power in one engine and suffered major wing damage before the pilot regained control just outside Pharris 's gun range . She headed off north , trailing smoke . The other Bear remained discreetly out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lesson that he 'd pass on to his regimental intelligence officer . " More radars coming on . Down Beats ! " warned the ESM technician . " I count ten  --  count is increasing . Fourteen  --  eighteen ! " the air-search radar operator sang out next . " Radar contacts , bearing zero-three-four , range one-eight-zero miles . I count four targets , now five  --  six targets . Course two-one-zero , speed six hundred knots . " " Here come the Backfires , " TAO said . " Radar contact ! " came the next call . " Vampire ! Vampire ! We have inbound missiles . " Morris cringed inwardly . The escorts all switched on their radar transmitters . Missiles trained out on the incoming targets . But Pharris was not part of that game . Morris ordered his ship to flank speed , turning north to race away from the missiles ' probable target area . " The Backfires are turning back . The Bear is holding position . We have some radio chatter . Now twenty-three inbound missiles . Bearing changing on all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed for the convoy . Looks like we 're in the clear . " Morris could hear the crew in the Combat Information Center take one deep collective breath . Ile watched the radar display with marginal relief . The missiles were streaking in from the northeast , and the SAMs were  | coming up to meet them . The convoy was again ordered to scatter , the merchantmen racing away from the center of the target . What followed had an eerie resemblance to an arcade game . Of the twenty-three Soviet-launched missiles , nine broke through the SAMs and dove into the convoy . They hit seven merchantmen . All seven were lost . Some disintegrated at once under the hammering impact of the thousand-kilogram warheads . The others lingered long enough for their crews to escape with their lives . The convoy had left the Delaware with thirty ships . Only twenty were left , and there was almost fifteen hundred miles of open ocean between them and Europe . GRAFARHOLT , ICELAND Two Backfires ran short of fuel and decided to land at Keflavik . Behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Backfires to clear the runway . Edwards reported it in as a propeller aircraft with a damaged engine . The sun was low over the northwestern horizon , and the Bear gleamed yellow against the cobalt-blue sky . " Stay on the air , Beagle , " Doghouse ordered . Three minutes later , Edwards saw why . This time there was no standoff jamming to warn the Soviets . Eight FB-1ll s swept in over the rocks , southwest from the island 's rocky center . They skimmed down the bottom of Selja Valley in elements of two , their green and gray camouflage making them almost invisible to the fighters circling overhead . The lead pair turned due west , with another pair half a mile behind it . The remaining four went south around Mt . Hus . " Holy shit . " Smith saw them first , two fast-moving tail fins to the south . Just as Edwards found them , the lead aircraft popped up and launched a pair of TV-guided bombs . The wingman did the same , and both attackers turned north . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and all landed within the fence perimeter . As though a single switch had been thrown , every light in view went out . The second pair of Aardvarks roared low over Highway 1 , blazing over the rooftops of Reykjavik to line up on their target . The leader lofted his own smart-bombs , and his wingman broke left for the airport tankfarm on the waterfront . Moments later , the control tower exploded , along with a hangar , and Rockeye cluster-bombs blew the fuel tanks apart . Caught by surprise , the Russian gun and missile crews fired too late . The defense troops at Keflavik were surprised , too , first by the sudden loss of electrical power , then by the bombers , which arrived only a minute later . Here , too , the control tower and hangars were the primary targets , and most came apart under the impact of two-thousand-pound bombs . The second team found two parked Backfires and a missile launch vehicle for their  | Rockeyes to hit , and sprinkled more softball-sized bomblets over the runways and taxiways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with gunfire and missiles chasing them  --  and fighters . Six Fulcrums dove for the retreating Varks , whose protective jammers filled the sky with electronic noise . Free of their ordnance loads , the American bombers blazed away at seven hundred knots , a scant hundred feet over the wavetops , but the Soviet fighter commander would not turn away from this one . He 'd seen what they had done to Keflavik , and he was furious at having been caught unaware despite having his fighters aloft . The Fulcrums had a slight speed advantage and closed the gap slowly . They were over a hundred miles offshore when their missile radars burned through the Americans ' jamming . Two fighters immediately launched missiles , and the American aircraft jinked up , then down to lose them . One FB-11l took a hit and cartwheeled into the sea , and the Soviets were preparing a second volley when their threat receivers came on . Four American Phantoms were waiting in ambush for them . In a moment eight Sparrow missiles were diving toward the Fulcrums . Now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheeled and ran back for Iceland on afterburner . One was felled by a missile , and another damaged . The battle had lasted all of five minutes . " Doghouse , this is Beagle . The electrical station is gone ! The Varks knocked it flat , guy . One hell of a fire at the southwest edge of the airport , and looks like the tower got chopped in half . Two hangars look shot up . I see two , maybe three burning aircraft , civilian types . The fighters got off half an hour ago . Damn , that tank farm is burning like a sonuvagun ! Lots of people running around on the ground below us . " As Edwards watched , a dozen vehicles with headlights blazing ran back and forth over the roads below him . Two stopped a kilometer away and dismounted troops . " Doghouse , I think it 's time for us to leave this hill . " " That 's a roger , Beagle . Head northeast towards Hill 482 . We 'll expect to hear from you in ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Time to leave , sir . " Smith tossed the lieutenant his pack and motioned for the privates to move . " Looks like we can score one for the good guys . " KEFLAVIK , ICELAND The MiGs landed on the still undamaged runway one-eight , the base 's longest . They had barely stopped rolling when ground crews began the process of turning them around for further combat operations . The colonel was surprised to see the base commander still alive . " I low many did you get , Comrade Colonel ? " " Only one , and they got one of mine . Did n't you get anything on radar ? " the colonel demanded .  | " Not a thing . They hit Rejkyavik first . Two groups of aircraft , they came in from the north . The bastards must have flown between the rocks , " the major snarled . He pointed to the big mobile radar that sat in the open between two runways . " They missed it completely . Amazing . " " We must move it . Someplace high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radar , and unless we improve radar warning , this low-level business will eat us up . Find a good hilltop . How badly are our facilities damaged ? " " Many small holes in the runways from these bomblets . We 'll have them all patched in two hours . The loss of the tower will hinder our ability to operate large numbers of aircraft . When we lost electrical power , we lost the ability to move fuel through our pipeline , probably lost the local telephone service . " He shrugged . " We can make adjustments , but it 's a major inconvenience . Too much work , too few men . We must disperse the fighters , and we must make alternate arrangements for fueling . The next target will be the fuel dumps . " " Did you expect this to be easy , Comrade ? " The colonel looked over at the blazing pyres that only thirty minutes before had been a pair of Tu-22M Backfires . The damaged Bear was just touching down . " Their timing was too good . They caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the north coast . Luck , perhaps , but I do not believe in luck . I want ground troops to check for enemy infiltrators around all the airports . And I want better security arrangements . I  --  what the hell is that ? " A Rockeye bomblet lay on the concrete not twenty feet from them . The major took a plastic flag from his jeep and set it near the bomb . " The Americans set some for delayed detonation . My men are already searching for them . Be at ease , Comrade , all your fighters have landed safely . Your dispersal areas are clear . " The colonel drew back a few feet . " What do you do with them ? " " We 've already practiced this . We 'll use a specially fitted bulldozer to push them off the concrete . Some will explode , some wo n't . Those that do not go off of their own accord will be detonated by a marksman with a rifle . " " The tower ? " " Three men were on duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You must excuse me . I have work to do . " The colonel took a last look at the bomblet before walking toward his fighters . He 'd underestimated the major . ICELAND " There 's a light on our hill , " Garcia said . Everyone dropped to the ground . Edwards got next to the sergeant . " Some bastard just lit a cigarette , " Smith observed sourly . He 'd finished  | his last one several hours before and was going through withdrawal symptoms . " Now you see why we 're carrying our trash with us ? " " They 're looking for us ? " Edwards asked . " Figures . That attack was pretty cute . They 'll wonder if the airedales had any help . I 'm surprised they did n't do it sooner . Guess they were pretty busy with other stuff . " " Think they can see us ? " Edwards did n't like that idea . " From two miles ? Pretty dark for that , and if they 're smoking , they 're being pretty casual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to find four guys . Lots of hills to check out on this rock . We want to be careful where we walk . Keep off the ridges , like . Even if they got low-light gear , we wo n't be easy to see if we keep to the valleys . Let 's move it out , troops , and keep low . " USS PHARRIS One last merchant was burning . Her crew had abandoned ship two hours before , but still she burned on the western horizon . More deaths , Morris thought . Only about half of the crews had been saved , and there was n't time for a more careful search . The convoy had sailed without a designated rescue ship . The helicopters had pulled many out of the water , but most of them were still needed to hunt submarines . He held a dispatch saying that Orions out of Lajes had prosecuted and probably killed an Echo-class missile submarine in their path . Some good news , but intelligence reported indications of two more . The loss of Iceland was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet bombers had a clear lane to reach into the trade route . Their submarines were racing through the Denmark Strait even as the NATO navies were trying to position their submarines to re-form the barrier they had lost  --  the barrier upon which the convoys depended . The Air Force and Navy would soon try to rearrange fighter coverage to harass the Backfires , but those measures were all stopgaps . Until Iceland was fully neutralized , or better yet retaken , the Third Battle of the North Atlantic hung in an uneven balance . At the Pacific fleet bases of San Diego and Pearl Harbor , darkened ships stood out to sea . Once in open ocean they all headed south toward Panama .  | Returns USS PHARRIS Things had settled down again . A very relative term : the Backfires were still coming down the gap over Iceland , but they 'd hit another convoy this afternoon , killing eleven merchantmen in the process . All the eastbound convoys were angling south , trading a longer voyage to Europe for reduction of the air threat . As bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already been sunk  --  a routing south at least meant the Soviet bombers could carry only one missile instead of two . The strain was beginning to tell on everyone . Morris 's crew had been " port and starboard " for almost a week now , four hours on duty , four hours off . Sleep patterns had been broken up . People did n't eat proper meals . Crucial maintenance requirements cut into what sleep allocations his men had . On top of that was the knowledge that a submarine or aircraft attack could come at any time . The work was still getting done , but Morris noted that his men were becoming terse and ill-tempered . People were beginning to trip over doorsills , a sure sign of fatigue . More serious mistakes would soon follow . The relationship between fatigue and errors was as certain as gravity . In another day or so he hoped a solid routine would establish itself , something for his men to adjust to . There were signs of this , and his chiefs were telling him not to worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact , possible submarine , bearing zero-zeronine . " " Here we go again , " the conning officer said . For the twenty-fourth time on this voyage , Pharris 's crew raced to battle stations .  | It took three hours this time . No Orions were available for them , and the escorts pooled their helicopters to track down the submarine , all directed by Morris and his CIC crew . This submarine driver really knew his business . At the first suspicion that he had been detected  --  perhaps his sonar had detected a helicopter overhead or heard the splash of a falling sonobuoy  --  he went deep and began a confusing series of sprints and drifts , porpoising over and under the layer , working hard to break contact  --  toward the convoy . This one was n't interested in running away . The submarine disappeared and reappeared on their tactical plot , always closing but never revealing his position clearly enough for a shot . " Gone again , " the antisubmarine-warfare officer said pensively . A sonobuoy dropped ten minutes earlier had detected a weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " This guy 's beautiful . " " And too close , " Morris said . If the submarine was continuing south , he was now at the edge of the frigate 's active sonar range . Up to now , Pharris had not revealed herself . The sub 's captain would know surface ships were about from the presence of the helicopters , but it was n't likely that he suspected a frigate only ten miles south of his position . Morris looked up at the ASW officer . " Let 's update our temperature profile . " Thirty seconds later they dropped a bathythermograph probe . The instrument measured water temperature and reported it to a display in the sonar compartment . Water temperature was the most important environmental condition affecting sonar performance . Surface ships checked it periodically , but a submarine could do it continuously  --  yet another edge that went with a submarine . " There ! " Morris pointed . " The gradient 's a lot stronger now and this guy 's exploiting it . He 's staying out of the deep channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of under it where we expect . Okay .. . The helicopters continued to drop buoys , and the brief glimpses they got were of a target heading south , toward Pharris . Morris waited ten minutes . " Bridge , Combat , left standard rudder , come to new course zero-oneone , " Morris ordered , pointing his ship at the submarine 's estimated position . The frigate was doing five knots , moving quietly on the calm seas . The CIC crew watched the heading readout on the aft bulkhead change slowly from the easterly heading . The tactical display was useless . Confused by many brief reports from sonobuoys , most of which were probably false signals to begin with , the computer-generated estimate for the submarine 's position covered over a hundred square miles . Morris walked over to the paper display in the after corner of the room . " I think he 's right about here . " Morris tapped the chart . " Comments ? " " Running shallow ? That 's contrary to doctrine , " ASW pointed out . So-  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fleet intelligence reports said . " Let 's find out . Yankee-search . " The ASW officer gave the order at once . Yankee-search meant turning on the frigate 's active sonar and hammering the water to find the sub . Morris was taking a chance . If the submarine was as close as he thought , then he was advertising his own ship 's location and inviting a missile attack that his point-defense systems were ill-equipped to stop . The sonar operator watched his screen intently . The first five pings came up blank as the sonar beam swept west-to-east . The next one painted a bright dot on the screen . " Contact  --  positive sonar contact , direct path , bearing zero-one-four , range eleven thousand six hundred yards . Evaluate as probable submarine . " " Nail him , " Morris ordered . The solid-fuel ASROC booster ignited , blasting clear of the ship and curving across the sky with a trail of pale gray smoke . The rocket burned out in three seconds , coasting through the sky like a bullet . A thousand feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , retarded by a parachute in its fall toward the water . " He 's changed course , sir , " the sonar operator warned . " Target is turning and increasing speed . I  --  there 's the fish , we have the torp in the water and pinging . Dropped in pretty close . " The tactical action officer was ignoring this . Three helicopters were converging on the target datum point now . There was a good chance the torpedo would miss , and the task now was to pin the contact down . He ordered a right turn , allowing the frigate 's passive sonar array to track in on the submarine , which was moving swiftly now to evade the torpedo , and making a lot of noise . The first helicopter arrived and dropped a buoy . " Twin screws and cavitation noise . Sounds like a Charlie at full speed , sir , " a petty officer announced . " I think the torp may have him . " The torpedo switched from ping-and-listen to continuous pinging , chasing after the racing submarine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she passed through the thermocline layer , then reacquired when it too entered the colder deep water , rapidly closing the distance . The submarine loosed a noisemaker , but it malfunctioned . Another was loaded into the launcher . Too late . The torpedo struck the submarine on her port screw and exploded . " All right ! " hooted a petty officer on the sonar crew . " We have warhead detonation . We got the sucker ! " " We have impact . We have detonation , " confirmed a helo crew . " Stand by . Target engines have not stopped completely . . . additional propulsion noises  --  clanking . Air blowing , he 's blowing tanks . Coming up , target is coming up . We have bubbles on the surface . Hot damn , there he is ! " The Charlie 's how broke the surface six miles from the frigate . Three  | helicopters circled the wounded vessel like wolves , and Pharris turned north to close the target , her five-inch gun tracking it . It was n't necessary . The forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sail , jumping overboard as the submarine 's engine room filled with water . A total of ten got off before the submarine slid backward below the waves . Another appeared on the surface a few seconds later , but no more . The helicopters dropped life jackets to the men in the water . The helo with the rescue hoist aboard managed to lift two men before the frigate arrived on the scene . Morris supervised the operation from the bridge . The motor whaleboat was swiftly launched , and the rescue was an easy one . The Russian crewmen were stunned and did not resist . The helicopters guided the boat to each man , carefully searching the area for more . All eleven were recovered and the whaleboat returned to the drop lines . Pharris 's chief boatswain supervised the operation , an ensign standing quietly at his side . No one had seriously considered this possibility . A torpedo hit on a submarine was supposed to kill her entirely . Prisoners , Morris thought to himself . What the hell am I supposed to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , how to treat them . How to interrogate them  --  did he have anyone aboard who spoke Russian ? The captain turned the conn over to his executive officer and hurried aft . Armed crewmen were already there , holding their M-14 rifles awkwardly as they looked down with great curiosity at the whaleboat . The boat crew secured the hoist lines to the lift points , and the seaman on the winch lifted the boat up into the davits . The Soviets were not an impressive lot , many of them clearly in shock from their near escape from death . Morris counted three officers , one of them probably the captain . He whispered a quick command to Bosun Clarke . The chief had his armed party step back , and took the whistle from his pocket . As the whaleboat settled into place , he blew a three-tone note on his whistle and saluted the Soviet captain like an arriving dignitary . The Russian 's reaction was one of astonishment . Morris stepped forward to help him off the boat . " Welcome aboard , Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ed looked around briefly to see the incredulous expressions on his crew 's faces . But his ploy failed . The Russian said something in Russian , and either spoke no English or had the presence of mind to pretend he did n't . Someone else would have to handle the interrogation . Morris told his bosun to carry on . The Russians were taken below for a medical check . For the moment , they 'd be kept under guard in sickbay . The bosun hurried back for a moment . " Skipper , what the hell was that all about ? " Chief Boatswain 's Mate Clarke inquired . " They 've probably been told that we 'd shoot them in the head . I read a hook once that said the most effective technique  --   --  look , there was this Ger-  | man , the guy specialized in getting information out of our guys in World War Two , okay ? He was good at it , and what he did was treat our guys decently . Hell , they sponsored him to come over after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Separate the officers from the enlisted , and the senior EMs from the juniors . Keep ' em separate . Then make sure they 're kept comfortable . Feed ' em , give ' em cigarettes , make ' em feel safe . If you happen to know anyone aboard who has a bottle , get it , and give our guests a couple of stiff drinks . Everybody gets new clothes . We keep theirs . Send all of it to the wardroom . We 'll see if they have anything valuable . Make sure they 're treated nice , and just maybe we can get one or two to spill his guts . " " You got it , skipper . " The chief went away shaking his head . At least he 'd get to paint a whole submarine on the pilothouse this time . Morris went back to the pilothouse . He ordered his men to secure from general quarters , and the frigate to return to her patrol station . Next he called up the escort commander and reported on the prisoners . " Pharris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to paint a gold A ' on your ASROC launcher . Well done to all aboard , Ed . You 're the champs for this crossing . I 'll get back to you on the prisoners . Out . " The captain turned around to see that the bridge watch had not left . They 'd all heard the Commodore on the radio . Their fatigue was gone , and the grins directed at Morris meant more to him than the words of his boss . KIEV , THE UKRAINE Alekseyev looked over the intelligence material on his desk . His boss was in Moscow for a high-level briefing , but this data was  --  should be , he corrected himself  --  little different from what his commander was hearing . " Things are not going well in Germany ? " Captain Sergetov asked . " No . We were supposed to have reached the outskirts of Hamburg by H + 36 . A day and a half , the plan called for . Instead we 're not quite there yet , and Third Shock Army has taken murderous losses from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map . " If I were the NATO commander , I 'd counterattack again , right there . " " Perhaps they are unable to do so . Their first counterattack was repulsed . " " At the cost of a broken tank division and sixty aircraft . Victories like that we can do without . The picture in the south is scarcely better . The NATO forces are trading space for time , and doing it very well . Their ground forces and tactical aircraft are operating over the same ground they 've practiced on for thirty years . Our losses are nearly double the estimates , and we ca n't sustain that . " Alekseyev leaned back . He chided himself for being defeatist . It was mainly a manifestation of his desire to join the action . He was certain , as any general would be certain , that he could do things better .  | " What about NATO losses ? " " Heavy , we think . They have been remarkably profligate in their weapons expenditures . The Germans have staked too much on defending Hamburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I could not counterattack in their place , I would withdraw . A city is not worth breaking the balance of your army . We learned that lesson at Kiev ? " " Excuse me , Comrade General , what about Stalingrad ? " " A somewhat different situation , Captain . Remarkable , nonetheless , how history can repeat itself , " Alekseyev muttered , studying the map on the wall . He shook his head . West Germany had too much in the way of road communications for that to work . " The KGB reports that NATO has two , at most three weeks ' supply of munitions left . That will be the decisive factor . " " What of our supplies and fuel ? " the young captain asked . His answer was a scowl . ICELAND At least there was water . The streams were fed by glaciers that lay in the center of the island  --  water that had fallen as snow over a thousand years before , long before atmospheric pollution , and been compressed to ice . When finally it melted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water of crystalline purity and marvelous taste , but absolutely no nutritional value . It was also ice cold , and fords were not easily found . " Down to one day 's rations , Lieutenant , " Smith observed as they finished off their meal . " Yeah , we 'll have to think that one over . " Edwards assembled his trash . Garcia collected it all for burial . If there had been a way to cover their footprints in the dirt , Smith would have had them doing that too . It was n't easy . As Edwards assembled his radio , he listened to muttered Spanish curses and the sound of a folding shovel slamming against the loose rocks that passed for soil atop Hill 482 . " Doghouse , this is Beagle , and we 're running out of food , over . " " Sorry to hear that , Beagle . Maybe we 'll have some pizzas sent out . " " You funny bastard , " Edwards said without toggling the Transmit key . " What do you want us to do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " We 're alive , ai n't we ? Negative . " " Tell me what you can see . " " Okay , there 's a gravel road downhill to the north , maybe two miles away . Looks like a farm  --  plowed fields , like , but ca n't tell what 's growing there . Another sheep farm to the west of us , we passed it coming here . Lots of sheep . Ten minutes ago we saw a truck on the road heading west . Have n't seen anything flying yet today , but I suppose that 'll change . The only civil-  | ians we 've seen have been right by their houses , we have n't even seen farmers with their sheep , and the farm to the north has no visible activity . No  --  say again zero  --  civilian road traffic . Ivan 's got this island shut down , Doghouse , really shut down . That 's about all I can say . Tell those Vark drivers they really did the job on that powerhouse . Nothing left but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an electric light lit since . " " Copy that , Beagle . Okay , your orders are to head north towards Hvammsfjordur . You need to take a wide detour east to avoid all these bays I see . We want you there in ten days . Say again ten days , twelve at the most . You can make it easy . Stay out in the boonies and avoid contact with anyone . Continue the normal contact schedule and report on anything you see that may be of interest . Acknowledge . " " Roger , Doghouse , you want us in sight of Hvammsfjordur at the end of next week , and keep up the usual radio routine . Anything else ? " " Be careful . Out . " " Hvammsfjordur ? " Smith asked . " That 's a hundred miles on a straight line . " " They want us to detour east to avoid contact . " " Two hundred miles  --  walking over this shit . " Smith 's frown was enough to split a rock . " End of next week ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had n't known it would be that far . " Gon na be a little tough , Mr. Edwards . " The sergeant pulled a largescale map from his case . " I do n't even have cards for the whole coastline . Damn . Look here , Lieutenant . The ridges and rivers on this rock come out from the center like the spokes on a wheel , y'see ? That means we climb a lot , and these here ai n't little hills . All the low places got roads , and sure as hell we ca n't follow no roads , right ? " He shook his head . Edwards forced a grin . " Ca n't hack it ? I thought you Marines were in good shape . " Smith was a man who ran five miles every morning . He could not recall ever seeing this little Air Force wimp out doing roadwork . " Okay , Mr. Edwards . They say nobody ever drowned in sweat . On your feet , Marines , we got orders for a little hike . " Rodgers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly a term of endearment for an officer , but Smith figured that insubordination only counted if the officer knew he was being insulted . KEFLAVIK , ICELAND The helicopters took time to assemble . The big AN-22 transport had delivered two Mi-24 attack choppers , quite a load even for that four-engine monster . Another IL-76 flight had delivered the technicians and flight crews to assemble , service , and fly them . There had been a major oversight in the  | plan , the General thought . The one helicopter that had survived the strafing attack on the first day was now broken down  --  and of course the broken part was not one which had been included in their pre-packaged equipment . There should have been more helicopters . He shrugged eloquently . No plan was ever perfect . More helicopters would be flown in , plus a few more mobile radar sets and some additional SAM launchers . The Americans looked to have every intention of making his tenure on Iceland difficult , and he needed more equipment to counter that .. . Then there were those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they said . As if Iceland was n't already passive enough . There had been not a single incident of active resistance yet  --  not one , the General thought , remembering his year 's service in Afghanistan . Compared with that mountainous hell , this was paradise itself . But that was n't good enough for the KGB ! Nekulturny barbarians . A thousand hostages had been taken , only to learn that there was no jail space to keep them . So my paratroopers must guard the poor , harmless wretches , using up a whole company of troops . His orders were to cooperate with the local KGB contingent . One did not cooperate with the KGB , of course , one was dominated by them . There were KGB officers with his mobile patrols , to advise , they put it . General Andreyev was beginning to worry . Crack paratroopers were not the sort to be good jailers . Had they been ordered to go easily on the Icelanders , that would be one thing . Instead , their orders forced them to be harsh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cheer when the last American bombers had come through . Absurd , the General thought . They had lost electricity but we had lost nothing  --  and they cheered . Because of the KGB 's orders . What stupidity . An opportunity lost . He considered protesting his orders to his central command in Moscow , but to what point ? An officer who disliked the KGB was an officer who disliked the Party itself . He was aroused from his reveries by the whining sound of turboshaft engines . The first of the Mi-24 Hinds was turning its rotor , testing its engines . An officer ran toward him . " Comrade General , with your permission , we are ready for a test flight . We 're doing it light , unarmed . We 'll load weapons when we get back . " " Very well . Captain , just check out the hilltops around Keflavik and Rejkyavik . How long on the second one ? " Andreyev asked . " Two hours . " " Excellent . Good work , Comrade Captain . " A minute later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Down and freeze ! " Garcia screamed . It did n't come close to them , but seeing it was enough .  | " What kind is it ? " " Hind . It 's an attack bird , like the Cobra . Bad news , Lieutenant . It carries eight troops and a whole shitload of rockets and guns . An ' do n't even think about shooting at it . Sucker 's armored like a damned tank . " The Mi-24 circled the hill they 'd just been on , then disappeared , heading south to loop over another hill . " Did n't see us , I guess , " Edwards said . " Let 's keep it that way . Keep the radio stowed awhile , Lieutenant . We can call this one in after we move out a ways , okay ? " Edwards nodded agreement . He remembered a brief on Soviet helicopters in the Air Force Academy . " We are not afraid of the Russians , " an Afghan had been quoted , " but we are afraid of their helicopters . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six that evening . He shaved and walked outside , the sun still high in the evening sky . He wondered what mission they 'd have tonight . He was not a bitter man , but to have nearly a quarter of his crews ? men with whom he had worked for two straight years  --  lost in a week was a difficult thing to accept . It had been too long since his experience in Vietnam . He 'd forgotten how terrible losses could be . His men could not stand down a day to mourn their dead and ease the pain , much as they needed to . They were being carefully rested . Standing orders gave them eight hours of sleep a day  --  like night-hunters , they slept only by day . They were making a difference , however . He was sure of that . Every night the black and green Frisbees lifted off for some special target or other , and the Russians still had not figured a counter . The strike cameras mounted in each aircraft were bringing back pictures that the wing intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well . The colonel reminded himself that one sortie a day was a lighter load than the other air crews were bearing , and that the close-support crews were taking losses equal to his own . Tonight held another mission . He ordered his brain to occupy itself with that task alone . The briefings took an hour . Ten aircraft would fly tonight : two planes each at five targets . As commander he drew the toughest . Surveillance indicated that Ivan had a previously unsuspected forward fuel dump at a position west of Wittenburg that was supporting the drive on Hamburg , and the Germans wanted it taken out . His wingman would go in with Durandals , and he 'd follow with Rockeyes . There would be no supporting aircraft on this one , and the colonel did n't want jammer aircraft to go in with him . Two of his lost birds had had such support , and the jamming had merely alerted the defenses . Ile examined the topographical maps closely . The land was flat . Not  | much in the way of mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skim at treetop level , and that was almost as good . He 'd approach from the east , behind the target . There was a twenty-knot west wind , and if he came in from leeward , the defenders would be unable to hear his approach until bomb release . . . probably . They 'd egress the area by heading southwest . Total mission time seventy-five minutes . He computed his necessary fuel load , careful as always to allow for the drag of his bombs . To the bare-bones fuel requirements he added five minutes on afterburner in case of air-to-air combat and ten minutes to orbit Bitburg for landing . Satisfied , he went off for breakfast . With each bite of toast his mind ran through the mission like a movie , visualizing every event , every obstacle , every SAM site to be avoided . He randomly inserted the unexpected . A flight of low-level fighters at he target , what effect would this have on the mission ? What would the target look like on this approach ? If he had to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate with his commander in silence , recognizing the blank look on his face and running through his own mental checklist . They headed straight into East Germany for fifty miles before turning north at Rathenow . Two Soviet Mainstay aircraft were up , a good distance back from the border and surrounded by agile Flanker interceptors . Staying well outside the effective range of their radar , the two aircraft flew low and in tight formation . When they screeched over main roads , it was always in a direction away from a course to their target . They avoided cities , towns , and known enemy depots where there might be SAMs . The inertial navigation systems kept track of their progress on a map display on the pilot 's instrument panel . The distance to the target shrank rapidly as the aircraft curved west . They flashed over Wittenberg at five hundred knots . The infrared cameras showed fueling vehicles on the roads heading right for the target area ... there ! At least twenty tank trucks were visible in the trees , fueling from underground tanks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Roge , " acknowledged Shade-Two . " I have them visual . " The Duke broke left , clearing the way for his wingman to make the first run . Shade-Two 's aircraft was the the only one left with the proper ejector racks for the bulky hard-target munitions . " Gawd ! " The Duke 's display showed an SA-11 launcher right in his flight path , its missiles aimed northwest . One of his aircraft had learned the hard way that the SA- I I had an infrared homing capacity that no one had suspected . The colonel reefed his aircraft into a hard right turn away from the launcher , wondering where the rest of the missile battery 's vehicles were .  | Shade-Two skimmed over the target . The pilot toggled off his four bombs and kept heading west . Gunfire rippled across the sky in his wake . Too late . The French-made Durandal weapons fell off the ejector racks and scattered . Once free , they pointed down , and rockets fired to accelerate the munitions straight at the ground . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underground fuel tanks . The bombs did not explode on impact . Instead , the hard-steel weapons lanced into the ground , penetrating several feet before detonating . Three found underground fuel tanks . The Durandals exploded upward , breaking open a path for burning fuel to leap into the air . It was the next thing to a nuclear detonation . Three white columns of flame rocketed into the air , spreading like fountains and dropping fuel for hundreds of yards . Every vehicle in the compound was engulfed in flame , and only those men near the perimeter escaped with their lives . Rubber fuel bladders brought to the site exploded a few second later , and a river of burning diesel and gasoline spread through the trees . In a matter of seconds , twenty acres of woods were transformed into a fireball that raced skyward , punctuated by secondary explosions . Ellington 's fighter rocked violently as the shock wave passed . " Damn , " he said quietly . The plan called for him to use his cluster munitions to ignite what the Durandals had burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Duke , " Eisly observed . Ellington tried to blink away the dots as he turned away , keeping as low as he could . He found himself flying right down a road . The Soviet Commander-in-Chief of the Western Theater was already angry , and what he saw to the east did n't help . He 'd just conferred with the commander of the Third Shock Army at Zarrentin to learn that the attack had again bogged down within sight of Hamburg . Furious that his most powerful tank force had failed to achieve its objective , he 'd relieved its commander on the spot and was returning to his own command post . Now he saw what could only be one of his three major fuel depots rising into the clear sky . The General cursed and stood , pushing aside the roof panel on his armored command vehicle . As he blinked his dazzled eyes , a black mass seemed to appear at the lower edge of the fireball . What 's that ? Ellington wondered . His TV display showed four armored vehicles in a tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flicked his bomb-release controls to Armed and dropped his four Rockeye canisters , then turned south . Ills tail-mounted strike cameras recorded what followed .  | The Rockeyes split open , distributing their bomblets at a shallow angle across the road . They exploded on impact . CINC-West died a soldier 's death . His last act was to seize a machine gun and fire at the aircraft . Four bomblets fell within a few meters of his vehicle . Their fragments sliced through the light armor , killing everyone inside even before its fuel tank exploded , adding another fireball to a sky that had still not returned to darkness . USS CHICAGO The submarine came slowly to the surface , spiraling up to allow her sonar to check the entire area as she rose to antenna depth . His luck had been bad so far , McCafferty considered , which was not a situation that encouraged risk taking . As the submarine leveled off beneath the waves , the ESM mast went up first , sniffing for hostile electronic signals , then the search periscope . The captain made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his executive officer closely watching the television readout to back up the skipper 's observations . Everything looked clear . There was a moderate sea running , with five-foot swells , and the clear blue sky was decorated with fair-weather cumulus clouds . On the whole , a beautiful day . Except for the war . " Okay , transmit , " McCafferty ordered . His eyes never left the periscope , which he turned continuously , angling the lens up and down to look for trouble . A petty officer raised the UHF antenna , and the " okay to transmit " light blinked on in the radio room aft of the attack center . They had been summoned to the surface by an extremely low-frequency radio message with their call sign , QZB . The senior radioman powered up his transmitter , keyed out QZB on the UHF satellite broadcast band , and waited for a reply . There was none . He gave his neighbor a look and repeated the procedure . Again the satellite missed the signal . The petty officer took a deep breath and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hot printer in the after corner of the room began to print up a coded reply . The communications officer keyed a command into the cipher machine , and the clear text came up on another printer . TOP SECRET FR : COMSUBLANT TO : USS CHICAGO 1 .

McCafferty read the dispatch without comment , then handed it to the navigator . " How long to get there at fifteen knots ? " " About eleven hours . " The navigator took a pair of dividers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're flying , we 'll be there long before they are . " Joe ? " the captain looked at his executive officer . " I like it . Right on the hundred-fathom curve , and water conditions are a little squirrelly there , what with the Gulf Stream coming in so close and fresh water coming out of the fjords . They wo n't want to be too close inshore because of the Norwegian diesel boats , and they wo n't stray too far out because of the NATO nucs . If I had to bet , I 'd say they 'll come right to us . " " Okay , take her down to nine hundred feet and head east . Secure from general quarters . Let 's get everybody fed and rested . " Ten minutes later , Chicago was on a heading of zero-eight-one , steaming at fifteen knots . Deep , but in relatively warm water from the ocean current that begins in the Gulf of Mexico and runs all the way to the Barents Sea , she enjoyed sonar conditions that made detection by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noises . Her engines could drive the submarine at this speed with only a fraction of her total rated power , obviating the need for the reactor pumps . The reactor 's cooling water circulated on natural convection currents , which eliminated the major source of radiated noise . Chicago was completely in her element , a noiseless shadow moving through black water . The crew 's mood changed slightly , McCafferty noticed . Now they had a mission . A dangerous mission , but one they had trained for . Orders were carried out with calm precision . In the wardroom his tactical officers reviewed tracking and attack procedures long since memorized , and a pair of exercises were run on a computer . Charts were examined to predict likely places for especially bad water conditions in which they might hide . In the torpedo room two decks below the attack center , sailors ran electronic tests on green-painted Mk-48 " fish " and the Harpoon missiles in their white canisters . One weapon showed an electronic fault , and a pair of torpedomen immediately stripped off an inspection plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tomahawk missiles in their vertical launch tubes  | nested in the bow . Finally the weapons-control team ran a computer simulation through the Mk-117 attack director to ensure that it was fully operational . Within two hours they were sure that every system aboard was operating within expected limits . The crewmen exchanged hopeful smiles . After all , they reasoned , it was n't their fault that no Russian had been dumb enough to come their way , was it ? Just a few days before , had n't they practically landed on the beach  --  in Russia ! ? without being detected ? The Old Man was a real pro , was n't he ? USS PHARRIS Dinner was awkward to say the least . The three Russian officers sat at the end of the table , mindful of the two armed guards ten feet away , and the cook in the wardroom pantry who kept a large knife conspicuously in view . The officers were served by a young seaman , a beardless boy of seventeen who scowled mightily at the Russians as he served the salad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do any of you speak English ? " " I do , " answered one . " I am instructed my captain to thank you for rescue our men . " " Tell your captain that war has rules , and so does the sea . Please tell him also that he showed great skill in his approach . " Morris poured some Thousand Island dressing on his lettuce as the message was translated . His officers were keeping a close eye on their guests . Morris was careful to avert his gaze . His remark had the desired effect . A rapid exchange took place at the other end of the table . " My captain ask how you find us . We  --  how you say  --  get away from your helicopters , no ? " " Yes , you did , " Morris answered . " We did not understand your operating pattern . " " Then how you find us ? " " 1 knew you were attacked earlier by the Orion , and that you ran at high speed to catch up with us . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head . " What attack is this ? Who attack us ? " He turned to his commander and spoke for thirty seconds . There 's another Charlie out there , Morris thought , if he 's not lying to us . We ought to get someone who speaks Russian to talk to the crewmen below . Damn , why do n't I have one of those ? " My captain says you are mistake in this . Our first contact with you was from helicopters . We did not expect your ship to be here . Is this new tactic ? " " No , we 've practiced this for some years . " " I low you find us , then ? " " You know what a towed-array sonar is ? We first detected you on that , about three hours before we shot at you . "  | The Russian 's eyes went wide . " Your sonar so good as that ? " " Sometimes . " After this was translated the Russian captain spoke what seemed a terse order , and the conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the microphone into the Russians ' quarters yet . Perhaps what they said among themselves would be useful to fleet intelligence . Until then he 'd continue to make them comfortable . " How is the food aboard a Soviet submarine ? " " Not same as this , " the navigator answered after conferring with his boss . " Good , but not same . We eat different foods . More fish , less meat . We have tea , not coffee . " Ed Morris saw that his prisoners were going after their plates with scarcely concealed gusto . Even our sub guys do n't get enough fresh vegetables , he reminded himself . An enlisted man entered the wardroom and stood by the door . It was his leading radioman . Morris waved him over . The sailor handed the captain a message form . THE SPECIAL JOB IS DONE , it read , and Morris noted that the man had taken the time to print it up on a standard message format so that no one would suspect what it meant . The Russians ' accommodations were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nod and pocketed the form . His bosun had miraculously discovered two bottles of hard liquor  --  probably from the chiefs ' quarters , but Morris knew better than to inquire  --  and these would find their way to the Russians tonight . He hoped the liquor would loosen tongues .  | USS PHARRIS Morris did n't wave at the low-flying aircraft , but wanted to . The French Navy 's patrol plane signaled that they were within range of land-based air cover . It would take a very brave Russian sub skipper to want to play games here , with a screen of French diesel subs a few miles north of the convoy lane and several ASW patrol aircraft forming a tricolored umbrella over the convoy . The French had also sent out a helicopter to collect the Russian submariners . They were being flown to Brest for a full interrogation by NATO intelligence types . Morris did n't envy them the trip . They 'd be held by the French , and he had no doubt that the French Navy was in an evil mood after the loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of their conversations were also being sent . The Russians had talked among themselves , aided by the chiefs ' liquor , and perhaps their whispered conversations had some value . They were about to turn the convoy over to a mixed British-French escort force and take over a group of forty merchantmen bound for America . Morris stood on the bridge wing , turning every five minutes or so to look at the two half and one full silhouettes that the bosun had painted on both sides of the pilothouse ? " No sense having some jerk on the wrong side of the ship missing them , " the bosun had pointed out seriously . Their ASW tactics had worked fairly well . With Pharris as outlying sonar picket , and heavy support from the Orions , they had intercepted all but one of the inbound Russian  | subs . There had been a lot of skepticism on this point , but the tactic had worked , by God . But it had to work better still . Morris knew that things would be getting harder . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a fraction of their submarines into action against them . Those submarines were now forcing their way down the Denmark Strait . The NATO sub force trying to block the passage no longer had the SOSUS line to give them intercept vectors , nor Orions to pounce on the contacts that submarines could not reach . They would score kills , but would they score enough ? How much larger would the threat be this week ? Morris could see from their return route to the States that they were adding nearly five hundred miles to the passage by looping far to the south ? partially because of the Backfires , but more now to dilute the submarine threat . Two threats to worry about . His ship was equipped to deal with only one . They 'd lost a third of the convoy , mainly to aircraft . Could they sustain that ? He wondered how the merchant crews were holding up . They had closed in on the convoy , and he could see the northernmost line of merchies . On the horizon a big container ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses to read the signal . THANKS FOR NOTHING NAVY . One question answered . USS CHICAGO " So , there they are , " McCafferty said . The trace showed almost white on the screen , a thick spoke of broadband noise bearing three-two-nine . It could only be the Soviet task force heading for Bodo . " How far out ? " McCafferty asked . " At least two CZs , skipper , maybe three . The signal just increased in intensity four minutes ago . " " Can you get a blade count on anything ? " " No , sir . " The sonarman shook his head . " Just a lot of undifferentiated noise for the moment . We 've tried to isolate a few discrete frequencies , but even that 's all screwed up . Maybe later , but all we got now is a thundering herd . " McCafferty nodded . The third convergence zone was a good hundred miles off . At such ranges acoustical signals lost definition , to the point that their bearing to target was only a rough estimate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of where they thought , and at this range that was a difference measured in miles . He went aft to Control . " Take her west five miles at twenty knots , " McCafferty ordered . It was a gamble , but a small one . On reaching station , they 'd found unusually good water conditions , and the small move risked losing the contact temporarily .  | On the other hand , getting precise range information would give him a much better tactical picture and enable them to make a solid contact report  --  and make it by line-of-sight UHF radio before the Soviet formation got close enough that they could intercept the submarine 's transmission . As the boat raced west , McCafferty watched the bathythermograph trace . As long as the temperature did n't change , he 'd keep that good sound channel . It did n't . The submarine slowed rapidly and McCafferty went back to sonar . " Okay , where are they now ? " " Got ' em ! Right there , bearing three-three-two . " " XO , plot it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later the report was sent via satellite . The reply ordered Chicago in : GO FOR THE HEAVIES . ICELAND The farm was three miles away , thankfully downhill through tall , rough grass . On first sighting it through binoculars , Edwards called it the Gingerbread House . A typical Icelandic farmhouse , it had white stucco walls buttressed by heavy wooden beams , a contrasting red-painted trim , and a steeply pitched roof right out of the Brothers Grimm . The outlying barns were large , but low-slung with sod-covered roofs . The lower meadows by the stream were dotted with hundreds of large , odd-looking sheep with massively thick coats of wool , asleep in the grass half a mile beyond the house . " Dead-end road , " Edwards said , folding up the map . " And we could use some food . Gentlemen , it 's worth the chance , but we approach carefully . We 'll follow this dip to the right and keep that ridgeline between us and the farm till we 're within half a mile or so . " " Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men struggled into a sitting position to don their gear yet again . They 'd been moving almost continuously for two and a half days , and were now about thirty-five miles northeast of Reykjavik . A modest pace on flat roads , it was a man-killing effort cross country , particularly while staying watchful for the helicopters that were now patrolling the countryside . They had consumed their last rations six hours before . The cool temperatures and hard physical effort conspired to drain the energy from their bodies as they picked their way around and over the twothousand-foot hills that dotted the Icelandic coast like so many fence pickets . Several things kept them moving . One was the fear that the Soviet division they had watched airlifted in would expand its perimeter and snap them up . No one relished the thought of captivity under the Russians . But worse than this was fear of failure . They had a mission , and no taskmaster is harsher than one 's own self-expectations . Then there was pride . Edwards had to set an example for his men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , could hardly let a " wing-wiper " outperform them . Thus , without thinking consciously about it , four men contrived to walk themselves into the ground , all in the name of pride . " Gon na rain , " Smith said . " Yeah , the cover will be nice , " Edwards said , still sitting back . " We 'll wait for it . Jesus , I never thought working in daylight would be so Goddamned tough . There 's just something weird about not having the friggin ' sun go down . " " Tell me about it . And I ai n't even got a cigarette , " Smith growled . " Rain again ? " Private Garcia asked . " Get used to it , " Edwards said . " It rains seventeen days in June , on average , and so far this 's been a wet year . How d' you think the grass got so tall ? " " You like this place ? " Garcia asked , dumbfounded enough to forget the " sir . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My dad 's a lobsterman working out of Eastpoint , Maine . When I was a kid I went out on the boat every time I could , and it was always like this . " " What we gon na do when we get down to that house , sir ? " Smith brought them back to things that mattered . " Ask for food ? " " Ask ? " Garcia was surprised . " Ask . And pay for it , with cash . And smile . And say , Thank you , sir , ' " Edwards said . " Remember your manners , guys , unless you want him to phone Ivan ten minutes after we leave . " He looked around at his men . The thought sobered them all . The rain started with a few sprinkles . Two minutes later it was falling heavily , cutting visibility down to a few hundred yards . Edwards wearily got to his feet , forcing his Marines to do likewise , and they all moved downhill as the sun above the clouds dipped in the northwestern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  since they 'd probably have to climb it the next day , they thought of it as a mountain  --  had a name , but none of them could pronounce it . By the time they were a quarter mile from the farmhouse , it was as dark as it would get , and the rain had the visibility down to about eighty yards . " Car coming . " Smith saw the glare of the lights first . All four men dropped and instinctively aimed their rifles at the dots on the horizon . " Relax , guys . This road here breaks off the main road , and those lights could just be  --  shit ! " Edwards cursed . The lights had n't taken the sweeping turn on the coastal highway . They were coming down the road to the farm . Was it a car or a track with its driving lights on ? " Spread out and stay awake . " Smith stayed with Edwards , and the two privates moved downhill about fifty yards . Edwards lay prone , his elbows propped up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't think they could be spotted . The Marine pattern camouflage made them nearly invisible in daylight as long as they did n't move rapidly . In the dark they were transparent shadows . " Looks like a pickup , four-by-four , something like that . Lights are pretty far off the ground , bouncing around too much to be a track , " Edwards thought aloud . The lights came directly  --  but slowly  --  to the farmhouse and stopped . Its doors opened , men got out , and one stepped in front of the headlights before they were extinguished . " Damn ! " Smith snarled . " Yep , looks like four or five Ivans . Get Garcia and Rodgers over here , Sergeant . " " Right . " Edwards kept his binoculars on the house . There were no electric lights lit . He guessed that this area got its power from Artun , and he 'd watched the bombs wipe that plant off the map . There was some internal illumination , though , maybe from candles or a hurricane lamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told himself ; our electricity went off often enough , from nor'eastern storms or ice on the wires . The people in that house had to be asleep . Working farmers , early to bed , early to rise  --  wears you out and dulls the brain , Edwards thought . Through the lenses he watched the Russians  --  he counted five  --  circle the house . Like burglars , he thought . They looking for . . . us ? No . If they were looking for us , there 'd be more than five guys in a four-by-four . That 's interesting . They must be looting  --  but what if somebody . Jesus , we know that somebody lives there . Somebody lit that lamp . What are they up to ? " What gives , sir ? " Smith asked . " Looks like we got five Russkies . They 're playing peeper , looking in the windows and  --  one just kicked the door in ! I do n't like the way this is going , troops , I ? " A scream confirmed his evaluation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the falling rain and made them feel someone 's terror , chilling men already cold . " People , let 's move in a little . We stay together and we damned well stay alert . " " Why we movin ' in now , sir ? " Smith asked sharply . " ' Cuz I say so . " Edwards stowed his field glasses . " Follow me . " Another light was lit in the building , and it seemed to be moving around . Edwards walked quickly , keeping low in a way that punished his back . In two minutes he was a few yards from the truck that had driven in , no more than twenty yards from the home 's front door . " Sir , you 're getting a little careless , " Smith warned . " Yeah , well , if I guess right , so are they . 1 bet ? "  | There was a sound of breaking glass . A shot rang out through the semidarkness . It was followed by a blood-chilling shriek  --  and a second shot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What the hell 's going on in there ? " Garcia asked in a rasp . A hoarse male voice shouted something in Russian . The front door opened and four men came out . They conferred for a moment , then split into pairs , going left and right to side windows , where all four men stood to look inside . Then there came another scream , and it was perfectly clear what was going on . " Those son of a bitches , " Smith observed . " Yeah , " Lieutenant Edwards agreed . " Let 's back off and think about this for a minute . " The four men retreated about fifty yards and bunched together . " I think it 's time we do something . Anybody disagree ? " Edwards asked . Smith just nodded , interested in Edwards 's change of demeanor . " Okay , we take our time and do it right . Smith , you come with me and we go around the left . Garcia and Rodgers go around the right . Go wide and come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em alive , that 's okay . If not , stick ' em . We try not to make noise . But if you got ta shoot , make Goddamned sure the first burst does it . Okay ? " Edwards looked around for additional Russians . None . The four men slipped out of their packs , checked their watches , and moved out , crawling through the wet grass . There was another scream , but none after that . Edwards was glad there were n't  --  he did n't need the distraction . The crawling was a slow , tiring effort that sapped the strength from his arms . Edwards and Smith took a long route , around a tractor and some other implements . When they came into the clear there was only one man on their side of the house . Where 's the other one ? the lieutenant asked himself . Now what do we do ? You got ta stick to the plan . Everyone 's depending on you . " Back me up . " Smith was amazed . " Let me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Edwards whispered . He set his M-16 down and drew his combat knife . The Russian soldier made it easy , as he stood on tiptoe , entranced with the goings-on within the farmhouse . Ten feet behind him , Edwards got to his feet and approached one slow step at a time . It took him a moment to realize that his target was a full head taller than he was  --  how was he supposed to take this monster alive ? He did n't have to . There must have been an intermission inside . The Soviet private slumped down and reached in his pocket for a pack of cigarettes , then turned slightly to light one from a cupped match . He caught Edwards out of the corner of his eye , and the American lieutenant lunged forward with his knife , stabbing the larger man in the throat . The Russian started to cry out , but Edwards wrestled him down and slapped his left hand  | over the man 's mouth as he struck again with the knife . Edwards twisted the man 's head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blade grated against something hard , and his victim went slack . Edwards felt nothing , his emotions submerged in a flood of adrenaline . He wiped the knife on his trousers and stood on the man 's body to look in the window . What he saw caught the breath in his throat . " Hi , guys ! " Garcia whispered . Two Russian privates turned to face a pair of M-16s . They had left their rifles in the truck . Garcia gestured at the ground with his rifle , and both men went facedown , spread-eagled . Rodgers frisked them both for weapons , then went around the front to report in . " Took ' em both alive , sir . " He was surprised to see their " wing-wiper " lieutenant with blood on his hands . " I 'm going in , " Edwards told Smith . The sergeant nodded quickly . " I 'll cover you from here . Rodgers , you back him up . " The lieutenant moved through the half-open door . The living room was empty and unlit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a steady pale light . Edwards approached the corner  --  and found himself faced with a Russian in the process of unbuttoning his pants . There was no time for much of anything . Edwards rammed his knife under the man 's ribs , turning his right hand within the brass-knuckled grip as he pushed the blade all the way in . The man screamed and lifted himself up on his toes before falling backward , trying to get himself off the knife . Edwards withdrew and stabbed again , falling atop the man in a grotesquely sexual position . The paratrooper 's hands tried to force him off , but the lieutenant felt the strength drain from his victim as he moved farther forward to stab him again in the chest . A shadow moved and he looked up to see a man stumbling forward with a pistol  --  and the room exploded with noise . " Freeze , motherfucker ! " Rodgers screamed , his M-16 aimed at the man 's chest , and everyone 's ears ringing from the thunder of the three-round burst . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time they had called him that . " Yeah . " Edwards got to his feet , letting Rodgers precede him as he backed the Russian up . The man was exposed below the waist , his pants hobbling his ankles . The lieutenant picked up the pistol the Soviet had dropped and looked down at the man he 'd knifed . There was no doubt that he was dead . His handsome Slavic face was contorted with surprise and pain , and his uniform blouse was soaked black with blood . The eyes might have been marbles for all the life they contained . " You okay , ma'am ? " Rodgers asked , briefly turning his head around . Edwards saw her for the second time , sprawled out on the wooden floor . A pretty girl , her woolen nightdress torn apart , barely covering one breast , and the rest of her pale body , already red and bruised in several places , e.poxd for all to see . Beyond her in the kitchen Edwards saw the unmoving  | legs of another woman . He went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also dead . Each body displayed a single red circle in the chest . Smith came in . He looked around the room , then at Edwards . The wimp had fangs . " I 'll check the upstairs . Heads up , skipper . " Rodgers kicked the Russian down to the floor and placed his bayonet point in the small of his back . " You move and I 'll fuckin ' cut you in half , " the private snarled . Edwards stooped down to the blond girl . Her face was puffing up from blows to the jaw and cheek , her breath coming in shudders . He guessed her age at twenty or so . Her nightdress was destroyed . Edwards looked around and , pulling the cloth off the dining room table , draped it over her . " You okay ? Come on , you 're alive , honey . You 're safe . You 're okay now . " Her eyes seemed pointed in different directions at first , then they focused and came over to the young lieutenant . Edwards cringed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek as gently as he could . " Come on , let 's get you up off the floor . Nobody 's going to hurt you , not now . " She started shaking so violently that it seemed the whole house would join her . He helped her up , careful to wrap the tablecloth all around her . " Come on . " " Upstairs is clear , sir . " Smith returned , holding a robe . " You wan na put this on the lady ? They do anything else to her ? " " Killed her mom and dad . And a dog . I imagine they were going to do her , too , when they got finished . Sarge , get things organized . Search the Russians , get some food , anything else that looks useful . Move quick , Jim . Lots of things we got ta do . You have a first-aid pack ? " " Right , skipper . Here . " Smith tossed him a small package of bandages and antiseptics , then went back out the door to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cleaned off . " Edwards wrapped his left arm around her shoulders and helped her up the steep old wooden steps . His heart went out to the girl . She had china-blue eyes , obscenely empty of life though even now they caught the light in a way certain to attract any man 's attention . As they just had , Edwards thought . She was only an inch shorter than he , with pale , almost transparent skin . Her figure was marred by a slight bulge at the abdomen , and Mike had a good idea what that was , the rest of her figure was so perfect . And she 'd just been raped by one Russian , paving the way for a long night of it , Mike Edwards thought , enraged that once more this foul crime had touched his life . There was a small room at the top of the twisting stairs . She entered it and sat on the single bed . " Wh-wh-who  --  " she stammered in accented English . " We 're Americans . We escaped from Keflavik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Vigdis Agustdottir . " The slightest sign of life in her voice . Vigdis , the  | daughter of Agust , dead in the kitchen . He wondered what Vigdis meant , sure that it was n't pretty enough . He set the hurricane lamp on the night table and broke open the pack . Her skin was broken along the jawline , and he swabbed disinfectant there . It had to hurt , but the girl did n't wince at all . The rest of her , he 'd seen , was just bruised , maybe some scrapes on her back from the hardwood floor . She 'd fought hard to defend herself , and taken a dozen punches . And certainly she was no virgin . Just a bloodied face . It could have been far worse , but Edwards 's rage continued to grow . Such a pretty face desecrated  --  well , he 'd already reached that decision . " You ca n't stay here . We have to leave soon . You 'll have to leave , too . " " But ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the Russians attacked , I lost some friends , too . Not the same as your mom and dad , but  --  Jesus ! " Edwards 's hands shook in frustration as he stumbled through the meaningless words . " I 'm sorry we did n't get here sooner . " What is it that some of the feminists say ? That rape is the crime that all men use to subjugate all women ? Then why do you want to go downstairs and ? Edwards knew that something almost as satisfying was in the works . He took her hand and she did n't resist . " We 're going to have to leave . We 'll take you anywhere we can . You must have family around here , or friends . We 'll take you to them and they can take care of you . But you ca n't stay here . If you stay here , you 're sure to get killed . Do you understand ? " He saw her head nod jerkily in the shadows . " Yes . Please  --  please leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Okay . " He touched her cheek again . " If you need anything , call us . " Edwards went back downstairs . Smith had taken charge . There were three men on their knees , blindfolded , gagged , and hands tied behind their backs . Garcia was standing over them . Rodgers was in the kitchen . Smith was sorting through a pile of stuff on the table . " Okay , what d'we got here ? " Smith regarded his officer with something akin to affection . " Well , sir , we got us a Russian lieutenant with a wet dick . A dead sergeant . A dead private , and two live ones . The lieutenant had this , sir . " Edwards took the map and unfolded it . " Damn , ai n't that nice ! " The map was covered with scribbled markings . " We got another set of binoculars , a radio  --  shame we ca n't use that ! Some rations . Looks like shit , but better'n nothin ' . We done good , skipper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do we need to take , Jim ? " " Just food , sir . I mean , we could take a couple of their rifles , and that 'd double up our ammo load , y'know ? But we 're already loaded pretty heavy ?  | " And we are n't here to fight a war , just to play scout . Right . " " I think we ought a take some clothes , sweaters and like that . We taking the lady with us ? " " Have to . " Smith nodded . " Yeah , makes sense . Hope she likes walkin ' , sir . Looks like she 's in decent shape , ' cept for being pregnant . Four months , I 'd say . " " Pregnant ? " Garcia turned . " Rapin ' a pregnant girl ? " He muttered something in Spanish . " Any of them say anything ? " Mike asked . " Not a word , sir . " Garcia answered . " Jim , take a look at the girl , and get her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " " Do n't worry , sir . " Smith went upstairs . " The lieutenant 's the one with it hanging out , right ? " Garcia nodded and Edwards went around to face him . He had to remove the gag and blindfold . The man was his own age . He was sweating . " You speak English ? " The man shook his head . " Spreche deutsch . " Edwards had taken two years of German in high school , but suddenly found himself unwilling to talk with this man . He had already decided to kill him , and he did n't wish to speak with someone he was about to kill  --  it might bother his conscience . Edwards did n't want his conscience to remember this . But he watched the man for a minute or two , examining what sort of person would do what he had done . He expected to discover something monstrous , but did n't . He looked up . Smith was leading Vigdis down the stairs . " She 's got good gear , skipper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . I expect we can get her a canteen , a parka , and a field pack . I 'd let her bring a brush an ' girl stuff , sir . 1 ' 11 get us some soap , too , and maybe a razor . " " Way to go , Sergeant . Vigdis , " Edwards said , getting her attention . " We will be leaving soon . " He turned to look back down at the Russian : " Leutnant . Wofur ? Warum ? " What for  --  why did you do all this ? Not for me . For her . The man knew what was coming . He shrugged . " Afghanistan . " " Skipper , they 're prisoners , " Rodgers blurted . " I mean , sir , you ca n't ? " " Gentlemen , you are charged under Uniform Code of Military Justice with one specification of rape and two specifications of murder . These are capital crimes , " Edwards said , mainly so that he could assuage his conscience for the other two . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ? You are found guilty . Your sentence is death . " With his left hand , Edwards pushed the lieutenant 's head back . His right hand flipped the knife into the air , reversing it ; then he swung it viciously , striking the man 's larynx with  | the pommel . The sound was surprisingly loud in the room , and Edwards kicked him backward . A terrible thing to watch , it lasted several minutes . The lieutenant 's larynx was instantly fractured , and its swelling blocked his trachea . Unable to breathe , his torso bucked from side to side as his face darkened . Everyone in the room who could see watched . If any felt pity for the man , none showed it . Finally he stopped moving . " I 'm sorry we were n't faster , Vigdis , but this thing wo n't be hurting anyone else . " Edwards hoped that his amateur psychiatry would work . The girl went back upstairs , probably to wash , he thought . He 'd read that after being raped one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a visible stigma from being the victim of an animal 's lust . He turned toward the remaining two . There was no way they could manage prisoners , and what they had been up to merely provided him with a good excuse . But these two had n't hurt the girl yet , and " I 'll take care of it , sir , " Garcia said quietly . The private was standing behind the kneeling prisoners . One of them was making some noise , but even if he had n't been gagged , none of the Americans knew a word of Russian . They had no chance at all . Garcia stabbed from the side , sticking his knife completely through one neck , then the other . Both men fell . It was over quickly . The private and the lieutenant went into the kitchen to wash their hands . " Okay , we load them back into the four-by-four and drive it back to the main road . We 'll see if we can fake an accident and torch the vehicle . Get some liquor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking . " " They were , sir . " Rodgers held up a bottle of clear liquor . Edwards gave the bottle a brief look , but shook off the thought . " Figures . If I guess right , these guys were the crossroads guards from the main highway  --  or maybe just a patrol . I do n't think they can guard every crossroads on this island . If we 're just a little lucky , maybe their bosses 'll never figure out we were involved in this . " A long shot , he thought , but what the hell ? " Skipper , " Smith said . " If you want to do that , we got ta ? " " I know . You and Rodgers stay here and get ready . If you see anything else we can use , pack it up . When we get back , we 'll have to haul ass . " Edwards and Garcia loaded all the bodies into the back of the truck , careful to sort through the battle gear . They unloaded waterproof parkas whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few other items that would n't be missed , then drove off quickly down the road . Luck was with them . There was no permanent guard post at the crossroads , perhaps because the farm road led nowhere . The Russians had probably been a patrol team , and had chosen the farm for a little informal R &R.; Two hundred yards clown the coastal highway the road paralleled a steep  | cliff . They halted the vehicle there and manhandled the bodies into the seats . Garcia emptied a jerrican of gasoline into the back and the two men pushed it toward the edge with the rear hatch open . Garcia tossed a Russian grenade into the back as it went over the edge . Neither man wanted to admire their handiwork . They ran back the half mile to the farmhouse . Everything was ready . " We have to bum the house , Miss Vigdis , " Smith was explaining . " If we do n't , the Russians 'll know for sure what happened here . Your mom and dad are dead , ma'am , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , okay ? " She was still too much in shock to offer more than token resistance . Rodgers and Smith had cleaned off the bodies , and moved them upstairs to their own bedroom . It would have been better to bury them , but there just was n't time . " Let 's get moving , people , " Edwards ordered . They should have been moving already . Somebody had to be coming to investigate the burning truck , and if they used a chopper ... " Garcia , you watch the lady . Smith has the rear . Rodgers , take the point . We have to put six miles between us and this place in the next three hours . " Smith waited ten minutes before tossing his grenade into the house . The kerosene he 'd spread on the first floor went up at once . USS CHICAGO The contact was a lot better now . They had classified one ship as a Kashinclass missile destroyer , and her propeller-blade count indicated a speed of twenty-one knots . The leading elements of the Soviet formation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two groups , the leading formation fanned out and screening the second . McCafferty ordered the ESM mast raised . It showed lots of activity , but he expected that . " Up scope . " The quartermaster worked the operating ring , then snapped the handles into place and stepped back . McCafferty swept the horizon quickly . After ten seconds , he flipped the handles up , and the periscope was instantly lowered back into its well . " It 's going to be a busy day , troops , " the captain said ; he always let the attack center crew know as much of what was going on as possible . The more they knew , the better they could do their jobs . " I saw a pair of Bear-Fs , one due north , the other west . Both a good way off , but you can bet they 're dropping sonobuoys . XO , take her back down to five hundred feet , speed five knots . We 'll let them come to us . " " Conn , sonar . " " Conn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some pingers , active sonobuoys to the northwest . We count six  | of them , all very faint . " The sonar chief read off the bearings to the signal sources . " Still no active sonar signals coming from the target formation , sir . " " Very well . " McCafferty returned the mike to its holder . Chicago 's depth was changing quickly , as they dove at a fifteen-degree angle . He watched the bathythermograph readout . At two hundred twenty feet the water temperature began to drop rapidly , changing twelve degrees inside of seventy feet . Good , a strong layer to hide under , and cold water deep to allow good sonar performance for his own sensors . Two hours before he had removed a torpedo from one of his tubes and replaced it with a Harpoon missile . It gave him only one torpedo ready for instant use if he found a submarine target , but a salvo of three missiles available to fling at surface ships , plus his Tomahawks . He could fire either now , and expect hits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no sense wasting a missile on a small patrol craft when there was a cruiser and a carrier out there waiting for him . He wanted to identify specific targets first . It would n't be easy , but he knew that easy things did n't have to be done by the 688-class subs . He went forward into sonar . The chief caught him out the corner of his eye . " Skipper , I may have a bearing to Kirov . I just copied six pings from a low-frequency sonar . I think that 's him , bearing zero-three-nine . Trying to isolate his engine signature now . And if  --  okay , some more sonobuoys are dropping to the right . " The display showed new points of light well to the right of the first string , and a sizable gap between the two . " Think he 's dropping them in chevrons , Chief ? " McCafferty asked . He got a smile and a nod for an answer . If the Soviets were deploying their sonobuoys in angled lines left and right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were heading right for Chicago . The submarine would not have to maneuver at all to intercept them . She could stay as quiet as an open grave . " They seem to be alternating them above and below the layer , sir . A pretty fair gap between them , too . " The chief lit a cigarette without averting his eyes from the screen . The ashtray next to him was crammed with butts . " We 'll plot that one out . Good work , Barney . " The captain patted his sonar chief on the shoulder and went back to the attack center . The firecontrol tracking party was already plotting the new contacts . It looked like an interval of just over two miles between the sonobuoys . If the Soviets were alternating them above and below the layer , there was a good chance he could sneak between a pair . The other question was the presence of passive buoys , whose presence he could not detect . McCafferty stood at the periscope pedestal , watching his men at work as they entered data into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with paper plots and hand-held calculators . The weapons-control panel was lit up by indicators showing ready . The submarine was at battle stations . " Take her up to two hundred feet , we 'll listen above the layer for a few minutes . " The maneuver paid off at once . " I got direct-path to the targets , " the sonar chief announced . They could now detect and track sound energy radiating directly from the Soviet ships , without depending on the on-again , off-again convergence zones . McCafferty commanded himself to relax . He 'd soon have work enough . " Captain , we 're about due for another sonobuoy drop . They 've been averaging about every fifteen minutes , and this one might be close . " " Getting that Horse-Jaw sonar again , sir , " sonar warned . " Bearing threetwo-zero at this time . Signal weak . Classify this contact as the cruiser Kirov . Stand by another one . We have a medium-frequency active sonar bearing three-three-one , maneuvering left-to-right . We classify this contact as a Kresta-II ASW cruiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plotting officer said . " Bearing three-two-zero is close to our bearings for a pair of screen ships , but far enough off that it 's probably a different contact . Three-three-one is consistent with the center screen ship . It figures . The Kresta will be the screen commander , with the flagship a ways behind him . Need some time to work out the ranges , though . " The captain ordered his submarine to stay above the layer , able to duck beneath it in seconds . The tactical display was evolving now . He had a workable bearing on Kirov . Almost good enough to shoot on , though he still needed range data . There seemed to be a pair of escorts between him and the cruiser , and unless he had a proper range estimate , any missile he launched at the Soviet flagship might attack a destroyer or frigate by mistake . In the interim , the solution on the attack director set the Harpoons to fly straight for what he believed to be the battle cruiser Kirov . Chicago began to zigzag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submarine changed her position , the bearing to her sonar contacts changed also . The tracking party could use the submarine 's own course deviation as a baseline to compute ranges to the various contacts . A straightforward process  --  essentially an exercise in high-school trigonometry  --  it nevertheless took time because they had to estimate the speed and course of the moving targets . Even computer support could n't make the process go much faster , and one of his quartermasters took great pride in his ability to use a circular slide rule and race the computer to a hard solution . The tension seemed to grow by degrees , then it plateaued . The years of training were paying off . Data was handled , plotted , and acted upon in seconds . The crew suddenly seemed a physical part of the gear they were operating , their feelings shut off , their emotions submerged , only the sweat  | on their foreheads betraying that they were men after all , and not machines . They depended absolutely on their sonar operators . Sound energy was their only indication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triggered furious activity . It was clear that their targets were zigzagging , which made the range computations even more difficult . " Conn , sonar ! Active sonobuoy close aboard to port ! Below the layer , I think . " " Right full rudder , all ahead two-thirds , " the executive officer ordered instantly . McCafferty went to sonar and plugged in a set of headphones . The pings were loud but . . . distorted , he thought . If the buoy was below the temperature gradient , the signals radiating upward would be unable to detect his submarine  --  probably . " Signal strength ? " he asked . " Strong , " the chief replied . " Even money they might have picked us up . Five hundred yards farther out and they lose us for sure . " " Okay , they ca n't monitor them all at once . " The XO moved Chicago a thousand yards before returning to base course . Overhead , they knew , was a Bear-F ASW aircraft armed with homing torpedoes and a crew whose job it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the buoys and the men ? That was one thing that they did n't know . Three tense minutes passed and nothing happened . " All ahead one-third , come left to three-two-one , " the executive officer ordered . They were now through the line of buoys . Three more such lines were between them and their target . They 'd nearly determined range for three of the escorts , but not to the Kirov yet . " Okay , people , the Bears are behind us . That 's one less thing to worry about . Range to the nearest ship ? " he asked the approach officer . " Twenty-six thousand yards . We think he 's a Sovremenny . The Kresta is about five thousand yards east of him . He 's pinging away with hull and VDS sonars . " McCafferty nodded . The variable-depth sonar would be below the layer and had scant chance of detecting them . The hull sonar they 'd have to pay attention to , but it would n't be a problem for a while yet . Okay , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan " Conn , sonar , torpedoes in the water , bearing three-two-zero ! Signal faint . Say again torpedoes in the water , three-two-zero , bearing changing ? additional , lots of active sonars just lit up . We 're getting increased screw noises for all contacts . " McCafferty was in the sonar room before the report ended . " Torpedo bearing change ? " " Yes ! Moving left-to-right  --  Jesus , I think somebody 's attacking the Russians . Impact ! " The chief jabbed his finger at the display . A series of three bright spokes appeared right on the hearing to Kirov . The display suddenly went berserk . The high- and medium-frequency segment lit up with p 300 active sonar lines . The lines indicating ships became brighter as the ships increased engine speeds and changed direction as they began to maneuver . " Secondary explosion on this contact  --  holy shit ! Lots of explosions in the water now . Depth charges , maybe , something 's really ripping the water up . There 's another torpedo  --  way off , bearing changing right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for McCafferty to follow . The chief expanded the time scale to allow easier interpretation , but only he and his experienced operators could understand it . " Skipper , it looks like somebody just got inside on them and launched an attack . He got three solid hits on Kirov , and now they 're trying to beat on him . These two ships appear to be converging on something . I  --  another torpedo in the water , do n't know whose . Gawd , look at all these explosions ! " McCafferty went aft . " Periscope depth , now ! " Chicago angled upward , taking a minute to reach her position . He saw what might have been a mast on the horizon , and a column of black smoke , bearing three-two-zero . Over twenty radars were operating along with a number of voice radios . " Down scope . We have any target solutions ? " " No , sir , " the XO answered . " When they started maneuvering , all our data went to hell . " " How far to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're positioned to run right through a gap . " " Make your depth eight hundred feet . Ahead full , move us in . " Chicago 's engines sprang into life , accelerating the submarine to thirty knots . The executive officer dived the boat to eight hundred feet , ducking deep below a sonobuoy set for shallow search . McCafferty stood over the chart table , took a pen from his pocket , and unconsciously began chewing on the plastic end as he watched his sub 's course take him closer and closer to the enemy formation . Sonar performance dropped virtually to nil with the high speed , but soon the low-frequency sounds of the exploding ordnance echoed through the steel hull . Chicago ran for twenty minutes , zigzagging slightly to avoid the Russian sonobuoys , as the fire-control men kept updating their solutions . " Okay , all ahead one-third and take her back up to periscope depth , " McCafferty said . " Tracking party , stand by for a firing run . " The sonar picture cleared up rapidly . The Soviets were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flagship . One ship 's trace was entirely gone  --  at least one Russian ship had been sunk or crippled . Explosions rippled through the water , punctuated by the screeing sound of homing torpedoes . All were close enough to be a matter of real concern . " Shooting observation . Up scope ! " The search periscope slid upward . McCafferty caught it low and swept  | the horizon . " I  --  Jesus ! " The TV monitor showed a Bear only half a mile to their right , heading north for the formation . He could see seven ships , mainly mast tops , but one Sovremenny-class destroyer was hull-down , perhaps four miles away . The smoke he 'd seen before was gone . The water resounded with the noise of Russian sonars . " Raise the radar , power-up , and stand by . " A petty officer pushed the button to raise the submarine 's surface-search radar , activated the system , but kept it in standby mode . " Energize and give me two sweeps , " the captain ordered . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detect the submarine 's radar and try to attack it . The radar was on for a total of twelve seconds . It " painted " a total of twenty-six targets on the screen , two of them close together about where he would have expected Kirov to be . The radar operator read off ranges and bearing , which were entered into the Mk-117 fire-control director and relayed to the Harpoon missiles in the torpedo tubes , giving them bearing to target and the range at which to switch on their seeker-heads . The weapons officer checked his status lights , then selected the two most promising targets for the missiles . " Set ! " " Flood tubes . " McCafferty watched the weapons-panel operator go through the launch sequence . " Opening outer doors . " " Solution checked and valid , " the weapons officer said calmly . " Firing sequence : two , one , three . " " Shoot ! " McCafferty ordered . " Fire two . " The submarine shuddered as the powerful impulse of highpressure air ejected the weapon from the tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fire one ... fire three . Two , one , and three fired , sir . Torpedo tube doors are shut , pumping out to reload . " " Reload with Mark-48s . Prepare to fire Tomahawks ! " McCafferty said . The fire-control men switched the attack director over to activate the bowmounted missiles . " Up scope ! " The quartermaster spun the control wheel . McCafferty let it come all the way up . He could see the smoke trail of the last Harpoon , and right behind it . . . McCafferty slapped the periscope handles up and stepped back . " Helix heading in ! Take her down , all ahead flank ! " The submarine raced downward . A Soviet antisub helicopter had seen the missile launch and was racing in at them . " Left full rudder . " " Left full rudder , aye ! " " Passing through one hundred feet . Speed fifteen knots , " the XO reported . " There he is , " McCafferty said . The pings from the helicopter 's active sonar reverberated through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a noise-  | maker . " The captain ordered his submarine back to an easterly course and reduced speed as they dropped through the layer . With luck the Soviets would mistake the noisemaker for the cavitation noises of the submarine and attack it as Chicago drew clear . " Conn , sonar , we have a destroyer heading in , bearing three-three-nine . Sounds like a Sovremenny  --  torpedo in the water aft . We have one torpedo in the water bearing two-six-five . " " Right twenty degrees rudder . All ahead two-thirds . Come to new course one-seven-five . " " Conn , sonar , new contact , twin screws , just started with a low-frequency sonar , probably a Udaloy , blade count says twenty-five knots , bearing three-five-one and constant . Torpedo bearing changing , heading aft and fading . " " Very well . " McCafferty nodded . " The helicopter dropped on the noisemaker . We do n't have to sweat that one . All ahead one-third , make your depth one thousand feet . " The Sovremenny he did n't worry too greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new Soviet destroyer carried a low-frequency sonar that could penetrate the layer under certain conditions , plus two helicopters and a long-range rocket-boosted torpedo weapon that was better than the American ASROC . Ba-wah ! The sound of a low-frequency sonar . It had hit them on the first shot . Would it report Chicago 's position to the Udaloy ? Or would the submarine 's rubber coating prevent it ? " Target bearing three-five-one . Blade count is down , indicates speed of ten knots , " sonar reported . " Okay , he 's slowed to search for us . Sonar , how strong was that ping ? " " Low edge of detection range , sir . Probably did not get a return off us . Contact is maneuvering , bearing now three-five-three . Continuing to ping , but his sonar is searchlighting west-to-east away from us . Another helo is pinging , sir , bearing zero-nine-eight . This one 's below the layer , but fairly weak . " " XO , take us west . We 'll try to loop around them to seaward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sonar room . He was tempted to engage the Udaloy , but could not launch a torpedo this deep without using a dangerously high amount of his reserve high-pressure air . Besides , his job was to kill the command ships , not the escorts . His firecontrol team set up a solution anyway in case killing the Russian destroyer became a necessity . " God , what a mess , " the chief breathed . " The depth-charging up north has tapered off some . Bearing is steadying down on these contacts here . Either they 've resumed their base course or they 're heading away . Ca n't tell which . Uh-oh , more sonohuoys are dropping down . " The chief 's finger  | traced the new dots , in a steady line  --  heading toward Chicago . " Next one 's going to be real close , sir . " McCafferty stuck his head into the attack center . " Bring her around south , and go to two-thirds . " The next sonobuoy splashed into the water directly overhead . Its cable deployed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They got us for sure , skipper ! " McCafferty ordered a course change to the west and again increased to full speed to clear the area . Three minutes later a torpedo dropped into the water , either dropped by the Bear or fired from the Udaloy , they could n't tell . The torpedo started searching for them from a mile off and turned away . Again their rubber anechoic coating had saved them . A helo 's dipping sonar was detected ahead of them . McCafferty went south to avoid it , knowing that he was being driven away from the Soviet fleet , but unable to do much about it at the moment . A pair of helicopters was now after him , and for a submarine to defeat two dipping sonars was no simple exercise . It was clear that their mission was not so much to find him as to drive him off , and he could not maneuver fast enough to get past them . After two hours of trying , he broke off for the last time . The Soviet force had moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward Andoya . McCafferty swore to himself . He 'd done everything right , gotten through the outer Soviet defenses , and had had a clear idea of how to duck under the destroyer screen . But someone had gotten there first , probably attacked Kirov  --  his target ! ? and messed everything up for his approach . His three Harpoons had probably found targets unless Ivan had shot them down  --  but he 'd been unable even to monitor their impacts . If they had made impacts . The captain of USS Chicago wrote up his contact report for transmission to COMSUBLANT and wondered why things were going the way they were . STORNOWAY , SCOTLAND " A long way to go , " the fighter pilot said . " Yeah , " Toland agreed . " Our last report had the group heading southeast to evade a submarine attack . We figure they 're back to a southerly course now , but we do n't know where they are . The Norwegians sent their last RF-5 in to look , and it disappeared . We have to hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we need to know where they are . " " No satellite intel ? " " Nope . " " Okay . I go in with the reconnaissance pod , out and back . . . four hours . I 'll need a tanker to top me off about three hundred miles out . " " No problem , " the RAF group captain agreed . " Do be careful , we need all your ' 1'omeats to escort the strike tomorrow . "  | " I 'll be ready in an hour . " The pilot left . " Wish you luck , old boy , " the group captain said quietly . This was the third attempt to locate the Soviet invasion force by air . After the Norwegian reconnaissance aircraft had disappeared , the Brits had tried with a Jaguar . That , too , had vanished . The most obvious solution was to send a Hawkeye with the strike to conduct a radar search , but the Brits were n't letting the E-2s stray too far from their shore . The U.K. radar stations had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local defense . " It 's not supposed to be this hard , " Toland observed . Here was a golden opportunity to pound the Soviet fleet . Once located , they could strike the force at dawn tomorrow . The NATO aircraft would swoop in with their own air-to-surface missiles . But the extreme range of the mission gave no time for the strike force to loiter around looking . They had to have a target location before they took off . The Norwegians were supposed to have handled this , but NATO plans had not anticipated the virtual annihilation of the Royal Norwegian Air Force in a week 's time . The Soviets had enjoyed their only major tactical successes at sea , and they were successes indeed , Toland thought . While the land war in Germany was heading toward a high-technology stalemate , up to now the vaunted NATO navies had been outmaneuvered and outthought by their supposed dullard Soviet adversaries . Taking Iceland had been a masterpiece of an operation . NATO was still scrambling to reestablish the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom barrier with submarines that were supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far into the North Atlantic , hitting one convoy a day , and the main Russian submarine force had n't even gotten there yet . The combination of the two might just close the Atlantic , Toland thought . Then the NATO armies would surely lose , for all their brilliant performance to date . They had to stop the Soviets from taking Bodo in Norway . Once emplaced there , Russian aircraft could attack Scotland , draining resources from the German front and hampering efforts to interdict the bomber forces heading into the Atlantic . Toland shook his head . Once the Russian force was located , they 'd pound hell out of it . They had the right weapons , the right doctrine . They could launch their missiles outside the Russian SAM envelopes , just as Ivan was doing to the convoys . It was about time things changed . The tanker lifted off first , followed half an hour later by the fighter . Toland and his British counterpart sat in the intelligence center napping , oblivious to the teletype printer that chattered in the corner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would alert them , and senior officers needed their sleep , too . " Huh ? " Toland started when the man tapped his shoulder . " Coming in , sir  --  your Tomcat is arriving , Commander . " The RAF ser-  | geant handed Bob a cup of tea . " Fifteen minutes out . Thought you might wish to freshen up . " " Thanks , Sergeant . " Toland ran a hand over his unshaven face and decided not to shave . The group captain did , mainly to preserve the look that went with an RAF mustache . The F-14 came in gracefully , its engines idling and wings outstretched as though grateful for the chance for a landing on something larger than a carrier . The pilot taxied into a hard shelter and quickly dismounted . Technicians were already removing the film cartridge from the camera pod . " Nothing on their fleet , guys , " he said at once . The radar-intercept officer came down behind him . " God , there 's fighters up there ! " The RIO said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we went through aggressor school . " " And I got one of the bastards , too . But no joy on the fleet . We covered the coast from Orland to Skagen before we turned back , not one surface ship visible . " " You 're certain ? " the group captain asked . " You can check my film , Captain . No visual sightings , nothing on infrared , no radar emissions but airborne stuff  --  nothing , but lots of fighters . We started finding those just south of Stokke and counted  --  what was it , Bill ? " " Seven flights , mainly MiG-23s , I think . We never got a visual , but we picked up a lot of High Lark radars . One guy got a little close and I had to pop him with a Sparrow . We saw the flash . That was a hard kill . In any case , guys , our friends ai n't coming to Bodo unless it 's by submarine . " " You turned back at Skagen ? " " Ran out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighter opposition really started picking up north of Bodo . If you want a guess , we need to check out Andoya , but we need something else to do it , SR-71 maybe . I do n't think I can get in and out of there except on burner . I 'd have to tank right close to there even to try that , and  --  like I said , lots of fighters were operating there . " " Hardly matters , " the group captain said . " Our aircraft have n't the legs for a strike that far without massive tanker support , and most of our tankers are committed elsewhere . "  | ICELAND Once clear of the meadow , they were back in what the map called wasteland . It was level for the first kilometer , then the uphill effort began in earnest on the Glymsbrekkur , a seven-hundred-foot climb . So soon your legs forget , Edwards thought . The rain had n't let up , and the deep twilight they had to guide them forced a slow pace . Many of the rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was treacherous , and a misstep could easily be fatal . Their ankles were sore from the constant twists on the uneven ground , and their tightly laced boots did n't seem to help anymore . After six days in the back country , Edwards and his Marines were beginning to understand what fatigue was . At each step their knees gave just an inch or so too much , making the next step that much more of an effort . Their pack straps cut cruelly into their shoulders . Their arms were tired from carrying their weapons and from constantly adjusting their gear . Necks sagged . It was an effort to look up and around , always having to be alert for a possible ambush . Behind them the glow of the house fire disappeared behind a ridgeline , the first good thing that had happened . No helicopters yet , no vehicles investigating the fire . Good , but how long would that last ? How soon would the patrol be missed ? they all wondered . All but Vigdis . Edwards walked a few yards in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobs , wanting to say something to her , but not knowing what . Had he done the right thing ? Was it murder ? Was it expedi-  | ency ? Or was it justice ? Did that matter ? So many questions . He set them aside . They had to survive . That mattered . " Take a break , " he said . " Ten minutes . " Sergeant Smith checked to see where the others were , then sat down beside his officer . " We done good , Lieutenant . I figure four , maybe five miles in the past two hours . I think we can ease up a little . " Edwards smiled wanly . " Why not just stop and build a house here ? " Smith chuckled in the darkness . " I hear you , skipper . " The lieutenant studied the map briefly , looking up to see how well it matched with what he could see . " What say we go left around this marsh ? The map shows a waterfall here , the Skulafoss . Looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and find a cave or something . If not , it 's deep . No choppers 'll come in there , and we 'll have shadows to hide in . Five hours ? " " ' Bout that , " Smith agreed . " Roads to cross ? " " Nothing shows but foot trails . " " I like it . " Smith turned to the girl , who watched them without a word as she sat with her back against a rock . " How do you feel , ma'am ? " he inquired gently . " Tired . " Her voice said more than that , Edwards thought . There was no emotion there , none at all . He wondered if this was good or bad . What was the right thing to do for the victims of serious crime ? Her parents murdered before her eyes , her own body brutally violated , what kind of thoughts were going through that head ? Get her mind off it , he decided . " How well do you know this area ? " the lieutenant asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many times . " Her head leaned back into a shadow . Her voice cracked and dropped into quiet sobs . Edwards wanted to wrap an arm around her , to tell her things were all right now , but he was afraid it might only make things worse . Besides , who would believe that things were all right now ? " How we fixed for food , Sarge ? " " I figure we got maybe four days ' worth of canned stuff . I went through the house pretty good , sir , " Smith whispered . " Got a pair of fishing rods and some lures . If we take our time , we ought to be able to feed ourselves . Lots of good fishin ' creeks around here , maybe at this place we 're goin ' . Salmon and trout . Never could afford to do it myself , but I heard tell that the fishing 's really something . You said your daddy 's a fisherman , right ? " " Lobsterman  --  close enough . You said you could n't afford ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucks a day to fish up here , " Smith explained . " Hard to afford on a sergeant 's pay , you know ? But it they charge that much , there must be a shitload of fish in the water , right ' ? "  | " Sounds reasonable , " Edwards agreed . " Time to move . When we get to that mountain , we 'll belly-up for a while and get everybody rested . " " I 'll drink to that , skipper . Might make us late getting to ? " " Screw it ! Then we 're late . The rules just changed some . Ivan 's liable to be looking for us . We take it slow from now on . If our friends on the other end of this radio do n't like it , too damned bad . We 'll get there late , but we 'll get there . " " You got it , skipper . Garcia ! Take the point . Rodgers , cover the back door . Five more hours , Marines , then we sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morris loved it . The convoy of ballasted ships was steaming into the teeth of a forty-knot gale . The sea was an ugly , foamwhipped shade of green , droplets of seawater tearing off the whitecaps to fly horizontally through the air . His frigate climbed up the steep face of endless twenty-foot swells , then crashed down again in a succession that had lasted six hours . The ship 's motion was brutal . Each time the bow nosed down it was as though the brakes had been slammed on a car . Men held on to stanchions and stood with their feet wide apart to compensate for the continuous motion . Those in the open like Morris wore life preservers and hooded jackets . A number of his young crewmen would be suffering from this , ordinarily  --  even professional sailormen wanted to avoid this sort of weather  --  but now mainly they slept . Pharris was back to normal Condition-3 steaming , and that allowed the men to catch up on their rest . Weather like this made combat nearly impossible . Submarines were mainly a one-sensor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on sonar and the crashing sea noise tended to blanket the ship sounds submarines listened for . A really militant sub skipper could try running at periscope depth to operate his search radar , but that meant running the risk of broaching and momentarily losing control of his boat , not something a nuclear submarine officer looked kindly upon . A submarine would practically have to ram a ship to detect it , and the odds against that were slim . Nor did they have to worry about air attacks for the present . The sea 's crenelated surface would surely confuse the seeker head of a Russian missile . For their own part , their bow-mounted sonar was useless , as it heaved up and down in a twenty-foot arc , sometimes rising completely clear of the water . Their towed-array sonar trailed in the placid waters a few hundred feet below the surface , and so could theoretically function fairly well , but in practice , a submarine had to be moving at high speed to stand out from the violent surface noise , and even then engaging a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helicopter was grounded . Taking off might have been possible , but landing was a flat impossibility under these conditions . A  | submarine would have to be within ASROC torpedo range  --  five miles  --  to be in danger from the frigate , but even that was a slim possibility . They could always call in a P-3 Orion  --  two were operating with the convoy at present ? but Morris did not envy their crews a bit , as they buffeted through the clouds at under a thousand feet . For everyone a storm meant time off from battle , for both sides to rest up for the next round . The Russians would have it easier . Their longrange aircraft would be down for needed maintenance , and their submarines , cruising four hundred feet down , could keep their sonar watches in comfort . " Coffee , skipper ? " Chief Clarke came out of the pilothouse , a cup in his hand with a saucer on top to keep the saltwater out . " Thanks . " Morris took the cup and drained half of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Too tired to barf , sir . " Clarke laughed . " Sleeping like babies . How much longer this slop gon na last , Cap'n ? " " Twelve more hours , then it 's supposed to clear off . High-pressure system right behind this . " The long-range weather report had just come in from Norfolk . The storm track was moving farther north . Mostly clear weather for the next two weeks . Wonderful . The chief leaned outboard to see how the forward deck fittings were taking the abuse . Every third or fourth wave , Pharris dug her nose in hard , occasionally taking green water over the bow . This water slammed into things , and the chief 's job was to get them fixed . Like most of the 1052s assigned to the stormy Atlantic , Pharris had been given spray strakes and higher bow plating on her last overhaul , which reduced but did not entirely eliminate the problem known to sailors since men first went to sea : the ocean will try very hard to kill you if you lack the respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred details before he turned back . " Looks like she 's riding this one out okay . " " Hell , I 'd settle for this all the way back , " Morris said after finishing off his coffee . " After it 's over , we 'll have to round up a lot of merchies , though . " Clarke nodded agreement . Station-keeping was not especially easy in this kind of weather . " So far , so good , Captain . Nothing big has come loose yet . " " How ' bout the tail ? " " No sweat , sir . I got a man keeping an eye on that . Should hold up nice , ' less we have to speed up . " Both men knew they would n't speed up . They were making ten knots , and the frigate could n't run much faster than that in these seas no matter what the cause . " Heading aft , sir . " " Okay . Heads up . " Morris looked aloft to check that his lookouts were still alert . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All kinds .  | STORNOWAY , SCOTLAND " Andtya . They were n't heading for Bodo after all , " Toland said as he pored over the satellite photographs of Norway . " How many troops on the ground do you think ? " " At least a brigade , Group Captain . Maybe a short division . Lots of tracked vehicles here , lots of SAMs , too . They 're already basing fighters at the airfield . Be bombers next  --  maybe there by now . These shots are three hours old . " The Russian naval force was already headed back to the Kola Fjord . They could reinforce by air now . He wondered what had happened to the regiment of Norwegians supposed to be based there . " Their Blinder light bombers can reach us from there . Bastards can dash in and out at high-mach numbers , be bloody difficult to intercept . " The Soviets had launched a systematic attack on the RAF radar stations arrayed on the Scottish coast . Some attacks were by air-to-surface missiles , others by submarine-launched cruise missiles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but that one had been costly . RAF Tornados had killed half of the raiders , mainly on the return leg . Twin-engine Blinder bombers could deliver their heavy bombloads after running in low and fast . Probably why Ivan wanted Andoya , Toland thought . Perfectly located for them . Easy to support from their own northern bases , and just a little too far for fighter-bombers in Scotland to counterattack without heavy tanker support . " We can get there , " the American said , " but it means getting half our attack birds loaded up with buddy stores . " " No chance . They 'll never release them from the reserve force . " The group captain shook his head . " Then we have to start running a heavy patrol over the Faroes , and that keeps us from bothering Iceland too much . " Toland looked around the table . " Do n't you just love it when a plan comes together ? How do we take the initiative away from these bastards ? We 're playing their game . We 're reacting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . That 's how you lose , people . Ivan 's got his Backfires standing down because of this front moving across the central Atlantic . They 'll be flying again tomorrow after a good day 's rest , gunning for our convoys . If we ca n't hit Andoya , and we ca n't do much about Iceland , what the hell are we going to do , just sit here and worry about defending Scotland ? " " If we allow Ivan to establish air superiority over us ? " " If Ivan can kill the convoys , Group Captain , we lose the fucking war ! " Toland pointed out . " True . You 're quite correct , Bob . The problem is , how do we hit the Backfires ? They appear to be flying directly down over Iceland . Fine , we  | have a known area of transit , but it 's protected by MiGs , laddy . We 'd end up sending fighters to battle fighters . " " So we try something indirect . We gun for the tankers they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations officers had silently been watching the intelligence types talk . " How the hell are we going to find their tankers ? " one asked now . " You think they can refuel thirty or more bombers without some radio chatter ? " Toland asked . " I 've listened in on Russian tanker ops by satellite , and I know there 's chatter . Let 's say we can get a snooper up there , and he finds out where they 're tanking . Why not then put some Toms astride their flightpath home ? " " Hit them after they tank the strike ... " the fighter jock mused . " It wo n't do diddly for the strike today , say , but it 'll hurt the bastards tomorrow . If we succeed even once , then Ivan has to change his operational pattern , maybe send fighters out with them . If nothing else , we 'll have them reacting to us for a change . " " And perhaps take the heat off us , " the group captain went on . " Right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't begin to show how hard it would be . The Skula River had carved a series of gorges over the centuries . The river was high , and the falls generated a cloud of spray from which a rainbow arched in the morning sun . It made Edwards angry . He 'd always liked rainbows before , but this one meant the rocks they had to climb down were slick and wet . He figured it to be two hundred feet down to a floor of granite boulders . It looked a lot farther than that . " You ever do any rock climbin ' , Lieutenant ? " Smith asked . " Nope , nothing like this . You ? " " Yeah , ' cept we mostly practice goin ' up . This here ought a be easier . Do n't worry too much about slipping . These boots hold pretty good . Just make sure you set your feet on something solid , okay ? And you take it nice and slow . Let Garcia lead off . I already like this place , skipper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there , and I do n't think anybody 'll ever spot us down this hole . " " Okay , you watch the lady . " " Right . Garcia , lead off . Rodgers , cover the rear . " Smith slung his rifle across his back as he walked to Vigdis . " Ma'am , you think you can handle this ? " Smith held out his hand . " I have been here before . " She almost smiled until she remembered who had brought her here , and how many times . She did n't take his hand .  | " That 's good , Miss Vigdis . Maybe you can teach us a thing or two . You be careful , now . " It would have been fairly easy except for their heavy packs . Each man carried a fifty-pound load . The added weight and their fatigue affected their balance , with the result that someone watching from a distance might have taken the Marines for old women crossing an icy street . It was a fifty-degree slope down , in some places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps by the wild deer that throve here . For the first time fatigue worked in their favor . Fresher , they might have tried to move more quickly ; as it was , each man was near the end of his string , and feared his own weakness more than the rocks . It took over an hour , but they made it down with nothing worse than cuts on their hands and bruises somewhere else . Garcia crossed the river to the east side , where the canyon wall was steeper , and they camped out on a rocky shelf ten feet above the water . Edwards checked his watch . They had been on the move continuously for more than two days . Fifty-six hours . Each found himself a place in the deep shadows . First they ate . Edwards downed a can of something without troubling to see what it was . His burps tasted like fish . Smith let the two privates sleep first , and gave his own sleeping bag to Vigdis . The girl fell mercifully asleep almost as quickly as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area while Edwards watched , amazed that he had any energy left at all . " This is a good spot , skipper , " the sergeant pronounced finally , collapsing down next to his officer . " Smoke ? " " I do n't smoke . Thought you were out . " " I was . The lady 's dad did , though , and I got a few packs . " Smith lit an unfiltered cigarette with a Zippo lighter bearing the globe and anchor of the Marine Corps . He took a long pull . " Jesus , ai n't this wonderful ! " " I figure we can spend a day here to rest up . " " Sounds good to me . " Smith leaned back . " You held up pretty good , Lieutenant . " " I ran track at the Air Force Academy . Ten-thousand-meter stuff , some marathons , that sort of thing . " Smith gave him a baleful look . " You mean I 've been trying to walk a damned runner into the ground ? " " You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edwards massaged his shoulders . He wondered if the pain from his pack straps would ever go away . His legs felt as though someone had hammered on them with a baseball bat . He leaned back and commanded every muscle in his body to relax . The rocky ground did n't help , but he could not raise the energy even to look for a better spot . He remembered something . " Should n't somebody stand guard ? " " 1 thought about that , " Smith said . He was lying hack also , his helmet  | down over his eyes . " I think just this once we can forget it . Only way anybody 'll spot us is if a chopper hovers right overhead . Nearest road 's ten miles from here . Screw it . What d' you think , skipper ? " Edwards did n't hear the question . KIEV , THE UKRAINE " Ivan Mikhailovich , are your bags packed ? " Alekseyev asked . " Yes , Comrade General . " " Commander-in-Chief West is missing . He was en route from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is thought he might have been killed by an air attack . We 're taking over . " " Just like that ? " " Not at all , " Alekseyev said angrily . " They took thirty-six hours to decide that he was probably dead ! The maniac had just relieved Third Shock 's commander , then disappeared , and his deputy could n't decide what to do . A scheduled attack never began , and the fucking Germans counterattacked while our men were waiting for orders ! " Alekseyev shook his head to clear it and went on more calmly . " Well , now we will have soldiers running the campaign , not some politically reliable whoremonger . " Sergetov again noted his superior 's puritanical streak . It was one of the few traits that agreed exactly with Party policy . " Our mission ? " the captain asked . " While the General takes charge at the command post , you and I will tour the forward divisions to ascertain the situation at the front . Sorry , Ivan Mikhailovich , I 'm afraid this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I speak good English in addition to Arabic , " the younger man sniffed . Alekseyev had checked that out before writing up the transfer orders . Captain Sergetov had been a good company officer before being lured out of uniform by the promise of a comfortable life of Party work . " When do we leave ? " " We fly out in two hours . " " In daylight ? " The captain was surprised at that . " It would appear that air travel by day is safer . NATO claims to dominate the night sky . Our people say otherwise , but they are flying us out in daylight . Draw your own conclusions , Comrade Captain . " DOVER AIR FORCE BASE , DELAWARE A C-5A transport aircraft sat outside its hangar , waiting . Within the cavernous structure a team of forty  --  half officers in naval dress , half civilians wearing General Dynamics coveralls  --  worked on Tomahawk missiles . While one group removed the massive antiship warheads and replaced them with something else , the other group 's task was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the usual ship-hunting packages being removed in favor of terrain-matching systems that the men knew were used only for nuclear-tipped missiles intended for land targets . The guidance boxes were new , fresh from the factory . They had to be checked and calibrated . A delicate job . Though the systems had already been certified by the manufacturer , the usual peacetime routines were gone , replaced with an urgency that all of them felt but none of them knew the reason for . The mission was a complete secret . Delicate electronic instruments fed pre-programmed information into the guidance packages , and other monitors examined the commands generated by the on-board computers . There were only enough men to check out three missiles at a time , and each check took just over an hour . Occasionally one would look up to see the massive Galaxy transport , still waiting , its crew pacing about between trips to the weather office . When each missile was certified , a grease pencil mark was made next to the " F " code letter on the warhead , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nearly a third of the guidance packages were discarded and replaced . Several had failed completely , but the problems with most were quite minor , though serious enough to warrant replacement instead of adjustment . The technicians and engineers from General Dynamics wondered about that . What sort of target demanded this sort of precision ? All in all , the job took twenty-seven hours , six more than expected . About half of the men boarded the aircraft , which lifted off the concrete twenty minutes later , bound for Europe . They slept in the rear-facing seats , too tired to care about the dangers that might await them at their destination , wherever that was . THE SKULAFOSS , ICELAND Edwards was sitting up almost before he knew why . Smith and his Marines were even faster , already on their feet , weapons in their hands and racing to cover . Their eyes scanned the rocky rim of their small canyon as Vigdis continued to scream . Edwards left his rifle and went to her . The automatic reaction of the Marines was to assume that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edwards knew different . Her eyes looked blankly toward the bare rocks a few yards away , her hands gripped at the bedroll . By the time he reached her , she had stopped screaming . This time Edwards did not stop to think . He grabbed her around the shoulders and pulled her head toward his own . " You 're safe . Vigdis , you are safe . " " My family , " she said , her chest heaving as she caught her breath . " They kill my family . Then ? " " Yes , but you are alive . " " The soldiers , they  --  " The girl had evidently loosened her clothes to  | sleep more comfortably . Now she drew back from Edwards , pulling them tight around her . The lieutenant kept his hands away from her clothes and wrapped the sleeping bag around her . " They will not hurt you again . Remember all of what happened . They will not hurt you again . " She looked into his face . He did n't know what to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there were other things there , and Edwards did n't know this girl well enough to read what she was thinking . " The one who kill my family . You kill  --  killed him . " Edwards nodded . " They are all dead . They can not hurt you . " " Yes . " Vigdis looked down at the ground . " You all right ? " Smith asked . " Yeah , " Edwards answered . " The lady had a  --  a bad dream . " " They come back , " she said . " They come back again . " " Ma'am , they ai n't never coming back to hurt you . " Smith grasped her arm through the sleeping bag . " We 'll protect you . Nobody will hurt you while we are here . Okay ? " The girl nodded jerkily . " Okay , Miss Vigdis , now why do n't you try to get some sleep ? Ai n't nobody gon na hurt you while we 're around . You need us , you can call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise , but the girl 's hand came out of the bag and took his arm . " Please , do not go away . I  --  fear , fear to be alone . " " Okay . I 'll stay with you . You lie back and get some sleep . " Five minutes later her eyes were closed and her breathing was regular . Edwards tried not to look at her . Should she suddenly awake and see his eyes on her  --  what might she think ? And she could be right , Edwards admitted to himself . Two weeks ago , had he encountered her at the Keflavik Officers Club . . . he was a young , unattached man , and she was evidently a young , unattached woman . His main thought after the second drink would have been to get her back to his quarters . A little soft music . How beautiful she would have looked there , slipping demurely from her fashionable clothes in the soft light coming through the shades . Instead he had met her stark naked , cuts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Edwards knew without thinking that if another man tried to put hands on her , he 'd kill him without hesitation , and he could n't bring himself to think of what taking the girl himself might be like  --  his only likely thought if he had encountered her on the street . What if I had n't decided to come to her house ? he wondered . She 'd be dead by now , along with her parents . Probably someone would have found them in a few days ... like they 'd discovered Sandy . And that , Edwards knew all along , was the reason he 'd killed the Russian lieutenant and enjoyed the man 's slow trip to hell . A pity no one had seen fit to do that ?  | Smith waved to him . Edwards rose quietly and walked over . " I got Garcia on guard . I think we better go back to being Marines after all . If that 'd been for real , we 'd all be cold meat by now , Lieutenant . " " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , sir . The lady okay ? " " She 's had a tough time . When she wakes up  --  hell , I do n't know . I 'm afraid she might just come apart on us . " " Maybe . " Smith lit a cigarette . " She 's young . She might bounce back if we give her a chance . " " Get her something to do ? " " Same as us , skipper . You 're better off doin ' than thinkin ' . " Edwards checked his watch . He 'd actually gotten six hours of sleep before all this had happened . Though his legs were stiff , otherwise he felt better than he would have imagined . It was an illusion , he knew . He needed at least another four hours , and a good meal , before he 'd be ready to move . " We wo n't move out until about eleven . I want everybody to get some more sleep and one decent meal before we head out of here . " " Makes sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should have done that a long time ago , I just do n't want to climb those damned rocks . " " Lieutenant , I 'm just a dumbass grunt , but instead a doing that , why do n't you just walk downstream about half a mile ? You ought a be able to track in on your satellite that way , right ? " Edwards turned to look north . Walking about that far would lower the angle to the satellite as well as climbing . . . why did n't I think of that ? Because like any good Air Force Academy graduate , you thought in terms of up-and-down instead of sideways . The lieutenant shook his head angrily , noting the sergeant 's sly grin before he lifted the radio pack and heading down the canyon 's rocky floor . " You 're very late , Beagle , " Doghouse said at once . " Repeat your status . " " Doghouse , things are just terrible . We had a run-in with a Russian patrol . " Edwards explained for another two minutes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your orders are to avoid , repeat avoid , contact with the enemy . How do you know that somebody does n't know you 're there ? Over ! " " They 're all dead . We rolled their vehicle over a cliff and set fire to it . We made it look like an accident , just like on TV . It 's all over , Doghouse . No sense worrying about it now . We are now ten klicks from where it happened . I 'm resting my men for the rest of the day . We will continue our march north tonight . This may take longer than you expect . The terrain is rugged as hell , but we 'll do our best . Nothing more to report . We ca n't see much from where we are . "  | " Very well . Your orders are unchanged , and please do n't play white knight again  --  acknowledge . " " Roger that . Out . " Edwards smiled to himself as he repacked the radio . When he got back to the others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He lay down beside her , careful to stay a few feet away .

" " The Sovs do not exactly have an exemplary record for dealing with civilians , " the first man pointed out . " The Soviet airborne troops are known for their stern discipline , " the second replied . Formerly a major in the SAS , and invalided out , he was now a senior man with the Special Operations Executive , the SOE . " Conduct like this is not indicative of well-disciplined troops .

They 'd come in aboard a light bomber , racing in at low level to a military airport east of Berlin , no more than four staff members to an aircraft . All had arrived safely , but Alekseyev wondered how much of it was skill and how much luck . This airfield had clearly been visited by NATO aircraft recently and the General already had his doubts about what his colleagues in the Air Force had told him about their ability to control the sky even in daylight . From Berlin a helicopter took his party to CINC-West 's forward command post outside Stendal . Alekseyev was the first senior officer to arrive at the underground bunker complex , and he did not like what he found . The staff officers present were too concerned with what the NATO forces were doing and not concerned enough with what the Red Army was supposed to be doing to them . The initiative had not been lost , but his first impression was that the danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started assembling information on how the campaign was going . His commander arrived half an hour later , and immediately took Alekseyev into his office . " Well , Pasha ? " " I have to see the front at once . We have three attacks under way . I need to see how they are going . The German counterattack at Hamburg was repulsed , again , but this time we lack the forces to exploit it . The northern area is currently in stalemate . Our deepest penetration to date is just over one hundred kilometers . The timetable has gone completely to hell , losses are far higher than expected  --  on both sides , but worse for us . We have gravely  | underestimated the lethality of NATO antitank weapons . Our artillery has been unable to suppress them enough for our forces to achieve a major breakthrough . NATO air power is hurting us badly , especially at night . Reinforcements are not getting forward as well as we expected . We still have the initiative in most areas , but unless we achieve a breakthrough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We must find a weakness in NATO lines and launch a major coordinated attack soon . " " The NATO situation ? " Alekseyev shrugged . " Their forces are fully in the field . Further reinforcements are coming in from America , but from what our prisoners have told us , not so well as they expected . My impression is that they are stretched very thin in some areas , but we have not as yet identified a major area of weakness . If we can find one , and exploit it , I think we can rupture the front and stage a multidivisional breakout . They ca n't be strong everywhere . The German demand for forward defense compels the NATO forces to try and stop us everywhere . We made the same mistake in 1941 . It cost us heavily . It must be doing the same to them . " " How soon do you wish to visit the front ? " " Within the hour . I 'll take Captain Sergetov with me ? " " The Party man 's son ? If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer in the Soviet Army , whatever his father might be . I need him . " " Very well . Keep me posted on where you are . Send the operations people in . We have to get control of this whorehouse . " Alekseyev commandeered a new Mi-24 attack helicopter for his reconnaissance . Overhead , a flight of agile MiG-21 fighters guarded the General as the helicopter skimmed low over the treetops . He eschewed the seat , instead crouching by the windows to see what he could . A lifetime of military service had not prepared him for the destruction that lay on the landscape below him . It seemed that every road held a burned-out tank or truck . The major crossroads had gotten particularly severe attention from NATO air power . Here a bridge had been knocked out , and immediately behind it a company of tanks waiting its repair had been savaged . The charred remains of aircraft , vehicles , and men had transformed the neat , picturesque German countryside into a junkyard of high-technology weapons . As they crossed the border into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been fought for , each tiny village . He counted eleven smashed tanks outside one such village , and wondered how many others had been pulled off the battlefield for repair . The town itself was almost totally destroyed by artillery and resulting fires . He saw only one building that looked like it might be habitable . Five kilometers west , the same story was repeated , and Alekseyev realized that a whole regiment of tanks had been lost in a ten-kilometer advance down a single road . Ile began to see NA'IY ) equipment , a German  | attack helicopter identifiable only from the tail rotor that stuck out from the circle of ashes , a few tanks and infantry carriers . For both sides the proud vehicles manufactured at the greatest expense and skill were scattered on the landscape like trash thrown from a car window . The Soviets had more to expend , the General knew , but how many more ? The helicopter landed at the edge of a forest . Just within the treeline , Alekseyev saw , antiaircraft guns tracked them all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ducking under the still-turning main rotor as they ran into the trees . There they found a cluster of command vehicles . " Welcome , Comrade General , " said a dirty-faced Red Army colonel . " Where is the divisional commander ? " " I 'm in command . The General was killed day before yesterday by enemy artillery fire . We have to move the CP twice a day . They are becoming very skilled at locating us . " " Your situation ? " Alekseyev asked curtly . " The men are tired , but they can still fight . We are not getting sufficient air support , and the NATO fighters give us no rest at night . We have about half our nominal combat strength , except in artillery . That 's down to a third . The Americans have just changed tactics on us . Now , instead of attacking the leading tank formations , they are sending their aircraft after our guns first . We were badly hurt last night . Just as we were launching a regimental attack , four of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The attack failed . " " What about concealment ! " Alekseyev demanded . " Ask the devil 's mother why it does n't work , " the colonel shot back . " Their radar aircraft can evidently track vehicles on the ground  --  we 've tried jamming , we 've tried lures . Sometimes it works , but sometimes not . The division command post has been attacked twice . My regiments are commanded by majors , my battalions by captains . NATO tactics are to go for the unit commanders , and the bastards are good at it . Every time we approach a village , my tanks have to fight through a swarm of missiles . We 've tried rockets and artillery to suppress them , but you ca n't take the time to blast every building in sight  --  we 'd never get anywhere . " " What do you need ? " " Air support and lots of it . Get me the support to smash through what 's opposing me , and I 'll give you your damned breakout ! " Ten kilometers behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very unit to rupture the front  --  but how could it exploit a breakthrough that was never made ? " Your supply situation ? " " Could be better , but we 're getting enough forward to supply what we have left  --  not enough to support an intact division . " " What are you doing now ? " " We launch a two-regiment attack just over an hour from now . Another  | village , named Bieben . We estimate enemy strength as two understrength battalions of infantry , supported by tanks and artillery . The village commands a crossroads we need . Same one we tried to get last night . This assault should work . Do you wish to observe ? " " Yes . " " Then we 'd better get you forward . Forget the helicopter unless you want to die . Besides " ? the colonel smiled ? " I can use it to support the attack . I 'll give you an infantry carrier to get you forward . It will be dangerous up there , Comrade General , " the colonel warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do we leave ? " USS PHARRIS The calm sea meant that Pharris was back on port-and-starboard steaming . Half the crew was always on duty as the frigate held her station north of the convoy . The towed sonar was streamed aft , and the helicopter sat ready on the flight deck , its crew dozing in the hangar . Morris slept also , snoring away in his leather bridge chair , to the amusement of his crewmen . So , officers did it , too . The crew accommodations often sounded like a convention of chainsaws . " Captain , message from CINCLANTFLT . " Morris looked up at the yeoman and signed for the message form . An eastbound convoy one hundred fifty miles north of them was under attack . He walked back to the chart table to check distances . The submarines there were not a threat to him . That was that . He had his own concerns , and his world had shrunk to include them only . Another forty hours to Norfolk , where they would refuel , replace expended ordnance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's that ? " a sailor said loudly . He pointed to a low-lying trail of white smoke . " That 's a missile , " answered the officer of the deck . " General quarters ! Captain , that was a cruise missile southbound a mile ahead of us . " Morris snapped upright in his seat and blinked his eyes clear . " Signal the convoy . Energize the radar . Fire the chaff . " Morris ran to the ladder to CIC . The ship 's alarm was sounding its strident note before he got there . Aft , two Super-RBOC chaff rockets leaped into the sky and exploded , surrounding the frigate with a cloud of aluminum foil . " I count five inbounds , " a radar operator was saying . One 's heading towards us . Bearing zero-zero-eight , range seven miles , speed five hundred knots . " " Bridge , come right full rudder to zero-zero-eight , " the tactical action officer ordered . " Stand by to fire off more chaff . Air action forward , weapons free . "  | The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which came near the incoming missile . " Range two miles and closing , " reported the radarman . " Fire four more Super-RBOCs . " Morris heard the rockets launch . The radar showed their chaff as an opaque cloud that enveloped the ship . " CIC , " called a lookout . " I see it . Starboard bow , inbound  --  it 's gon na miss , I got a bearing change . There  --  there it goes , passing aft . Missed us by a couple hundred yards . " The missile was confused by the chaff . Had its brain had the capacity to think , it would have been surprised that it struck nothing . Instead , on coming back to a clear sky , the radar seeker merely looked for another target . It found one , fifteen miles ahead , and altered course toward it . " Sonar , " Morris ordered , " check bearing zero-zero-eight . There 's a missile-armed sub out there . " " Looking now , sir . Nothing shows on that bearing . " " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty miles out , " Morris said . " Get the helo out there . I 'm going topside . " The captain reached the bridge just in time to see the explosion on the horizon . That was no freighter . The fireball could only mean a warship had had her magazines exploded by a missile , perhaps the one that had just missed them . Why had n't they been able to stop it ? Three more explosions followed . Slowly the noise traveled across the sea toward them , reaching Pharris as the deep sound of an enormous bass drum . The frigate 's Sea Sprite helicopter was just lifting off , racing north in the hope of catching the Soviet sub near the surface . Morris ordered his ship to slow to five knots in the hope that the lower speed would allow his sonar to perform just a little better . Still nothing . He returned to CIC . The helicopter 's crew dropped a dozen sonobuoys . Two showed something , but the contact faded , and was not reestablished . Soon an Orion showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had escaped cleanly , her missiles having killed a destroyer and two merchantmen . Just like that , Morris thought . No warning at all . STORNOWAY , SCOTLAND " Raid warning again , " the Group Captain said . " Realtime ? " Toland asked . " No , an asset we have in Norway . Contrails overhead heading southwest . He counts twenty or so , aircraft type unknown . We have a Nimrod patrolling north of Iceland now . If they 're Backfires , and if they rendezvous with a tanker group , we might just get something . See if your idea works , Bob . " Four Tomcat interceptors were sitting ready on the flight line . Two were  | armed with missiles . The other pair carried buddy-stores , fuel tanks designed to transfer fuel to other aircraft . The distance they expected for a successful intercept meant a round trip of two thousand miles , which meant that only two aircraft could reach far enough , and they were stretching to the limit . The Nimrod circled two hundred miles east of Jan Mayen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air attacks , destroying the radar there , though so far the Russians had not launched a ground attack as expected . The British patrol aircraft bristled with antennae but carried no armament of her own . If the Russians sent escorting fighters out with the bomber/tanker force , she could only evade . One team listened in on the bands used by the Russians to communicate between aircraft , another on radar frequencies . It was a long , tense wait . Two hours after the raid warning , a garbled transmission was heard , interpreted as a warning to a Backfire pilot approaching a tanker . The bearing was plotted , and the Nimrod turned east hoping for a cross bearing on the next such signal . None was detected . Without a firm fix , the fighters had only the slimmest hope of an intercept . They were kept on the ground . Next time , they decided , there 'd be a pair of snoopers up . USS CHICAGO The QZB bell-ringer call arrived just after lunch . McCafferty brought his submarine to antenna depth and received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base in Scotland . Since losing contact with the Russian surface force , they had not tracked a single positive contact . It was crazy . All the pre-war assessments told McCafferty to expect a " target-rich environment . " So far he was rich only in frustration . The executive officer took them back down to a deep cruising depth while McCafferty began to write up his patrol report . BIEBEN , FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY " You 're pretty exposed here , " the captain observed , crouching just behind the turret . " True enough , " Sergeant Mackall agreed . His M-1 Abrams tank was dug into the reverse slope of a hill , its gun barely clear of the ground behind a row 4 of shrubs . Mackall looked down a shallow valley to a treeline fifteen hundred meters away . The Russians were in there , surveying the ridges with powerful field glasses , and he hoped that they could not make out the squat , ominous profile of the main battle tank . He was in one of three prepared firing positions , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulldozers ,  | helped over the last few days by local German farmers who had taken to the task with a will . The bad news was that the next line of such positions required traversing five hundred meters of open fields . They 'd been planted with something a bare six weeks before . Those crops would never amount to much , the sergeant knew . " Ivan must love this weather , " Mackall observed . There was an overcast at about thirteen hundred feet . Whatever air support he could expect would have a bare five seconds to acquire and engage their targets before having to break clear of the battlefield . " What can you give us , sir ? " " I can call four A-10s , maybe some German birds , " the Air Force captain replied . He surveyed the terrain himself from a slightly different perspective . What was the best way to get the ground-attack fighters in and out ? The first Russian attack on this position had been repulsed , but he could see the remains of two NATO aircraft that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three choppers , too . " That surprised Mackall  --  and worried him . Just what sort of attack were they expecting here ? " Okay . " The captain stood and turned back to his armored command vehicle . " When you hear Zulu , Zulu , Zulu , ' that means the air is less than five minutes out . If you see any SAM vehicles or antiair guns , for Christ 's sake take them out . The Warthogs have been hit real hard , Sarge . " " You got it , Cap'n . You better get your ass outa here , it 's gon na be showtime soon . " One thing Mackall had learned was just how important a good forward air-control officer was , and this one had dug the sergeant 's troop out of a really bad scrape three days before . He watched the officer sprint fifty yards to the waiting vehicle , its engine already turning . The rear door had n't yet closed when the driver pulled out fast , zigzagging down the slope and across the plowed field toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment had once been fourteen tanks . Five of the originals were gone , and there had been only two replacements . Of the rest , all had been damaged to one degree or another . His platoon leader had been killed on the second day of the war , leaving Mackall in command of the three-tank platoon , covering nearly a kilometer of front . Dug in between his tanks was a company of German infantry  --  men of the Landwehr , the local equivalent of the National Guard , farmers and shopowners for the most part , men fighting to defend not just their country , but their own homes . They , too , had taken serious losses . The " company " was no more than two platoons of effectives . Surely the Russians know just how thin we 're spread , Mackall thought . Everyone was dug in  --  deep . The power of Russian artillery had come as a shock despite all the pre-war warnings they 'd had .  | " The Americans must love this . " The colonel gestured at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in too low for our radar , and this way we have practically no chance to see them before they fire . " " How badly have they hurt you ? " " See for yourself . " The colonel gestured at the battlefield . Fifteen tanks lay in view  --  the burned-out remains . " That American low-level fighter did this  --  the Thunderbolt . Our men call it the Devil 's Cross . " " But you killed two aircraft yesterday , " Sergetov objected . " Yes , and only one of four gun vehicles survived the effort . The same vehicle got both  --  Senior Sergeant Lupenko . I recommended him for the Red Banner . It will be posthumous  --  the second aircraft crashed right on his vehicle . My best gunner , " the colonel said bitterly . Two kilometers away , the wreckage of a German Alphajet was a charred garnish atop the remains of a ZSU-30 gun vehicle . No doubt it had been deliberate , the colonel thought , that German had wanted to kill just a few more Soviets before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The officer listened for half a minute before speaking a few words that he punctuated with a quick nod . " Five minutes , Comrades . My men are fully in place . Would you follow me , please ? " The command bunker had been hastily built of logs and earth , with a full meter of overhead cover . Twenty men were crammed into it , communications men for the two regiments in the assault . The division 's third regiment waited to exploit the breakthrough and pave the way for the reserve armored division to break into the enemy 's rear . If , Alekseyev reminded himself , everything went as planned . No enemy troops or vehicles could be seen , of course . They would be in the woods atop the ridge less than two kilometers away , dug in deep . He watched the divisional commander nod to his artillery chief , who lifted a field phone and spoke two words : " Commence firing . " It took several seconds for the sound to reach them . Every gun the division owned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one dreadful voice , and the thunder echoed across the countryside . The shells arched overhead , at first striking short of the opposite ridgeline , then closing on it . What had once been a gentle hill covered with lush grass turned into a brown obscenity of bare earth and smoke . " I think they 're serious , Sarge , " the loader said , pulling his hatch down tight . Mackall adjusted his helmet and microphone as he peered out the view  | ports built into his commander 's cupola . The thick armor plate kept most of the noise out , but when the ground shook beneath them , the shock came through the treads and suspension to rock the vehicle , and each crewman reflected to himself on the force needed to budge a sixty-ton tank . This was how the lieutenant had bought it  --  a one-in-a-thousand shot from a heavy gun had landed a round right on his turret , and it had burrowed through the thin overhead armor to explode the vehicle . Left and right of Mackall 's tank , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes , their emotions oscillating between terror and rage at what was happening to them and their country  --  and their homes ! " Good fire plan , Comrade Colonel , " Alekseyev said quietly . A screaming sound passed overhead . " There is your air support . " Four Russian ground-attack fighters wheeled overhead to trace parallel to the ridgeline and dropped their loads of napalm . As they turned back toward Russian lines , one exploded in midair . " What was that ? " " Probably a Roland , " the colonel answered . " Their version of our SA-8 rocket . Here we go . One minute . " Five kilometers behind the command bunker , two batteries of mobile rocket launchers ripple-fired their weapons in a continuous sheet of flame . Half were high-explosive warheads , the other half smoke . Thirty rockets landed in Mackall 's sector and thirty in the valley before him . The impact of the explosives shook his tank violently , and he could hear the pings of fragments bouncing off his armor . But it was the smoke that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty separate points , graywhite smoke billowed into the air , forming an instant man-made cloud that enveloped all the ground in view . Mackall and his gunner activated their thermal-imaging sights . " Buffalo , this is Six , " the troop commander called in over the command circuit . " Check in . " Mackall listened in closely . All eleven vehicles were intact , protected by their deep holes . Again he blessed the engineers  --  and the German farmers ? who had dug the shelters . No further orders were passed . None were needed . " Enemy in view , " the gunner reported . The thermal sight measured differences in temperature and could penetrate most of the mile of smoke cover . And the wind was on their side . A tenmile-per-hour breeze was driving the cloud back east . Sergeant first ( ' lass ' Ferry Mackall took a deep breath and went to work .  | " Target tank , ten o'clock . Sabot ! Shoot ! " The gunner trained left and centered the sight reticle on the nearest Soviet battle tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin beam of light bounced off the target . The range display came up in his sight : 1310 meters . The fire-control computer plotted target distance and speed , elevating the main gun . The computer measured wind speed and direction , air density and humidity , the temperature of the air , and the tank 's own shells , and all the gunner had to do was place the target in the center of his sights . The whole operation took less than two seconds , and the gunner 's fingers jammed home on the triggers . A forty-foot muzzle blast annihilated the shrubs planted two years earlier by some German Boy Scouts . The tank 's 105mm gun jerked back in recoil , ejecting the spent aluminum case . The shell came apart in the air , the sabot falling free of the projectile , a 40mm dart made of tungsten and uranium that lanced through the air at almost a mile a second . The projectile struck the target one second later at the base of the gun turret . Inside , a Russian gunner was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uranium core of the shot burned through the protective steel . The Russian tank exploded , its turret flying thirty feet into the air . " Hit ! " Mackall said . " Target tank , twelve o'clock . Sabot ! Shoot ! " The Russian and American tanks fired at the same instant , but the Russian shot went high , missing the defiladed M-1 by nearly a meter . The Russian was less lucky . " Time to leave , " Mackall announced . " Straight back ! Heading for alternate one . " The driver already had reverse engaged , and twisted hard on his throttle control . The tank surged backward , then spun right and headed fifty yards to another prepared position . " Damned smoke ! " Sergetov swore . The wind blew it back in their faces , and they could n't tell what was going on . The battle was now in the hands of captains , lieutenants , and sergeants . All they could see was the orange fireballs of exploding vehicles , and there was no way to know whose they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and was barking orders to his subunit commanders . Mackall was in his first alternate position in less than a minute . This one had been dug parallel to the ridgeline , and his massive turret trained to the left . lie could see the infantry now , dismounted and running ahead of their assault carriers . Allied artillery , both German and American , ripped through their ranks , but not quickly enough . .  | " Target  --  tank with an antenna , just coming out of the treeline . " " Got ' em ! " the gunner answered . He saw a Russian T-80 main battle tank with a large radio antenna projecting from the turret . That would be a company commander  --  maybe a battalion commander . He fired . The Russian tank wheeled just as the shot left the muzzle . Mackall watched the tracer barely miss his engine compartment . " Gim me a HEAT round ! " the gunner shouted over the intercom . " Ready ! " " Turn back , you mother ? " The Russian tank was driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley floor . He jinked every five seconds , and now brought his tank left again The gunner squeezed off his round . The tank jumped at the recoil and the spent round clanged off the turret 's rear wall . Already the closed tank hull stank of the ammonia-based propellant . " Hit ! Nice shot , Woody ! " The shell hit the Russian between the last pair of road wheels and wrecked the tank 's diesel engine . In a moment the crew began to bail out , " escaping " into an environment alive with shell fragments . Mackall ordered his driver to move again . By the time they were in their next firing position , the Russians were less than five hundred meters away . They fired two more shots , killing an infantry carrier and knocking the tread off a tank . " Buffalo , this is Six , begin moving to Bravo Line  --  execute . " As platoon leader , Mackall was the last to leave . He saw both of his companion tanks rolling down the open reverse slope of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armored carriers , or just running . " Friendly " artillery blanketed the ridgeline with high explosives and smoke to mask their withdrawal . On command , the tank leaped forward , accelerating to thirty miles per hour and racing to the next defense line before the Russians could occupy the ridge they were leaving behind . Artillery fire was all over them , exploding a pair of German personnel carriers . " Zulu , Zulu , Zulu ! " " Get me a vehicle ! " Alekseyev ordered . " I can not permit this . I can not let a general ? " " Get me a damned vehicle ! I must observe this , " Alekseyev repeated . A minute later , he and Sergetov joined the colonel in a BMP armored command vehicle that raced to the position the NATO troops had just vacated . They found a hole that had sheltered two men  --  until a rocket had landed a meter away . " My God , we 've lost twenty tanks here ! " Sergetov said , looking hack.  | " Down ! " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm of NATO shells landed on the ridge . " There 's a Gatling gun ! " the gunner said . A Russian antiaircraft gun carrier came over the ridge . A moment later a HEAT round exploded it like a plastic toy . His next target was a Russian tank coming down the hill they 'd just left . " Heads up , friendly air coming in ! " Mackall cringed , hoping the pilot could tell the sheep from the goats . Alekseyev watched the twin-engine fighter swoop straight down the valley . Its nose disappeared in a mass of flame as the pilot fired his antitank cannon . Four tanks exploded before his eyes as the Thunderbolt appeared to stagger in midair , then turned west , a missile chasing after him . The SA-7 fell short . " The Devil 's Cross ? " he asked . The colonel nodded in reply , and Alekseyev realized where the name had come from . From an angle , the American fighter did look like the stylized Russian Orthodox crucifix . " I just called up the reserve regiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colonel said . This , Sergetov thought incredulously to himself , is a successful attack ? Mackall watched a pair of antitank missiles reach out into the Russian lines . One miss , one kill . More smoke came in from both sides as the NATO troops fell back another five hundred meters . The village they were defending was now in sight . The sergeant had counted a total of five kills to his tank . He had n't been hit yet , but that would n't last . The friendly artillery was really in the fight now . The Russian infantry was down to half the strength he 'd first seen , and their tracked vehicles were laying back , trying to engage the NATO positions with their own missiles . Things looked to be going reasonably well when the third regiment appeared . Fifty tanks came over the hill in front of him . An A-10 swept across the line and killed a pair , then was blotted out of the sky by a SAM . The burning wreckage fell three hundred yards in front of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Abrams rocked backward with yet another shot . " Hit . " " Warning , warning , " called the troop commander . " Enemy choppers approaching from the north . " Ten Mi-24 Hinds arrived late , but they made up for it by killing a pair of tanks in less than a minute . German Phantom jets then appeared , engaging them with air-to-air missiles and cannon in a wild melee that suddenly  | included surface-to-air missiles also . The sky was crisscrossed with smoke trails , and suddenly there were no aircraft in view . " It 's bogging down , " Alekseyev said . He 'd just learned one important lesson : attack helicopters can not hope to survive in the face of enemy fighters . Just when he thought the Mi-24s would make a decisive difference , they 'd been forced away by the appearance of the German fighters . Artillery support was slacking off . The NATO gunners were counterbatterying the Soviet guns expertly , helped by ground-attack fighters . He had to get more front-line air support . " The hell it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders to the battalions on his left flank . " Looks like a command vehicle at ten o'clock , on the ridgeline , can you reach it ? " " Long shot , I ? " Whang ! A shot glanced off the turret 's face . " Tank , three o'clock , close in ? " The gunner turned his yoke controls and nothing happened . Immediately he reached for the manual traverse . Mackall engaged the target with his machine gun , bouncing bullets off the advancing T-80 that had come out of nowhere . The gunner cranked frantically at the handle as another round crashed into their armor . The driver aided him , turning the vehicle and praying that they could return the fire . The computer was out , damaged by the shock of the first hit . The T-80 was less than a thousand meters away when the gunner settled on it . He fired a HEAT round , and it missed . The loader slammed another home in the breech . The gunner worked his controls and fired again . Hit . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Buffalo Six , this is three-one , bad guys coming in from our flank . We need help here , " Mackall called ; then to the driver : " Left track and back up fast ! " The driver needed no encouragement . He cringed , looking out his tiny viewing prisms , and rocked the throttle handle all the way back . The tank raced backward and left as the gunner tried to lock onto another target  --  but the automatic stabilization was also out . They had to sit still to fire accurately , and it was death to sit still . Another Thunderbolt came in low , dropping cluster munitions on the Russian formation . Two more Soviet tanks were stopped , but the fighter went away trailing smoke . Artillery fire joined in to stop the Soviet maneuver.  | " For Christ 's sake , stop so I can shoot one of the fuckers ! " the gunner screamed . The tank stopped at once . He fired , hitting a T-72 on the tread . " Reload ! " A second tank joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was intact and fired off three quick rounds for two hits . Then a Soviet helicopter reappeared and exploded the troop commander 's tank with a missile . A shoulder-fired Stinger missile then killed the chopper as the German infantry redeployed . Mackall watched a pair of HOT antitank missiles go left and right of his turret , reaching for the advancing Soviets . Both hit . " Antenna tank , dead ahead . " " I see him . Sabot ! " the gunner cranked the turret back to the right . He elevated his gun to battle sights and fired . " Captain Alexandrov ! " the division commander shouted into his microphone . The battalion commander 's transmission had stopped in midword . The colonel was using his radio too much . Ten miles away , a German battery of 155mm mobile guns tracked in on the radio signals and fired twenty quick rounds . Alekseyev heard the incoming and jumped into a German-dug foxhole , dragging Sergetov with him . Five seconds later the area was blanketed by smoke and noise . The General stuck his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving radio orders . Behind him the command vehicle was burning , the radios with it . Five men were dead , another half-dozen screaming with the pain of their injuries . Alekseyev looked with annoyance at a bloody streak on the back of his hand . Mackall killed one more tank , but it was the Germans who stopped the attack , using the last of their HOT missiles to do so . The remaining Russian commander lost his nerve when half the tanks in the battalion were hit . The survivors turned on their smoke generators and retreated back around the hill to the south . Artillery chased after them . The land battle was over for the moment . " Mackall , what 's happening down your way ? " the troop executive officer inquired . " Where 's Six ? " " To your left . " Mackall looked and saw the troop commander 's burning tank . So that 's who it was . . . " Just us , sir . What 's left ' ? " " " I count four . " Mv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Regiment from the tank division and I can do it . They have nothing left ! " the colonel insisted . His face was bloody from a superficial wound . " I will do this . How soon can you continue the attack ? " Alekseyev asked . " Two hours . I need that long to regroup my forces . " " Very well . I must return to headquarters . The enemy opposition was tougher than you expected , Comrade Colonel . Otherwise your forces performed well . Tell your intelligence section to work harder . Gather up your prisoners and interrogate them rigorously ! " Alekseyev moved off with Sergetov in his wake . " Worse than I expected , " the captain observed once they were inside their vehicle . " They must have had nearly a Regiment facing us . " Alekseyev shrugged . " We ca n't make that kind of mistake very often and expect to succeed . We advanced four kilometers in two hours , but the cost was murderous . And those bastards in the Air Force ! I 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back ! " " That makes you troop XO , " the lieutenant said . It turned out there were five surviving tanks . One had both radios broken . " You did good , real good . " " How 'd the Germans make out ? " Mackall asked his new boss . " Fifty-percent losses , and Ivan kicked us back four klicks . We ca n't expect to survive much more of this . We may have some reinforcements in an hour . I think I convinced Regiment that Ivan really wants this place . We 'll be getting help . Same for the Germans . They promised another battalion by nightfall , maybe a second one by dawn . Take your track down for refuel and reload . Our friends may be back soon . " " That 's one little and two big attacks for this village . They ai n't got it yet , sir . " " One other thing . I talked to Regiment about you . The colonel says you 're an officer now . " Mackall 's tank spent ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes while the exhausted crewmen loaded a new collection of shells . The sergeant was surprised that he had to head back to the front five rounds short . " You 've been hit , Pasha . " The younger man shook his head . " I scratched my hand getting out of the helicopter . I 'll let it bleed awhile to punish myself for clumsiness . " Alekseyev sat opposite his commander and  | downed a full liter canteen of water . He was embarrassed by his slight wound and decided to lie about it . " The attack ? " " Opposition was ferocious . We 'd been told to expect two infantry battalions , plus tanks . I estimate the actual enemy strength as a damaged regiment , and they had well-prepared positions . Even so , we almost broke through . The colonel in command had a good plan , and his men pushed as hard as anyone could expect . We forced them back to within sight of the objective . I want to release a regiment of tanks from the OMG to the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . " " What ? " Alekseyev was stunned . " The Operational Maneuver Groups are to remain intact until the breakthrough is achieved . Orders from Moscow . " " One more regiment will do it . The objective is in sight ! We 've chewed up one motor rifle division to get this far , and lost half the strength of another . We can win this battle and get the first major rupture in NATO lines  --  but we have to act now ! " " You 're certain ? " " Yes , but we must move fast . The Germans must realize how close this battle has become . They 'll try to reinforce also . The lead regiment from 30th Guards Tank Division is one hour from the front . If we can get them moving within thirty minutes , they 'll be part of the next attack . In fact , we should move the whole division up . This opportunity will not last long . " " Very well . I 'll call STAVKA for permission . " Alekseyev leaned back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deviate from the Plan , even a Theater commander had to get permission ! It took over an hour while the staff geniuses in Moscow examined the maps . The lead regiment of 30th Guards was released and ordered to join the motor-rifle division in the next attack . But they were late , and the attack was delayed ninety minutes . Second Lieutenant Terry Mackall  --  he still wore his stripes and was too tired to care about his change in rank  --  wondered how seriously Command was taking this little tank battle . Two battalions of German regulars arrived in tracked vehicles , relieving the exhausted Landwehr men , who moved back to prepare defensive positions in and around the village to their rear . A company of Leopard tanks and two platoons of M- 1 s reinforced the position , with a German colonel in overall command . He arrived by helicopter and surveyed all the defensive positions . A tough-looking little bastard , Mackall thought , with some bandages on his face and a tight unsmiling mouth . Mackall remembered that if Ivan broke through here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and British forces that had stopped the Russians ' deepest penetration at the suburbs of Hannover . That made the battle important to the Germans . The German Leopards took the frontal positions , relieving the Americans . It was a full troop now , back to fourteen vehicles . The troop commander split the force into two parts , with Mackall commanding the southern group . They found the last line of dug shelters , just southeast of the village . Mackall arrayed his newly assigned command with care , checking each position on foot and conferring with each tank commander . The Germans were thorough enough . Any position that did not already have natural shrubbery in place had had it transplanted in . Nearly all of the civilians who lived here had been evacuated , but a handful of people were unwilling to desert the homes they 'd built . One of them brought some of the tankers hot food . Mackall 's crew did n't have time to eat it . The gunner repaired two loose connectors and reset the balky fire-control computer . The loader and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around them before they finished . Alekseyev wanted to be there . He had a telephone link with the division , and listened in on the division command circuit . The colonel  --  Alekseyev wanted to make him a general if the attack succeeded  --  complained that they had been forced to wait too long . He 'd asked for and gotten a reconnaissance mission over enemy lines . One of the aircraft had vanished . The other 's pilot reported movement , but could not provide a strength estimate , so busy had he been dodging surface-to-air missiles . The colonel feared there had been an increase in enemy strength , but without hard evidence could not justify either II a further delay or further reinforcements . Mackall also watched from a distance . The last row of hills was a mile away , across what had been a farm but was now covered mostly with small trees , as though the soil had been exhausted . His forces were organized in two threetank platoons . As commander , his job was to lie back and direct them by radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance , he began to see movement . German personnel carriers began streaming down the hill , toward the village . Some Soviet helicopters appeared to the north , but this time a Roland battery hidden in the village engaged them , exploding three before they retreated out of sight . Next came the German Leopard tanks . Mackall counted and came up three short . NATO artillery pounded the hilltops , and Soviet guns dropped shells in the fields around the American tanks . Then the Russians appeared .  | " Buffalo , all units hold fire . Repeat , everyone hold fire , " the troop commander said over the radio . Mackall saw that the retreating Germans were passing through the village . So , that 's what that little Kraut bastard has planned , he thought . Beautiful .. . " We have them on the run ! " the colonel told Alekseyev over the command circuit . On the map table in front of the General , counters were moved and plotting officers made marks with grease pencils . They penciled in a red gap in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five hundred meters from the village , racing down the two-kilometer gap between B-Troop 's tanks . The German colonel gave his order to the American troop commander . " Buffalo , this is Six  --  take ' em ! " Twelve tanks fired at once and hit nine targets . " Woody , look for antennas , " Mackall ordered his gunner . He used his viewing prisms to keep an eye on his subordinates as the gunner traversed right and searched the rear Soviet ranks . " There 's one ! Load a HEAT round ! Target tank . Range twenty-six hundred ? " The tank lurched sideways . The gunner watched the tracer on the shell arc through the air on its two-mile path ... " Hit ! " The second volley from the M-1s killed eight tanks , then others began to explode from antitank missiles launched out of the village . The Russians had defiladed tanks on their flanks , and in front of them was a village bristling with antitank missiles : the German colonel had set a moving ambush , and the pursuing Russians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around left and right from behind the village to catch the Russians in the open . The air-control officer brought his fighter-bombers in on the Soviet artillery positions yet again . Soviet fighters engaged them , but while doing that they could not interfere with the land battle , and now a squadron of German Gazelle missile-armed choppers added their fire into the killing ground . The Soviet tanks fired off smoke and desperately tried to engage their enemies , but the Americans were dug in deep , and the German missileers in the village skillfully changed firing points after every shot . Mackall shifted one platoon right and the other left . His own gunner located and killed a second command tank , then the Germans enveloped the Russian formation from north and south . Still outnumbered , the Germans nevertheless caught the Russians off balance , raking the tank column with their big I20mm gun tubes . The Soviet commander ordered his helicopters hack in to blast open an escape route . They surprised and killed three German tanks before missiles began to drop them from the sky yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched , the Soviet force wheeled and re-  | treated toward the hills , with the Germans in pursuit . The counterattack was pressed to the limit , and Mackall knew that nobody did that as well as the Krauts . By the time he had orders to move , the initial defense position was back in friendly hands . The battle had lasted barely over an hour . Two Soviet motor-rifle divisions had now been decimated on the road to Bieben . The crewmen opened their hatches to let fresh air into the stifling turret . Fifteen empty cases rattled about on the floor . The fire-control computer was out again , but Woody had killed another four tanks , two of them belonging to Soviet officers . The troop commander came over to him in a jeep . " Three tanks damaged , " Mackall reported . " Have to drag them clear for repairs . " His face split into a wide grin : " They ai n't never gon na take this town away from us ! " " Those Bundeswehr regulars made the difference . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people reloaded . " " Oh , yeah . Last time I came back five rounds short . " " They 're thinning out the ammo issue . It 's not getting across to us as quick as we thought . " Mackall thought that one over and did n't like what he came up with . " Have somebody tell those Navy pukes that we can stop these bastards if they get their shit together ! " USS PHARRIS Morris had never seen Hampton Roads so crowded . At least sixty merchantmen were swinging at anchor , with a beefed-up escort force preparing to take them to sea . Saratoga was in also , her mainmast gone and a replacement being fabricated on the quay while repairs were under way for less visible damage from her near-miss . Numerous aircraft circled overhead , and several ships had their search radars on lest a Soviet submarine sneak close inshore and launch cruise missiles into the mass of shipping . Pharris was tied to the fueling pier , taking on fuel oil for her boilers and jet fuel for her helicopter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as had the six chaff rockets . Aside from that , the only thing that needed to be taken aboard was food . Ed Morris handed his patrol report to a messenger who would deliver it to his squadron commander . He would have gone himself , but there was no time . They were scheduled to sail in another twelve hours . This was another twenty-knot convoy , bound for the French ports of LeHavre and Brest with heavy equipment and munitions . Morris had been given the fleet intelligence report . If anything , matters had gotten worse . Twenty NATO submarines were now staked out in the GI-UK gap , trying to make up for the loss of the SOSUS line . They reported killing a sizable number of Soviet submarines , but they also reported that some had gotten through , and for each known leaker , Morris was sure that  | there were four or five unknowns . The first convoy had gotten virtually a free ride . Those few Soviet submarines in the Atlantic at the time had been spread thin , and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer . About sixty were thought to be in the Atlantic now , at least half of them nuclear-powered . Morris thought over the numbers , what the Soviet inventory was , how many kills NATO claimed , and wondered if sixty was an optimistic assessment . Then there were the Backfires . The convoy would be taking a southerly routing , adding two full days to the crossing time but forcing the Soviet bombers to stretch to the limit of their fuel . Also , thirty minutes before each satellite pass , the convoy would reverse course to a westerly heading in the hope that the Soviets would then vector their bombers and submarines to the wrong point . A pair of carrier battle groups was at sea and would offer support if possible . Clearly they wanted to spring a trap on the Backfires . The carrier groups would be steaming an evasive path , trying to avoid satellite detection entirely . Morris knew this was possible , an exercise in geometry , but it placed serious limits on the carriers ' freedom of action  --  and having the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antisubmarine patrol aircraft that the convoys depended on . A compromise , but then all life , and certainly any war operation , was a collection of compromises . Morris lit an unfiltered cigarette . He 'd broken the habit years before , but halfway through the outbound leg of his first war cruise he 'd found himself at the ship 's store purchasing a carton of tax-free " at sea " smokes . The added hazard to his health , he judged , was no more than incidental . Already nine destroyers and frigates had been sunk , two with all hands . ICELAND Edwards had learned to hate the rust-colored contour lines on his maps . Each one announced a change of twenty meters . He tried to work it out in his head , but got no further than sixty-five-point-six feet for every one of the Goddamned red-brown lines . Sometimes the lines were spread apart by as much as an eighth of an inch . Other times they were packed together tightly enough that the lieutenant half expected to find a sheer wall . He remembered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the time he and his father had scornfully walked past the tourists lined up to wait for an elevator ride to the top of the Washington Monument , preferring to walk the five hundred feet up the square-spiral staircase to the observation deck . They 'd arrived at the top tired but proud . He was now making that same climb about every ninety minutes , except this time there were no smooth , even steps , and no elevator awaited them at the top for a more relaxing trip down . . . and no taxi to the hotel . They climbed ten contour lines  --  two hundred meters , or six hundred  | fifty-six feet  --  three hours after breaking camp ; crossing , the map said , from the Skorradalshreppur second-order administrative division to the Lundarreykjadashreppur second-order administrative division . There was no green highway sign to announce this , the Icelanders being bright enough to know that anyone who traveled out here lived here and needed no directions . They were rewarded with two kilometers of fairly level terrain as they walked between a pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what seemed to be an extinct volcano about four miles away . " Take a break , " Edwards said . He sat down next to a three-foot rock so that he 'd have something to lean against , and was surprised when Vigdis came over . She sat down three feet away , facing him . " How are you today ? " he asked . There was life in her eyes now , Mike saw . Perhaps the demons that had awakened her the previous day were now gone ? No , he thought , they 'd never be completely gone  --  but you had to be alive to have nightmares , and they would probably fade in time . With time you could recover from anything , except murder . " I have not thank you for my life . " " We could not stand by and let them kill you , " he said , wondering if it was a lie . If the Russians had simply killed all three people in the house , would he have attacked them or would he have waited and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a time for the truth . " I did n't do it for you , not only for you . " " I do not understand . " Edwards took his wallet from a back pocket and opened it to a five-yearold photograph . " That 's Sandy , Sandra Miller . We grew up on the same block , all the way through school . Maybe we would have gotten married someday , " he said quietly . And maybe not , he admitted to himself . People change . " I went to the Air Force Academy , she went to the University of Connecticut in Hartford . October of her second year , she disappeared . She was raped and murdered . They found her a week later in a ditch . The guy who did it  --  they never proved he killed Sandy , but he raped two other girls at the school  --  well , he 's in a mental hospital now . They said he was crazy , was n't really responsible . So someday the docs 'll say he 's cured , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dead . " Edwards looked down at the rocks . " I could n't do anything about that . I 'm not a cop , I was two thousand miles away . But not this time . " His voice showed no emotion at all . " This 11 time was different . " " You love Sandy ? " Vigdis asked . How to answer that one ? Mike wondered . It sure did seem like that , five years ago , did n't it ? But would it have worked out ? You have n't exactly been celibate these last few years , have you ? But it has n't been the same , either , has it ? He looked at the photograph taken three days before Sandy had been killed . It had arrived in his box at Colorado Springs after her death , though  | he had n't known it at the time . Her dark , shoulder-length hair , the tilt of the head , the impish smile that went with an infectious laugh . . . all gone . " Yes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do for her then , yes ? " " Yes , " Edwards lied . I did it for me . " I do not know your name . " " Mike , Michael Edwards . " " You do this for me , Michael . Thank you for my life . " There were the first beginnings of a smile . She placed her hand on his . It was soft and warm .  | KEFLAVIK , ICELAND " At first we thought that they simply drove off the cliff road . We found this in the vehicle . " The major of field police held up the top of a broken bottle of vodka . " But the medical corpsman who collected their personal effects found this . " The major pulled the rubberized sheet off the one body that had been thrown clear when the vehicle hit the rocks . The stab wound in the chest was unmistakable . " And you said that the Icelanders were as peaceful as sheep , Comrade General , " the KGB colonel observed sardonically . The major continued , " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a farm a short distance away whose house was burned to the ground . We found two bodies in the wreckage . Both had been shot . " " Who were they ? " General Andreyev asked . " Impossible to identify the bodies . The only way we knew they were shot was the bullet hole in the sternum , so that was likely done at very close range . I had one of our surgeons look at them . A man and a woman , probably in their middle years . According to a local government official , the farm was occupied by a married couple with one daughter , age " ? the major checked his notes ? " twenty . The daughter has not been found . " " What of the patrol ? "  | " They were southbound on the coast road when they disappeared ? " " No one spotted the fires ? " the KGB colonel asked sharply . " There was heavy rain that night . Both the burning vehicle and the farmhouse were below the horizon for the neighboring observation patrols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset our patrol schedules , and the mountains interfere with radio performance . So when the patrol was late getting in , no particular note was made of it . You ca n't see the vehicle from the road , and as a result they were not spotted until the helicopter flew over it . " The other bodies , how did they die ? " the General wanted to know . " When the vehicle burned , the soldiers ' hand grenades cooked off , with the obvious results . Except for the sergeant here , there is no telling how they died . So far as we can tell , no weapons were taken . All the rifles were there , but some items are unaccounted for : a map case and some other minor things . Possibly they were blown clear of the vehicle by the explosions and fell into the sea , but I doubt this . " " Conclusions ? " " Comrade General , there is not a great deal to go on , but I surmise that the patrol visited the farmhouse , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed the two people who lived there , and burned the house . The daughter is missing . We are searching the area for her body . At some time after this happened , the patrol was surprised and killed by an armed party which then tried to make their deaths look like a vehicle accident . We should assume that there is at least one band of resistance fighters at large . " " I disagree , " the KGB colonel announced . " Not all the enemy troops have been accounted for . I think that your ' resistance fighters ' are probably NATO personnel who escaped when we took Keflavik . They ambushed our troops , then murdered the farm people in the hope of stirring the local population against us . " General Andreyev shared a furtive look with his major of field police . It had been a KGB lieutenant commanding the patrol . The chekisti had insisted that some of their people accompany the roving patrols . Just what he needed , the General thought . Bad enough that his crack paratroopers were consigned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but now they were jailers , too , and in some cases commanded by jailers . So the arrogant young KGB officer  --  he 'd never met a humble one  --  had thought to have himself some fun . Where was the daughter ? The answer to this mystery certainly lay with her . But the mystery was n't the important thing , was it ? " 1 think we should interrogate the local inhabitants to see what they know , " the KGB officer announced . " There are no ' local inhabitants , ' Comrade , " the major answered . " Look at your map . This is an isolated farm . The nearest neighbor is seven kilometers away . "  | " But ? " " Who killed these unfortunates , and why , is unimportant . We have armed enemies out there , " Andreyev said . " This is a military matter , not something for our colleagues in the KGB . 1 ' 11 have a helicopter search the area around the farm . If we find this resistance group , or whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any band of armed enemies . You may interrogate any prisoners we manage to capture , Comrade Colonel . Also , for the moment any KGB officer who accompanies our security patrols will be an observer , not a commander . We can not risk your men in combat situations for which they have not been fully trained . So . Let me talk to my operations officer to see how we will handle the search . Comrades , you did well to bring this to our attention . Dismissed . " The chekist wanted to stay , but KGB or not , he was only a colonel , and the General was exercising his legitimate prerogatives as commander on the scene . An hour later , a Mi-24 attack helicopter lifted off to check the area around the burned farm . STORNOWAY , SCOTLAND " Again ? " Toland asked . " Not a bank holiday , Commander , " the group captain replied . " Two regiments of Backfires departed their bases twenty minutes ago . If we want to catch their tankers , we must move smartly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find and jam enemy radar and radio signals , were climbing to altitude on a northwest heading . Known with backhanded affection as the Queer , the EA-6B 's most striking characteristic was its canopies , inlaid with real gold to protect sensitive onboard instruments against electromagnetic radiation . As the planes climbed , their pilots and electronics officers were already working in their gilt cages . Two hours later they spotted their prey , radioed back the signal bearings  --  and four Tomcats rolled down the runway of Stornoway . NORWEGIAN SEA Cruising at an altitude of thirty-six thousand feet the Tomcats flew racetrackshaped patterns north and south of the predicted course for the Soviet tankers . Their powerful search/missile-guidance radars were shut down . Instead , they swept the skies with a built-in TV camera that could identify aircraft as far as forty miles away . Conditions were ideal , a clear sky with only a few high cirrus clouds ; the fighters left no contrails that might warn another aircraft of their presence . The pilots curved their fighters around the sky , their eyes shifting out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a cycle repeated every ten seconds .  | " Well , lookie here ... " the squadron commander said to his weapons operator . The flight officer in the Tomcat 's back seat centered the TV camera on the aircraft . " Looks like a Badger to me . " " I do n't suppose he 's alone . Let 's wait . " " Roge . " The bomber was over forty miles off . Soon two more appeared , along with something smaller . " That 's a fighter . So , they have fighter escorts this far out , eh ? I count a total of . . . six targets . " The weapons operator tightened up his shoulder straps , then activated his missile controls . " All weapons armed and ready . Fighters first ? " " Fighters first , light ' em up , " the pilot agreed . He toggled up his radio . " Two , this is Lead , we have four tankers and a pair of fighters on a course of about zero-eight-five , forty miles west of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over . " " Roger that . On the way , Lead . Out . " Two brought his interceptor into a tight turn and advanced his throttles to the stops . The leader 's radar activated . They now had two fighters and four tankers identified . The first two Phoenixes would be targeted on the fighters . " Shoot ! " The two missiles dropped clear of their shackle points and ignited , leading the Tomcat to the targets . The Russian tankers had detected the fighter 's AWG-9 radar and were already trying to evade . Their escorting fighters went to full power and activated their own missile-guidance radars , only to find that they were still outside missile range to the attacking fighters . Both switched on their jamming pods and began to jink their aircraft up and down as they closed in hope of launching their own missiles . They could n't run away , there was n't enough fuel for that , and their mission was to keep the fighters off the tankers . The Phoenix missiles burned through the air at Mach 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute . One Soviet pilot never saw the missile , and was blotted from the sky in a ball of red and black . The other did , and threw his stick over , a second before the missile exploded . It nearly missed , but fragments tore into the fighter 's port wing . The pilot struggled to regain control as he fell from the sky . Behind the fighters , the tankers split up , two heading north , the other pair south . The lead Tomcat took the northern pair and killed both with his remaining two Phoenixes . His wingman racing up from the north fired two missiles , hitting with one , and missing with the other , as the missile was confused by the Badger 's jamming gear . The Tomcat continued to close , and fired another missile . By this time he was close enough to track the bird  | visually . The AIM-54 missile ran straight and true , exploding only ten feet from the Badger 's tail . Hot fragments ripped into the converted bomber and detonated the remaining fumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thundering orange flash . The fighters swept their radars around the sky , hoping to find targets for their remaining missiles . Six more Badgers were a hundred miles off , but they had already been warned by the leading tankers and were heading north . The Tomcats did n't have enough fuel to pursue . They turned for home and landed at Stornoway an hour later with nearly dry tanks . " Five confirmed kills and a damage , " the squadron commander told Toland . " It worked . " " This time . " Toland was pleased nevertheless . The U.S. Navy had just completed its first offensive mission . Now for the next one . Information was just in on the Backfire raid . They 'd hit a convoy off the Azores , and a pair of Tomcats was waiting two hundred miles south of Iceland to meet them on the return leg . STENDAL , GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC " Our losses have been murderous , " said the General of Soviet Frontal Aviation . " I will tell our motor-rifle troops just how serious your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have lost nearly double our projections . " " So have we ! At least our ground troops are fighting . I watched an attack . You sent in four attack fighters . Four ! " " I know of this attack . There was a full regiment assigned , more than twenty , plus your own attack helicopters . The NATO fighters are engaging us ten kilometers behind the front . My pilots must fight for their lives simply to get where your tanks are  --  and then all too often they are engaged by our own surface-to-air missiles ! " " Explain , " ordered Alekseyev 's superior . " Comrade General , the NATO radar surveillance aircraft are not easy targets  --  they are too well protected . With their airborne radar , they can vector their fighters against ours to launch their missile attacks from beyond visual range . When our pilots learn that they are being attacked , they must evade , no ? Do your tankers sit still to give their enemies an easy shot ? This often means that they must drop their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach the battle zone they are frequently shot at by friendly missile units who do n't take the time to distinguish between friend and foe . " It was an old story , and not merely a Soviet problem . " You are telling us that NATO has command of the air , " Alekseyev said . " No , they do not . Neither side does . Our surface-to-air missiles deny  | them the ability to control the air over the battle line , and their fighters ? helped by their surface-to-air missiles , and ours ! ? deny it to us . The sky over the battlefield belongs to no one . " Except the dead , the Air Force General thought to himself . Alekseyev thought of what he had seen at Bieben , and wondered how correct he was . " We must do better , " the Theater Commander said . " The next massed attack we launch will have proper air support if it means stripping fighters from every unit on the front . " " We are trying to get more aircraft forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NATO 's fighters to the wrong place . It nearly worked , but we made a mistake . That mistake has been identified . " " We attack south of Hannover at 0600 tomorrow . I want two hundred aircraft at the front line supporting my divisions . " " You 'll have them , " the Air Force General agreed . Alekseyev watched the flyer leave . " So , Pasha ? " " That 's a start  --  if the two hundred fighters show up . " " We have our helicopters , too . " " I watched what happens to helicopters in a missile environment . Just when I thought they 'd blast a hole through the German lines , a combination of SAMs and fighters nearly annihilated them . They have to expose themselves too greatly when they fire their missiles . The courage of the pilots is remarkable , but courage alone is not enough . We have underestimated NATO firepower  --  no , more properly we have overestimated our ability to neutralize it . " " We 've been attacking prepared positions since this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes . A mobile campaign will reduce our losses and give us a much more even contest . We have to break through . " Alekseyev looked down at the map . Just after dawn tomorrow , an army  --  four motor-rifle divisions , supported by a division of tanks  --  would hurl itself into the NATO lines . " And here seems to be the place . I want to be forward again . " " As you wish , Pasha . But be careful . By the way , the doctor tells me the cut on your hand was from a shell fragment . You are entitled to a decoration . " " For this ? " Alekseyev looked at his bandaged hand . " I 've cut myself worse than this shaving . No medal for this , it would be an insult to our troops . " ICELAND They were climbing down a rocky slope when the helicopter appeared two miles west of them . It was low , about three hundred feet over the ridge line , and moving slowly toward them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places where they might hide in shadows . Edwards took a few steps to Vigdis and pulled her down also . She was wearing a white patterned sweater that was all too easy to spot . The lieutenant stripped off his field jacket and draped it around her , holding her head down as he wrapped the hood over her blond hair . " Do n't move at all . They 're looking for us . " Edwards kept his own head up briefly to see where his men were . Smith waved for him to get down . Edwards did so , keeping his eyes open so that he could look sideways at the chopper . It was another Hind . He could see rocket pods hanging from stubby wings on either side of the airframe . Both the doors to the passenger compartment were open , revealing a squad of infantrymen , weapons at the ready , looking down . " Oh , shit . " The noise from its turboshaft engines increased as the Hind came closer , and the massive five-bladed main rotor beat at the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plateau they had just left . Edwards 's hand tightened on the M-16 's pistol grip , and he thumbed off the safety . The helicopter was coming almost sideways , its rocket pods pointed at the flatlands behind the Marines . Edwards could make out the machine guns in the Hind 's nose , some kind of rotary gun like the American minigun that spat out four thousand rounds per minute . They would n't have a chance in hell against that . " Turn , you son of a bitch , " Mike said under his breath . " What is it doing ? " Vigdis asked . " Just relax . Do n't move at all . " Oh , God , do n't let them see us now . " There ! Look there at one o'clock , " the gunner said from the front seat of the helicopter . " So this mission is n't a waste after all , " the pilot replied . " Go ahead . " The gunner centered his sights and armed the machine gun , setting his selector for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he depressed the trigger . " Got him ! " Edwards jumped at the sound . Vigdis did n't move at all . The lieutenant moved his rifle slightly , bringing it to bear on the chopper  --  which moved south , dropping below the ridgeline . He saw three heads come up . What had they shot at ? The engine sounds changed as the helicopter landed , not far away . The gunner had hit the buck with three bullets , with little damage to the edible tissue . There was just enough in the eighty-pound animal to feed the squad and the helicopter crew . The paratroop sergeant slit the deer 's throat  | with his combat knife , then set to remove the viscera . The local deer were nothing like the animals his father hunted in Siberia , but for the first time in three weeks he 'd have some fresh meat . That was sufficient to make this boring mission worthwhile . The carcass was loaded into the Hind . Two minutes later it circled up to cruise altitude and flew back to Keflavik . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the breeze . " What was that all about ? " Edwards asked his sergeant . " Beats the hell out of me , skipper . I think we better boogie on outa here . They were sure as hell looking for something , and I 'll betcha it 's us . Let 's keep to places with some kind of cover . " " You got it , Jim . Lead off . " Edwards walked back to Vigdis . " Is safe now ? " " They 've gone . Why do n't you keep that jacket on . It makes you harder to spot . " It was two sizes too large for Edwards , and looked like a tent on Vigdis 's diminutive frame . She held her arms out straight in an effort to get her hands out of the sleeves , and for the first time since he met her , Vigdis Agustdottir smiled . USS PHARRIS " All ahead one-third , " the executive officer ordered . " All ahead one-third , aye , " the quartermaster of the watch responded , moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A moment later the inside pointer changed also . " Engine room answers all ahead onethird . " " Very well . " Pharris slowed , coming off a twenty-five-knot sprint to commence another drift maneuver , and allowing her towed-array sonar to listen for hostile submarines . Morris was in his bridge chair , going over messages from shore . He rubbed his eyes and lit up another Pall Mall . " Bridge , " called the urgent voice of a lookout . " Periscope feather on the port bow ! Halfway to the horizon , port bow ! " Morris snatched his binoculars from the holder and had them to his eyes in an instant . He did n't see anything . " Battle stations ! " ordered the XO . The alarm gong went off a second later and weary men ran again to their posts . Morris looped his binoculars around his neck and ran down the ladder to his battle station in CIC . The sonar loosed a dozen ranging pings to port as Morris took his position in ( ' IC . Nothing . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her towed-array sonar to track on the possible contact .  | " Passive sonar contact , evaluate as possible submarine bearing zero-onethree , " announced the towed-array operator . " Steam noises , sounds like a possible nuke . " " I got nothing there , " said the active-sonar operator . Morris and his ASW officer examined the water-conditions board . There was a layer at two hundred feet . The passive sonar was below it , and could well be hearing a submarine that the active pings could not reach . The lookout might have seen anything from a spouting whale  --  this was the mating season for humpbacks  --  to a streak of foam . . . or the feathery wake left by a periscope . If it was a submarine , he had plenty of time to duck under the layer . The target was too close to be bottom-bounced and too far for the sonar to blast directly through the layer . " Less than five miles , " ASW said . " More than two . If this is a sub , we 're up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the helo on him right now ! " Morris examined the plot . The submarine could have heard his frigate as it sprinted at twenty-five knots . Now , at reduced speed , and with Prairie/Masker operating , Pharris would be very hard to detect . . . so the sub 's fire-control solution had probably just gone out the window . But Morris did n't have one either , and the submarine was perilously close . An urgent contact report was radioed to the screen commander twenty miles away . The Sea Sprite dropped a pattern of sonobuoys . Minutes passed . " I got a weak signal on number six and a medium on number four , " the sonobuoy petty officer said . Morris watched the plot . That made the contact less that three miles off . " Drop some pingers , " he ordered . Behind him the ship 's weapons officer ordered the arming of the ASROC and torpedo launchers . Three miles off , the helicopter turned and swept across the target area , dropping three CASS buoys this time , which sent out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact on buoy nine . Classify as possible submarine . " " I got him , bearing zero-one-five  --  this one 's a sub , classify as positive submarine contact , " said the towed-array man . " He just increased power . Some cavitation sounds . Single-screw submarine , maybe a Victor-class , bearing changing rapidly left-to-right . " The active sonar still did n't have him despite continuous maximumpower pings down the correct line of bearing . The submarine was definitely under the layer . Morris wanted to maneuver but decided against it . A radical turn would cause his towed-array sonar to curve , rendering it useless for several minutes . Then he would have to depend on sonobuoys alone , and Morris trusted his towed sonar more than the buoys . " Bearing to contact is now zero-one-five and steady ... noise level is  | down somewhat . " The operator pointed at his screen . Morris was surprised . The contact bearing had been changing rapidly and was now steadied down ? The helicopter made yet another pass . A new sonobuoy registered the contact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a submarine and the contact was fading . The noise level continued to drop . Morris watched the relative position of the contact pass aft . What the hell was this character doing ? " Periscope , starboard bow ! " the talker reported . " Wrong place , sir ... unless we 're looking at a noisemaker , " the operator said . The ASW officer had the active sonar change bearing and the results were immediate . " Contact bearing three-four-five , range fifteen hundred yards ! " A bright pip glowed on the sonar scope . " All ahead flank ! " Morris yelled . Somehow the submarine had evaded the towed sonar , then popped up atop the layer and run up his periscope . That could only mean one thing . " Right full rudder . " " Hydrophone effects  --  torpedoes inbound , bearing three-five-one ! " Instantly the weapons officer ordered the launch of an antisubmarine torpedo down the same bearing in the hope that it would disturb the attacking submarine . If the Russian 's torpedoes were wire-guided , he 'd have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American return shot . Morris raced up the ladder to the bridge . Somehow the submarine had broken contact and maneuvered into firing position . The frigate changed course and speed in an attempt to ruin the submarine 's fire-control solution . " I see one ! " the XO said , pointing over the bow . The Soviet torpedo left a visible white trail on the surface . Morris noted it , something he had not expected . The frigate turned rapidly . " Bridge , I show two torpedoes , bearing constant three-five-zero and decreasing range , " the tactical action officer said rapidly . " Both are pinging at us . The Nixie is operating . " Morris lifted a phone . " Report the situation to the escort commander . " " Done , skipper . Two more helos are heading this way . " Pharris was now doing twenty knots and accelerating , turning her stern to the torpedoes . Her helicopter was now aft of the beam , frantically making runs with its magnetic anomaly detector , trying to locate the Soviet sub . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Morris 's ship kept her helm over . There was an explosion aft . White water leaped a hundred feet into the air as the first Russian " fish " collided with the nixie torpedo decoy . But they had only one nixie deployed . There was another torpedo out there .  |  " Left full rudder ! " Morris told the quartermaster . " Combat , what about the contact ? " The frigate was now doing twenty-five knots . " Not sure , sir . The sonobuoys have our torp but nothing else . " " We 're gon na take a hit , " the XO said . He pointed to a white trail on the water , less than two hundred yards away . It must have missed the frigate on its first try , then turned for another . Homing torpedoes kept looking until they ran out of fuel . There was nothing Morris could do . The torpedo was approaching on his port bow . If he turned right , it would only give the fish a larger target . Below him the ASROC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but without an order to fire , all the operator could do was train it out . The white wake kept getting closer . Morris leaned over the rail , staring at it with mute rage as it extended like a finger toward his bow . It could n't possibly miss now . " That 's not real smart , Cap'n . " Bosun Clarke 's hand grabbed Morris 's shoulder and yanked him down to the deck . He was just grabbing for the executive officer when it hit . The impact lifted Morris a foot off the steel deck . He did n't hear the explosion , but an instant after he had bounced off the steel a second time , he was deluged with a sheet of white water that washed him against a stanchion . His first thought was that he 'd been thrown overboard . He rose to see his executive officer  --  headless , slumped against the pilothouse door . The bridge wing was torn apart , the stout metal shielding ripped by fragments . The pilothouse windows were gone . What he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just aft of the bow-mounted sonar . Already the bow had collapsed , the keel sundered by the explosion . The foc's'l was awash , and the horrible groaning of metal told him that the bow was being ripped off his ship . Morris staggered into the bridge and yanked the annunciator handle to All Stop , failing to notice that the engineers had already stopped engines . The ship 's momentum pushed her forward . As Morris watched , the bow twisted to starboard , ten degrees off true , and the forward gunmount became awash , its crew trying to head aft . Below the mount were other men . Morris knew that they were dead , hoped that they had died instantly , and were not drowning , trapped in a sinking steel cage . His men . How many had their battle stations forward of the ASROC launcher ? Then the bow tore away . A hundred feet of the ship left the remainder to the accompaniment of screeching metal . It turned as he watched , colliding with the afterpart of the ship as it rotated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement at an exposed watertight door . He saw a man try to get free , and succeed , the figure jumping into the water and swimming away from the wallowing how . The bridge crew was alive , all cut by flying glass but at their posts . ( ' hicf  | Clarke took a quick look at the pilothouse , then ran below to assist with damage control . The damage-control parties were already racing forward with fire hoses and welding gear , and at damage-control central the men examined the trouble board to see how severe the flooding was . Morris lifted a sound-powered phone and twisted the dial to this compartment . " Damage-control report ! " " Flooding aft to frame thirty-six , but I think she 'll float  --  for a little while anyway . No fires . Waiting for reports now . " Morris switched settings on the phone . " Combat , radio the screen commander that we 've taken a hit and need assistance . " " Done , sir . Gallery 's heading out this way . Looks like the sub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have some shock damage here . All the radars are down . Bow sonar is out . ASROC is out . The tail is still working , though , and the Mark-32 mounts still work . Wait  --  screen commander 's sending us a tug , sir . " " Okay , you have the conn . I 'm going below to look at the damage . " You have the conn , Morris thought . How do you conn a ship that ai n't moving ? A minute later he was at a bulkhead , watching men trying to shore it up with lumber . " This one 's fairly solid , sir , the next one forward 's leaking like a damn sieve , no way we 'll patch it all . When the bow let go , it must have twisted everything loose . " The officer grabbed a seaman by the shoulder . " Go to the after D/C locker and get more four-by-fours ! " " Will this one hold ? " " I do n't know . Clarke is checking the bottom out now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffeners . Give me about ten minutes and I 'll tell you if she 'll float or not . " Clarke appeared . He was breathing heavily . " The bulkhead 's sprung at the tank tops , and there 's a small crack , too . Leaking pretty good . The pumps are on , and just about keeping even . I think we can shore it up , but we have to hustle . " The damage-control officer led the welders below at once . Two men appeared with a portable pump . Morris ordered them below . " How many men missing ? " Morris asked Chief Clarke . He was holding his arm strangely . " All the guys made it out of the five-inch mount , but I have n't seen anybody from belowdecks . Shit , I think I broke something myself . " Clarke looked at his right arm and shook his head angrily . " I do n't think many guys made it outa the bow , sir . The watertight doors are twisted some , they got ta he jammed tight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered . " Oh , fuck the arm , skipper ! You need me . " The man was right . Morris went hack topside with Clarke behind him .  | On reaching the bridge , Morris dialed up engineering . The noise on the phone answered his first question . The engineer spoke over the hiss of escaping steam . " Shock damage , Captain . We got some ruptured steam pipes on the number one boiler . I think number two will still work , but I 've popped the safeties on both just in case . The diesel generators are on line . I got some hurt men here . I 'm sending them out . I  --  okay , okay . We just did a check of number two boiler . A few minor leaks , but we can fix ' em quick . Otherwise everything looks pretty tight . I can have it back on line in fifteen minutes . " " We need it . " Morris hung up . Pharris lay dead in the water . With the safety valves opened , steam vented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rasping sound that seemed like the ship 's own cry of pain . The frigate 's sleek clipper bow had been replaced by a flat face of torn metal and hanging wires . The water around the ship was foul with oil from ruptured fuel tanks . For the first time Morris noticed that the ship was down by the stem ; when he stood straight , the ship was misaligned . He knew he had to wait for another damage-control report . As with an accident victim , the prognosis depended on the work of surgeons , and they could not be rushed or disturbed . He lifted the phone to CIC . " Combat , Bridge . What 's the status of that submarine contact ? " " Gallery 's helo dropped on it , but the torp ran dry without hitting anything . Looks like he ran northeast , but we have n't had anything for about five minutes . There 's an Orion in the area now . " " Tell them to check inside of us . This character is n't going to run away unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not out . Tell the screen commander . " " Aye , Cap'n . " He had n't hung the phone up when it buzzed . " Captain speaking . " " She 'll float , sir , " the damage-control officer said at once . " We 're patching the bulkhead now . It wo n't be tight , but the pumps can handle the leakage . Unless something else goes bad on us , we 'll get her home . They sending the tug out to us ? " " Yes . " " If we get a tow , sir , it better be sternfirst . I do n't want to think about trying to run this one into a seaway . " " Right . " Morris looked at Clarke . " Get a gang of men aft . We 'll be taking the tow at the stem , rig it up . Have them launch the whaleboat to look for survivors . I saw at least one man in the water . And get a sling on that arm . " " You got it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C1C and found a working radio .  | " X-Ray Alfa , this is Pharris , " Morris called to the screen commander . " State your condition . " " We took one hit forward , the bow is gone all the way to the ASROC launcher . We can not maneuver . I can keep her afloat unless we hit some bad weather . Both boilers currently down , but we should have power back in less than ten minutes . We have casualties , but I do n't how many or how bad yet . " Commodore , we got hit by a nuke boat , probably a Victor . Unless I miss my guess , he 's headed your way . " " We lost him , but he was heading out , " the Commodore said . " Start looking inside , sir , " Morris urged . " This fellow got to knifefighting range and pulled a beautiful number on us . This one is n't going to run away for long , he 's too damned good for that . " The Commodore thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep that in mind . Gallery 's en route to you . What other assistance do you need ? " " You need Gallery more than we do . Just send us the tug , " Morris answered . He knew that the submarine would n't be coming back to finish the kill . He 'd accomplished that part of his mission . Next , he 'd try to kill some merchants . " Roger that . Let me know if you need anything else . Good luck , Ed . " " Thank you , sir . Out . " Morris ordered his helo to drop a double ring of sonobuoys around his ship just in case . Then the Sea Sprite found three men in the water , one of them dead . The whaleboat recovered them , allowing the helo to rejoin the convoy . It was assigned to Gallery , which took Pharris 's station as the convoy angled south . Below , welders worked their gear in waist-deep saltwater as they struggled to seal off the breaks in the frigate 's watertight bulkheads . The task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the flooded compartments . Before they had finished , the fleet tug Papago pulled alongside the frigate 's square stern . Chief Clarke supervised as a stout towing wire was passed across and secured . An hour later , the tug was pulling the frigate on an easterly course at four knots , backwards to protect the damaged bow . Morris ordered his towed-array sonar to be strung over the bow , trailing it out behind to give them some small defense capability . Several extra lookouts were posted to watch for periscopes . It would be a slow , dangerous trip back home .  | STENDAL , GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC " Be careful , Pasha . " " As always , Comrade General . " Alekseyev smiled . " Come , Captain . " Sergetov fell in behind his superior . Unlike during their previous front-line outing , both men wore protective body armor . The General carried only a sidearm to go along with his map case , but the captain was now officially a bodyguard in addition to a staff officer and had a small Czech submachine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man today , the captain saw . On Alekseyev 's first trip to the front , he 'd been tentative , almost hesitant in manner  --  it had n't occurred to the younger man that , as senior as Alekseyev was , he had never seen combat before and had approached this gravest of contests with the same sort of apprehension as a new private . No longer . He had smelled the smoke . Now he knew how things worked or did n't work . The change was remarkable . His father was right , Sergetov thought , he was a man to be reckoned with . They were joined in their helicopter by an Air Force colonel . The Mi-24 lifted off in darkness , its fighter escort overhead . LAMMERSDORF , FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY Not many people appreciated the importance of the videocassette recorder . A useful convenience for the home , to be sure , but not until a captain in the Royal Dutch Air Force had demonstrated a bright idea two years before had its battlefield utility been proven in secret exercises first in Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radar surveillance aircraft kept their customary positions high over the Rhein . The E-3A Sentry aircraft , better known as AWACS , and the smaller , lesser-known TR-1 , flew their missions in boring circles or straight lines far behind the fighting front . They had similar but different functions . The AWACS was mainly concerned with air traffic . The TR-1 , an upgraded version of the venerable U-2 , looked for vehicles on the ground . Initially the TR-1 had been something of a failure . Because it tracked too many targets , many of them immobile radar reflectors set everywhere by the Soviets , the NATO commanders had been deluged with information that was too disordered to use . Then came the VCR . All the data relayed from the aircraft was recorded on videotape anyway since it was a convenient medium for data storage , but the VCRs built into the NATO system possessed only a few operating features . The Dutch captain thought to bring his personal machine into his office , and demonstrated how by using fast forward and fast reverse , the radar data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going , but also where they had come from . Computer support made the task easier by eliminating items that moved no more than once every two hours  --  thus erasing the Russian radar lures  --  and there it was , a brand-new intelligence tool . With several copies made of each tape , a staff of over a hundred intelligence and traffic-control experts examined the data round the clock . Some engaged in straight tactical intelligence . Others looked for patterns . A large number of trucks moving at night to and from front-line units could only mean shuttle runs to fuel and ammunition dumps . A number of vehicles breaking away from a divisional convoy and deploying in line parallel to the front meant artillery preparing for an attack . The real trick , they had learned , was to get the data to the forward commanders quickly enough so they could make use of it . At Lammersdorf , a Belgian lieutenant was just finishing up a tape that was six hours old , and his report was sent by land line to the forward NATO commanders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Autobahn-7 , he reported . The Soviets would attack at Bad Salzdetfurth in strength , sooner than expected . Immediately , reserve units from the Belgian , German , and American armies were rushed forward , and allied air units alerted for a major land action . Fighting in this sector had been vicious enough already . The German forces covering the area south of Hannover were at less than 50-percent strength , and the battle that had not yet begun was already a race , as both sides tried to get reserves to the point of attack before the other .  | HOLLE , FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY " Thirty minutes , " Alekseyev told Sergetov . Four motor-rifle divisions were on line , covering a front of less than twenty kilometers . Behind them a tank division waited to exploit the first breach in German lines . The objective was the town of Alfeld on the Leine River . The town commanded two roads being used by NATO to shuttle units and supplies north and south , and its capture would open a breach in the NATO lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rear . " Comrade General , how are things progressing in your opinion ? " the captain asked quietly . " Ask me in a few hours , " the General answered . The river valley to his rear was yet another wasteland of men and arms . They were only thirty kilometers from the border  --  and the Red Army 's tanks had been expected to reach Holle in only two days . Alekseyev frowned , wondering what staff genius had come up with that timetable . Again the human factor had been overlooked . The morale and fighting spirit of the Germans was like nothing he had ever seen . He remembered his father 's stories of the battles across the Ukraine and Poland , but he had never quite believed them . He believed them now . The Germans contested every lump of dirt in their country like wolves defending their cubs , retreating only when they were forced to , counterattacking at every opportunity , draining the blood from the advancing Russian units as they brought every weapon they had to bear . Soviet doctrine had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieved only by costly frontal assault which first had to blast a hole in the front lines  --  but the NATO armies were denying that hole to the Soviets . Their sophisticated weapons , firing from safe , prepared positions , were ripping through each attack wave . Their aircraft attacks in the Soviet rear sapped the strength of units before they could be committed to decisive battle and played hob with artillery support despite the most careful deceptive measures . The Red Army was moving forward , Alekseyev reminded himself , and NATO was paying its own price . Their reserves were also being thinned out . The German forces were not using their mobility as Alekseyev would have , too often tying themselves to geographic locations instead of fighting the Soviet forces on the move . Of course , the General thought , they did n't have very much terrain to trade for time . He checked his watch . A sheet of flame rose from the forests below him as Russian artillery began its preparatory bombardment . Next came the multiple-rocket launchers , and the morning sky was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downrange . In a few seconds he saw the orange-white explosions of the rounds as they impacted on NATO lines . Ile was too far  | from the fighting front to see any detail , but an area that had to be many kilometers across , lit up like the neon signs so popular in the West . There was a roar overhead , and the General saw the leading elements of the groundattack fighters racing to the front . " Thank you , Comrade General , " Alekseyev breathed . He counted at least thirty Sukhoi and MiG fighter-bombers , all hugging the ground as they headed toward the battle line . His face crinkled into a determined smile as he walked into the command bunker . " The lead elements are moving now , " a colonel announced . On a table made of rough planks laid across sawhorses , grease pencil marks were made on the tactical maps . Red arrows began their march toward a series of blue lines . The plotters were all lieutenants , and each wore a telephone headset linked to a specific regimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the table , puffing on their cigarettes as they watched the march of the arrows . Behind them the commander of 8th Guards Army stood quietly , watching his plan of attack unfold . " Meeting moderate resistance . Enemy artillery and tank fire is being encountered , " a lieutenant said . Explosions rocked the command bunker . Two kilometers away , a flight of German Phantoms had just torn into a battalion of mobile guns . " Enemy fighters overhead , " the air defense officer said belatedly . A few eyes looked apprehensively up at the log ceiling of the bunker . Alekseyev 's did n't join them . A NATO smart-bomb would kill them all in a blink . Much as he enjoyed his post as deputy commander of the theater , he wished himself back to the days when he had commanded a fighting division . Here he was only an observer , and he felt the need to have the reins in his own two hands . " Artillery reports heavy counterbattery fire and air attacks . Our missiles are engaging enemy aircraft in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air defense officer went on . " Heavy air activity over the front . " " Our fighters are engaging NATO aircraft , " the Frontal Aviation officer reported . He looked up angrily . " Friendly SAMs are shooting down our fighters ! " " Air Defense Officer ! " Alekseyev shouted . " Tell your units to identify their targets ! " " We have fifty aircraft over the front . We can handle the NATO fighters alone ! " the aviator insisted . " Tell all SAM batteries to hold fire on all targets above one thousand meters , " Alekseyev ordered . He had discussed this with his Frontal Aviation commander the night before . The MiG pilots were to stay high after making their own attack runs , leaving the missile and gun batteries free to engage only those NATO aircraft that were an immediate threat to ground units . Why were his own planes getting hit ?  | Thirty thousand feet over the Rhein , two NATO E-3A radar aircraft fought for their lives . A determined Soviet attack was under way , two regiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The on-board controllers were calling for help . This both distracted them from countering the attack , and stripped fighters from other missions . Heedless of their own safety , the Russians came west at over a thousand miles per hour with heavy jamming support . American F-15 Eagles and French Mirage jets converged on the threat , filling the sky with missiles . It was not enough . When the MiGs got to within sixty miles , the AWACS aircraft shut down their radars and dove for the ground to evade the attack . The NATO fighters over Bad Salzdetfurth were on their own . For the first time the Soviets had achieved air superiority over a major battlefield . " Hundred-forty-third Guards Rifle Regiment reports they have broken through German lines , " a lieutenant said . He did n't look up , but extended the arrow for which he was responsible . " Enemy units retreating in disarray . " " Hundred-forty-fifth Guards checking in , " reported the plotting officer next to him . " The first line of German resistance has collapsed . Proceeding south along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units are on the run . They are not regrouping , not attempting to turn . " The general commanding 8th Guards Army gave Alekseyev a triumphant look . " Get that tank division moving ! " The two understrength German brigades covering this sector had suffered too much , been called upon to stop too many attacks . Their men spent , their weapons depleted , they had no choice but to run from the enemy , hoping to form a new line in the woods behind Highway 243 . At Hackenstedt , four kilometers away , 20th Guards Tank Division started moving down the road . Its three hundred T-80 main battle tanks , supported by several hundred more infantry assault carriers , spread left and right of the secondary road and formed its attack formation in columns of regiments . The 20th Tanks was the operation/maneuver group for 8th Guards Army . Since the war had begun , the Soviet Army had been trying to break one of these powerful units into the NATO rear . It was now possible . " Well done , Comrade General , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakthrough . Three of the four attacking motor-rifle divisions had broken through the German lines . The MiGs succeeded in killing one of the AWACS aircraft and three Eagle fighters , at the price of nineteen of their own , in a furious air battle that lasted fifteen minutes . The surviving AWACS was hack at altitude now , eighty miles behind the Rhein , and its radar operators were working to  | reestablish control of the air battle over central Germany as the MiGs ran for home through a cloud of NATO surface-to-air missiles . At murderous cost they had accomplished a mission for which they had not even been briefed . But this was only the beginning . Now that the initial attack had succeeded , the most difficult part of the battle was under way . The generals and colonels commanding the attack had to move their units forward rapidly , careful to keep the formations intact as they leapfrogged their artillery southwest to provide continuous support for the advancing regiments . The tank division had the highest priority . It had to hit the next set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to reach Alfeld before nightfall . Units of the field police established pre-planned traffic-control points , and directed units down roads whose marker signs had been removed by the Germans  --  of course . The process was not as easy as might have been expected . Units were not intact . Some commanders were dead , vehicles had broken down , and damaged roads slowed traffic well below normal rates of advance . For their part the German troops were trying to reorganize . Rear-guard units lingered behind every turn in the road , pausing to loose their antitank missiles at the hard-charging Soviet advance guard , which took a particularly heavy toll of unit commanders . Allied aircraft were reorganizing also , and low-level attack fighters began to engage the Soviet units in the open . Behind the sundered battle line a German tank brigade rolled into Alfeld , with a Belgian motorized regiment ten minutes behind . The Germans proceeded northeast on the main road , watched by citizens who had just been ordered to evacuate their homes . FASLANE , SCOTLAND " No luck , eh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " None , " McCafferty confirmed . Even the trip into Faslane had been unlucky . The guard ship for the safe-transit corridor , HMS Osiris , had gotten into attack position without their having detected her . Had that Brit diesel sub been a Russian , McCafferty could very well be dead now . " We had our big chance against that amphibious group . Things were going perfect , y'know ? The Russians had their sonobuoy lines out , and we beat them clean , just about had our targets lined up for the missile attack  --  I figured we 'd hit with our missiles first , then go in with torpedoes ? " " Sounds good to me , " Simms agreed . " And somebody else launches his own torpedo attack . Screwed everything up . We lofted three Harpoons , but a helo saw us do it , and , bingo ! we had the bastards all over us . " McCafferty pulled open the door to the Officers Club . " I need a drink ! " " Hrll , yes ! " Simms laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Hey , that sort of thing happens . Luck changes , Danny . " Simms leaned over the bar . " Two strong ones . " " As you say , Commander . " A white-coated steward drew two mugs of warm , dark beer . Simms picked up the bill and led his friend to a corner booth . There was some sort of small party going on at the far end of the room . " Danny , for crying out loud , let up on yourself . Not your fault that Ivan did n't send you any targets , is it ? " McCafferty took a long pull on his mug . Two miles away Chicago was reprovisioning . They 'd be in port for two days . Boston and another 688-class sub were tied to the same quay , with another pair due in later today . They were to be outfitted for a special mission , but they did n't yet know what it was . In the meantime , the officers and crewmen were using their modicum of free time to breathe fresh air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right as ever . " " Good . Have some pretzels . Looks like quite a shindig over there . How about we wander over ? " Simms lifted his beer and walked to the end of the room . They found a gathering of submarine officers , which was not a surprise , but the center of attention was . He was a Norwegian captain , a blond man of about thirty who clearly had n't been sober for several hours . As soon as he drained one jar of beer , a Royal Navy commander handed him another . " I must find the man who save us ! " the Norwegian insisted loudly and drunkenly . " What gives ? " Simms asked . Introductions were exchanged . The Royal Navy officer was captain of HMS Oberon . " This is the chappie who blasted Kirov all the way back to Murmansk , " he said . " He tells the story about every ten minutes . About time for him to begin again . " " Son of a bitch , " McCafferty said . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Norwegian began speaking again . " We make our approach slowly . They come right " ? he belched ? " to us , and we creep very slow . I put periscope up , and there he is ! Four thousand meters , twenty knots , he will pass within five hundred meters starboard . " The beer mug swept toward the floor . " Down periscope ! Arne  --  where are you , Arne ? Oh , is drunk at table . Arne is weapons officer . He set to fire four torpedoes . Type thirty-seven , American torpedoes . " He gestured at the two American officers who had just joined the crowd . Four Mark-37s ! McCafferty winced at the thought . That could ruin your whole day . " Kirov is very close now . Up periscope ! Course same , speed same , distance now two thousand meters  --  I shoot ! One ! Two ! Three ! Four ! Reload and dive deep . "  | " You 're the guy who ruined my approach ! " McCafferty shouted . The Norwegian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ' ? " " Dan McCafferty , USS Chicago . " " You were there ? " " Yes . " " You shoot missiles ? " " Yes . " " Hero ! " The Norwegian submarine commander ran to McCafferty , almost knocking him down as he wrapped the American in a crushing bear hug . " You save my men ! You save my ship ! " " What the hell is this ? " Simms asked . " Oh , introductions , " said a Royal Navy captain . " Captain Bjorn Johannsen of His Norwegian Majesty 's submarine Kobben . Captain Daniel McCafferty of USS Chicago . " " After we shoot Kirov , they come around us like wolves . Kirov blow up " Four fish ? I believe it , " Simms agreed . " Russians come to us with cruiser , two destroyers , " Johannsen continued , now quite sober . " We , ah , evade , go deep , but they find us and fire their RBU rockets  --  many , many rockets . Most far , some close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You hit her ? " " One hit , hurt but not sink . This take , I am not sure , ten minutes , fifteen . It was very busy time , yes ? " " Me , too . We came in fast , flipped on the radar . There were three ships where we thought Kirov was . " " Kirov was sunk  --  blow up ! What you see was cruiser and two destroyers . Then you shoot missiles , yes ? " Johannsen 's eyes sparkled . " Three Harpoons . A Helix saw the launch and came after us . We evaded , never did know if the missiles hit anything . " " Hit ? Hah ! Let me tell you . " Johannsen gestured . " We dead , battery down . We have damage now , can not run . We already evade four torpedoes , but they have us now . Sonar have us . Destroyer fire RBU at us . First three miss , but they have us . Then  --  Boom ! Boom ! Boom ! Many more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink , I think . " We escape . " Johannsen hugged McCafferty again , and both spilled their beer on the floor . The American had never seen a Norwegian display this much emotion , even around his wife . " My crew alive because of you , Chicago ! I buy you drink . I buy all your men drink . " " You are sure we killed that tin can ? " " You not kill , " Johannsen said . " My ship dead , my men dead , I dead . You kill . " A destroyer was n't exactly as good as sinking a nuclear-powered battle cruiser , McCafferty told himself , but it was a whole lot better than  | nothing , too . And a piece of another , he reminded himself . And who knows , maybe that one sank on the way home . " Not too shabby , Dan , " Simms observed . " Some people , " said the skipper of HMS Oberon , " have all the bloody luck ! " " You know , Todd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is pretty good beer . " USS PHARRIS There were only two bodies to bury . Another fourteen men were missing and presumed dead , but for all that , Morris counted himself fortunate . Twenty sailors were injured to one extent or another . Clarke 's broken forearm , a number of broken ankles from the shock of the torpedo impact , and a halfdozen bad scaldings from ruptured steam pipes . That did n't count minor cuts from flying glass . Morris read through the ceremony in the manual , his voice emotionless as he went through the words about the sure and certain hope of how the sea will one day give up her dead . . . On command the seamen tilted up the mess tables . The bodies wrapped in plastic bags and weighted with steel slid out from under the flags , dropping straight into the water . It was ten thousand feet deep here , a long last trip for his executive officer and a third-class gunner 's mate from Detroit . The rifle salute followed , but not taps . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tape recorder was broken . Morris closed the book . " Secure and carry on . " The flags were folded properly and taken to the sail locker . The mess tables were carried below and the stanchions were replaced to support the lifelines . And USS Pharris was still only half a ship , fit only to broken up for scrap , Morris knew . The tug Papago was pulling her backwards at just more than four knots . Three days to shore . They were heading toward Boston , the closest port , rather than a naval base . The reason was clear enough . Repairs would take over a year and the Navy did n't want to clutter up one of its own repair facilities with something that would take that long . Only those ships that could be repaired for useful war service would get rapid attention . Even his continued command of Pharris was a joke . The tug had a reserve crew , many of them salvage experts in civilian life . Three of them were aboard to keep an eye on the towing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to do . Their pieces of advice were really orders , but polite ones . There were plenty of things to keep his crew busy . The forward bulkheads required constant watching and attention . Repairs were under way  | to the engine plant . Only one boiler was working , providing steam to turn the turbogenerators and provide electrical power . The second boiler needed at least another day of work . His main air-search radar , they said , would be working in four hours . The satellite antenna was just back on line also . By the time they reached port  --  if they reached port  --  everything aboard that his crew could fix would be fixed . That did n't really matter , but a busy crew , the Navy has always said , is a happy crew . In practical terms it meant that the crewmen , unlike their captain , did not have time to brood on what mistakes had been made , the lives that had been lost because of them , and who had made them . Morris went to the Combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paper record of the encounter with the Victor , trying to find what had happened . " I do n't know . " The sonar operator shrugged . " Maybe it was two subs , not just one . I mean , here he is , right ? This bright trail here  --  then a couple minutes later the active sonar picked him up over here . " " Only one sub , " Morris said . " Getting from here to there is about a fourminute run at twenty-five knots . " " But we did n't hear him , sir , an ' it do n't show on the screen . Besides , he was heading the other way when we lost him . " The sonarman rewound the tape to run it all again . " Yeah . " Morris went back to the bridge , playing it over again in his mind . He had the entire sequence memorized now . He walked out on the bridge wing . The spray shields were still perforated , and there was a faint bloodstain where the XO had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief Clarke had all kinds of work gangs going . Morris lit a cigarette and stared at the horizon . REYDARVATH , ICELAND The helicopter was the last warning they needed . Edwards and his party were heading northeast . They passed through an area of many small lakes , crossed a gravel road after waiting an hour to see what the traffic there was likenone  --  and began to traverse a series of marshes . By this time Edwards was thoroughly confused by the terrain . The mixture of bare rock , grassy meadows , lava fields , and now a freshwater marsh made him wonder if Iceland might not be the place where God had put everything that had been left over after the world was built . Evidently He 'd made just the right amount of trees , though , because there were none here , and their best cover was the knee-high grass that sprouted from the water . It must be hardy grass , Edwards thought , since this marsh had been frozen not too long ago . It was still cold , and within minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They endured the misery . The alternative was to travel on bare and slightly ele-  | vated ground , not something to be contemplated with enemy helicopters about . Vigdis surprised them with her endurance . She kept up with the Marines without faltering or complaining . A true country girl , Edwards thought , she was still benefiting from a childhood of chasing the family sheep around  --  or whatever it was you did with sheep  --  and climbing these Goddamned hills . " Okay , people , take ten , " Edwards called . Immediately everyone looked for a dry spot to collapse . Mainly they found rocks . Rocks in a marsh ! Edwards thought . Garcia kept watch with the purloined Russian binoculars . Smith lit up a cigarette . Edwards turned around to see Vigdis sitting down next to him . " How do you feel ? " " Very tired , " she said with a slight smile . " But not so tired as you . " " Is that so ! " Edwards laughed . " Maybe we should step up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're going to Hvammsfjordur . They did n't say why . I figure another four or five days . We want to stay clear of all the roads we can . " " To protect me , yes ? " Edwards shook his head . " To protect all of us . We do n't want to fight anybody . There 's too many Russians around to play soldier games . " " So , I do n't hurt  --  ah , stop you from important things ? " Vigdis asked . " Not at all . We 're all happy to have you with us . Who would n't like a walk in the country with a beautiful girl ? " Edwards asked gallantly . Was that a smart thing to say ? She gave him a strange look . " You think I pretty , after  --  after ? " " Vigdis , if you were hit by a truck  --  yes , you are very beautiful . No man could change that . What happened to you was not your fault . Whatever changes it made are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you . " My baby , you mean ? Mistake . He find another girl . This is not important , all my friends have babies . " She shrugged it off . That stupid son of a bitch , Edwards thought . He remembered that bastardy carried no stigma on Iceland . Since no one had a surname  --  most of the Icelanders had given names followed by patronymics  --  you could n't even tell the difference between the legitimate and illegitimate . Besides which , the Icelanders did n't seem to give a damn one way or the other . Young unmarried girls had babies , took proper care of them , and that was that . But who would walk away from this girl ? " Well , speaking for myself : Vigdis , I 've never met a girl prettier than you . " " Truly ? " Her hair looked like hell , tangled and filthy , Edwards admitted to himself . 1 1cr face and clothing were covered with dust and mud . A hot shower  | could change that in a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty comes from within , and he was only beginning to appreciate the person inside . He ran his hand along her cheek . " Any man who says different is an idiot . " He turned to see Sergeant Smith coming over . " Time to move , ' less you want our legs to stiffen up , Lieutenant . " " Okay . I want to make another eight or ten miles . There 's farms and roads on the far side of this mountain we 're walking around . We 'll want to eyeball that area before we try to cross it . I 'll call in from there , too . " " You got it , skipper . Rodgers ! Take the point and bend it a little west . " BODENBURG , FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY The ride forward had not been an easy one . Eighth Guards Army moved its forward command post as close behind the leading troops as possible . Its commander , like Alekseyev , believed in having his eyes and ears as close to the front as possible . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was far too dangerous to use helicopters  --  during which Alekseyev had observed a pair of savage air attacks on Russian columns . German and Belgian reinforcements had joined the action , and intercepts of radio messages indicated that American and British units were also en route . Alekseyev had called up more Russian units as well . What had begun as a relatively simple push by one mechanized army was now growing into a major engagement . He took this to be a good sign . NATO would not be reinforcing if they did not regard the situation as dangerous . The Soviet task was to achieve the desired result before reinforcements came into play . The general commanding 20th Guards Tank Division was in the command post . They 'd set it up in a secondary school . A new building , it had lots of space , and until an underground bunker could be prepared , it would have to do . The pace of the advance had slowed , as much because of traffic control difficulties as from the Germans . " Straight down this road to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My motor-rifle troops should have it clear by the time you get there . " " Four more kilometers to Alfeld . Yes , just make sure you can support us when we jump across the river . " The General set his helmet atop his head and moved out the door . It was going to work , Alekseyev thought . This general had done a magnificent job of delivering his unit to the front in nearly perfect order . The next thing he heard was an explosion . Windows shattered , pieces of ceiling dropped around him . The Devil 's Cross had returned yet again . Alekseyev raced outside to see a dozen burning armored vehicles . As he watched , the crew hailed out of a brand-new T-80 tank . An instant later the  | vehicle brewed up : a fire swept through the ammunition racks inside and a pillar of flame rose toward the sky as from a small volcano . " The general is dead  --  the general is dead ! " a sergeant shouted . He pointed to a BMD infantry carrier from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commander of the 8th Guards Army cursing beside him . " The assistant commander of that tank division is a new colonel . " Pavel Leonidovich reached a quick and convenient decision . " No , Comrade General . What about me ? " Startled , the commander stared at him , then remembered Alekseyev 's reputation as a tank commander , and his father 's . He made a quick decision of his own . " Twentieth Tanks is yours . You know the mission . " Another infantry assault carrier rolled up . Alekseyev and Sergetov boarded it , and the driver sped off toward the divisional command post . It took half an hour before they stopped . Alekseyev saw rows of tanks parked inside the treeline . Allied artillery was falling close by , but he ignored it . His regimental commanders were grouped together . The General quickly gave orders for objective and timing . It spoke well of the General not dead an hour that everyone here knew his mission . The division was finely organized , with every part of the assault plan already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good battle staff . He set them to work as his unit commanders rejoined their regiments . His first battle headquarters was fittingly in the shade of a tall tree . His father could have wished for no better . Alekseyev smiled . He found his divisional intelligence officer . " What 's the situation ? " " A battalion of German tanks is counterattacking on this road leading east from Sack . They should be contained , and in any case our vehicles are moving southwest behind them . The lead motor-rifle troops are just inside the town , and report only minor resistance . Our leading elements are now moving and should be there within the hour . " " Air Defense Officer ? " " SAMs and mobile antiaircraft guns are just behind the leading echelons . We also have friendly air cover . Two regiments of MiG-21 s are on call for air defense , but we have n't had any ground-attack fighters assigned yet . They took a beating this morning  --  but so did the other side . We killed twelve NATO aircraft before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three , as he had learned . " Excuse me , Comrade General . I am Colonel Popov , your divisional political officer . " " Fine , Comrade Colonel . My Party dues are paid to the end of the year , and with luck I will live to pay them again . If you have something important to say , be quick ! " If there was anything Alekseyev did n't need now , it was a zampolit ! " After we capture Alfeld ? "  | " If we capture Alfeld I will let you have the keys to the city . For the present , let me do my job . Dismissed ! " Probably wanted permission to shoot suspected fascists . As a four-star general , Alekseyev could not ignore political officers , but at least he could ignore those under the rank of general . He walked over to the tactical maps . On one side as before , lieutenants showed the advance of his  --  his ! ? units . On the other , intelligence officers were assembling what data they had on enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I want that lead regiment right behind the motor-rifle troops . If they need some help , give it to them . I want this breakthrough and I want it today . What artillery do we have set up ? " " Two battalions of heavy guns are ready now . " " Good . If those infantry have targets for them , find out , and let 's start hitting them now . This is not a time for finesse . NATO knows we 're here , and our worst enemy is time . Time works for them , not for us . " The operations officer and artillery commander got together , and two minutes later his 152mm guns were delivering fire to the front . He 'd have to have a medal awarded to the dead commander of 20th Tanks , Alekseyev decided ; the man deserved a reward of some kind for the training he saw evident in this staff . " Enemy air attack in progress , " a plotting officer said . " Enemy tanks emerging from woods east of Sack , estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He had to trust his colonels now , Alekseyev knew . The time at which a general could observe the entire battle and control it was long past . His staff officers made their little marks on the map . The Germans should have waited , the General thought , they should have let the division spearhead go through , then attack the division supply column . That was foolish , the first time he had seen a German commander make a tactical error . Probably a junior officer who had relieved a dead or wounded superior , or perhaps a man whose home was nearby . Whatever the reason , it was a mistake and Alekseyev was profiting by it . His leading two tank regiments took losses , but they smashed the German counterattack in ten furious minutes . " Two kilometers  --  leading elements now two kilometers from Sack . Opposition from artillery only . Friendly units are in sight . Infantry troops in Sack report minor resistance only . The town is nearly clear . Forward scouts report the road to Alfeld is open ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objective is Alfeld on the Leine. "  | ALFELD , FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY It was a scratch team . American mechanized infantrymen and the lead tank squadron of an advancing British brigade reinforced the remains of Germans and Belgians who had been crushed by five Soviet divisions that day . There was little time . Combat engineers worked furiously with their armored bulldozers to scrape shelters for the tanks while infantrymen dug holes for their antitank weapons . A cloud of dust on the horizon was all the warning they needed . A division of tanks was reported heading their way , and the civilians had not entirely evacuated the town behind them . Twenty miles behind them , a squadron of ground-attack aircraft circled , waiting for the call-down signal . " Enemy in sight ! " a lookout on a church steeple radioed . In seconds , artillery fire lashed at the leading Soviet columns . Antitank-missile crews popped the covers off their targeting scopes and loaded the first weapons of what promised to be a long afternoon . The Challenger tanks of 3rd Royal Tank Regiment settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zeroed their sights on distant targets . Things were too confused , and there had not been enough time to establish a firm chain of command here . An American was first to fire . The TOW-2 missile sped downrange , its control wires trailing out behind like a spider 's web as it reached four kilometers to a T-80 tank .. . " Advanced elements are now under fire from enemy missile teams , " reported a plotting officer . " Flatten them ! " Alekseyev ordered his artillery commander . Within a minute the division 's multiple-rocket launchers were filling the sky with trails of fire . Tube artillery fire added to the carnage at the battle line . Then NATO artillery joined the fray in earnest . " Lead regiment is taking losses . " Alekseyev watched the map in silence . There was no room for deceptive maneuver here , nor was there time . His men had to race through the enemy lines as quickly as possible in order to seize the bridges on the Leine . That meant that his leading tank crews would suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the price had to be paid . Twelve Belgian F-16 fighters swept in low over the front at five hundred knots , dropping tons of cluster munitions on the lead Soviet regiment , killing nearly thirty tanks and a score of infantry carriers less than a kilometer from the allied lines . A swarm of missiles rose into the sky after them , and the single-engine fighters turned west , skimming over the ground in their attempt  | to evade . Three were smashed to the ground , and fell among the NATO troops , adding to the carnage already created by Soviet fire . The commander of the British tanks saw that he lacked the firepower to stop the Soviet attack . There just was n't enough . It was time to leave while his battalion was still able to fight . He alerted his companies to be ready to pull out and tried to get the word to neighboring units . But the troops around Alfeld came from four different armies , with separate languages and radio settings . There had n't been time to establish exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to leave . The town had not yet been fully evacuated , and the German troops would not desert their positions until their countrymen were safely across the river . The Americans and Belgians began to move when the British colonel told them to , but not the Germans , and the result was chaos within the NATO lines . " Forward observers report enemy units moving back on the right , repeat , enemy units appear to be disengaging on the northern side of the town . " " Move the second regiment north , loop around and head for the bridges , fast as they can . Disregard losses and charge for those damned bridges ! Operations Officer , keep pressure on all enemy units . We want to trap them on this side and finish them if we can , " Alekseyev ordered . " Sergetov , come with me . I have to go forward . " The attack had ripped the heart out of his lead regiment , Alekseyev knew , but it had been worth the cost . The NATO forces would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridges , and having the allied units on the north side disengage first was a godsend . Now with a fresh regiment he 'd be able to run over them and , if he were very lucky , get the bridges intact . This he 'd have to supervise himself . Alekseyev and Sergetov boarded a tracked vehicle , which motored southeast to catch the maneuvering regiment . Behind them his operations officer began to give new orders over the divisional radio net . Five kilometers on the far side of the river , a battery of German 155mm guns was waiting for this opportunity . They had remained silent , waiting for their radio-intercept experts to pin down the divisional headquarters . Quickly the gunners punched the target data into their fire-control computers while others loaded high-explosive shells . Every gun in the battery trained out on an identical azimuth . The ground shook when they began rapid fire . A hundred shells fell in and around the divisional headquarters in less than two minutes . Half the battle staff was killed outright , most of the others wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close brush with death . That was my fault . I should have checked the siting of the radio transmitters . I must not make that mistake again . . . Damn ! Damn ! Damn !  | Alfeld 's streets were clogged with civilian vehicles . The Americans in their Bradley tracked vehicles avoided the town entirely , hurrying down the right bank of the Leine and crossing to the other side in good order . There , they took positions on the hills overlooking Leine , and set up to cover the crossing of the other allied troops . The Belgians were next . Only a third of their tanks had survived , and these covered the southern flank on the far side of the river , hoping to stop the Russians before they were able to cross . German Staatspolizei had held back civilian traffic and allowed the armored units to pass , but this changed when Soviet artillery began bursting in the air close to the river . The Russians had hoped it would impede traffic , and it did . Civilians who had been late to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error . The artillery did scant damage to fighting vehicles but thoroughly wrecked civilian cars and trucks . In minutes , the streets of Alfeld were jammed with disabled and burning cars . People left them , braving the fire to run for the bridges , and the tanks trying to make their way to the river found their way blocked . Their only escape was over the bodies of innocent civilians , and even when ordered to proceed , the drivers shrank from it . Gunners rotated their turrets to face over the rear and began to engage the Russian tanks now entering the town . Smoke from burning buildings wafted across everyone 's field of view . Cannon fired at targets glimpsed for a moment , rounds went wild , and the streets of Alfeld turned into a slaughterhouse of soldiers and noncombatants . " There they are ! " Sergetov pointed . Three highway bridges spanned the Leine . Alekseyev started to give orders , but they were n't necessary . The regimental commander already had his radio microphone keyed , and directed a battalion of tanks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same route , still relatively open , that the Americans had used . The American fighting vehicles on the far side of the river opened fire with missiles and their light cannon , killing a half-dozen tanks , and the remainder of the regiment engaged them with direct fire while Alekseyev personally called down artillery on the hilltops . In Alfeld the battle had come to a bloody standstill . The German and British tanks took up positions at intersections largely hidden from view by wrecked cars and trucks , and backed toward the river slowly as they fought to give the civilians time . The Russian infantry tried to engage them with missiles , but too often debris lying in the streets tore the flight-control wires , causing the missiles to fall out of control and explode harmlessly . Russian and allied artillery fire churned the town to rubble . Alekseyev watched his troops advancing toward the first bridge .  | South of him , the commander of the lead regiment swore at his losses . More than half his tanks and assault vehicles had been destroyed . Victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been stopped again by impassable streets and murderous fire . He saw the NATO tanks pulling slowly back , and , enraged that they were escaping , called in for artillery . Alekseyev was surprised when the artillery fire shifted from the center of the town to the riverfront . He was shocked when he realized that it was not tube artillery fire , but rockets . As he watched , explosions appeared at random over the riverfront . Then rounds began exploding in the river in rapid succession . The rate of fire increased as more and more launchers were trained on the target , and it was already too late for him to stop them . The farthest bridge went first . Three rockets landed at once , and it came apart . Alekseyev watched in horror as over a hundred civilians fell into the churning water . His horror was not for the loss of life  --  he needed that bridge ! Two more rockets landed on the center bridge . It did not collapse , but the damage it took was serious enough to prevent tanks from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? He turned to Sergetov . " Call up the engineers . Get bridging units and assault boats to the front . They have absolute priority . Next , I want every surface-to-air missile and antiair gun battery you can find . Anyone who gets in their way will be shot . Make sure the traffic-control officers know this . Go ! " The Soviet tanks and infantry had reached the only surviving bridge . Three infantry vehicles raced to the far side and were taken under fire by the Belgians and Americans as they raced to cover . A tank followed . The T-80 rumbled across , got to the far side and exploded from an impacting missile . Another followed , then a third . Both reached the west bank . Then a British Chieftain emerged from behind a building and followed the Soviet tanks across . Alekseyev watched in amazement as it ran right between the two Soviet vehicles , neither of which saw it . An American missile ran just behind it and plowed into the ground , raising a cloud of dirt and dust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a point-blank shot by a T-80 , the other fired back , killing the Russian tank a second later . Alekseyev remembered a tale from his boyhood of a brave peasant on a bridge as the British tank engaged and killed two more Soviet tanks before succumbing to a barrage of direct fire . Five more Soviet vehicles raced across the bridge . The General lifted his headset and dialed up 8th Guards Army Headquarters . " ' Phis is Alekseyev . I have a company of troops across the Leine . I need support . We have broken through . Repeat : we have broken through the  | German front ! I want air support and helicopters to engage NATO units north and south of Bridge 439 . I need two regiments of infantry to assist with the river crossing . Get me support and I might have my division across by midnight . " " You 'll get everything I have . My bridging units are on the way . " Alekseyev leaned against the side of his BMP . He unbuckled his canteen and took a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . Two complete companies were across now . Allied fire was now attempting to destroy the remaining bridge . He had to get at least a full battalion across if he wanted to hold this bridgehead for more than a few hours . " I 'll get the bastard , " he promised himself , " who fired on my bridges . " " Boats and bridges are en route , Comrade General , " Sergetov reported . " They have first priority , and the sector traffic-control officers have been informed . Two SAM batteries are starting this way , and I found three mobile AA guns three kilometers off . They said they can be here in fifteen minutes . " " Good . " Alekseyev trained his binoculars on the far bank . " Comrade General , our infantry carriers are amphibious . Why do n't we swim them across ? " " Look at the riverbank , Vanya . " The General handed his glasses over . As far as he could see , the far side was all set with stone and concrete to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tracked vehicles to climb that . Damn the Germans for that ! " Besides , I would n't want to try that in anything less than regimental strength . That bridge is all we have , and it ca n't last very long . With the best of luck we wo n't have any assault bridges in place for several hours . The troops on the far side are on their own for at least that long . We 'll run as many troops and vehicles across the bridge as we can , then reinforce with infantry assault boats as soon as they arrive . The book calls for this sort of crossing to be made in assault boats , under cover of darkness or smoke . I do n't want to wait for night , and I need the guns to fire live shells , not harmless ones . We must break the rules , Vanya . Fortunately the book allows for that also . You have performed well , Ivan Mikhailovich . You are now a major . Do n't thank me  --  you 've earned it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em by much . If we 'd seen them five minutes sooner , we could have taken a few out . As it was ? " The Tomcat pilot shrugged . Toland nodded . The fighters had orders to remain outside Soviet radar coverage . " You know , it 's a funny thing . There were three of them flying a nice tight formation . I had them on my TV system from fifty miles away . No way in hell they could tell we were there . If we had better range , we could follow them all the way home . Like that game the Germans played on us once upon  | a time  --  send a bird right behind a returning raid and drop a few bombs right after they landed . " " We 'd never get anything through their IFF , " Toland replied . " True , but we 'd know their arrival time at their bases to within , oh , ten minutes . That 's got ta be useful to somebody . " Commander Toland set his cup down . " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put that idea on the printer to Commander , Eastern Atlantic . LAMMERSDORF , FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY There was no mistaking it . NATO lines had been decisively broken south of Hannover . Two brigades were taken from the perilously thin NATO ground reserve and sent toward Alfeld . Unless this hole was plugged , Hannover would be lost , and with it all of Germany east of the Weser.  | ALFELD , FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY As predicted , the bridge lasted less than an hour . In that time Alekseyev had gotten a full battalion of mechanized infantry across , and though the NATO troops launched a pair of vicious counterattacks on his bridgehead , the tanks he 'd placed on the east bank had been able to break them up with direct fire . Now NATO had caught its breath , and was assembling artillery . Heavy guns pounded his bridgehead and the tanks on the Soviet side of the river , and to make matters worse , the assault boats had been held up by incredible traffic snarls on the road between Sack and Alfeld . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with artillery-deployed mines , each powerful enough to knock the tread off a tank or the wheel off a truck . Sappers swept the roads continuously , using heavy machine guns to detonate the mines , but every one took time , and not all were seen before they exploded under a heavily loaded vehicle . The loss of the individual trucks and tanks was bad enough ; worse still were the traffic tieups that resulted from each disabled vehicle . Alekseyev 's headquarters were in a camera shop overlooking the river . The plate-glass window had long since been blown away , and his boots crackled with every step . He surveyed the far bank through his binoculars and anguished for his men as they tried to fight back at the men and tanks on the hills above them . A few kilometers away , every mobile gun in 8th Guards Army was racing forward to provide fire support for his tank division , and he and Sergetov set them to counterbattery the NATO guns . " Enemy aircraft ! " a lieutenant shouted .  | Alekseyev craned his neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly into a German F-104 fighter . Yellow tracer lines reached out from his AA guns and blotted it from the sky before it could release , but instantly another appeared , this one firing its own cannon at the gun vehicle and exploding it . Alekseyev swore as the single-engine fighter bored in , dropped two bombs on the far side of the river , and streaked away . The bombs fell slowly , retarded by small parachutes , then , twenty meters over the ground , appeared to fill the air with fog Alekseyev dove to the floor of the shop as the cloud of explosive vapor detonated from the fuel-air-explosive bombs . The shock wave was fearful , and above his head a display case shattered , dropping broken glass all over him . " What the hell was that ? " Sergetov yelled , deafened by the blast , then , looking up , " You 're hit , Comrade General ! " Alekseyev ran his hand over his face . It came away red . His eyes stung , and he poured the contents of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Major Sergetov slapped a bandage on his general 's forehead with only one hand , Alekseyev noticed . " What happened to you ? " " I fell on some of this damned glass ! Stay still , Comrade General , you 're bleeding like a slaughtered cow . " A lieutenant general showed up . Alekseyev recognized him as Viktor Beregovoy , 8th Guards Army 's second in command . " Comrade General , you have orders to return to headquarters . I am here to relieve you . " " The hell you say ! " Alekseyev bellowed . " The orders come from Commander-in-Chief West , Comrade . I am a general of tank troops . I can carry on here . If you will permit me to say so , you have performed brilliantly . But you are needed elsewhere . " " Not until I 'm finished ! " " Comrade General , if you want this crossing to succeed , we need more support here . Who can better arrange that support , you or I ? " Beregovoy asked reasonably . Alekseyev let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but for the first time Pavel Leonidovich Alekseyev had led  --  really led ! ? men in combat , and he had done well . Alekseyev knew it  --  he had done well ! " There is no time to argue . You have your task and I have mine , " the man said . " You know the situation ? " " Fully . There is a vehicle in the back to return you to headquarters . " Alekseyev held the bandage to his head  --  Sergetov had n't tied it properly and walked out the back of the shop . Where the door had once been , he found a gaping hole . A HMI ) infantry carrier was there , its motor running . Alekseyev got in and found a medical orderly who clucked over the General  | and went immediately to work . As the carrier pulled off , Alekseyev listened to the noise of combat diminish . It was the saddest sound he had ever heard . LANGLEY AIR FORCE BASE , VIRGINIA There was nothing like a Distinguished Flying Cross to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be the first female Air Force pilot to have one . If not , Major Nakamura decided , what the hell ? She had a gun-camera videotape of all three of her Badgers , and a Navy pilot she 'd met in Brittany before catching a flight Stateside had called her one damned fine pilot , for an Air Force puke . After which she had reminded him that if the dumbass Navy pilots had listened to her , maybe their air base would n't be in a body and fender shop . Game , set , and match , she grinned , to Major Amelia Nakamura , USAF . All the F-15s that could be ferried across the Atlantic had been ferried , and now she had another job . Only four of the 48th Fighter Interceptor Squadron 's Eagles were still at Langley . The rest were scattered up and down the East Coast , including the two pilots who were qualified for the ASAT antisatellite missiles , As soon as she 'd heard that , she had made a phone call and informed Space Command that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight profile , and why take a combat pilot off the line when she could handle the mission very well , thank you . She checked to make sure the ugly missile was properly attached to the airframe . It had been taken out of secure storage and reexamined by a team of experts . Buns shook her head . There had only been one real test of the system before a moratorium had been slapped on the project . A successful test , to be sure , but only one . She hoped it would work . The Navy really needed help from the Air Force pukes . Besides , that A-6 driver was cute . The major finished her walkaround , taking her time  --  her target was n't over the Indian Ocean yet  --  then strapped herself into her Eagle , ran her eyes and hands over the gauges and handles , adjusted the seat , and finally input the numbers painted on the wall of the aircraft shelter into the aircraft 's inertial navigation system so that the fighter would know where it was . Finished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helmet protected her from the shriek of the two Pratt and Whitney engines . The needles on her engine gauges rotated into proper position . Below her , the crew chief gave the aircraft a careful examination , then waved to her to taxi the aircraft into the open . Six people were out there , standing behind the red warning line to protect their ears from the noise . Always nice to have an audience , she thought , ignoring them . " Eagle One-Zero-Four ready to taxi , " she told the tower . " One-Zero-Four , roger . You are cleared to taxi , " the tower controller replied . " Wind is two-five-three at twelve knots . "  | " Roger that , One-Zero-Four is rolling . " Buns brought her canopy down . The crew chief snapped to attention and gave the major a perfect salute . Nakamura answered it with panache , advanced her throttles slightly , and the Eagle fighter moved off to the runway like a crippled stork . A minute later , she was in the air , a silky smooth feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the sky . Kosmos 1801 was just completing its southbound leg , bending around the Straits of Magellan to head north over the Atlantic . The orbital pass would take it two hundred miles off the American coast . At the ground-control station , technicians prepared to switch on the powerful sea-surveillance radar . They were sure an American carrier battle group was at sea , but had been unable to locate it . Three regiments of Backfires were waiting for information that would allow them to repeat the feat accomplished on the second day of the war . Nakamura eased her fighter under the tanker 's tail , and the boom operator expertly shoved the refueling probe into the back of her fighter . Ten thousand pounds of fuel transferred into her tanks in only a few minutes , and as she disengaged , a small cloud of kerosene vapor escaped into the sky . " Gulliver , this is One-Zero-Four , over , " she called over the radio . " One-Zero-Four , this is Gulliver , " replied a colonel in the passenger compartment of a LearJet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to go . All on-board systems show green . Orbiting at Point Sierra . Ready to initiate intercept climb . Standing by . " " Roger that , One-Zero-Four . " Major Nakamura kept her Eagle in a small turning circle . She did n't want to waste a drop of fuel when she started her climb . She shifted ever so slightly in her seat , which for her was a violent show of emotion when flying , and concentrated on her aircraft . As her eyes traced over her cockpit instruments , she told herself to control her breathing . Space Command 's radars picked up the Soviet satellite as it passed the bulge of South America . Computers compared its course and speed with known data , matched them with the position of Nakamura 's fighter , and a computer spat out its commands , which were relayed to the LearJet . " One-Zero-Four , come to heading two-four-five . " " Turning now . " The major brought her fighter into a tight turn . " Holding on two-four-five . " " Stand by ... stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed her throttles to the stops and punched up the afterburners . The Eagle leaped forward like a spurred horse , accelerating  | through Mach 1 in seconds . Next she eased back on the stick , bringing her Eagle into a forty-five-degree climb , still accelerating into a darkening sky . She did n't look out . Her eyes were locked on her cockpit gauges : the fighter had to maintain a specific flight profile for the next two minutes . As the Eagle rocketed into the sky , the altimeter needle whirled around its clockface . Fifty thousand feet , sixty thousand feet , seventy , eighty , ninety thousand feet . Stars were visible now in the nearly black sky , but Nakamura did n't notice . " Come on , baby , find the son of a bitch ... she thought aloud . Beneath the aircraft the ASAT missile 's tracking head came on , searching the sky for the infrared heat signature of the Soviet satellite . A light blinked on Buns 's instrument panel . " My weapon is tracking ! Repeat , my weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Altitude ninety-four thousand feet seven hundred  --  breakaway , breakaway ! " She felt her aircraft lurch as the heavy missile dropped free and immediately brought her throttles back to low power and brought the stick back to loop the fighter . She checked her fuel state . The afterburning climb had nearly emptied her tanks , but she had enough to make Langley without tanking again . She had already turned for home when she realized that she had n't seen the missile . It did n't matter anyway . Nakamura turned west , letting the Eagle settle into a shallow dive that would terminate on the Virginia Coast . Aboard the LearJet , a tracker camera followed the missile upward . The solid-fuel rocket motor burned for thirty seconds , then the warhead separated . The Miniature Homing Vehicle , an infrared heat sensor embedded in its flat face , had long since acquired its target . The Soviet satellite 's on-board nuclear reactor radiated waste heat out into space , and the resulting infrared signature rivaled the sun . As its microchip brain computed the intercept course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between warhead and satellite dropped at a precipitous rate . The satellite was northbound at eighteen thousand miles per hour , the MHV southbound at over ten thousand , yet another hi-tech kamikaze . Then " Jesus ! " said the senior officer on the LearJet as he blinked his eyes and turned away from the TV screen . Several hundred pounds of steel and ceramic had just turned to vapor . " That 's a kill , say again that 's a kill ! " The TV picture was downlinked to Space Command , where a radar picture backed it up . The massive satellite was now an expanding cloud of orbiting rubble . " Target is negated , " said a calmer voice . LENINSK , KAZAKH S.S.R. The loss of signal from the Kosmos 1801 satellite was recorded scant seconds after it was obliterated from the sky . It was no surprise to the Russian space experts , since I801 has used up its maneuvering thrusters several days he-  | fore , and had been an easy target . Another F-1M rocket booster was sitting on a launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequence countdown would be under way inside of two hours  --  but from now on the ability of the Soviet Navy to locate convoys and fighting fleets would be in jeopardy . LANGLEY AIR FORCE BASE , VIRGINIA " Well ? " Buns asked as she jumped down from her fighter . " Kill . We have it on tape , " another major said . " It worked . " " How soon do you think they 'll launch a replacement ? " One more kill and I 'll be an ace ! " We think they have one on the pad now . Twelve to twenty-four hours . No telling how many spares they have ready . " Nakamura nodded . The Air Force had a total of six remaining ASAT rockets . Maybe enough , maybe not  --  one successful mission did not make it a reliable weapon . She walked over to the squadron headquarters for coffee and donuts . STENDAL , GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC " Goddammit , Pasha ! " CINC-West swore . " I do n't have a four-star deputy so that he can run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have got your head cut off ! " " We needed a breakthrough . The tank commander was killed and his deputy was too young . I have given us the breakthrough . " " Where is Captain Sergetov ? " " Major Sergetov , " Alekseyev corrected . " He performed well as my aide . His hand got carved up and he 's having it attended to . So . What reinforcements do we have moving to the 8th Guards Army ? " Both generals moved over to a large map . " These two tank divisions are already en route  --  ten to twelve hours . How firm is your bridgehead ? " " Could be better , " Alekseyev admitted . " There were three bridges there , hut some madman started dropping rockets into the town and wrecked two of them . That left one . We managed to get a mechanized battalion across , along with some tanks , before the Germans were able to destroy it . They have plenty of artillery support , and when I left , we had boats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be trying to reinforce as soon as he can arrange a crossing in force . " " Opposition ? " " " I'hin , hut the terrain is on their side . I 'd estimate one regiment or so , the remains of other NA " IY ) units . Some tanks , but mainly mechanized infantry . ' I " hey also have plenty of artillery support . When I left it was a very even  | match . We have more firepower , but most of it 's trapped on our side of the Leine . It 's a race to see who can reinforce quickest . " " After you left , NATO threw aircraft in . Our people are trying to hold them back , but NATO seems to be ahead in the air . " " We ca n't wait for night . Those bastards own the night sky . " " Go now ? " Alekseyev nodded , thinking of what casualties he was bringing down on " his " division . " As soon as we can assemble the boats . Expand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What 's NATO bringing in ? " " Radio intercepts have identified two brigades en route . One British and one Belgian . " " They 'll send more than that . They must know what we can do if we exploit this . We have 1st Guards Tank Army in reserve . . . " Commit half of our reserves here ? " " I ca n't think of a better place . " Alekseyev gestured at the map . The drive toward Hannover had been stopped within sight of the city . The northern army groups had gotten into the outskirts of Hamburg , at the cost of gutting 3rd Shock Army 's tank formations . " With luck , we can break all of the 1st into the enemy rear . That will get us to the Weser at least  --  maybe the Rhein . " " A large gamble , Pasha , " CINC-West breathed . But the odds here were better than anything else on the map . If the NATO forces were stretched as thinly as his intelligence staff said , they had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . Start posting the orders . " FASLANE , SCOTLAND " What about their ASW forces ? " asked the captain of USS Pittsburgh . " Considerable . We estimate that Ivan has two major antisubmarinewarfare groups , one centered on Kiev , the other on a Kresta cruiser . There are also four smaller groups , each composed of a Krivak-class frigate and four to six patrol frigates of the Grisha and Mirka type . Add to that a large collection of ASW aircraft and finally twenty or so submarines , half nuclear , half conventional , " answered the briefing officer . " Why do n't we let them keep the Barents Sea ? " muttered Todd Simms of USS Boston . There 's an idea , Dan McCafferty agreed silently . " Seven days to get there ? " Pittsburgh asked . " Yes , that gives us a good deal of freedom on how to enter the area . Captain Little ? " The captain of HMS Torbay took the podium . McCafferty wondered if the Brits had any need for NFL-style noseguards in their team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the shoulders , his head topped by a shock of sandy , unruly hair , James Little certainly looked like one . When he spoke , it was with toughly won assurance . " We 've been running a campaign we call Keypunch . The objective of Keypunch is to evaluate what ASW defenses Ivan has operating in the Barents Sea  --  and also , of course , to lop off the odd Sov who gets in our way . " He smiled . Torbay had four kills . " Ivan 's set a barrier from Bear Island to the coast of Norway . The immediate area around Bear Island is a solid minefield . Ivan 's been laying the things since he took the island by parachute assault two weeks ago . South of this area , so far as we can determine , the barrier is composed of some small minefields and Tango-class diesel subs as a front line , backed by the mobile ASW groups and Victor-Illclass nuclear submarines . Their aim appears to be not so much prosecute-tokill as prosecute-to-drive-off . Every time one of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has been a vigorous response . " Inside the Barents , things are pretty much the same . These small hunterkiller groups can be bloody dangerous . I personally had an encounter with a Krivak and four Grishas . Inshore , they have helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft in direct support , and it was a most unpleasant experience . We also found several new minefields . The Soviets appear to be sowing them almost at random in water as deep as one hundred fathoms . Finally they seem to have set a number of traps . One of them cost us Trafalgar . They set a small minefield and placed a noisemaker within it that sounds exactly like a Tango schnorkeling her diesels . As near as we can make out , Trafalgar moved in to collect the Tango and ran right into a mine . Something to keep in mind , gentlemen . " Little paused to let that bit of hard-won intelligence sink in . " Right . What we intend you chaps to do is head north-northwest towards the edge of the Greenland Icepack , then east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trough . Five days from today three of our submarines will raise pure bloody hell on the barrier , supported by our own ASW aircraft and some fighters if that can be arranged . That ought to get Ivan 's attention and draw his mobile forces west . You should then be able to proceed south to your objective . It 's a roundabout route , of course , but it enables you to use your towed sonars for the maximum period of time , and you should be able to run at relatively high speed at the edge of the icepack without being detected . " McCafferty thought that one over . The edge of the icepack was a noisy place , with billions of tons of ice in constant movement . " " The route has been scouted , by HMS Sceptre and Superb . They encountered minor patrolling only . Two Tangos were found in that area . Our chaps had orders not to engage . " That told the Americans how important this mission was . " ' hey will he waiting for you , so do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " How do we get out ? " Todd Simms wondered . " As quickly as you can . By that time we should have at least one more submarine to assist you . They 'll stay roughly twelve hours ahead of your estimate speed of advance , eliminating any opposition they find . Once you reach the icepack , you 're on your own . Our chaps will be there only as long as it takes to reach the pack . After that they have other duties to perform . We expect that Ivan 's ASW groups will come after you  --  no surprise there , is it ? We 'll try to maintain pressure south of Bear Island to tie down as many as we can , but speed will be your best defense in this case . " The skipper of USS Boston nodded . He could run faster than the Russians could hunt . " Further questions ? " asked Commander , Submarines , Eastern Atlantic . " Good luck , then . We 'll give you all the support we can . " McCafferty leafed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then tucked the ops orders into his back pocket . Operation Doolittle . He and Simms left together . Their submarines were at the same quay . It was a short , quiet drive . They arrived to see Tomahawk missiles being loaded , in Chicago 's case into the twelve vertical tubes installed forward of the pressure hull in the submarine 's bow . Boston was an older boat and had had to offload some of her torpedoes to make room for them . No submarine captain is ever happy offloading torpedoes . " Do n't worry , I 'll back you up , " McCafferty said . " You do that . Looks like they 're almost finished . Be nice to have one more beer , would n't it ? " Simms chuckled . " See you when we get back . " Simms and McCafferty shook hands . A minute later both were below , seeing to the final arrangements for going back to sea . USS PHARRIS The Sikorsky Sea King helicopter was a tight fit on the frigate 's helo deck , but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , all scald/burns and broken limbs , were loaded aboard after the helo was refueled , and Morris watched it lift off for the beach . The captain of what was left of USS Pharris put his cap back on and lit another cigarette . He still did n't know what had gone wrong with that Victor-class . Somehow the Russian skipper had teleported himself from one place to another . " We killed three o ' the bastards , sir , " Chief Clarke appeared at Morris 's side . " Maybe this one just got lucky . " " Reading minds , Chief ? " " Beg pardon , sir . You wanted me to report on some things . The pumps have just about dried things out . I 'd say we 're leaking ten gallons an hour at the crack on the lower starboard corner , hardly worth talking about . The  | bulkhead 's holding , and we got people keeping an eye on it . Same story with the tow cable . Those tugboat guys know their stuff . The engineer reports both boilers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Prairie Masker is operating . The Sea Sparrow is working again in case we need that , but the radars 're still down . " Morris nodded . " Thank you , Chief . How are the men ? " " Busy . Kinda quiet . Mad . " That 's one advantage they have over me , Morris thought . They 're busy . " If you 'll pardon me saying so , skipper , you look awful tired , " Clarke said . The bosun was worried about his captain , but had already said more than he was supposed to . " We 'll all get a good rest soon enough . " SUNNYVALE , CALIFORNIA " We show one bird lifting off , " the watch officer told North American Aerospace Defense Command . " Coming out of Baikonur Kosmodrome on a heading of one-five-five , indicating a probable orbital inclination of sixtyfive degrees . Signature characteristics say it 's either an SS-11 ICBM or an F-1-type space booster . " " Only one ? " " Correct , one bird only . " A lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The missile was on a heading that would take it directly over the central United States in forty to fifty minutes . The rocket in question could be many things . The Russian SS-9 missile , like many American counterparts , was obsolete and had been adapted as a satellite booster rocket . Unlike its American counterparts , it had been originally designed as a **30;0;TOOLONG system : FOBS , a missile that could put a 25-megaton nuclear warhead into a flight path mimicking that of a harmless satellite . " Booster-engine cutoff  --  okay , we show separation and second-stage ignition , " the colonel said on the phone . The Russians would freak if they knew how good our cameras are , he thought . " Flight path continues as before . " Already NORAD had flashed a warning to Washington . If this was a nuclear strike , National Command Authority was ready to react . So many current scenarios began with a large warhead exploded at orbital height over the target country , causing massive electromagnetic damage to communications systems . The SS-9 FOBS system was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . and there 's third-stage ignition . Do you copy our position lix , NORAD ? " " ' That 's a roger , " acknowledged the general under Cheyenne Mountain .  | The signal from the early-warning satellite was linked into NORAD headquarters , and a watch crew of thirty was holding its breath , watching the image of the space booster move across the map projection . Dear God , do n't let it be a nuke .. . Ground-based radar in Australia now tracked the vehicle , showing the climbing third stage and the spent second stage falling into the Indian Ocean . Their information also was linked by satellite to Sunnyvale and Cheyenne Mountain . " That looks like shroud release , " the man in Sunnyvale said . The radar picture showed four new objects fluttering away from the third stage . Probably the protective aluminum shroud needed for atmospheric flight , but unnecessary weight for a space vehicle . People began to breathe more regularly . A reentry vehicle needed such a shroud , but a satellite did not . After five tense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The FOBS did n't do that . An Air Force RC-135 aircraft was already lifting off the ground at Tinker Air Force Base , Oklahoma , its engines firewalled as the flight crew raced the converted 707 airliner to altitude . The roof of what otherwise would be a passenger compartment held a large telescope/camera assembly used to inspect Soviet space vehicles . In the back , technicians activated the sophisticated tracking systems used to lock the camera in on its distant target . " Burnout , " they announced at Sunnyvale . " The vehicle has achieved orbital velocity . Initial numbers look like an apogee of one hundred fifty-six miles and a perigee of one hundred forty-eight . " They 'd have to refine those numbers , but NORAD and Washington needed something right now . " Your evaluation ? " NORAD asked Sunnyvale . " Everything is consistent with a **36;32;TOOLONG launch . The only change is the orbital insertion path was southerly instead of northerly . " Which made perfectly good sense , as everyone knew . Any kind of rocket launched over the pole entailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later they were sure . The crewmen on the RC-135 got good pictures of the new Soviet satellite . Before it had completed its first revolution , it was classified as a RORSAT . The new radar-oceansurveillance satellite would be a problem for the Navy , but not something to end the world . The people in Sunnyvale and Cheyenne Mountain maintained their vigil . ICELAND They followed a footpath around the mountain . Vigdis told them it was a favorite place for tourists to visit . A small glacier on the northern side of the mountain fed a half-dozen streams , which led in turn to a sizable valley full of small farms . They had a fine vantage point . Almost everything in sight  | was below them , including several roads that were kept under constant scrutiny . Edwards debated the advantages of cutting straight across the valley toward their objective or staying on the rough ground to the east . " I wonder what kinda radio station that is , " Smith said . There was a tower of some sort eight miles west of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't listen to the radio . " Not easy to tell from this far , " Edwards observed . " But probably they have some Russians . " He unfolded his big map . This part of the island showed lots of roads , but the information had to be taken with a grain of salt . Only two of the roads had decent surfaces . The rest were called " seasonal " on the map  --  meaning exactly what ? Edwards wondered . Of these , some were well maintained , other were not . The map did n't say which was which . All of the Soviet troops they 'd seen on the ground were driving jeep-type vehicles , not the tracked infantry-carriers they 'd observed on the invasion day . A good driver in a four-by-four could go almost anywhere , however . How good were the Soviets at driving jeeps over broken ground . . . so many things to worry about , Edwards thought . Edwards tracked his field glasses over the area to his west . He saw a twin-prop airliner lift off from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? The Russians are using those puddle jumpers to ferry troops around .. . " Sarge , what do you think ? " Might as well get a professional decision . Smith grimaced . The choice was between physical danger and physical exhaustion . Some choice , he thought . That 's supposed to be why we have officers . " I 'd at least have some patrols down there , Lieutenant . Lots of roads , figure some checkpoints so they can keep an eye on the local folks . Let 's say that radio 's a navigation beacon . It 'll be guarded . Regular radio station 'll be guarded , too . All these farms  --  what kinda farms , Miss Vigdis ? " " Sheep , some milk cows , potatoes , " she answered . " So when the Russkies are off duty , there 'll be some wandering around to get some fresh food instead of their canned crap . We would , too . I do n't much like it , Lieutenant . " Edwards nodded agreement . " Okay , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's always fish . " FASLANE , SCOTLAND Chicago led the procession . A Royal Navy fleet tug had helped her away from the quay , and the American sub was heading out the channel at six knots . They were taking advantage of a " window " in Soviet satellite coverage . It would he at least six hours before another Russian reconnaissance  | satellite came overhead . Behind McCafferty came Boston , Pittsburgh , Providence , Key West , and Groton , at two-mile intervals . " What 's the sounding ? " McCafferty asked over the intercom . " Five hundred seventy feet . " Time . McCafferty ordered the lookouts below . The only ships in sight were aft . Boston was clearly visible , her black sail and twin diving planes gliding over the water like the angel of death . That was apt enough , he thought . The captain of USS Chicago made a final check of the control station atop the sail , then dropped down the ladder , pulling the hatch closed behind him . Another twenty-five feet and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatch , turning the locking wheel as far as it would go . " Straight board shut , " the executive officer reported , going through the official litany that signified that the submarine was rigged for dive . Submariners evolved check lists long before aviators discovered them . McCafferty checked the status boards himself  --  and so , furtively , did several others of the attack center crew . Everything was as it should be . " Dive . Make your depth two hundred feet , " McCafferty ordered . The submarine filled with the sound of rushing air and water , and the sleek black hull began her descent . McCafferty reviewed the chart in his head . Seventy-four hours to the icepack , and turn east . Forty-three hours to Svyatana and turn south . Then came the really hard part . STENDAL , GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC The Battle of Alfeld was turning into a living thing that ate men and tanks like a wolf eats rabbits . Alekseyev chafed at being two hundred kilometers distant from the tank division he now regarded as his own . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things worse . The new commander had staged a successful forced river crossing , putting another two regiments of mechanized infantry on the far bank , and now three ribbon bridges were being built across the Leine  --  or at least a spirited attempt was under way to build them , despite murderous artillery fire from NATO units . " We have created a meeting engagement , ' Pasha , " CINC-West said , staring down at the map . Alekseyev nodded agreement . What had begun as a limited attack was fast becoming the focal point of the whole fighting front . Two more Soviet tank divisions were now near the battle area , racing to the Leine . Three NATO brigades were known to be heading the same way , along with artillery . Both sides were pulling tactical fighters from other sectors , one to smash the bridgehead , the other to support it . The terrain at the front did n't give the SAM crews enough time to discriminate friend from foe . The Russians had many more surface-to-air missiles , and so a free-fire zone had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatically a target for the Russian missiles , while Soviet aircraft kept clear , working instead to locate and kill NATO artillery and reinforcements . That ran contrary to prewar doctrine  --  another gamble , but a favorable one , Alekseyev judged , given his experiences at the front . That was an important lesson not stressed enough in pre-war training : senior commanders had to see what was happening with their own eyes . How did we ever forget that ? Pasha wondered . He fingered the bandage on his forehead . Alekseyev was suffering from a murderous headache , and a doctor had used twelve stitches to close the wound . Crude stitches , the doctor had told him  --  they would leave a scar . His father had had several such scars , all worn with pride . He 'd accept the decoration for this one . " We have the ridge north of the town ! " 20th Tanks ' commander called in . " We 've pushed the Americans off . " Alekseyev took the phone . " How soon on the bridges ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their artillery support is slackening off . They blew one bridging unit to hell , but this one will be completed . I have a battalion of tanks lined up already . The SAMs are doing well . I can see the wreckage of five aircraft from where I 'm standing . I see ? " The General was interrupted by man-made thunder . Alekseyev could do nothing but stare at the telephone receiver . His fist tightened in anger around the handset . " Excuse me . That was close . The final section of bridge is rolling out now . Those engineers have taken terrible losses , Comrade General . They deserve particular attention . The major in command of the unit has been exposed for three hours now . I want the gold star for him . " " Then he 'll get it . " " Good , good  --  the bridge section is off the truck and in the water . If they give us ten minutes to anchor the far end , I 'll get those damned tanks across for you . How long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive just after sunset . " " Excellent ! I must leave now . I 'll be back when we start rolling tanks . " Alekseyev handed the phone back to a junior officer . It was like listening to a hockey game on the radio ! " The next objective , Pasha ? " " Northwest to Hameln and beyond . We might be able to cut off NATO 's northern army groups . If they start to disengage their forces around Hamburg , we go to a general attack and chase them all the way to the English Channel ! I think we have the situation we 've been hoping for . "  | BRUSSELS , BELGIUM At NATO headquarters , staff officers looked at the same maps and reached the same conclusions with less enthusiasm . Reserves were dangerously low  --  yet there was no choice . Men and guns converged on Alfeld in ever increasing numbers . PANAMA It was the biggest transit of U.S. Navy ships in years . The gray hulls used both sides of each lock system , preventing westbound traffic from moving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilots to and from ships ; speed restrictions were broken , regardless of the erosion problems at the Gaillard Cut . Those ships needing refueling had it done as soon as they exited the Canal at the Gatun Locks , then formed an antisubmarine barrier outside Limon Bay . The formation 's transit from Pacific to Atlantic lasted twelve hours under ruthless security . Finished , they departed north at a fleet speed of twenty-two knots . They had to go through the Windward Passage at night .  | BOSTON , MASSACHUSETTS They call it the smell of the sea , Morris thought , but really it 's not . Its the smell of land . It came from the tidal marshes  --  all the things that lived and died and rotted at the water 's edge , all the smells that fermented in the marginal wetlands and when released blew out to sea . Sailors considered it a friendly odor because it meant that land , port , home , family were near . Otherwise it was something to be neutralized with Lysol . As Morris watched , the tug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters . Three harbor tugs came alongside , their crews throwing messenger lines to the frigate 's sailors . When they were secured , Papago cast off and proceeded up the river to refuel . " Good afternoon , Captain . " The harbor pilot had come out on one of the tugs . He looked to have been bringing ships in and out of Boston for fifty years . " And to you , Captain , " Morris acknowledged . " I see you killed three Russian subs ? " " Only one by ourselves . The others are assists . " " How much water are you drawing forward ? " " Just under twenty-five feet  --  no , " Morris had to correct himself . The sonar dome was at the bottom of the Atlantic now . " You did well to bring her back , Captain , " the pilot said , looking forward . " My ' can did n't survive . Before you were born , I guess . Callaghan , seven ninety-two . Assistant gunnery officer , I 'd just made j.g . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteenth kamikaze got through on us.  | Forty-seven men  --  well . " The pilot took the walkie-talkie from his pocket and started giving directions to the tugs . Pharris began to move sideways toward a pier . A medium-sized drydock was straight ahead , but they were not moving that way . " Not the drydock ? " Morris asked , surprised and angry that his ship was being moved to an ordinary pier . " Mechanical problems in the dock . They 're not ready for you yet . Tomorrow , day after for sure . I know how you feel , Captain . Like your kid 's hurt and they wo n't let her in the hospital . Cheer up , I watched mine sink . " It made no sense to grumble , Morris knew . The man was right . If Pharris had n't sunk during the tow , she was safe enough alongside the pier for a day or two . The pilot was an expert . His trained eye measured the wind and the tide , and he gave the proper orders to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cargo pier . Three TV news crews were waiting for them behind a screen of sailors in shore patrol livery . As soon as the brow was rigged , an officer hurried aboard and came right to the bridge . " Captain , I 'm Lieutenant Commander Anders . I have this for you , sir . " He handed over an official-looking envelope . Morris tore it open and found a standard Navy dispatch form . The message ordered him in terse Navy prose to Norfolk by the quickest available transport . " I have a car waiting . You can catch the shuttle to D.C. , then hop a shorthauler to Norfolk . " " What about my ship ? " " That 's my job , Captain . I 'll take good care of her for you . " Just like that , Morris thought . He nodded and went below to pack his gear . Ten minutes later he walked without speaking past the TV cameras and was taken to Logan International Airport . STORNOWAY , SCOTLAND Toland went over the satellite photographs of Iceland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making any use of the old Keflavik field , preferring instead to base their fighters at Reykjavik and the new NATO base . Occasionally , a Backfire or two were landing at Keflavik , bombers with mechanical problems or running short of fuel , but that was it . The northerly fighter sweeps had had their effect , too  --  the Russians were doing their tanking farther north and east now , which had produced a marginal but nevertheless negative effect on the Backfires ' range . The experts estimated that it cut twenty minutes off the time they had to search for convoys . Despite the searching done by the Bears and satellite reconnaissance , only two-thirds of the raids actually launched attacks . Toland did n't know why . Was there a p 391 problem with Soviet communications ? If so , could they find a way to exploit it ? The Backfires were still hurting the convoys , and badly . After considerable Navy prodding , the Air Force was starting to base fighters in Newfoundland , Bermuda , and the Azores . Supported by tankers borrowed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat air patrol over those convoys they could reach . There was no hope of actually breaking up a Backfire raid , but they could start thinning the Bears out . The Soviets had only about thirty of the wide-ranging Bear-D reconnaissance aircraft . Roughly ten flew every day with their powerful Big Bulge radars turned on to guide the bombers and submarines in on the convoys , which made them relatively easy to find , if a fighter could be put out there to find them . After much experimentation , the Russians had fallen into a predictable pattern of air operations . They would be made to pay for that . Tomorrow the Air Force would have a two-plane patrol over six different convoys . The Russians would be made to pay a toll for basing aircraft on Iceland , too . " I make it a regiment , say twenty-four to twenty-seven aircraft . All MiG-29 Fulcrums , " Toland said . " We never seem to see more than twentyone on the ground . I figure they 're running a fairly steady combat air patrol , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear to have three ground-based radars , and they 're moving them around a lot . That probably means that they 're set up for ground-controlled intercepts . Any problem jamming the search radars ? " A fighter pilot shook his head . " With the right support , no . " " So we 'll just have to flush the MiGs off the ground and kill some . " The commanders of both Tomcat squadrons were with Toland , examining the maps . " Want to keep clear of those SAMs , though . From what the guys in Germany say , the SA-11 is very bad news . " The first Air Force effort to flatten Keflavik with B-52s had been a disaster . Follow-up efforts with smaller , faster FB-111s had harassed the Russians but could not put Keflavik totally out of business . SAC was unwilling to part with enough of its fastest strategic bombers to do this . There still had not been a successful mission against the main fuel-storage site . It was too close to a populated area , and satellite photos revealed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's get the Air Force to try another B-52 mission , " one fighter jock suggested . " They come in like before , except ... " He outlined some changes in the attack profile . " Now that we have our Queers with us , it might work out all right . " " If you want my help , Commander , you might at least be a little polite  | million-dollar aircraft referred to by that nickname . " I can knock those SAM radars back some , just keep in mind that SA-11 has a backup infrared tracker system . You get within ten miles of the launchers , they have an even-money chance of smoking your Tomcat right out of the sky . " The really nasty thing about the SA-11 , pilots had learned , was that it left almost no exhaust trail , which made it very hard to spot , and it was even harder to evade a SAM you could n't see . " We 'll stay clear of Mr. SAM . First time , gentlemen , we got the odds on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan together . They now had solid intelligence of how Russian fighters operated in combat . The Soviets had good tactics , but they were also predictable . If the American aircraft could contrive to present a situation for which the Russians were trained , they knew how Ivan would react to it . STENDAL , GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC He had never expected it to be easy , but neither had Alekseyev expected NATO air forces to have control of the night skies . Four minutes after midnight , an aircraft that had never registered on their radar had obliterated the radio transmitter station for CINC-West 's headquarters . They 'd only had three alternate stations , each more than ten kilometers from the underground bunker complex . Now they had one , plus a mobile transmitter that had already been bombed once . The underground telephone cables were still being used , of course , but advances into enemy territory had made telephone communications unreliable . Too often , the cables strung by Signal Corps troops were being destroyed by air attack and badly driven vehicles . They needed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'd even attempted an attack on the bunker complex itself  --  the decoy site set exactly between two transmitter stations had been hit by eight fighterbombers and liberally sprinkled with napalm , cluster munitions , and delayfused high explosives . If the attack had been on the real complex , the ordnance experts said , there might have been casualties . So much for the skill of our engineers . The bunkers were supposed to withstand a near-miss from a nuclear warhead . He now had a full fighting division across the Leine  --  the remains of one , he corrected himself . The two reinforcing tank divisions were trying to cross now , but the ribbon bridges had been bombed overnight along with the advancing divisions . The NATO reinforcements were beginning to arrive ? their road advances had also suffered from air attacks , though at ghastly cost to the Soviet fighter-bombers . The tactics . . . no , amateurs discuss tactics , Alekseyev thought wryly . Professional soldiers study logistics . The key to his success would pivot on his ability to maintain bridges on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Alfeld . The traffic-control  | system had already broken down twice before Alekseyev had dispatched a team of colonels to handle things . " We should have picked a better place , " Alekseyev muttered . " Excuse me , Comrade General ? " Sergetov asked . " There 's only one good road into Alfeld . " The General smiled ironically . " We should have made our breakthrough at a town with at least three . " They watched wooden counters march  --  creep  --  down the line on the map . Each counter was a battalion . Missile and antiaircraft-gun units lined the corridor north and south of this road , and the road itself constantly swept to rid it of the remotely deployed mines that NATO was using in large numbers for the first time . " Twentieth Tanks has taken a serious mauling , " the General breathed . His troops . It might have been a quick breakthrough  --  should have been but for NATO aircraft . " The two reinforcing divisions will complete the maneuver , " Sergetov predicted confidently . Alekseyev thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , VIRGINIA Morris sat across the deck from COMNAVSURFLANT : Commander , Naval Surface Forces , U.S. Atlantic Fleet . A three-star admiral , he 'd spent his whole career in what he liked to call " the real Navy , " frigates , destroyers , and cruisers . The small gray ships lacked the glamour of aviation and the mystery of the submarines , but right now they were the key to getting the convoys across the Atlantic . " Ivan 's changed tactics on us  --  a hell of a lot faster than we thought he was able to . They 're going for the escorts . The attack on your frigate was deliberate , you did n't just stumble across him . He was probably laying for you . " " They 're trying to roll back the escorts ? " " Yes , but with particular attention to the ships with tails . We 've hurt their submarine force  --  not enough , but we have hurt them . The towed-array pickets have worked out very well . Ivan picked up on that and he 's trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SURTASS ships , too , but that 's a harder proposition . We 've killed three submarines that tried to move in on them . " Morris nodded . The Surface Towed-Array Sonar Ships were modified tuna clippers that trailed enormous passive sonar cables . There were n't enough of them to provide coverage for more than half the convoy routes , but they fed good information into ASW headquarters in Norfolk . " Why do n't they send Backfires after the ships ? " " We 've wondered about that , too . Evidently the Russians do n't think they 're worth the diversion of that much effort . Besides , we 've got a lot more  | electronic capability built into them than anyone thought . They 're not easy to locate on radar . " The Admiral went no further than that , but Morris wondered if stealth technology  --  which the Navy had been working on for years  --  had been applied to the SURTASS force . If the Russians were limiting their effort to locate and kill the tuna boats with submarines , he thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for a decoration , Ed . You did very well . I 've only got three skippers who 've done better , and one of them was killed yesterday . So how bad was your damage ? " " She may be a total loss , sir . It was a Victor . We took one hit in the bow . The keel let go , and  --  the bow tore off , sir . We lost everything forward of the ASROC launcher . Lots of shook damage , but most of it 's already fixed . Before she 'll sail again , we have to build her a new bow . " The Admiral nodded . He 'd already seen the casualty reports . " You did well to save her , Ed . Damned well . Pharris does n't need you for the moment . I want you here with my operations people . We have to change tactics , too . I want you to look over what intelligence and operational information we have and feed me some ideas . " " For starters , we might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked on . " The reply held both confidence and skepticism . THE WINDWARD PASSAGE To the east was Haiti on the island of Hispaniola . To the west was Cuba . Blacked out , radar systems fully energized but placed on standby , the ships sailed in battle formation , escorted by destroyers and frigates . Missiles were hung on launchers and trained out to port , while the launch controllers sweated in their air-conditioned battle stations . They did n't expect trouble . Castro had gotten word to the American government that he had had no part in this , and was angered that the Soviets had not informed him of their plans . It was diplomatically important , however , that the American fleet traverse the passage in darkness so that the Cubans could say truthfully that they had seen nothing . As a sign of good faith , Castro had also alerted the Americans to the presence of a Soviet submarine in the Florida Straits . To be used as a vassal was one thing , to have his country used as a base for a war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know all of this , just that no serious opposition was expected . They took it with a grain of salt , as they did all intelligence reports . Their helicopters had laid a string of sonobuoys , and their ESM radar receivers listened for the pulsing signal of a Soviet-made radar . Aloft , lookouts trained clumsy starlight scopes around the sky , searching for aircraft that  | might be hunting them visually  --  which would not be hard . At twenty-five knots , every ship left a foaming wake that seemed to fluoresce like neon in the darkness . Maalox did n't work anymore , one frigate captain grumbled to himself . He sat in the command chair in his ship 's Combat Information Center . To his left was the chart table , in front of him ( he faced aft ) the young tactical action officer stood over his plotting scope . The Cubans were known to have surface-to-surface missile batteries arrayed on their coastline like the fortresses of old . At any moment the ships might detect a swarm of incoming vampires . Forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as were his three-inch gun and CIWS topside . The coffee was a mistake , but he had to stay alert . The price was a stabbing pain in his upper abdomen . Maybe I should talk to the corpsman , he thought , and shrugged it off . There was n't time for that . He 'd been working around the clock for three months to get his ship ready for action , racing through the acceptance trials and conducting continuous workups , working his men and ship hard , but working himself hardest of all . He was too proud to admit that he 'd pushed too hard , even to himself . It came just as he finished his third cup of coffee . For all the warnings , it was a pain as severe and surprising as a thrown knife . The captain doubled over and vomited on the tiled deck of CIC . A sailor mopped it up at once , and it was too dark to see that there 'd been blood on the tile . He could n't leave his post , despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The captain made a mental note to keep off the coffee for a few hours . Maybe he 'd see the corpsman when he got the chance . If he got the chance . There 'd be a three-day layover in Norfolk . He could rest a little then . He knew he needed rest . The fatigue that had been building for days hammered at him . The captain shook his head . Throwing up was supposed to make you feel better . VIRGINIA BEACH , VIRGINIA Morris found his home empty . At his suggestion , his wife was gone home to Kansas to stay with her family . No sense having you and the kids home worrying about me , he 'd told her . He regretted it now . Morris needed the company , needed a hug , needed to see his kids . Within a minute of opening the door , he was on the phone . His wife already knew what had happened to his ship , but had withheld it from the kids . It took two minutes to assure her that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then came the kids , and finally the knowledge that they could n't arrange a flight home . All the airliners were either ferrying men and supplies overseas or booked solid until mid August . Ed saw no sense in having his family drive all the way from Salinas to Kansas City to wait on standby . Good-byes were hard .  | What came next was harder . Commander Edward Morris donned his whites and from his wallet took a list of family calls he had to make . They 'd all been officially notified , but another of the duties that came with command was to make the trips himself . The widow of his executive officer lived only half a mile away . A good man with a barbecue , the XO , Morris remembered . How many weekends had he spent in their backyard watching steaks sizzle over charcoal ? What would he tell her now ? What would he tell the rest of the widows ? What would he tell the kids ? Morris walked to his car and was mocked by the license plate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around with him . Most were fortunate enough to leave it behind . As he started the engine , Morris wondered if he 'd ever be able to sleep without the fear of reliving again that moment on the bridge of his ship . ICELAND For the first time Edwards had beaten his sergeant at his own game . For all his alleged expertise with a fishing rod , Smith had come away with nothing after an hour 's effort , and handed the rod to Mike in disgust . Ten minutes later , Edwards landed a four-pound trout . " Ai n't that some shit , " Smith growled . The last ten kilometers they 'd covered had taken eleven hours . The one road they 'd had to cross , they learned , was a busy one . Every few minutes a vehicle headed north or south . The Russians were using this gravel strip as their principal means of overland travel to Iceland 's northern coast . Edwards and his party had spent six hours hiding in the rocks of yet another lava field , watching and waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen Mi-24 helicopters patrolling the area , but neither had come close . They 'd seen no foot patrols either , and Edwards had concluded that Iceland was too big for the Soviet force to control . At that point he 'd taken out his Russian map and set to analyzing the symbols . The Soviet troops were concentrated in an arc extending north and south of the Reykjavik peninsula . He 'd radioed that into Scotland , spending ten minutes describing the Russian symbology . Road traffic had dropped off at dusk , allowing them to cross the road on the run . They 'd found themselves without food in another area of lakes and streams . Enough was enough , Edwards had decided . They had to rest again and began fishing to get themselves some food . The next leg of their journey would keep them well clear of inhabited areas . His rifle and other gear lay next to a rock , covered with his camouflage jacket . Vigdis was with him . She 'd hardly left his side all day . Smith and the Marines had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work . The local hug population was out in force today . His sweater kept most of '  | them off his skin , but his face attracted their share . He tried to ignore them . Quite a few bugs had found their way to the surface of the stream , and the trout were going after them . Every time he saw a ripple , he cast the feathery lure toward it . The rod bent again . " Got another one ! " he hooted . Smith 's head came up , shook angrily , and went back down in the bushes fifty yards away . Edwards had never done this sort of fishing . All his experience were in his father 's boat , but the principles were pretty much the same . He let the trout pull against the line , but not too much , just enough to wear him out as Edwards worked the rod up and down , drawing the fish upstream and into the rocks . Suddenly he tripped over a rock and fell into the shallow water , managing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet , he stepped back , his fatigue pants black and wet against his legs . " This is a big one . " He turned to see Vigdis laughing . She watched him work the fish in and began moving toward it . A minute later she grabbed the leader and pulled the trout clear of the water . " Three kilos , this one . " She held it up . At age ten Mike had caught a hundred-pound albacore , but this brown trout looked a lot bigger . He reeled in the line as Vigdis walked toward him . Ten pounds of fish in twenty minutes , he thought . We might just be able to live off the land yet . The helicopter appeared without warning . There was a westerly wind  --  it had probably been patrolling the road to the east  --  and the aircraft was less than a mile away before they heard the stuttering sound of its five-bladed rotor headed right toward them . " Everyone freeze ! " Smith yelled . The Marines were in good cover , but Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , " Edwards breathed . He finished reeling his line in . " Take the fish off the hook . Relax . " She looked at him as the helicopter approached , afraid to turn around toward the incoming chopper . Her hands shook as she worked the hook free of the wriggling trout . " It 's going to be all right , Vigdis . " He wrapped his arm about her waist and walked slowly away from the stream . Her arm pulled his body close against hers . It came as a greater shock than the Russian chopper . She was stronger than he 'd expected , and her arm was a heated path around his back and chest . The chopper was less than five hundred yards off , bearing directly at them , nose down , the multibarreled gun trained directly at them . le 'd never make it , Edwards saw . His rifle was fifty feet away under his camouflage jacket . If he moved fast enough to get there , they 'd know why . His legs were weak beneath him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved the hand in which she held the fish . She used two lingers to grab Mike 's hand at her waist , moving it up and around  | until it rested on her left breast . Then she held the fish high above her head . Mike dropped his rod and stooped to get the other trout . Vigdis followed his movements and managed to keep his left hand in place . Mike held up his fish as the Mi-24 attack helicopter hovered fifty yards away . Its rotor tossed up a circle of spray from the surrounding marsh . " Go away , " Mike rasped through his grinning teeth . " My father loves to fish , " the senior lieutenant said , manipulating the flight controls to Hover . " Shit on the fish , " the gunner snapped back . " I want to catch one of those . Look where that young bastard has his hand ! " They probably do n't even know what 's going on , he thought . Or if they know , they have sense enough not to do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untouched by the madness that 's sweeping the world .. . The pilot looked down at his fuel gauges . " They look harmless enough . We 're down to thirty minutes ' fuel . Time to return . " The chopper settled at the tail , and for a terrible moment Edwards thought it might be landing . Then it pivoted in midair and moved to the southwest . One of the soldiers riding in the back waved at them . Vidgis waved back . They stood there as it flew off . Their hands came down , and her left arm held his tight against her . Edwards had not realized that Vigdis did n't wear a bra . He was afraid to move his hand , afraid to appear to make an advance . Why had she done that ? To help fool the Russians  --  to reassure him , or herself ? That it had in fact worked seemed unimportant . The Marines were still concealed . They stood there quite alone , and his left hand seemed to bum as his mind stumbled over what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand slid away as she turned to him and buried her head against his shoulder . Here I am holding the prettiest girl I ever met in one hand , Edwards thought , and a Goddamned fish in the other . That was easily solved . Edwards dropped the fish , wrapped both arms around her , and held on tight . " Are you all right ? " She looked up at his face . " I think yes . " There was only one word for what he felt toward the girl in his arms . Edwards knew this was n't the time , and was n't the place , but the look and the word remained . He kissed her gently on the cheek . The smile that answered him counted more than all the passionate encounters of his life . " Excuse me , folks , " Sergeant Smith said from a few feet away .  | " Yeah . " Edwards disengaged himself . " Let 's get moving before they decide to come back . " USS CHICAGO Things were going well . American P-3C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icepack . The submarines had been forced to detour east around one suspected Russian submarine , but that was all . Ivan was sending most of his boats south , it seemed , confident that the Norwegian Sea was under his control . Another six hours to the pack . Chicago was drifting now , finished with her turn at the head of the " freight train " procession of submarines . Her sonar gear searched the black water for the telltale noise of a Russian submarine . They heard nothing but the distant growling of the icepack . The tracking team plotted the position of the other American submarines . McCafferty was glad to see they had trouble doing so , even with America 's best sonar equipment . If they had trouble , so would the Russians . His crew looked to be in good shape . Three days on the beach had counted for a lot . The beer supplied by the Norwegian skipper , plus word on what their Harpoon had done in Chicago 's one real engagement , had counted for even more . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information was accepted quietly , with a couple of jokes about going back home  --  to the Barents Sea . " That was Boston , skipper , " the XO said . " Now we 're the caboose . " McCafferty walked back to examine the chart . Everything looked okay , but he checked everything carefully . With so many submarines running the same course track , the risk of collision was real . A quartermaster ran down the list of the sister subs that had passed Chicago . The skipper was satisfied . " All ahead two-thirds , " he ordered . The helmsman acknowledged the order and twisted the annunciator dial . " Engine room answers all ahead two-thirds . " " Very well . Left ten degrees rudder . Come to new course three-foureight . " Chicago accelerated to fifteen knots , taking her station at the end of the column as the freight train raced to the Arctic .  | VIRGINIA BEACH , VIRGINIA " Left full rudder ! " Morris screamed , pointing at the torpedo 's wake . " Right full rudder , aye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then left , then centering it . Morris stood on the port bridge wing . The sea was flat calm , and the torpedo 's wake was clearly visible , following every turn and maneuver the frigate made . He even tried reversing , and that did n't work  --  the torpedo appeared to go sideways . It stopped dead in the water and rose to the surface where he could see it . It was white , with what seemed to be a red star on the nose . . . and it had eyes , like all homing torpedoes . He ordered flank speed , but the torpedo stayed with him on the surface now , skimming along like a flying fish , clearly visible to all who could see  --  but only Morris saw it . It closed ever so slowly as the frigate maneuvered . Fifty feet , thirty , ten ... " Where did my daddy go ? " the little girl asked . " I want my daddy ! " " What 's the problem , skipper ? " the exec asked . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head Sweat poured from Morris 's face as he bolted upright in his bed , his heart racing . The digital clock on the headboard said 4:54 . Ed got up and walked shakily into the bathroom to splash cold water on his face . The second time tonight , he thought . Twice more during the tow back to Boston the nightmare had come , robbing him of the few hours of rest he allowed himself . Morris wondered if he had screamed in his sleep .  | You did everything you could have done . It 's not your fault , he told the face in the mirror . But you were the captain , it replied . Morris had gotten through five homes when he 'd had to stop . It was one thing to talk to wives and parents . They understood . Their sons and husbands were sailors , and had taken a sailor 's risk . But the four-year-old daughter of Gunner 's Mate Second Class Jeff Evans had not understood why her daddy would never come home again . A second-class petty officer did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked like a madman on that little house to make it as neat as it was . A good man with his hands , he remembered , a good gunner 's mate . Every wall was newly painted . Much of the interior woodwork had been replaced . They 'd been in the house only seven months , and Morris wondered how the petty officer had found the time to get all that work done . He had to have done it himself . No way he could have afforded contractors . Ginny 's room had been a testimony to her father 's love . Dolls from all over the world had stood on hand-made shelves . As soon as he 'd seen Ginny 's room , Morris had had to leave . He 'd felt himself on the verge of breaking down , and some absurd code of conduct would n't allow him to do that in front of strangers . So he 'd left and driven home , with the rest of the list tucked back in his wallet . Certainly the fatigue that had enveloped him would allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in front of the mirror , looking at a man with hollow eyes who wished his wife were there . Morris went out to the kitchen of his one-story house and went mindlessly through the process of making coffee . The morning paper was on the doorstep , and he found himself reading stories about the war that he knew to be inaccurate or out of date . Things were happening much too fast for reporters to keep up . There was an eyewitness account from an unnamed destroyer about a missile that had leaked through her missile defenses . An " analysis " piece explained how surface warships were obsolete in the face of determined missile attacks and asked where the fleet 's vaunted carriers were . That , he thought , was a pretty good question . Morris finished his coffee and returned to the bathroom for a shower . If he had to be awake , he thought , he might as well be at work . He had one set of undress whites in the closet . He donned them a few minutes later and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he drove to the Norfolk Navy Base . Forty minutes later he was in one of several operations rooms , where the positions of convoys and suspected submarine locations were plotted . On the far wall the threat hoard listed estimated Russian assets and the numbers and types of kills accumulated to date . Another wall showed losses . If the intel guys were right , he thought , the war at sea had the look of a draw  --  but for the Russians a draw was the same as a win .  | " Good morning , Commander , " COMNAVSURFLANT said . Another man who had not slept very much . " You look a little better . " Better than what ? Morris wondered . " We have some good news for a change . " NORTH ATLANTIC The B-52 crews were nervous despite the heavy fighter escort . Five thousand feet above them , a full squadron of F-14 Tomcats flew top cover , having just refueled from KC-135 tankers . The other squadron was tanking now for their part in the mission . The sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below them was still dark . It was 0300 local time , when human reaction times are at their worst . KEFLAVIK , ICELAND The alarm klaxon jolted the sleeping Russian pilots off their cots . Their ground crews took fewer than ten seconds to begin preflight procedures as the airmen climbed the steel ladders into their cockpits and plugged in their helmet radios to learn what the emergency was . " Heavy enemy jamming activity to the west , " the regimental commander announced . " Plan Three . Repeat : Plan Three . " In the control trailer , radar operators had just seen their radar screens turn to a cluttered nightmare of white-noise jamming . An American raid was coming in  --  probably B-52s , probably in force . Soon the American aircraft would be so close that the ground-based radars could burn through the jamming . Until then , the fighters would try to engage as far out as they could to reduce the number of bombers before they could strike their target . The Soviet pilots had been well drilled in their time on Iceland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in seven all were in the air . The Soviet plan left a third of the fighters over Keflavik while the others charged west toward the jamming , their own missile-targeting radars on , seeking targets . They were ten minutes out when the jamming stopped . A single MiG got a radar contact off a retreating jamming aircraft and radioed Keflavik , only to learn from his ground controllers that nothing was on the scopes out to a range of three hundred kilometers . A minute later , the jamming began again , this time from the south and east . More cautiously this time , the MiGs flew south . On orders , they kept their radar systems shut down until they were a hundred miles offshore , but when they switched on they found nothing . Whoever was jamming was doing it from a great distance . The ground controllers reported that three jammers had been involved in the first incident and four in the second . Quite  | a lot of jammers , the regimental commander thought . They 're trying to run us around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come east , " he ordered his flight leaders . The B-52 crews were really nervous now . One of the escorting Prowlers had picked up the voice radio orders from the MiGs , and another had caught a flash of their air-intercept radars to the southwest . The fighters eased south also . They were now one hundred fifty miles from Keflavik , crossing the Icelandic coast . The mission commander evaluated the situation and ordered the bombers to turn slightly north . The B-52s carried no bombs , just the powerful radar jammers designed to allow other bombers to reach targets within the Soviet Union . Below them , the second squadron of Tomcats was heading for the deck , the eastern slopes of the Vatna glacier . With them were four Navy Prowlers for additional protection against air-to-air missiles in case the MiGs got too close . " Starting to get some airborne radars , bearing two-five-eight . Seems to he closing , " one Prowler reported . Another copied the same signal and they triangulated the range to fifty miles . Close enough . The mission commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , Amber Moon . " The B-52s turned back east and dove , opening their bomb bays to disgorge tons of aluminum chaff that no radar signal could penetrate . As soon as they saw that , the American fighters all dropped their external fuel tanks , and the Prowlers broke off from the bombers to orbit just west of the chaff . Now came the tricky part . The fighters of both sides were closing at a combined speed of over one thousand miles per hour . " Queer check , " the mission commander radioed . " Blackie check , " acknowledged the skipper of VF-41 . " Jolly check , " replied the commander of VF-84 . Everyone was in position . " Execute . " The four Prowlers flipped on their antimissile jamming gear . The twelve Tomcats of the Jolly Rogers were strung on a line at thirty thousand feet . On command they activated their missile-guidance radars . " American fighters ! " shouted a number of Russian pilots . Their threat receivers instantly told the pilots that fighter-type radars were locked on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely the Americans would not risk their heavy bombers again without a proper escort . He 'd iF'norc these and bore in for the B-52s , as his training dictated . The MiG radar ' were heavily jammed , their ranges cut in half and as yet unable to  | track any targets at all . He ordered his pilots to be alert for incoming missiles , confident that they could avoid those that they saw , and had all his aircraft increase power . Next , he ordered all but two of his reserve force to leave Keflavik and come east to support him . The Americans needed only seconds to lock onto targets . Each Tomcat carried four Sparrows and four Sidewinders . The Sparrows went first . There were sixteen MiGs in the air . Most had at least two missiles targeted , but the Sparrows were radar-guided . Each American fighter had to remain pointed at its target until the missile hit . This ran the risk of closing within range of Soviet missiles , and the Tomcats were not equipped with protective jammers . The Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their radars began to burn through the American jamming , the Sparrows arrived , the first directly from the sun , exploding its MiG in midair and warning everyone in its flight . The Soviet aircraft began radical jinks up and down , some pilots breaking into hard turns as they saw the seven-inch wide missiles racing in , but four more found their targets , and in moments there were three hard kills and one severely damaged aircraft that turned to limp for home . The Jolly Rogers turned as soon as their missiles were spent and ran northeast with the Soviets in pursuit . The Russian commander was relieved that the American missiles had performed so poorly , yet still enraged at the loss of five aircraft . His remaining aircraft bore in on afterburner as their targeting radars began to defeat the American jamming . The American fighter escort had had its turn , he knew . Now it was his turn . They ran northeast , their visored eyes alternating between squints into the sun and quick looks at their radarscopes to pick out targets . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target and launched two missiles . Twenty thousand feet below them , shielded from ground radar by a pair of mountains , twelve Tomcats of the Black Aces went to afterburner , their radars shut off as the twin-engined fighters rocketed skyward . Within ninety seconds the pilots began to hear the growling signal that indicated their Sidewinder heat-seeking missiles were tracking targets . Seconds later , sixteen missiles were fired from a range of two miles . Six Russian pilots never knew what hit them . Of the eleven MiGs , eight were hit in a matter of seconds . The commander 's luck remained briefly as he jerked his fighter around , causing a Sidewinder to break lock and fly into the  | sun , but now what could he do ? He saw two Tomcats running south , away from his remaining fighters . It was too late to organize an attack  --  his wingman was gone , and the only friendly aircraft he could see was to his north ? so the colonel reefed his MiG into an eight-g turn and dove at the American , oblivious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sparrows launched from the second group of Black Aces struck his wing . The MiG came apart around him . The Americans had no time to gloat . The mission commander reported a second group of MiGs heading their way and the American squadrons regrouped to meet them , forming a solid wall of twenty-four aircraft , their radars shut down for two minutes as the MiGs raced into the cloud of jamming . The Russian second-in-command was making a serious error . His fellow pilots were in danger . He had to go to their rescue . One group of Tomcat volleyed off its remaining Sparrows ; the other fired Sidewinders . A total of thirty-eight missiles closed in on eight Soviet aircraft who had no clear picture of what they were running into . Half of them never did , blotted out of the sky by American air-to-air missiles ; three more were damaged . The Tomcat pilots all wanted to close , but the commander ordered them off . They were all short of fuel , and Stornoway was seven hundred miles off . They turned east , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B-52s . The Americans would claim thirty-seven kills , quite a score since they had expected a total of only twenty-seven Russian aircraft . In fact , of twenty-six MiGs , only five undamaged aircraft remained . A stunned air base commander immediately began rescue operations . Soon the parachute division 's attack helicopters were flying northeast , searching for downed pilots . STENDAL , GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC Thirty kilometers from Alfeld to Hameln , Alekseyev thought . An hour 's drive in a tank . Elements of three divisions were making that drive now , and since the crossing had been achieved , they 'd advanced a total of only eighteen kilometers . This time it was the English : the tanks of the Royal Tank Reginient and 21st Lancers had stopped his leading elements cold halfway to Ilameln and had n't budged in eighteen hours . There was real danger here . For a mechanized formation , safety lay in movement . The Soviets were feeding units into the gap , but NATO was using its air power to the utmost . The bridges on the Leine were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Engineers had prepared cwssing points on the riverbanks , and the Russians were able to swim their  | infantry carriers across now , but the tanks could n't swim , and every attempt to run them across underwater  --  as they were supposedly equipped to do been a failure . Too many units had had to be deployed to protect the breach in NATO 's lines , and too few were able to exploit it . Alekseyev had achieved a perfect textbook breakthrough  --  only to see that the other side had its own textbook for containing and smashing it . Western Theater had a total of six reserve class-A divisions to send into the fighting . After that they would have to start using class-B units composed of reservists , with older men and equipment . There were many of them , but they would not  --  could not  --  perform as well as the younger soldiers . The General bridled at the necessity of committing units to battle that would certainly take higher casualties than normal . But he had no choice . His political masters wanted it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have to go back forward , " Alekseyev told his boss . " Yes , but no closer than five kilometers to the front line , Pasha . I can not afford to lose you now . " BRUSSELS , BELGIUM The Supreme Allied Commander , Europe , looked at his own tally sheet . Nearly all of his reserves were committed to the fighting now , and the Russians seemed to have an endless supply of men and vehicles moving forward . His units had no time to reorganize and redeploy . NATO faced the nightmare of all armies : they could only react to the moves of their opponent , with almost no chance to launch their own initiatives . So far things were holding together  --  but only barely . Southeast of Hameln his map showed a British brigade . In fact it was nothing more than a reinforced regiment composed of exhausted men and damaged equipment . Artillery and aircraft were all that allowed him to prevent a collapse , and even that would not be enough if his units did n't get much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to two weeks of ordnance , and the resupply coming from America had been seriously impeded by attacks on the convoys . What could he tell his men ? Reduce munitions expenditures  --  when the only thing stopping the Russians was the profligate use of every weapon at hand ? His morning intelligence brief was starting . The chief NATO intelligence officer was a German general who was accompanied by a Dutch major carrying a videotape cassette . For something this important , the intel officer knew , SACEUR wanted to see the raw data , not just the analysis . The Dutch officer set up the machine . A computer-generated map appeared , then units showed up . The tape took under two minutes to display five hours of data , repeating it several times so that the officers could discern patterns . " General , we estimate that the Soviets are sending six full divisions  | towards Alfeld . The movement you see here on the main road from Braunschweig is the first of them . The others come from their theater reserve , and these two coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " So you think that they are making this their main point of attack ? " SACEUR asked . " Ja . " The German General nodded . " The Schwerpunkt is here . " SACEUR frowned . The rational thing to do would be to withdraw behind the river Weser to shorten his defensive line and reorganize his forces . But that would mean abandoning Hannover . The Germans would never accept that . Their own national strategy of defending each home and field had cost the Russians dear  --  and stretched NATO forces to the breaking point . Politically they would never accept such a strategic withdrawal . West German units would fight on alone if they had to : he could see it clearly enough in the eyes of his own intelligence chief . And if somebody invaded New Hampshire , he admitted to himself , would I withdraw into Pennsylvania ? An hour later , half of the existing NATO reserves were heading east from Osnabruck to Hameln . The battle for Germany would be won or lost on the right bank of the Weser . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As soon as they landed , the British and American ground crewmen refueled and rearmed the fighters . The Russians were raiding the British northern airfields more carefully now . The American airborne radar aircraft supporting the British Nimrods and Shackletons were making life hard on the twin-engine Blinder bombers flying out of Andoya in Norway . Royal Air Force Tornados flew combat air-patrol missions two hundred miles offshore while the American pilots rested , a few enterprising crew chiefs painted red stars underneath the cockpits , and intelligence officers evaluated gunsight videotapes and recordings of Soviet missile radars . " Looks like we hurt them , " Toland judged . The kill claims were too high , but with fighter pilots they always were . " Bet your ass ! " replied the commander of the Jolly Rogers . The Navy commander chewed on a cigar . He claimed personal credit for a pair of MiGs . " Question is , will they reinforce ? It worked once , but they wo n't fall for that gag again . You tell me , Toland : can they replace what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The MiG-29 is about the only fighter they can stage out that far . The rest of those are in Germany , and they 've taken a beating there , too . If the Russians decide to cut loose some MiG-31s , I think they can reach that far , hut I do n't see them releasing their prime bomber-interceptor for this
