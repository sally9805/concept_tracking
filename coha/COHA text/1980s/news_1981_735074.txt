txt Allis-Chalmers corp . said it plans significant reductions in farm machinery output , signaling what analysts say is likely to be a deep new round of production cutbacks in the farm equipment industry . The problem is persistently high interest rates , which have hurt business at almost every level of the agricultural chain . Depressed commodity prices , high borrowing costs for farmers and high carrying costs for equipment makers and dealers have created unsettling prospects for factories as they prepare for their autumn selling season . In the current environment , a sound balance sheet is important and prudence dictates that we take this action , " said David Scott , chairman and chief executive officer . in announcing Allis-Chalmers cutbacks . A spokesman for Milwaukee-based AllisChalmers said the company did n't know how soon , severe or lasting the cutbacks might be . But Mr. Scott said : " There Is n't any question that along with widespread price cutting and concessional financing programs , these reduced production schedules will have an adverse impact on earnings and employment for the rest of the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was closely following its farm equipment markets " to assess potential demand in relation to our production schedules for the remainder of 1981 and early 1982 . " Robert A Hansen , Deere 's president , said yesterday , " At the present time , we do n't have any specific plans to reduce production . " But he added that " as we move into the fall selling season we 'll be looking very carefully at activity in the marketplace , " as well as commodity prices and interest rates , and " we 'll react accordingly . " Analysts already have reacted . Jerry A. Anderson of Sanford C. Bernstein &; Co. , citing " rampant price discounting " and other problems in the industry , cut his estimate of Deere 's 1981 net Income to $259.4 million from the $299.7 million he previously predicted . Mr. Anderson also cut his earlier estimates of industry-wide tractor sales by 12'r to 239,100 units and his estimate of combine sales by 13% to 34.600 . Eli S. Lustgarten of Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins Inc. also has cut his forecasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When you 've got high inventories to the degree this industry does , and your markets are weak , the only way to liquidate inventones is to cut production , " Mr. Lustgarten said . Even the Farm and Industrial Equipment Institute , a trade group in Chicago . finds reasons for concern . A spokesman said " 1980 was the worst year we 've seen in the decades we 've been compiling statistics on retail sales , and 1981 has been running almost consistently below that . It 's possible it 'll get worse before it gets better . " Beleaguered International Harvester Co .. which currently has about 8,000 production employes laid off , has already taken steps to reduce inventories and could be forced to make more cuts if demand drops further , a spokesman said . A spokesman for Torontobased Massey-Ferguson Ltd. said the company plans to maintain its current production levels through year-end but that " interest rates are very important " to the outlook beyond that .                  @ @ @
