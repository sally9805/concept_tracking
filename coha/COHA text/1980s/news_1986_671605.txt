The regal touch will be supplied by Queen Elizabeth when she begins a private four-day visit on May 22 to the manor farm of Will Farish in Woodford County , where she will rejoin some of her old friends and inspect some of her own horses . A few days later , the Queen ' s son-in-law , Capt . Mark Phillips , will arrive for the annual equestrian trials and will be the guest of the Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitneys , who were the hosts for Princess Margaret at the 100th Kentucky Derby 12 years ago. // Both the Queen and her son-in-law will miss the Derby and the international jockeying for position that it prompts and the waves of celebrities that it brings . But they will still be the reigning stars during a month of high socializing that surrounds and even engulfs the two minutes or so that it takes for the horses to make the Run for the Roses at Churchill Downs. // But the winds of change are rippling across the bluegrass country and its manor farms . The crowned heads of Europe still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making it , too . But Arab and Japanese money has been arriving for several years , along with a new generation of American horse people who are supplanting the landed aristocrats as they die or disperse . And along with the new breed , a new tone and even a new life style are surfacing in the old Kentucky home. // " It ' s a period of great flux , " says Mary Jane Gallaher , the writer and social historian of life in Lexington . " There ' s a breed of new cat on the horizon . We have more ' For Sale ' signs on major farms . The horse market has gone up and down . Two or three bloodlines are thriving , like Northern Dancer . But we ' re shaking a lot of coattail riders . And time and economics are changing the Old Guard. " // Phil Dunn , the caterer for many of the parties and dinners during Derby Week , including the Farishes ' dinners for the Queen , says with some sauce , " With the Arabs coming into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , little old Lexington will never be the same. " // There are two major social scenes in the horse country . One is at Churchill Downs on Derby Day and the day before , when the Kentucky Oaks is run . It usually resembles a costume party for 150 , 000 people , a spectacular mix of celebrities and bluebloods and poseurs . College kids camp outside the grounds all night for a spot in the infield , but some old grads pay $600 for one seat for two days in the Eclipse dining room. // And , in the Skyline boxes upstairs , where the elite meet to eat , you may run into John Galbreath or George Steinbrenner or Wellington Mara and other sporting people as they play host , or you may catch a glimpse of Bob Hope , Stan Musial , Al Hirt , Walter Cronkite and Muhammad Ali . Or , on a new balcony just off the Jockey Club , with awning and patio overlooking the Clubhouse Gardens below , Gov . Martha Layne Collins and her guests will settle in for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 75 miles to the southeast in the bluegrass country surrounding Lexington , and that ' s where the parties thrive for days before and after the mere running of the race. // " The parties are changing , too , " says Mary Jane Gallaher , who is Mrs. Fred Kissling in private life . " Some of the Old Guard still have their traditional parties , but a number of new people have come in , and they seem to be big for entertainment. // " Anita Madden was maybe the first to come up with the ' theme ' party . But now it seems most parties come with themes. // " John and Pauletta Post of Dallas are fairly new to the scene . On Thursday before the Derby , they ' re having a May Day picnic for maybe 300 people on their farm with the theme ' Call to the Post. ' " // Mrs. A. B. Hancock Jr. , the mistress of the Claiborne Farm , the home of Secretariat and many other renowned stallions , remembers that the social whirl was different " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The calendar was more fixed , and the perennial events were de rigueur , such as the Derby Day lunch at Calumet Farm. // " Everything ' s changed now , " she says . " A lot of people who came in and give parties , I don ' t even know now. " // The parties began in earnest last Thursday with the annual Lexington Ball , staged in a huge tent on Spendthrift Farm by Leslie Combs 2d as a charity event. // Tomorrow night : titles and black ties . The Count ( he paints horses ) and Countess de Claviere are hosts of a dinner at their Marfez Farm honoring Princess Maria Pia de Savoie and Prince Michel de Bourbon Parme . On Thursday : the Posts ' picnic and Mary Jane Gallaher ' s traditional soiree for 250 or so at her home in Lexington. // Friday : Andy and Reny Adams ' s breakfast at Coal Ridge Farm . Anita Madden ' s swinging black-tie extravaganza for a couple of thousand guests at the farm . And MaryLou and Sonny Whitney ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their farm . Swank and select . Ginger Rogers will be there , and the Count and Countess Chandon ( champagne ) . The theme : " Out of This World " ( Victorian , we are told . ) The Day After : Governor Collins serves brunch for 100 at her home , Cave Hill . Leslie Combs serves elegant lunch on the patio at Spendthrift . In the evening , small and select : Mary Fisher ( General Motors ) serves dinner at Dixiana Farm. // After that , the coast is clear . That is , until the Queen of England arrives 18 days later. // By then , many of the horse people will have trekked to Baltimore and back for the Preakness , where the good life continues on farms in Maryland and Virginia . The focus is the Preakness Ball , tendered by Mr. and Mrs. Ben Cohen of Pimlico the night before the big race. // Three weeks later , it ' s on to New York . And , if the faces look familiar , they are : Many of the people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they often commute . The main event is the Belmont Ball the night before the Belmont Stakes , and the main movers are Mrs. Virginia Guest , Mrs. John A. Morris and Mrs. Nicholas Brady. // So much for the Triple Crown . Next : Saratoga in August , where MaryLou Whitney gathers the clans and stages her annual ball and parade in fond celebration of the horse , one more time. //
