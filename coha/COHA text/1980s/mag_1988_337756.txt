Oh , no . Not again . Not the H word . All right . Be strong . Face up to it . H-i-t- c-h-c-o-c-k-i-a-n . There . That was n't so bad , was it ? <P> And Frantic is n't so bad either . As a matter of fact , it more nearly matches that critical cliche than most of the other movies on which the term is carelessly slapped . One can easily imagine Old Master Slyboots going for Roman Polanski 's basic premise . <P> Dr. and Mrs. Richard Walker ( Harrison Ford and Betty Buckley ) , innocent , middle-class Americans , arrive jet-lagged and grungy in Paris early one morning , their mood unimproved when the taxi bringing them into the city from the airport develops a flat tire . All they can think about is bed and breakfast before they plunge into the medical convention that he is about to address . Oh , yes , and hot showers . Walker is taking his and trying to hear something his wife is saying over the rush of water when she disappears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exit as he can not , and there is something distinctly odd , bad-dreamy about her movement out of frame and , as it happens , out of the normality that Polanski so nicely states in his film 's early passages . There is something very human about her husband 's  --  everybody 's  --  refusal to admit at first that something unusual must have happened . How desperately we cling to the belief that orderliness is immutable . <P> The hotel people and the police are all Gallic shrugs . Perhaps Madame has a lover ? The American embassy is all bureaucracy . See that line over there , buddy ? Well , go stand in it , and then we 'll listen to your troubles . Walker , whose characterization Ford balances nicely between exasperation and desperation , is all thumbs . He does not speak the language , he never gets to sleep , eat or change his suit , and he keeps stumbling into situations in which he needs all the coordination and smarts that regular habits help to ensure . Hitch at least used to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ties . <P> He also gave them grownup female allies . Poor Richard has to make do with disco-bopping Michele ( Emmanuelle Seigner ) , who is every father figure 's nightmare . She is an amiable girl , but without common sense or discernible attention span . It is she , vaporishly bearing Frantic 's MacGuffin , who mixes up her bag with the Walkers ' luggage at the airport , thus starting off all their troubles . <P> It is also her character that causes the picture 's problems . Polanski and Co-Writer Gerard Brach start by doing too little with her and end by doing too much . They might have exploited the comic possibilities of her dazy nature a little more , especially as the villains grow overtly menacing in their attempts to reclaim their lost luggage . That , though , is a forgivable flaw . The story , too , is busy with other demands that include , refreshingly , a desire to balance the demand for suspense against the need for plausibility . The principals are never tested by situations that require daring or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not forgivable is the end to which Michele is maneuvered . It is a glaring , blaring atonality , the only conceivable purpose of which is to help , Polanski prove that he is not a Hitchcockian after all  --  more serious , do n't you know . But why spoil a perfectly enjoyable , often quite imaginative imitation by insisting on that dubious point ?
