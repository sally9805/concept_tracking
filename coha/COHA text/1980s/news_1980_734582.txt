txt 0-1 am preparing a family history for my grandchildren . When my family moved to Chicago in 1928 , I was in the 4th grade at Bryn Mawr School at Jeffery Boulevard and 73d Street .

Montgomery , Hinsdale A  --  Here 's the picture proving you are correct . The Santa Maria was the last survivor of the three replicas of Columbus ' fleet built by the Spanish government from old prints and descriptions of the original Nina , Pina , and Santa Maria . The three made the trip to this country under escort of the United States cruiser Newark . After a naval review in Hampton Roads , Va. , they were towed to Chicago , arriving in July , 1893 .

After the fair , the tiny ships remained in the Jackson Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nina was destroyed by fire a year later , The Santa Maria was allowed to slowly rot away . Following a fire in 1952 , she was broken up by a wrecking crew and removed . Q  --  We live In a mobile home park , and are questioning the unnecessary pressure we are subjected to each month regarding payment of Commonwealth Edison bills . The bills are sent to one of the owners , but each trailer has an individual meter , and the tenants are ( *chilled . As soon as the owner gets the bills we are expected to pay at least one month in advance of the due ( late Edison designates . The electricity we used from Oct. 31 to Dec. 3 cost $28.50 , and the due dale specified was Jan. 20 , but the trailer park billing states this amount was due on or before Dec. 19 .

The kitchen was supplied by little ma and pa West Side grocery stores after a sales ptich by Al 's musclemen . Kindly At would tip a hat check girl $10 , and would beat an old prostitute for holding out a buck . Capone was noted for trading a bucket of ashes for a bucket of coal any day .
