This is a neighborhood where the nightly newscasts showing violence in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip strike a responsive chord . Many of the viewers are Palestinians who were born in the Israeli-occupied territories and have their own stories to tell. // There is the agony of the Jerusalem-born owner of a grocery store . ' ' Already four people in my family are in jail , ' ' he says . He does not know what they are charged with . ' ' You can go to jail for looking at a soldier , ' ' he says. // // Another store owner tells of his wife ' s humiliation . On a recent visit to see relatives on the West Bank , she was strip-searched by Israeli officials , even though she was traveling on an American passport . ' ' She had to go with the Palestinians and be naked . They took her shoes , ' ' he complains . ' ' Why don ' t they get out , ' ' he yells at a reporter. // Then , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He criticizes Israel for welcoming Jews from all over as citizens without extending the same hospitality to Arabs . ' ' I was born there and I can ' t stay two weeks , ' ' he says . Muhammed Silwadi agrees . A Palestinian who wants to move back to his birthplace , he complains that ' ' Jews from Ethiopia get more rights in my country than I do . My country is Palestine , ' ' he stresses , ' ' not Israel . ' ' Recently , Mr. Silwadi returned for a month when his mother died , but he says he was refused permission to stay. // Because of such personal travails , the Arab-American community here does not have high hopes for Secretary of State George Shultz ' s efforts toward settling the unrest in Israel ' s occupied territories. // This past weekend , in the first gathering of Palestinan-Americans since the current uprising began , 1 , 500 Arab-Americans met in Washington at the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee ' s ( ADC ) national convention . The uprising , in which at least 85 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on Sunday conventioneers demonstrated outside the White House. // But most of the estimated 150 , 000 to 200 , 000 Palestinians living in the United States in such cities as New York , Chicago , Detroit , and San Francisco are enduring the turmoil quietly. // Nabil Abraham , a second-generation Palestinian-American and author of ' ' Arabs in the New World , ' ' says the Palestinian population is less vocal than the American Jewish population , for a number of reasons . ' ' Immigrants are notoriously scared , ' ' he says . They may not be comfortable with the language or they may feel unsure of their status . In some cases , the Palestinians here are not American citizens and do not want to compromise their chances for citizenship . Furthermore , he says , ' ' Palestinians are primitive in their organization. ' ' // Finally , Arabs are sometimes associated with terrorism , Mr. Abraham says , and Arab-Americans often wish to avoid the insecurity and harassment they expect will come of drawing attention to their heritage . Palestinian leaders complain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracts the attention of the FBI. // Last weeks ' s bus hijacking in which three Israeli civilians and the three Palestinian attackers were killed is a reminder to the Arabs of the tenuous nature of public opinion . Faris Bouhafa , an ADC spokesman , says the hijacking might serve to shift public opinion away at precisely the time when Palestinians were gaining sympathy. // ' ' As much as I personally regret anybody getting killed , ' ' says Mr. Bouhafa , ' ' you have to balance ( the deaths of the three Israelis ) with the Palestinians who have all been killed in the last few months . ' ' He notes that when Israeli soldiers kill Palestinians , ' ' it ' s not called a terrorist act . ' ' Bouhafa is quick to defend Palestinian actions , expressing concern for their public image . Yet readers ' letters in all major newspapers and advertisements placed by American Jewish groups indicate a swing toward the Palestinian side of the conflict. // Even so , the Arab-American shopkeepers along Atlantic Avenue in downtown Brooklyn are cautious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests . ' ' Say my name is Z , ' ' another says . They fear that publication of their names may endanger their families living in the occupied territories. // ' ' Nobody in the Israeli government wants peace , ' ' complains the owner of a store crowded with Arabic videotapes , Middle Eastern groceries , and Palestinian flags . A Palestinian who has been in the US for 20 years , he says if peace comes , the Israeli government will no longer enjoy the substantial funding it now receives from the US. // But Sam Moustapha , a Syrian who works in his family ' s Brooklyn grocery store , is more optimistic about Mr. Shultz ' s shuttle diplomacy . ' ' Any effort is welcome to stop the bloodshed , ' ' he says . ' ' The uprising is the only answer right now. ' ' // Standing behind a cash register with the letters PLO scrawled across it , a store owner cites the Dec. 3 closing of the Palestine Information Office in Washington as evidence of the US government ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country , ' ' says a Jerusalem-born Brooklyn store owner . The conflict between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres , he says , is to create the impression that Israel is a democracy with open dispute among leaders . ' ' They ' re very shrewd , ' ' he says. // While he dislikes the Israeli government , the shopkeeper also seems dissatisfied with Yasser Arafat ' s role as leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization . ' ' I wouldn ' t let him run my store , ' ' he says . But he acknowledges that Mr. Arafat has become a rallying symbol for the PLO. // He thinks Shultz is mistaken in looking to Egypt or Jordan as partners in negotiations . ' ' It ' s not in their hands , ' ' he says. // Bouhafa , the ADC spokesman , agrees , saying the United States ' ' continues to mirror Israeli policy ' ' by looking for ' ' surrogates ' ' instead of dealing directly with the PLO . He says the conditions required before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the recognition of the Palestinian right to self-determination , the acceptance of the establishment of a Palestinian state , and the willingness to negotiate with the PLO. ' ' // ' ' When the US decided it was time that we get out of Vietnam , we sat down and talked to the Viet Cong , ' ' says Isa Hassan , a Michigan pharmacist who has been in the US since 1962 . He says the current Israeli situation is a parallel one in which Israel must negotiate with the PLO. // Mr. Hassan is active in an organization of Palestinians who trace their origin to the predominantly Christian town of Ramallah in the West Bank . The group , formed in 1952 , began as a social organization , Hassan says . But since the 1967 occupation of the West Bank , there has been greater emphasis on educating the youth about their ethnic heritage. // Hassan speaks with pride of the time four years ago when he traveled to Tunis to meet Arafat .

A Muslim who divides the world into believers and nonbelievers , he says , ' ' The Muslims will fight the Jews . ' ' He believes both sides would continue to fight if a compromise were arranged , explaining , ' ' There is no solution. ' ' // //
