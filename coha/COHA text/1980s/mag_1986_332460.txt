JAMES HERRIOT 'S DOG STORIES <P> St. Martin 's Press ; 427 pages ; $19.95 <P> " I spent a lifetime treating the ailments of cows , horses , sheep and pigs , yet here I am , in my twilight years , bringing out a volume of my dog stories . " So begins James Herriot 's wholly unnecessary apologia . The Yorkshire vet 's style is unadorned , his message is affectionate , and his four- footed characters are irresistible . Here he has gathered 50 recollections of canines , some of them sentimental , a few tragic and at least one  --  the story of a terrier male who abruptly becomes attractive to other males  --  as odd as anything in the Decameron . Herriot recalls that in his student days domestic animals were customarily listed in descending order of importance : horse , ox , sheep , pig , dog . In the latest work , he has brought his favorites to the front and given them a new leash on life . <P> THE NEWS FROM IRELAND <P> by William Trevor <P> Viking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the past is still very much alive in William Trevor 's latest stories . As in previous collections , such as The Day We Got Drunk on Cake and Lovers of Their Time , national and personal histories cast a haunting twilight over a lonely present . This works particularly well in the title story of The News from Ireland , which is set in the 1840s . That , of course , is the period of the great famine that sent more than 1 million Irish to the New World . It is also the time when a family of English Protestants named Pulvertaft arrives in Ireland to take over the house and estate of a dead relative . The sense of strangeness and dislocation that Trevor evokes in this story can be felt in today 's Anglo-Irish relations . Verity in On the Zattere also feels out of joint . She is a beautiful 38-year-old woman who has accompanied her widowed father on his annual autumn trip to Venice : " Without meaning to , Verity had taken her mother 's place . " People in Trevor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall into the deep sleep of illusion . Nancy Simpson , the ex-chorus girl in Lunch in Winter , muses about her youth while she sits in a hotel bar waiting for the right man to come along : " She could see the stairs , where sooner or later the chap would appear . He 'd buy a drink and then he 'd look around and there she 'd be . " In Music , Justin Condon , a traveling salesman of women 's underwear , sustains himself with the vision of being a romantic composer . Yet these characters do not come across as failures . Trevor makes the yearnings of ordinary people seem as significant as the accomplishments of the exceptional . <P> " AND SO IT GOES " <P> by Linda Ellerbee <P> Putnam ; 255 pages ; $16.95
