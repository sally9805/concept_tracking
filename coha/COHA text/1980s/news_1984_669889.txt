PACKAGED-GOODS COMPANIES have been on a roll the past two years , spewing out brand after brand of chewy cookies , granola bars , hair-styling mousses , wine coolers and low-alcohol beers . But now there are signs that the new product boom is waning . Dancer Fitzgerald Sample Inc. , an advertising agency , says the number of products introduced in June , July , August and September slipped 3% from the same period in 1983 . Although rather slim , the drop is the first detected by Dancer ' s widely followed New Product News survey since the boom began in 1982 . For the first nine months of 1984 , the number of new products is up 7. 3% from last year , but that pales against the 25% gain in the first three quarters of 1983 . " A number of companies shot their wad last year , " says Robert McMath , publisher of a weekly report called Product Alert . " Products like caffeine-free drinks and low-salt foods seem to have run their course for now . " His survey shows an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first three quarters of 1984 , with the biggest declines in household goods , cosmetics , toiletries and food . MARKETING CONSULTANTS BELIEVE some companies are stretching out their product-development schedules because of budgetary pressures . In soaps , toiletries and cosmetics , analysts say , some companies face intense price competition and are struggling to keep expenses down and profits growing . " When budgets get cut , product development is among the first things to go , " says John Luther , president of the Development Agency , a division of Marketing Corp. of America . He senses softening in new product activity among some of his food-processing clients because sales volume is smaller than anticipated . Consumer product companies are also up against growing retailer resistance to new and unproven products . Lately , grocery and drugstore chains have become more finicky about what they stock on their already jammed shelves . " We can ' t bring a new product into our stores without discontinuing an old one , " explains David Herriman , director of grocery purchasing for Giant Food Inc . " But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been buying that old product . " Of 44 new items on the agenda at a recent purchasing meeting , Giant accepted only four . Another possible constraint on product introductions is the recent flurry of food-industry mergers , such as the proposed Carnation-Nestle combination . Such activity diverts management attention and can slow the rate of new product approvals , says Martin Friedman , editor of New Product News . THE CONSUMER PRODUCT GIANTS are keeping their product introduction plans close to their vests . Most deny they are delaying product entries . For example , consultants say General Foods Corp. is easing up , but Donald Keller , an executive vice president , claims : " We ' re on a streak of success with new products like Crystal Light and Sugar Free Kool-Aid drink mixes . We ' re not slowing down either in our intentions or our funding . " Some companies inflate their new product tallies a bit , making it hard to track trends . Del Monte Corp. brags that it has brought out a whopping 44 products this year . Twenty-nine are varieties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are three flavors of a tropical fruit juice that come in three forms of packaging . Some people might count all those as two new products . Gillette Co. is apparently cutting back on new products following some recent flops . Both analysts and competitors say the company is putting more funds behind older brands because of such disappointments as Silkience moisturizer . Says a marketing consultant : " Moving a hair-care product like Silkience into skin care tended to confuse consumers and dilute the impact of the name . " Financial limitations , not any dearth of good ideas , seem to be the only obstacle at some companies . " We ' ve got new products lined up like planes at O ' Hare waiting to take off , " says Herbert Baum , vice president , marketing , at Campbell Soup Co . " But it takes a lot of money to bring them all to market . " Procter &; Gamble Co. says it will keep pumping out new products as aggressively as it did in 1983 and 1984 . But P &; watchers aren ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Citrus Hill orange juice , Duncan Hines cookies and Always sanitary pads . THE TREND , some marketing experts believe , is toward more new products that aren ' t really very new at all . Companies must keep churning out products in the fight for a bigger share of slow-growing consumer markets , but many products are nothing more than variations on old brands . General Foods , for instance , is testing ready-to-drink versions of Kool-Aid and Tang , while Nabisco Brands Inc. is banking on Planters Lite Peanuts and a blueberry style of Fig Newtons . On a recent shopping spree through New York state , New Jersey and Pennsylvania , Mr. McMath spent $800 filling his car trunk with new products . But unlike last year , the publisher of Product Alert says he didn ' t find any he could honestly call innovative . " It ' s easier and cheaper to put out flanker brands than totally new brands , " says Hercules Segalas , an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . He estimates that P &; will spend about $25 million on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tide laundry detergent , which is being test-marketed now . On the other hand , he figures , it would cost Lever Brothers $75 million to $100 million to do the same with its new Surf detergent .
