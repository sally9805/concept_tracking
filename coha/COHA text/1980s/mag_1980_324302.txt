THE OAK AND THE CALF by Alexander Solzhenitsyn Translated by Harry Willetts ; Harper &; Row ; 568 pages ; $15.95 <P> Novelist , short-story writer , playwright , poet , historian of the Gulag and indefatigable polemicist-these are the various vocations that Alexander Solzhenitsyn has long pursued . Now , with the publication of The Oak and the Calf , yet another Solzhenitsyn has emerged : military strategist . This memoir reveals the embattled Russian writer as the master planner of his own personal twelve-year war with the Soviet regime . Few readers of his chronicle of combat will fail to be impressed by the bold forays and feints , the diversionary actions and tactical retreats that ultimately won Solzhenitsyn an unconditional victory , albeit only a moral one . <P> The extended military metaphor is Solzhenitsyn 's own . Scarcely any other image is large enough to encompass the feat of a writer who consistently outwitted and outmaneuvered Nikita Khrushchev , the KGB and the Soviet literary establishment in the pursuit of his mission : to bear witness to the Gulag before his countrymen and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his greatest productivity and fame , beginning in 1962 with the publication of his concentration camp novel One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich on Khrushchev 's orders , and ending with his deportation from the Soviet Union in 1974 . Solzhenitsyn , whose creative energies seem to flourish in adversity , was in top form when he wrote The Oak during the years 1967-73 ; only the climactic chapter , footnotes and appendixes have been added in exile . The force of his narrative , the drama of unfolding historical events and the density of supporting detail combine to make The Oak one of the author 's most engrossing books . <P> Few men ever set out on the warpath with less visible weaponry than Solzhenitsyn . Imprisoned in the Gulag from 1945 to 1953 , he was one of the 5 million prisoners released from the camps during the three years following Stalin 's death in 1953 . In 1961 he was teaching school in a provincial Soviet town , living in obscurity , indeed in oblivion . His existence as a writer literally lay underground . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried two novels , One Day and The First Circle , two plays , a movie scenario and 12,000 lines of verse . All had been typed , single-spaced , on both sides of onionskin paper for easier concealment . These fragile manuscripts were what Solzhenitsyn called his " divisions " and " army corps " that would soon lay siege to the Kremlin . <P> <P> He sensed his opportunity in Khrushchev 's second , resounding de-Stalinization speech in 1961 . Unearthing One Day and departing for Moscow , he embarked on a series of masterly intrigues designed to interest Khrushchev in publishing his harrowing tale of the Stalinist camps . Exactly one year later his scheme succeeded ; ultimately , the novel was published in editions totaling 921,000 copies , encouraging many Soviet citizens to expect and even to demand punishment of officials still in power who had shared in Stalin 's crimes .
