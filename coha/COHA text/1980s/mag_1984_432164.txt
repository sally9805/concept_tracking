 | A fascinating report on the glittering gems the young princess now owns-and how she got them If diamonds are a girl 's best friend , then Princess Diana will someday be the most befriended of women ? and the most bejeweled . For when her husband , the Prince of Wales , succeeds to the throne of England , Diana , as Queen Consort , will come into possession of what is undoubtedly the most spectacular collection of jewels in the world today . The glittery assortment of tiaras , necklaces , bracelets , and brooches set with priceless diamonds. , emeralds , sapphires , and rubies , which will be  | hers to wear whenever she pleases , will take the princess a long way from the little gold letter D on a slim gold chain and the simple pearl necklace and earrings that were her only adornments when Prince Charles first came courting . But when the engagement of the assistant kindergarten teacher to the future king was announced , things changed quickly . First Prince Charles gave her the much photographed sapphire ring framed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , loaned her suitable gems for her earliest official photographs . In the engagement photos you see Prince Charles resplendent in his naval uniform and Diana radiant in a green taffeta dress and bedecked with bor-  | rowed emerald earrings and necklace from Collingwoods . One of Diana 's first gifts from Prince Charles was an inch-wide diamond pendant in the shape of three feathers , the coat of arms of the Prince of Wales . At first she wore this charming piece hanging from a little velvet ribbon around her neck . The velvet ribbon changed colors to match her outfits . But soon she had a more suitable necklace for her pendant . The crown prince of Saudi Arabia sent her a truly princely engagement gift : a diamond necklace with a magnificent ( removable ) sapphire-and-diamond pendant and matching sapphire-and-diamond earrings and bracelet . The set was made in France and reported to be insured for about one million dollars . On occasion the princess was photographed wearing the diamond necklace with a different pendant ? the diamond feather one from Charles . F or her wedding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a diamond headdress with a very becoming scalloped edge . A family tiara is usually reserved for the eldest daughter , but since Diana needs a tiara far more often than her two older sisters , Sarah and Jane , the Spencer tiara has for the moment become hers . The wedding band that Prince Charles slipped onto her finger is made of Welsh gold , carved from a large gold nugget mined in Wales . Gold from the same nugget has been used to make royal wedding bands ever since Queen Elizabeth ( now the Queen Mother ) married King George VI in 1923 . After the ceremony , as she left for her honeymoon , Diana wore for the first time a magnificent six-strand pearl choker , a gift from her family . Her sister Jane had worn the same strands of pearls to the wedding . After the honeymoon the queen gave her daughter-in-law a diamond-andpearl tiara that had belonged to Queen Mary , the queen 's grandmother . Then as the weeks passed the princess began to emerge from luncheon visits with Queen Elizabeth with wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from her vast supply of jewels , has constantly been passing along many delightful small pieces ? pins , bracelets , decorative boxes , enchanting Fabergd enamels . Many of these items have lain hidden away in jewel boxes since Queen Mary 's death more than 30 years ago . The queen can easily spare these minor baubles , since she owns the most extensive and valuable private collection of jewels in the world . But before I describe the queen 's jewelry , I must explain that there are two distinctly different collections of jewelry connected with the royal family . First there are the Crown Jewels of England , the majestic display in the Jewel Room in the Tower of London that is visited by more than a million people every year . Back in 1974 these jewels were estimated to be worth 74 million dollars . The British Crown Jewels belong to the state , not to the reigning king or queen . The Crown Jewels are chiefly the regalia used in coronations : crowns , scepters , staffs , swords , orbs , bracelets , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous dia " Well , dear , be good . " 228 monds and oversized precious stones . The most ancient piece of all , the silvergilt anointing spoon used to anoint the sovereign , is said to date back to the twelfth century . When Prince Charles becomes king , he will be crowned in Westminster Abbey with St. Edward 's crown , made for King Charles II in 1661 and used in nearly every coronation since then . It contains about 440 precious and semiprecious stones and weighs nearly five pounds . The jeweled crown surmounts a cap of royal-purple velvet edged in ermine . At the coronation ceremony 's closing and at state occasions such as the opening of Parliament the reigning monarch wears an even more splendid headpiece ? the Imperial State Crown It was made in 1838 for Queen Victoria and contains a historic ruby ( so huge it is known as the " rock ruby " ) plus a 317-carat square diamond ? which was cut from the legendary Cullinan diamond ? dozens of other extraordinary stones , and more than 3,000 smaller diamonds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first turn at wearing the Crown Jewels . She may have a special crown made for the occasion , but that is not too likely in this budget-conscious era . It is more probable that she will wear one of the crowns on display in the Tower . She may choose the graceful crown made for Queen Elizabeth , the Queen Mother , when she became Queen Consort of King George VI in 1937 . Its main feature is the famous 108-carat Koh-inoor diamond , which is said to have belonged to the Indian queen in whose memory the Taj Mahal was built . The Koh-i-noor has reputedly brought calamity and violent death to all the men who have worn it . But ever since it was presented to Queen Victoria it has beer worn only by women who fortunately seem immune to its curse . Another possible choice for Diana is the crown known as Queen Mary 's , set entirely with diamonds and crystals and made for Queen Mary when she was crowned Queen Consort with King George V in 1911 . This crown contains a 95-carat pear-shaped diamond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabulous Cullinan , which originally weighed in at 3,106 carats ? the largest diamond ever discovered . The diamond was a gift from the government of South Africa to Edward VII , Queen Victoria 's son . The interesting aspect of these two diamonds in the Queen Mary crown , known as the Lesser Stars of Africa , is that they are now the personal property of Queen Elizabeth and are mounted into Queen Mary 's crown in such a way that they can be separated and worn independently as a pendant or brooch . That brings us to the second collection of royal jewels . These are the per-  | sonal possessions of the monarch and of members of the royal family . They are owned outright and can be given or bequeathed as the owner chooses . These are the incredible jewels that Princess Diana can look forward to owning at some future time . Many of them date back to Queen Mary , the Consort of George V , that most queenly looking woman famous for her regal bearing and her pompadour of silvery hair . King George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throne during World War I. George 's mother , the Queen Mother Alexandra , widow of King Edward VII , was a Danish princess whose sister was the dowager empress of Russia , mother of the reigning tsar . At the time of the Russian revolution and the murder of the tsar 's family , the dowager empress managed to escape to Denmark , taking with her a fabulous collection of Russian jewels . These jewels were later purchased by King George V and the money put into a fund to support his mother 's Russian relatives who came to live at Hampton Court near London . So it was that Queen Mary owned both the marvelous Russian jewels as well as the jewels she inherited from her husband 's grandmother , Queen Victoria , and from his mother , Queen Alexandra . We now come to a mysterious chapter in the history of the personally owned royal jewels . When Edward , Prince of Wales , came briefly to the throne in 1936 as King Edward VIII and then abdicated to marry Wallis Simpson , his mother , Queen Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of jewels . Otherwise , they might well have all been given by Edward VIII ( he later became Duke of Windsor ) to his American wife and they might have passed out of the royal family . As it was , the Duchess of Windsor did receive many lavish gifts of royal jewels from her husband , jewels that had been set aside for the wife of the Prince of Wales , and the mystery now is what will become of these jewels after her death . For years Lord Mountbatten stayed in close touch with the Duchess of Windsor and was charged with negotiating the return of the royal jewels . But his mission was incomplete when he was killed by the IRA in 1979 . The Duchess of Windsor was always very fond of Prince Charles . He used to call on her for tea when he visited Paris , and she sent him a telegram when he became engaged . Now the duchess is ill and living in seclusion in Paris and the fate of her jewels is up in the air . What jewels does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they be returned to her late husband 's family ? Will Diana inherit them ? No one knows . Meantime there will be no shortage of gems for Diana . The Queen Mother , who owns , among dozens of pieces , a spectacular tiara with diamonds shaped into elongated hexagons , a ruby-anddiamond tiara , a necklace that literally drips diamonds and pearls , and a stunning ruby-and-diamond necklace with matching bracelet and earrings , may give or leave some of her jewels to her younger daughter , Princess Margaret ; to her granddaughter , Princess Anne : : to Princess Margaret 's daughter , Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones ; and to the future wives of Prince Andrew and Prince Edward . But the main collection will undoubtedly go to Diana . And that is only the beginning . For it is Queen Elizabeth II 's personal collection of jewels , worth a queen 's ransom many times over , that will drape Diana in jewels beyond any woman 's imaginings . The queen owns 20 tiaras but wears only three of them with any regularity . One of her favorites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fringe of particularly brilliant diamonds that was made from the Russian jewels for Queen Alexandra , Consort of King Edward VII , for her silver wedding anniversary in 1888 . Another frequently worn tiara is known as Granny 's Tiara , since it was owned by the queen 's grandmother , Queen Mary . It is designed in a fleur-de-lis pattern of diamonds topped with larger diamonds . The tiara was given added height when Queen Elizabeth had it mounted on a narrow diamond band . The other tiara she favors ? also a gift from her grandmother ? is known as the Interchangeable Tiara because its interlocking circles of diamonds can be hung with either large pearl drops ( which she prefers ) or with cabochon emeralds , depending on the queen 's mood or her outfit . The queen also owns a magnificent tiara set with rubies that she wears only rarely , another tiara surmounted with diamond-paved Maltese crosses , one that comes apart to form a necklace , and more than a dozen others that she hardly ever takes out of the vault for herself but lends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is almost always worn at evening affairs that call for a long gown . The queen 's necklaces are every bit as fabulous as her tiaras . One that she wears frequently is the elaborate Jubilee necklace of diamonds and pearls , made by Garrards , the royal jewelers , for Queen Victoria 's Golden Jubilee in 1887 . Another is a necklace-and-earrings set of incredible emeralds , a gift from the people of Brazil to Queen Elizabeth II on her coronation . For her twenty-first birthday the queen , then still a princess , was given a triple strand of diamonds by the government of South Africa . She had the necklace shortened and the extra stones made into a bracelet . Now when the queen says , " I 'll wear my best diamonds , " she means the triple strand from South Africa . Still another necklace is of emeralds and diamonds with two uneven drops , one ending with a huge cabochon emerald , the other with part of the Cullinan diamond that also helps light up Queen Mary 's crown . The queen 's collection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she wears with both day and evening clothes , seems almost endless . One is in the shape of a large diamond bowknot , another is a smaller bowknot . She also has an enormous sapphire encircled by diamonds , a starburst of gold and diamonds , a diamond rose . and a diamond pin with a huge pearl drop . The queen is not too interested in rings , yet one she wears ? her diamond solitaire engagement ring ? often gives a clue to her mood . When she becomes impatient , she begins to finger the ring . which used to belong to Prince Philip 's mother , Princess Alice of Greece . Queen Elizabeth 's wedding ring is cut from the same chunk of Welsh gold as Diana 's . A 11 these tiaras , necklaces , bracelets , and brooches , along with dozens of lesser pieces , are worn constantly in rotation by the queen . Soon after I went to work at Buckingham Palace in 1966 , I got my first glimpse of the queen in full evening dress , glittering with diamonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child 's fair tale . It was hard to believe that those dazzling stones , some the size of small eggs , could possibly be real . But all the magnificence seemed appropriate in Buckingham Palace . Imagine my surprise when in August 1966 the royal family went to spend a month at Balmoral Castle in Scotland . Balmoral is in the country where most people take it easy and wear casual clothes . But not the royals . Of course they wear tweeds during the day . But they dress for dinner every night , the queen wearing evening dresses that she had worn at previous appearances in London and abroad . And the glorious jewels travel with her wherever she goes , whether to Balmoral , Windsor , or anywhere else on the globe . At home the jewels are kept in spe-  | cially made boxes ? the tiaras mounted on little springs to cushion their weight ? and the boxes are stored in a big walk-in safe in Buckingham Palace . When the queen travels , one of her two footmen never lets go of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow label that says simply THE QUEEN . Her three dressers are responsible for coordinating her outfits and jewels and rotating them in proper order . In addition to everything she will inherit , Princess Diana can also look forward to sumptuous gifts that are traditionally given to heads of state when they travel . On the queen 's tour to the Middle East in 1979 , for example , she was welcomed with jewels that immediately became part of her personal collection . These gifts are usually worn when the queen returns to the country that presented them or when an official of that country visits England . The queen , in turn , usually gives foreign dignitaries a rather modest engraved silver tray . Also available for Diana to wear will be some 50 or 60 Foreign Orders in the form of diamond-and-jeweled pins that are kept in glass cases at Windsor Castle . They are usually worn on ceremonial occasions on a wide ribbon or sash draped diagonally across the chest . Then when she visits the various regiments , such as the Scots , Irish , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in enamel and precious stones . And finally there are Family Orders , started by King George IV in 1820 . These are oval cameos of the reigning sovereign , hand-painted on ivory and surrounded by diamonds . They are pinned to a fringed taffeta ribbon and worn by royal ladies at dressy occasions when tiaras are in order . Diana received her Family Order miniature of Queen Elizabeth right after her marriage to Prince Charles . When her son was born in June 1982 , the prince gave Diana a gold neck wire with a gold disk inscribed with the name William in the prince 's own handwriting . For Christmas 1982 he gave her a diamond-and-emerald bracelet in the Art Deco style . The princess has already had some of the older pieces the queen has given her redesigned and mounted into more modern settings . But the centerpiece of her collection right now , and probably for some time to come , is the sapphire-and-diamond set from Saudi Arabia . The day that magnificent gift arrived during the engagement period when Diana was living at Buckingham Palace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She opened the box , looked at the dazzling jewels with big , startled eyes , and said , " Gosh , I guess I 'm a wealthy lady now . " But not anywhere near as wealthy as the lovely and lucky young lady is going to be some day . . . some day .
