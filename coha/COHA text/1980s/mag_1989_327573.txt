Not even halftime will provide a respite this year from Super Bowl hype . The mid-game spectacle  --  featuring fireworks , 100 motorcycles and the world 's largest card trick  --  will be telecast , for the first time ever , in 3-D . Two commercials for diet Coke , one starring British singer George Michael , will also pop out at viewers in 3-D . A similar gimmick was tried early this month on three Fox stations during the Rose Parade , but this marks its network-TV debut . <P> Through retailers , Coca-Cola is distributing 20 million pairs of cardboard glasses for the event . But unspectacled viewers will not see a blurry image , as they did with the ' 50s technology , used in movies like House of Wax . A new process , Nuoptix 3D , uses regular cameras and delivers a normal picture . The illusion of depth is created by different-color lenses in the glasses , which transmit the image 16 milliseconds slower to the right eye than to the left . One catch : to get the 3-D effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So even if the game slows to a crawl , the halftime action will be fast and furious .
