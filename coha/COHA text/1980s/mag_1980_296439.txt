At the U.N . the Third World rises up against a false friend <P> The climax was almost preordained , and yet it came with surprising speed . After four days of debate had passed and 74 delegates had followed each other to the speaker 's podium of the United Nations General Assembly , it was now time to vote . The Assembly 's Tanzanian president , Salim Ahmed Salim , invited the 152 delegations to record their votes on two electronic boards behind the rostrum . The boards suddenly lit up as the delegates pushed the buttons at their desks-green for yes , red for no , amber for abstention . After just three minutes , Salim coolly revealed the outcome : 104 votes in favor , 18 against , 18 abstentions . " The draft resolution is therefore adopted , " he declared . <P> In the crowded chamber that had witnessed such historic events as Soviet shoe banging and papal appeals for peace , there was no perceptible change in the low buzz of conversation . But everyone there knew that the Soviet Union had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it had professed to champion . It was Moscow 's most spectacular diplomatic humiliation since the U.N . condemnation of the invasion of Hungary in 1956 . <P> Though the Soviet Union was not mentioned by name , the resolution just passed by a lopsided vote of more than 5 to 1 was an outright condemnation of Moscow 's invasion of Afghanistan . The " armed intervention , " it said , was " inconsistent " with the U.N . principle of the " sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of every state . " It thus demanded " the immediate , unconditional and total withdrawal of the foreign troops from Afghanistan " and called on U.N . members and international relief organizations to help all Afghan refugees . The last of the resolution 's eight points required the Security Council to " consider ways and means " to help enforce the resolution . <P> For Oleg Troyanovsky , 60 , Moscow 's representative at the U.N . since 1976 and only the seventh Soviet ambassador there in 35 years , the vote was a galling blow . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet veto to an almost identically worded resolution during a 13 to 2 vote in the Security Council . Only a day before the Afghan resolution , in fact , Troyanovsky had used another veto-the Soviet Union 's 114th-to stave off an otherwise successful U.S. drive to impose U.N . sanctions on Iran . <P> For Americans , it was refreshing to hear Third World countries denounce Moscow with the vehemence they usually reserve for attacks on the " imperialism " of the West . Said Singapore 's highly respected U.N . ambassador , T.T.B. <P> <P> Koh : " The fight over Afghanistan was led by small countries from the Third World who had the courage to get together and take risks . We were able to convince our colleagues not to accept the Soviet version of history . "
