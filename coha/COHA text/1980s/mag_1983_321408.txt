Last summer , after the U.S. movie industry had begun its rebound from a 214-year slump to record the biggest box-office grosses in its history , the story was front-page news and real tinsel was flying from every flagpole in Bel Air . This summer the lines outside movie theaters are even longer , but nobody seems to be shouting . The industry appears so robust that its latest gains are almost unremarkable . According to Variety , ticket sales were up 10.5% for the month of July , and about 9% for the year so far , over comparable 1982 figures . <P> The financial contours of summer ' 83 are similar to those of ' 82 : one super-smash ( Return of the Jedi ) from the mega-hit monopoly of Spielberg-Lucas ( the six top alltime grossers , including last year 's E.T. : The Extra-Terrestrial , were either produced or directed by Steven Spielberg or George Lucas ) ; one surprise hit from early spring that gained momentum by the summer ( Porky 's in 1982 , Flashdance this year ) ; and the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week , seven 1983 films had earned more than $50 million : Jedi ( $216.9 million ) , Flashdance ( $74 million ) , Trading Places ( $72.9 million ) , WarGames ( $61.8 million ) , Superman III ( $61. 5 million ) , Octopussy ( $59.6 million ) and Staying Alive ( $50.9 million ) . <P> A pair of comedies dominate the late-summer box office . National Lampoon 's Vacation is a lame , hard-to-sit-through farce starring Chevy Chase as a food-additives specialist who takes his ' 50s sitcom family on a calamitous cross-country car trip . The other hit , Paul Brickman 's Risky Business , is yet another entry in the lamentable tits-and-zits genre of teen-age sex comedies : a young man finds love and success by becoming a pimp . Still , this film is deftly made , the humor nicely understated , the leading actors ( Tom Cruise and Rebecca de Mornay ) smart and appealing . Risky Business has eyes to emulate Flashdance as a sleeper smash . If it does , that will be news .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
