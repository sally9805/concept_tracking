After months of wrangling , the Social Democratic Party dismembered itself last week . At the University of Sheffield in central England , party delegates voted 273 to 28 to merge with the nearly twice as large Liberal Party . The two centrist groups had been partners under the Alliance banner since 1981 , and began talking merger when their candidates won only 22 of 650 seats in last year 's parliamentary elections . But while their formal marriage was intended to strengthen future showings , it sealed a bitter divorce between the Social Democrats and former Leader David Owen , who co-founded the party in 1981 . Arguing that the Social Democrats would be swallowed up by the Liberals , Owen bolted with a clutch of followers to form a new party , the Campaign for Social Democracy . <P> Emotions ran so high before the vote that Owen 's backers refused to sleep in the same hotel as the promerger forces . Social Democratic President Shirley Williams angrily accused Owen , a former Labor Foreign Minister , of " acting with impetuosity at the moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be losers " if the proposed union did not pass . " Mergerites " tried to block a rally that Owen had called to launch his group , but they backed down after both sides assembled legal teams . <P> The vote delighted members of the Liberal Party , which approved the merger three weeks ago . Liberal Party Leader David Steel said the wide margin of approval " means that both parties can go forward together not just with confidence but with enthusiasm . " Robert Maclennan , who succeeded Owen as head of the Social Democrats , declared that the newly formed party " has a great opportunity to take British politics out of the straitjacket of Conservative dominance . " <P> Britain 's political lineup will now pit the newly created Social and Liberal Democrats and Owen 's breakaway party against the leftist Laborites and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 's Conservatives . Though the new parties hope to weaken the Conservatives ' mandate , they could have precisely the opposite effect . By dividing an already weak opposition even further , they just might give Maggie Thatcher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the century .
