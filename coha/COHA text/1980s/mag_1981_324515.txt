Taking over the Times , Murdoch tries to soothe ruffled Britons <P> For weeks members of the British Establishment had been squawking like chickens with a fox in their coop . The fox , of course , was Rupert Murdoch , the high-rolling Australian press lord , best known for his torrid tabloids . His purchase of the ailing Times of London ( circ. 279,000 ) raised fears that he would vulgarize the staid 196-year-old newspaper with sex and sensation . But last week the din subsided . The reason : Murdoch , 49 , named Sunday Times Editor Harold Evans to the top job at the venerable daily . Evans , 52 , an esteemed journalist and a passionate campaigner for press freedom , is also tough-an important quality to have when dealing with Murdoch . Says London Guardian Editor Peter Preston : " Evans has as good a chance as anybody to make a success of the job . " <P> The Manchester-born son of a locomotive engineer , Evans won high marks for his 14-year stewardship of the Sunday paper , * which he enlivened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scandal in 1972 and 1977 , a series on brutal prison conditions in Ulster in 1972 ) . Unlike its daily counterpart , the Sunday Times ( circ. 1.4 million ) was usually in the black . <P> Though Murdoch promised Evans editorial control at the Times , his Fleet Street colleagues are skeptical . Said Sunday Observer Editor Conor Cruise O'Brien a few days before the appointment : " Mr.Murdoch 's track record shows that he expects and gets uncritical subservience from the newspapers he owns .

" <P> Together the Times , the Sunday Times and three supplements ( Literary , Educational and Higher Education ) have lost some $150 million since 1967 , $32 million in 1980 alone . Much of that red ink was caused by the Times Newspapers print unions , which are notorious for featherbedding and work disruptions ; their unruly behavior and opposition to laborsaving new technology finally drove out the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also owns the London Sun ( circ. 3.7 million ) , News of the World ( circ. 4.2 million ) and New York Post ( circ. 640,000 ) , picked up the five Times publications at the bargain-basement price of $27.6 million ( less than the current value of the plant and equipment alone ) . New union agreements were a condition of the sale , and Murdoch agreed to pay dismissed staffers up to $14 million . Said he : " People seem to think they 're doing me a favor allowing me to buy something which is losing 13 million a year . It will be very difficult to make it viable . "
