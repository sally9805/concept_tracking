For many regions , a rainy spring spawns a summer of mosquitoes <P> In addition to floods , mudslides and other natural havoc , this year 's wet weather has had some less publicized if irritating consequences . Their ranks swollen by record springtime rains , mosquitoes are attacking in force in many parts of the country , feasting on their human prey with buzzing fury . To Gary Benzon , mosquito-control superintendent for Plymouth County , Mass. , south of Boston , there is no doubt that this will be a bumper summer for the pesky insects . " In an average year we get about a thousand calls about mosquito problems between May and September . This year we have already got close to 2,000 . " <P> As entomologists acknowledge , no one can get an accurate scientific count of mosquito populations . Nor does the plague seem to be universal . In Illinois and Indiana , wasps and bees are beginning to appear in large numbers , but residents in those states , as well as in some Mid-Atlantic areas , are enjoying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California and sections of the South , however , heavy rains have left pools of standing water in which the larvae of mosquitoes have flourished . Entomologist Jon Turmel of the Vermont department of agriculture cites a simple personal test . He rolls up a sleeve and lets the mosquitoes bite . Usually , he gets about 20 bites a minute . This year the bite rate has zoomed to about 35 a minute . <P> Mosquitoes can be more than just a nuisance . While there has been no noticeable rise in mosquito-borne diseases so far , the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta is worried about the possibility of a rash of encephalitis in the South later this summer . The last major outbreak ( 2,000 cases ) occurred in 1975 when there were similar climatic conditions : a mild winter followed by heavy spring rains . <P> In some New England , Southern and California communities , planes and spray trucks are now dousing large areas with malathion ( which has largely replaced banned DDT ) . But many scientists are skeptical about the chemical 's effectiveness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zappers . The main impact , says Entomologist John Edman of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst , is psychological : " It reassures people something is being done . " <P> Scientists are also using other techniques . In California , larvae-eating minnows are regularly placed in mosquito-breeding ponds . In New Orleans , U.S. Agriculture Department researchers along with local experts have been releasing a large nonbiting mosquito nicknamed Big Tox ( after its scientific name , Toxorhynchites ambionensis ) , whose larvae dine on the larvae of smaller biting mosquitoes . Scientists have also had success with bacterial warfare : applying a larvae-killing toxin from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis ( which was discovered in Israel ) . But BTI is expensive , must be applied directly to a breeding site , and could encourage proliferation of BTi-resistant mosquitoes . <P> Is there then any hope of victory in the age-old battle against mosquitoes ? Probably not , most scientists agree . If the biting really gets bad , the only recourse is to retreat , swatter in hand behind a fine-meshed screen door .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
