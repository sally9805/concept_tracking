Brickbats for New Federalism <P> Ronald Reagan 's vision of his New Federalism had sounded almost idyllic . He would cut the nation 's states and cities loose from the oppressive purse strings of the Federal Government , leaving them with fewer federal dollars but more freedom to decide how they would be spent , and he would lower the burden of all taxpayers at the same time . Thus it came as quite a jolt to the President last week when some of the beneficiaries of this new freedom protested loudly that the President 's plan was hastily conceived , harshly implemented and downright unworkable . The chorus of protests rose at a Detroit conference of the National League of Cities , an assembly of 2,500 local officials , many from the medium-sized communities where grass-roots support for Reagan policies is supposed to run high . <P> " We must say to the President that the dream is going sour , " declared Minnesota Republican Senator David Durenberger , one of several guest speakers . " The tax cut has made it more difficult to finance state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federalism-conducted in the frenzy of the budget process-will discredit the concept entirely . " <P> A number of speakers argued that Reagan 's across-the-board cuts in federal programs fail to distinguish between those that are ineffective and those that work well to meet the minimal needs of the poor . Republican Mayor William Hudnut of Indianapolis endorsed the trend toward decentralization of government , but warned : " You can not dismiss the poor . It 's like saying ' Let them eat cake ' when they do n't even have bread . " Protested Cleveland 's Republican Mayor George Voinovich : " If you 're going to cut programs it should be done with a scalpel and not a meat ax . . . Otherwise , we 're in the strange position where a single national purpose is supposed to be pursued in 50 different ways with 50 different degrees of enthusiasm . " <P> One of the most carefully reasoned dissections of the New Federalism came from Vermont 's Republican Governor Richard Snelling , chairman of the National Governors ' Association . While the U.S. should not return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had characterized federal-state relations in the 1970s , Snelling said , neither should " our sacred union of states become a confederation of competitors in which only the footloose can flourish . " He assailed Reagan 's contention that a person who does not like governmental programs in one state should " vote with his feet " by moving to another . He also criticized the President 's argument that using federal funds to aid particularly poor localities was a breach of the Constitution . Any reading of the Federalist Papers , said Snelling , shows that the founding fathers knew that " promoting the general welfare would require the Congress of the U.S. to take actions beyond those required to provide for defense . " The President 's policies , he charged , were leading toward " an economic Bay of Pigs . "
