 | In 1884 at the age of five , a boy considered " backward " by his mother and father was mesmerized by the sight of an ordinary compass . No matter which way he turned the instrument , its needle pointed unvaryingly in the same direction , as if held by some magical force . It was the very first time , he wrote some time later , that he had been aware that " something deeply hidden had to be behind things . " The child was Albert Einstein , and the magical , hidden force was magnetism , a force he spent his whole life trying to fathom . In 1905 , Einstein listed the puzzle of Earth 's magnetic field as one of the five most important unsolved mysteries in physics . How was the field generated ? Why did Earth have one in the first place ? Just one year later , the mystery deepened dramatically when Bernard Brunhes , a French physicist and meteorologist , made a startling discovery : Some time in the past , the field had flipped . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a south pole . Today geophysicists know that such geomagnetic reversals have taken place some 300 times in the last 170 million years . They start with a sudden drop of the field intensity toward zero , where it remains for an extended period . Then , after 10,000 years or so , it builds back up to its original value ? but in the opposite direction . Until recently , there was no satisfactory explanation for the bizarre flip-flops . Now there is an extraordinary and controversial theory that provides a mechanism to account not only for the reversals themselves , but also for the not-so-coincidental mass extinctions of life on Earth . The proposed cause of both : regular , titanic collisions between Earth and massive asteroids or comets . According to the theorists , Richard Muller and Donald Morris of the University of California , Berkeley , evidence in support of their ideas can be read in the record of the rocks . It was in rocks that man first became aware of the phenomenon of magnetism . Millennia ago , the ancients observed that bits of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? could attract iron objects . The substance eventually came to be called lodestone , which meant " leading stone " in the language of the Norsemen . They had found it to be useful for navigation because a piece of it freely suspended would always orient itself roughly along a north-south axis . That convenient bit of knowledge was known to the Chinese , perhaps as early as 2700 B.C. By the second century B.C. , the Chinese had drawn the connection between the behavior of magnetic compasses and Earth 's own magnetism . The connection was not clarified in the West until 1600 , when William Gilbert of Colchester , personal physician to Queen Elizabeth I , published a seminal book , De Magnete . He summarized everything that was then known on the subject and declared that compasses worked because Earth behaved like a giant bar magnet . Such a magnet produces a field with a north pole and a south pole ( today called a dipole field ) . It did not take long for scientists to realize that the magnetism found in rocks could be related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitute a record of it . Robert Boyle was possibly the first , in 1691 , to suggest that solid materials that had been heated to a high temperature could become magnetized by Earth 's field when they cooled . The phenomenon is called thermoremanent magnetism and is most prominent in rocks of volcanic origin . When such rocks are molten , in the form of lava , their temperature is generally more than about 1,000 degrees C. That is much higher than the Curie temperature ( named after Pierre , not Marie ) , the point above which magnetic minerals lose their magnetic characteristics . ( The Curie temperature for magnetite is about 575 degrees C ; for hematite , about 675 . ) But when lava cools and solidifies on Earth 's surface , the magnetic minerals @# @#  | are strongly magnetized in the direction of Earth 's field . They retain this magnetism , which serves as a permanent record of the orientation and intensity of Earth 's field in the place and at the time they solidified . And because the age of rocks can now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frozen magnetic memory provides a record of any changes in the ancient magnetic field . So examination of this record of the rocks can elucidate much about Earth 's history . By the mid-19th century , such studies of paleomagnetism had become very lively . Enter Bernard Brunhes . Born in Toulouse , France , into a family of savants , Brunhes had begun in 1901 to sample rocks from different places and ages and study their magnetism . Because he knew that volcanic rocks were the most promising , he traveled to the region of France called the Auvergne : poor , sparsely populated , and dotted with the scattered domes of ancient , extinct volcanoes . In 1906 , Brunhes brought back to Paris a number of samples he had taken from Auvergnat lava flows and the baked clay beneath them . When he began his analysis , he expected to find some slight variations in the magnetic field orientation in what is known as the Pontfarein flow and the underlying baked clay strata was almost exactly 180 degrees opposite to the present direction of Earth 's magnetic field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brunhes found a south . The only answer : magnetic reversals Brunhes recorded his stunning observations and drew the inevitable conclusion : Some time in the past , somehow , Earth 's magnetic field had reversed ? the poles had changed places . As befalls many scientific discoveries that reverse previous notions , Brunhes 's work proved indigestible to most of the geophysical community , being little noticed at first . The notion of magnetic-field reversals was not systematically tested until 1926 , when Motonori Matuyama of @#  | Kyoto Imperial University in Japan began to collect and analyze more than 100 rock samples from 38 locations in Manchuria and China . He found that all the samples showed magnetism either aligned with Earth 's present magnetic field or opposite to it . Moreover , he was the first to establish the ages of such rocks and thereby establish a timing for the reversals . He concluded that Earth 's field had reversed itself in the distant past and then changed back to its present " normal " direction around 750,000 years ago , an estimate that has since been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained hotly controversial for decades . Perhaps , some geologists suggested , a rock could somehow automatically reverse its magnetization , without any nonsensical reversing of Earth 's own field . In 1955 , the agenda of a National Science Foundation conference on rock magnetization posed the question , " Do we have acceptable proof that the Earth 's field reverses ? " It was not until the mid-1960s , after an overwhelming accumulation of evidence , that most scien-  | tists agreed that Earth had indeed undergone such reversals many times in the past . Consensus on the fact of geomagnetic reversals did nothing , however , to dispel the mystery of how and why they occurred , especially since geophysicists were unable to explain exactly how Earth 's field was generated in the first place . The only model for geomagnetism that has survived centuries of theorizing are versions of the self-exciting dynamo . In this picture of the geodynamo , heat from the radioactive elements at the core of Earth produces convection flows in the liquid-iron outer core , which is electrically conductive . The motions of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a field originally generated during the planet 's birth ) induces an electric current , which in turn generates a different magnetic field . And the geometry of the flows , currents , and fields is such that there is a feedback effect , enough to ensure a large buildup in Earth 's principal magnetic field until an equilibrium is reached . The trouble is that there are many such models feasible , some with two or four dynamos operating within Earth . As one expert put it , every dynamo theorist has a model , and no model agrees with another . Any attempt to sort these versions out mathematically is formidably difficult . The equations governing the magnetohydrodynamic behavior of the liquid core are so complex that they are virtually unsolvable , even on the most powerful of today 's ( and probably the next decade 's ) supercomputers . One of the virtues of the new theory , Muller says , is that it does n't depend on the correctness of any particular dynamo model , " but on the details of what is down there inside Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physics and astronomy at Berkeley . Morris , who once created a highly successful company making ceramic magnets in India , is now working on hightemperature superconductors . The genesis of the MullerMorris scenario can be traced indirectly to Nobel laureate Luis Alvarez , whose student at Berkeley Muller once was . It was Luis Alvarez and his son Walter who in 1979 first launched the radical notion that the recurrent wipeouts of many life forms on Earth ? mass extinctions ? were caused by giant impacts with extraterrestrial objects . Each impact , Alvarez pere et fils proposed , rocketed a massive cloud of dust and debris into the atmosphere , a cloud that obscured sunlight long enough to inhibit photosynthesis , markedly lower world temperatures , and wreak climatic havoc , causing the extermination of whole families of animals , such as the dinosaurs " How Science Traced the Killer Asteroid , " Feb. ' 83 . Subsequently , other scientists suggested that just such a chain of catastrophes would result from major nuclear warfare , a concept that came to be known as " nuclear winter . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raup , a highly respected paleontologist who is chairman of the geophysics department at the University of Chicago , and his colleague Jack Sepkoski published data showing that the extinctions occurred with marked regularity , at intervals of roughly 26 to 30 million years over the past 250 million years . The idea was outrageous to most geophysicists and biologists alike , because there was nothing on Earth that could account for periodicity on such a long time scale . Most paleontologists had always believed that mass extinctions were random ? how otherwise ? The explanation , Raup and Sepkoski wrote , was " extraterrestrial causes for the reason that purely biological or earthbound physical cycles seem incredible . " But what would induce asteroid or cometary impacts at regular intervals ? A skeptical Luis Alvarez asked Muller to review the evidence . " I considered a companion star to our sun , one with a period of 26 million years , from the first day , " Muller remembers . In the scenario that has come to be called " Nemesis , ' the star would revisit the neighborhood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a reservoir of perhaps 10 trillion comets in stable , circular orbits . There its gravity would unleash a shower of comets on trajectories toward the solar system . Over a period of a million years , perhaps dozens of these comets would strike Earth , with lethal effect . Muller is now engaged in a telescopic search program to find the Nemesis star , if it exists " Death Star , " June ' 851 . When Muller told Walter Alvarez , a geologist , about the death-star concept , Alvarez suggested that the periodic comet showers demanded by the theory should have created periodically distributed craters . When the two men analyzed data on 13 large ( more than six miles across ) craters that were between 5 and 250 million years old , they found a period of 28.4 million years that matched the extinction record . " I got into the magnetic-reversal business , " says Muller , " when I received a copy of Dave Raup 's 1985 paper showing an increase in the rate of reversals at regular intervals ? ten , forty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reversals during the last 170 million years and graphed the rate of reversals per five million years . The startling result , with a periodicity of 30 million years , appears in the illustration on these pages . " That lines up very well , " says Muller , " with the mass extinctions and also with our crater dating . Now that 's a funny coincidence ? too much so . And I just could n't ignore it . The two other cycles , extinctions and cratering , are due to impacts . If that is true , and all three cycles coincide , then impacts must cause geomagnetic reversals . So for about a year and a half I tried to come up with some way to connect an Earth impact with a reversal . " The problem is one of scale . An impact with even a large asteroid or meteor would not seem to carry enough energy to seriously disturb Earth 's motion in space . " Consider a big object , say ten miles in diameter , " Muller says . " Earth has a diameter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplify the calculation . That 's a ratio of one thousand to one in diameter , or a million to one in volume . And that 's not even taking into account the greater mass density of Earth . So you would expect the impact to have a very small effect . It 's comparable to a moth hitting a car . That 's not going to change the speed or the direction of the car . On the other hand , it can make a mess on the windshield . " I tried to find something comparable to that mess that could result in magnetic reversals . The breakthrough came @#  | when I got together with Don Morris . He pointed out that small effects can accumulate and eventually give you a large net effect . If you make a crater , for example , you move some mass from one place on Earth 's surface to another , and you could change the rotational velocity of the outer crust by a small amount , and over a long period that change could build up . When we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't move enough mass to account for any such result . " Then , says Muller , he remembered the nuclear-winter scenario ? darkness followed by cold . Dust from the impact crater and sooty particles from fires would change the climate and launch a little ice age . If the climate stayed cold long enough after an impact , a sizable quantity of water in the form of snow and ice would be transferred from warm equatorial waters to the poles . What would happen then ? Spin-up and catch-up " Like the whirling ice skater pulling his arms in , Earth would spin faster , " says Muller . " It was Don 's contribution to recognize that over a thousand years , the spin-up accumulates , and that can have an important effect on the interior . In essence , the crust and the mantle , which go around together , will get out of phase with the liquid core . I think of the inner solid core as the axle , the liquid core as the axle grease , and the crust and mantle as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes the axle a while before it catches up . " In the Muller-Morris theory , this difference in rotation rates would disrupt the convection flows that are the driving force of any dynamo model . The result would be to turn off the magnetic field . It would dwindle to a low value , so that whatever was left of the dipole would not reach the surface . And it would stay that way for perhaps 10,000 years , until the dynamo effect could rebuild the field . But such a dynamo does not have a built-in preferred polarity , so there is a 50-50 chance of the field either reappearing in its original orientation or flipping . " We believe , " says Muller , " that at least half the time the field grows back in the same direction . Those are called geomagnetic excursions , and there is evidence that they have occurred , although they are much more difficult to find than reversals . " The time sequence contained in our theory for changes in Earth 's magnetic field ? turning off , getting low , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up again either in the same direction or the opposite one ? fits just what is seen in the evidence of the rocks . We know of no other theory that can account for this sequence . " Muller and Morris recognize that impacts may not be responsible for all magnetic reversals . The sudden climatic change at the heart of their mechanism could have been caused by something else ? violent volcanic eruptions , for example . But volcanoes would not account for a striking coincidence : the occurrence of layers of tektites just at the magnetic boundaries marking reversals . Evidence from tektites Tektites are small , glassy objects ; once used as ornaments by ancient man , they have been found scattered in four widespread swaths called " strewnfields " both on land and in the sediments at the bottom of the sea . Most geologists now agree that tektites are the melted and resolidified splatters of solid material thrown out of the craters formed by the impact of large extraterrestrial bodies with Earth 's surface , a conclusion corroborated by the coincidence of large impact craters with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's leading expert on tektites , Bill Glass of the University of Delaware , has shown over the last two decades that each of these three splatterings occurred at the time of a geomagnetic reversal . " What we find most fascinating about the tektites , " says Muller , " is that we did n't know about them when we came up with the theory . They were brought to our attention after our first report appeared . That 's also when we learned about the Ries crater . " Fifteen miles wide , the Ries crater in southern West Germany is correlated with a tektite strewnfield in Czechoslovakia . The impact that created it is dated at 14.8 million years ago . " When some of the rock melted under the impact , " says Muller , " it recorded the direction of Earth 's magnetic field at that time . But the first layer of sediment to be deposited in the crater proved to be of opposite polarity . So a geomagnetic reversal must have occurred between the impact and the first layering of sediment , probably within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere coincidence are substantial . " There are other coincidences to bolster the Muller-Morris scenario . To effect the required change in Earth 's rotation , the drop in sea level had to have been at least 10 meters and fairly sharp ? inside a few hundred years . " When we started out , we did n't  | know whether ten-meter sea-level drops were common or could simply be ruled out , " says Muller . " We are basically not geophysicists . But one of the first things we learned is that they are in fact quite common . The data have been around for a long time , gathered by Peter Vail . They show no sudden sea-level rises , just sudden , major sea-level drops , what you would get from a sudden chilling . What is striking for our theory is that sixtyfive million years ago , at the time of the mass extinction that killed off the dinosaurs , we have the biggest sealevel drop ever recorded " No reversal is recorded for this extinction . But Muller points out that only half of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excursion . More coincidences When the known sea-level drops are plotted together with the rate of geomagnetic reversals over the last 160 million years , as in the graph with this article , another striking coincidence emerges : a gap in both around 100 million years ago . There is a marked absence of reversals from about 75 million to 110 million years ago , a hiatus roughly similar to the one recorded for sea-level drops . Room for one more coincidence ? " The most amazing thing we learned , just as we were preparing the final proof of our November 1986 journal paper , was a report by R. V. Krishnamurthy in India . He and his colleagues were examining a plateau that was once a lake bed in the Vale of Kashmir , and they found very short periods when there were changes in the carbon-nitrogen ratio and the carbon-13 ratio , both indicators of cold weather . And these sudden periods of cold weather , within their measurement uncertainty , come precisely at the times of magnetic reversals ! see graph I " How has the Muller-Morris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had a surprisingly warm reaction , " says Muller . " Some people are just skeptical about the whole business of periodicity . Others criticize us because we have n't worked out the details of a model ? we do n't have a cornputer simulation that shows how these events will actually happen . But the physics we 're discussing do n't really depend on a detailed model ... and we 're not claiming this mechanism accounts for every reversal , although it 's possible it does . " We are saying that the mechanism does account for a number of astonishing coincidences in the geological record . What else does ? " m VIVITAR ? CAMERA Give It Your Best Shot !
