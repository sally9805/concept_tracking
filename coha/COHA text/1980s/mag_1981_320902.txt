Cola wars in Thailand <P> The global sales competition between Coke and Pepsi has produced some of the catchiest tunes in advertising , as well as a lot of intricate high-level maneuvering in Washington , where the winner was sometimes determined by who sat in the Oval Office . PepsiCo Chairman Donald Kendall got the right to bottle and sell Pepsi in the Soviet Union in 1972 , when his friend Richard Nixon was in the White House . After Jimmy Carter moved to Washington , his old Atlanta pal Coca-Cola Chairman J. Paul Austin captured the exclusive right to sell Coke to a billion Chinese . Rarely , though , has the Coke-Pepsi rivalry gone so far as in Thailand , where it has now led to two deaths . <P> Both Pepsi and Coke have campaigned vigorously for the Thai market . Tropical thirsts have driven consumption of soft drinks there up to a strong 50 to 60 bottles per person per year , despite an annual per capita income of only $350 . Although Coke 's overall sales , including those of Sprite and Fanta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Coke alone has long trailed Pepsi by a wide margin . <P> In recent years , Coke had begun closing the gap , but the Thai government hurt the company 's sales a year ago when it raised the excise tax on soft drinks by more than 100% . That made Coke and Pepsi raise their prices from a dime to 15 a bottle . Thai peasants , who leaned toward Pepsi but occasionally bought both drinks , were forced by the higher prices to cut their consumption and choose one or the other . More often than not , they chose Pepsi . <P> Coke salesmen became increasingly nervous . One of them , identified only as Tin , spotted Pepsi Salesman Thongyu Meksuk putting up Pepsi posters in a small open-air restaurant on the outskirts of Khampaeng Phet , about 200 miles northwest of Bangkok . Such point-of-purchase advertising is important in Thailand , since about 96% of soft drinks are consumed where they are bought . Coke and Pepsi have long squabbled over prime space in cafs and other public places . <P> An angry Tin began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted at Tin . The two men then agreed to settle the matter with a fistfight and departed in clattering bottle trucks for a field near by . On the way , though , Tin pulled his truck alongside Thongyu 's and , according to witnesses , blasted him with a shotgun . Thongyu was left dead at his wheel ; Tin disappeared . <P> This was not the first murder in Thailand 's cola wars . Two years ago , a Pepsi distributor stabbed a Coke man to death . A court later ruled that the Pepsi employee had acted in self-defense . Such violence is common in provincial Thailand , where political instability has imparted a certain Wild West atmosphere . <P> But local officials of the two companies deplored the recent murder . Said Coke 's Win Mumby : " Both Pepsi and Coke have reasonable managements who try to prevent this kind of thing . " Added Pepsi 's Leonard DuBoff : " A poster certainly is n't worth a man 's life . " Thongyu 's death did accomplish one thing . For a few moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limits of their rivalry .
