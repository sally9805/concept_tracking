These UNESCO officials are resigned to a United States withdrawal - and hence the loss of a major chunk of its income. // But they are only now coming to grips with what programs to chop or economies to make in order to balance their truncated budget . And by far UNESCO ' s biggest expense is the salaries paid right here in Paris. // A huge 80 percent of the total budget of UNESCO is spent at its be-flagged , glass and steel Paris headquarters . According to the US State Department , other such international and national agencies spend much less on their bureaucracies. // The comparable ratio is 20 percent for the UN Development Program ( UNDP ) . The United Nations Children ' s Fund ( UNICEF ) spends 12 percent of its total budget at its New York and Geneva headquarters . For the US Agency for International Development , the figure is 8 percent , and the US Information Agency , 10 percent . ( UNICEF , which seeks to improve the health care , nutrition , and general welfare of children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanitarian program . ' ' It is quite separate from UNESCO. ) // Such alleged inefficiency is one main reason given for the Reagan administration ' s decision , announced a year ago and expected to be finally confirmed any day now , to pull out of the Paris-based organization . The other main US charge is that UNESCO has become unduly politicized , backing liberation groups such as the Palestine Liberation Organization and attacking press freedoms. // UNESCO officials vehemently deny the charges . And many American allies who agree that reforms are needed disagree with Washington ' s decision to withdraw. // But President Reagan is expected to announce the decision soon . In Washington , Gregory J. Newell , OK assistant secretary of state for international organization affairs , notes : ' ' There is a final recommendation over at the White House. ' ' // The Reagan administration has been under considerable pressure to delay its withdrawal for a year to see if needed ' ' reforms ' ' can be accomplished. // Maarten Mourik , the Netherlands ' ambassador to UNESCO , wishes the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the reform process , ' ' he says. // But Mr. Newell says the US ' ' has never seriously considered ' ' a one-year postponement of its departure . He argues that US withdrawal will do more to speed up reforms than staying and cites the 1977 US exit from the International Labor Organization in Geneva . ' ' Change seemed to be possible after we left , ' ' he said. // After being out of the ILO for three years , the US took up membership again in 1980 . Mr. Newell says the US will rejoin UNESCO ' ' if it returns to its original purpose. ' ' // Charles Hummel , the Swiss ambassador to UNESCO , hopes that UNESCO ' s desire to have the US rejoin , together with the announcement by the United Kingdom last month that it will leave at the end of 1985 , ' ' will produce real reforms.

One complaint of Western industrial nations is that too many UNESCO programs duplicate each other to some degree. // The US helped set up UNESCO in 1945 . Its original purpose was to advance the objectives of international peace and the common welfare of mankind through education , science , and culture . Today it has 161 members and a 1984-85 budget of more than $600 million. // Besides paying for headquarters expenses , the money has enabled UNESCO to be involved in campaigns that have brought literacy to more than 15 million adults and young people not enrolled in schools . It has aided in efforts to safeguard ancient monuments and sites - such as Venice , the Acropolis , the Plaza Vieja in Havana , the island of Goree in Senegal , and Sri Lanka ' s ' ' Cultural Triangle.

There is talk of a special meeting of its executive board next month . Officials from Paris were in Geneva last month to discuss how the ILO managed without American money for three years. // Mr. Newell says that next year the United States will channel its UNESCO contributions to other organizations that help in the educational , scientific , and cultural development of third-world nations . These include the United Nations Development Program and two State Department affiliates , the Agency for International Development ( AID ) and the United States Information Agency ( USIA ) . // Newell claims the shift will mean more money actually being spent on development rather than on salaries and other bureaucratic costs. // A report released Nov. 30 by the US General Accounting Office makes numerous suggestions as to how the management of UNESCO can be improved . It , for instance , found a need for more effective oversight of the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held that UNESCO has no effective system for evaluating the effectiveness of its program activities , and no adequate means for avoiding unnecessary duplication among its programs. // Despite Newell ' s arguments that the US departure from UNESCO will not do much damage to national interests , there remains some skepticism , particularly in the science community. // For example , Walter Rosenblith , foreign secretary of the National Academy of Sciences , said , ' ' In the sciences there is no overall substitute for UNESCO for the time being . ' ' He said the alternatives mentioned by Newell - UNDP , AID , USIA - lack experience , competence , and inter-institutional arrangements in science . Nor do they have adequate ties with the International Conference of Scientific Unions , an independent body that has received around one-quarter of its finances from UNESCO. // ' ' It is a lot easier to break dishes than to put together a new amphora , ' ' he said. // But Dr. Frederick Seitz , president emeritus of Rockefeller University in New York and a member of a UNESCO ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that if the US funnels sufficient money into the International Conference of Scientific Unions and other international scientific organizations , departure ' ' would not be a disaster . United States science is sufficiently strong that there is a great need to have us in the international scientific family , within or without UNESCO. ' ' // Besides its charge of mismanagement , the United States complains that UNESCO has become involved in political issues beyond the scope of its constitution ( such as giving money to liberation groups ) , introduced statist concepts emphasizing the rights of states rather than individuals into some of its programs ( including support for a system of licensing journalists under the guise of protecting them ) , and allowed its budget to grow unrestrainedly. // Though admitting a need for some management improvements , director general Amadou Mahtar M ' Bow denies all of these other charges. // UNESCO officials say headquarters expense comparisons are unfair , since they include some purchases for programs in developing countries and that local costs are often provided by host governments . But several UN experts maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency. // //
