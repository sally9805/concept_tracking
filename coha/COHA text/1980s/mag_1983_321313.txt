Johnny 's father " Gump " ran a local hardware store . Years later , when the boy began making it big in business , a reporter for the local newspaper went out to see Gump and asked whether he was surprised by his son 's success . <P> " No , " said Gump , " I always knew Johnny was a good boy . " Good as gold , almost . As chief executive officer of IBM , John Opel earned a handsome $1.3 million last year . He also owns $4 million worth of his company 's stock . <P> Compared with the Thomas Watsons , father and son , Opel appears almost bland . " Plain vanilla , " says one member of the IBM board , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive : " With Tom Watson , you knew stories about him . With Opel , there are no vibes . You just know , in a business sense , exactly what his goals and objectives are . " <P> In his simple but elegant office at IBM 's headquarters in Armonk , N.Y. , the only mildly unusual feature is a stand-up desk that Opel uses in addition to a standard one . He receives visitors with a correctness that is so smooth it can be mistaken for real easiness .

His career picked up fast in 1959 , when he was chosen to be an administrative assistant to Thomas Watson Jr. , then president , for one year . Following that , Opel began serving in a wide variety of posts , ranging from manufacturing to press relations . <P> Opel today gives visitors and colleagues a sense of self-containment , but he admits to having had a wicked temper . Once when he could not get a flat tire off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , he became so enraged that he bashed in the side of the car . " I do n't get angry the way I used to , " Opel says . But the old intensity , just barely noticeable beneath the perfect manners , can still be useful . " People know that I mean what I say and that I do n't suffer fools , " he says .
