By any measure , he is an unlikely leader in today 's world . Imprisoned since 1962 on a variety of charges , including conspiracy and sabotage , he has taken no active part in fomenting the black rage that in 1985 spread like a brush fire in the veld , leading to the deaths of more than 850 South Africans , almost all of them nonwhite . His words can not be legally published in the South African press . Only a few intimates even know what he looks like now ; he has not been photographed since 1965 . Yet from his cell in Pollsmoor Prison near Cape Town , Nelson Mandela , 67 , head of the outlawed African National Congress , has become an almost messianic figure , incarnating the aspirations of South Africa 's 23.9 million blacks . <P> From the teeming settlements of the Eastern Cape to the sprawling townships around Johannesburg and on to the outskirts of Cape Town , angry blacks have invoked Mandela 's name in demanding an end to the government policies of racial separation . The U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called for Mandela 's release as a sign that the white minority government is serious about negotiating with the black majority . Yet in February , when State President P.W . Botha offered to free him if he would forswear political violence , Mandela refused , saying , " Only free men can negotiate ; prisoners can not enter into contracts . " <P> If Botha could afford to ignore the demands for Mandela 's unconditional release , it was because , for all the anger and unrest , he knew that racial revolution was not imminent : the armed forces and police retain overwhelming power . In July the Botha government imposed a state of emergency in many black districts , sending in waves of police to restore order , break up public meetings , block processions and frighten protesters into submission . Then it effectively banned journalists from covering the unrest in the townships , in the futile hope that the protests would die when the images faded from the world 's television screens . <P> In Mandela 's enforced absence , other leaders spoke out for the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Desmond Tutu of Johannesburg , the 1984 Nobel laureate , who took an important role in the drive to control the savagery of some of the violence . In July he saved the life of a black man suspected of being a police informant , after an angry mob had seized the man , set his car ablaze and tried to throw him into the flames . Tutu scolded a crowd of 30,000 , threatening to " pack up and leave this beautiful country that I love so passionately and so deeply . " Privately , he later said , " I am really scared . We are building up an incredible legacy of hatred . . . How long can we restrain the people ? " <P> In the course of the year , the Botha government made a few concessions . It repealed the laws forbidding mixed marriage and sexual relations between whites and nonwhites . It promised that blacks living in urban areas would be entitled to some sort of South African citizenship ( instead of being " citizens " merely of poor but ostensibly " independent " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hated pass laws controlling the movement of blacks . These steps were notable departures from doctrinaire apartheid , but to millions of angry and unemployed young blacks in the townships , they were too little and too late .
