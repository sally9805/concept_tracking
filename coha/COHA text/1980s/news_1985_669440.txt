The United States accounted for $3. 75 trillion last year - almost one-fifth of the total. // Robert Summers , an economist at the University of Pennsylvania , calculated the global number ' ' on the back of an envelope . ' ' With two colleagues at the university , Irving B. Kravis and Alan Heston , he has taken a much more sophisticated look ( in the Journal of Policy Modeling ) at the distribution of income among the nations of the globe for the 1950-80 decades . Their recent findings are fascinating : // // // * The rich nations are getting richer and the poor nations are getting richer . Only four or five nations saw their standard of living drop in this 30-year period. // // * The world as a whole has grown in constant dollars by 4. 7 percent a year on average during the 1950-80 period . ' ' That ' s phenomenal , ' ' Professor Summers says. // On the basis of gross domestic product ( GDP ) per person , the 4 billion people in the world have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The figure is lower than for world growth because of growing population . ( GDP does not take account of income from overseas , whereas gross national product does ; GDP , therefore , measures economic activity within the geographical boundaries of a nation. ) // // * The fastest-growing group of countries are the middle-income nations , including some of the less populous OPEC countries and such countries as Argentina , Brazil , Egypt , Greece , South Korea , and so on . They enjoyed a 5. 8 percent annual growth on average in GDP for the three decades . That slips to 3 percent on a per capita basis. // These countries are catching up gradually with the industrial nations. // // * Next in the growth race were the ' ' centrally planned economies ' ' ( communist ) nations , including China , the Soviet Union , and the East European nations . ( The numbers for Cuba , Vietnam , Laos , and Kampuchea were not accurate enough to include . ) The others ' GDP grew at 5. 4 percent annually , or 3. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these nations have only small population increases. // ( Last year , by the way , the Soviet economy grew at only a 2. 6 percent rate . Among experts there is some suspicion that at least this communist country is having trouble maintaining its earlier rapid growth rates. ) // // * Thirty industrial nations grew at a 4. 1 percent average rate , or 3. 1 percent on a per person basis . The poorest nations - such as Afghanistan , Bangladesh , Ethiopia , India , Indonesia , and Pakistan - grew only 3. 9 percent a year , and , because of their rapidly growing population , just 1. 5 percent a year on a per capita basis . Thus , though the poorest nations were ' ' definitely ' ' becoming better off , their income gap with the rich nations has widened. // // * The inequality of incomes between nations is likely to be greater than that within nations . That inequality between nations seems likely to have increased between 1950 and 1980. // // * The communist countries have a third of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its output ( in 1980 ) . Still , their share of output grew from 22. 2 percent in 1950. // Within the market economies ' share ( 72. 5 percent ) , the low-income countries have a mere 9. 5 percent of output and more than 40 percent of world population . At the other end of the income scale , the industrial nations have two-thirds of the output of the market economies and only a fourth of the population . ( These industrial nations have about half of world output . ) That GDP share used to be 72 percent in 1950 but has been slipping with the more rapid growth of the middle-income and communist countries. // // * Despite all the fuss over the OPEC cartel , the oil nations ' share of world output remains small . In terms of constant 1975 dollars , their share was 4. 4 percent in 1970 and in 1980 . If current prices are used , reflecting changes in relative international prices , the oil nations ' chunk grows from 2. 5 to 5. 3 percent. // The study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' political subdivisions , ' ' all very small , that are home to 3 percent of the earth ' s population. // Professors Summers and Heston together did another paper for the Review of Income and Wealth which compares national incomes per capita on the basis of purchasing power . ( Mr. Heston is serving as chief of the international price statistics section of the UN Statistical Office . ) Among its findings are these : // 1 . The poor of the world are not so poor as simple translation of a country ' s income at current foreign-exchange levels would indicate . By examining the ' ' purchasing-power parity ' ' of nations - the relative cost of all the things made in each country , not just what enters into foreign trade - the University of Pennsylvania economists show that the poor countries , though indeed far poorer than the rich nations , aren ' t as bad off as the simple foreign-exchange calculation would show. // For example , India ' s per capita output of goods and services comes to only 2 percent of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistics of the United Nations International Comparison Project compiled at the university , India ' s per capita GDP rises to 6 percent of that of the US . Instead of being 50 times as wealthy as India , the US becomes just 16 times so. // So far the World Bank has not adopted the purchasing-power statistical system in its annual World Development Report . Since foreign aid levels and contributions to such international bodies as the bank hang partly on a nation ' s income levels , some poor nations , such as India , prefer to see their proverty - which is bad enough - exaggerated by the income comparisons based on foreign exchange. // 2 . The US remains the richest nation . In 1983 , its per capita GDP was $8 , 268 , with Sweden next at $7 , 479 . If foreign-exchange rates are used , such countries as Sweden and Switzerland sometimes appear richer than the US. // The UN International Comparison Project has been planning to publish a Phase 4 of its work based on ' ' benchmark ' ' surveys of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The third phase , in 1982 , depended on such surveys in 34 nations and was extrapolated to other countries . <> <> The world ' s wealth : a comparison of purchasing power <> Annual per capita gross domestic product by country .
