THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment NLY a specialist in federal budgetary matters can hope to weigh the merits of the Reagan Administration 's new economic policy ( the Washington Post 's helpful protracted editorial on the subject is already up to Part IX ) , but even to sideline observers of the economy there are at least two points that stand out as unusual . One is the policy 's unprecedented reliance on sheer theory , and the other is its reliance on faith . With the help of these two , economics  --  the " dismal science " ? has taken on an almost cheerful air in Administration circles . The theory , as everyone knows by now , is " supply-side economics , " which holds , among other things , that if you cut tax rates the economy will grow so swiftly in response that the total amount of taxes you take in will be higher . What is still better is that by virtue of that same burst of growth the demand created by letting people spend their money instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the economy , without bringing on the inflation that is thought to occur when too much money in the hands of consumers chases too few goods . In the opinion of the economist Walter Beller , who , as it happens , was an architect in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations of a tax cut that the Reagan people cite as a model for their own , the supply-side theorists " ignore common sense and arithmetic " and also " devastating evidence " of contrary results . He claims that experience has shown that tax cuts generate far more demand than they do supply , and points out that when the Kennedy-Johnson tax cut was put through , inflation was at less than two per cent , whereas now it is at twelve per cent . On the accuracy of the supplyside forecast , however , depends the coherence of the Administration plan as a whole , which calls for a balanced budget by 1984 ; the budget , of course , will only be further unbalanced if the tax cuts lead , as Heller and other conventional analysts think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But even if the conventional analysts are wrong ( and the Reagan economists say they are ) , the supply-side miracles would probably only cancel out the increase in the inflation rate which conventional theory predicts , and one is left wondering how an actual reduction in the inflation rate  --  the leading goal of the Administration  --  is to be achieved . This is where faith comes in . The Reagan people are divided on the point , but a number of them believe that , as the Washington Post put it , " their government-shrinking policies will almost of themselves produce a near one hundred and eighty degree turnabout in the economic expectations and behavior of consumers and businessmen , " and that this behavior , in turn , will bring down the rate of inflation . John Rutledge , a consultant to the Office of Management and Budget , has explained , " Our view of the world is that it is expectation-driven . The only value the past has is in teaching people to think about the future . What you need to do is to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will organize their lives around those signals . " In other words , if people have faith that inflation will come down , inflation will come down . Some of the thinking that underlies the new policy may have been revealed in a recently published book titled " Wealth and Poverty , " by George Gilder , which David Stockman , Pres-ident Reagan 's Director of the Office of Management and Budget , has called " Promethean in its intellectual power and insight . " The book is an evangelistic defense of capitalism which argues that the motive force of capi-talism is faith . Gilder writes , " Faith in man , faith in the future , faith in the rising returns of giving , faith in the mutual benefits of trade , faith in the providence of God are all essential to successful capitalism . " In a recent in-terview with Henry Allen , of the Washington Post , Gilder described some more fruits of his faith . " ESP is important to me , " he said , and he went on , " I learned that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilder lived was a psychic . He taught me how to do it . The single most strik-ing trick I learned how to do was cut-ting for the queen of spades in a deck of cards . I got so I could do it time after time .... The trick is that you have to have faith . " Summing up his philosophy aphoristically , Gilder writes in his hook , " Belief precedes knowledge . " It 's a manner of thinking that could get you to believe almost anything and is perfectly attuned to what may soon be the economic policy of the United States . In sum , the theory is that faith will bring about the economic results we all want . But faith in what ? In the theory , of course . Roundup OAFEW recent cultural doings in town : N the second floor of the Metropolitan Museum , Prudence Harper , curator of Ancient Near Eastern Art , was supervising the reinstallation of a remarkable collection of Assyrian art  --  twenty massive limestone bas-reliefs , two enormous freestanding stone figures of human-headed , winged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-eight delicately carved ivories  --  in the new Raymond and Beverly Sackler Gallery . The Assyrian objects , which have n't been seen as a group since 1968 , were all found at Nimrud , a large deserted mound in northern Iraq which turned out to be the capital city of Assurnasirpal II , one of Assyria 's greatest warrior kings . His city , which was built in about 880 B.C. and destroyed a little less than three hundred years later , contained palaces , temples , private houses , and , eventually , a big fort , where the formidable Assyrian armies were equipped and trained . Surrounding the city were five miles of mud-brick walls . In 879 , when most of the buildings were completed , Assurnasirpal gave a housewarming party and invited  --  according to a surviving inscription-69,574 guests , all of whom had a wonderful time . The Metropolitan 's bas-reliefs and stone figures come from a palace that was discovered in 1845 by Sir Austen Henry Layard , a British adventurer-archeologist , who , with a little help from the Bible , practically reinvented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century later by Sir Max Mallowan , a distinguished British archeologist ( and the husband of Agatha Christie ) , who continued Layard 's work at Nimrud with some financial help from the Metropolitan . Having absorbed this information from a handsome new catalogue , we looked around the gallery , a large , rectangular , high-ceilinged room where Miss Harper  --  a trim , attractive woman  --  was watching two art conservationists touch up some breaks in a seven-foot-high limestone bas-relief of a hawk-headed god mounted on one of the walls . Among the other panels we looked at were a profile portrait of King Assurnasirpal  --  a powerfully built bearded man with strong features , wearing earrings , a necklace , and bracelets , and carrying a bow  --  and a pair of human-headed , winged divinities , holding mysterious buckets and date-palm cones . " We think those objects are connected with some kind of fertility rite , but we 're not sure , " said Miss Harper . " We 've arranged the panels to give you an idea of a room in an Assyrian palace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This art is highly sophisticated for its period and place , and it 's mysterious , because nothing on such a monumental scale had ever happened in Assyria before . These panels represent a brand-new artistic tradition , which began with Assurnasirpal , and we have no idea how he happened to create it . " ? SEVEN blocks to the south , we found the Whitney 's 1981 biennial  --  a vast , exuberantly eclectic collection of works by living American artists , ranging from the very far-in ( realistic still-lifes ; expressionist and gestural abstractions ) to the very far-out ( three-dimensional environments ; video , sound , and film installations ) . The show , which covers three floors and includes a hundred and fifteen artists , is confined to work that has been produced during the past two years . Much of it is so experimental that when visitors encounter the three enormous de Koonings hanging at the entrance to the third-floor galleries they are apt to regard them as a welcome form of aesthetic refreshment On the second floor , we were taken with two ingenious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be an updating of trompe-l'oeil paintings . The first was Buky Schwartz 's " In MATCH 2 , 1981 Real Time , " an irregular yellow shape with a horizontal white rod in the center which had been painted into the corner of one of the Whitney 's large white walls . The yellow image was picked up by two television cameras and somehow transferred to four monitors as a perfect yellow square . Two of the monitors showed the square with the white rod ; the two others showed additional black and blue rods , arranged to form a Mondrianlike pattern . We looked around to see where these rods came from , and found a piece of blue tape stretched across a mirror that was tilted to reflect into one of the cameras . The black rod was harder to locate . After searching the room , we discovered that it was a piece of electrical tape that had been pasted onto the glass surface of each of the two monitors . Our second visual adventure consisted of two sixteen-millimetre film loops ? " Identity " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Efrat . " Identity " showed Mr. Efrat , a short , dark-haired man , standing in the center of a large wooden frame and painting it white . On closer inspection , the small screen on which the film was projected proved to have a tiny white wooden frame that matched the projected frame that Mr. Ef rat was painting . " Out and About " used a similar double image . It began with a blank white screen that had a small white bucket-shaped cup affixed to the center and a miniature elevator running up and down on its right side . Mr. Efrat ( on film ) emerged from the ( real ) elevator and painted a ( filmed ) wall gray and yellow , pausing from time to time to pour leftover paint into a ( filmed ) gray bucket that duplicated the ( real ) white cup . Eventually , he reached around to paint the bucket white , and as the bucket vanished into the ( real ) cup the artist vanished into the ( real ) miniature elevator . When we asked the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , he replied that he was concerned with defining surfaces in terms of exposure to the human eye . " There are two kinds of light  --  general light , in which we live , and the special , projected light of film , " he said . " Wherever the projected light hits , there is the context of the piece . " ? NCarnegie Hall , WNET was taping " Gala of Stars 1981 , " a gilt-edged vaudeville show that is scheduled to be broadcast on March 22nd . The talent was mostly straight THE NEW YORKER. classical , but there were two exceptions : Victor Barge , who brought down the house playing ? with a companion  --  a maniacal four-hand version of a Liszt " Hungarian Rhapsody ; " and Liza Minnelli , who torched and pranced her way through " New York , New York " in her best Las Vegas style . The hero of the evening was James Levine , who conducted the American Symphony Orchestra during the first half of the program  --  accompanying Itzhak Perlman in Sarasate 's dazzling " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rachrnanino ? ' s Second Piano Concerto , and Marilyn Horne , Montserrat Caballe. , and Sherrill Milnes in operatic arias  --  and then turned into a pianist to play part of a lyric Mendelssohn trio with Perlman and the cellist Yo-yo Ma , and to accompany Victoria de los Angeles in a couple of limpid German lieder . The heroine of the evening was Beverly Sills , who spent nearly four hours onstage  --  the taping was out of sequence and involved long pauses for technical adjustments  --  introducing artists ( " When I look over my right shoulder , please applaud with me " ) , making small talk ( Isaac Stern to Sills : " Long waits can be nerve-racking for performers . " Sills to Stern : " They can make the audience pretty sleepy , too " ) , and chatting up the audience ( " When I sang Zerbinetta here in 1969 with Erich Leinsdorf and the Boston Symphony , we did the original Strauss version , which was five minutes longer and a tone higher than the one that 's usually performed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career . It 's a note only dogs can hear , and there were a couple of them waiting at the stage door when I 'd finished " ) . The stage was decorated with hanging stars , a large neon sign , and fresh flowers ; the men were in evening clothes , and the women were dressed to the teeth . Miss Sills looked splendid in a long-sleeved , scoop-necked gown of iridescent blue chiffon ; Miss Horne swept onstage in a glittering robe of plum-colored metallic silk ; Miss de los Angeles looked fragile in a long , loose caftan of lilac-and-gold chiffon ; Miss Minnelli wore shimmering black chiffon pants and a halter top ; and Miss Caballe was enveloped in a deep-red silk dress that was covered by a surplice of black lace . Miss Minnelli and Jean-Pierre Rampal , the flutist , brought their own accompanists ; Mr. Borge brought his long-suffering assisting pianist , Saban Arzruni ; and Mr. Levine imported Reinhardt Elster , the Metropolitan Opera 's principal harpist , to play for Miss Cahalle 's " Pace , Pace " aria . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no time to rehearse , " Mr. Levine said afterward . " She sang the aria for me over the phone , so that we could agree on phrasing and tempo , and I asked Mr. Elster to play for her , because he 's done the piece with me so many times and he knows all the rubatos . But what you saw out there tonight was Take One . " Toward the end of the evening , we wandered backstage to the greenroom , where we found Victor Borge , white-haired and distinguished , talking about piano technique with Alexis Weissenberg , who was smoking a cigar ; JeanPierre Rampal pacing back and forth holding his gold flute ; Isaac Stern fiddling snatches of the Saint-Satins that he would play for Gelsey Kirk-land 's " Dying Swan ; " and Itzhak Perlman and Yo-yo Ma kidding with James Levine about the Mendelssohn trio . ( " Let 's go and rehearse the spot where we all play in unison , and then we 'll decide who stays out so it will stay in unison , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at eleven-thirty , champagne corks popped backstage and everybody began to unwind . " My God ! I feel I 've been talking for a week , " said Miss Sills as a WNET engineer unhooked her wireless mike . Mr. Levine , who had changed into a red sports shirt and navy slacks , lifted a glass and said , " What I did today  --  so many short pieces in so many different styles , one right after another  --  was harder than doing a five-hour Wagner opera . " Now and T hen F. went to a marvellous party on New Year 's Eve , awash with the best of our old friends , and we half expected that E. M. Frimbo , the oldest friend of all , would he there . Someone said to us , " You seem to have forgotten that this is the time of year Frimbo goes into his annual retreat . Right now , he 's on a train somewhere , shut away in his bedroom with the lights turned off . " And then we remembered that we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were spending the Christmas holidays in Pau , one of the most beautiful cities in France and certainly  --  with that tremendous view of the snowy Lower Pyrenees  --  the most beautifully sited city in France . It was pleasurably off-season in that splendid resort , and the jolliest of the few restaurants that were open for business was the railway-station buffet , at which we took most of our meals , to the accompaniment  --  via the buffet 's jukebox  --  of slender female voices coping with the French lyrics of all the country-and-Western American hit songs we thought we had left at home . At luncheon on New Year 's Eve , Frimbo came to table carrying a handbag . " You 're all the best of company , " he said , " but this is the day I become , for a brief time , that cat who walks by himself . " Outside stood a train so small as to be almost imperceptible , its snout pointed south , toward the Pyrenees and Spain . Frimbo 's disappearance into it raised the count , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was nearly alone by the time his train had wormed its way to the top of the Pyrenees and sloped off into Canfranc , the first station in Spain . He dined in solitude at the Canfranc station buffet , shut himself into his compartment in a Wagons-Lits sleeping car ( he was now completely alone ) , and arrived early the next afternoon in Madrid . It was a railway service that then offered itself only four times a week ( it now offers itself not at all ) , so we did not see Frimho again for three days . " What a wonderful journey ! " he said on his return . " And what a wonderful sleeping car ! The walls of my compartment were mahogany inlaid with bouquets of stylized golden flowers , and the window curtains were hand-knit lace . " Last week , in a vast crowd on the concourse at Penn Station , we saw an unmistakable venerable black homburg towering above the throng , and , sure enough , E. M. Frimbo was under it . " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . " I got to Grand Central at five that evening , downed a handful of smelts and a glass of white wine at the Oyster Bar , boarded my train as soon as it was announced , got into bed , propped myself upright , raised the shade , and turned off all the lights . There is no finer way of going into retreat . " " And ? " we said . " 1 do n't know when I fell asleep , but I do know that I did not hear a peep  --  of revelry or anything else  --  out of anyone or anything until a public-address system was announcing our arrival in Cleveland . My shade was still up , the sun was up even higher , but I knew that E. M. Frimbo would not bestir himself until the dining-car steward came along to inform everyone that the final moments of the breakfast hour were at hand . That was the one thing that got me out of my comfortable rolling cubicle before , in midafternoon , we attained Chicago . " We said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Spain , knowing , as he did , that extinction was about to overtake that unusual approach , but we wondered where Frimbo could find in the United States a train that could take him anywhere he had n't already been . " You will recall that I absented my-self from civilian life during two very large wars , and , in the course of my uprooting , and in the performance of my duties , I spent a deal of time travelling on troop trains , and even helping out in the oper-ation of them , " he re-plied . " It seems roman-tic to me now  --  barging about for so long a time , not of my own volition but under military orders , never knowing where I would be next . But it was n't all ro-mance ; although there were plenty of good-Joe types , who were philo-sophical about being in-ducted into the Army , the draft hoards sent us some fairly dubious types as well . One night when a contingent of recruits was occupying a couple of cars on a regular Baltimore &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gun from all of us went into the dining car and , when the stew-ard refused to serve him ryt.cALL/s-rs'e , " T ug - of- war , anyone . ? ? any more drinks , shot the man dead . Supervision tightened up after that , I can tell you . Well , this mid-December an Army friend who knows that I am what you might call a troop-train buff got me on the blower to say that a troop train the first one I 'd heard about in years  --  would he leaving New York on the third of January to return soldiers on Christmas leave to Fort Leonard Wood , which is really out back of beyond , a hundred and fifty miles southwest of St. Louis , at the end of a nineteen-mile branch line that had never seen a passenger train . At the fare Amtrak was asking , the train might be a sellout , but he had been promised that he could get me and a few other approved civilians aboard , even though the notices in stations along the way declared that the trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still the land of opportunity , and opportunity has to knock but once for me . So from Chicago I took a morning train to Minneapolis  --  I can never get tired of those many miles alongside the noble Mississippi  --  and a night train hack to Chicago , and then a just-born train on a newly invented route to Indianapolis , where I 'd collect my troop train in the morning . " A pause , and then : ' ' That day would be the diciest part of this retreat . We were not due in Leonard Wood until after nine in the evening , less than an hour before the bus we civilians hoped to catch to get back to St. Louis in time to nab an early-morning train to Chicago . There 's no accommodation at the Fort for civilians , so if we missed that we 'd have to wait until one in the morning for the next one , and the nearest airport would have nothing for us until after eight in the morning . I had a good look at the Indianapolis Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep breath , crossed myself several times , and approached the man at the ticket window . My train was running three hours late . Never mind ! The risk I was taking was worthwhile . The United States is retrograding in many respects , but the art of the troop train has really flowered . There was a car for checked luggage  --  checked luggage on a troop train ! There were six day coaches , none of them more than three years old  --  not forty . The floors were carpeted , and every seat was thoroughly upholstered and had its own overhead reading light . The thumping , clanging , and leaking steam pipes that warmed the cars of forty years ago had given way to a series of little grilles behind which electricity was doing its magic . There were two coaches with counters over which , all day long , an Amtrak crew was dispensing food and drink of considerable variety . There was no litter in the aisles . No one was roughhousing ; no one was reading a comic . And every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty-five soldiers aboard was young and chipper and orderly . A brace of drill sergeants were patrolling the train , but there seemed no need for them . And  --  novelty of novelties  --  at the rear end of one coach sat in mouse-like silence a clutch ( perhaps two dozen in all ) of girl soldiers , rather fetching in their jaunty big berets . What conversations I picked up here and there consisted not of barroom jokes but of talk about the problems of handling to best advantage the complex machines of war the soldiers had to deal with . I realized that for the first time I was in the presence of a new United States Army  --  a wholly voluntary one . Out of what I 'm afraid is sheer necessity , our Army is a multinational corporation , scattered almost worldwide . In one around-theglobe trip , I came across our Army in England and Germany and Spain and Australia and Turkey , and until the recent trouble there were clusters of it in northern Iran . " Another pause . And then : " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run into St. Louis . The Amtrak man who was serving as train commander bolted into the station , and when he emerged he said that Amtrak wanted the train deadheaded  --  run empty , that is  --  as soon as might be to St. Louis , where he 'd stick it on the early train to Chicago ; and that if any of us civilians wanted to chance going hack on it
