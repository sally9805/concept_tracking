Also scavenging , piggybacking and other new electronic capers <P> The customer , calling from Ottawa , was furious . Someone , he complained to officials of Telenet , a telecommunications network based in Vienna , Va. , was using its lines to penetrate his company 's computer . As a result , his operations were fouled up . The next week another computer network , named Datapac and tied to Telenet , got a similar call from a firm in Montreal . Its circuits too were being plagued by electronic interlopers . <P> Operating out of unknown terminals , possibly hundreds of miles away , the intruders had tapped into-or " accessed , " in computer jargon-one of the company 's computers . Even worse , they had actually " seized control " of the electronic brain , blocking the network 's legitimate users from getting on line , and were systematically destroying data . The raids continued for more than a week . During one foray , 10 million " bits " of information , almost one-fifth of the computer 's storage capacity , were temporarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repercussions : the Royal Canadian Mounted Police joined with the FBI to catch the criminals . By tracing phone calls , they soon got their man . Or rather boys . The culprits , only 13 years old , were four clever students at New York 's Dalton School , a posh private institution on Manhattan 's Upper East Side . <P> The bit-size bandits , perhaps the youngest computer con men ever nabbed , had obtained the Telenet phone number , coupled their school terminals to the line , and probably by nothing more than trial and error punched out the right combinations-in this case only five letters and numbers-to link up with the computers . More shrewd guesswork got them the " password " to log onto and operate the machines . <P> It was a schoolboy lark . None of the Dalton gang , even its eighth-grade leader , was prosecuted . But computer specialists were not amused . Besides costing the firms thousands of dollars in computer time , the incident was one more irritating example of the vulnerability of systems an that can have price tags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was also a sign of the growing incidence of computer crime . <P> No one can say exactly how much such crime costs ; often the losses are not even reported by embarrassed companies . But the larceny clearly is far from petty . It may well run to hundreds of millions of dollars a year . Last January , California became the first state to enact a computer-fraud law , allowing fines of up to $5,000 and three years ' imprisonment . Still , warns Donn Parker of SRI International , a leading scholar of electronic theft : " By the end of the 1980s , computer crimes could cause economic chaos . "
