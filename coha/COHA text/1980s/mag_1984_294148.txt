The recovery pumps life into sagging companies <P> Braniff Flight 200 from Dallas/Fort Worth to New Orleans last Thursday morning was by far the most important in the airline 's turbulent history . After being grounded in bankruptcy for almost two years , Braniff was back in business . It took off with freshly painted red-white-and-blue jets , a new major stockholder in the Hyatt Corp. , competitive fares , fewer employees and a slimmed-down route system serving 19 cities , vs. 49 before . Said William Slattery , 41 , the former TWA executive who heads Braniff : " We are looking to direct ourselves in ways that are so basic that they ca n't be easily countered by any competing airline . We want to project a staid , comfortable , conservative image that is nothing like the freewheeling one Braniff had in the past . " <P> The airline 's new self-confidence is typical of several major companies that are bouncing back after being given up for dead . All were victims of external economic problems and their own excesses : <P> too much diversification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nonetheless , they managed to find the money and talent to keep going . <P> They are , say Wall Street watchers , the beneficiaries of hard work , luck , a rapidly reviving economy and , above all , a will to survive . <P> Braniff 's plight was worse than that of most U.S. airlines . Nearly all were ravaged in the late 1970s and early ' 80s by problems ranging from rising fuel costs to competition from upstart cut-rate carriers . Under the brash leadership of former Chairman Harding Lawrence , Braniff began to add planes and expand routes just as the economy was dropping into recession and oil prices were heading for another sharp increase . <P> By 1982 Braniff was $1 billion in debt and snarled in a suicidal fare war with its archrival and fellow Dallas-based carrier , American Airlines . At one point Braniff asked its employees to forgo temporarily $8 million in pay to help meet other expenses . Then in May 1982 , lacking cash for food , fuel and salaries , Braniff became the first U.S. trunk airline to file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stored , while its management searched for ways to bring Braniff back to life . <P> The airline 's savior was Chairman Jay Pritzker , 61 , of Hyatt , the hotel-operating company . Pritzker and Braniff put together a deal that gave the carrier $70 million to get back into business , while Hyatt got control of 80% of the airline 's stock . Everyone , it seems , gave up something . Braniff s workers saw their ranks dwindle from 9,400 to 2,200 and their pay shrivel : pilots agreed to annual salaries of $38,000 , vs. an industry average of $68,900 . Creditors approved the revival plan , as did most of Braniff 's unions . Slattery was recruited from TWA . In December the final details were worked out , and the carrier got ready for last week 's rebirth .
