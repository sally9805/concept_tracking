In the suburban town where I live there has been  --  as there has been in a lot of places across the country  --  a fuss about electronic video games . In my town , a promoter sought permission to construct a monstrous emporium to house scores of these quarter-eaters , and a great many citizens came out violently in opposition . Really . // Some of this was , of course , no more than a case of routine generational hysteria , the sort of knee-jerk response we can expect from a certain segment of the adult population anytime anything new and mysterious comes along that appeals to the young . That 's life . That 's the way the middle ages . But somehow we have survived as a nation and as a planet these past three decades despite grim grownup assurances circa 1955 that rock ' n ' roll would be the ruination of mankind . Alas , the same old fleshpot world destroyed poor Elvis Presley , not he us. // It has also been difficult for me to think of video games as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games long preceded them . It seems to me that video games are to pinball about what big Prince metal rackets are to little old wooden ones . The products may be modified , but the arcades , like the tennis , remain much the same as ever . // Really . // I do n't use the above word just for the heck of it . " Really " is the word that arcade children  --  which is to say : all children  --  use these days instead of that quaint old word we formerly fell back on , " yes " as in : Will you marry me ? / Really . // The flip side of " Really " is " Not Really . " " Not Really " is what young people say now when they mean " no . " ( The first mistake we made was starting to call kids " young people , " but I digress . ) This generation simply ca n't bear to have the word " no " employed , lest someone might get around to saying " no " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even young policemen can bring themselves to say " no . " Not long ago , I asked one fuzzy-cheeked constable if I might park for a while in a no-parking zone . // He replied , " Not really . " // Really . // Possibly there 's some connection between young people playing video games all the time and their not being able to say " yes " or " no. " // But then , adults themselves are often no prizes when it comes to lucid , logical discourse . Most of the complaints I hear lodged against video games are couched only in what I call the alternative negative . That is : These games are bad because otherwise children would be doing something more valuable with their time . // I seize up when I hear that argument , because it is my experience that children , no less than adults , never make choices that way . We never say , well , this afternoon I was planning to read Plato for a while , visit some local shut-ins , then give blood and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tykes , but instead I 'm going to do something altogether worthless . No , it 's the human condition to decide in advance to do something worthless , and then to zero in on the specifics . // If kids were n't becoming mush-brained playing video games they would only be engaged in some other equally scurrilous or pointless activity . I doubt whether the quarter-chompers keep them away from homework or Little League or choir practice . // Who knows ? Maybe children who infiltrate arcades are actually being saved from much worse fates . The entrepreneur who was fighting to get the electronic emporium licensed in my town passed out bumper stickers that asked PAC MAN OR POT ? Reductio ad absurdum ? Do n't be so sure . Take the example of drive-in theaters in my day and age . Many grownups said these passion pits  --  passion pits !  --  were instruments of the devil , worse even than rock ' n ' roll . Now drive-ins are going out of business , and what have we got in their stead ? Coed dormitories , expansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I mean ? // Why , Billie Jean King even avers that the precocity of young athletes today may be accounted for by the extraordinary concentration they develop playing Space Invaders , Zaxxon , Donkey Kong and what have you from an early age . // Maybe each generation needs its own games no less than it needs its own music and clothes and heroes . I remember Pete Dawkins , the West Point Heisman Trophy winner , Rhodes scholar , now a general in Uncle Sam 's Army , studiously assuring me late one night that Frisbee was the ultimate athletic expression of our generation . And I hung on every word . // But that makes me think , too . Dammit , Frisbee is creative . It is n't chess . Not really . It is n't even canasta , and possibly it 's even on the low side of Family Feud , but it is you and the Frisbee all alone against the world . And pinball : Pinball games require a certain imaginative dexterity . They may even be a metaphor for life ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trick with pinball games is to know how to stretch , even to sorta kinda exceed the limits ... but ever so gingerly  --  to caress some extra points out of the machine without ever quite tilting the whole shebang . Pinball teaches you to skirt , to fudge , to finagle , to take sensible risks . Here was the situation : You were not supposed to bang a pinball machine at all , but you knew you could n't win replays without goosing it some . There was as much an art to playing pinball as there was to , say , growing up . // And herein lies the difference . Video games are not just sophisticated pinball machines ; they are not just larger tennis rackets . They are a whole different way of looking at life . Video games sparkle and flash , ring and sing , gurgle and shine , but that 's all tinsel . The quiddity of video games is that they are patterned . Did you know that ? You can go to a store and buy books that show you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's all rote . That 's why you read about these video idiot savants playing one machine for 40 or 50 hours in a row . They ca n't tilt ! You could get street-smart playing pinball , but with the video games you can only learn how to get in a groove , how to become , in effect , an extension of the equipment . // And that 's not playing . No game can be played that way , and I do n't care whether it 's golf or basketball or bumper pool or Frisbee or spin the bottle or cops and robbers. // Go to any arcade and watch the young people playing video games and you will see why they are an instrument of the devil . Games should be fun . Even when too much emphasis is placed on winning , half the people come away happy . But nobody ever wins at video games . Not really . It 's just a grind , paying two bits for the privilege of being part of a machine . And the kids ' faces show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It always looks to me as if everybody is taking the SATs or something , only you get bells and stuff instead of having to press down hard with a pencil . // You see , the critics have missed the point . It has nothing to do with whether the games are addictive . A lot of people are addicted to baseball , and that 's not so bad . It has nothing to do with whether the games are seductive . From time to time we all need to be seduced away from the finer , better things in life . It has , ultimately , nothing even to do with whether these games are too much fun . No , you see , it 's the other way around . Video games are n't excessively fun . Rather , they may not be fun at all . They are programmed not only to take quarters but also to suck up the imagination . And that is the ultimate cruelty for a child : That his very games must be serious toil . The one thing these video games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
