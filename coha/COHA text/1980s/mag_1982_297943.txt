THE CHALK GARDEN by Enid Bagnold <P> If plays were dice , Manhattan 's Roundabout Theater would be rolling sevens and elevens . In the past year this eclectic off-Broadway group has mounted a wryly tender A Taste of Honey , fired off an ebulliently witty Misalliance , weighed hypocrisy and humanity on the scales of The Browning Version , and now burnishes a high comedy of manners with Enid Bagnold 's civilized , pitiless and elliptical The Chalk Garden . <P> Though it has but one monarch , England does not lack for regally imperious voices . Mrs. St. Maugham ( Constance Cummings ) is a dowager queen who rules a country house , or seems to . She thunders out non sequiturs in the accents of invincibility . She is half dotty , half a sage and always right . As she tells Miss Madrigal ( Irene Worth ) , who has applied for the post of governess to her granddaughter : " Now that there are no subject races , one must be served by the mad , the sick and those who ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The house is well staffed with all three . Unseen on an upper floor is the dying Tinkbell , a butler before whom employers cringe , quite apart from guests . The current butler and harried man-of-all-work , Maitland ( Donal Donnelly ) , has done five years in jail as a conscientious objector . He is a flavorsome cousin of Bernard Shaw 's servants , brimming with querulous grievance . <P> While 14-year-old Laurel ( Sallyanne Tackus ) , Mrs. St. Maugham 's granddaughter , may not be certifiably mad , she does lead a bizarre fantasy life . She claims to have seen her father commit suicide when she was twelve , though he died of an alcoholic liver . In that same year , she insists , she was raped in Hyde Park , though this is her symbolic retaliation for her mother 's remarriage . She is also a live-in pyromaniac who blithely announces : " I set fire to things . " <P> <P> That is why she needs a governess . As it develops , Miss Madrigal is an ex-convict , but she is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until a **36;9822;TOOLONG confrontation in Act III with the judge ( I.M. Hobson ) who convicted her . Miss Madrigal , it develops , tended a garden during her 15-year sentence for murder . Under her wise ministrations the lime-based waste patch of the play 's title also promises to flourish , along with the love-parched inhabitants of the manor house . <P> The specific gravity of Irene Worth 's mode of delivery banishes frivolity and inspires conviction , as does the work of Constance Cummings and Donal Donnelly . Mrs. St. Maugham may not have been named that for nothing since The Chalk Garden measures human character with Maugham 's skeptic eye .
