An older woman strides confidently through the local headquarters of the American Association for Retired Persons and looks straight at the television camera . " AARP 's 27 million members believe that together , we can make a difference , " she says . " We 'll make sure you know what the candidates say  --  and what they do n't say  --  about issues . " Her tone is sweetly reasonable . But just to make sure those video-dazed viewers in Iowa and New Hampshire sit up and listen , she shakes her spectacles at them and adds , " If you think you 've seen it all , you ai n't seen nothin ' yet . " <P> Blunt and a tad belligerent , America 's senior citizens are suddenly flexing their biceps in presidential politics . Flush from a Capitol Hill victory that protected Social Security increases from the budget ax , the Gray Lobby has turned its muscle to states where early contests will winnow the field of presidential candidates . Across the country , campaign operatives report that no other group has emerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any candidate who wants to win in 1988 is not going to mess with the old folks , " says Thomas Kiley , an adviser to Michael Dukakis . <P> Until this election , AARP had not focused on presidential politics . But now the organization is launching an $8 million get-out-the-vote effort , running a $400,000 television ad campaign , sponsoring candidate debates in Iowa that are beamed by satellite to other states , holding workshops for activists and organizing mass mailings that will hit a million households by Election Day . In doing so , it has made the sanctity of Social Security and the expensive dream of Government-sponsored long-term health care top issues on the 1988 agenda . <P> Candidates , knowing that senior citizens flock to the polls with a vengeance , have responded with a gusher of saccharine rhetoric . " If we can get a man to the moon , we ought to be able to get dentures to people who built our society , " went a sample line from Democrat Paul Simon at AARP 's Iowa debate . The 1,000 gray-haired activists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wally Wakefield , a retired salesman from West Des Moines , could n't help gloating . " They came because of us , " he said . " We 're powerful . " <P> Founded in 1958 mainly to provide insurance for retirees , AARP is now the nation 's largest special-interest group . " Join the Association that 's bigger than most countries , " boasted a recent magazine ad . This elderly behemoth , nearly twice the size of the AFL-CIO , continues to grow by about 8,000 new dues payers a day . One out of nine Americans belongs , paying a $5 annual fee . AARP offers drug and travel discounts , runs the nation 's largest group-health- insura nce program and a credit union . In addition , its savvy media operation includes Modern Maturity , the nation 's third highest circulation magazine ; a wire service that provides newspapers with " unbiased reporting " on elderly issues ; and a weekly television series .
