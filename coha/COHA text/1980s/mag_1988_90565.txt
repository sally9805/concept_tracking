It looked like a scene out of Miami Vice . The hero , played by Don Johnson , was at the wheel of a pristine white speedboat , bouncing off the waves at 90 mph in a crowded Florida harbor . His jaw was firmly set and his gray eyes were as cold as steel as he closed in on a white futuristic-looking catamaran with twin bubble canopies hiding its crew . Close behind Johnson , driving an orange Vee-hull with a wing behind the cockpit , was the husband of a Princess of Monaco , who was ... well , somehow involved in all this . // But this was n't a TV show . It really happened on Saturday off Key West at the American Power Boat Association 's Offshore World Cup , the glitziest and most prestigious race on the circuit . When it was over , Johnson , known to millions as TV cop Sonny Crockett , had won the World Cup title in the Super-boat class ( boats of unrestricted engine size and specification ) . // Though offshore racing is a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Cup Championships , which have been held off Key West for the past few years , have served as center stage for some of the most improbable intrigues in the sport . For a couple of years the top two Superboat drivers were Al Copeland Sr. , the Popeyes Fried Chicken tycoon , and George Morales , a convicted cocaine smuggler from Colombia . This time the showdown was between Johnson and Tom Gentry , a real estate magnate from Hawaii who beat Copeland for the 1987 title . // Nearly 110 boats were entered in the World Cup 's nine classes , but most of the attention was focused on the seven entries in the Superboat category . Gentry was driving a 48-foot Cougar catamaran with four 850 hp turbocharged engines . At a time trial in March of ' 87 , outside New Orleans , it was clocked at a world-record 148.238 mph . Johnson 's boat , a Vee-hulled 46-foot Wellcraft Scarab powered by three 850 hp engines , is also owned by Gentry and had reached 107 mph earlier in the week . // Lately DJ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a roll . He has recorded Till I Love You with Barbra Streisand , whom he has also been dating for almost a year , and he has been getting glowing reviews for his role in the movie Sweet Hearts Dance . But for the moment anyway , those achievements must take a backseat to the powerboat title . " A lot of salty dogs wondered what I was doing here , " he said when he picked up his trophy . " But , by god , I 'm a world champion . It almost makes me legitimate . " // Johnson began driving high-performance boats while filming Miami Vice and had gotten expert instruction in the handling of the show 's 38-foot Scarab . As he improved , he began performing his own stunts , which sharpened his timing and control . Last year he was invited to drive in the Mississippi River Challenge , a race from New Orleans to St. Louis . With the help of throttleman Gus Anastasi and navigator Thomas George , he won in a record 19 hours 51 minutes . Since then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three this year , using one of Gentry 's boats . // Johnson is quick to acknowledge that his role in last week 's victory was secondary to his crew 's . This year Anastasi has been his navigator and coach , but the real secret to Johnson 's success is throttleman Bill Sirois , who performed the same task for 1986 World Cup champion Copeland . " Those guys are the meat and potatoes of this crew , and the best in the business , " says Johnson . " Without them , I 'd be lost out there . " // Even though the Superboats stole the spotlight in Key West , the fastest craft on the water all week was the open-class ( restricted engines ) winner , driven by Stefano Casiraghi , the husband of Princess Caroline of Monaco . Named Gancia dei Gancia for its sponsor , an Italian winemaker , Casiraghi 's boat was a light , 44-foot Vee-hull with an overhead wing for stabilization . It was powered by four 600 hp turbocharged diesel engines developed by the boat 's owner and throttleman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe this year , including the World Championship in England . // The third and final leg of the open-class competition began about five minutes after the start of the Superboat final . but Casiraghi , who averaged a high 89.073 mph. finished only six seconds behind Johnson . " Superboats , they are a joke , " said Buzzi . " They are a contest over who can spend the most money . " // That did n't seem to bother the fans , however . They cheered feverishly as Johnson 's older and slower , but more reliable , Vee-hull took on the catamarans of Gentry and Copeland , the APBA National Superboat champion for the past five years . Copeland 's boat , Popeyes/ diet Coke , failed to finish both the first and second legs of the race , held on Tuesday and Thursday , respectively . Gentry beat Johnson in the first leg by one minute and 39 seconds , but he broke a drive shaft coupler on Thursday , allowing Johnson to come in first . Because Saturday 's 149-mile final was worth almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs , Johnson knew a second-place finish would clinch the crown for him . For good luck in the final , he invited Mercedes Pe ? a , a 100-year-old fan who had given him a kiss before his victory on Thursday , to the race . // Morning winds came in at 15 knots , stirring up both the seas and Johnson 's hopes  --  his Vee-hull handles rough water better than catamarans do . Gentry and his throttleman , John Connor , got off to a fast start , setting a 100-plus mph pace for the first of six laps . By the halfway point , the winds had calmed down and Gentry opened up a substantial lead . On the fourth lap Johnson caught up with Copeland , who was in second place , and sped past him when his boat died in the water with engine ills . " After that , as much as I tried not to think about it , it was hard not to make a lot of promises I hope I can keep , " said Johnson afterward . " But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay in place and not break . " He did just that , finishing second , 1:46 behind Gentry . That gave Johnson 708 points to Gentry 's 689. // After his five-man crew flung him off the dock in celebration , a soggy but jubilant Johnson sat on his boat 's deck and talked excitedly , still deflecting credit . " I happened to point the boat in the right direction , but it was Sirois who kept the hammer down , " he said . " And hey , do n't forget my mechanics , Phil Garr and Wally Sowin , who stayed up until 4 a.m. putting in the engines . " // Wellcraft already makes a Don Johnson Signature Edition Scarab 43 . Now Johnson may build his own Superboat and defend his title in it next year . He was asked what kind of boat it would be . " The fast kind , " replied Johnson with a wide grin , sounding more and more like a real racer.                 @ @ @ @
