A year of convalescence with a mild recovery beginning in the summer <P> For the third time in a row , Western Europe is entering the new year in recession . While there is a prospect of economic recovery beginning in the latter half of 1982 , the long-awaited upswing is likely to be highly vulnerable . It could be snuffed out , for example , by a renewed surge of interest rates in the U.S. , another bout of currency gyrations or the surrender by hard-pressed governments to mounting pressures for trade protection . Moreover , a sustained pickup is threatened by the increasingly divergent economic performances and policies of the members of the European Community . <P> That is the rather dour outlook of the six members of TIME 'S European Board of Economists at a year-end meeting held in Rome . The group 's concerns about the state of business were compounded by doubts that political leaders will persevere with unpopular , anti-inflationary policies at a time of serious unemployment . For the first time in postwar history , the jobless rate in Western Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Nonetheless , the TIME economists saw little alternative to continuing current austere policies . Said Herbert Giersch , director of the University of Kiel 's Institute for World Economics : " It has taken us ten years to get into this mess , and it will take us that long to repair the damage done by Keynesian remedies in the past . " <P> Despite these worries , Hans Mast , a University of Zurich lecturer and executive vice president for Credit Suisse , saw reason for some optimism . Inflation is slackening almost everywhere , he noted , and towering interest rates have started to come down . This should encourage companies to borrow more in order to build up their low inventories , which would stimulate production . Said Banker Mast : " We are not suffering from a shortage of money to lend . Much of the money we send to the oil producers comes back to the West in the form of bank deposits , and is available on the international market . " <P> Mast and others warned that the health of European business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. economy and the Reagan Administration 's program of large budget cuts , tight money and major tax reductions . American experts generally believe that the U.S. will remain in recession for the first half of 1982 and then grow at about a 4% annual rate during the second half . " I hope the Reagan gamble will come off , " said Mast . He added that if it fails , the world could move into a " stop-go " economic situation that would probably make both inflation and unemployment worse . <P> The Europeans will be anxiously watching the preparations for this year 's American congressional elections for any signs of a shift in economic policy toward less strict monetary controls or a less serious battle against budget deficits . Such a change would affect not only the U.S. but the whole world economy .
