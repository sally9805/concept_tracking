In pursuance of its self-appointed mission of ' ' resisting hegemony by foreign forces , ' ' the Lebanese Forces ( LF ) last month played a key role in foiling what it saw as an attempt by Syria to impose its own choice of president on Lebanon. // The LF called a boycott of the special election session of parliament , and succeeded in denying a quorum to the Syrian-backed candidate , former President Suleiman Franjieh. // ( In Beirut yesterday , Lebanon ' s speaker of parliament called on deputies to meet Sept. 22 to elect a new president . A Lebanese Forces official said the speaker ' s initiative was positive but should be accompanied by an agreement on a consensus candidate , Reuters reports. ) // // Whether this position leaves open the possibility of another Lebanese Forces-engendered boycott , is unclear - but not unlikely in the light of past actions. // The interference in August was the latest in a long series of defiant acts by the LF against Syria , which has at least 25 , 000 troops in east and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance , the militia commander , Samir Geagea , seems an unlikely figure to challenge the might of the Syrian Army . He is slim , pallid , and balding at 36 . ( ' ' He has many worries , ' ' an aide says. ) // But Mr. Geagea ' s known charisma and fire ignite his features as he lashes back at charges by the Syrians and their mainly Muslim allies that his militia intimidated Christian parliamentarians into staying away from the August vote. // ' ' All this talk of pressures in the eastern ( Christian ) areas ( of Beirut ) is put about by Franjieh ' s group and Syria ' s people to justify their failure , ' ' he said in an interview . ' ' We know who puts pressures in Lebanon , who kidnaps foreigners and keeps hostages , who hunts down deputies and kills personalities opposed to Syrian policies . These charges are thrown back at their authors . The facts speak for themselves. ' ' // When pressed , Geagea admits that his men did surround the houses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this was at their own request , to give them an excuse not to go , in order to avoid Syrian reprisals. // Geagea came to power in the Forces in January 1986 , when , in alliance with militiamen loyal to President Amin Gemayel , he staged a coup against then-LF commander , Elie Hobeika . Mr. Hobeika had signed a Syrian-sponsored settlement accord with Lebanon ' s Druze and Shiite Muslim militias which , Geagea believed , gave away too many Christian political prerogatives. // Opposing the Syrian presence and working for its removal from Lebanon are the raison d ' etre of the Lebanese Forces under Geagea . Is he willing to negotiate with the Syrians over the country ' s future ? // ' ' As long as they insist on not withdrawing from Lebanon , no way , ' ' he says . ' ' If the Syrians demonstrate a desire to withdraw , and set a timetable , then we have no objection to talks , as long as they don ' t impinge on Lebanon ' s sovereignty , independence , and freedoms. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of defying the Syrians . Security around him is probably as tight as that around any leader in the turbulent Middle East . Cars entering the LF headquarters compound at Karantina , near Beirut port , are scanned for explosives with electronic devices . No vehicle is allowed near his own office building . Visitors go through three rigorous security checks and a body search . Behind his desk stands a large paper-shredding machine. // Geagea is not paranoid : Someone really is out to get him . In May , he narrowly escaped death when a car bomb went off as he was visiting the north . More recently still , there have been rumors that a clever car-bomb attempt at Karantina , involving a switch of identical vehicles , was foiled. // The Forces ' founder and inspirational hero-martyr , Bashir Gemayel , was crushed under tons of rubble when one of his headquarters was demolished by a bomb in September 1982 . Three weeks earlier , he had been elected President in a vote heavily influenced by the Israeli presence in and around Beirut. // The LF ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozens of car-bomb attacks over the years in West Beirut and other Syrian-controlled areas , though it has denied the charges. // But since Geagea took over , the Forces have been reorganized and developed into something much more than a militia. // According to Mr. Dib , who heads the LF ' s ' ' Secretariat for Internal Affairs , ' ' more than 70 percent of the Forces ' budget was spent on the military side when Geagea ousted Hobeika two years ago . Now , Dib says , only 35 percent of the multi-million-dollar budget goes to the military , who make up only about half of the LF ' s 20 , 000-odd personnel. // Apart from the Lebanese Army itself , the LF have become by far the biggest employer in the Christian areas . ' ' Quite apart from the military , we have 1 , 500 college graduates in the Forces . On the military side , we have 600 officers and 800 NCOs graduated from our own military college , ' ' Dib says. // An engineering graduate of The American University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consultancy , Dib personifies the new image the LF are cultivating : efficient , technology-wise , performance-oriented , lower-profile , ' ' perhaps less charismatic than before. ' ' // But he insists that , despite his computers and personnel grids , the Forces are suffused with a new spirit of public service and a sense of mission more important than efficient management structures. // Twenty percent of the militia ' s budget is now spent on social programs inside and outside the LF . There are schemes for medical assistance , student grants , housing and food subsidies , family allowances , emergency social funds , and a host of related services. // Apart from such welfare projects , the Forces ' activities extend into virtually every area of everyday life in the Christian areas , effectively creating a private state within the state. // The LF levy taxes , mainly on real-estate transactions , gasoline sales , and the Christians ' lifeline to the outside world - the overnight ferry to Cyprus . They organize public transport , and even have the trains running on time , reviving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their own police and courts , running parallel to , and superseding , those of the state . They have their own newspapers , and radio and TV station . Its mix of mainly Western movies and comedy shows has been so successful that the LF are now launching a second channel , consciously aimed at diffusing the Western values and culture the LF espouses. // Not everybody appreciates the militia ' s all-pervasive penetration . Some large business companies deeply resent the LF ' s efforts to organize cells among their workforces. // Some diplomats say Geagea ' s streamlining of the military side of the Forces has welded them into a formidable and cohesive machine . But some well-placed Christian sources are skeptical , pointing out that since Geagea took over , the LF has had little combat experience. // ' ' It may be true that our popularity is down from six years ago , when Bashir was at his height , ' ' admitted one LF official . ' ' But don ' t underestimate the will of the Christians when it comes to Syrian attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Thank goodness the Forces are around. ' ' ' // //
