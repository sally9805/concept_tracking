Poise and determination have been among the principal calling cards of the Boston Celtics for a quarter-century , and the men of Bill Fitch fell back on their heritage to nail down a 113-107 playoff victory before a mob announced as 19,995 at the Chicago Stadium last night . It was an ending reminiscent of Yankee Stadium , as fans in the lower twosections spent the last 10 minutes of their evening ' s stay attempting to dodge full beer cups that were being thrown from the upper section . In addition , at least three major fights broke out in the old building , proving that too many people had come for a reason other than to see a pair of quality professional teams play basketball . The Celtics have now taken a surprising 3-0 series edge , and it must be pointed out that the Bulls would be precedent-shatterers to the extreme were they to squirm off this particular hook . Not once in the 35-year history of the NBA has a team come from an 0-3 deficit to win a playoff series . Boston never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading , 87-85 . A Dwight Jones layup tied the game - which encompassed 20 lead changes in the first three periods - for the fifth , and final time , but Cedric Maxwell ( 19 points ) , a stout laborer in the pits all night , swung in for a picture-book hook to put Boston ahead to stay . This is not to say that it was an easy stroll down the lane for the visitors in the final period . Boston led by no more than six until a pair of Kevin McHale free throws with 1:18 left provided the Celtics with a 109-102 lead . The Celtics damn near gave the game away in the final 31 seconds . Leading , 111-105 , and in possession of the ball , Boston got in immediate trouble when a pass sailed through Robert Parish ' s hands . Reggie Theus ( 26 ) fired in what appeared to everyone to be a three- pointer . Theus produced another steal , and the Bulls amazingly got off three more unsuccessful three-point tries before the Celtics recovered the ball . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball with eight seconds left , Jerry Sloan was informed that the Theus basket had only been a two-pointer , whereupon the fiery Chicago coach threw a major-league tantrum . At any rate , Maxwell drew a backcourt foul , and he sank both shots to ice the game . Chicago managed one key thing it had not done previously in this series . The Bulls shackled Tiny Archibald by not allowing the game to resemble the Drake Relays . In fact , Chicago actually defeated Boston inthe transition game by a 22-14 count . The Bulls did some very nice things , all right , but they could not control Larry Bird , who once again demonstrated that when it comes to finding different ways to win a ball game , he is the contemporary master . Bird ' s totals of 24 points , 17 rebounds and 10 assists in a 48- minute Havlicek stint only begin to tell his story . After a cold first half , he joined with Parish , a 6-for-8 second-half shooter , to share 20 points as the Celtics turned a 60-57 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six rebounds to his 10 third-period points in a tremendous hustling effort . Chicago , which had suffered from bad starts in its previous playoff efforts , came out smokin ' this time , jumping into a 14-4 lead that featured six fast-break points . But the Celtics emerged from a timeout at that point to play steady , no-panic basketball for the rest of the period . With Chris Ford firing in a trio of three- pointers , Boston caught the Bulls at 32-31 before a mild Chicago flurry gave the hosts a 35-32 one period lead . The clubs battled through 11 lead swaps in the second period before Chicago claimed a 60-57 lead , but even then the Chicago squad had to be questioning itself , for they had played far too well for a skimpy three-point lead . Chicago had problems keeping its two key big men in the game , and this , too , proved to be costly . Artis Gilmore was sat down with two personals at the 14-10 juncture , sitting out the last 7:12 of the period . And David Greenwood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening period , would later sit in frustraion for a stretch of 9:45 , departing with Chicago trailing , 75-74 , and returning with Boston leading , 99-97 . But while Boston was getting its accustomed frontcourt lift from McHale ( 13 points ) , the Bulls had no such bench help up front . The Bulls could have put the game away in the first half but they didn ' t . They were still alive as late as 105-102 ( 2:46 ) when Bird missed a runner and Greenwood converted a fast-break layup . But Bird found Archibald underneath for a killing layup on the next Boston possession , and the Celtics really dug in on the D here , as Chicago ' s next two possessions consisted of a long Greenwood corner in-and-outer and a Greenwood 28-foot clock-beating heave resulting from Parish ' s block of a Ricky Sobers shot . And so the Bulls , down 3-0 , must be frustrated . They had shot 50 percentfrom the floor . They had kept Boston from running . They had received the backing of at least 22,000 people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a great Celtic triumph . Nobody should give you any argument .
