 | The Royal Couple in private as you 've never met them before ? in their London and country homes . behind the scenes on their tours . and being just " Mummy " and " Papa " to their two sons . Those invited to visit the Prince and Princess of Wales at their home in Kensington Palace pass through strict security checks and are normally met by the butler , Harold Brown . But sometimes not far behind is a small boy in shirt and shorts with a firm step and a slightly quizzical look on his face . The little boy is Prince William . When he is around the house , there is always somebody with an eye on him ; if it 's not one of his  | parents , it 's either Harold Brown , his nanny ? Barbara Barnes ? or one of the royal detectives . He pops up in different parts of the building , often asking people who they are and what they are doing . The Prince and Princess have two homes ? their apartments at Kensington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kensington Palace is their weekday address , and Highgrove is for weekends and summer breaks . Their office work is also divided ? between Kensington Palace and Buckingham Palace , where the Prince of Wales 's office is on the ground floor of the south wing . But the Prince and Princess themselves do not do much office work there , so the staff often come to them at Kensington Palace , a mile or so away . Kensington Palace is really a family home . It consists of the State Apartments , which are open to the public , and the private London homes of the Prince and Princess @#  | of Wales , Princess Margaret , the Duke and Duchess of Gloucestershire , and Prince and Princess Michael of Kent . Apartments 8 and 9 , which are now the Prince and Princess of Wales 's home , are the three stories of a house where kings George I and George II kept their mistresses . The house faces onto a courtyard called the Prince of Wales 's Court . The house containing their apartments was badly damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derelict until 1975 , when repairing and restoring began . The restoration took so long that it was some months after the Prince and Princess 's wedding in 1981 before it was completed . Until then they had lived in Buckingham Palace . The apartments at Kensington Palace consist of a large drawingroom , a sitting-room for the Princess , a study for the Prince , a kitchen , a dining room , bedrooms , a playroom , and accommodation for the staff . In her sitting-room the Princess holds meetings with her ladies-in-waiting and her equerry . In the room are many of the photographs she has taken of her family . There is also a video recorder with which she and the  | Prince can catch up on any of their favorite television programs which they have missed while out on engagements . They also like to watch videos of films . The sitting-room where they sometimes watch the films is quite small , and the house , in general , is smaller than the public might suppose . The royal dining room , for example , also has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often have to be cleared away quickly and the pens , documents , and writing pads laid out . Dinner and receptions help the Prince to meet the people involved in his charities , trusts , and committees . Apart from the official ones , there are private dinner parties for friends and for people in whom the Prince and Princess are especially interested . The meals are cooked by chefs who travel between Highgrove and Kensington Palace . Naturally , they know the Prince 's and Princess 's likes and dislikes and their current favorites , but the Prince often comes up with ideas that he would like them to try . The Princess is careful about what she eats . but friends say she can , when she wants to , put away more than they do . At other times there is a similarity with the ballet dancers from the London City Ballet , of whom she is the patron . The Princess and the dancers turn their noses up at the thought of hamburgers and French fries . She told them that she can get very tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a piece of chocolate , she can " get through anything . " Dotted around their Kensington Palace apartment are the souvenirs and presents from royal tours , and those for which there is not room on display are stored . The couple pay particular attention to those presents that they were given for their children . The Princess is very particular about the two young Princes ' appearance . She sometimes dresses them in matching blue and white outfits , but Prince William is now old enough to have his own favorites . The red shorts he wore on his first day at school were particularly popular for a time . Prince William calls his mother " Mummy , " and his father " Papa . " They call him William ; the nickname " Wills " seems to be less popular now , though " Wombat " seems to be on the increase . Prince Henry is just " Harry . " Because of the enormous public interest in the children , their parents are extremely protective if anything goes wrong . When Prince Henry had a collision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some stitches about his nose , the staff was sworn to secrecy . The accident stayed secret until Prince Andrew 's wedding day , when a close-up of the Buckingham Palace balcony as the Princess carried Prince Henry into public view for the  | first time since the accident showed the scar left by the stitches . Small bumps apart , Highgrove is a wonderful place for the royal children to grow up in . And there the Prince and Princess have a little more time to be on their own with their sons and to play with them in the gardens and the farmland around the house . Like Kensington Palace . Highgrove House in Tetbury is smaller than might be expected for a royal residence . When it was advertised for sale in 1980 , the real estate agents called it " a distinguished Georgian house with spacious but easily managed accommodations , comprising 4 reception rooms , domestic quarters , 9 bedrooms , 6 bathrooms , nursery wing . full central heating . " That may have sounded large enough . but then the Prince was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as the attendant nannies , security , and other back-up staff . Already some staff who travel down from London have to stay in a local hotel , and it has been suggested that with the probable arrival of further children in future years , the house will not be large enough for a permanent royal home . A new house , perhaps even built to the Prince 's specifications , could be a solution . Clarence House . at present the home of the Queen Mother , could be another , long-term , possibility . In the early days of her marriage it was said the Princess disliked Highgrove . If that were ever true , it is not now . She seems entirely happy there . But , like many country houses , it is in the summer that Highgrove is at its best . Inside the house the polished wood floors reflect the work that has gone into them . Outside , the Prince 's walled garden is in bloom , and there is the chance to use the swimming pool . Prince William also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Smokey . The winter can sometimes be bleak , and occasionally fog can prevent the Queen 's flight helicopter from landing or taking off , and the Prince and Princess have to switch to cars to get to their engagements on time . The family has gotten used to the red royal helicopters landing where the horses were grazing only a few hours before . The two young Princes sometimes cone out to wave good-bye to their mother or father as they fly off to work . The Princess is always most careful not to let the children near the helicopter until the rotor blades have stopped . While it is on the ground , the youngsters have had the chance to sit in the pilot 's and navigator 's seats ? as has the Princess herself . During normal flights , the royal travelers are in a self-contained compartment , unable to see into the cockpit . But in July the Princess was given the chance to see what it is like up front . - After being given an aerial view of the house and surrounding area , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many pools in Tetbury . But her world stretches far beyond the swimming pools . It is a world that demands patience , stamina , and application ? and sheer planning . Behind the Scenes Organizing the lives of the Prince and Princess of Wales and making the whole operation run well is full-time work for about 40 people . In addition there are hundreds , perhaps even thousands , who help to make their engagements and foreign tours a success . The head of their household is their private secretary , and under him , a deputy private secretary . Only two of the present royal household have been in their jobs longer than a year . It is the people in the real front line who have stayed longest . Miss Anne Beckwith-Smith has been lady-in-waiting to the Princess since 1981 . A ladyin-waiting helps out at engagements by , say , collecting the flowers presented to the Princess . But Miss Beckwith-Smith does much , much more . She is the Princess 's closest adviser and friend . Deeply loyal to her employer , nobody has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would want to do and not want to do . Every year hundreds of invitations arrive at the Prince of Wales 's Office in Buckingham Palace and the office staff first sift through these invitations . They look to see which are from charities , trusts , and causes that the Prince or Princess are particularly interested in ; which are from parts of the country they want to visit or already plan to visit ; and which fit into the royal timetable , which already has portions blocked off for important events ( such as a state visit ) and for such traditional royal holidays as Christmas at Windsor Castle , the New Year at Sandringham , and August at Balmoral Castle in Scotland . The invitations that are passed on after this process are presented to the Prince . Those he approves are then put before a program meeting held twice a year in the dining room at Kensington Palace . Round the table are represented all the aspects of the Prince 's life ? from policy to polo . Prince William sometimes pops in on his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check that there are no clashes between the proposed arrangements and any other plans , and to see which of the Prince 's engagements the Princess plans to attend as well . Throughout the meeting the Princess consults with Anne Beckwith-Smith , and they take notes so that afterward , when they know which dates are still free , they can begin filling the Princess 's diary of engagements . Once an engagement has been decided , the organizers are informed and a date is fixed for a " recce , " a reconnoiter of the event by the private secretary , his assistant , an equerry , or for some of the Princess 's events , Anne BeckwithSmith . On the " recce " the Palace team will want to know every detail of what is expected of the royal couple , and will be asked for advice ? on how they should be addressed ( as Your Royal Highness , Sir , or Ma'am ) , and how they should be greeted ( curtsying and bowing are not compulsory ) . They will be asked what kind of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own chefs on these tours ) , and what kind of drink they like ( wine is acceptable ) . The local organizers will also be reminded that great care must be taken not to allow the press to photograph the Prince and Princess eating or drinking . The Princess in particular will need to know if there are any traditions about forms of dress that she should observe . In the preparations for any foreign tour her dressers are crucial in helping to work out how many suitcases will be needed and when and where . The Prince 's valets will be doing the same for him . They will then tell the Prince and Princess 's baggage master who will work out how to move the luggage from place to place , who will collect it at the airport , how much will be moved into the official residence and unpacked , and how much is to be left packed for the next stop . Only then is the royal road-show ready to roll . On royal tours the household have always set up shop somewhere , normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary clerical work , and stay in touch with Buckingham Palace . In 1985 and 1986 , the mobile computerized office arrived . Word processors are now taken on the road . Also in the office is a machine that can send documents to and from Buckingham Palace . It is also used to send to the tour-party extracts from the day 's London newspapers . The newspapers themselves arrive on the next airplane out , along with any highly confidential documents for the Prince . There is even special writing paper , with the heading The Royal Party on Tour , on which the thank-you letters are typed . In a fast-moving tour from city to city some of the greatest stress is on the valets and dressers . They sometimes spend most of the night packing and unpacking . And when the royal party boards the airplane , there is sometimes a last-minute scramble . Perhaps the most frantic stopover of this past year was during the flight from London to Austria . The Princess boarded the flight at Heathrow and flew to northern Italy in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiday , sketching . The stop at Milan , Italy , was a " racing " one , with the plane 's engines left running and no time to open the baggage hold . It was not the most elegant of  | royal departures , but the speed enabled the couple to arrive for their engagement in Austria on time . The Working Couple on Tour Anybody arriving at Fiji airport at dawn one morning in October 1985 would have been surprised to find the heir to the British throne in casual clothes , pacing up and down the runway , stretching his legs after a 23-hour flight from London , and his wife in a slightly crumpled blouse and skirt , standing at the top of the steps , rubbing the sleep out of her eyes . This stay in Fiji was just a refueling stop on the way to the royal tour of Australia . After the Prince returned to the plane , the Princess walked down to the tarmac to chat with her staff . The Governor-General of Fiji , hearing that she was there , could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were satisfactory for the one-hour official visit the couple was due to make on their way back from Australia . Being a proper GovernorGeneral , he was wearing a traditional Fijian outfit ? which is how it came about that the Princess and he stood on an airport tarmac wearing skirts of exactly the same length . Thirty-three hours out of London , the airplane touched down in Melbourne . Once it had landed , all those who would follow the Prince and Princess down the steps began to file into the royal compartment . But nobody disembarked until the Australian pestcontrol officer had walked the length of the airplane , spraying royals and commoners alike . The Princess was keen to get out of the aircraft after the long flight and get the tour under way . " Let 's go , let 's go , " she said . The Prince , who has been visiting Australia since he was at school at Melbourne 's Geelong Grammar , just stayed in his seat until the official " off . " After a thank-you to the crew , the Princess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told , " You go first . " They walked down the steps into the spring sunshine of Australia , and the royal visit had begun . The tour was a great success , but it was the unexpected fashion notes that livened up the press coverage of it . The Princess surprised everybody by turning up at a charity ball with an emerald necklace , a wedding gift from the Queen , as a headband . Press reports said it was because of sunburn on her neck . Nobody asked whether the tiara that she had been due to wear could not be found that evening . At home or on tour the royal breakfast is made by butler Harold Brown . His tray of cereals , tea , and a flower is the same wherever they go . For the Princess , further continuity comes from her hairdresser , Richard Dalton . The time the Princess spends having her hair done is also a chance to chat before the official work ahead . On Melbourne Cup day all over Australia people organize sweepstakes ; there was one in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their horses were soon out of the running , but one of the royal detectives said that he had picked the winner . " You can take us all out to dinner , " the Princess joked . In faCt dinner had already been arranged . It went smoothly until a small , unexpected hitch on the way up to bed . After saying good night , the Princess caught her tiara on her dress and had to stop on the staircase and untangle it . The moment was shared with the ten people at the bottom of the stairs , and a few million watching on television a year later , when that part of the tour was shown to the public . After the Australian tour the Prince and Princess visited Honolulu , Washington , D.C. , and Palm Beach , Fla . Later in the year they also went to Canada and Japan . It was in Vancouver , Canada , that  | one of the biggest stories of the year for royal-watchers occurred ? the Princess 's fainting fit . Considering the large press corps that follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a miracle ( or a disaster , depending on your point of view ) that all that exists of the incident is a television shot of the Princess being helped away , but still on her feet . In fact she never did touch the ground ; one of her aides saw that she was about to go and , in a combined effort with the Prince of Wales , caught her in time . Not surprisingly , it all sparked off more talk of the Princess 's not eating enough and the tour 's being too tiring . Though this episode hurt her selfconfidence for a time , it did not ruin the tour of Japan that followed . The visit still holds very happy memories for the Prince and Princess . In the short tour lasting only a few days , the couple saw tea ceremonies , sumo wrestling , Buddhist temples , flower-arranging , and they tried Japanese food and kimonos . And in the occasional moments of relaxation when the Prince was alone except for his detective , he took advantage of the peace and quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Princess 's workload has grown . In 1985 she undertook 299 public duties , compared with 177 the year before , when Prince Henry was born . Of her 206 engagements carried out in Britain , 106 were on her own . The Prince , who not so long ago was being accused of losing interest in such duties , carried out 404 engagements in 1985 , compared with 316 in 1984 . The other change in the Princess 's work has been the increased number of speeches she has made . Her first two speeches as Princess were very brief affairs and both were delivered nervously and quickly . In the spring of 1986 the Princess 's speeches were marked by a slower delivery and cooler complexion ? and deep sighs of relief once they were over . Lately she visited a number of drugtreatment centers and talked with addicts and those trying to help them . The Princess 's growing self-confidence allows her to talk freely with people without fear of saying the wrong thing . Those close to her have noticed the continuing change from the so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People After a foreign tour or a busy round of engagements in Britain , the Prince of Wales likes to sit in his walled garden at Highgrove . He says that he has put his heart and soul into creating it and he finds it " enormously enjoyable . " When the Prince bought the house in 1980 , the walled garden was rather basic , with black cinder paths , many vegetables , but few flowers , and a hole in one wall where somebody had made a gap to get a tractor through . The Prince says that he had always wanted to create something special in a walled garden : " I 'd always wanted to grow fruit , flowers , and vegetables in one place . " Today he loves going to the garden and puttering around , sitting and reading . " As far as Highgrove is concerned , there was basically nothing there when I arrived , and so it has been a great challenge to create something , " he says . " It would be different , I think , if you arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could only make it worse . " I love the business of planting my own plants and trees : I 've done most of the planting there , with the help of my team , and as a result they 're like , in a sense , one 's own children . I go round and I examine them very carefully and see how they 're getting on and occasionally talk to them , which I think is very important ? they do respond in a funny way . And of course if they die , I feel deeply saddened . But it 's a remarkable thing that I did n't realize I would develop because it was only when I had my own place that I actually became interested in it ? even the weeding . " At present the garden is very much the Prince 's own domain , and he has yet to see which child takes to gardening . When they are older , he says he may set aside a gardening area for them . Another of his great interests is polo . He spends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is on tour tries to fit in a game on some foreign field . To let him just turn up and ride different polo ponies , his polo manager , Major Ronald Ferguson spends a few days before each match abroad testing the best available ponies in the area . ( His friendship with the Prince goes back many years , long before the Major 's younger daughter married Prince Andrew . ) " There are many ponies that bounce around and throw you out of the saddle , destroying all chances of a happily married existence if you 're not careful , " the Prince says . The Prince explains that his whole approach to life is to keep himself at least at minimum fitness . " I can then suddenly go off and have a game of polo somewhere in the world , or climb a mountain , or go for a wind surf , or something energetic . I try to do exercises every day and not eat too much so that I can do these things that I enjoy . If I ca n't get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I mean . " The Princess 's way of avoiding " clogging up " is swimming and dancing . She showed her skills to a select audience when she danced at a Sunday concert at the Royal Opera House . The Princess takes dancing lessons in London and sometimes goes to watch ballet rehearsals . She has gotten to know many of the dancers at the London City Ballet , and as well as watching them rehearse , she likes to sit with them afterward , drinking a paper-cup of coffee from a machine and chatting about the problems and pleasures of being a ballet dancer . This , then , was the way the Prince and Princess spent the past year . A lot of work , balanced with family time and private pleasure ? and , of course , time spent planning for the equally busy year to come .
