Out of control and no limits in sight <P> The scene was shocking , but it was an aptly ironic image of the times . A winner of the Nobel Peace Prize shot by soldiers-his own-wielding Soviet AK-47s ( market price : $750 ) , who had jumped from a Soviet Zil truck ( price : $18,000 ) that was towing a North Korean antitank gun ( $35,000 ) . In the background American-made M60 battle tanks ( $2 million each ) rumbled on in the parade of Egyptian military might , while six French Mirage jet fighters ( $2.5 million ) flew overhead in tight formation . <P> Across the Islamic world , from Tripoli to Tehran , the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat was celebrated by bursts of bullets from every revolutionary 's favorite automatic weapon . More than 10 million AK-47s , designed by Mikhail Kalashnikov , are now in circulation throughout the world . <P> And in the wake of Sadat 's murder , how was tribute paid to the memory of this man ?

" No longer content with surplus materiel from the arsenals of the superpowers , smaller nations are demanding state-of-the-art equipment in everything from fighters to frigates . Even as they deplore the buildup and fear its consequences , the major arms sellers echo the old dirge of 19th century slave traders : " If we do n't sell , someone else will . " The only effective restraint on the seller , it seems , is the difficulty in beating competitors to the most lucrative contracts . <P> Not only nations are being armed . Inevitably , weapons flow into the hands of self-proclaimed freedom fighters , terrorists and fanatics and , alas , the children whose legacy it is to be born into a world of arms .
