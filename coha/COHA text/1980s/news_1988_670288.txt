No Need to Worry , Doctors Do Just Fine DOCTORS ARE a bit defensive about their pay these days . And for good reason : Third-party payers are united in their desire to " reform " ( translation : limit ) physicians ' pay . Although some doctors argue their salary increases have barely kept pace with inflation over the past several years , a new survey shows most physicians still enjoy a healthy income . Medical Economics magazine says the average physician made $116 , 440 in 1987 , an increase of 3. 2% from 1986 . ( The Consumer Price Index rose 4. 4% over the same period . ) The top earners are cardiovascular surgeons , who earn an average of $271 , 550 . Bringing up the rear are general practitioners , who make an average of $79 , 910 . Neurosurgeons had the biggest average increase in salary last year  --  up 16% to $236 , 460  --  while plastic surgeons had the biggest drop  --  down 0. 6% to $179 , 170 .

Several states now require small firms to provide health coverage for workers . Oregon , however , has come up with a way to make the idea more palatable to these companies . On Nov. 1 , Oregon will become the first state to offer tax credits to small businesses that voluntarily provide health coverage for employees . Companies with 25 or fewer employees that participate in the program will receive a monthly credit of $25 per worker . Oregon has some 400 , 000 residents without health insurance  --  about 235 , 000 of them in firms covered by the credit , says Michael McCracken , director of the Governor ' s Commission on Health Care . " There is the risk businesses will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In that case , the legislature may have to look at making the program mandatory . " Joe Gilliam , assistant to the director at the Salem , Ore. , office of the National Federation of Independent Businesses , says small businesses in the state are enthusiastic about the program . In a survey of the federation ' s 13 , 500 members in Oregon , 86% of respondents said they would offer health insurance to employees if tax credits were available . Although the tax credits will cover only about half the cost of the premiums , Mr. Gilliam says , that ' s enough to enable many businesses to afford coverage . Cutting the Costs Of Disabled Workers MORE BUSINESSES are setting up programs to rehabilitate disabled workers . In doing so , companies hope to cut the costs of long-term care as well as help disabled employees resume productive lives . " The idea is that everyone will win , " says Amy Gottlieb , a research specialist at Human Resources Center in Albertson , N.Y. , a nonprofit rehabilitation center . In the past , employers often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an executive at Northwestern National Life Insurance Co. in Minneapolis , companies face a dilemma : The work force is aging , which results in more disabilities , but the pool of young replacement workers is shrinking . Patsy Clemons , benefits administrator for Houston-based Baker Hughes Inc. , an oil-field service and mining company , cites the example of a 38-year-old field worker who suffered a herniated disk . Unable to work at oil sites , the man is now enrolled in school in a two-year electronics program . In comparing the cost of the school to the cost of a disability trust fund that would have run to age 65 , Mrs. Clemons estimates that the company will save almost $60 for every $1 spent on rehabilitative training . Hospital Pays Price For Reprimanding Nurse HOSPITALS MAY think twice before reprimanding a well-intentioned nurse . In August , a jury in Los Angeles Superior Court awarded $114 , 000 in damages and lost wages to Sandra Bardenilla , 39 , a former nursing supervisor at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Harbor City , Calif . Ms. Bardenilla sued the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resign because she had questioned a doctor ' s decision to disconnect a life-support system from a comatose patient . " Nurses have traditionally been in a pretty powerless situation , " Ms. Bardenilla says . " I think this is a moral victory for me and , I hope , for other nurses . " The conflict began in the summer of 1981 . Ms. Bardenilla says she objected to the physician ' s order because the hospital lacked clear guidelines for treating comatose patients . After she found another doctor to change the order , Ms. Bardenilla says she was ordered to apologize to the original physician and was stripped of most of her authority . Refusing to apologize , Ms. Bardenilla says she was harassed and ostracized at the hospital and felt she had to resign . In court , Kaiser argued that it wasn ' t liable because Ms. Bardenilla wasn ' t fired . But the jury disagreed . Three weeks ago , Kaiser said it would not appeal the verdict.               @ @ @ @ @ @
