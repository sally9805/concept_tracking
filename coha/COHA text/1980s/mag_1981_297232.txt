AMBITION : THE SECRET PASSION by Joseph Epstein ; Dutton ; 312 pages ; $13.95 <P> Joseph Epstein , editor of the American Scholar and a member of North western 's English department , defines ambition as the fuel of achievement . Ben Franklin was an OPEC of success in the 18th century . Pierre du Pont never ran dry ; neither did John D. Rockefeller , Henry Ford , Joseph Kennedy or Henry R. Luce . Epstein tips his mortarboard to these classic American gogetters . In a series of biographical sketches , he admires their energy and single-mindedness and the uncomplicated relish they took in pursuing knowledge , wealth and power . He understands the influences that gave their ambitions strength and direction : the Enlightenment and flowering of scientific curiosity ; the Puritan ethic that placed religion in the service of profit ; a vision of industrial progress that would free men from donkey work ; a dream of dynasty in which rewards would be passed on to multiply through the efforts of one 's sons . <P> These verities are now riddled with doubts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Epstein argues , business success is looked down on as a bit tacky . In England and America , he says , it is fashionable to think small , though not necessarily to live that way . There is now an odor of hypocrisy in the air , notes Epstein , particularly among " authors of books deploring affluence who regularly call their editors for up-to-the-minute royalty statements ; Marxist professors with two Volvos in the driveways of their summer homes . Esquire , whose pages spill over with advertisements for cars , clothes , travel and other worldly treasure , runs an article on the pleasures of downward mobility . " <P> The game for many no longer seems worth the effort ; careers and families are no longer standard equipment but options . Epstein goes further : " All this suggests a people that has lost its way , its energy , its dreams-in a word , its ambition . " <P> There are enough opinion polls and man-on-the-street interviews to affirm this generalization . The rise in T shirt aggression and bumper-sticker bravado reflects an increase in frustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less true for having become cliches : <P> the demoralizations of Viet Nam and Watergate ; the humiliations of being outproduced by former enemies and overcharged by a Third World cartel ; the inflation that has narrowed the road to middle-class affluence . <P> <P> Epstein suggests that this age of sub-compact expectations has other causes . <P> They include the state , which has usurped most of the capital-accumulating and distributing functions of the old industrial upper class , the decline of distinguished families like the Adamses , and a sustained attack on worldly success by novelists and intellectuals . " Antisuccess , " he says , " has been perhaps the strongest strain in American literature of the past half-century . And to be against success is to put ambition itself in grave doubt .
