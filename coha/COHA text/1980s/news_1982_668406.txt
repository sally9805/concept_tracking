Michael A.V. Ward has a notion that a proper automobile is one with no catalytic converters , no microprocessors and no harmful emissions , just a simple piston engine with a simple carburetor . If he and his company are successful , tomorrow ' s car won ' t have a cooling system , either . It will have the heart of a microwave oven under its hood , though . Oh , yes . It will also have plasma ignition . All Ward needs at the moment is money , so he ' s conducting a stock sale . Dr. Ward ( he has a PhD ) is a physicist who has spent time at the University of Iowa and Harvard and Rutgers universities . His engine concepts may not be all that far-fetched , but his company as an investment is fraught with risk , to say the least . Ward is the chief asset of Combustion Electromagnetics Inc. , an undercapitalized research-and-development company with no revenue , few assets and an accumulated deficit . CEI operates out of a plain building on Prentiss road , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Raise some more capital via the stock offering ; market an automotive aftermarket consumer product to establish cash flow ; build a prototype engine and - maybe - find success in the auto business by licensing or building automobile powerplants that are simple , clean and fuel efficient . The product Ward wants to market is a pulse-ignition system for conventional automobile engines . Reduced to simple terms , his ignition system uses electronics to produce rapid-fire sparks instead of a single spark . Cranking the engine during startup would give the device time enough to unleash up to 400 microsparks to fire the fuel mixture ; at high engine speeds , two or three sparks would be generated . The advantage of pulse ignition is a more reliable ignition in a lean fuel-air mixture , hence a cleaner burn ( fewer emissions ) and more efficient combustion ( minor fuel savings ) . There are such devices on the market now and they do sell . Ward says he can produce his device at a competitive price ( about $300 retail ) , and his will be better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he will have achieved Step 1 in The Plan - cash flow . The engine Ward envisions is an adiabatic engine , that is , an internal combustion engine in which there is minimal heat exchange between the cylinders and the external environment . Ideally it would not need a cooling system . Theoretically , an adiabatic gasoline engine is impossible . Ward says , however , that microwave excitation of the fuel mixture makes it all very possible . Microwaves in the combustion chamber , Ward says , will allow ignition of a gasoline-air mixture so lean that it would normally not burn ; it would be considered below the threshold of flammability . An extremely lean mixture , in turn , means a very low combustion temperature , low enough , he hopes , to eliminate the need for a cooling system and to eliminate oxides of nitrogen ( NOx ) as a pollutant . Today ' s engines are designed for low NOx and high hydrocarbon emission ; the hydrocarbons are cleaned up by the catalytic converter , an expensive afterburner which depends upon platinum . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held within a very narrow range , less than 1 percent error , Ward says , by means of microprocessors . That and the converter add up to a lot of money . A $12 " magnetron " to produce microwaves coupled to Ward ' s engine wouldallow the car manufacturer to shed more than $1200 worth of converter and microchips . Ward says he has had successful ignition in mixtures as lean as 33 parts air to 1 part fuel with the aid of microwaves - far leaner than the recognized " ideal " of 14.7 to 1 . Beaming microwaves into the cylinder is a simple matter , he says . A magnetron can be mounted safely in a grounded box on the firewall of the engine compartment and the radiation transmitted to the cylinder directly by coaxial cable , the same kind of cable that is used to transmit television signals . The plasma jet ignition is intended to ensure good ignition with a very lean burn mix , Ward says . It sounds space age , but it is simple , he insists . Plasma is hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plasma ignition involves getting a high-energy spark where only a low- energy spark was possible before . Ignition spark is produced by running a high-energy , low-tension current through a primary winding and inducing the flow of a low- energy , high-tension current in a secondary winding . The high- tension current is able to jump the spark plug gap where a low- tension current wouldn ' t . In his plasma ignition , as soon as the spark is created in the cylinder , the primary current is shunted through it giving a very high energy blob of a spark - plasma , Ward says . Ward has demonstrated microwave-enhanced , lean burn combustion in a " combustion bomb , " he says , which means it works in the laboratory . The plasma ignition is working in a test auto which is there for the looking . The pulse ignition is a visible product . But it remains to be seen whether the laboratory experiment will translate to a working engine - an operating piston in a cylinder running an automobile . That ' s why Ward needs capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
