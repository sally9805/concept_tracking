deoxyribonucleic acid , better known as DNA , was a molecule , shaped like a twisted , double-stranded string . It was made up of repeating subunits called bases that had the property of pairing with each other in very specific ways . Particular areas of the DNA were called genes , and each gene was associated with the production of a specific protein . Jason felt encouraged as he took a sip of his wine . The book was well written and made the subject matter seem clear . He liked the little tidbits like the fact that each human cell had four billion base pairs . The next part of the book dealt with bacteria , and the fact that bacteria reproduce easily and rapidly . Within days , trillions of identicalcells could be made from a single initial cell . This was important , because in genetic engineering bacteria served as the recipient of small fragments of DNA . This " foreign " DNA was incorporated into the bacterium 's own DNA , and then , as the cell divided , it manufactured the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called a recombinant strain and the new DNA molecule was called recombinant DNA . So far so good . Jason ate some of his fish and salad and washed it down with wine . The next chapter got a little more complicated . It talked about how the genes in the DNA molecule went about producing their respectiveproteins . The first part entailed making a copy of the segment of DNA with a molecule called messenger RNA . The messenger RNA then directed the production of the protein in a process called transcription . Jason drank a little more wine . The last part of the chapter got particularly interesting , since it explained the elaborate mechanismsthat turned genes on and off . Getting up from his desk , Jason walked across his living room into the kitchen . Opening the freezer , he poured himself another glass of wine . Back in his study he stared out the window , seeing the lights across the square in St. Margaret 's Convent . It always amused him that there was a convent on the most desirable residential square in Boston : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and move to Louisburg ! Jason smiled , then looked back down at the recombinant DNA book . Sitting down again , he reread the section on the timing of gene expression . It was complicated and fascinating . Apparently , a host of proteins had been discovered that served as repressors of gene function . These proteins attached to the DNA or caused the DNA to coil , to cover up the involved genes.  |p51Jason  closed the book . He 'd had enough for one night . Besides , the section on the control of gene function was what he 'd been unconsciouslylooking for . Reading that section brought back Hayes 's comment that his main interest was " how genes turned on and how they turned off . " Helene had said the same thing but in different words . Taking his wine , Jason wandered into his living room . Absently fondling the cut-glass sconces over the fireplace , he allowed his mind to consider the possibilities . What could Hayes have meant when he said he 'd made a major scientific breakthrough ? For the moment Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all , he was a world-class researcher , and he was working prodigioushours . So there was a chance he 'd been telling the truth . If he 'd made a discovery , it would be in the area of turning genes on and off , and probably have to do with growth and development . The image of the photos of the genitals clouded Jason 's mind for a moment . Jason was brought out of his reverie by the phone . It was the head nurse in the coronary care unit . " Brian Lennox just died . He had a terminal episode of V-tack that progressed to asystole . " " I 'll be right over , " Jason said . He hung up and thought of the nurse 's scientific jargon , recognizing that it was an emotional defense . Once again the shadow of death hung over him like a noxious cloud.  |p52The  radio alarm blasted Jason out of bed . He 'd turned up the volume for fear of oversleeping . He 'd spent a good portion of the night consolingBrian Lennox 's wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaved and showered while his Mr. Coffee performed its usual morning miracle . By the time he was dressed , the apartment was filled with the aromatic smell of the freshly brewed coffee . With mug in hand , he retreated to the den , slipping the Boston Globe out of its protective clear plastic sheath . Planning to turn directly to the sports section , he stopped at a front-page headline  --  DOCTOR , DRUGS AND DANCER . It was not a flattering article about Dr. Alvin Hayes . It played up Hayes 's shockingdeath and unfairly associated it with the drugs found in his apartment , even likening his affair with the dancer to the case involving the Tufts Medical School professor who had been convicted of murderinga prostitute . Along with the article there were two photos : the Time cover shoot of Hayes and another of a woman entering the Club Cabaret , captioned , " Carol Donner entering her place of business . " Jason tried to see what Carol Donner looked like , but it was impossible . She had one hand up , shielding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , TOPLESS COLLEGE GIRLS . Sure , thought Jason with a smile . He read the rest of the article , feeling sorry for Shirley . The police reported that a significant amount of heroin and cocaine was found at the South End apartment that Hayes had shared with Carol Donner . Jason went to the hospital to find his inpatients generally in poor shape . Matthew Cowen , who had had a cardiac catheterization the day before , displayed odd symptoms alarmingly like the late Cedric Harring : arthritis , constipation , and dry skin . None of these wouldp53normally cause Jason much concern . But in view of recent events , they made him feel uneasy . They again brought up the specter of some new unknown infectious disease that he could not control . He had the feeling Matthew 's course was about to change for the worse . After ordering a dermatology consult for Cowen , Jason gloomily went down to his office , where Claudia greeted him with the information that she had pulled the executive physicals through the letter P. She had called the patients and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the charts and opened them . The first one was Holly Jennings , the other Paul Klingler . Both had had their physicalswithin a month . " Call them back , " Jason said , " and ask both to come in as soon as they can without alarming them . " " It 's going to be hard not to upset them . What should I say ? " " Tell them we want to repeat some test . Use your imagination . " Later in the day he decided to see if he could charm some more information on Hayes out of his lab technician , but the moment he saw Helene she made it clear she was not about to be charmed . " Did the police find anything ? " he asked , already knowing the answer was no . Shirley had called him and told him after the police had departed , saying , " Thank God for small favors . " Helene shook her head . " I know you 're busy , " Jason said , " but do you think you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few more questions . " She finally stopped working and turned toward him . " Thank you , " he said , and smiled . Her expression did n't change . It was n't unpleasant , just neutral . " I hate to belabor the subject , " Jason said , " but I keep thinking of what Dr. Hayes said about a significant breakthrough . Are you sure you have no idea what it could be ? It would be tragic if a real medical discovery were lost . " " I told you what I know , " Helene said . " I could show you the latest map he did of chromosome 17 . Would that help ? " " Let 's give it a try . " Helene led the way into Hayes 's office . She ignored the photos that covered the walls , but Jason could n't . He wondered what kind of man could work in such an environment . Helene produced a large sheet of paper covered with minute printing , giving the sequence of base pairs of the DNA molecule comprising a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of base pairs : hundreds and hundreds of thousands . " Dr. Hayes 's area is here . " She pointed to a large section where the pairs were done in red . " These are the genes associated with growth hormone . It 's very complex . " " You 're right there , " Jason said . He knew he 'd have to do a lot more reading to make any sense of it all . " Is there any chance this mapping could have led to a major scientificbreakthrough ? " Helene thought for a moment , then shook her head . " The techniquehas been known for some time . " " What about cancer ? " Jason asked , giving the idea a shot . " Could Dr. Hayes have discovered something about cancer ? " " We did n't work with cancer at all , " Helene said . " But if he was interested in cell division and maturation , it 's possiblehe could have discovered something about cancer . Especially with his interest in the switching on and off of genes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without enthusiasm . Jason was sure that Helene was not being as helpful as she could be . As Hayes 's assistant , she should have had a better idea of what Hayes was doing . But there was no way he could force the issue . " What about his lab books ? " Helene returned to her spot at the lab bench . Opening the second drawer at the table , she pulled out a ledger . " This is all I have , " she said , and handed it to Jason . The book was three-quarters filled . Jason could see it was only a data book without experimental protocols , and without those , the data was meaningless . " Are n't there other lab books ? " " There were some , " Helene admitted , " but Dr. Hayes kept them with him , especially over the last three months . Mostly he kept everything in his head . He had a fabulous memory , especially for figures .. . . " For a brief moment Jason saw a light in Helene 's eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last . She trailed off into silence . She took the data book from Jason and replaced it in its drawer . " Let me ask one other question , " Jason said , struggling over the wording . " As far as you could tell , did Dr. Hayes act normally overp55the last few weeks ? He seemed anxious and overtired when I saw him . " Jason deliberately understated Hayes 's condition . " He seemed normal to me , " said Helene flatly . Oh , brother , Jason thought . Now he was sure Helene was n't being open with him . Unfortunately , there was nothing he could do about it . Thanking her and excusing himself , he retreated from Hayes 's lab . He descended in the elevator , avoided being seen by Sally , crossed to the main building , and rode up to pathology . He found Jackson Madsen in the chemistry lab , where there was a problem with one of the automated machines . Two company reps were there , and Jackson was happy to return to his office with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Wait until you see this , " he said as he positioned a slide under his microscope . He peered through the eyepiece , moving the slide deftly with his thumb and index finger . Then he stepped back and let Jason take a look . " See that vessel ? " he asked . Jason nodded . " Notice the lumen is all but obliterated . It 's some of the worst atherosclerosis I 've seen . That pink stuff looks like amyloid . It 's amazing , especially if you say his EKG was okay . And let me show you something else . " Jackson substituted another slide . " Take a look now . " Jason peered into the microscope . " What am I supposed to see ? " " Notice how swollen the nuclei are , " Jackson said . " And the pink stuff . That 's amyloid for certain . " " What does that mean ? " " It 's as if the guy 's heart was under siege . Notice the inflammatory cells . " Unaccustomed to looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but now they jumped out at him . " What do you make of it ? " he asked . " I 'm not sure . How old did you say this guy was ? " " Fifty-six . " Jason straightened up . " Is there any chance , in your estimation , that we are seeing some new infectious disease ? " Jackson thought for a moment , then shook his head . " I do n't think there 's enough inflammation for that . It looks more metabolic , but that 's all I can say . Oh , one more thing , " he added , putting in another slide . While he focused he said : " This is part of the red nucleus in the brain . Tell me what you see . " He leaned back for Jason . Jason peered into the scope . He saw a neuron . Within thep56neuron was a prominent nucleus as well as a darkly stained granular area . He described it to Jackson . " That 's lipofuscin , " said Jackson . He removed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all mean ? " " Wish I knew , " said Jackson . " All nonspecific , but certainly a suggestion that your Mr. Harring was a sick cookie . These slides could have belonged to my grandfather . " " That 's the second time I 've heard something like that , " said Jasonslowly . " Ca n't you give me anything more specific ? " " I 'm sorry , " said Jackson . " I wish I could be more cooperative . I 'll be running some tests to be sure these deposits in the heart and elsewhere are amyloid . I 'll let you know . " " Thanks , " said Jason . " What about the slides on Hayes ? " " Not ready yet , " said Jackson . Jason returned to the second floor and walked over to the outpatientarea . As a doctor he 'd always had questions about the efficacy of certain tests , procedures and drugs . But he had never had reason to question his general competence . In fact , in most situations he 'd always thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't so sure . Such misgivings were disturbing , especially because he 'd been using work as his major sense of self since Danielle 's death . " Where have you been ? " demanded Sally , catching up to Jason as he tried to slip into his office . Within minutes Sally had Jason buried beneath a host of minor problems that thankfully absorbed his attention . By the time he could catch his breath , it was just after twelve . He saw his last patient , who wanted advice and shots for a trip to India , and then he was free . Claudia tried to get him to join her and some other secretaries for lunch , but Jason declined . He retreated to his office and brooded . The worst part for Jason was the frustration . He felt something was terribly wrong , but he did n't know what it was nor what to do about it . A loneliness descended over him . " Damn , " said Jason , slapping the top of his desk with his open palm , hard enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipping into a depression . He had to do something . Changing from his white coat to his jacket , he grabbed his beeper and descended to his car . He drove around the Fenway , passing the Gardner Museum and then the Museum of Fine Arts on his right . Then , heading southp57on Storrow Drive , he got off at Arlington . His destination was BostonPolice Headquarters . At police headquarters a policeman directed Jason to the fifth floor . As soon as he got off the elevator , he saw the detective coming down the hall , balancing a full mug of coffee . Curran was jacketless , with the top button of his shirt open and his tie loosened . Under his left arm dangled a worn leather holster . When he saw Jason he seemed perplexed until Jason reminded him that they 'd met at the morgue and at BHP . " Ah , yes , " Curran said , with his slight brogue . " Alvin Hayes busi-ness . " He invited Jason into his office , which was starkly utilitarian with a metal desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calendar with the Celtics ' basketball schedule . " How about some coffee ? " Curran suggested , putting his mug down . " No , thank you , " Jason said . " You 're smart , " Curran said . " I know everybody complains about institutional coffee , but this stuff is lethal . " He pulled a metal chair away from the wall and motioned to it for Jason to sit . " So what can I do for you , doctor ? " " I 'm not sure . This Hayes business disturbs me . Remember I told you that Dr. Hayes said he 'd made a major discovery ? Well , now I think there 's a good chance he did . After all , the man was a worldfamousresearcher , and he was working in a field with a lot of poten-tial . " " Wait a minute . Did n't you also tell me you thought Hayes was having a nervous breakdown ? " " At the time I thought he was displaying inappropriate behavior , " Jason said . " I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure . What if he did make a major discovery which he had n't revealedbecause he was still perfecting it ? Suppose someone found out and for some reason wanted it suppressed ? " " And had him killed ? " Curran interrupted patronizingly . " Doctor , you 're forgetting one major fact : Hayes died of natural causes . There was no foul play , no gunshot wounds to the head , no knife in the back . And on top of that , he was dealing . We found heroin , coke , and cash in his Southie pad . No wonder he acted paranoid . The drug scene is a serious world . "  | " Was n't that anonymous tip a bit strange ? " Jason asked , suddenly curious . " It happens all the time . Somebody 's pissed about something so they call us to get even . " Jason stared at the detective . He thought the drug connection was out of character , but did n't know why . Then he remembered that Hayes had been living with an exotic dancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . As if reading Jason 's thoughts , Curran said , " Listen , doctor , I appreciate you taking the time to come down , but facts are facts . I do n't know if this guy made a discovery or not , but let me tell you something . If he was dealing drugs , he was taking them too . That 's the pattern . I had the Vice department run his name through their computers . They came up with zip , but that just means he had n't been caught yet . He 's lucky he got to die of natural causes . In any case , I ca n't justify spending Homicide time on the death . " " I still think there 's more to it . " Curran shook his head . " Dr. Hayes was trying to tell me something , " Jason persisted . " I think he wanted help . " " Sure , " Curran said . " He probably wanted to pull you into his drug ring . Listen , doctor , take my advice . Forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview was over . Descending to the street , Jason removed the parking ticket from his windshield wiper . Sliding in behind the wheel , he thought about his conversation with Detective Curran . The man had been cordial , but he obviously gave little credence to Jason 's thoughts and intuition . As Jason started his car , he remembered something else Hayes had said about his discovery . He 'd said it was " ironic . " Now that was a weird way to characterize a major scientific breakthrough , especially if someone were contriving the story . Back at the GHP , Jason returned to his patients , going from room to room listening , touching , sympathizing , and advising . That was what he loved about medicine . People opened themselves to him , literally and figuratively . He felt privileged and needed . Some of his confidence ebbed back . It was close to four when he approached exam room C and took the chart . He remembered the name . It was Paul Klingler , the man whose physical exam he had done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man appeared to be healthy , with low normal cholesterol and triglycerides and normal EKG . Jason entered the room . Klingler was slender , with sandy blond hair and the quiet confidenceof an old moneyed Yankee . " What was wrong with my tests ? " he asked , concerned . " Nothing , really . " " But your secretary told me you wanted to repeat some . That I had to come today . " " Sorry about that . There was no need for alarm . When she heard you were n't feeling well , she thought we should take a look . " " I 'm just getting over the flu , " Paul said . " Kids brought it home from school . I 'm much better . The only problem is that it has kept me from exercise for over a week . " The flu did n't scare Jason . Healthy people did n't die of it . But he still examined Paul Klingler carefully and repeated the various cardiactests . Finally he told Klingler that he 'd call if the blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confronted Holly Jennings , a **27;15782;TOOLONG from one of the largest Boston advertising firms . She was not happy and certainly not shy about expressing her feelings . And although there was a sign specifically forbidding it , she 'd been smoking in the exam room while she had been waiting . " What the hell is going on ? " she demanded as Jason entered the room . Her physical a month ago had given her a clean bill of health , though Jason had warned her to stop smoking and take off the twenty to thirty extra pounds she had put on in the last five years . " I 'd heard you were n't feeling well , " Jason said mildly . He noticed she looked tired , and saw the dark circles under her eyes . " Is that what this is all about ? " she snapped . " The secretary told me you wanted to repeat some tests. , What was wrong with them ? " " Nothing . We just wanted to do some follow-up . Tell me about your health . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell out of me , making me miss two important presentations , just to have a conversation . Could n't this have been done on the phone ? " " Well , since you 're here , why do n't you tell me how you 've been feeling . " " Tired . "  | " Anything else ? " " Just generally lousy . I have n't been able to sleep . My appetite 's been poor . Nothing specific . . . well , that 's not true . My eyes have been bothering me . I 've had to wear sunglasses a lot , even in the office . " " Anything else ? " Jason asked , feeling an uncomfortable prickle of fear . Holly shrugged . " For some goddamn reason my hair 's been thin-ning . " As carefully as possible , Jason examined the woman . Her pulse and blood pressure were up , although that could have been due to stress . Her skin was dry , particularly on her extremities . When he repeated her EKG , he thought there might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her heart . When he suggested they do another stress test , she declined . " Can I come back for that ? " " I 'd rather do it now , " Jason said . " In fact , would you consider staying in the hospital for a couple of days ? " " Are you kidding ? I do n't have time . Besides , I do n't feel that bad . Why do you even suggest it ? " " Just to get everything done . I 'd like you to see a cardiologist and an ophthalmologist as well . " " Next week . Monday or Tuesday . But I 've got some big dead-lines . " Reluctantly , Jason let Holly go after drawing some blood . There was no way he could force her to stay , and he had nothing specific enough to convince her she was in trouble . It was just a feeling : a bad feeling . Following his usual routine after returning home , Jason jogged , stopped into De Luca 's Market where he got a Perdue chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreated to his den with an icecoldbeer . Making himself comfortable , he continued his reading on DNA . He began to understand how Hayes could isolate specific ' . , genes . That was what Helene Brennquivist had probably been doing that morning . Once an appropriate bacterial colony was found , it was cultivated to produce trillions of bacteria . Then , using enzymes , the bacteria DNA was separated , fragmented , and the desired gene Was isolated and purified . Later , it could be spliced back into differ/ent bacteria into regions of the DNA that could be " switched on " by the researcher . In that form , the recombinant strain of bacteria acted like miniature factories to produce the protein the gene was coded for . It had been this method that Hayes had used to produce his human growth hormone . He had started with a piece of human DNA , the gene that made growth hormone , cloned it by the help of bacteria , then spliced it into bacteria DNA in an area controlled by a gene responsible for digesting lactose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recombinant strain of bacteria had been " turned on " to produce human growth hormone . Jason drained his beer and went into the kitchen and popped another . He was overwhelmed by what he 'd learned . No wonder scientistslike Hayes were strange . They knew they had the power tomanipulate life . This comprehension thrilled Jason and disturbed him at the same time . The DNA technology had awesome potential to do good and harm . The direction , he thought , was a toss-up . Armed with this information , Jason was even more inclined to believe that Hayes , though under general stress , had been telling the truth  --  at least about the scientific breakthrough . Jason was not so sure about Hayes 's statement that someone wanted him dead . He wished he 'd spent more time with the man over the last months . He wished he knew more about him . Opening the oven , Jason checked his chicken . It was browning nicely and looked delicious . He put water on to boil for rice , then went back to the den @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chair , he started the next chapter on the laboratory techniquesof genetic engineering . The first part dealt with the methods by which DNA molecules were fragmented with enzymes called restrictionendonucleases . Jason had to read the section several times . It was difficult material . The shrill whine of the smoke detector startled Jason . Leaping up from the desk where he 'd fallen fast asleep , he dashed into the kitchen . The water for the rice had boiled away , and the Teflon lining was smoking , filling the kitchen with acrid vapors . Jason shoved it under running water , where it spattered and hissed . Turning on the exhaust fan and opening one of the living room windows slowly emptied the kitchen of smoke , and finally the smoke detector fell silent . Jason was glad the landlord was out of town as usual . When his dinner was finally prepared , without rice , Jason carriedp62it to his desk in the den , pushing papers and books aside . As he started eating he found himself looking at the front of the Boston Globe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " staring him in the face . Picking the paper up in his left hand , he looked at Carol Donner again . The idea that Hayes would have been living with the woman confounded him . Jason wondered if Hayes had fallen prey to the age-old male fantasy of rescuing the prostitute who , despite her work , had a heart of gold . Thinking of Hayes as a colleague with similar background including the same medical school , Jason found the idea of him falling for such a cliche farfetched . But as Curran had said , facts were facts . Obviously Hayes had been living with the girl . Jason tossed the paper aside . After reading what he could find about dry skin , which was n't much , Jason carried his soiled dishes to the kitchen and rinsed them . The image of Carol Donner with her hand in front of her face kept popping up in his mind . He looked at his watch . It was ten-thirty . " Why not , " he said aloud . After all , if Hayes had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could give Jason a clue about Hayes 's breakthrough . At any rate , he had nothing to lose . Donning a sweater and a tweed jacket , Jason left the apartment . From Beacon Hill it was only a fifteen-minute walk to the Combat Zone . But fifteen minutes took Jason an enormous social distance . Beacon Hill was the epitome of comfortable wealth and propriety , with its cobblestone streets and gas lamps . The Combat Zone was the sordid opposite . To get there , Jason skirted the edge of the Boston Common , reaching Washington Street with its row of bottomless bars by way of Boylston Street . There were roaming packs of street people mixing uneasily with groups of boisterous students and leather jacketed blue-collar workers from Dorchester . The Club Cabaret was in the middle of the block , nestled between an X-rated cinema and an adult bookstore with a variety of supposed sexual aids on display in its window . The TOPLESS COLLEGE GIRLS sign glowed with fluorescent paint . Jason walked up to the door and went inside . He found himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center to spotlight a wooden runway . The bar itself was U-shaped and surrounded the runway . Behind there were small booths , and rock music thudded into the room from large speakers flanking the stairs that led to the runway from the floor above.  |p63The  air was foul with cigarette smoke and that peculiar chemical odor which smells like cheap room-deodorant . The place was almost filled with men hunched over drinks at the bar . It was difficult to see into the booths , but as Jason passed , he glimpsed numerous women in low-cut spaghetti-strap dresses . He found a stool at the bar . A waitress wearing a white shirt and tight black shorts took his order almost instantly . As she brought his beer and a glass , a seminude dancer came down the stairs and pranced along the runway . Jason gazed up at her , catching her eye for a brief instant . She looked bored . Her face was heavily made up , and her bleached hair had the consistency of straw . Jason guessed her age to be over thirty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed equivalent expressions of boredom on the faces of the men as their eyes reflexively followed the progress of the dancer up and down the runway . Jason sipped his beer from the bottle . There was no way he 'd allow his lips to touch a glass in that place . When the rock-and-roll piece ended , the dancer acted as if she 'd been momentarily stranded . Self-consciously , she shifted her weight from one four-inch heel to the other , waiting for the next number . Jason noticed a tattooed heart on her right thigh . Heralded by the heavy beat of drums , the next number began , and the blonde immediately recommenced her gyrations . As she did so , she slipped off her brief top . Now all she had on was a G-string and her shoes . Still , the men at the bar appeared carved in stone . The only movements were those necessary to bring their drinks or cigarettesto their lips . At least until the dancer began moving along the runway . Then a few customers would hold out dollar bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room again . About twenty feet away was a booth occupied by a man in a dark suit with a cigar , studying a ledger through dark glasses . Jason had no idea how the man could see anything at all , but decided he was management . Several body-builder types with eighteen-inch necks , wearing white T-shirts , stood on either side of the booth , their beefy arms crossed and their heads constantly turning to survey the room . As the music ended , the blond stripper picked up her things and ran up the stairs . There was scattered applause . When the music began again , a new dancer descended the stairs and whirled aboutp64the runway . Dressed in a flashy , voluminous gypsy costume , she could have been the first dancer 's sister  --  her older sister . Very quickly , Jason got the hang of the program . A girl would appear in some wild costume and dance , taking off more of her clothes as the number progressed . Forty-five minutes passed and Jasonwondered if Carol Donner was scheduled to appear that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be next . Want another round , mister ? " Jason shook his head . He was content to nurse his first beer for the entire visit . Looking around , he noticed that several of the strippers had come back down to the floor . They would stop and talk to the man in the dark glasses and then wander around the room , chatting up the customers . Jason tried to imagine Hayes , the famous molecularbiologist , there at the bar . Try as he might , he could n't . There was a pause in the music and the runway lights dimmed . A PA system crackled to life for the first time and announced the next performer : the famous Carol Donner . The bored patrons propped up on the bar suddenly seemed to wake up . There were a few catcalls . The music changed to a softer rock and a figure appeared on the runway . As the lights came up , Jason was stunned . To his amazement , Carol Donner was a beautiful young woman . Her skin had a healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a body suit , headband , and leg warmers as though she were in an aerobics class . Her feet were bare . She moved down the runway with effortless grace , and Jason noticed that her smile held genuine enjoyment . As her number progressed , she removed her leg warmers , a silk sash around her waist , and then the body suit . The sodden audience actually cheered as she danced topless back up the stairs . As soon as she disappeared , the customers sank back into their torpor . Jason kept waiting for Carol to appear on the floor like the other girls , but after twenty minutes he decided she might not . He pushed off his stool and walked back to the man in the sunglasses . One of the bodybuildersnoticed his approach and unfolded his arms . " Excuse me , " Jason said to the man with the ledger . " Would it be possible to talk with Carol Donner ? " The man removed his cigar . " Who the hell are you ? " Jason was reluctant to give his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dark glasses motioned to one of the body-builders . Jason felt large hands take hold of his arm and urge him toward the door . " Ip65only want ... " But he did n't get to say any more . He was grabbed by his jacket and hastily escorted the length of the bar and through the dark curtain , his feet barely touching the floor . With a good deal of humiliation , he found himself propelled out into the street.  |p66After  the radio alarm had awakened him , Jason had to stand under the shower for several minutes to feel capable of facing the day . The night before , after he 'd returned from the unpleasant visit to the Club Cabaret , he 'd been called back to the hospital . One of his AIDS patients , a man named Harvey Rachman , had arrested . When Jason . had arrived , the staff had been giving CPR for fifteen minutes . They 'd kept it up for two hours before conceding defeat . The head nurse 's comment that at least the man did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stricken Jason . For Jason it seemed that death was winning the competition . The only positive side of inpatient rounds later that morning was the discharge of one of his hepatitis cases . Jason was sorry to see the girl go . Now he had only a single patient who was doing well . In the CCU , Matthew Cowen was no better . In addition to his other complaints , he was now having trouble seeing . The symptom bothered Jason . Harring and Lennox had also complained of impairedvision in the weeks before their deaths , and again the possibility of some new multisystem illness crossed Jason 's mind . He orderedan ophthalmology consult . After finishing rounds , Jason headed to pathology to see if the slides from Hayes 's autopsy were done . Maybe they would help explain why so many seemingly healthy people were suffering cardiovascular catastrophe . He had to wait while Jackson called a report on a frozen section down to the OR . It was a breast biopsy and it was positive . " That always makes me feel terrible , " Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more cheerful voice , he added , " I bet you want to see the Hayes slides . " He searched around on his desk until he fo'ind the right folder . Opening it up , he took out a slide and focused it for Jason . " Wait until you see this.  | " That 's Alvin Hayes 's aorta , " Jackson explained as Jason looker in . The cellular death and disorganization were evident even to hi unpracticed eye . " It 's no wonder it blew , " Jackson continued . " I'v never seen such deterioration in anyone under seventy except wit established aortic disease . And let me show you something else . " H replaced the slide with another . " That 's Hayes 's heart . Look at th coronary vessel . It 's like Cedric Harring 's . All the coronary vessel are almost closed . If Hayes 's aorta had n't blown , he 'd have died of heart attack . The man was a walking time bomb . And not only tha he had inflammation in the thyroid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many parallels that I went back and looked at Harring ' aorta . And guess what ? Harring 's aorta was on the verge of blowin too . " " What exactly are you saying ? " Jason asked . Jackson spread his hands . " I do n't know . There are strong similar ities between these two cases . The widespread inflammation but do n't think it 's infectious . It has more the look of autoimmunity , as their immune system had started attacking their own organs . " You mean like lupus ? " " Yeah , something like that . Anyway , Alvin Hayes was in terrib shape . Just about every organ was in a state of deterioration . He wt. falling apart at the seams . " " He said he was n't feeling too well , " Jason said . " Ha ! " Jackson exclaimed . " That 's the understatement of 01 year . " Jason left pathology , trying to make sense of Jackson 's statemen Again he considered the possibility of an unknown infectious disea : despite Jackson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease could work so quickly ? Jason answered his own questioi none . Before starting the office patients , Jason decided to stop Hayes 's lab . Not that he expected Helene to be helpful , but I thought she might be interested in the fact that Hayes had been so i the last few weeks of his life . To his surprise , he saw Helene had bee crying . " What 's the matter ? " Helene shook her head . " Nothing . " " Are n't you working ? " " I finished , " Helene said.  |p68All  at once Jason realized that without Hayes there to give her instructions , she was lost . Apparently she 'd not been apprised of the big picture , a fact that made Jason pessimistic that she would have knowledge of Hayes 's breakthrough , if there 'd been one . The man 's penchant for secrecy was to be society 's loss . " Do you mind if I talk with you for a few minutes ? " Jason asked . " No , " Helene said in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . Jason followed , assaulted once again by the graphic genital photos . " I 've just come from pathology , " Jason began , once they were seated . " Dr. Hayes apparently was a very sick man . Are you sure he did n't complain of feeling ill ? " " He did , " Helene admitted , reversing her previous stand . " He kept saying he felt weak . " Jason stared across at her . She seemed softer , more open , and he realized that in contrast to the previous times he 'd seen her , her hair was loose , falling to her shoulders instead of severely pulled back . " Last time you said his behavior was unchanged , " he said . " It was . But he said he felt terrible . " Frustrated by this semantic distinction , Jason again was convinced that she was covering up something . He wondered why , but he felt he 'd get nowhere by confronting her . " Miss Brennquivist , " Jason said , speaking patiently , " I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no idea what Dr. Hayes could have been referring to when he told me he 'd made a major scientific breakthrough ? " She shook her head . " I really do n't know . The truth was that things had not been going well in the lab . About three months ago , the rats receiving growth hormone  --  releasing factors had mysteriouslybegun to die . " " Where did the releasing factors come from ? " " Dr. Hayes extracted them himself from rat brains . Mostly the hypothalamus . Then I produced them by recombinant DNA tech-niques . " " So the experiments were a failure ? " " Completely , " Helene said . " But , like any great researcher , Dr. Hayes was not daunted . Instead he worked harder . He tried different proteins , but unfortunately with the same fatal results . "  | " Do you think Dr. Hayes was lying when he told me he 'd made a breakthrough ? " " Dr. Hayes never lied , " Helene said indignantly . " Well , how do you explain it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was having a nervous breakdown . Now I 'm not so sure . What do you think ? " " Dr. Hayes was not having a nervous breakdown , " Helene said , rising to make it clear the conversation was over . Jason had hit a raw nerve . She was not about to listen to her late boss be calumniated . Frustrated , Jason went down to his office , where Sally already had two patients waiting for physicals . Between them Jason escaped Sally long enough to check the laboratory values on Holly Jennings . The only significant change from her earlier tests was an elevated gamma globulin , again making Jason consider a non-AIDS-related epidemic involving the autoimmune system . , J. sIoad of turning . the immune , system off , as with AIDS , this problem seemed to turn it on in a destructive fashion . Midmorning Jason got a call from Margaret Danforth , who stated without preamble , " Thought you should know that Dr. Hayes 's urine showed moderate levels of cocaine . " So Curran was right , Jason realized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was related to his claim of discovery , his fear of being attacked , or even his actual death , Jason could n't tell . He was forced to put aside his speculation as the heavy patient load pushed him further and further behind . The pressure was heightened by a call from Shirley , who had apparently learned of his visit to Helene . " Jason , " she said with an edge to her voice , " please do n't stir the pot . Just let the Hayes affair calm down . " " I think Helene knows more than she 's telling us , " Jason said . " Whose side are you on ? " Shirley asked . " Okay , okay , " he said , rudely cutting her off as he was confronted by Madaline Krammer , an old patient who had been squeezed in as an emergency . Up until now her heart condition had been stable . Suddenly she was presenting swollen ankles and chest rales . Despite strong medication , her congestive heart disease had increased in severityto the point that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Madaline protested . " My son is coming from California with his new baby . I 've never seen my granddaughter.  |p70Please  ! " Madaline was a cheerful woman in her mid-sixties with silver-gray hair . Jason had always been fond of her , since she rarely complained and was extraordinarily grateful for his ministrations . " Madaline , I 'm sorry . I would n't do this unless I thought it was necessary . But the only way we can adjust your medications is with constant monitoring . " Grumbling but resigned , Madaline agreed . Jason told her he 'd see her later , and left her in the capable hands of Claudia . By four P.M. , Jason had just about caught up to his appointment schedule . Emergingfrom his office , Jason ran into Roger Wanamaker , whose impressivebulk completely blocked the narrow hallway . " My turn , " Roger said . " Got a minute for a chat ? " " Sure , " said Jason , who never said no to a colleague . He led the way back to his office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just so you do n't feel lonely , " he said . " That 's the chart of a **28;15811;TOOLONG from Data General who was just brought into the emergency room deader than a doorknob . I 'd given him one of our full-scale executive physicals less than three weeks ago . " Jason opened the chart and glanced through the physical , including the EKG and laboratory values . The cholesterol was high but not terrible . " Another heart attack ? " he asked , flipping to the report of the chest X ray . It was normal . " Nope , " Roger said . " Massive stroke . The guy had a seizure right in the middle of a board meeting . His wife is madder'n hell . Made me feel terrible . She said he 'd been feeling crummy ever since he 'd seen us . " " What were his symptoms ? " " Nothing specific , " Roger said . " Mostly insomnia and tension , the kind of stuff executives complain about all the time . " . " What the hell is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Roger said . " But I 'm getting a bad feeling  --  like we 're on the edge of some kind of epidemic or something . " " I 've talked with Madsen in pathology . I asked him about an unknown infectious disease . He said no . He said it was metabolic , maybe autoimmune . " " I think we 'd better do something . What about the meeting you suggested ? " " I have n't called it yet , " Jason admitted . " I 'm having Claudia pullp71all my physicals over the last year and checking to see how the patients are doing . Maybe you should do the same . " " Good idea . " " What about the autopsy on this case ? " Jason asked , handing the chart back to Roger . " The medical examiner has it . " " Let me know what they find . " When Roger left , Jason made a note to call a meeting of the other internists early the following week . Even if he did n't want to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sit back and watch while patients with seemingly healthy checkups ended up in the morgue . En route to his final patient , Jason found himself again thinking of Carol Donner . Suddenly getting an idea , he made a detour to the central desk and found Claudia . He asked her to go down to personneland see if she could get Alvin Hayes 's home address . Jason was confident that if anybody could do it , Claudia could . Once again heading for his last outpatient , Jason wondered why he 'd not thought of getting Hayes 's address sooner . If Carol Donner had been living with the man , it would be vastly easier to talk with her at her apartment than at the Club Cabaret , where they obviously felt rather protective . Maybe she 'd have some ideas about Hayes 's breakthrough , or if nothing else , his health . By the time Jason had finished with his last patient , Claudia had the address . It was in the South End . After all the outpatients had been seen , and Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main elevator to begin his inpatient rounds . He saw Madaline Krammer first . She was already looking better . An increased diuretic had reduced her swollen feet and hands considerably , but when he went over her again he was disturbed to find that her pupils seemed widely dilated and unreactive to light . He made a note on her chart before continuinghis rounds . Before he went in to see Matthew Cowen , Jason pulled his chart to see what the ophthalmology consult had said about his eyes . Shocked , Jason read , " Mild cataract formation in both eyes . Check again in six months . " Jason could n't believe what he was seeing . Cataracts at thirty-five ? He remembered the autopsy had noted cataractsin Connoly 's eyes . He also remembered just seeing Madalinep72Krammer 's dilated pupils . What the hell were they dealing with ? He was further confused when he went down the hall to see Matthew . " Are you giving me any weird drugs ? " he demanded as soon as he glimpsed Jason . " No . Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " To make his point , he tugged on a few strands , which indeed came right out . He scattered them on the pillow . Jason picked one up , rolling it slowly between his thumb and index finger . It looked normal save for a grayness at the root . Then he examined Matthew 's scalp . It too was normal , with no inflammationor soreness . " How long has this been going on ? " he asked , remembering Brian Lennox with startling vividness , as well as Mrs. Harring 's comment that her husband 's hair had started to fall out . " It 's gotten much worse today , " Matthew said . " I do n't mean to sound paranoid , but everything seems to be happening to me . " " It 's just coincidence , " Jason said , trying to buoy his own confidenceas much as Matthew 's . " I 'll have the dermatologist take anotherlook . Maybe it 's associated with your dry skin . Has that im-proved ? " " It 's worse , if anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jason tended to agree , especially since so many of his patients were doing poorly . By the time he finished rounds , he was exhausted . He almost forgot that some well-meaning friends had insisted he attend a dinner party that night so they could fix him up with a cute **25;15841;TOOLONG named Penny Lambert . With an hour to kill , Jason decided it was n't worth going home . Instead , he pulled out the Boston map he kept in his car and located Springfield Street , where Hayes 's apartment was located . It was off Washington Street . Thinkingit would be a good time to catch Carol Donner , he decided to drive directly there . But that was easier said than done . Heading south , he found himself caught in bumper-to-bumper traffic on MassachusettsAvenue . With persistence , he reached Washington Street and turned left , then left again at Springfield . He located Hayes 's building , then found a parking spot . The neighborhood was a mixture of renovated and unrenovated buildings . Hayes 's was in the latter category . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foyer and noted thatp73several of the mailboxes were broken and that the inner door was unlocked . In fact , the lock had been broken sometime in the distant past and never replaced . Hayes 's apartment was on the third floor . Jason started up the poorly lit steps . The smell was musty and damp . The building was large , with single apartments on each floor . On three Jason tripped over several Boston Globes still in their plastic covers . There was no bell so Jason knocked . Hearing no response , he knocked again , harder . The door squeaked open about an inch . Looking down , Jason saw that the lock had recently been forced and that part of the doorjamb was missing . Using his index finger , Jason gingerly pushed the door open . It squeaked again as if in pain . " Hello , " he called . There was no answer . He stepped into the apartment . " Hello . " There was no noise except a running toilet . He closed the door behind him and started across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took one look and almost fled . The place had been trashed The living room , once decorated with attractive antiques and repro . ductions , was a wreck . All the drawers in the desk and sideboard hac been pulled out and dumped . The sofa cushions had been slashed and the contents of a large bookcase were strewn about the floor . Picking his way carefully through the mess , Jason peered into small bedroom , which was in the same condition as the living room then went down the hall to what he assumed was the master bed . room . It too was a wreck . Every drawer had been dumped , and the clothes in the walk-in closet had been ripped from hangers anc thrown on the floor . Picking some up , he noted they were all men ' ; clothes . Suddenly the front door squeaked , sending a shiver down Jason ' ; spine . He let the clothes fall to the floor . He started to call out again hoping that it was Carol Donner , but for a moment he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears straining for sound . Maybe a draf had pushed the door .... Then he heard a thud , like the sound of shoe knocking against a book or an overturned drawer . Someone wa definitely in the apartment , and Jason had the feeling whoever it was knew he was there . Perspiration appeared on his forehead and rat down the side of his nose . Detective Curran 's warning that the drul world was dangerous flashed through his mind . He wondered if there was a way to sneak out . Then he realized he was at the end of a loni hallway.  |p74All  at once a large figure filled the doorway . Even in the darkness Jason could tell that it was carrying a gun . Panic filled Jason as his heart raced . But still he did not move . A second smaller figure joined the first and together they stepped into the room . Then they advanced toward Jason , inexorably , step by step . It seemed like an eternity . Jason wanted to cry out or run.  |p75The  next instant Jason thought he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized it was not the gun , but a light bulb over his head . He was still alive . Two uniformed policemen stood before him . Jason could have hugged them in his relief . " Am I glad to see you guys , " Jason said . " Turn around , " the larger cop ordered , ignoring Jason 's comment . " I can explain . . . " Jason began , but he was told to shut up and put his hands on the wall , his feet spread apart . The second cop searched him , removing his wallet . When they were satisfied Jason was unarmed , they pulled his arms off the wall and handcuffed him . Then they marched him back through the apartment , down the stairs , and into the street . Some passersby stopped to watch as Jason was forced into the back seat of an unmarkedcar . The cops remained silent during the ride to the stationhouse , and Jason decided there was no point trying to explain until they got there . Now that he had calmed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He guessed he 'd be able to make a phone call , and he wondered if he should call Shirley or the lawyer he 'd used when he 'd sold his house and practice . But when they arrived , the cops just marched Jason to a small , bare room and left him there . The door clicked when they went out and Jason realized he was locked in . He 'd never been in jail before and it did not feel good . As the minutes slipped by , Jason realized the gravity of the situation . He remembered Shirley 's request that he not stir the pot . God knows the effect his arrest would have on the clinic if it became public . Finally the door to the room opened and Detective Michael Cur/ran came in , followed by the smaller policeman . Jason was glad to see Curran , but he was immediately aware the detective did not reciprocate the emotion . The lines on his face seemed deeper than ever . " Uncuff him , " Curran said without smiling . Jason stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curran 's face , trying to fathom his thoughts , but he remained impenetrable . " I want to talk with him alone , " he said to the policeman , who nodded and left . " Here 's your goddamn wallet , " Curran said , slapping it into Jason'spalm . " You do n't take advice too well , do you ? What do I have to do to convince you this drug business is serious stuff ' ? " " I was only trying to talk with Carol Donner ... " " Wonderful . So you butt in and screw things up for us . " " Like what ? " Jason asked , beginning to feel his temper rise . " Vice has been staking out Hayes 's apartment since we learned it had been searched . We hoped to pull in someone a bit more interestingthan you . " " I 'm sorry . " Curran shook his head in frustration . " Well , it could have been worse . You could have gotten yourself hurt . Please , doctor  --  would you get back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ? " Jason asked with disbelief . " Yeah , " Curran said , turning to the door . " I 'm not going to book you . No sense wasting our time . " Jason left the police station and took a cab back to Springfield Street , where he retrieved his car . He glanced up at Hayes 's building and shivered . It had been an unnerving experience . With enough adrenaline in his system now to run a four-minute mile , Jason was glad he had plans for the evening . His friends the Alics had invited a lively group of people , and the food and wine were really good . The girl they wanted him to meet , Penny Lambert , struck him as a bit of a yuppie , conservatively dressed in a blue suit with a voluminous silk bow tie . Luckily , she was cheerful and talkativeand willingly filled the gap left by Jason 's inability to stop thinking about Hayes 's apartment and his need to speak to Carol Donner . When coffee and brandy were cleared away , Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penny home , he could persuade her top77stop at Carol 's club . Obviously , Carol was no longer living at Hayes 's apartment , and Jason figured he might have a better chance talking to her if he were accompanied by another woman . Penny happily accepted his offer of a lift , and when they were in the car , he asked her if she were feeling adventurous . " What do you mean ? " she asked cautiously . " I thought you might like to see another side of Boston . " " Like a disco ? " " Something like that , " Jason said . In a mildly perverse way , Jason thought the experience might be good for Penny . She was nice enough , but a bit too predictable . She relaxed , smiling and chatting until they pulled up in front of the Club Cabaret . " Are you sure this is a good idea ? " she asked . " Come on , " Jason urged . He 'd given her a little background en route , explaining that he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Penny had remembered the story from the newspapers and it had not buoyed her confidence , but with a bit more cajoling he persuaded her to let him park and go in . Friday was obviously a big night . Gripping Penny 's hand , Jason worked his way down the room , hoping to avoid the man with the dark glasses and his two he-man bodyguards . With the help of a fivedollarbill he got one of the waitresses to give them a booth against the side wall , several steps up from the floor . They could see the runway while remaining partially concealed from the dancers by the dark silhouettes of men standing two deep at the bar . They 'd entered between numbers . They had just ordered drinks when the speakers roared to life . Jason 's eyes had adjusted to the darkness , and he could just make out Penny 's face . What he could see best were the whites of her eyes . She was n't doing much blinking . A stripper appeared in a swirl of diaphanous crepe . There were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waitress for their drinks , Jason asked if Carol Donner was dancing that night . The waitress said her first set was at eleven . Jason was relieved  --  at least she had n't been trashed along with Hayes 's apartment . When the waitress left he saw the dancer was down to her G-string and that Penny 's lips were tightly pursed . " This is disgusting , " she spat . " It 's not the Boston Symphony , " Jason agreed . " She even has cellulite . "  |p78Jason  looked more carefully when the dancer went back up the stairs . Sure enough , the backs of her thighs were heavily dimpled . Jason smiled . It was curious what a woman noticed . " Are these men really enjoying themselves ? " Penny asked with distaste . " Good question . I do n't know . Most of them look bored . " But not one was bored when Carol came out . Like the night before , the crowd came alive when she began her routine . " What do you think ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I ca n't believe your friend was involved with her . " " That 's exactly what I thought , " Jason said . But now he was n't so sure . Carol Donner projected a very different personality than he had expected . After Carol finished , and again did not appear among the patrons , Jason had had enough . Penny was eager to leave , and Jason noticed she had little to say on the way home . He guessed the Club Cabaret had n't made a great impression . When he left her at her door , he did n't even bother to say he 'd call . He knew the Alics would be disappointed , but he figured they should have known better than to fix him up with a bow tie . Back in his own apartment , Jason undressed and picked up the DNA book from the den . He got into bed and started reading . Rememberinghis exhaustion that afternoon , he thought he 'd drop off to sleep quickly . But that was n't the case . He read about bacteriophages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were used in genetic engineering . Then he read a chapter on plasmids , which he 'd never even heard of before he 'd started reading about DNA . He marveled that plasmids were small circular DNA moleculesthat existed in bacteria and reproduced faithfully when the bacteria reproduced . They , too , served an enormously important function as vehicles for introducing segments of DNA into bacteria . Still wide awake , Jason looked at the time . It was after two A.M. , and sleep was out of the question . Getting up , he went into his living room and stared out at Louisburg Square . A car pulled up . It was the tenant who occupied the garden apartment in Jason 's building . He , too , was a doctor and although they were friendly , Jason knew little about the man other than he dated a lot of beautiful women . Jason wondered where he found them all . True to form , the man emergedp79from his car with an attractive blonde and amid soft laughter disappearedout of sight below . Jason heard the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not get Carol Donner out of his mind , wishing he could speak with her . Looking at the clock on the mantel , Jason had an idea . Quickly , he returned to the bedroom , redressed , and went out to his car . With some misgivings about the possible consequences , Jason drove back to the Combat Zone . In contrast to the rest of the city , it was still very much awake . He drove past the Club Cabaret once , then circled and backed into a side street and parked . He switched off the motor . There were some unsavory types lingering in doorways and on the side street who made Jason feel uncomfortable . He made sure all his doors were locked . Within a quarter hour of his arrival , a large group of people emerged from the club and went their separate ways . About ten minutes later , a group of dancers appeared . They chatted together in front of the club , then split up . Carol was not among them . Just when Jason had begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one of the body-builders . He wore a leather jacket over his T-shirt , but it was not zipped up . They turned right , heading up Washington Street toward Filene 's . Jason started his car , unsure of what to do . Luckily there was plenty of traffic , both cars and pedestrian . To keep Carol in sight , he nudged out into the street , staying to theside . A policeman saw him and waved him on . Carol and her friend turned left on Boylston Street , walked into an open parking lot , and got into a large black Cadillac . Well , at least he 'll be easy to keep in sight , Jason thought . But , never having followed anyone , he discovered it was n't as easy as he 'd imagined , especially if he did n't want to be observed . The Cadillac skirted the edge of the Common , went north on Charles Street , then made a left on Beacon , passing the Hampshire House . Several blocks later , the car pulled over to the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area of town called Back Bay , composed of large , turn-of-the-century brownstones , most of which had been converted into rental units or condos . Jason passed the Cadillac as Carol alighted . Slowing , he watched in the rearview mirror as she ran up the steps of a building with a large bay window . Jason turned left on Exeter , then left on Marlborough . After waiting about five minutes ,  |p80he  rounded the block . Arriving back on Beacon Street , he looked for the black Cadillac . It was gone . Jason parked in front of a fire hydrant half a block from Carol 's building . At three A.M. Back Bay was peaceful  --  no pedestrians and only an occasional passing car . Turning into the walk leading to Carol 's building , Jason surveyed the six-story facade and saw no lights in any of the windows . Entering the building 's outer foyer , he scanned the names opposite the buzzers . There were fourteen . To his disappointment there was no Donner listed . Stepping back outside , Jason debated what he should do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he walked around the block , counting the buildings until he located Carol 's . There was a light in the window on the fourth floor . He guessed that had to be Carol 's since it was unlikely anyone else would be up . Intending to go back to the entrance and press the appropriate buzzer , Jason turned and headed back up the alley . He saw the lone figure immediately , but he kept walking , hoping the man would merely pass by . As the distance between them closed , Jason 's steps slowed , then stopped . To his dismay he realized it was the bodybuilder . His leather motorcycle jacket was unzipped , showing a white T-shirt stretched tight across powerful muscles . It was the same individual who had thrown him out of the Club Cabaret the night before . The man kept coming at Jason , his fingers flexing in apparent anticipation . Jason guessed him to be in his mid-twenties , with a full face that suggested he took steroids . It obviously spelled trouble . And Jason 's hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growled , " What the fuck you doing , creep ? " That was all Jason needed . He spun on his heels and started for the other end of the alley . Unfortunately , his leather-soled loafers were no competition for the body-builder 's Nikes . " You goddamn pervert ! " he shouted , pulling Jason to a stop . Jason ducked a roundhouse left hook and grabbed the goon 's thigh , hoping to trip him . Unfortunately , it was like grabbing a piano leg . Instead , Jason was jerked upright . The unevenness of the match was already apparent to Jason , who decided he 'd prefer some kind of dialogue . " Why do n't you find someone your own size ! " he yelled in exasperation.  | " Because I do n't like perverts , " the body-builder said , practically lifting Jason off his feet . Twisting to one side , then the other , Jason wriggled out of his jacket and shot off down the alley , knocking over a garbage can as he fled . " I 'll teach you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted , kicking aside the garbage can as he started off after Jason . But Jason 's years of jogging paid off . Although the body-builder was quick despite his size , Jason could hear the man 's breathing becom- ing increasingly labored . Jason was almost at the end of the alley when he skidded on loose pebbles , momentarily losing his balance . He scrambled back to his feet just as a heavy hand grabbed his shoulder and spun him around.  | " Hold it ! Police ! " A voice shattered the stillness of the Boston night . Jason froze and so did the body-builder . The doors of an unmarked police car parked next to the mouth of the alley suddenly opened and three plainclothesmen leaped out . Once again Jason was ordered , " Up against the wall . Feet apart ! " He obeyed , but the body-builder thought about it for a moment . Finally he growled to Jason , " You 're a lucky son of a bitch . " He then complied . " Shut up ! " a policeman yelled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and told to put their hands behind their heads . One cop took out a flashlight and checked their identification . " Bruno DeMarco ? " questioned the man holding the light on the body-builder . Bruno nodded . The light switched to Jason . " Dr. Jason Howard ? " " That 's correct . " " What 's going on here ? " the policeman asked . " This little creep was trying to bother my girlfriend , " Bruno informedhim in an outraged voice . " He followed her . " The policeman looked back and forth between Jason and Bruno , then walked over to the car , opened the door , and took something from the back seat . When he returned , he handed Bruno his wallet and told him to go home and get some sleep . At first Bruno acted as though he had n't understood , but then he took his wallet . " I 'll remember you , asshole ! " he shouted at Jason as he disappearedtoward Beacon Street . " You , " the policeman said , pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stunned . He could n't believe they let the bouncer go and not him . He was about to complain when the policeman grasped his arm and forced him into the back seat.  | " You are becoming one big pain in the ass , " Detective Curran said . He was sitting stolidly , smoking . " I should have let that hunk work you over . " Jason was at a loss for words . " I hope you have some idea , " Curran continued , " of just how much you are screwing up this case . First we have Hayes 's apartmentcovered . You blew that . Then we 're watching Carol Donner and you blow that . We might as well bag the whole operation . We 're certainly not going to learn anything from her at this point . Where the hell is your car ? I presume you came in a car ? " " Just around the corner , " Jason said meekly . " I suggest you get in it and go home , " Curran said slowly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this investigation to us . You 're making our job impossible . " " I 'm sorry , " Jason began . " I did n't think ... " " Just leave ! " Curran said with a wave of dismissal . Jason climbed out of the police car , feeling pretty dumb . Of course they 'd be watching Carol . If she had been living with Hayes , she was probably involved with drugs too . In fact , with her line of work , it was almost a given . Getting into his own car , Jason thought about his jacket , said the hell with it , and drove home . It was three-thirty when he trudged up the stairs to his apartment and dutifully called his service . He had n't taken his beeper with him when he left to follow Carol Donner , and he hoped there had been no calls . He was too tired to handle an emergency . There was nothingfrom the hospital , but Shirley had left a message asking him to call the moment he got in , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgent . Perplexed , Jason dialed . Shirley answered on the first ring . " Where on earth have you been ? " " That 's a story in itself . " " I want you to do me a favor . Come over right now . " " It 's three-thirty , " Jason pleaded . " I would n't ask if it were n't important . " Jason put on another jacket , returned to his car , and drove out to Brookline , wondering what emergency could n't have waited a little longer . The only certainty was that it involved Hayes . Shirley lived on Lee Street , a road that curved around Brookline Reservoir and wound its way up into a residential area of fine oldp84homes . Her house was a fieldstone building of comfortable proportionswith a gambrel roof and twin gables . As Jason entered the cobblestone driveway , he saw that the house was ablaze with light . He pulled up across from the entrance , and by the time he was out of the car , Shirley had the door open . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a hug . She was dressed in a white cashmere sweater and faded jeans and seemed , for the first time since Jason had met her , totally distraught . She led him into a large living room and introduced him to two GHP executives who also seemed visibly upset . Jason shook hands first with Bob Walthrow , a small , balding man , and then Fred Ingelnook , a Robert Redford lookalike . " How about a cocktail ? " Shirley asked . " You look like you need it . " Just soda , " Jason said . " I 'm dead on my feet . What 's going on ? " " More trouble . I got a call from security . Hayes 's lab was broken into tonight and practically demolished . " " Vandalism ? " " We 're not sure . " " Hardly , " Bob Walthrow said . " It was searched . " " Was anything taken ? " Jason asked . " We do n't know yet , " Shirley said . " But that 's not the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Good Health ca n't take much more bad publicity . We have two large corporate clients on the fence about joining the Plan . They might be scared off if they hear that the police think Hayes 's lab was searched for drugs . " " It 's possible , " Jason said . " The medical examiner told me Hayes had cocaine in his urine . " " Shit , " Bob Walthrow said . " Let 's hope the newspapers do n't get ahold of this . " " We 've got to limit the damage ! " Shirley said . " How do you propose to do that ? " Jason asked , wondering why he 'd been called . " The governing board wants us to keep this latest incident quiet . " " That might be difficult , " Jason said , taking a sip of his soda . " The papers will probably get it from the police blotter . " " That 's exactly the point , " Shirley said . " We 've decided not to tell the police . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , surprised.  | " Well , " Shirley said , " we want the opinion of the medical staff . You 're a current chief . We thought you could quietly find out how the others felt . " " I suppose , " said Jason , wondering how he 'd go about polling the other internists and still keep the episode undercover . " But if you want my personal opinion , I do n't think it 's a good idea at all . Besides , you wo n't be able to collect insurance unless you inform the police . " " That 's a point , " Fred Ingelnook said . " True , " Shirley said , " but it 's still minor in relation to the public relations problem . For now we will not report it . But we 'll check with insurance and hear from the department chiefs . " " Sounds good to me , " Fred Ingelnook said . " Fine , " Bob Walthrow said . The conversation wound down and Shirley sent the two executives home . She held Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her at eight o'clock that morning . " I 've asked Helene to come in early . Maybe we can make some sense out of what 's going on . " Jason nodded , still wondering why Shirley could n't have told him all this on the phone . But he was too tired to care , and after giving her a brief kiss on the cheek , he staggered back out to his car , hoping for two or three hours ' sleep.  |p86It  was just after eight that Saturday morning when Jason , blearyeyed , entered Shirley 's office . It was paneled in dark mahogany , with dark green carpet and brass fixtures , and looked more like it belonged to a banker than to the chief executive of a health care plan . Shirley was on the phone talking to an insurance adjuster , so Jason sat and waited . After she hung up she said , " You were right about the insurance . They have no intention of paying a claim unless the break-in is reported . " " Then report it . " " First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's missing . " They crossed into the outpatient building and took the elevator up to the sixth floor . A security guard was waiting for them and unlocked the inner door . They dispensed with the booties and white coat . Like Hayes 's apartment , the lab was a mess . All the drawers and cabinets had been emptied onto the floor , but the high-tech equipmentappeared untouched , so it was obvious to both of them that it had been a search and not a destructive visit . Jason glanced into Hayes 's office . It was equally littered , with the contents of the desk and several file cabinets strewn about the floor . Helene Brennquivist appeared in the doorway to the animal room , her face white and drawn . Her hair was again severely pulled back from her face , but without her usual shapeless lab coat , Jason could see she had an attractive figure . " Can you tell if anything is missing ? " Shirley asked . " Well , I do n't see my data books , " Helene said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the worst is what 's happened to the animals . "  | " What about them ? " Jason asked , noting that her usually emotionlessface was trembling with fear . " Maybe you should look . They 've all been killed ! " Jason stepped around Helene and through the steel door into the animal area . He was immediately confronted with a pungent , zoolike stench . He turned on the light . It was a larger room , some fifty feet long and thirty feet wide . The animal cages were organized in rows and stacked one on top of the other , sometimes as many as six high . Jason started down the nearest row , glancing into individual cages . Behind him the door closed with a decisive click . Helene had not been exaggerating : all the animals that Jason saw were dead , hideouslycurled in contorted positions , often with bloodied tongues as if they 'd chewed them in their final agony . Suddenly Jason stopped short . Staring into a group of large cages , he saw something that made his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen . They were huge , almost the size of pigs , and their bald , whiplike tails were as thick as Jason 's wrists . Their exposed teeth were four inches long . Moving along , Jason came to rabbits the same size , and then white mice the size of small dogs . This side of genetic engineering horrified Jason . Although he was afraid of what he might see , morbid curiosity drove him on . Slowly , he looked into other cages , seeing distortions of familiar creatures that made him sick . It was science , gone mad : rabbits with several heads and mice with supernumerary extremities and extra sets of eyes . For Jason , genetic manipulation of primitive bacteria was one thing ; ' - distortion of mammals was quite another . He retreated back to the central part of the lab , where Shirley and Helene had been checking the scintillation cultures . " Have you seen the animals ? " Jason asked Shirley with disgust . " Unfortunately . When Curran was here . Do n't remind me . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , " Shirley said . " We never questioned Hayes . We neverthought we had to . " " The power of celebrity , " Jason said cynically . " The animals were part of Dr. Hayes 's growth hormone work , " Helene said defensively . " Whatever , " Jason said . He was not interested in any ethical argumentwith Helene at the moment . " At any rate , they 're all dead . "  | " All of them ? " Shirley questioned . " How bizarre . What do you think happened ? " " Poison , " Jason said grimly . " Though why anyone searching for drugs would bother to kill lab animals beats me . " " Do you have any explanation for all of this ? " Shirley said angrily , turning to Helene . The younger woman shook her head , her eyes darting nervously about the room . Shirley continued to stare at Helene , who was now shifting uncomfortablyfrom foot to foot . Jason watched , intrigued by Shirley 's suddenly aggressive behavior . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you 're going to be in a lot of trouble . Dr. Howard is convinced you 're keeping something from us . If that 's true and we find out , I hope you realize what that can do to your career . " Helene 's anxiety was finally apparent . " I just followed Dr. Hayes 's orders , " she said , her voice breaking . " What orders ? " Shirley asked , lowering her voice threateningly . " We did some free-lance work here ... " " What kind ? " " Dr. Hayes moonlighted for a company called Gene , Inc . We developed a recombinant strain of E. coli to produce a hormone for them . " " Were you aware that moonlighting was specifically forbidden underDr . Hayes 's contract ? " " That 's what he told me , " Helene admitted . Shirley glared at Helene for another minute . Finally she said , " I do n't want you to speak of this to anyone . I want you to make a detailed list of every animal and item missing or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you understand ? " Helene nodded . Jason followed Shirley out of the lab . She had obviously succeeded where he had failed , in breaking through Helene 's facade . But she had n't asked the right questions . " Why did n't you press her about Hayes 's breakthrough ? " he said as they arrived at the elevator . Shirley hit the down button repeatedly , obviously furious . " I did n't think of it . Every time I think the Hayes problem isp89under control , something new comes up . I had specifically demanded the no-moonlighting clause in his contract . " " It does n't much matter now , " Jason said , boarding the elevator after Shirley . " The man is dead . " She sighed . " You 're right . Maybe I 'm overreacting . I just wish this whole affair was over . " " I still think Helene knows more than she 's telling . " " I 'll talk to her again . " " And after seeing those animals , you do n't think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come the newspapers , " Shirley reminded him . " With the newspapers comes trouble . Aside from the animals , it does n't appear that anything terribly valuable is damaged . " Jason held his tongue . Obviously , reporting the break-in was an administrative decision . He was more concerned about discovering Hayes 's breakthrough , and he knew the police and newspapers would n't help in finding that . He wondered if the breakthrough could have involved the monstrous animals . The thought gave him a shiver . Jason started rounds with Matthew Cowen . Unfortunately , there 'd been a new development . Besides his other problems , Matthew was now acting bizarrely . Only a few minutes earlier the nurses had found him wandering in the halls , mumbling nonsense to himself . When Jason entered the room he was restrained in the bed , regarding Jason as a stranger . The man was acutely disoriented as to time , place , and person . As far as Jason was concerned , that could have meant only one thing . The man had thrown emboli , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brain . In other words he 'd had a stroke or perhaps even multiple strokes . Without delay , Jason placed a call for a neurology consult . He also called the cardiac surgeon who 'd seen the case . Although he debated immediate anticoagulation , he decided to wait for the neurologist 's opinion . In the interim , he started the patient on aspirin and Persantineto reduce platelet adhesiveness . Strokes were a disturbing developmentand a very bad sign . Jason did the rest of his rounds quickly and was about to leave for home and for some much-needed sleep when he was paged by the emergency room for one of his patients . Cursing under his breath , hep90ran downstairs , hoping whatever the problem was , it could be easily solved . Unfortunately , that was not to be the case . Arriving breathless in the main treatment room , he found a group of residents giving CPR to a comatose patient . A quick look at the monitor screen told him there was no cardiac activity at all . Jason stepped over to Judith Reinhart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her husband when he tried to waken her in the morning . " Did the EMTs see any cardiac or respiratory activity ? " " None , " Judith said . " In fact , she feels cold to me . " Jason touched the woman 's leg and agreed . Her face was turned away from him . " What 's the patient 's name ? " Jason asked , intuitively bracing himself for the blow . " Holly Jennings . " Jason felt like he 'd been hit in the stomach . " My God ! " he murmured . " Are you all right ? " Judith asked . Jason nodded , but he insisted that the ER team maintain the CPR long past any reasonable time . He 'd suspected trouble when he 'd seen Holly on Thursday , but not this . He just could n't accept the fact that , like Cedric Harring , Holly would die less than a month after her fancy GHP physical told her she was okay , and two days after he 'd seen her again . Shaken , Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So once again there 's no cardiac history ? " Margaret asked him . " That 's correct . " " What are you people doing down there ? " Margaret demanded . Jason did n't answer . He wanted Margaret to release the case so they could do the autopsy at GHP , but Margaret hesitated . " We 'll do the case today , " Jason said . " You 'll have a report early next week . " " I 'm sorry , " Margaret said , making a decision . " There are questionsin my mind , and I think I 'm obligated by law to do the au-topsy . " " I understand . But I suppose you would n't mind supplying us with specimens so we can process them here as well . " " I suppose , " Margaret said without enthusiasm . " To tell the truth ,  |p91I  do n't even know the legality . But I 'll find out . I 'd rather not wait two weeks for the microscopic . " Jason went home and fell into bed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neurologist concerning Matthew . He wanted to anticoagulate and CAT-scan the patient . Jason implored him to do whatever he thought was best . Jason tried to go back to sleep , but he could n't . He felt shellshockedand anxious . He got up . It was a gloomy , late fall day with a slight drizzle that made Boston look dreadful . Fighting a depression , he paced his apartment , searching for something to occupy his mind . Realizing he could n't stay there , he put on casual clothes and went down to his car . Knowing he was probably asking for trouble , he drove over to Beacon Street and parked in front of Carol 's apartment . Ten minutes later , as if God had finally decided to give him a break , Carol emerged . Dressed in jeans and a turtleneck , with her thick brown hair gathered in a ponytail , she seemed the young collegestudent the Club Cabaret advertised . Feeling the light drizzle , she opened a flower print umbrella and started up the street , passing within a few feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unreasonably afraid she 'd recognize him . Giving her a good lead , Jason got out of his car to follow on foot . He lost sight of her on Dartmouth Street , but picked her up at Commonwealth Avenue . As he continued to follow her , he kept a sharp eye out for the likes of Bruno or Curran . At the corner of Dartmouth and Boylston , Jason stopped at a magazine stand and thumbed through a periodical . Carol passed him , waited for the light , then hurried across Boylston . Jason studied the people and the cars , looking for anything suspicious . But there was no indication that Carol was not alone . She was now passing the Boston Public Library , and Jason guessed she was heading for the Copley Plaza Shopping Mall . After buying the magazine , which turned out to be The New Yorker , Jason continued after her . When she folded her umbrella and went into the Copley Plaza , Jason quickened his step . It was a large shopping and hotel complex , and he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an hour , Jason busied himself by pretending to study window displays , reading his New Yorker , and eyeing the crowds . Carol happily hopped from Louis Vuitton top92Ralph Lauren to Victoria 's Secret . At one point Jason thought she was being tailed , but it turned out the man in question was simply trying to pick her up . She apparently rebuffed his advance when he finally approached her , because he quickly disappeared . At a little after three-thirty , Carol took her bags and umbrella and retreated into Au Bon Pain . Jason followed , standing next to her as they waited to order and taking the opportunity to note her lovely oval face , smooth olive complexion , and dark liquid eyes . She was a handsome young woman . Jason guessed she was about twenty-four . " Good day for coffee , " he said , hoping to start a conversation . " I prefer tea . " Jason smiled sheepishly . He was n't good at pickups or small talk . " Tea 's good , too , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered soup , tea , and a plain croissant , then carried her tray to one of the large communal tables . Jason ordered a cappuccino and then , hesitating as though he could find no place to sit , approached her table . " Do you mind ? " he asked , pulling back a chair . Several of the people at the table looked up , including Carol . A man moved several of his packages . Jason sat down , giving everyone a limp smile . " What a coincidence , " Jason said to Carol . " We meet again . " Carol eyed him over her teacup . She did n't say anything , but she did n't have to . Her expression reflected her irritation . At once Jason recognized that his whole act appeared to be a come-on and that he was about to be sent packing . " Excuse me , " he said . " I do n't mean to be a bother . My name is Dr. Jason Howard . I was a colleague of Dr. Alvin Hayes . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk with you . " " You 're with GHP ? " Carol asked suspiciously . " I 'm the current chief of the medical staff . " It was the first time Jason had ever used the title . At a regular academic hospital it had great significance , but at GHP the job was a bothersome sinecure . " How can I be sure ? " Carol asked . " I can show you my license . " " Okay . " Jason reached behind for his wallet , but Carol grasped his arm . " Never mind , " she said . " I believe you . Alvin used to speak of you . Said you were the best clinician there . "  | " I 'm flattered , " Jason said . He was also surprised , considering the little contact he 'd had with Hayes . " Sorry to be so suspicious , " Carol said , " but I get hassled a lot. especially the last few days . What would you like to talk about ? " " Dr. Hayes , " Jason said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his death wasreal loss to us . You have my sympathy . " Carol shrugged . Jason was n't sure what to make of her response . " I still have trouble believing Dr. Hayes was involved with drugs . Did you know about that ? " he asked . " I did . But the newspapers had it wrong . Alvin was a minimal user , usually marijuana but occasionally cocaine . Certainly not her-oin . " " Not a dealer ? " " Absolutely not . Believe me , I would have known . " " But a lot of drugs and cash were found in his apartment . " " The only explanation I can think of is that the police put both thedrugs and the money in the apartment . Alvin was always short ofboth . If he ever had extra cash , he sent it to his family . " " You mean his ex-wife ? " " Yes . She had custody of his children . " " Why would the police do such a thing ? " Jason asked , thinking her comment echoed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really . But I ca n't think of any other way the drugs could have gotten there . I can assure you , he did n't have them when I left at nine o'clock that evening . " Jason leaned forward , lowering his voice . " The night Dr. Hayes died.he told me he 'd made a major discovery . Did he tell you anything about it ? " " He mentioned something . But that was three months ago . " For a moment Jason allowed himself to feel optimistic . Then Carolexplained that she did n't know what the discovery was . " He did n't confide in you ? " " Not lately . We 'd kinda drifted apart . " " But you were living together  --  or did the newspapers get that wrong too ? " " We were living together , " Carol admitted , " but in the end just as roommates . Our relationship had deteriorated . He really changed . I1 was n't just that he felt physically ill ; his whole personality was differp94ent . He seemed withdrawn , almost paranoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get him to do it . " " You really have no idea what the discovery was ? " Jason persisted . " Sorry , " Carol said , spreading her hands in apology . " The only thing I remember was that he said the breakthrough was ironic . I remembered because it seemed an odd way to describe success . " " He said the same to me . " " At least he was consistent . His only other comment was that if all went well , I would appreciate it because I was beautiful . Those were his exact words . " " He did n't elaborate ? " " That was all he said . " Taking a sip of his cappuccino , Jason stared at Carol 's face . How could an ironic discovery help her beauty ? His mind tried to reconcilethat statement with his guess that Hayes 's discovery had something to do with a cancer cure . It did n't fit . Finishing her tea , Carol stood up . " I 'm glad to have met you , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkwardly catching his chair to keep it from falling over . He was nonplussed by her sudden departure . " I do n't mean to be rude , " she said , " but I have an appointment . I hope you solve the mystery . Alvin worked very hard . It would be a tragedy if he 'd discovered something important and it was lost . " " My feelings exactly , " said Jason , frantic not to see her disappear . " Can we meet again ? There 's so much more I 'd like to discuss . " " I suppose . But I 'm quite busy . When did you have in mind ? " " How about tomorrow ? " Jason suggested eagerly . " Sunday brunch . " " It would have to be late . I work at night and Saturday is the busiest . " Jason could well imagine . " Please , " he said . " It could be impor-tant . " " All right . Let 's say two P.M. Where ? " " How about the Hampshire House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up her bags and umbrella . With a final smile she left the cafe.  |p95Glancing  at her watch , Carol quickened her step . The impromptu meeting with Jason had n't figured in her tight schedule , and she did n't want to be late for the meeting with her PhD adviser . She 'd spent the late evening and early afternoon polishing the third chapter of her dissertation and she was eager to hear her professor 's response . Carol took the escalator down to the street level , thinking about her conversation with Dr. Howard . It had been a surprise to meet the man after hearing about him for so long . Alvin had told her that Jason had lost his wife and had reacted to the tragedy by completely changing his environment and submerging himself in his work . Carol had found the story fascinatingbecause her thesis involved the psychology of grief . Dr. Jason Howard sounded like a perfect case study . The Weston Hotel doorman blew his whistle with a shriek that hurt Carol 's ears , making her wince . As the taxi lumbered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jason Howard went a bit further than pure professional interest . She 'd found the man unusuallyattractive , and realized that her knowledge of his vulnerabilities contributed to his appeal . Even his social awkwardness had an endearingquality . " Harvard Square , " Carol said as she got into the cab . She found herself looking forward to brunch the following morning . Still seated in front of his cooling coffee , Jason admitted to being totally bowled over by Carol 's unexpected intelligence and charm . He 'd expected an unsophisticated small-town girl who 'd somehow been lured away from high school by money or drugs . Instead she was a lovely , mature woman quite capable of holding her own in any conversation . What a tragedy that a person with her obvious assets had become mixed up in the sordid world she inhabited ... . The insistent and jarring sound of his beeper snapped Jason back to reality . He switched it off and looked at the LCD display . The word " urgent " blinked twice , followed by a telephone number Jason did not recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pain manager allowed Jason to use the phone behind the cash register . " Thank you for calling , Dr. Howard . This is Mrs. Farr . My husband , Gerald Farr , has developed terrible chest pains and he 's having trouble breathing . "  | " Call an ambulance , " Jason said . " Bring him to the GHP emergency . Is Mr. Farr a patient of mine ? " Jason thought the name sounded familiar but he could n't place it . " Yes , " Mrs. Farr said . " You did a physical on him two weeks ago . He 's the senior vice president of the Boston Banking Company . " Oh , no , Jason thought as he hung up the receiver . It 's happening again . Deciding to leave his car on Beacon Street until he 'd handled the emergency , he ran from the cafe , dashed over the pedestrian connection to the hotel side of the Copley Plaza complex , and leaped into a cab . Jason arrived at the GHP emergency room before the Farrs . He told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn Philip Barnes was on call . When he saw Gerald Farr , Jason knew immediately that his worst fears were realized . The man was in agonizing pain and was pale as skim milk , with crystalline beads of perspiration on his forehead . The initial EKG showed that a large area of the man 's heart had been damaged . It was not going to be an easy case . Morphine and oxygen helped to calm the patient , and lidocaine was given for prophylaxisagainst irregular heartbeats . But , despite everything , Farr was n't responding . Studying another EKG , Jason had the feeling that the infarcted area of the heart was expanding . In desperation , he tried everything . But it was all for naught . At five minutes to four , Gerald Farr 's eyes rolled up inside his head and his heart stopped . Unwilling as usual to give up , Jason commanded the resuscitative efforts . They got the heart to start several more times , but each time it would slip back into a deadly pattern and fail again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaredthe patient dead . " Shit ! " said Jason with disgust at himself and life in general . He was unaccustomed to swearing , and the effect of his doing so was not lost on Judith Reinhart . She leaned her forehead against Jason 's shoulder and put her arm around his neck . " Jason , you did the best you could , " she said softly . " You did the best anybody could . But our powers are limited . " " The man 's only fifty-eight , " said Jason , choking back tears of frustration . Judith cleared the room of the other nurses and residents . Comingp97back to Jason , she put her hand on his shoulder , " Look at me , Jason ! " she said . Reluctantly , Jason turned his face toward the nurse . A single tear had run down from the corner of his eye , along the crease of his nose . Softly but firmly she told Jason that he could not take these episodes so personally . " I know that two in one day is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not your fault . " Jason knew intellectually that she was right , but emotionally it was another story . Besides , Judith had no idea how badly his inpatientswere doing , especially Matthew Cowan , and Jason was embarrassed to tell her . For the first time , he seriously contemplated giving up medicine . Unfortunately , he had no idea of what else he could do . He was n't trained for anything else . After promising Judith that he was okay , Jason went out to face Mrs. Fan , steeling himself against the expected anger . But Mrs. Fan , in the depths of her grief , had decided to take the burden of guilt on herself . She said her husband had been complaining of feelingill for a week , but that she 'd ignored his complaints because , frankly , he 'd always been a bit of a hypochondriac . Jason tried to comfort the woman as Judith had tried to comfort him . He was about equally successful . Confident that the medical examiner would take the case , Jason did n't burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ME did n't need authorization to do a postmortem in cases of questionabledeath . But to be sure , he called Margaret Danforth . The responsewas as expected : she indeed wanted the case , and while she had Jason on the phone , she spoke to him about Holly Jennings . " I take back that snide comment I made this morning , " Margaret said . " You people are just having bad luck . The Jennings woman was as bad off as Cedric Harring . All her vessels looked terrible , not just the heart . " " That 's not a lot of consolation , " Jason said . " I had just given her a physical showing everything was fine . I did a follow-up EKG on Thursday , but that showed only minimal changes . " " No kidding ? Wait till you see the sections . Grossly the coronary vessels looked ninety percent occluded , and it was disseminated , not focal . Surgery would n't have done a damn thing . Oh , by the way , I checked and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I should have a formal request in writing . "  | " No problem , " Jason said . " Same with Farr ? " " Sure thing . " Jason took a cab back to his car and drove home . Despite the fog and rain , when he got home , he went for a jog . Getting mud spatteredand soaked had a mild cathartic effect , and after a shower he felt some relief from his burdensome emotions and depressive feelings . Just when he was starting to think about food , Shirley called and asked him over for dinner . Jason 's first response was to say no . But then he recognized he felt too depressed to be alone , so he accepted . After changing into more reasonable clothes , he went down to his car and headed west toward Brookline . Eastern 's flight #409 , nonstop from Miami to Boston , banked sharply before lining up for the final approach . It touched down at seven thirty-seven as Juan Diaz closed his magazine and looked out at the fog-shrouded Boston skyline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't all that pleased . He wondered why anyone would choose to live in such predictably bad weather . It had rained on his previous trip just a few days ago . Looking down on the tarmac , he saw the wind and rain in the puddles and thought nostalgically of Miami , where late fall had finally put an end to the searing summer heat . Getting his bag from under the seat in front of him , Juan wondered how long he 'd be in Boston . He remembered that on the previoustrip he 'd been there only two days , and he had n't had to do a thing . He wondered if he 'd have the same good fortune . After all , he got his five thousand no matter what . The plane taxied toward the terminal . Juan looked around the compartment with a sense of pride . He wished his family back in Cuba could see him now . Would they be surprised ! There he was , flying first class . After being sentenced to life in prison by the Castro government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first to Mariel and then , to his astonishment , to the USA . That was to be his punishment for having been convicted of multiple murder and rape  --  being sent to the USA ! It was so much easier to do his type of work in the United States . Juan felt that the one person in the world whose hand he 'd most like to shake was a peanut farmer someplace in Georgia . The plane gave a final lurch , then was still . Juan rose to his feetp99and stretched . Taking his carry-on bag , he headed for baggage . After retrieving his suitcase , he caught a cab to the Royal Sonesta Hotel , where he registered as Carlos Hernandez from Los Angeles . He even had a credit card in that name , with a legitimate number . He knew the number was good , since he 'd taken it off a receipt he 'd found at the Bal Harbour shopping plaza in Miami . Once he was comfortably relaxed in his room , with his second silk suit hanging in the closet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been given in Miami . When the phone was answered , he told the person he needed a gun , preferably a .22 caliber . With that businesstaken care of , he got out the name and address of the hit and looked up the location on the map supplied by the hotel . It was n't far away . The evening with Shirley was a great success . They dined on roast chicken , artichokes , and wild rice . Afterward they had Grand Marnier in front of the fire in the living room and talked . Jason learned that Shirley 's father had been a doctor and that back in college she 'd entertained the idea of following in his footsteps . " But my father talked me out of it , " Shirley said . " He said that medicine was changing . " " He was right about that . " " He told me that it would be taken over by big business and that someone who cared about the profession should go into management . So I switched to business courses , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure you did , too , " Jason agreed , thinking about the explosion of paperwork and the malpractice dilemma . Medicine had indeedchanged . The fact that he now worked for a salary for a corporationstood as testament to that change . When he 'd been in medical school he 'd always imagined he 'd work for himself . That had been part of the appeal . At the end of the evening , there was a bit of awkwardness . Jason said he 'd best be going , but Shirley encouraged him to stay . " You think that would be a good idea ? " Jason asked . She nodded . Jason was n't so sure , saying he 'd have to get up early for rounds and would n't want to disturb her . Shirley insisted she was up at seven-thirty as a matter of course , Sundays included.  |p100They  stared at each other for a time , the firelight making Shirley 's face glow . " There 's no obligation , " Shirley said softly . " I know we both have to be slow about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both been under stress . " " Okay , " Jason said , recognizing he did not have the strength to resist . Besides , he was flattered that Shirley was so insistent . He was becoming more open to the idea that not only could he care about another person but another person could care about him . But Jason did not get to sleep the whole night through . At threethirtyhe felt a hand on his shoulder , and he sat up , momentarily confused as to his whereabouts . In the half light , he could just make out Shirley 's face . " I 'm sorry to have to bother you , " she said gently , " but I 'm afraid the phone is for you . " She handed him the receiver from the nightstand . Jason took the phone and thanked her . He had n't even heard the phone ring . Propping himself on one elbow , he put the receiver to his ear . He was certain it would be bad news , and he was right . Matthew Cowen had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final , massive stroke . " Has the family been notified ? " Jason asked . " Yes , " said the nurse . " They live in Minneapolis . They said they 'd come in the morning . " " Thanks , " Jason said , absently giving the phone back to Shirley . " Trouble ? " Shirley asked . She set the receiver back in the cradle . Jason nodded . Trouble had become his middle name . " A youngpatient died . Thirty-five or so . He had rheumatic heart disease . Hewas in for evaluation for surgery . " " How bad was his heart disease ? " asked Shirley . " It was bad , " Jason said , seeing Matthew 's face , remembering him as he 'd been when he entered the hospital . " Three of his four valves were affected . They would have had to replace all of them . " " So there were no guarantees , " Shirley said . " No guarantees , " Jason agreed . " Three valve replacements can be tricky . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affecting his heart , lungs , kidneys and liver . There would have been problems , but he had age on his side . " " Maybe it was for the best , " Shirley suggested . " Maybe he 's beenp101spared from a lot of suffering . Sounds like he would have been in and out of the hospital for the rest of his life . " " Maybe so , " Jason said without conviction . He knew what Shirley was doing : she was trying to make him feel better . Jason appreciated her effort . He patted the thigh through the thin cover of her robe . " Thanks for your support . " The night seemed awfully cold when Jason ran out to his car . It was still raining , in fact , harder than before . Turning up the heat , he rubbed his thighs to get his circulation going . At least there was no traffic . At four A.M. , Sunday morning , the city was deserted . Shirley had tried to get him to stay , arguing that there was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family was not available . As true as this was , Jason felt an obligation to his patient that he could not dismiss . Besides , he knew he 'd not be able to get back to sleep . Not with yet another death on his conscience . The GHP parking lot was mostly empty . Jason was able to park close to the hospital entrance rather than under the outpatient building where he usually parked . As he stepped out of his car , preoccupied with thoughts of Matthew Cowen , he did n't notice a darkened figure hunched over at the side of the hospital door . Rounding the front of his car , the figure lunged at Jason . Caught completely unaware , Jason screamed . But the figure turned out to be one of the drunken street people who frequented the GHP emergency room , asking for spare change . With a shaking hand , Jason gave him a dollar , hoping he 'd at least buy himself a little food . Shirley had been right . There was nothing for Jason to do but write a final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and viewed his body . At least Matthew 's face looked calm , and as Shirley suggested , he was now spared further suffering . Silently , Jason apologizedto the dead man . Paging the resident on call , Jason instructed him to ask the family for an autopsy . Jason explained he might not be immediately available . Then , feeling as ineffectual as ever , after these deaths , he left the hospital and returned to his apartment . He lay for some time , staring at the ceiling , unable to sleep . He wondered what kind of job he could get in the pharmaceutical industry.  |p102Cedric  Harring , Brian Lennox , Holly Jennings , Gerald Farr , and now Matthew Cowen . Jason had never lost so many patients in such a short period of time . All night the parade of their faces had interruptedhis dreams , and when he awakened about eleven he was as exhausted as though he 'd never slept at all . He forced himself to do his regular Sunday six miles , then showered and dressed carefully in a pale yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a muted brown plaid jacket of linen and silk . He was glad he had the meeting with Carol to distract him . The Hampshire House was on Beacon Street , overlooking the BostonPublic Gardens . In contrast to Saturday 's rain , the sky was filled with bright sunshine and scudding clouds . The American flag flying over the Hampshire entrance snapped in the late autumn breeze . Jason arrived early and asked for a table in the front room on the first floor . A fire crackled comfortably and a piano player kept up a stream of old favorites . Jason regarded the people around him . They were all respectably dressed and were engaged in lively conversation , obviously unaware of whatever new medical horror was sweeping their city . . . . Then Jason warned himself not to let his imagination run wild . Half a dozen deaths did n't mean an epidemic . Besides , he was n't even sure it was infectious . Still , he could n't get the fatalities out of his mind . Carol arrived at five minutes after two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was appealingly dressed in a white silk blouse with black wool pants . Her fresh , young innocent appearance away from the club always amazed Jason . Noticing him , she smiled broadly and made her way over to the table . She acted mildly out of breath . " Sorry I 'm late , " she said , arranging her things , which included ap103suede jacket , a canvas bag full of papers , and a shoulder handbag . As she did so , she glanced frequently at the entrance . " Are you expecting someone ? " Jason asked . " I certainly hope not . But I have this crazy boss who insists on being overprotective . Especially since Alvin died . He 's keeping someonewith me most of the time , supposedly for my protection . At night I do n't mind , but during the day I do n't like it . Mr. Muscle showed up this morning , but I sent him on his way . He may have followed me anyway . " Jason wondered if he should mention he 'd met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after they had been served without glimpsing Bruno 's hulk that they both began to relax a bit . " I probably should be more grateful to my boss , " Carol said . " He 's been so good to me . Right now I 'm living in one of his apartmentson Beacon Street . I do n't even pay rent . " Jason did n't want to consider all the reasons for which Carol 's boss might want her to have a nice apartment . Embarrassed , he turned his attention to his omelette . " So . . . " Carol said , brandishing her fork . " What else did you want to ask me ? " She took a sizable bite of her French toast . " Have you remembered anything else about Alvin Hayes 's discov-ery ? " " Nope , " Carol said , swallowing . " Besides , even when he used to discuss his work with me , I found it incomprehensible . He always forgot that not everyone is a nuclear physicist . " Carol laughed , her eyes sparkling attractively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another bioengineering company , " Jason said . " Did you know anything about that ? " " I guess you 're referring to G , , , . " Carol paused , her smile fading . " That was supposed to be a big secret . " She cocked her head to the side . " But now that he 's gone , I guess it does n't matter . He 'd worked for them for about a year . " " Do you ) uaw.w.hathe did for them ? " " Not really . Something with urowth hormone . But lately they 'd gotten into a row ' . S ' ' omething to do with finances . I do n't know the details .. " Jason realized that he 'd been right after all . Helene had been holding back . If Hayes had been feuding with Gene , Inc. , she must have known.  | " What do you know about Helene Brennquivist ? " " She 's a nice lady . " Carol put down her fork . " Well . . that 's not quite sincere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth , Helene is the reason Alvin and I stopped being lovers . Because they worked together so much , she started coming over to the apartment . Then I found out they were having an affair . That I could n't handle . It irked me she 'd been so secret about it , especially right under my nose in my own house . " Jason was amazed . He 'd guessed that Helene was withholding information , but it had never dawned on him that she was sleeping with Hayes . Jason studied Carol 's face . He could see that mentioning the affair had brought back unpleasant feelings . Jason wondered if Carol had been as angry with Hayes as she was with Helene . " What about Hayes 's family ? " he asked , deliberately changing the subject . " I do n't know much about them . I spoke to his ex-wife on the phone once or twice , but never in person . They 'd been divorced for five years or so . " " Did Hayes have a son ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know where they lived ? " " A small town in New Jersey . Leonia or something like that . I remember the street though  --  Park Avenue . I remembered that because  it sounded so pretentious . " " Did he ever say anything about one of his sons being sick ? " Carol shook her head . Motioning to a waitress , Carol indicated she wanted more coffee . They ate in silence for a while , enjoying the food and the atmosphere . When Jason 's beeper went off , it startled them both . Luckily , it was just his service saying Cowen 's family had finally arrived from Minneapolis and hoped to meet him at the hospital around four . Returning from the phone , Jason suggested they take advantage of the nice weather and walk in the garden . After they 'd crossed BeaconStreet , she surprised him by taking his arm . He surprised himself by enjoying it . Despite her somewhat dubious profession , Jason had to admit he enjoyed her company immensely . Aside from her wholesomegood looks , her vitality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed under the mounted bronze statue of Washington , then crossed the bridge spanning thep105central neck of the waterway . The swan boats had been retired for the season . Finding an empty bench under a now naked willow tree , Jason turned the conversation back to Hayes . " Did he do anything out of the ordinary over the last three months ? Anything unexpected . . . out of character ? " Carol picked up a pebble and tossed it into the water . " That 's a hard question , " she said . " One of the things I liked about Alvin was his impulsiveness . We would do a lot of things on the spur of the moment , like taking trips . " " Had he done much traveling recently ? " " Oh , yes , " Carol said , searching for another stone . " Last May he went to Australia . " " Did you go ? " " No . He did n't take me . He said it was strictly business  --  and that he needed Helene to help him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chump that I was . " " Did you ever find out what his business was ? " . Something involving Australian mice . I remember him saying they hadpeculiar habits . But that 's all I knew . He had lots of mice and rats in his lab . " " I know , " Jason said , vividly picturing the revolting dead animals . Jason had asked if Hayes had been behaving oddly . A sudden trip to Australia might be considered bizarre , but without knowing his currentstudies it was hard to be sure . He 'd have to take the issue up with Helene . " Any other trips ? " " I got to go to Seattle . " " When was that ? " " In the middle of July . Apparently old Helene was n't feeling up to par , and Alvin needed a driver . " " A driver ? " " That was another weird thing about Alvin , " Carol said . " He could n't drive . He said he 'd never learned and never would . " Jason recalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no driver 's license . " What happened in Seattle ? " " Not a lot . We were only in the city a couple of days . We did visit the University of Washington . Then we headed up into the Cascades.  |p106Now  , that 's beautiful country , but if you think it rains a lot in Boston , wait until you visit the Pacific Northwest . Have you ? " " No , " Jason said absently . He tried to imagine a discovery that would involve trips to Seattle and Australia . " How long were you away ? " " Which time ? " " You went more than once ? " " Twice , " Carol said . " The first trip was for five days . We visited the University of Washington and saw the sights . On the second trip , which was several weeks later , we only stayed two nights . " " Did you do the same things both times ? " Carol shook her head . " The second trip we bypassed Seattle and went directly into the Cascades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I just hung out , relaxed . We went to a lodge . It was gorgeous . " " What about Alvin ? What did he do ? " " About the same . But he was interested in the ecology and all that stuff . You know , always the scientist . " " So it was like a vacation ? " Jason asked , thoroughly perplexed . " I suppose . " She tossed another stone . " What did Alvin do at the University of Washington ? " Jason asked . " He saw an old friend . Ca n't think of his name . Someone he trained with at Columbia . " " A molecular geneticist like Alvin ? " " I believe so . But we weren t tie very long . I visited the PsychologyDepartment while they were talking . " " That must have been interesting . " Jason smiled , thinking the psychologydepartment would have enjoyed getting their academic hands on the likes of Carol Donner . " Damn , " she said , suddenly checking her watch . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jason stood up , taking her hand . He was impressed by the delicacy with which Carol described her work . " An appointment " sounded so professional . They walked to the edge of the park . Refusing a ride , Carol said good-bye and started up Beacon Street . Jason watched as her figure receded in the distance . She seemed so carefree and happy . What a tragedy , he thought . Time , which seems boundless to her youthful mind , will soon catch up with her . Whatp107kind of life was topless dancing and dates with men ? He did n't like to think about it . Turning in the opposite direction , Jason walked to De Luca 's Market and bought the makings for a simple supper : barbecuedchicken and salad greens . All the while he went over his conversation with Carol . He had a lot more information , but it provided more questions than conclusions . Still , he was now sure of two things . One , Hayes had definitely made a discovery , and two , the key was Helene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole scenario planned out . Since this was not supposed to look like a traditional hit , it required more thought . The usual ploy was to nail the victim in a crowd , putting a low-caliber pistol to the head , and pow , it was all over . That kind of operation needed little planning , only the right circumstances . The whole performance relied on the peculiar mentali y.of crowds . After any shocking event , everyone was so intent on the victim that the perpetrator could melt away unnoticed , even pretending to be one of the curious onlookers . All he had to do was drop the gun . But the instructions on this job were different . The hit was to be staged as a rape , Juan 's specialty . He smiled to himself , amazed that he could get paid for something he used to do as a sport . The United States was a strange and wonderful place , where the law often gave the felon more consideration than the victim . This time Juan realized he 'd have to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge . It was also what made it fun , because without witnesses he could do what he liked with the woman , as long as when he left she was dead . Juan decided to follow the victim and accost her in the foyer of her building . The threat of immediate bodily injury made in a soft , reasonablevoice should be enough to persuade her to take him up to her apartment . Once inside , it would be all fun and games . He followed the mark on a short shopping excursion in Harvard Square . She bought a magazine at a corner kiosk , then headed for a grocery store called Sages . Juan lingered across the street , examining the window of a bookstore , surprised the place was open on Sunday . The mark came out of the grocery store with a plastic shopping bag , cut diagonally across the street , and disappeared into a bakery cafe.  |p108Juan  followed  --  coffee sounded good , even if it was the American kind . He preferred Cuban coffee : thick , sweet , and rich . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his victim . He was astounded at his good luck . The woman was beautiful . He guessed mid-twenties . What a deal , he thought . He could already feel himself getting hard . He would n't have to fake this one . Half an hour later , the mark finished , paid , and walked out of the cafe . Juan tossed a ten-dollar bill on the table . He felt generous . After all , he 'd be five thousand richer when he got back to Miami . To his delight , the woman continued up Brattle Street . Juan slowed his pace , content to just keep her in view . When she turned onto Concord , he speeded up , knowing she was almost home . When she reached Craigie Arms Apartment Complex , Juan was right behind her . A quick glance up and down Concord Avenue suggested the timing was perfect . Now it depended on what was happening inside the building . Juan paused long enough to be sure the inner door had beenopened . With split-second timing he was in the foyer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was then that he spoke . " Miss Brennquivist ? " Momentarily startled , Helene looked into Juan 's darkly handsome Hispanic face . " Ja , " she said with her Scandinavian accent , thinking he must be a fellow tenant . " I 've been dying to meet you . My name is Carlos . " Helene paused fatally , her keys still in her hand . " Do you live here ? " she asked . " Sure do , " Juan said with practiced ease . " Second floor . How about you ? " " Third , " Helene said . She stepped through the door , Juan directly behind her . " Nice to meet you , " she added . She debated using the stairs or the elevator . Juan 's presence made her feel uncomfortable . " I was hoping we could talk , " Juan said , coming alongside her . " How about inviting me up for a drink ? " " I do n't think that . . . " Helene saw the gun and gasped . " Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in a soothing voice . " I do things I regret when I 'm angry . " He hit the elevator button.  |p109The  doors opened . He motioned for Helene to enter and stepped in behind her . Everything was working perfectly . As the elevator clanked and thumped upward , Juan smiled warmly . It was best to keep everything calm . Helene was paralyzed by panic . Not knowing what to do , she did nothing . The man terrified her , yet he seemed reasonable , and he was very well dressed . He looked like a successful businessman . Maybe he was associated with Gene , Inc. , and they wanted to search her apartment . She thought briefly about screaming or trying to run , but then she remembered the gun . The elevator grated open on the third floor . Juan graciously motioned for her to proceed . With her keys in her shaking hand , she walked toward her door and opened it . Juan immediately put his foot over the threshold , just as he 'd done downstairs . After they 'd both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using all three latches . Helene stood dumbly in the small entrance hall , unable to move . " Please , " Juan said , politely motioning for her to enter the living room . To his surprise , a plump blonde was sitting on the sofa . Juan had been told Helene lived alone . Never mind , he thought . " What is that saying you people have ? " he murmured . " When it rains , it pours . This party is going to be twice as good as I expected . " He brandished his weapon , motioning for Helene to sit opposite her roommate . The women exchanged anxious looks . Then Juan yanked the telephone line from the wall , leaving the three colorcodedwires to dangle nakedly in the air . He went over to Helene 's stereo and turned on the tuner . A classical station came on . Figuring out the digital controls , he switched to a hard-rock station and turned up the volume . " What kind of party is it without some music ? " he shouted as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hospital early Monday morning and suffered through rounds . No one was doing well . After he got to his office , he began calling Helene at every spare moment . She never answered . At midmorning he even ran up to the sixth floor lab only to find it dark and deserted . Returning to his office , Jason was irritated . He felt that Helene had been obstructive from the start , and now by not making herself available , she was compounding the problem . Jason picked up the telephone , called personnel , and got Helene 's home address and phone number . He called immediately . After the phone rang about ten times , he slammed the receiver down in frustration . He then called personnel and asked to speak to the director , Jean Clarkson . When she came on the line , Jason inquired about Helene Brennquivist : " Has she called in sick ? I 've been trying to reach her all morning . " " I 'm surprised , " Ms. Clarkson said . " We have n't heard from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think she 's missed a day in a year and a half . " " But if she were ill , " Jason asked , " you would expect her to call ? " " Absolutely . " Jason hung up the phone . His irritation changed to concern . He had a bad feeling about Helene 's absence . His office door opened and Claudia stuck her head in . " Dr. Danforth 's on line two . Do you want to talk with her ? " Jason nodded . " Do you need someone 's chart ? " " No , thanks , " Jason said as he lifted the phone . Dr. Danforth 's resonant voice came over the line : " I 'd say Good Health had better start screening their patients . I 've never seenp111corpses in such bad shape . Gerald Farr is as bad as the rest . He did n't have an organ that appeared less than one hundred years old ! " Jason did n't answer . " Hello ? " Margaret said . " I 'm here , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margaret that a month ago he 'd done a complete physical on Fan and found nothing wrong despite the man 's unhealthy lifestyle . " I 'm surprised he did n't have a stroke several years ago , " Margaretsaid . " All his vessels were atheromatous . The carotids were barely open . " " What about Roger Wanamaker 's patient ? " Jason asked . " What was the name ? " " I do n't know , " he admitted . " The man died on Friday of a stroke . Roger said you were getting the case . " " Oh , yes . He also presented almost total degeneration . I thought health plans were supposed to provide largely preventive medicine . You people are n't going to make much money if you sign up such sick patients . " Margaret laughed . " Kidding aside , it was another case of multisystem disease . " " Do you people do routine toxicology ? " Jason asked suddenly . " Sure . Especially nowadays . We test for cocaine , that sort of stuff . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would that be possible ? " " I think we still have blood and urine , " Margaret said . " What do you want us to look for ? " " Just about everything . I 'm fishing , but I have no idea what 's going on here . " " I 'll be happy to run a battery of tests , " Margaret said , " but GeraldFarr was n't poisoned , I can tell you that . He just ran out of time . It was as if he were thirty years older than his actual age . I know that does n't sound very scientific , but it 's the truth . " " I 'd appreciate the toxicology tests just the same . " " Will do , " Margaret said . " And we 'll be sending some specimens for your people to process . I 'm sorry it takes us so long to do our microscopics . " Jason hung up and went back to work , vacillating between selfdoubtand the discomfiting sense that something was going on that was beyond his comprehension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lab . There was still no answer . He called Jean Clarksonagain , who said that she 'd call if she heard from Miss Brennquivistand to please stop bothering her . Then she slammed down the phone . Nostalgically Jason remembered those days when he got more respect from the hospital staff . After seeing the last morning patient , Jason sat at his desk nervouslydrumming his fingers . All at once a wave of certainty spread through him , telling him that Helene 's absence was not only significant , it was serious . In fact , he was convinced that it was so serious that he should inform the police immediately . Jason traded his white coat for his suit jacket , and went to his car . He decided he 'd better see Detective Curran in person . After their last encounter , he did n't think Curran would take him seriously over the phone . Jason remembered the way to Curran 's office without difficulty . Glancing into the sparsely furnished room , he saw the detective working over a form at his metal desk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prisoner trying to escape . " Curran , " Jason said , hoping the man would be in a better mood than he 'd been the other night . Curran glared up . " Oh , no ! " he exclaimed , tossing his pencil onto the uncompleted form . " My favorite doctor ! " He made an exaggeratedexpression of exasperation , then waved Jason into his office . Jason pulled a metal-backed chair over to Curran 's desk . The detective eyed him with obvious misgiving . " There 's been a new development , " Jason said . " I thought you should know . " " I thought you were going back to doctoring . " Ignoring the cut , Jason went on . " Helene Brennquivist has n't been at work all day . " " Maybe she 's sick . Maybe she 's tired . Maybe she 's been sick and tired of you and all your questions . " Jason tried to hold on to his temper . " Personnel says she 's extremelyreliable . She 'd never take a day off without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no answer . " Detective Curran gave Jason a disdainful look . " Have you considered the possibility that the attractive young lady might have taken a long weekend with a boyfriend ? "  | " I do n't think so . Since I saw you I 've learned she was having an affair with Hayes . " Curran sat up and for the first time gave Jason his full attention . " I always felt she was covering for Hayes , " Jason continued . " Now I know why . And I also believe she knows a lot more about his work than she 's saying , and why his places were searched . I think Hayes made a major breakthrough and someone is after his notes  --  " " If there was a breakthrough . " " I 'm sure there was , " Jason said . " And it adds to my suspicions about Hayes 's death . It was too convenient . " " You 're jumping to conclusions . " " Hayes said someone was trying to kill him , " Jason said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murdered because of it . " Hold on ! " Curran shouted , banging his fist on his desk . " The medical examiner determined that Dr. Alvin Hayes died of natural causes . " " An aneurysm , to be exact . But he was still being followed . " " He thought he was , " Curran corrected , his voice rising in anger . " I think he was too , " Jason said with equal vehemence . " Thatwould explain why someone ransacked his apartment and his  --  " " We know why his apartment was tossed , " Curran interrupted . " Only we found the drugs and the money first ! " " Hayes may have used cocaine . " Jason was shouting now . " But he was n't a dealer ! And I think those drugs were planted , and  --  " He started to mention his conversation with Carol , then stopped . He was n't ready to tell Curran that he had persisted in seeing the dancer . " In any case , " he said more quietly , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone was searching for his lab books . " " What was that about a lab ? " Curran 's heavylidded eyes opened wide and his face turned a mottled red . Jason swallowed . " Dammit ! " Curran yelled . " You mean to tell me Hayes 's lab was tossed and it was n't reported ? What do you people think you 're doing ? " " The clinic was concerned about negative press , " Jason said , forced to defend the decision he did not condone . " When did this happen ? "  | " Friday night . " " What was taken ? " " Several data books and some bacterial cultures . But none of the valuable equipment . And it was n't a robbery . " Jason watched Curran'shound-dog face for some sign his concern for Helene was vindicated . " Any damage , vandalism ? " was all he said . " Well , they turned the place upside down and dumped everything on the floor . So the lab was a mess . But the only deliberate destructioninvolved those , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Those monsters should have been destroyed . They made me sick . How were they killed ? " " Probably poisoned . Our pathology department is checking that out . " Detective Curran ran his thick fingers through his once-red hair . " You know something ? " he asked rhetorically . " With the amount of cooperation I 've gotten from you eggheads , I 'm goddamned glad I turned this case over to Vice . They can have it . Maybe you 'd like to go down the hall and rant and rage at them . Maybe they 'll get a charge out of the fact that your mad scientist was humping his lab assistant as well as the exotic dancer  --  " " Hayes and the dancer were no longer lovers . " " Oh , really ? " Curran asked with a short , hollow laugh that ended in a belch . " Why do n't you go over to the Vice department and leave me alone , doctor . I have a lot of genuine homicides to ponder . " Curran picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jason returned to the ground floor and surrendered his visitor 's pass . Then he went out to his car . Driving along Storrow Drive , with the Charles River lazily spread out on the right , Jason finally began to calm down . He was still convinced something had happened to Helene , but he decided that if the police were n't concerned , there was little he could do . He pulled into the GHP parking lot and went back to his office . Claudia and Sally had n't returned from their lunch break yet . A few patients were already waiting . Jason changed back to his white coat and called to check on Madaline Krammer 's cardiac consult . Harry Sarnoff had agreed with Jason 's appraisal , and Madaline was having an angiogram . As soon as Sally returned , Jason went to work seeing his sched/uled patients . He was on his third afternoon patient when Claudia ducked into the exam room . " You have a visitor , " she announced . " Who ? " Jason asked , tearing off a prescription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the mouth . I thought I should warn you . " Jason handed the prescription to the patient , tossed his stetho- scope around his neck , and walked down the corridor to his office . Shirley was standing by the window . The moment she heard Jason she turned to face him . She was without question furious . " I certainly hope you have a good explanation , Dr. Howard , " she said . " I just got a call from the police . They 're on their way here to get a formal statement on why I did n't report the break-in of Hayes 's lab . They said they heard about it from you  --  and they 're threatening obstruction of justice . " " I 'm sorry , " said Jason . " It was an accident . I was at the police station . I did n't mean to mention it . . . " " And just what the hell were you doing down at the station ? " " I wanted to see Curran , " Jason said guiltily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should have . " " About the break-in ? " " No , " Jason said , letting his hands fall to his sides . " Helene Brennquivist has n't shown up today . I found out that she and Hayes were having an affair , and I guess I jumped to conclusions . The break-in just slipped out . " " I think it would be best if you stayed with doctoring , " Shirley said , her voice softening a degree . " That 's what Curran said , " sighed Jason . " Well , " Shirley said , reaching out and touching Jason 's arm , " at least you did n't do it on purpose . For a while there I was wondering whose side you were on . I tell you , this Hayes affair has a life of its own . Every time I think the problem is contained , something else breaks . " " I 'm sorry , " Jason said sincerely . " I did n't mean to make things worse . " " It 's okay . But remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's not compound our difficulties . " She gave Jason 's hand a squeeze , then walked to the door.  |p116Jason  went back to his patients , determined to leave the investigationto the police . It was nearly four when Claudia interrupted again . " You have a call , " she whispered . " Who is it ? " Jason asked nervously . The usual modus operandi was for Claudia to take messages and for Jason to return the calls at the end of the day . Unless , of course , it was an emergency . But Claudia did n't whisper when it was an emergency . " Carol Donner , " she said . Jason hesitated , then said he 'd take it in his office . Claudia followed , still whispering . " Is that the Carol Donner ? " " Who is the Carol Donner ? " " The dancer in the Combat Zone , " Claudia said . " I would n't know , " Jason said , entering his office . He closed the door on Claudia and picked up the phone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is Carol Donner . I 'm sorry to bother you . " " No bother . " Her voice brought back the pleasant image of her sitting across from him at the Hampshire House . He heard a click . " Just a moment , Carol . " He put the phone down , opened the door , and looked across the room at Claudia . With an irritated expression , he motioned for her to hang up . " Sorry , " Jason said , returning to the phone . " I would n't call you unless I thought it might be important , " Carol said . " But I came across a package in my locker at work . I 'm a dancer at the Club Cabaret , by the way .... " " Oh , " Jason said vaguely . " Anyway , " Carol said , " I had to go in to the club today and I found it . Alvin had asked me to put it in my locker several weeks ago and I 'd forgotten all about it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers and correspondence . That type of stuff . There were no drugs , if that 's what you were wondering . " " No , " Jason said , " that 's not what I was wondering . But I 'm glad you called . The books might be important . I 'd like to see them . " " Okay , " Carol said . " I 'll be at the club tonight . I 'll have to think of some way to get them to you . My boss is giving me a lot of trouble about protection . Something weird is going on , which they wo n't tell me about , but I 'm stuck with this goon following me around . I 'd just as soon not involve you in that . "  | " Maybe I could come and pick it up ? " " No , I do n't think that would be a good idea . I 'll tell you what . If you give me your number , I 'll call when I get home tonight . " Jason gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Last night I realized there was something else I did n't tell you . About a month ago , Alvin said he was going to break up with Helene . He said he wanted her to concen- trate on their work . " " Do you think he told her ? " " Have n't the slightest idea . " " Helene has n't shown up for work today . " " No kidding ! " Carol said . " That 's strange . From what I 'd heard she was compulsive about work . Maybe she 's the reason my boss is acting so crazy . " " How would your boss know about Helene Brennquivist ? " " He has a great informational network . He knows what 's going on in the whole city . " Hanging up , Jason pondered the confusing inconsistencies betweenCarol 's job and her intellectual sophistication . " Informational network " was a computer-age term  --  unexpected from an exotic dancer . Going back to his patients , Jason studiously avoided Claudia 's questioning gaze . He knew she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her any satisfaction . Toward the very end of the afternoon , Dr. Jerome Washington , a burly black physician who specialized in gastrointestinal disorders , interrupted Jason , asking for a quick consult . " Sure , " Jason said , taking him back to his office . " Roger Wanamaker suggested I speak to you about this case . " He took a bulky chart from under his arm and put it on the desk . " A few more like this and I 'm going into the aluminum siding business . " Jason opened the chart . The patient was male , sixty years old . " I did a physical on Mr. Lamborn twenty-three days ago , " Jerome said . " The guy was a little overweight , but are n't we all ? Otherwise l thought he was okay and told him so . Then , a week ago , he comes in looking like death warmed over . He 'd dropped twenty pounds . I put him in the hospital , thinking he had a malignancy I 'd missed . I gave him every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago he died . lp118put a lot of pressure on the family for an autopsy . And what did it show ? " " No malignancy . " " Right , " Jerome said . " No malignancy but every organ he had was totally degenerated . I told Roger and he said to see you , that you 'd commiserate . " " Well , I 've had some similar problems , " Jason said . " So has Roger . To be truthful , I 'm worried we 're on the brink of some unknownmedical disaster . " " What are we going to do ? " Jerome asked . " I ca n't take too much of this kind of emotional abuse . " " I agree . With all the deaths I 've had lately , I 've been thinking of changing professions too . And I do n't understand why we 're not picking up symptoms on our physicals . I told Roger I 'd call a meetingnext week , but now I think we ca n't afford to wait . " An image of Hayes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mind . " Let 's get together tomorrow afternoon . I 'll have Claudia set it up , and I 'll tell the secretaries to put together a list of all the physicals we 've done over the last year and see what 's happened to the patients . " " Sounds good to me , " Jerome said . " Cases like this do n't do much for a man 's confidence . " After Jerome left , Jason went out to the central desk to make plans for the staff conference . He knew that a few people would have to put in some overtime , and he thanked providence for providing computers . There were a few groans when he explained what was needed , including rebooking all the afternoon patients , but Claudia took it on herself to be the ringleader . Jason was confident things would get done as well as the short time would permit . At five-thirty , after seeing his last patient , Jason tried Helene 's home number . Still no answer . Impulsively , he decided to stop by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address he 'd gotten from personnel and noted she lived in Cambridge on Concord Avenue . Then he recognized the address . It was the Craigie Arms apartmentbuilding . What a coincidence , he thought . Before meeting Danielle he 'd dated a girl at the Craigie Arms . Descending to his car , Jason headed over to Cambridge . The trafficwas terrible , but thanks to his familiarity with the area he had nop119trouble locating the address . He parked his car and went into the familiar lobby . Scanning the names , he found Brennquivist and pressed the buzzer . There was always the outside chance Helene was n't picking up her phone , but would respond to the door . There was no answer . Jason looked at the tenant list , but Lucy Hagen 's name was gone . After all , it had been fifteen years . Instead , he reached for the super 's buzzer and pressed it . A small speaker above the door buzzers crackled to life , and the gruff voice of Mr. Gratz grated out into the tiled foyer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , admitting that Mr. Gratz might not remember him since it had been a few years . He said he was concerned about a colleague who was a tenant . Mr. Gratz did n't say anything , but the door buzzed open . Jason had to run a few steps to get it . Inside , Jason confronted the unmistakable odor , which he 'd remembered for fifteen years . It was the smell of grilled onions . A metal door opened down the tiled hall and Mr. Gratz appeared dressed , as always , in a tank-top undershirt and soiled jeans . He sported a two-day growth of beard . He studied Jason 's face , demandedhis name again , then asked , " Did n't you used to date the Hagen girl in 2-J ? " Jason was impressed . The man certainly would n't win any beauty contests , but he apparently had a memory like a steel trap . Jason had gotten to know him because Lucy had chronic problems with her drains and Larry Gratz was in and out of her apartment . " What can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained that Helene Brennquivist had n't shown up for work and was n't answering her phone . Jason said he was worried . " I ca n't let you in her apartment . " " Oh , I understand , " Jason said . " I just want to make sure everything is okay . " Gratz regarded him for a moment , grunted , then started toward the elevator . He pulled a ring of keys out of his pocket that looked adequate enough to open half the doors in Cambridge . They rode the elevator without speaking . Helene 's apartment was at the end of a long hall . Even before they got to the door , they could hear loud rock and roll . " Sounds like she 's having a party , " Gratz said . He rang the bell for a full minute , but there was no response . Gratz put his ear to thep120door and rang again . " Ca n't even hear the door chimes , " he said . " Wonder no one 's complained about the music . " Lifting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he selected a key and turned the lock . As the door opened , the volume of the music increased dramatically . " Shit , " Gratz said . Then he yelled , ' Hello ! " There was no answer . The apartment had a small foyer with an arched opening to the left , but even from where he stood Jason recognized the unmistakablesmell of death . He started to speak , but Gratz stopped him . " You better wait here , " Gratz said over the pounding music as he advanced toward the living room . " Oh , Christi " he shouted a second later . His eyes opened wide as his face contorted with horror . Jason looked between the arch and Larry 's body . The room was a nightmare . The super ran for the kitchen , his hand clasped over his mouth . Even with his medical training , Jason felt his own stomach turn over . Helene and another woman were side by side on the couch , naked , with their hands tied behind their back . Their bodies had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jammed into the coffee table . Jason turned and looked into the kitchen . Larry was bent over the kitchen sink , heaving . Jason 's first response was to help him , but he thought better of it . Instead , he went to the door to the hall and opened it , thankful for the fresh air . In a few minutes Larry stumbled past him . " Why do n't you go call the police , " Jason said , allowing the door to close behind him . The relative quiet was refreshing . His nausea abated . Thankful for something to do , Larry ran down the stairs . Jason leaned against the wall and tried not to think . He was trembling . Two policemen arrived in short order . They were young and turned several shades of green when they looked into the living room . But they set about sealing off the scene and carefully questioningJason and Gratz . With care not to disturb anything else , they finally pulled the plug on the stereo . More police arrived , including plainclothes detectives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and someone called him . A police photographerarrived and began snapping shot after shot of the devastated apartment . Then the Cambridge medical examiner arrived.  |p121Jason  was waiting in the hall when Curran came lumbering towardHelene 's apartment . Seeing Jason , he paused only to shout , " What the hell are you doing here ? " Jason held his tongue , and Curran turned to the policeman standing by the door . " Where 's the detective in charge ? " he snapped , flashing his badge . The policeman jerked his thumb in the direction of the living room . Curran went in , leaving Jason in the hall . The press appeared with their usual tangle of cameras and spiral notebooks . They tried to enter Helene 's apartment , but the uniformedpoliceman at the door restrained them . That reduced them to interviewing anybody in the area , including Jason . Jason told them he knew nothing , and they eventually left him alone . After a while Curran reappeared . Even he looked a little green . He came over to Jason . He took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of finding a match . Finally , he looked at Jason . " Do n't tell me I told you so , ' " he said . " It was n't just a rape murder , was it ? " Jason asked quietly . " That 's not for me to say . Sure , it was a rape . What makes you think it was more ? " " The mutilation was done after death . " " Oh ? Why do you say that , doctor ? " " Lack of blood . If the women had been alive , there would have been a lot of bleeding . " " I 'm impressed , " Curran said . " And while I hate to admit it , we do n't think it was your ordinary loony . There 's evidence I ca n't discuss but it looks like a professional job . A small-caliber weapon was involved . " " Then you agree Helene 's death is tied to Hayes . " " Possibly , " Curran said . " They told me you discovered the bod-ies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What brought you over here , doctor ? " Jason did n't answer immediately . " I 'm not sure , " he said finally . " As I told you , I had an uncomfortable feeling when Helene did n't show up for work . " Curran scratched his head , letting his attention wander around the hallway . He took a long drag on his cigarette , letting the smoke outp122through his nose . There was a crowd of police , reporters , and curious tenants . Two gurneys were lined up against the wall , waiting to take the bodies away . " Maybe I wo n't turn the case over to Vice , " Curran said at last . Then he wandered off . Jason approached the policeman standing guard at the door to Helene 's apartment . " I was wondering if I could go now . " " Hey , Rosati ! " yelled the cop . The detective in charge , a thin , hollow-faced man with a shock of dark , unruly hair , appeared almost immediately . " He wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jason . " We got your name and address ? " Rosati asked . " Name , address , phone , social security , driver 's license  --  every-thing . " " I suppose it 's okay , " Rosati said . " We 'll be in touch . " Jason nodded , then walked down the hallway on shaky legs . When he emerged outside on Concord Avenue , he was surprised it had already gotten dark . The cold evening air was heavy with exhaust fumes . As one final slap in the face , Jason found a parking ticket under his windshield wiper . Irritated , he pulled it out , realizing he 'd parked in a zone that required a Cambridge resident sticker . It took much longer for him to return to GHP than it had taken to drive to Helene 's apartment . The traffic on Storrow Drive was backed up exiting at Fenway , so it was about seven-thirty P.M. when he finally parked and entered the building . Going up to his office , he found a large computer printout on his desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last year , along with a notation of the patient 's current physical status . The secretariesdid a great job , Jason thought , putting the printout in his briefcase . He went up to the floor for inpatient rounds . One of the nurses gave him the results of Madaline Krammer 's arteriogram . All the coronary vessels showed significant , diffuse , nonfocal encroachment . When the results were compared with a similar study done six months previously , it showed significant deterioration . Harry Sarnoff , the consulting cardiologist , did not feel she was a candidate for surgery , and with her current low levels of both cholesterol and fatty acids , had little to suggest with regard to her management . To be onep123hundred percent certain , Jason ordered a cardiac surgery consul then went in to see her . As usual , Madaline was in the best of moods , minimizing he symptoms . Jason told her that he 'd asked a surgeon to take a look a her , and promised to stop by the next day . He had the awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much longer . When h checked her ankles for edema , Jason noted some excoriations . " Have you been scratching yourself ? " he asked . " A little , " Madaline admitted , grasping the sheet and pulling it u as if she were embarrassed . " Are your ankles itchy ? " " I think it 's the heat in here . It 's very dry , you know . " Jason did n't know . In fact , the air-conditioning system of the hom pital kept the humidity at a constant , normal level . With a horrible sense of deja vu , Jason went back to the nurse ; station and ordered a dermatology consult as well as a chemistr screen that included some forty automated tests . There had to b something he was missing . The rest of rounds was equally depressing . It seemed all his pa tients were in decline . When he left the hospital he decided to take run out to Shirley 's . He felt like talking and she 'd certainly made i clear she enjoyed seeing him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's murder before she heard it from the press . He knew i was going to devastate her . It took about twenty minutes before he pulled into her cobbleston driveway . He was pleased to see lights on . " Jason ! What a pleasant surprise , " Shirley said , answering the bel She was dressed in red leotards with black tights and a white head band . " I was just on my way to aerobics . " " I should have called . " " Nonsense , " Shirley said , grabbing his hand and pulling him in side . " I 'm always looking for an excuse not to exercise . " She led hir into the kitchen , where a mountain of reports and memoranda co ered the table . Jason was reminded of what an enormous amount c work went into running an organization like GHP . As always , h was impressed by Shirley 's skills . After she brought him a drink , Jason asked if she 'd heard th news.  | " I do n't know , " Shirley said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " News about what ? " " Helene Brennquivist , " Jason said . He let his voice trail off . " Is this news I 'm going to like ? " Shirley asked , picking up her drink . " I hardly think so , " Jason said . " She and her roommate were murdered . " Shirley dropped her drink on the couch and then mechanically occupied herself cleaning up the mess . " What happened ? " she asked after a long silence . " It was a rape murder . At least ostensibly . " He felt ill as he recalledthe scene . " How awful , " Shirley said , clutching her hand to her chest . " It was gruesome , " agreed Jason . " It 's every woman 's worst nightmare . When did it happen ? " " They seem to think it happened last night . " Shirley stared off into the middle distance . " I 'd better phone Bob Walthrow . This is only going to add to our PR woes . " Shirley heaved herself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hear the emotion in her voice as she explained what had happened . " I do n't envy you your job , " he said when she hung up . He could see her eyes were bright with unshed tears . " I feel the same about yours , " she said . " Every time I see you after a patient dies , I 'm glad I did n't go into medicine myself . " Although neither Shirley nor Jason was particularly hungry , they made a quick spaghetti dinner . Shirley tried to talk Jason into stayingthe night , but though he had found comfort being with her , helping him to endure the horror of Helene 's death , he knew he could n't stay . He had to be home for Carol 's call . Pleading a load of unfinished work , he drove back to his apartment . After a late jog and a shower , Jason sat down with the printouts of all patients who 'd had GHP physicals in the last year . Feet on his desk , he went over the list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evenly among all the internists . Since the list had been printed in alphabetical order rather than chronologically , it took some time for Jason to realize that the poor predictive results were much more common in the last six months than in the beginning of the year . In fact , without graphing the material , it appearedp125that there had been a marked increase in unexpected deaths over the last few months . Taking a pencil , Jason began writing down the unit numbers of the recent deaths . He was shocked by the number . Then he called the main operator at GHP and asked to be connected to Records . When he had one of the night secretaries on the line , he gave the list of unit numbers and asked if the outpatient charts could be pulled and put on his desk . The secretary told him there would be no problem at all . Putting the computer printout back into his briefcase , Jason took down his Williams ' Textbook of Endocrinology and turned to the chapters on growth hormone . Like so many other subjects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Growth hormone and its relation to growth and sexual maturation was enormously complicated . So complicated , in fact , that he fell asleep , the heavy textbook pressing against his abdomen . The phone shocked him awake  --  so abruptly that he knocked the book to the floor . He snatched up the receiver , expecting his service . It took another moment before he realized the caller was Carol Donner . Jason looked at the time  --  eleven minutes to three . " I hope you were n't asleep , " Carol said . " No , no ! " Jason lied . His legs were stiff from being propped up on the desk . " I 've been waiting for your call . Where are you ? " " I 'm at home , " Carol said . " Can I come get that package ? " " It 's not here , " Carol said . " To avoid problems , I gave it to a friend who works with me . Her name is Melody Andrews . She lives at 69 Revere Street on Beacon Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 's expecting a call and should just be getting home . Let me know what you think of the material , and if there 's any trouble , here 's my number "  --  which she recited . " Thanks , " said Jason , writing everything down . He was surprised how disappointed he felt not to be seeing her . " Take care , " Carol said , hanging up . Jason remained at his desk , still trying to fully wake up . As he did so , he realized he had n't mentioned Helene 's death to Carol . Well , that might be a good excuse to call Carol back , he reflected as he dialed her friend 's number . Melody Andrews answered her phone with a strong South Boston accent . She told Jason that she had the package , and he was welcomep126to come over and get it . She said she 'd be up for another half hour or so . Jason put on a sweater and down vest , left the house , walked down Pinckney Street , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the left . He rang her bell , and she appeared at the door in pin curls . Jason did n't think anyone still used those things . Her face was tired and drawn . Jason introduced himself . Melody merely nodded and handed over a parcel wrapped in brown paper and tied with string . It weighed about ten pounds . When Jason thanked her she just shrugged and said , " Sure . " Returning home , Jason pulled off his vest and sweater . Eagerly eyeing the package , he got scissors from the kitchen and cut the string . Then he carried the package into the den and placed it on his desk . Inside he found two ledgers filled with handwritten instructions , diagrams , and experimental data . One of the books had Propertyof Gene , Inc. printed on the cover ; the other merely the word Notebook . In addition there was a large manila envelope filled with correspondence . The first letters Jason read were from Gene , Inc. , demanding that Hayes live up to his contractual agreements and return the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd illegally removed from their laboratory . As Jason continuedreading , it was apparent that Hayes had.a.signifacant difference QL.opinion concerning the ownership rocedure and the strain , and that he was in-the process of patenting the same . Jason also found a number of letters from an attorney by the name of Samuel Schwartz . Half of them involved the application for the patent on the. -Somatomedm-producing E cQJjand the rest dealt with the formation of a corporation . It seemed that Alvin Hayes owned fifty-one percent of the stock , while his children shared the other forty-nine percent along with Samuel Schwartz . So much for the correspondence , Jason thought . He returned the letters to the manila envelope . Next he took up the ledger books . The one that had " Gene , Inc. " on the cover seemed to be the protocol referred to in the correspondence . As Jason flipped through it , he realized **28;15868;TOOLONG of.therecombinant strain of bacteria to produce Somatomedin . From his reading , he knew thatp127Somatomedins were growth . factors produced by the liver cells in response to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jason picked up the second . The experimentsoutlined were incomplete , but they concerned the productionof a monoclonal antibody to a specific protein . The protein was not named , but - Jason found a diagram of its amino-acid sequence . Most of the material was beyond his comprehension , but it was clear from the crossing out of large sections and the scribbling in the margins that the work was not progressing well and that at the time of the last entry , Hayes had obviously not created the antibody he 'd desired . Stretching , Jason got up from his desk . He was disappointed . He had hoped the package from Carol would offer a clearer picture of Hayes 's breakthrough , but except for the documentation of the controversybetween Hayes and Gene , Inc. , Jason knew little more than he had before opening the package . He did have the protocol for producing the Somatomedin E. coli strain , but that hardly seemed a major discovery , and all the other lab book outlined was failure . Exhausted , Jason turned out the lights and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day.  |p128Nightmares  involving gross permutations of the terrible scene in Helene 's apartment drove Jason out of bed before the sun paled the eastern sky . He put on coffee and as he waited for it to filter through his machine , he picked up his paper and read about the double murder . There was nothing new . As he 'd expected , the emphasis was on the rape . Putting the Gene , Inc. , ledger in his briefcase , Jason started out for the hospital . At least there was no traffic at that early hour as he drove to the GHP , and he had his choice of parking places . Even the surgeons who usually arrived at such an uncivilized hour were not there yet . When he arrived at GHP , he went directly to his office . As he 'd requested , his desk was piled with charts . He took off his jacket and began to go through them . Keeping in mind these were patients who had died within a month of getting a fairly clean bill of health from doctors who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jason searched for commonalities . Nothing caught his eye . He compared EKGs and the levels of cholesterol , fatty acids , immunoglobulins , and blood counts . No . mammon-group of compounds , elements or enz1mesy fjed from the normal in any predictable pattern . The only **36;15898;TOOLONG ' deaths occurred within month of having-the physical. , More upsetting , Jason noticed , - was that .. the last three months the number of deaths increaseddramatically . Reading the twenty-sixth chart , one correlation suddenly occurred to Jason . Although the patients did not share physical symptoms , their charts she aved . &; tedominance of high risk social habits . They were sauer.weight , smoked heavily , used drugs , drank too much , and failedtQxerciseLo-r coinGrierd any and all of these unhealthy practices ; they were men and women who were eventually destined top129have severe medical problems . The shocking fact was that they deterioratedso quickly . And why the sudden upswing in deaths ? People were n't indulging in vices more than they were a year ago . Maybe it was a kind of statistical equalizing : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to them . But that did n't make a whole lot of sense , for there seemed to be too many deaths . Jason was not an experienced statistician , so he decided to ask a better mathematician than he was to look at the numbers . When he knew he would n't be waking the patients , Jason left his office and made rounds . Nothing had changed . Back in his office and before he saw the first scheduled patient , he called Pathology and inquired about the dead animals from Hayes 's lab , and waited severalminutes while the technician looked for the report . " Here it is , " the woman said . " They all died of strychnine poison-ing . " Jason hung up and called Margaret Danforth at the city morgue . A technician answered , since Margaret was busy doing an autopsy . Jason asked if the toxicology on Gerald Fan revealed anything interesting . " Toxicology was negative , " the tech said . " One more question . Would strychnine have shown up ? " " Just a moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the woman shouting to the medical examiner . She returned to the phone . " Dr. Danforth said yes , strychnine would have shown up if it had been present . " " Thank you , " Jason said . He hung up the phone , then stood up . At the window , he examined the developing day . He could see the traffic snarled on the River Way from his window . The sky was light but overcast . It was early November . Not a pretty month for Boston . Jason felt restless and anxious and disconsolate . He thought about the parcel from Carol and wondered if he should turn it over to Curran . Yet for what purpose ? They were n't even investigating Hayes except as a drug pusher . Walking back to the desk Jason took out his phone directory and looked up the phone number of Gene , Inc . He noted the company was located on Pioneer Street in East Cambridge next to the MIT campus . Impulsively , he sat down and dialed the number . The linep130was answered by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of the company . " You mean Dr. Leonard Dawen , the president ? " " Dr. Dawen will be fine , " Jason said . He heard the extension ring . It was picked up by a secretary . " Dr. Dawen 's office . " " I 'd like to speak to Dr. Dawen . " " Who may I say is calling ? " " Dr. Jason Howard . " " May I tell him what this is in reference to ? " " It 's about a lab book I have . Tell Dr. Dawen I 'm from the Good Health Plan and was a friend of the late Alvin Hayes . " " Just a moment , please , " the secretary said in a voice that sounded like a recording . Jason opened the center drawer to his desk and toyed with his collection of pencils . There was a click on the phone , then a powerful voice came over the line , " This is Leonard Dawen ! " Jason explained who he was and then described the lab book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir ? " " I do n't think that 's important . The fact is I have it . " He was not about to implicate Carol . " That book is our property , " Dr. Dawen said . His voice was calm but with a commanding and threatening undercurrent . " I 'll be happy to turn the book over in exchange for some information about Dr. Hayes . Do you think we might meet ? " " When ? " " As soon as possible , " Jason said . " I could get over just before lunch . " " Will you have the book with you ? " " I will indeed . " For the rest of the morning Jason had trouble concentrating on the steady stream of patients . He was pleased Sally had n't scheduled him through lunch . The minute he finished his last exam , he hurried out to his car . Reaching Cambridge , Jason threaded his way past MIT and among the new East Cambridge corporate skyscrapers , some with dramatically modern architecture that contrasted sharply with the older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final turn on Pioneer Street , Jason found Gene , Inc. , housed in ap131startlingly modern building of polished black granite . Unlike its neighbors , the structure was only six floors high . Its windows were narrow slits alternating with circles of bronze mirrored glass . It had a solid , powerful look , like a castle in a science fiction movie . Jason got out of his car with his briefcase and gazed up at the striking facade . After reading so much about recombinant DNA and seeing Hayes 's grossly deformed zoo , Jason was afraid he was about to enter a house of horrors . The front entrance was circular , defined by radiating spikes of granite , giving the illusion of a giant eye , the black doors being the pupil . The lobby was also black granite : walls , floor , even ceiling . In the center of the reception area was a dramaticallyilluminated Modern sculpture of the double helix DNA moleculeopening like a zipper . Jason approached an attractive Korean woman sitting behind a glass wall and in front of a control panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wore a tiny earpiece along with a small microphone that snaked around from behind her neck . She greeted Jason by name and told him he was expected in the fourthfloorconference room . Her voice had a metallic sound as she spoke into the microphone . The minute the receptionist stopped speaking , one of the granite panels opened , revealing an elevator . As he thanked her , Jason suddenlyfancied that she was a lifelike robot . Smiling , he boarded the elevator and looked for the floor buttons . The door closed behind him . There was no floor-selector panel , but the elevator started upward . When the doors reopened , Jason found himself in a doorless black foyer . He assumed the entire building was controlled from a central location , perhaps by the receptionist downstairs . To his left a granite panel slid open . Within the doorway stood a man with coarse features , impeccably dressed in a dark pinstripe suit , white shirt , and red paisley tie . " Dr. Howard , I 'm Leonard Dawen , " the man said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake hands . His voice had the same commanding quality Jason remembered from the phone conversation . Compared to the tomblike austerity of the rest of the building , the conference room looked more like a wood-paneled libraryand seemed positively cozy until you looked at the fourth wall , which was glass . It looked out on what appeared to be a large ultra/modern lab . There was another man in the room , an Oriental , wearing a white zippered jumpsuit . Dawen introduced the man as Mr. Hong , a Gene , Inc. , engineer . After they were all seated around a small conference table , Dawen said , " I assume you have the lab book .... " Jason opened his briefcase and handed the ledger to Dawen , who handed it to Hong . The engineer began studying it page by page . A heavy silence ensued . Jason looked back and forth between the two men . He 'd expected things to be a bit more cordial . After all , he was doing them a favor . He turned and peered through the glass wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . Much of the area was filled with stainless steel vats , reminding Jason of a visit he 'd once made to a brewery . He guessed they were the incubators for the culture of the recombinant bacteria . There was a lot of other equipment and complicatedpiping . People in white jumpsuits with white hoods were moving about checking gauges , making adjustments . Hong closed the lab book with a snap . " It seems complete , " he said . " That 's a nice surprise , " Dr. Dawen said . Turning to Jason he said , " I hope you realize everything in this book is confidential . " " Do n't worry , " Jason said , forcing a smile . " I did n't understand much of it . What I 'm interested in is Dr. Hayes . Just before he died he said he 'd made a major discovery . I 'm curious to know if what is described in those pages would be considered as such . " Dawen and Hong exchanged glances . " It 's more of a commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new technology here . " " That 's what I suspected . Hayes was so distraught I could n't tell if he was entirely rational . But , if he made a major breakthrough , I 'd hate to have it lost to humanity . " Dawen 's blunt features softened for the first time since Jason had arrived . Jason continued , directing his attention to the engineer . " Any idea what Hayes could have been talking about ? " " Unfortunately , no . Hayes was always rather secretive . " Dawen folded his hands on the table and looked directly at Jason . " We were afraid you were going to extort us with this material  --  make us pay to get it back , " he said , touching the cover of the lab book . " Youp133have to understand that Dr. Hayes had been giving us a rather difficulttime . " " What was Dr. Hayes 's role here ? " Jason asked . " We hired him to produce a recombinant strain of bacteria , " Dawen explained . " We wanted to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guessed that was the Somatomedin . " We agreed to pay him a flat fee for the project , as well as letting him use the Gene , Inc. , facilities for his own research . We have some very unique equipment . " " Any idea what his own research involved ? " Jason asked . Hong spoke up . " He spent most of his time isolating growth-factor proteins . Some of them exist in such minute quantities that the most sophisticated equipment is required to isolate them . " " Would the isolation of one of these growth factors be considered a major scientific discovery ? " Jason asked . " I ca n't see how , " Hong replied . " Even if they 've never been isolated , we know their effects . " Another dead end , Jason thought wearily . " There 's just one thing I remember that might be significant , " Hong said , pinching the bridge of his nose . " About three months ago Hayes got very excited about some side effect . He said it was ironic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Any idea what caused his excitement ? " he asked . Hong shook his head . " No , " he said , " but after that we did n't see him for a time . When we did see him , he said he 'd been to the Coast . Then he set up an elaborate extraction process on some material he 'd brought - back with - m . I do n't know if it worked , but then he abruptly switched to monoclonal antibody technology . At that point his excitement seemed to die . " The words " monoclonal antibody " reminded Jason of the second lab book , and he wondered if he should n't have brought it after all . Maybe Mr. Hong could have made more out of it than he had . " Did Dr. Hayes leave any other research material here ? " Jason asked . " Nothing significant , " Leonard Dawen answered . " And we checked carefully , because he 'd walked off with our lab book and the cultures . In fact , we were suing Dr. Hayes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strains that we 'd hired him to produce . " " Did you get your cultures back ? " Jason asked . " We did . " " Where did you find them ? " " Let 's say we looked in the right place , " Dawen said evasively . " But even though we have the strain , we still appreciate getting the protocol book back . On behalf of the company , I 'd like to thank you . I hope we have helped you in some small way . " " Perhaps , " Jason said vaguely . He had an idea he 'd inadvertently found out who had searched Hayes 's lab and apartment . But why would the scientists from Gene , Inc. , want to kill the animals ? He wondered if the huge animals had been treated with Gene , Inc. ' s , Somatomedin . " I appreciate your time , " he said to Dawen . " You have an impressive setup here . " " Thank you . Things are going well . We plan to have recombinant strains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigs and cows ? " " T ht . Genetically we can produce leaner digs , cows that produce-more milk , and chickens that have more protein , just to give you a few examples . " " Fascinating , " Jason said without enthusiasm . How far away could they be from genetically engineering people ? He shivered again , seeing Hayes 's outsized rats and mice , especially those with supernumerary eyes . Back in the car , Jason glanced at his watch . He still had an hour before the staff meeting being held to go over recent patient deaths , so he decided to visit Samuel Schwartz , Hayes 's attorney . Starting the car , Jason backed out of the Gene , Inc. , parking lot and worked his way over to Memorial Drive . He crossed the Charles River , stopping at Philip 's Drug Store on Charles Circle . Doubleparkingwith his emergency light blinking , he ran into the store and looked up Schwartz 's address . Ten minutes later he was in the lawyer'swaiting room , , flipping the pages of an outdated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glistening bakTliead . He m6  --  it Jason into his office as if he were directing traffic . Settling himself into his chair and adjusting his wire-rimmed glasses , he studied Jason , who had seated himself in front of the massive mahogany partner 's desk.  | " So you are a friend of the late Alvin Hayes . . . . " " We were more colleagues than friends . " " Whatever , " Schwartz said with another wave of his chubby hand . " So what can I do for you ? " Jason retold Hayes 's story of a purported breakthrough . He explained that he was trying to figure out what Hayes had been working on and had come across correspondence from Samuel Schwartz . " He was a client . So what ? " " No need to be defensive . " " I 'm not defensive . I 'm just bitter . I did a lot of work for that bum and I 'm going to have to write it all off . " " He never paid ? " " Never . He conned me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stock ? " Samuel Schwartz laughed without humor . " Unfortunately , now that Hayes is dead , the stock is worthless . It might have been worthlesseven if he had lived . I should have my head examined . " " Was Hayes 's corporation going to sell a service or a product ? " Jason asked .  --  - " A product . Hayes told me he was on the verge of developing the most valuable healtIi prod-trct  --  ever known . And I believed him . I figured a guy who 'd been on the cover of Time had to have something on the ball . " " Any idea what this product was ? " Jason asked , trying to keep the excitement out of his voice . " Not the foggiest . Hayes would n't tell me . " " Do you know if it involved monoclonal antibodies ? ' l . Jason asked , unwilling to give up . Schwartz laughed again . " I would n't know a monoclonal antibody if I walked into it . " " Malignancies ? " Jason was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's memory . " Could the product have involved a cancer treatment ? " The obese man shrugged  --  " I do n't know . Possibly . " " Hayes told someone that his discovery would enhance their beauty . Does that mean anything to you ? " " Listen , Dr. Howard . Hayes told me nothing about the product . I was just setting up the corporation . "  | " You were also applying for a patent . " " The patent had nothing to do with the corporation . That was to be in Hayes 's name . " Jason 's beeper startled both men . He watched the tiny screen . The word " urgent " blinked twice , followed by a number at the GHP hospital . " Would it be possible to use your phone ? " Jason asked . Schwartz pushed it across the desk . " Be my guest , doctor . " The call was from Madaline Krammer 's floor . She 'd arrested and they were giving her CPR . Jason said he 'd be right there . Thanking Samuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatiently waited for the elevator . When he got to Madaline 's room , he saw an all too familiar scene . The patient was unresponsive . Her heart refused to respond to anything , including external pacing . Jason insisted they continue life support while his mind went over various drugs and treatments , but after an hour of frantic activity , even he was forced to give up and he reluctantly called a halt to the proceedings . Jason remained at Madaline 's bedside after everyone else had left . She 'd been an old friend , one of the first patients he 'd treated in his private practice . One of the nurses had covered her face with a sheet . Madaline 's nose poked it up like a miniature snow-covered mountain . Gently , Jason turned it back . Even though she had been only in her early sixties , he could n't get over how old she looked . Since she 'd entered the hospital , her face had lost all its cheerful plumpness and taken on the skeletal cast of those nearing death . Needing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , avoidingboth Claudia and Sally , who each had a hundred , urgent questionsabout the upcoming conference and the problems of reschedulingso many patients . Jason locked his door and settled himself at his desk . As such an old patient , Madaline 's passing seemed like the severing of one more connection to Jason 's former life . Jason felt poignantly alone , fearful , yet relieved , that Danielle 's memory was receding . Jason 's phone rang , but he ignored it . He looked over his desk , which was a mass of stacked hospital charts of deceased patients , including Hayes 's . Involuntarily , Jason 's mind went back to the Hayes affair . It was frustrating that the package from Carol , which had held such hope , had added so little information . It did give a bitp137more credence to the idea Hayes had made a discovery that at least he thought was stupendous . Jason cursed Hayes 's secrecy . Leaning back , Jason put his hands behind his head and stared up at the ceiling . He was running out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oriental engineer 's comment that Hayes had brought something back-from the Coast presumably-Seattle- must have been a sample of something because Hayes had subjected it to a complicated extraction . process . From Hong 's comments , it seemed to Jason that Hayes had probably been isolating some kind of growth factor which would stimulate growth , or differentiation , or maturation , or all three . Jason came forward with a thump . Remembering that Carol had said Hayes had visited a colleague at the University of Washington , Jason suddenly entertained the idea that Hayes had obtained some kind of sample from the man . All at once , Jason decided he 'd go to Seattle , provided , of course , Carol would go along . She might . After all , she 'd be the key to finding this friend . Besides , a few days away sounded extremely therapeuticto Jason . With a little time left before the staff meeting , Jason decided to stop by and see Shirley . Shirley 's secretary at first insisted that her boss was too busy to see Jason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A moment later he was ushered inside . Shirley was on the phone . Jason took a seat , gradually catching the drift of the conversation . She was dealing with a union leader , handling the person with impressive ease . Absently she ran her fingers through her thick hair . It was a wonderfully feminine gesture , reminding Jason that underneath the professional surface was a very attractive woman , complicated but lovely . Shirley hung up and smiled . " This is a treat , " she said . " You are filled with surprises these days , are n't you , Jason ? I suppose you 're here to apologize for not having spent more time with me last night . " Jason laughed . Her directness was disarming . " Maybe so . But there 's something else . I 'm thinking of taking a few days off . I lost another patient this morning and I think I need some time away . " Shirley clicked her tongue in sympathy . " Was it expected ? " " I guess so . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted her I had no idea she was terminal . "  |p138Shirley  sighed . " I do n't know how you deal with this sort of thing . " " It 's never easy , " Jason agreed . " But what 's made it particularly hard lately is the frequency . " Shirley 's phone rang , but she buzzed her secretary to take a message . " Anyway , " Jason said , " I 've decided to take a few days off . " " I think it 's a good idea , " Shirley said . " I would n't mind doing the same if these damned union negotiations conclude . Where are you planning to go ? " " I 'm not sure , " Jason lied . The trip to Seattle was such a long shot that he was ashamed to mention it . " I have some friends who own a resort in the British Virgin Islands . I could give them a call , " Shirley offered . " No , thanks . I 'm not a sun person . What 's happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't remind me , " Shirley said . " To tell you the truth , I could n't face it . Bob Walthrow is handling that . " " I had nightmares all night , " admitted Jason . " Not surprising , " Shirley said . " Well , I 've got a meeting , " Jason said , getting to his feet . " Would you have time for dinner tonight ? " Shirley asked . " Maybe we can cheer each other up . " " Sure . What time ? " " Let 's say around eight . " " Eight it is , " Jason said , heading for the door . As he left , Shirley called after him . " I 'm really sorry about your patient . " The staff meeting was better attended than Jason had expected , given such short notice . Fourteen of the sixteen internists were there , and several had brought along their nurses . It seemed obvious they all recognized they were facing a serious problem . Jason started with the statistics that he 'd extracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month of a complete physical . He pointed out that the number of deaths had increased in the last three months , and said he was trying to check up on all GHP clients who 'd had executive physicals in the last sixty days.  | " Were the physicals evenly distributed among us ? " Roger Wanamaker asked . Jason nodded . A number of the doctors spoke out , making it clear they feared the start of a nationwide epidemic . No one could understand the connection with the physicals , and why the deaths were not being anticipated . The acting chief of cardiologr . Judith Rolander , tried to take much of the blame on herself , admitting that in most of the cases she 'd reviewed , the EKG done during the physical did not predict the imminent problems , even when she was armed with hindsight . The conversation then switched to stress testing as the main key to predicting catastrophic cardiac events . There were many opinions on this issue ; all were duly discussed . Upon recommendation from the floor , an ad hoc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their stress testing in hopes of increasing its prognostic value . Jerome Washington then took the floor . Getting heavily on his feet , he said , " I think we 're overlooking the significance of unhealthy lifestyles . That 's one factor that all these patients seem to share . " There were a few joking references to Jerome 's weight and his affection for cigars . " All right , you guys , " he said . " You know patientsshould do what we say and not what we do . " Everyone laughed . " Seriously , " he continued . " We all know the dangers of poor diet , heavy smoking , excess alcohol and lack of exercise . Such social factors have far more predictive value than a mild EKG ab-normality . " " Jerome is right , " Jason said . " The poor risk-factor profile was the only negative commonality I could find . " By a vote , it was decided to form a second committee to investigaterisk-factor contribution to the current problem and come up with specific recommendations . Harry Sarnoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , and Jason recognized him . When he got to his feet , he began to talk about noticing an increase in morbidity and mortality for his inpatients . Jason interrupted him . " Excuse me , Harry , " Jason said . " I can appreciate your concern , and frankly I 've had experience apparently similar to yours . However , this current meeting involves the problem with the outpatient executive physicals . We can schedule a second meeting if the stallp140desires to discuss any potential inpatient problem . They very well may be related . " Harry threw up his hands , and reluctantly sat back down . Jason then encouraged the staff to be sure to autopsy any patients who met unexpected deaths if the medical examiner did n't take them . Jason then told the audience that the results from the medical examiner 's office on s patients suggested that the people were sufferingmultisystem disease including extensive cardiovascular problems . Of course , that fact only undermined the concern that their conditions had not been picked up on either resting or exercise EKGs . Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meeting broke up , the doctors gravitated to smaller groups to discuss the problem . Jason collected his printout and searched for Roger Wanamaker . He was in an animated conversation with Jerome . " May I interrupt ? " Jason asked . The two men separated to allow Jason to join them . " I 'm about to leave town for a few days . " Roger and Jerome exchanged glances . Roger spoke : " Seems like a poor time to be leaving . " " I need it , " Jason said without elaborating . " But I have five patientsinhouse . Would either of you gentlemen be willing to cover ? I 'll admit right up front that they 're all pretty sick . " " Would n't much matter , " Roger said . " I 've been in here night and day trying to keep my own half dozen alive . I 'll be happy to cover . " With that problem solved , Jason went into his office and called Carol Donner , thinking late afternoon would be a good time to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to give up when she answered , out of breath . She told him she 'd been in the bath . " I want to see you tonight , " Jason said . " Oh , " Carol said noncommittally . She hesitated . " That might be difficult . " Then she added angrily , " Why did n't you tell me about Helene Brennquivist last night ? I read in the paper that you were the one who found the bodies . " " I 'm sorry , " Jason said defensively . " To be perfectly honest , you woke me last night and all I could think about was the package . " " Did you get it ? " Carol asked , her voice softening . " I did , " Jason said . " Thank you . " " And ... ? "  | " The material was n't as enlightening as I 'd hoped . " " I 'm surprised , " said Carol . " The ledgers must have been importantor Alvin would n't have asked me to keep them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing about Helene . My boss is so distressedhe wo n't let me go anywhere without one of the club bouncers . He 's outside the building at this very moment . " " It 's important that I see you alone , " Jason said . " I do n't know if I can . This behemoth takes orders from my boss , not me . And I do n't want any trouble . " " Well , call me the minute you get home , " Jason said . " Promise ! We 'll think of something . " " It 'll be late again , " Carol warned . " That does n't matter . It 's important . " " All right , " Carol agreed before hanging up . Jason made one more call , to United Airlines , and checked on service from Boston to Seattle . He learned there was a daily flight at four P.M.Gathering his stethoscope , Jason left his office and headed for the hospital to make rounds . He knew he needed to thoroughly update his charts if Roger was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , and Jason was disturbed to find that another patienthad developed advanced cataracts . Troubled , he arranged an ophthalmologyconsult . This time he was certain he had n't noticed the problem on admission . How could the cataracts have progressed so far so fast ? At home , he changed into jogging clothes and ran a good hour , trying to sort out his thoughts . By the time he showered , changed , and drove over to Shirley 's , he was in a better mood . Shirley outdid herself with the dinner , and Jason began to think she 'd fit into the Superwoman category . She 'd worked all day runninga multimillion-dollar company and conducting crucial union negotiations , yet somehow she 'd gotten home , put together a fabulousfeast of roast duck with fresh pasta and artichoke . And on top of that she 'd dressed herself in a black silk chemise that would have been appropriate for the opera . Jason felt embarrassed that he 'd put on jeans and a rugby shirt over a turtleneck after his shower . " You wore what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a laugh . She gave him a Kir Royale and told him to wash the radicchiop142Ind the arugula for their salad . She checked the duck and said it was about done . To Jason , it smelled heavenly . V.-they ate in the dining room , sitting at opposite ends of a long table with six empty chairs on either side . Every time Jason poured more wine , he had to get up and walk several steps . Shirley thought it was amusing . As they ate , Jason described the staff meeting and added that all the doctors were going to intensify the quality of their stress testing . Shirley was pleased , reminding Jason that the executive physical was an important part of GHP 's sales pitch to corporate clients . She told Jason that there would be a new emphasis on preventive medicine for executive customers . Later , over coffee , she said , " Michael Curran came by this after-noon . " " Really , " said Jason . " I 'm sure that was unpleasant . What did he want ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything we had . He even interviewed the woman in personnel who 'd hired her . " " Did he mention if they had any suspects ? " " He did n't say , " Shirley said . " I just hope it 's all over . " " I wish I 'd gotten to talk with Helene again . I still think she was covering for Hayes . " " Do you still think he discovered something ? " " Absolutely . " Jason went on to describe the lab ledgers and his visit to Gene , Inc. , and to Samuel Schwartz . He told Shirley that Schwartz had set up a corporation for Hayes that was to market thenewdiccovery , .. w iaiev-r it was . ' " Did n't the lawyer know what the product was ? " " Nope . Apparently Hayes trusted no one . " " But he would have needed seed capital . He would have had to trust someone if he was planning to manufacture and distribute . " " Maybe so , " Jason admitted . " But I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , Helene was the best bet . " " Are you still looking ? " " I guess so , " he admitted . " Does that sound stupid ? " " Not stupid , " Shirley said , " just disturbing . It would be a tragedy if an important discovery were lost , but I definitely think it 's time top143put the Hayes affair to rest . I hope you 're taking time off to relax , not to continue this wild-goose chase . " " Now why would you suggest that ? " Jason asked , surprised at his own transparency . " Because you do n't give up easily . " She moved over and put her hand on his shoulder . " Why do n't you go to the Caribbean ? Maybe I could get away over the weekend and join you .... " Jason experienced an excitement he 'd not felt since Danielle 's death . The idea of the hot sun and cool , clear water sounded wonderful , especially if Shirley were there too . But then he hesitated . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would entail . And , more important , he 'd promised himself he 'd visit Seattle . " I want to go out to the West Coast , " he said finally . " There 's an old friend out there I 'd like to see . " " That sounds innocent enough . But the Caribbean sounds better to me . " " Maybe soon . " He gave Shirley 's arm a squeeze . " How about a cognac ? " As Shirley got up to get the Courvoisier , Jason studied her figure with increasing interest . When Carol called at two-thirty in the morning , Jason was wide awake . He 'd been so worried that she might forget , he had n't been able to sleep . " I 'm exhausted , Jason , " Carol announced , instead of saying hello . " I 'm sorry , but I must see you , " he said . " I can be over in ten minutes . " " I do n't think that would be a good idea . As I told you this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside watching my building . Why do you have to see me tonight ? Maybe we can work something out tomorrow . " Jason thought about asking her on the phone to go to Seattle , but decided he 'd have a better chance convincing her in person . It was a bit out of the ordinary asking a young woman to accompany him to Seattle after only two meetings . " Is this bodyguard alone ? " " Yes . But what difference does that make ? The guy 's built like an ox . "  | " There 's an alley in back of your building . I could come up the fire escape . " The fire escape ! This is crazy ! What on earth is so important that you have to see me tonight ? " " If I told you , I would n't have to see you . " " Well , I 'm not crazy about men coming to my apartment at night . " Oh , sure , Jason thought . " Look , " he said aloud , " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure out what Hayes could have discoveredand I 'm down to my last idea . I need your help . " " That 's quite a line , Dr. Jason Howard . " " It 's true . You 're the only one who can help me . " Carol laughed . " When you put it that way , who could refuse ? All right , come along . But you 're coming at your own risk . I have to warn you , I do n't have much control over Atlas outside . " " My disability insurance is all paid up . " " I live at . . . " Carol began . " I know where you live , " Jason interrupted . " In fact , I 've already had a run-in with Bruno , if that 's the charming fellow guarding your door . " " You 've met Bruno ? " Carol asked incredulously . " Lovely man . Such a wonderful conversationalist . " " Let me warn you , then , " Carol said . " It was Bruno who walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spot . Watch out your back window . I do n't want to be stranded on your fire escape . " " This is really insane , " Carol said . Jason changed into a dark slacks and sweater . He 'd be visible enough on the fire escape without wearing light colors . He donned running shoes and went down to his car . Driving along Beacon Street , he kept an eye out for Bruno . He went left on Gloucester Street and left again on Commonwealth . When he crossed Marlborough , he slowed . He knew there was no chance to find a parking place , so he pulled in at the nearest hydrant . He left the doors unlocked ; if need be the firemen could run the hoses right through the car . Getting out of his car , Jason peered down the alleyway between Beacon and Marlborough streets . Intermittent lights formed pools of illumination . There were lots of dark areas , and trees threw spider/weblike shadows . Jason could vividly remember his last attempted flight from Bruno down the same alley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as tense as a sprinter waiting for the starting gun . A sudden movement to his left made him gasp . It was a rat the size of a small cat , and Jason felt the hairs on the back of his neck spring up . He kept walking , happy to see no sign of Bruno . It was so quiet he could hear his breathing . Arriving at Carol 's building , he noted the familiar light in the fourth-floor window before taking a good look at the fire escape . Unfortunately , it had one of those ladder mechanisms that have to be lowered from the first floor . Jason glanced around for something to stand on . The only thing available was a trash can , and that meant turning it over and dumping it . Despite the fact it would make a lot of noise , he realized he had no choice . But he shuddered as the metal clanged against the pavement and a number of beer cans clattered down the street . Holding his breath , he looked up . No lights had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can and got hold of the lowest rung of the raised ladder . " Hey ! " someone yelled . Jason 's head turned and he saw a familiar bulky figure coming down the alley on the run , his thick arms pumping , his breaths coming in puffs like a steam engine . At that moment Bruno looked like a fullback for the Washington Redskins . " Shit , " Jason said . With all his strength he pulled himself up on the ladder , half expecting it to drop under his weight . Luckily it did n't . Hand over hand , he lifted himself until he could put his foot on the first rung and scamper up to the first floor . " Hey , you goddamned little pervert ! " Bruno was yelling . " You get the hell down here ! " Jason hesitated . He could hold the man off by stepping on his fingers if he tried to come up , but that would n't get him in to see Carol . And somebody would call the police if there were enough ruckus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next two flights of the fire escape , arriving at Carol 's window . She was looking out and raised the sash the second she spotted him . Before she could speak , Jason gasped , " Your neo-Nazi is on his way up . Do you think he has a gun ? " Jason found himself standing in a large kitchen . " I do n't know . " " He 's going to be here in a moment , " Jason said , slamming downp146the window and locking it . That was going to delay Bruno just about ten seconds . " Maybe I should talk to him , " Carol suggested . " Will he listen ? " " I 'm not sure . He 's kinda bullheaded ... . " " That 's my impression , " Jason said . " And I know he 's not fond of me . I think I need something like a baseball bat . " " You ca n't hit him , Jason . " " I do n't want to , but I do n't think Bruno wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to threaten him with to keep him away from me . " " I have a fire poker . " " Get it . " Jason turned the light out in the kitchen . Putting his nose to the glass , he could see Bruno struggling to pull himself onto the first ladder . He was strong but he was also bulky . Carol returned with the fire poker . Jason hefted it . With a little luck he might be able to convince the guy to listen . " I knew this was a bad idea , " Carol said . Jason glanced around the room and noticed that the floor was oldfashionedlinoleum . He looked at the door leading from the kitchen to the rest of the apartment . It was thick and solid , with a lock and key . At one point the room had been something other than a kitchen . " Carol , would you mind if I made a mess ? I mean , I 'll be happy to pay to have it cleaned up . " " What are you talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetable oil ? " " I suppose . " " Can I have it ? " Perplexed , Carol opened the pantry door and lifted out a gallon can of imported Italian olive oil . " Perfect , " Jason said . After another quick check out the window , he hurriedly pulled the two chairs and table out of the kitchen . Carol watched him with growing confusion . " Okay , out , " Jason ordered . Carol stepped into the hall . Jason uncorked the olive oil and began pouring the contents over the floor in wide , sweeping movements . As he closed and locked the door , he heard banging on the kitchen window , followed by the crash of glass.  |p147He  wedged the kitchen table between the door and the opposite hall . " Come on , " he said , taking Carol 's hand . In his other he still held the poker . He led her to the front door of the apartment , which was adequately secured with double latches and a metal-pole police lock . In the kitchen they heard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " That was ingenious , " laughed Carol . " When you 're one hundred and sixty pounds , you have to compensate . " Jason 's heart was still racing . " Anyway , I have no idea how long Bruno will be entertained in there , so this has to be fast . I need you . The last chance I have of reconstructing Alvin Hayes 's discovery is to go to Seattle and try to find out what he did there . Apparently , he ... " There was another crash followed by a volley of swear words , some of which were appropriately in Italian . " He 's going to be in a foul mood , " Jason said as he undid the locks on the front door . " So you want me to go to Seattle with you . That 's what this is all about ? " " I knew you 'd understand . Hayes brought back a biological samplefrom there , which he processed at Gene , Inc . I have to find out what it was . The best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Washington . " " The man whose name I ca n't remember . " " But you saw him and could recognize him ? " " Probably . " " I know it 's presumptuous to ask you to come , " Jason said . " But Ireally do believe Hayes made some sort of breakthrough . And consideringhis previous track record , it has to be significant . " " And you really think going to Seattle might solve it ? " " It 's a long shot . But the only one left . " The door to the kitchen rattled and they heard Bruno begin a steady pounding . " I think I 've overstayed my welcome , " Jason said . " Bruno wo n't hurt you , will he ? " " Heavens , no . My boss would skin him alive . That 's why he 's so rabid now . He thinks I 'm in danger . "  | " Carol , would you come with me to Seattle ? " Jason asked while removing the pole to the police lock . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vacillating . " Late today . We would n't stay long . Would it be possible for you to get off on short notice ? " " I have in the past . I just say I want to go home . Besides , after Helene 's murder my boss might be relieved to have me out of town . " " Then say you 'll go ? " Jason pleaded . " All right . " Carol gave him one of her heartwarming smiles . " Why not ? " " There 's a flight to Seattle at four this afternoon . We 'll meet at the gate . I 'll get the tickets . How does that sound ? " " Insane , " Carol said , " but fun . " " See you there . " Jason ran down the stairs to his car , fearful that Bruno might have reversed direction and gone back out the window.  |p149Jason  woke early and called Roger to brief him on his patients . He was n't going to the hospital today . He had another trip he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Seattle . He packed quickly , being careful to take clothes for rainy , chilly weather , and called a cab to the airport , getting there just in time to store his bag in a locker and take the ten o'clock Eastern shuttle to La Guardia . At La Guardia he rented a car and drove to Leonia , New Jersey . It was probably even less of a possibility than Seattle , but Jason was going to see Hayes 's former wife . He was not about to leave even the smallest stone unturned . Leonia turned out to be a surprisingly sleepy little town that belied its proximity to New York . Within ten minutes of the George WashingtonBridge , he found himself on a wide street lined with one-story commercial establishments fronted by angled parking . It could have been Main Street , USA . Instead , it was called Broad Avenue . There was a drugstore , a hardware store , a bakery , and even a luncheonette . It looked like a movie set from the fifties . Jason went into the luncheonette , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a Louise Hayes on Park Avenue . While he drank his malted , Jason debated the wisdom of calling or just dropping by . He opted for the latter . Park Avenue bisected Broad and rose up the hillside that bordered Leonia on the east . After Pauline Boulevard , it arched to the north . That was where Jason found Louise Hayes 's house . It was a modest , dark-brown , shingled structure , much in need of repair . The grass in the front yard had gone to seed . Jason rang the bell . The door was opened by a smiling , middleagedwoman in a faded red housedress . She had stringy brown hair ,  |p150and  a little girl of five or six , a thumb buried to the second knuckle in her mouth , clung to her thigh . " Mrs. Hayes ? " Jason asked . The woman was a far cry from Hayes 's two other girlfriends . " Yes . " " I 'm Dr. Jason Howard , a colleague of your late husband . " He 'd not rehearsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Hayes repeated , reflexly pushing the young girl behind her . " I 'd like to talk to you if you have a moment . " Jason took out his wallet and handed over his driver 's license with its photo and his GHP staff identity card . " I went to medical school with your husband , " he added for good measure . Louise looked at the cards and handed them back . " Would you like to come in ? " " Thank you . " The interior of the house also looked in need of work . The furniture was worn and the carpet was threadbare . Children 's toys littered the floor . Louise hastily cleared a spot on the couch and motioned for Jason to sit down . " Can I offer you something ? Coffee , tea ? " " Coffee would be nice , " he said . The woman seemed anxious , and he thought the activity would calm her . She went into the kitchen , where Jason could hear the sound of running water . The little girl had hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jasonsmiled at her , she fled into the kitchen . Jason gazed around the room . It was dark and cheerless , with a few mail-order prints on the walls . Louise returned with her daughterin tow . She gave Jason a mug of coffee and placed sugar and cream on the small coffee table . Jason helped himself to both . Louise sat down across from Jason . " I 'm sorry if I did n't seem hospitable at first , " she said . " I do n't have many visitors asking about Alvin . " " I understand , " Jason said . He looked at her more carefully . Underneaththe frowsy exterior , Jason could see the shadow of an attractive woman . Hayes had good taste , that was 4or sure . " I 'm sorry to barge in like this , but Alvin had spoken of you . Since I was in the area I thought I 'd drop by . " He thought a few untruths might help . " Did he ? " Louise said indifferently.  |p151Jason  decided to be careful . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason I wanted to talk to you , " he said , " is that your husbandtold me he 'd made an important scientific discovery . " Jason went on to explain the circumstances of Alvin Hayes 's death , and how he , Jason , had made it a personal crusade to try to find out if her husband had indeed made a scientific breakthrough . He explained that it would be a tragedy if Alvin had come across something that could help mankind , only to have it lost . Louise nodded , but when Jason asked if she had any idea of what the discovery could have been , she said she did n't . " You and Alvin did n't speak much ? " " No . Only about the children and financial matters . " " How are your children ? " Jason asked , remembering Hayes 's concernabout his son . " They are both fine , thank you . " " Two ? " " Yes , " Louise said . " Lucy here "  --  she patted her daughter 's head  --  " and John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three children . " Jason saw the woman 's eyes film over . After an uncomfortable silence she said , " Well . . . there is another . Alvin Junior . He 's severelyretarded . He ijyes " aLa hpol in Boston . " " I ; m sOr y. , , " It 's all right . You 'd think I 'd have adjusted by now , but I guess I never will . I guess it was the reason Alvin and I got divorced  --  I could n't deal with it . " " Where exactly is Alvin Junior ? " Jason asked , knowing he was probing a painful area . " At the Hartford School . " " How is he doing ? " Jason knew of the Hartford School . It was an institution acquired by GHP when the corporation purchased an associated acute-care proprietary hospital . Jason also knew the school was for sale . It was a money-loser for GHP . " Fine , I guess , " Louise said . " I 'm afraid I do n't visit too often . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jason said , wondering if this was the son Hayes had been referring to the night he died . " Would it be possible for us to call and inquire how the boy is doing ? "  | " I suppose , " Louise said , not reacting to the extraordinary nature of the question . She got stiffly to her feet and , with her daughter still clinging to her , went to the telephone and called the school . She asked for the pre-teen dormitory and , when they answered , talked for a while about her son 's condition . When she hung up , she said , " They feel he 's doing as well as can be expected . The only new problem is some arthritis , which has interfered with his physical therapy . " " Has he been there long ? " " Just since Alvin went to work for GHP . Being able to place Alvin Junior at Hartford was one of the reasons he accepted the job . " " And your other son ? You say he 's fine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious pride . " He 's in the third grade and considered one of the brightest in the class . " " That 's wonderful , " Jason said , trying to think back to the night Hayes died . Alvin had said that someone wanted him and his son dead . That it was too late for him but maybe not for his son . What on earth had he meant ? Jason had assumed one of his sons had been physically sick , but apparently that was not the case . " More coffee ? " Louise asked . " No , thank you , " Jason said . " There 's just one more thing I wanted to ask . At the time of his death , Alvin was involved in setting up a corporation . Your children were to be stockholders . Did you know anything at all about that ? " " Not a thing . " " Oh , well , " Jason said . " Thanks for the coffee . If there 's anything I can do for you in Boston , like look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He got up and the little girl buried her head in Louise 's skirt . " I hope Alvin did n't suffer , " sLe said . " No , he did n't , " Jason lied . He could still remember the look of agony on Alvin 's face . They were at the door when Louise suddenly said , " Oh , there 's one thing I did n't tell you . A few days after Alvin died , someone broke in here . Luckily we were out . " " Was anything taken ? " Jason wondered if it could have been Gene , Inc . " No , " Louise said . " They probably saw the usual mess and justp153moved on . " She smiled . " But they seemed to have searched through everything . Even the children 's bookcases . " As Jason drove out of Leonia , New Jersey , and made his way back to the George Washington Bridge , he thought about his meeting with Louise Hayes . He should have been more discouraged than he was . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justified the trip . But he realized there had been more to his wanting to go . He 'd been genuinely curious about Hayes 's wife . Having had his own wife rudely taken away from him , Jason could n't understand why someonelike Hayes would split up voluntarily . But Jason had never experiencedthe trauma of a retarded child . Jason was able to catch the two o'clock afternoon shuttle back to Boston . He tried to read on the plane , but could n't concentrate . He began to worry that Carol would n't meet him at the Boston airport , or , worse yet , that she 'd show up with Bruno . Unfortunately , the two o'clock shuttle that was supposed to land in Boston at two-forty did n't even leave La Guardia until two-thirty . By the time Jason got off the plane it was three-fifteen . He got his luggage from the locker and ran from the Eastern terminal over to United . There was a long line at the ticket window , and Jason could n't imagine what the airline agents were doing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to four and no sign of Carol Donner . At last it was Jason 's turn . He tossed over his American Express card , asking for two round-trip tickets to Seattle for the flight leaving at four , with open returns . At least with Jason the agent was efficient . Within three minutes Jason had the tickets and boarding cards and was running for Gate 19 . It was now five minutes to four . The flight was in the final stages of boarding . Arriving at Gate 19 , Jason breathlessly asked if anyone had asked for him . When the girl at the desk said no , he quickly described Carol and asked if the agent had seen her . " She 's very attractive , " he added . " I 'm sure she is , " smiled the agent . " Unfortunately , I have n't noticedher . But if you are planning to go to Seattle you 'd better board . " Jason watched the second hand sweep around the face of the wall clock behind the check-in counter . The agent was busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the departureto Seattle . It was two minutes before four . With his carry-on bag draped over his shoulder , Jason looked up the concourse toward the terminal proper . At the point he was about to give up all hope , he saw her . She was running in his direction . Jason should have been elated . The only problem was that a few steps behind her was the impressive hulk of Bruno . Farther down the hall was a policeman , lounging at the point where bags were picked up from the X-ray machine . Jason made a mental note : that would be his direction of flight if the need arose . With her own carry-on shoulder bag , Carol was having some difficultyrunning . Bruno made no attempt to assist her . Carol came directly up to Jason . Jason saw the expression on Bruno 's broad face go from vexation to confusion to anger . " Did I make it ? " she panted . The agent was now at the door to the jetway , kicking out the doorstop . " What the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lookingup at the destination sign . He turned accusingly on Carol . " You said you were going home , Carol . " " Come on , " Carol urged , grasping Jason 's arm and pulling him toward the jetway . Jason stumbled backward , his eyes on Bruno 's pudgy face , which had turned an unattractive shade of red . The veins in his temple swelled to the size of cigars . " Just a moment ! " Carol called to the agent . The agent nodded and shouted something down the jetway . Jason watched Bruno until the very last seconds He saw him lumber over to a bank of telephones . " You people like to cut it close , " the agent said , ripping off a part of each boarding card . Jason finally turned to face ahead , at last convinced that Bruno had decided not to cause a scene . Carol was still pulling Jason 's arm as they descended the jetway . They had to wait while the jetway operator pounded on the side of the plane to get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is about as close as you can make it , " he said , frowning . Once they were seated , Carol apologized for being late . " I 'm furious , " she said , jamming her carry-on under the seat ahead of her . " I appreciate Arthur 's concern for my well-being , but this is ridicu-lous. "  | " Who 's Arthur ? " " He 's my boss , " Carol said disgustedly . " He told me if I left now he might actually fire me . I think I 'll quit when we get back . " " Would you be able to do that ? " Jason asked , wondering just what Carol 's work involved besides dancing . It was his understanding that women like Carol lost control of their lives . " I was planning on stopping soon anyway , " said Carol . The plane lurched as it was towed backwards out of the gate . " You do know what kind of work I do ? " Carol asked . " Well , sort of , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Carol said . " Most people bring it up . " I figured it was your business , " Jason said . Who was he to judge ? " You 're a little strange , " Carol said , " likable but strange . " " I thought I was pretty normal , " Jason said . " Ha ! " Carol said playfully . There was a good bit of air traffic and they waited for over twenty minutes before they lifted off the ground and headed west . " I did n't think we were going to make it , " Jason said , finally beginning to relax . " I 'm sorry , " Carol said again . " I tried to lose Bruno , but he stuck like glue . I did n't want him to know I was n't heading back to Indiana . But what could I do ? " " It does n't matter , " Jason said , although in the back of his mind it disturbed him that anyone but Shirley knew where he was going . He 'd meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't figure out how it would make any difference . Taking notes on a yellow pad , Jason began quizzing Carol as to Hayes 's schedule on each of his two trips to Seattle . The first visit was the more interesting . They 'd stayed at the Mayfair Hotel and among other things had visited a club called the Totem , similar to the Cabaret in Boston . He asked her what it was like . " It was okay , " Carol said , " nothing special . But it did n't have the excitement of the Club Cabaret . Seattle seems a bit conservative . " Jason nodded , wondering why Hayes would waste his time at a place like that when he was traveling with Carol . " Did Alvin talk to anyone there ? " he asked . " Yes . Arthur arranged for him to speak to the owner . " " Your boss did ? Did Alvin know your boss ? "  | " They were friends . That was how I met Alvin . " Jason recalled the rumors about Alvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been true . But the idea of a world-famous molecular biologist being chummy with a man who managed a toplessbar seemed ludicrous . " Do you know what Alvin spoke to this man about ? " " No , I do n't , " Carol said . " They did n't talk very long . I was busy watching the dancers . They were quite good . " " And you visited the University of Washington , correct ? " " That 's right . We did that the first day . " " And you think you can find the man Alvin saw there ? " Jason asked , just to be sure . " I think so . He was a tall , good-looking fellow . " " And then what ? " " We went up into the mountains . " " And that was vacation time ? " " I suppose . " " Did Alvin meet anyone up there ? " " No one in particular . But he talked to a lot of people . " Jason settled back after the cocktail service . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most critical event was the visit to the University of Washington . But the visit to the club was also curious and deserved to be checked out . " One d.her thing , " Carol said . " On the second trip we had to spend some time looking for dry ice . " " Dry ice ? What on earth for ? " " I did n't know and Alvin did n't tell me . Alvin had a cooler and he wanted it full of dry ice . " Perhaps to transport the specimen , Jason thought . This sounds promising . When they touched down in Seattle , they dutifully changed their watches to Pacific Coast time . Jason looked out the airplane window . True to expectations , it was raining . He could see the drops in the darkened pools of water on the runway . Soon , even the window was streaked with moisture . They rented a car and once they were clear of the airport traffic , Jason said , " In case it helps your memory , I thought we 'd stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms , of course . "  |p157Carol  turned to eye him in the half-light of the car . Jason wanted it very clear this trip was all business . Two cars behind Jason and Carol was a dark blue Ford Taurus . Behind the wheel was a middle-aged man dressed in a turtleneck sweater , suede jacket , and checked slacks . He 'd gotten a call only about five hours earlier to meet the United flight from Boston . He was supposed to spot a forty-five-year-old doctor who 'd be arriving with a beautiful young woman . The names were Howard and Donner , and he was to keep them under surveillance . The operation had been easier than he 'd expected . He 'd confirmed their identity simply by coming up behind them at the Avis counter . Now all he had to do was keep them in sight . Supposedly he 'd be contacted by somebody who 'd be coming from Miami . For this he was being paid his usual fifty dollars an hour plus expenses . He wondered if it were some kind of domestic problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual disheveled appearance , Jason would n't have expected the man to have such expensivetastes . They got separate rooms , but Carol insisted they open the connecting door . " Let 's not be prudish , " she said . Jason did n't know how to take that . Since they 'd barely touched the airplane food , Jason suggested they have dinner before heading out to the Totem Club . Carol changed , and as they entered the dining room , Jason was pleased at how young and lovely she looked . The maitre d ' even checked her ID when Jason ordered a bottle of California chardonnay . The episodethrilled Carol , who complained of looking as if she were already over the hill at age twenty-five . By ten P.M. , one o'clock East Coast time , they were ready to leave for the Totem Club . Jason was already beginning to feel sleepy , but Carol felt fine . To avoid difficulty , they left the rental car in the hotel parking lot and took a taxi . Carol admitted she had trouble finding the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downtown area of Seattle , on the border of a pleasant residential neighborhood . There was none of the sordid color of the Boston Combat Zone . The club was surrounded by a large asphalt parking area that was n't even littered , and there were no street people panhandling . It looked like any res/taurant or bar , except for several ersatz totem poles flanking the entrance . When Jason got out of the car , he could feel the beat of the rock music . They ran through the rain to the entrance . Inside , the club seemed much more conservative than the Cabaret . The first thing Jason noticed was that the crowd consisted mostly of couples rather than the heavy-drinking men who lined the runway in Boston . There was even a small dance floor . The only real similarity was the configuration of the bar , which was also U-shaped with a runway for the dancers in the center . " They do n't dance topless here , " Carol whispered . They were shown to a booth on the first level , away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waitress placed a cardboard coaster in front of each and asked for their drink order . After they 'd been served , Jason asked if Carol saw the owner . At first she did n't , but after a quarter hour she grasped Jason 's arm and leaned across the table . " There he is . " She pointed to a young man , probably in his early thirties , dressed in a tuxedo with a red tie and cummerbund . He had olive skin and thick blue-black hair . " Do you remember his name ? " She shook her head . Jason eased out from the booth and walked toward the owner , who iad a friendly , boyish face . As Jason came up to him , he laughed and patted the back of a man sitting at the bar . " Excuse me , " Jason said . " I 'm Dr. Jason Howard . From Boston . " The owner turned to him . He wore a plastic smile . Sebastion Frahn , " the owner said . " Welcome to the Totem . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The man 's smile waned . " What 's on your mind ? " " It will take a minute or two to explain . " " I 'm awfully busy . Maybe later . " Unprepared for such a quick brush-off , Jason stood for a moment watching Frahn move among his customers . His smile had immediatelyreturned . " Any luck ? " Carol asked when Jason returned to their booth and sat down again . " None . Three thousand miles and the guy wo n't talk to me . " " People have to be careful in this business . Let me try . " Without waiting for Jason 's reply , she slid from the booth . Jasonp159watched her gracefully make her way over to the owner . She touched his arm and spoke briefly . Jason saw him nod , then gaze in his direction . The man nodded again and moved off . Carol returned . " He 'll be over in a minute . " " What did you say ? " " He remembered me , " Carol said simply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hayes ? " " Oh , yes , " Carol said . " No problem . " Sure enough , within ten minutes Sebastion Frahn made a swing around the room and stopped at their table . " Sorry to have been so curt . I did n't know you people were friends . " " That 's all right , " Jason said . He did n't know exactly what the man meant , but it sounded cordial . " What can I do for you ? " " Carol says you remember Dr. Hayes . " Sebastion turned to Carol . " Was that the man you were here with last time ? " he asked . Carol nodded . " Sure I remember him . He was a friend of Arthur Koehler . " " Do you think you could tell me what you talked about ? It might be important . " " Jason worked with Alvin , " Carol interjected . " I do n't have any problem at all telling you what we discussed . The man wanted to go salmon fishing . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he wanted to catch some big chums but he did n't want to drive too far . I told him to go to Cedar Falls . " " Was that all ? " Jason asked , his heart sinking . " We talked about the Seattle Supersonics for a few minutes . " " Thank you , " Jason said . " I appreciate your time . " " Not at all , " Sebastion said with a smile . " Well , got to circulate . " He stood up , shook hands , and told them to come back again . Then he moved off . " I ca n't believe it , " Jason said . " Every time I think I have a lead , it turns out to be a joke . Fishing ! " At Carol 's request they stayed for another half hour to watch the show , and by the time they got back to the hotel , Jason was totally exhausted . By East Coast time it was four o'clock Thursday morn/ing . Jason got ready for bed and climbed between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the results of his visit to the Totem Club , but there was still the University of Washington . He was about to drop off to sleep when there was a soft knock on the connecting door . It was Carol . She said she was starving and could n't sleep . Could they order room service ? Feeling obliged to be a good sport , Jason agreed . They ordered a split of champagne and a plate of smoked salmon . Carol sat on the edge of Jason 's bed in a terrycloth robe , eating salmon and crackers . She described her childhood growing up outside of Bloomington , Indiana . Jason had never heard her talk so much . She 'd lived on a farm and had to milk cows before going to school in the morning . Jason could see her doing that . She had that freshness about her that suggested such a life . What he had trouble with was relating that former life to her current one . He wanted to know how things got on the wrong track , but he was afraid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might , he could not keep his eyes open . He fell asleep and Carol , after covering him with a blanket , returned to her own room.  |p161Awakening  with a start , Jason checked his watch , which said five A.M. That meant eight in Boston , the time he usually left for the hospital . He opened the drapes and looked out on a crystal-clear day . In the distance a ferry was making its way across Puget Sound towardSeattle , leaving a sparkling wake . After showering , Jason knocked on the adjoining door . There was no answer . He knocked again . Finally he opened it a crack , allowing a swath of bright sunlight to fall into the cool , darkened room . Carol was still fast asleep , clutching her pillow . Jason watched her for a moment . She looked angelically lovely . Silently , he closed the door so as to not waken her . He went back to his bed , dialed room service , and ordered fresh orange juice , coffee , and croissants for two . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Not quite , " Roger admitted . " Marge Todd threw a big embolus last night . She went into a coma and died . Respiratory arrest . " " My God , " Jason said . " Sorry to be the bearer of sad tidings , " Roger said . " Try to enjoy yourself . " " I 'll give you a call in a day or so , " Jason said . Another death . Except for one young woman with hepatitis , he was beginning to think the only way his patients could leave the hospital was feetfirst . He wondered if he should fly directly back to Boston . Yet Roger was right . There was nothing he could do , and he might as well see the Hayes business through , even though he was n't very optimistic . Two hours later Carol knocked at the door and came in , her hairp162still wet from the shower . " Top of the morning , " she said in her cheerful voice . Jason ordered fresh coffee . " Guess we 're lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunlight . " Do n't be so sure . The weather around here can change mighty quickly . " While Carol breakfasted , Jason had another cup of coffee . " Hope I did n't talk your ear off last night , " Carol said . " Do n't be silly . I 'm sorry I fell asleep . " " What . about you , doctor ? " Carol asked , putting jam on a croissant . " You have n't told me much about yourself . " She did n't mentionthat Hayes had told her a good deal about him . " Not much to tell . " Carol raised her eyebrows . When she saw his smile , she laughed . " For a second I thought you were serious . " Jason told Carol about his boyhood in Los Angeles , his education at Berkeley and Harvard Medical School , and his residency at MassachusettsGeneral . Without meaning to , he found himself describing Danielle and the awful November night when she 'd been killed . No one had ever drawn him out the way Carol did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Danielle 's death . Jason even heard himselfdescribing his current depression over his increased patient mortalityand then Roger 's news that morning about Marge Todd 's death . " I 'm flattered that you 've told me this , " Carol said sincerely . She had n't expected such openness and trust . " You 've had a lot of emotionalpain . " " Life can be like that , " Jason said with a sigh . " I do n't know why I 've bored you with all this . " " It has n't been boring , " Carol said . " I think you 've made an extraordinaryadjustment . I think it was difficult yet very positive that you changed your work and living environment . " " Do you ? " Jason asked . He had n't remembered saying that . He had n't expected to be so personal with Carol , but now that he 'd done so , he felt better . Enjoying their time together , it was n't until ten-thirty that they emerged from their respective rooms dressed for the day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front entrance , and they took the elevator down to the lobby . True to Carol 's prediction ,  |p163when  they emerged from the hotel the sky had darkened and a steady rain was falling . With the help of an Avis map and Carol 's memory , they drove out to the University of Washington 's Medical School . Carol pointed out the research building Hayes had visited . They went in the front entranceand were immediately challenged by a uniformed security man . They had no University of Washington identity badges . " I 'm a doctor from Boston , " Jason said , removing his wallet to show his ID . " Hey , man , I do n't care where you 're from . No badge , no entry . Simple as that . If you want to come in here , you have to go to Central Administration . " Seeing it was fruitless to argue , they went to Central Administration . En route , Jason asked how Hayes had handled security . " He called his friend beforehand , " Carol said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The woman at Central Administration was friendly and accommodating , and even showed Carol a faculty book to see if she could pick out Hayes 's friend . But faces were n't enough , and Carol could n't identify him . Instead , armed with security badges , they returned to the research building . Carol led Jason up to the fifth floor . The corridor was crowded with spare equipment , and the walls were in need of fresh paint . There was a pungent chemical smell , akin to formaldehyde . " Here 's the lab , " Carol said , stopping by an open doorway . The names to the left of the door were Duncan Sechler , MD , PhD ; and Rhett Shannon , MD , PhD . The department was , as Jason might have guessed , molecular genetics . " Which name ? " Jason asked . " I do n't know , " Carol said , going up to a young technician and asking if either of the doctors was in . " Both . They 're in the animal room . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by so he could catch the view from the rear . Jason was surprised by his blatancy . The door to the animal room had a large glass panel . Inside were two men in white coats drawing blood from a monkey . " It was the tall one with the gray hair , " Carol said , pointing . Jason moved closer to the window . The man Carol indicated was handsome and athletic appearing , of approximately Jason 's age . His hairp164was a uniform silver color that gave him a particularly distinguished look . The other man , in contrast , was almost bald . What hair he had was combed over the top of his head in a vain attempt to cover the thinning spot . " Will he remember you ? " " Possibly . We only met for a moment before I went off to the Psychology Department . " They waited until the doctors finished their task and emerged from the animal room . The tall gray-haired man was carrying the vial of blood . " Excuse me , " Jason said . " Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man glanced at Jason 's badge . " Are you a drug rep ? " " Heavens , no . " Jason smiled . " I 'm Dr. Jason Howard and this is Miss Carol Donner . " " What can I do for you ? " " I 'll see you in a minute , Duncan , " interrupted the balding man . " Okay , " Duncan said . " I 'll run the blood immediately . " Then , turning to Jason , he said , " Sorry . " " Quite all right . I wanted to talk to you about an old acquain-tance . " " Oh ? " " Alvin Hayes . Do you remember him visiting you here ? " " Sure , " Duncan said , turning to Carol . " And were n't you with him ? " Carol nodded . " You have a good memory . " " I was shocked to hear he 'd died . What a loss . " " Carol said Hayes came to ask you something important , " Jason said . " Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked upset , glancing nervously around at the technicians . " I 'm not sure I want to talk about it . " " I 'm sorry to hear that . Was it business or a personal matter ? " " Maybe you 'd better come into my office . " Jason had trouble containing his excitement . It finally sounded as if he 'd stumbled onto something significant . After entering the office , Duncan closed the door . There were two metal-backed chairs . Removing stacks of journals , he motioned for Jason and Carol to sit.  | " To answer your question , " he said , " Hayes came to see me for personal reasons , not business . " " We 've come three thousand miles just to talk with you , " Jason said . He was n't going to give up so easily , but it was n't sounding encouraging . " If you 'd called , I could have saved you the trip . " Some of Duncan'sfriendliness had disappeared from his voice . " Maybe I should tell you why we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery of Hayes 's possible discovery and his own futile attempts to figure out what it might have been . " You think Hayes came to me for help in his research ? " Duncan asked . " That 's what I 'd hoped . " Duncan gave a short , unpleasant laugh . He looked at Jason out of the corner of his eye . " You would n't be a narc , would you ? " Jason was confused . " All right , I 'll tell you what Hayes wanted . A place to buy marjuana . He said he was terrified to fly with the stuff and could n't bringany with him . As a favor , I set him up with a kid on campus . " Jason was stunned . His excitement dwindled like air seeping out ofa balloon , leaving him deflated . " I 'm sorry to have taken your time .... " " Not at all . " Carol and Jason walked out of the research building , surrenderingtheir visitor 's badges to the security guard . Carol was smiling slyly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jason said as they got into the car . " But it is , " Carol said . " You just ca n't see it right at this moment . " " We might as well go home , " he said gloomily . " Oh , no ! You dragged me all the way out here , and we 're not leaving until you see the mountains . It 's only a short drive . " " Let me think about it , " Jason told her moodily . Carol prevailed . They went back to the hotel , got their belongings , and before Jason knew it , they were on a freeway heading out of town . She insisted on driving . Soon the suburbs gave way to misty green forest , and the rolling hills became mountains . The rain stopped and Jason could see snow-capped peaks in the distance . The scenery was so beautiful he forgot his disappointment . " It gets even prettier , " Carol said as they left the freeway , headingp166toward Cedar Falls . She remembered the route now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , Carol drove along the Cedar River . It was a nature fairyland , with deep forests , craggy rocks , distant mountains , and rushing rivers . As dusk fell , Carol turned off the road and bumped across a crushed stone driveway , coming to a halt in front of a picturesque mountain lodge constructed like an enormousfive-story log cabin . Smoke curled up lazily from a huge fieldstonechimney . A sign over the steps leading to the porch saidSALMON INN . " Is this where you and Alvin stayed ? " Jason asked , peering through the windshield . There was a huge porch with raw pine furniture . " This is it . " Carol reached around to get her bag from the back seat . They got out of the car . There was a chill to the air and the pungent smell of woodsmoke . Jason heard a distant sound of rushing water . " The river 's on the other side of the lodge , " Carol said , mounting the steps . " Just a little way up there 's a cute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed her , suddenly wondering what the hell he was doing . The trip had been a mistake ; he belonged back in Boston with his critically ill patients . Yet here he was in the Cascade Mountains with a girl he had no business admiring . The interior of the inn was every bit as charming as the exterior . The central room was a large , two-story affair dominated by a gargantuanfireplace . It was furnished with chintz , animal heads , and scattered bearskin rugs . There were several people reading in front of the fire and a family playing Scrabble . A few heads turned as Jason and Carol approached the registration desk . " Do you people have a reservation ? " asked the man behind the desk . Jason wondered if the man was joking . The place was immense , it was in the middle of nowhere , it was early November , and it was n't a weekend . He could n't imagine the demand would be very high . " No reservations , " Carol said . " Is that a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , bending over his book.  | " How many rooms are there in the hotel ? " Jason asked , still bemused . " Forty-two and six suites , " the receptionist said without looking up . " Is there a shoe convention in town ? " The man laughed . " It 's always full this time of year . The salmon are running . " Jason had heard of the Pacific salmon and how they 'd mysteriouslyreturn to the particular freshwater breeding grounds that had spawned them . But he 'd thought the phenomenon occurred in the spring . " You 're in luck , " the receptionist said . " We have a room , but you might have to move tomorrow night . How many nights are you planning to stay ? " Carol looked at Jason . Jason felt a rush of anxiety  --  only one room ! He did n't know what to say . He started to stammer . " Three nights , " Carol said . " Fine . And how will you settle your bill ? " There was a pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his wallet . He could n't believe what was happening . As they followed the bellboy down the second-floor hallway , Jason wondered how he 'd gotten himself into this . He hoped there would at least be twin beds . Much as he admired Carol 's looks , he was n't prepared for an affair with an exotic dancer who did God knows what else on the side . " You people have a wonderful view , " the bellboy said . Jason went in , but his eyes shifted immediately to the sleeping arrangements , not the windows . He was relieved to see separate beds . When the boy left , Jason finally went over to admire the dramatic vista . The Cedar River , which at that point widened to what appeared to be a small lake , was bordered by tall evergreens that glowed a dark purple in the fading light . Immediately below was a lawn that sloped down to the water 's edge . Extending out into the river was a maze of docks used to moor twenty to thirty rowboats . On racks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large rubber boats with outboard motors were tied to the end of a dock . Jason could tell there was a significant current in the river despite its placid appear/ance , since all four of the rubber boats had their sterns pointed downriver , their bowlines taut . " Well , what do you think ? " Carol said , clapping her hands . " Is n't it cozy ? " The room was papered with a flower print . The floor was broadplankedpine with scattered rag rugs . The beds were covered with comforters printed to appear like quilts . " It 's wonderful , " Jason said . He glanced into the bathroom , hoping for robes . " You seem to be the tour director . What now ? " " I vote for dinner immediately . I 'm starved . And I think the diningroom only serves until seven . People turn in early here . " The restaurant had a curved , windowed wall facing the river . In the center of the wall were double doors leading to a wide porch . Jason guessed that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were steps from the porch down to the lawn , and at the docks the lights had come on , illuminating the water . About half of the two dozen tables in the room were filled . Most of the people were already on their coffee . It seemed to Jason that everyone stopped talking the moment he and Carol appeared . " Why do I feel we 're on display ? " Jason whispered . " Because you 're anxious about sleeping in the same room with a young woman whom you barely know , " Carol whispered . " I think you feel defensive and a little guilty and unsure of what 's expected of you . " Jason 's lower jaw slowly sank . He tried to look into Carol 's warmly liquid eyes to comprehend what was in there . He knew he was blushing . How on earth could a girl who danced half nude be so perceptive ? Jason had always prided himself on his ability to evaluate people : after all , it was his job . As a physician , he had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet why did he feel there was something about Carol that did n't fit ? Glancing at Jason 's red face , Carol laughed . " Why do n't you just relax and enjoy yourself . Let down your hair , doctor I 'm certainly not going to bite . " " Okay , " Jason said . " I 'll do just that . " They dined on salmon , which was offered in bewilderingly temptingvarieties . After great deliberation , they both had it baked in a pastry shell . For authenticity , they sampled a Washington State chardonnaywhich Jason found surprisingly good . At one point he heardp169himself laughing aloud . It had been a long time since he 'd felt so free . It was at that point they both realized they were alone in the dining room . Later that night when Jason was in bed , looking up at the dark ceiling , he again felt confused . It had been a comedy of sorts getting to bed , juggling towels as coverups , flipping a coin to see who used the bathroom first , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . Jason had never remembered feeling quite so body conscious . Jason rolled over . In the darkness , he could just make out the outline of Carol 's form . She was on her side . He could hear the faint sound of her rhythmical breathing against the background sound of the distantwaterfall . She was obviously asleep . Jason envied her honest acceptance of herself and her untroubled slumber . But what confusedJason was not the inconsistencies of Carol 's personality , but rather the fact that he was enjoying himself . And it was Carol who was making it happen.  |p170Weatherwise  , their luck held . When they opened the drapes in the morning , the river sparkled with the brilliance of a million gemstones . The minute they finished breakfast , Carol announced they were going on a hike . With box lunches from the hotel , they walked up the Cedar River on a well-marked trail alive with birds and small animals . About a quarter of a mile from the lodge they came upon the waterfall Carol had mentioned . It was a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They joined several other tourists on a wooden viewing platform and watched in awed silence as the wild water cascaded downward . Just below them , a magnificent rainbow-colored fish , three to four feet long , broke the turbulent surface of the water , and in defianceof gravity leaped up the face of the first ledge . Within seconds it had leaped again , clearing the second ledge by a wide margin . " My God , " Jason exclaimed . He 'd remembered reading that salmon were capable of running through rapids against the current , but he had no idea that they could navigate such high falls . Jason and Carol stayed mesmerized as several other salmon leaped . He could only marvel at the physical stamina the fish were displaying . The genetically determined urge to procreate was a powerful force . " It 's unbelievable , " he said as a particularly large fish began to swim the watery gauntlet . " Alvin was fascinated too , " Carol said . Jason could well imagine , especially with Hayes 's interest in developmentaland growth hormones . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " There 's more . " They continued up the trail , which left the river 's edge for a quarterof a mile , taking them deep into a forest . When the trail returned to the river , the Cedar had widened into another small lake like thep171one in front of the Salmon Inn . It was about a quarter of a mile across and a mile long , and its surface was dotted with fishermen . A cabin much like a miniature Salmon Inn lay nestled in a stand of large pines . In front of it at the water 's edge was a short dock with half a dozen rowboats . Carol took Jason up the flagstone walk and through the front door . The cabin was a fishing concession run by the Salmon Inn . There was a long , glass-fronted counter to the right , presided over by a bearded man in a red-checkered wool shirt , red suspenders , faded trousers , and caulked boots . Jason guessed he was in his late sixties , and that he would have made a perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him was an enormous selectionof fishing poles . Carol introduced Jason to the older man , whose name was Stooky Griffiths , saying that Alvin had enjoyed visiting with Stooky while she fished . " Hey , " Carol said suddenly . " How about trying your hand at some salmon fishing ? " " Not for me , " Jason said . Hunting and fishing had never interested him . " I think I 'll try . Come on  --  be a sport . " " You go ahead , " Jason urged . " I can entertain myself . " " Okay . " She turned to Stooky and made arrangements for a pole and some bait , then tried once more to talk Jason into joining her , but he shook his head . " Is this where you and Alvin fished ? " he asked , looking out the window at the river . " Nope , " Carol said , collecting her gear . " Alvin was like you . He would n't join me . But I caught a big one . Right off the dock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jason asked , surprised . " No , " said Carol . " He just watched the fish . " " I thought Alvin told Sebastion Frahn he wanted to go fishing . " " What can I say ? Once we got here , Alvin was content to wander around and observe . You know , the scientist . " Jason shook his head in confusion . " I 'll be on the dock , " Carol said brightly . " If you change your mind , come on down . It 's fun ! " Jason watched her run down the flagstone walk , wondering why Alvin would have made such elaborate inquiries about fishing and then never cast a line . It was weird.  |p172Two  men came into the cabin and made arrangements with Stooky for gear , bait , and a boat . Jason stepped outside onto the porch . There were several rocking chairs . Stooky had hung a bird feeder from the eaves and dozens of birds circled it . Jason watched for a while , then wandered down to join Carol . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves on the bottom . Suddenly , a huge salmon flashed out of the dark emerald green of the deeper water and shot under the dock , heading for a shallow , shady area fifty feet away . Looking after it , Jason noticed a disturbance on the surface of the water . Curious , he walked over along the shore . When he got close , he saw another large salmon lying on its side in a few feet of water , its tail flapping weakly . Jason tried pushing it with a stick into deeper water , but it did n't help . The fish was obviously ill . A few feet away he spotted another salmon lying immobile in just a few inches of water , and , still closer to shore , a dead fish being eaten by a large bird . Jason walked back up the flagstone path . Stooky had come out of the cabin and was sitting in one of the rockers with a pipe stuck between his teeth . Leaning on the rail , Jason asked him about the sick fish , wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nope , " Stooky said . He took several puffs on his well-chewed pipe . " No pollution here . Them fish just spawned and now it 's time for ' em to die . " " Oh , yeah , " Jason said , suddenly remembering what he 'd read about the salmon 's life cycle . The fish pushed themselves to their limits to return to their spawning grounds , but once they laid their eggs and fertilized them , they died . No one knew exactly why . There yliad'been theories about the physiological problems of going from saltwater to freshwater , but no one knew for certain . It was one of nature 's mysteries . Jason looked down at Carol . She was busy trying to cast her line out from the dock . Turning back to Stooky , he asked , " Do you by any chance remember talking with a doctor by the name of Alvin Hayes ? " " Nope . " " He was about my height , " Jason continued . " Had long hair . Pale skin . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bet you do , " Jason said . " But the man I 'm talking about was with that girl . " He pointed toward Carol . Jason guessed Stooky did n't see too many girls who looked like Carol Donner . " The one on the dock ? " " That 's right . She 's a looker . " Smoke came out of Stooky 's mouth in short puffs . His eyes narrowed . " Could the fella you 're talking about come from Boston ? " Jason nodded . " I remember him , " Stooky said . " But he did n't look like no doc-tor . " " He did research . " " Maybe that explains it . He ealitrange . Paid me a hundredbucks to get him twenty-five salmon heads . " .. , 47iusf ifie Tieads ' '  --  " Yup . Gave me his telephone number back in Boston . Told me to call collect when I had ' em . " " Then he came back here to get them ? " Jason asked , remembering Hayes and Carol had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean ' em good and pack ' em in ice . " " Why did it take so long ? " Jason asked . With all the fish available , it seemed twenty-five heads could have been collected in a single afternoon . He only ya.pted certain Amon , " Stooky said3 " Thev had , tohaie jusxsnawned  --  and spawning salmon do n't take bait . You have to net ' em . Them people fishing out there are catching trout . " " A particular species of salmon ? " " Nope . They 'd just had to have spawned . " " Did he say why he wanted those heads ? " " He did n't and I did n't ask , " Stooky said . " He was payin ' and I figured it was his business . " " And just fishheads  --  nothing else . " " Just fishheads . " Jason left the porch frustrated and mystified . The idea that Hayes had come three thousand miles for fishheads and marijuana seemed preposterous . Carol spotted him at the edge of the dock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try this , Jason , " she said . " I almost caught a salmon . " " The salmon do n't bite here , " Jason said . " It must have been a trout . " Carol looked disappointed . Jason studied her lovely , high-cheekboned face . If his original premise was correct , the , salmon heads , had o have been associated with Hayes 's attempts to create a monoclonal antibody . But how could that help Carol 's beauty as Hayes had told her ? It did n't make any sense . " I guess it does n't matter whether it 's trout or salmon , " Carol said , turning her attention back to her fishing . " I 'm having fun . " A circling hawk plunged down into the shallow water and tried to grasp one of the dying salmon with its talons , but the fish was too big and the bird let go and soared back into the sky . As Jason watched , the salmon stopped struggling in the water and died . " I got one ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement of the catch cleared Jason 's mind . He helped Carol land a good-sized trout  --  a beautiful fish with steely black eyes . Jason felt sorry for it . After he 'd gotten the hook out of its lower lip , he talked Carol into throwing it back into the water . It was gone in a flash . For lunch they walked along the banks of the widened river to a rocky promontory . As they ate , they could not only see the entire expanse of the river , but the snow-capped peaks of the Cascade Mountains . It was breathtaking . It was late afternoon when they started back to the Salmon Inn . As they passed the cabin they saw another large fish in its death throes . It was on its side , its glistening white belly visible . " How sad , " Carol said , gripping Jason 's arm . " Why do they have to die ? " Jason did n't have any answers . The old cliche , " It 's nature 's way , " occurred to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments they watched the once magnificent salmon as several smaller fish darted over to feed on its living flesh . " Ugh ! " Carol said , giving Jason 's arm a tug . They continued walking . To change the subject , Carol started talking about another diversionthe hotel had to offer . It was white-water rafting . But Jason did n't hear . The horrid ' mageof the tiny predators feed from thep175flying larger fish had started the germ of an idea in Jason 's mind . Suddenly , like a revelation , he had a sense of what Hayes had discovered . It was n't ironic  --  it was terrifying . The color drained from Jason 's face and he stopped walking . " What 's the matter ? " Carol asked . Jason swallowed . His eyes stared , unblinking . " Jason , what is it ? " " We have to get back to Boston , " he said with urgency in his voice . He set off again at a fast pace , almost dragging Carol with him . " What are you talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jason ! What 's going on ? " She jerked him to a stop . " I 'm sorry , " he said , as if waking from a trance . " I suddenly have an idea of what Alvin may have stumbled onto . We have to get back . " " What do you mean  --  tonight ? " " Right away . " " Now wait just a minute . There wo n't be any flights to Boston tonight . It 's three hours later there . We can stay over and leave early in the morning if you insist . " Jason did n't reply . " At least we can have dinner , " Carol added irritably . Jason allowed her to calm him down . After all , who knows ? I could be wrong , he thought . Carol wanted to discuss it , but Jason told her she would n't understand . " That 's pretty patronizing . " " I 'm sorry . I 'll tell you all about it when I know for sure . " By the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . If they 'd driven to Seattle , they 'd have gotten to the airportaround midnight Boston time . There would n't have been any flights until morning . Descending to the dining room , they were escorted to a table directly in front of the doors leading to the veranda . Jason sat Carol facing the doors , saying she deserved the view . After they 'd been given their menu , he apologized for acting so upset and gave her full credit for being right about not leaving immediately . " I 'm impressed you 're willing to admit it , " Carol said . For variety , they ordered trout instead of salmon , and in place ofp176the Washington state wine , they had a Napa Valley chardonnay* Outside , the evening slowly darkened into night and the lights went on at the docks . Jason had trouble concentrating on the meal . He was beginning to realize that if his theory was correct , Hayes had been murdered and Helene had not been the victim of random violence . And if Hayes was right and someone was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be far worse than any epidemic . While Jason 's mind was churning , Carol was carrying on a conversation , but when she realized he was off someplace , she reached across and gripped his arm . " You are not eating , " she said . Jason looked absently at her hand on his arm , his plate , and then Carol . " I 'm preoccupied , I 'm sorry . " " It does n't matter . If you 're not hungry , maybe we should go and find out about flights to Boston in the morning . " " We can wait until you 're through eating , " Jason said . Carol tossed her napkin on the table . " I 've had more than enough , thank you . " Jason looked for their waiter . His eyes roamed the room and then stopped . They became riveted on a man who had just entered the dining room and paused by the maitre d 's lectern . The man was slowly scanning the room , his eyes moving from table to table . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt open at the collar . Even from the distance , Jason could tell the man wore a heavy gold necklace . He could see the sparkle from the overhead lights . Jason studied the man . He looked familiar , but Jason could n't place him . He was Hispanic , with dark hair and deeply tanned skin . He looked like a successful businessman . Suddenly , Jason remembered . He 'd seen the face on that awful night when Hayes had died . The man had been outside the restaurant and then outside the MassachusettsGeneral Hospital emergency room . Just then the man spotted Jason , and Jason felt a sudden chill descend his spine . It was apparent the man recognized Jason because he immediately started forward , his right hand casually thrust into his jacket pocket . He walked deliberately , closing the distance quickly . Having just thought of Helen Brennquivist 's murder , Jason panicked . His intuition told him what was coming , but he could n't move . All he could do was look at Carol . He wanted to scream andp177tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was paralyzed . Out of the corner of his eye , he saw the man round the nearby table . " Jason ? " questioned Carol , tilting her head to one side . The man was only steps away . Jason saw his hand come out of his pocket and the glint of metal as his hand covered the gun . The sight of the weapon finally galvanized Jason into action . In a sudden explosion of activity , he snatched the tablecloth from the table , sending the dishes , glasses , and silverware flying to the floor . Carol leaped to her feet with a scream . Jason rushed the man , flinging the tablecloth over his head , pushinghim backward into a neighboring table and knocking it over in a shower of china and glass . The people at the table screamed and tried to get away , but several were caught in the tangle of overturned chairs . In the commotion , Jason grabbed Carol 's hand and yanked her through the doors to the porch . Having managed to break s panicfilledparalysis , Jason was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businessman had been : the killer Hayes claliried was on his trail . Jason had n4doub1 " " his ' nextiargets-were Carol and himself . ' -  - -  He pulled Carol down the front steps , intending to run around the hotel to the parking lot . But then he realized they 'd never make it . They had a better chance running for one of the boats at the dock . " Jason ! " Carol yelled as he changed direction and dragged her down the lawn . " What 's wrong with you ? " Behind them , Jason could hear the doors to the dining room crash open , and assumed they were being chased . When they reached the dock , Carol tried to stop . " Come on , dammit , " Jason shouted through gritted teeth . Looking back at the inn , he could see a figure run to the porch railing , then start down the stairs . Carol tried to jerk her hand free , but Jason tightened his clasp and yanked her forward . " He wants to kill us ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the dock , ignoring the rowboats . Jason shouted to Carol to help untie three of the rubber boats and push them off . They were already drifting downstream by the time their pursuer hit the dock . Jason helped Carol into the fourth boat and scrambled after her , pushing them away from the dock with his foot . They too drifted downstream , slowly at first , then gatheringp178speed . Jason forced Carol to lie down , then covered her body with his own . An innocent-sounding pop was immediately followed by a dull thud somewhere in the boat . Almost simultaneously there was the sound of escaping air . Jason groaned . The man was shooting at them with a silenced pistol . Another pop was followed by a ringing sound as a bullet ricocheted off the outboard motor , and another made a slapping sound in the water . To Jason 's relief , he realized the rubber boat was compartmentalized . Although a bullet had deflated one section , the boat would n't sink . A few more shots fell short , then Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted his head cautiously and looked back . The man had pulled one of the canoes from the rack and was pushingit into the water . Jason was again gripped with fear  --  the man could paddle much faster than they were drifting . Their only chance was to start the motor  --  an old-fashioned outboard with a pull cord . Jason shifted the gear lever to " start " and tugged the cord . The engine did n't even turn over . The killer had already boarded the canoe and was starting toward them . Jason pulled the cord again : nothing . Carol lifted her head and said nervously , " He 's getting closer . " For the next fifteen seconds , Jason frantically jerked the starter cord over and over . He could see the silhouette of the oncoming canoe moving silently through the water . He checked to make sure the lever was at " start , " then tried again without success . His eyes drifted to the gas tank , which he prayed was full . Its black cap appeared to be loose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a button he guessed was to increase pressure in the tank . He pushed it a half dozen times , noticing that it became increasingly harder to depress . Looking up again , he saw the canoe was almost to them . Grasping the starter cord again , Jason pulled with all his . strength . The motor roared to life . Then he reached for the lever and pushed it to " reverse , " as they were floating downstream backward . He jammed the throttle forward and threw himself back onto the bottom of the boat , pinning Carol beneath him . As expected , there were several more shots , two of which hit the rubber boat . When Jason dared to look out again , the gap had widened . In the darkness , he could barely see the canoe . " Stay down , " he commanded to Carol , while he checked the ex/tent of the damage . A section of the right side of the bow was soft , as was a portion of the left gunwale . Otherwise the boat was intact . Moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the motor into " forward , " then angled the tiller to head downstream , steering out to the center of the river . The last thing he wanted to do was hit rocks . " Okay , " he called to Carol . " It 's safe to sit up . " Carol rose gingerly from the bottom of the boat and ran her fingersthrough her hair . " I really do n't believe this , " she shouted over the noise of the outboard . " Just what the hell are we going to do ? " " We 'll head downriver until we see some lights . There 's got to be plenty of places along here . " As they motored along , Jason wondered if it would be safe to stop at another dock . After all , their pursuer might get into his car and drive along the river . Maybe there 's a light on the opposite side , he thought . From the silhouettes of the trees lining the lake-like expanse of the river , Jason could gauge their speed . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the feeling the river was again gradually narrowing , especially when it appeared that their speed was increasing . Aftera half hour , there were still no lights . Just a dark forest bordering a star-strewn , moonless sky . " I do n't see a thing , " yelled Carol . " It 's okay , " reassured Jason . After traveling another quarter hour , the bordering trees closed in rather suddenly , suggesting the lakelike expanse was coming to an end . When the trees were closer , Jason realized he had misjudged their speed ; they were moving much faster than he 'd thought . Reachingback he cut the throttle . The small outboard whined down . As soon as the sound of the outboard fell , Jason heard another more ominous noise . It was the deep growling roar of white water . " Oh , God , " he said to himself , remembering the falls upriver from the Salmon Inn . He pushed the small outboard to the side and turned the boat around . Then he gave it full throttle . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not stop their rush downriver . Next he tried to angle the boat toward shore . Slowly , it moved laterally . But then all hell broke loose . The river narrowed to a rocky gorge , and Jason and Carol were unwittingly sucked into it . Around the top edge of the rubber boat was a short rope securedp180at intervals by eyelets . Jason grabbed a hold on either side , spanning the craft with his outstretched arms . He yelled for Carol to do the same . She could n't hear over the roar of the water , but when she saw what he was doing , she attempted to do the same . Unfortunately , she could n't quite reach . She held on to one side and hooked a leg under one of the wooden seats . At that moment , they hit the first real turbulence , and the boat was tossed into the air like a cork . Water came into the boat in a blinding , drenching sheet . Jason sputtered . The darkness and water in his eyes made it all but impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against his and he tried to anchor her with his leg . Then they thudded into a rock and the boat spun counter-clockwise . Through all this violent activity , Jason kept seeingthe image of the falls , knowing that at any second they could plummet to their death . Jason and Carol clutched at the ropes in utter terror . They bounced from side to side and end to end , in rapid gyrations , completelyat the mercy of the water . At every moment he thought they were going over . Water filled the cockpit . It was stingingly cold . After what seemed like an eternity of hell , the water smoothed out . They were still spinning and careening downriver , but without the sudden violent upheavals . Jason glanced out . He could make out the sheer falls of rock on either side . He knew it was n't over . With a tremendous upward surge , the violent dubbing recommenced . Jason could feel his fingers begin to pain him ; a combination of constant muscular contraction and the cold was having its effect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to tighten his hold on Carol with his legs . The pain in his hands was so intense that for an instant he thought he 'd have to let go . Then , as suddenly as the nightmare began , it was over . Still spinning , the boat shot out onto relatively placid water . The thundering noise of the rapids lessened . The sides of the river fell away , opening up a clear view to the starry sky . Inside the boat there was a half foot of icy water , but Jason realized the outboard was chugging as smoothly as if nothing had happened . With shaking hands , Jason straightened the boat and stopped its nauseating rotation . His fingers touched a button just inside the transom . He took a chance and pressed it ; the water in the boat slowly receded . Jason kept his eye on the silhouettes of the bordering trees . Ahead ,  |p181the  river bent sharply to the left , and as they rounded the point , they finally saw lights . Jason steered to shore . As they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a number of rubber boats like their own . He was still afraid the killer might have driven down to intercept them , but he knew they had to land . Jason pulled alongside the second dock and cut the engine . " You sure know how to entertain a girl , " Carol said through chatteringteeth . " I 'm glad you still have your sense of humor , " Jason said . " Do n't count on it lasting much longer . I want to know what in heaven 's name is going on . " Jason stood up stiffly , holding on to the dock . He helped Carol out of the boat , got out himself , and tied the line to a cleat . The sound of country music drifted from one of the buildings . " It must be a bar , " said Jason . He took her hand . " We have to get warm before we get pneumonia . " Jason led the way up the gravel path , but instead of going inside , he walked into the parking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hold on , " said Carol with irritation . " What are you doing now ? " " I 'm looking for keys , " Jason said . " We need a car . " " I do n't believe this , " said Carol , throwing up her hands . " I thought we were going to get warm . I do n't know about you , but I 'm going in that restaurant . " Without waiting for a response , she started for the entrance . Jason caught up to her and grabbed her arm . " I 'm afraid he 'll be back  --  the man who was shooting at us . " " Then we 'll call the police , " Carol said . She pulled out of Jason 's grasp and entered the restaurant . The Hispanic was not in the restaurant , so , following Carol 's suggestion , they called the police , who happened to be a local sheriff . The proprietor of the restaurant refused to believe that Jason and Carol had navigated Devil 's Chute in the dark  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He found chef 's smocks and oversized black and white checkered kitchen pants for them to change into , and a plastic garbage bag for their wet clothes . He also insisted they have steaming hot rum toddies , which finally stopped their shivering . " Jason , you 've got to tell me what 's going on , " Carol insisted asp182they waited for the sheriff . They sat at a table across from a Wurlitzerjukebox playing fifties music . " I do n't know for sure , " Jason said . " But the man shooting at us was outside the restaurant where Alvin died . My guess is that Alvin was a victim of his own discovery , but if he had n't died that night , the same man would have eventually killed him anyway . So Alvin was telling the truth when he said someone wanted him dead . " " This does n't sound real , " Carol said , trying to smooth her hair , which was drying in tangled ringlets . " I know . Most conspiracies do n't . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know for sure , but if my theory is right , it 's almost too scary to contemplate . That 's why I want to get back to Boston . " Just then the door opened and the sheriff , Marvin Arnold , walked in . He was a mountain of a man dressed in a wrinkled brown uniformthat sported more buckles and straps than Jason had ever seen . More important to Jason was the .357 Magnum strapped to Marvin 's oversized left thigh . That was the kind of cannon Jason wished he 'd had back at the Salmon Inn . Marvin had already heard about the commotion at the Salmon Inn , and had been there to check things out . What he had n't heard about was any man with a gun , and no one had heard any gunshots . When Jason described what had happened , he could tell that Marvin regarded him with a good deal of skepticism . Marvin was surprised and impressed , however , when he heard that Jason and Carol had come down Devil 's Chute by themselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to believe that , " he said , shaking his massive head in admiration . Marvin drove Jason and Carol back to the Salmon Inn , where Jason was surprised to find out there was a question of charges being filed against him , holding him responsible for the damages in the dining room . No one had seen any gun . And even more shocking , no one remembered an olive-complexioned man in a dark blue suit . But in the end , the management decided to drop the issue , saying they 'd let their insurance take care of the damages . With that decided , Marvintipped his hat , preparing to leave . " What about protection ? " asked Jason . " From what ? " asked Marvin . " Do n't you think it is a little embarrassingthat no one can corroborate your story ? Listen , I think youp183people have caused enough trouble tonight . I think you should go up to your room and sleep this whole thing off . " " We need protection , " said Jason . He tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killer returns ? " " Look , friend , I ca n't sit here all night and hold your hand . I 'm the only one on this shift and I got the whole damned county to keep my eye on . Lock yourself in your room and get some shut-eye . " With a final nod toward the manager , Marvin lumbered out the front door . The manager in turn smiled condescendingly at Jason and went into his office . " This is unreal , " Jason said with a mixture of fear and irritation . " I ca n't believe nobody noticed the Hispanic guy . " He went to the public phone booth and looked up private detective agencies . He found several in Seattle , but when he dialed he just got their answeringmachines . He left his name and the hotel number , but he did n't have much hope of reaching someone that night . Emerging from the phone booth , he told Carol that they were leaving immediately . She followed him up the stairs . " It 's nine-thirty at night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't care . We 're leaving as fast as we can . Get your things together . " " Do n't I have any say in the matter ? " " Nope . It was your decision to stay tonight and your decision to call the helpful local police . Now it 's my turn . We 're leaving . " For a minute , Carol stood in the center of the room watching Jason pack , then she decided he probably had a point . Ten minutes later , changed into their own clothes , they carried their luggage downstairs and checked out . " I have to charge you for tonight , " the man at the desk informed them . Jason did n't bother to argue . Instead , he asked the man if he 'd bring their car around to the front entrance . He tipped him five dollars and the clerk was happy to oblige . Once in the car , Jason had hoped he 'd feel less anxious and less vulnerable . Neither was the case . As he pulled out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he quickly recognizedhow isolated they were . Fifteen minutes later , in the rearviewp184mirror , he saw headlights appear . At first Jason tried to ignore them , but then it became apparent that they were relentlessly gaining on them despite Jason 's gradual acceleration . The terror Jason had felt earlier crept back . His palms began to perspire . " There 's someone behind us , " Jason said . Carol twisted in the front seat and looked out the back . They rounded a curve and the headlights disappeared . But on the next straightaway they reappeared . They were closer . Carol faced forward . " I told you we should have stayed . " " That 's helpful ! " said Jason sarcastically . He inched the accelerator closer to the floor . They were already going well over sixty on the curvy road . He tightened his grip on the steering wheel , then looked up at the rearview mirror . The car was close , its lights like eyes of a monster . He tried to think of what he could do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outrun the car behind them . They came to another curve . Jason turned the wheel . He saw Carol 's mouth open in a silent scream . He could feel the car start to jackknife . He braked , and they skidded first to one side and then to the other . Carol grabbed the dash to steady herself . Jason felt his seat belt tighten . Fighting the car , Jason managed to keep it on the road . Behind him the pursuing car gained considerably . Now it was directly behind , its headlights filling Jason 's car with unearthly light . In a panic , Jason floored the accelerator , pulling his car out of its careeningcourse . They shot forward down a small hill . But the car behind stayed right with them , hounding them like a hunting dog at the heels of a deer . Then to both Jason and Carol 's bewilderment , their car filled with flashing red light . It took them a moment to realize that the light was coming from the top of the car behind them . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rearview mirror . The car behind slowed proportionately . Ahead , at a turnout , Jason pulled off the road and stopped . Sweat stood out in little droplets along his hairline . His arms were trembling from his death grip on the steering wheel . Behind them , the other car stopped as well , its flashing light illuminating the surrounding trees . In the rearview mirror , Jason saw the door open , and Marvin Arnold stepped out . He had the safety strap off his .357 Magnum.  | " Well , I 'll be a pig 's ass , " he said , shining his flashlight into Jason'sembarrassed face . " It 's lover boy . " Furious , Jason shouted , " Why the hell did n't you turn on your blinker at the start ? " " Wanted to catch me a speeder . " Marvin chuckled . " Did n't know I was chasing my favorite lunatic . " After an unsolicited lecture and a ticket for reckless driving , he let Jason and Carol continue . Jason was too angry to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Jason announced , " I think we should drive to Portland . God knows who may be waiting for us at the Seattle airport . " " Fine by me , " Carol said , much too tired to argue . They stopped for a couple hours ' sleep at a motel near Portland , and at the first light of dawn , went on to the airport to where they boarded a flight to Chicago . From Chicago , they flew to Boston , touching down a little after five-thirty Saturday evening . In the cab in front of Carol 's apartment , Jason suddenly laughed . " I would n't even know how to apologize for what I 've put you through . " Carol picked up her shoulder bag . " Well , at least it was n't boring . Look , Jason , I do n't mean to be sarcastic , or a nag , but please tell me what 's going on . " " As soon as I 'm sure , " Jason said . " I promise . Really . Just do me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one knows we 're back , but all hell might break loose if and when they find out . " " I do n't plan on going anywhere , doctor . " Carol sighed . " I 've had it . "  |p186Jason  never even stopped at his apartment . As soon as Carol disappeared into her building , he told the cabdriver to drop him at his car and drove directly to GHP . He crossed immediately into the outpatientbuilding . It was seven P.M. and the large waiting room was deserted . Jason went directly to his office , pulled off his jacket , and sat down at his computer terminal . GHP had spent a fortune on their computer system and was proud of it . Each station accessed the large mainframe where all patient data was entered . Although the individual charts were still the best source of patient information , most of the material could be obtained from the computer . Best of all , the sophisticated machinery could scan the entire patient base of GHP and graphically display the data on the screen , analyzed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the current survival curves . The graph that the computer drew was shaped like the steep slope of a mountain , starting high , then rounding and falling off . The graph compared the survival rate of GHP users by age . As one might expect , subscribers at the oldest end of the graph had the lowest survival rate . Over the past five years , although the median age of the GHP population had gradually increased , the survival curves stayed about the same . Next , Jason asked the computer to print month-by-month graphs for the last half year . As he had feared , he saw the death rate rise for patients in their late fifties and early sixties , particularly during the last three months . A sudden crash made him jump from his seat , but when he looked out in the hall he saw it was just the cleaning service . Relieved , Jason returned to the computer . He wished he could separate the data on patients who had been given executive physicals , but he could n't figure out how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crude death rates . These graphs compared the percentages of deaths associated with age . This time the curve went the other way . It started low , then as the age increased the percentage of deaths went up . But then Jason asked the computer to print out a series of such graphs over the previous several months , month by month . The results were striking , particularly over the last two months . The death curves rose sharply starting at age fifty . Jason sat at the computer terminal for another half hour , trying to coax the machine into separating out the executive physicals . What he expected he would see if he 'd been able , was a rapid increase in death rates for people fifty and over who had high-risk factors such as smoking , alcohol abuse , poor diets , and lack of exercise . But the data was not available . It had not been programmed to be extracted en masse . Jason would have to take each individual name and laboriouslyobtain the data himself , but he did n't have time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to corroborate his suspicions . He now knew he was right . But there was one more way to prove it . With enormous unease , he left his office and returned to his car . Driving out the Riverway , Jason headed for Roslindale . The closer he got , the more nervous he became . He had no idea what he was about to confront , but he suspected it was not going to be pleasant . His destination was the Hartford School the institution run by GHP for retarded children . If Alvin Hayes had been right about his own condition , he must have been right about his retarded son 's . The Hartford School backed onto the Arnold Arboretum , an idyllicsetting of graceful wooded hills , fields , and ponds . Jason turned into the parking lot , which was all but deserted , and stopped within fifty feet of the front entrance . The handsome , Colonial-style buildinghad a deceptively serene look that belied the personal family tragedies it housed . Severe retardation was a hard subject even for professionals to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous visits to the school . Physically many were perfectly formed , which only made their low IQs that much more disturbing . The front door was closed and locked , so Jason rang the buzzer and waited . The door was opened by an overweight security guard in a soiled blue uniform . " Can I help you ? " he said , making it clear he had no wish to.  | " I 'm a doctor , " Jason said . He tried to push by the security man , who stepped back to bar his way . " Sorry  --  no visitors after six , doctor . " " I 'm hardly a visitor , " Jason said . He pulled out his wallet and produced his GHP identity card . The guard did n't even look at the ID . " No visitors after six , " he repeated , adding , " and no exceptions . " " But I . . . " Jason began . He stopped in midsentence . From the man 's expression , he knew discussion was futile . " Call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slamming the door . Jason walked back down the front steps and gazed up at the fivestorybuilding . It was brick , with granite window casings . He was n't about to give up . Assuming the guard was watching , Jason went back to his car and drove out the driveway . About a hundred yards down the road , he pulled over to the side . He got out , and with some difficulty made his way through the Arboretum back to the school . He circled the building , staying in the shadows . There were fire escapes on all sides but the front . They went right up to the roof . Unfortunately , as at Carol 's building , none was at ground level , and Jason could n't find anything to stand on to reach the first rung . On the right side of the building , he spotted a flight of stairs that went down to a locked door . Feeling with his hands in the dark , he discovered the door had a central glass pane . He went back up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock the size of a softball . Holding his breath , Jason went back to the door and smashed the glass . In the quiet evening , the clatter seemed loud enough to wake the dead . Jason fled to the nearby trees and hid , watching the building . When no one appeared after fifteen minutes , he ventured out and returned to the door . Gingerly , he reached in and undid the latch . No alarm sounded . For the next half hour Jason stumbled around a large basement he guessed was a storage area . He found a stepladder and debated takingit outside to use to reach a fire escape , but gave up that idea and continued feeling about blindly for a light . His hands finally touched a switch and he flicked it on . He was in a maintenance room filled with lawnmowers , shovels , and other equipment . Next to the light switch was a door . Slowly ,  |p189Jason  eased it open . Beyond was a much larger furnace room that was dimly illuminated . Moving quickly , Jason crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the door at the top and immediately realized he had reached the front hall . From his previous visits he knew the stairs to the wards were to his right . On his left was an office where a middle-aged woman in a bulging white uniform was reading at a desk . Looking down toward the front entrance , Jason could see the guard 's feet perched on a chair . The man 's face was out of sight . As quietly as possible , Jason slipped through the basement door and let it ease back into place . For a moment he was in full view of the woman in the office , but she did n't look up from her book . Forcinghimself to move slowly , he silently crossed the hall and entered the stairwell . He breathed a sigh of relief when he was completely out of sight of both the woman and the guard . Taking the stairs on tiptoe two at a time , he headed for the third floor , where the ward for boys aged four to twelve was located . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quiet , his footsteps echoed in the otherwise silent , cavernous space . Above him was a skylight , which at that time looked like a black onyx set into the ceiling . On the third floor , Jason carefully opened the stairwell door . He remembered there was a glassed-in nurses ' office to the right at the end of a long hallway and noticed that although the corridor was dark , the office still blazed with light . A male attendant was , like the woman downstairs , busy reading . Looking diagonally across the hall , Jason eyed the door to the ward . He noted it had a large central window with embedded wire . After one last check on the attendant , Jason tiptoed across the hall and let himself into the darkened room . Immediately , he was confronted by a musty smell . After waiting a moment to be sure the attendant had n't been disturbed , he began searching for the light . To confirm his suspicions , he would have to turn it on even if it meant being caught . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . The ward was some fifty feet long , with low iron beds lined up on either side , leaving a narrow aisle . There were windows , but they were high , near the ceiling . At the end of the room were tiled toiletp190facilities with a coiled hose for cleaning and a bolted door to the fire escape . Jason walked down the aisle looking at the nameplates attached to the ends of beds : Harrison , Lyons , Gessner . . . . The children , disturbed by the light , began to sit up , staring with wide , vacant , and unknowing eyes at the intruder . Jason stopped , and a terrible sense of revulsion that expanded to terror gripped him . It was worse than he 'd imagined . Slowly , his eyes went from one pitiful face to another of the unwanted creatures . Instead of looking like the children they were , they all looked like miniature senile centenarians with beady eyes , wrinkled dry skin , and thinned white hair , showing scaly patches of scalp . Jason spotted the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aged . He 'd lost most of his eyelashes and his lower lids hung down . In place of his pupils were the glass-white reflection of dense cataracts . Except for light perception , the child was blind . Some of the children began getting out of their beds , balancing precariously on wasted limbs . Then , to Jason 's horror they began to move toward him . One of them began to say feebly the word " please " over and over in a high-pitched , grating voice . Soon the others joined in a terrifying , unearthly chorus . Jason backed up , afraid to be touched . Hayes 's son got out of his bed and began to feel his way forward , his bony , uncoordinated little arms making helpless swirling motions in the air . The mob of children backed Jason up against the ward door and began to tug at his clothes . Frightened and nauseated , Jason pushed open the ward door and retreated into the hall . After he closed the door , the children pressed their mummylike faces against the glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey , you ! " Jason heard a rasping voice behind him . Turning his head , he saw the attendant standing outside his office , waving his open book in astonishment . " What 's goin ' on ? " the man yelled . Jason ran across the hall to the stairwell , but he 'd descended only a few steps before a second voice echoed up from below . " Kevin ? What gives ? " Looking over the railing , Jason saw the guard down on the firstfloorlanding . " Well , I 'll be damned , " the guard said , and charged up the stairs , club in hand.  |p191Reversing  direction , Jason returned to the third floor . The attendantwas still standing in the doorway of his office , apparently too dumbfounded to move as Jason sprinted across the hall and back into the ward . Some of the children were wandering aimlessly about the room ; others had collapsed back on their beds . Jason frantically beckoned them over , opened the door , and as the attendant and guard appeared , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to shove their way through the crowd , but the children clung to them , shouting their eerie , monotonous chorus of please . Reaching the emergency door at the opposite end of the room , Jason depressed its lever which , for safety 's sake , was positioned six feet off the floor . At first the door would n't open . Obviously , it had not been used for years . Jason could see that paint had sealed it shut . Putting his shoulder against it , Jason finally got it to swing free . Stepping out into the dark night , he pushed several of the boys back into the ward before closing the heavy door . Wasting no time , he clambered down the fire escape . There was no need to be quiet now . He was at the second level when the door above him opened . Once again he heard the shrieking of the children . Then he felt the vibration of heavy boots on the fire escape . Pulling out a pin caused the final ladder to descend with a deep thud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . Even before it had touched down , Jason was on it . The slight delay enabled the guard behind Jason to close the distance between them . Once on the lawn , though , Jason 's running ability soon left the beefy guard far behind , and by the time Jason reached his car , he had plenty of time to start the engine , put it in gear , and pull away . In his rearview mirror he could barely see the man just reaching the edge of the road , shaking his fist in the light of a street lamp . Jason could barely control his disgust and fury at what he 'd seen . He drove directly to Boston police headquarters and brazenly left his car in a no-parking zone in front of the building . " I want to see Detective Curran , " Jason told the officer at the desk , then identified himself . The policeman calmly checked his watch , then called up to Homicide . He spoke for a minute , then covered the receiver with his hand . " Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
