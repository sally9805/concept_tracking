' ' Many a farmer would be better off today if he had never had a chance to borrow money at all. ' ' // But in later editions of the textbook , the advice was first abbreviated and then dropped . Talking about the dangers of credit in the boom-time ' 70s did not seem particularly relevant. // Now , American agriculture is relearning the lesson. // Last year , for the first time in 38 years , total farm debt went down . Farmers talk about cash flow . Many , like Bill Landon of Greenwood , Neb. , have grown more cautious. // ' ' There were times I was wanting to expand faster , ' ' says Mr. Landon , who tries to gulp down lunch while he answers questions . But his father , who is sitting quietly at the end of the table , cautioned against it. // ' ' My dad doesn ' t borrow a dime , ' ' Landon says .

In Missouri , a farm wife talks about cutting back to a simpler life. // How did the credit crunch happen ? // Forget for a moment everything you know about farming - the crops , livestock , heavy machinery , and the people . Look instead at farmland in the way an investor would. // Emanuel Melichar , senior economist with the Federal Reserve Board , explains it this way : // In the 1970s , for the third time this century , America ' s farm industry experienced a boom . Farmers , seeing the return on their assets more than triple , decided to expand . In doing so , they brought more marginal land into production and bid up farmland prices . In 1975 , the average value of an Iowa farm was $188 , 600 , according to the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) . Six years later , it would cost $556 , 000. // Even adjusting for inflation , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion in new wealth between 1972 and 1979 ( using 1983 dollars ) . That wealth was not just paper profits , but as with any growth stock , the boom would have to continue to sustain that wealth. // The boom , however , ended in the early ' 80s . Worldwide recession slackened demand for US food and fiber exports . Huge harvests built up supplies . Prices slumped. // Meanwhile , interest rates on farm loans , which averaged about 10 percent in the late ' 70s , would top 18 percent by 1981 . In 1983 , an average farmer ' s interest payments alone would account for 15 percent of total farm production expenses - twice the percentage of 1970 , says Terry L. Francl , agricultural economist with Continental Bank . High inflation , which used to ease the loan burden , was no longer. // Not surprisingly , land prices plummeted . From 1980 to 1983 , a third of that ' ' new wealth ' ' of the ' 70s disappeared the same way it was created , Mr. Melichar calculates . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 300. // Land values continue to drop . The latest USDA survey puts the average on April 1 down about 1 percent from a year ago . But the figure disguises bigger declines in the important farming regions of the Corn Belt and the Northern Plains. // How did farmers fare ? // If you were Wilfred Oldfather , a small northern Indiana farmer who drives a school bus on the side , you ' d be doing just fine , thank you. // His 450-acre farm is paid for . New equipment would be a luxury ( the farm ' s newest tractor is a 1961 model ) . Mr. Oldfather has no urge to borrow money and expand. // ' ' I haven ' t taken any of their money . And I ' m not about to , ' ' he says. // Other farmers , like Bob Weber , have expanded profitably. // In the early ' 60s , Mr. Weber , his father , and his brother incorporated their small 250-acre farm near Dorchester , Neb .

Weather losses and problems with the agency itself caused their debts to pile up . By 1982 , the net worth of their farm was a minus $7 , 000 . FmHA has tried to foreclose on them - so far , unsuccessfully. // Last year , 7 , 529 out of 270 , 000 FmHA borrowers left farming - most of them probably because of financial stress . In 1982 , the figure was higher - 8 , 227 . One-third of all FmHA farm loans were delinquent at the end of 1983. // The FmHA has been under special scrutiny by several rural and small-farm groups ( see accompanying story ) . But other farm lenders are having problems , too. // At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up substantially for the Farm Credit System , which holds the largest share of farm credit , up significantly for commercial banks ( 5. 3 percent delinquent ) , and up slightly for the Federal Land Banks ( 0. 5 percent ) . // Is this a farm crisis ? // ' ' I think we ' ve been through a very serious period , which we ' re not completely out of yet , ' ' says Frank Naylor , USDA undersecretary for small community and rural development , in an interview here . ' ' But on the other hand , I think it would be an injustice to paint the picture as a major crisis - or to say that the long-term and overall financial health of agriculture is not pretty good . It is. ' ' // The agricultural sector has ' ' over a trillion dollars of assets against $215 billion of debt . Most commercial businesses would love to have that balance sheet.

They pay it off with income , he says. // And one of the worrysome long-term trends in farming is that income has decreased in relation to overall farm debt. // ' ' The debt situation in agriculture should be of more concern , ' ' Professor Lins says . He sees two other troubling long-term trends : // // * There is less liquidity in agriculture . An increasing amount of farmers ' assets is tied up in real estate and machinery - items that are often hard to sell off . In a downturn , they can mean a loss. // // * Farmers are operating on narrower and narrower margins . In 1970 , they cleared as profit a quarter of their gross income . By 1981 , although a good income year , the figure was down to 18 percent. // Lins says this increases the industry ' s potential for boom and bust and makes it increasingly hard for government to control income through price supports. // The 1979 Soviet grain embargo is an obvious example , but there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised the price of farmland above what it otherwise would be , Lins says. // Thus some of the government programs intended to help have actually hurt some farmers. // Many economists say the moral of the current credit crunch seems to be that short-sighted government benevolence sometimes can become a long-term instrument of deception. // //
