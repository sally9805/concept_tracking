Politics is the art of the possible , and policy is a way of defining a problem so that it can be solved . By that definition , the Administration and the Congress have yet to produce sound politics or successful policy in response to the ongoing crisis in Nicaragua . The White House and Capitol Hill have both reverberated with one-sided and unrealistic assessments of the challenge in Nicaragua , with deceptive and diversionary claims about what the U.S. should be trying to accomplish there and with unconvincing recipes for what to do . The result is an impasse that may come to a head this week , one from which the Sandinistas themselves may emerge the only winners . <P> The Administration 's position is that the Sandinistas are , in a word that Secretary of State George Shultz has used repeatedly , " unacceptable . " The implication not only of that word but of much of the accompanying policy is that the Sandinistas must go . The Administration 's chosen instrument for attaining that goal is a U.S.-backed guerrilla war waged by the contras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contras seems to court defeat both in Washington , at the hands of an increasingly recalcitrant Congress , and in Nicaragua itself , at the hands of the Sandinistas . That is partly because the policy has taken on an all-or-nothing quality : either the U.S. succeeds in bringing about the overthrow of the Sandinistas , or there will be hell to pay both geopolitically ( Central America will be awash , in Reagan 's colorful phrase , in a " sea of red " ) and politically here at home ( the President 's political operatives are already eager to ask voters next November , " Who lost Nicaragua ? " ) . American inability to cope conclusively with such an antagonistic regime so close to home would certainly carry a price , potentially a heavy one . But the means to get rid of the Sandinistas are slim and risky . Since the Congress , much of the public and many independent experts doubt that the contras can achieve all that they and their Administration sponsors want , there is a growing temptation to give them nothing , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking for , or to give them so little , so late , that it would be meaningless . On the eve of the President 's speech appealing for the contra cause , which was scheduled for last Sunday night , a majority of the House , faced with a thumbs-up or thumbs-down choice , was leaning toward a cutoff of all U.S. aid to the contras and a pious but toothless exhortation to diplomacy . <P> What is needed , at this late and perhaps last-minute juncture , is for the Administration to redefine the problem in Nicaragua in a way that it can be solved , through diplomacy as well as military pressure , and then for the Congress to support the contras as a goad to diplomacy and to do so without attaching conditions that would mitigate or eliminate the pressure they actually exert on the Sandinistas . <P> The starting point for a fresh approach has to be a consensus about what Shultz 's depiction of the Sandinistas as unacceptable means , not in terms of anyone 's tastes and preferences but in terms of a policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is it that the U.S. can not accept about the junta in Managua ? And what must the U.S. do to transform the Sandinista regime into something the U.S. can live with ?
