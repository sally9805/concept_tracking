Investors who buy commodity-futures contracts bet on whether the price of such staples as silver and soybeans will rise or fall . Now they can earn truly heady rewards from wine futures . <P> Robert Mondavi Winery , based in Oakville , Calif. , is the first U.S. winemaker to offer such contracts on a nationwide basis . An investor who buys a $240 contract on a case of 1985 or 1986 Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve is betting that the wines will increase in value by 1989 . Because the contracts will bring in cash two years before the wines are usually sold , about 30 California vintners , including such names as Iron Horse and Diamond Creek , are following Mondavi 's lead .
