The Warsaw Pact meeting in Sofia , Bulgaria , last week was to have been the first gathering of the seven-member organization 's top leaders since January 1983 . It was considered particularly significant since it followed the resumption of U.S.-Soviet arms talks . Then came the brief announcement from TASS : the conference had been postponed . To many Kremlin watchers , there was only one possible explanation , as voiced by a senior British diplomat : " A deterioration in Soviet President Konstantin Chernenko 's health . " <P> Chernenko is thought to be suffering from chronic emphysema ; traveling during the cold snap that has gripped Europe might have worsened his condition at a time when disagreements among pact members require vigorous diplomacy . The treaty that established the alliance is up for renewal , and Hungary and Rumania are known to oppose Moscow 's desire to extend the agreement in perpetuity . Said a State Department Kremlinologist : " You do n't conquer recalcitrant allies from a wheelchair . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
