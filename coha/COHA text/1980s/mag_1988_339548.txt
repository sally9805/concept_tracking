Bradley Weidman thought he could bank on the sugarbowl remembrance of a 1930s child movie star when he named his new soft drink the Shirley T. What the 26- year-old entrepreneur from Encino , Calif. , did not count on was the marketing savvy of Shirley Temple Black , 60 , former Ambassador to Ghana and a Republican activist . Black , who has granted manufacturers 163 licenses in the past 50 years for everything from Shirley Temple dolls and music boxes to greeting cards , is suing Weidman for using her name without permission . <P> Weidman , whose sales reached $200,000 last year , defends his drink 's name by arguing that " Shirley Temple " has become part of the English language and thus is no longer a trademark . After all , he notes , when bartenders mix ginger ale and grenadine to make a Shirley Temple , they do not need Black 's permission . The difference , Black counters , is that bartenders , unlike Weidman , are not trying to push a product .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
