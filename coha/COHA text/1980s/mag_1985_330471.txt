In the unique ministry of the Rev. Jerry Falwell , a press conference is as comfortable a setting as a church service . There he was last week at New York City 's Kennedy Airport , smiling out at television crews and slightly incredulous reporters . His mission : to offer optimistic words of moral assurance about South Africa 's embattled white regime , whose leaders he had just met during a whirlwind five-day visit . He urged the good Christian folk of America to buy up gold Krugerrands and push U.S. " reinvestment " in South Africa . <P> The words provoked a nationwide furor , but Falwell persevered at a follow-up press conference in Washington and then on a series of TV shows . Through it all , the trademark Falwell manner was on public display : the presentation of disputatious and highly debatable assertions in tones of sweet reason , congeniality in the face of bitter attacks , an almost eerie confidence that he possessed insights his countrymen needed to hear about . <P> Falwell , 52 , did not need to depend only on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later for a few comments on his Old Time Gospel Hour , and for a fuller report on Jerry Falwell Live , which is transmitted to 34 million homes on Ted Turner 's WTBS cable-TV system each Sunday night . <P> Nor was South Africa Falwell 's only political concern last week . In an unlikely alliance with Civil Rights Leader Joseph Lowery and other clergy , he joined another press conference in Washington to decry alleged U.S. Government interference in religious freedoms . The group also contended that Cult Leader Sun Myung Moon had been railroaded in his tax-fraud conviction . <P> There was important work to do as well back home in Lynchburg , Va . Falwell met with the associate pastors who operate the huge Thomas Road Baptist Church during his many absences . He appeared as usual in his church 's octagonal sanctuary to preach at the Wednesday-night prayer meeting . His message , " Live Unto Him , " was loosely based upon II Corinthians 5 : 14-15 . The week concluded with a particularly pleasant chore : mingling amiably with the 3,500 en- tering freshmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to filling his roles at the Thomas Road Church , at the university and on TV , Falwell is the founder of Moral Majority , an organization of conservative Americans who lobby for such causes as school prayer and antiabortion legislation . This national political movement engenders passionate enthusiasm among its followers and a large measure of trepidation among many opponents . <P> Another aspect of Falwell 's crusade has received less attention but is at least as important in its implications . He is mobilizing and altering the consciousness of that once insular component of American religion known as Fundamentalism . Before Falwell , Fundamentalist preachers denounced evil in " the world " in order to compel their flocks into strict isolation from it . Nowadays those same jeremiads are a stern call to social action . " When I was growing up , " recalls Fundamentalist Pastor Keith Gephart of Alameda , Calif. , " I always heard that churches should stay out of politics . Now it seems almost a sin not to get involved . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
