That 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LEE That do n't mean a thing . You go down to the L.A. Police Department there and ask them what kinda ' people kill each other the most . What do you think they 'd say ? p. 36 AUSTIN Who said anything about killing ? LEE Family people . Brothers . Brothers-in-law . Cousins . Real American-type people . They kill each other in the heat mostly . In the Smog-Alerts . In the Brush Fire Season . Right about this time a ' year . AUSTIN This is n't the same . LEE Oh no ? What makes it different ? AUSTIN We 're not insane . We 're not driven to acts of violence like that . Not over a dumb movie script . Now sit down . ( long pause , LEE considers which way to go with it ) LEE Maybe not .

Does n't that mean somethin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Lee . I do n't mind writing it . I just do n't want to get all worked up about it . It 's not worth it . Now , come on . Let 's just get through it , okay ? LEE Nah . I think there 's easier money . Lotsa ' places I could pick up thousands . Maybe millions . I do n't need this shit . I could go up to Sacramento Valley and steal me a diesel . Ten thousand a week dismantling one a ' those suckers . Ten thousand a week ! ( LEE opens another beer , puts his foot back up on table ) p. 37 AUSTIN No , really , look , I 'll write it out for you . I think it 's a great idea . LEE Nah , you got yer own work to do .

Let 's leave the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's not gon na ' change but I will . I 'll just turn myself right inside out . I could be just like you then , huh ? Sittin ' around dreamin ' stuff up . Gettin ' paid to dream . Ridin ' back and forth on the freeway just dreamin ' my fool head off . AUSTIN It 's not all that easy . LEE It 's not , huh ? AUSTIN No . There 's a lot of work involved . LEE What 's the toughest part ? Deciding whether to jog or play tennis ? ( long pause ) AUSTIN Well , look . You can stay here  --  do whatever you want to . Borrow the car . Come in and out . Does n't matter to me . It 's not my house . I 'll help you write this thing or  --  not . Just let me know what you want . You tell me. p. 39 LEE Oh . So now suddenly you 're at my service . Is that it ? AUSTIN What do you want to do Lee ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dreams at windows ) LEE I tell ya ' what I 'd do if I still had that dog . Ya ' wan na ' know what I 'd do ? AUSTIN What ?

Just for the hell of it . Maybe you 've really got something here . What do you think ? ( pause , LEE considers ) LEE Maybe so . No harm in tryin ' I guess . You think it 's such a hot idea . Besides , I always wondered what 'd be like to be you . AUSTIN You did ? LEE Yeah , sure . I used to picture you walkin ' around some campus with yer arms fulla ' books . Blondes chasin ' after ya ' . AUSTIN Blondes ? That 's funny . LEE What 's funny about it ? AUSTIN Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEE Where 'd you picture me ? AUSTIN Oh , I do n't know . Different places . Adventures . You were always on some adventure . LEE Yeah . AUSTIN And I used to say to myself , " Lee 's got the right idea . He 's out there in the world and here I am . What am I doing ? " LEE Well you were settin ' yourself up for somethin ' . AUSTIN I guess . LEE We better get started on this thing then . AUSTIN Okay . ( AUSTIN sits up at typewriter , puts new paper in ) LEE Oh . Can I get the keys back before I forget ? ( AUSTIN hesitates ) You said I could borrow the car if I wanted , right ? Is n't that what you said ? AUSTIN Yeah . Right . ( AUSTIN takes keys out of his pocket , sets them on table , LEE takes keys slowly , plays with them in his hand ) LEE I could get a ranch , huh ? AUSTIN Yeah . We have to write it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( lights start dimming slowly to end of scene as AUSTIN types , LEE speaks ) So they take off after each other straight into an endless black prairie . The sun is just comin ' down and they can feel the night on their backs . What they do n't know is that each one of ' em is afraid , see . Each one separately thinks that he 's the only one that 's afraid . And they keep ridin ' like that straight into the night . Not knowing . And the one who 's chasin ' does n't know where the other one is taking him . And the one who 's being chased does n't know where he 's going . ( lights to black , typing stops in the dark , crickets fade ) @x Morning . LEE at the table in alcove with a set of golf clubs in a fancy leather bag , AUSTIN at sink washing a few dishes . AUSTIN He really liked it , huh ? LEE He would n't a ' gave me these clubs if he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? LEE Yeah . I told ya ' he gave me the clubs . The bag too . AUSTIN I thought he just loaned them to you . LEE He said it was part a ' the advance . A little gift like . Gesture of his good faith . AUSTIN He 's giving you an advance ? LEE Now what 's so amazing about that ? I told ya ' it was a good story . You even said it was a good story . AUSTIN Well that is really incredible Lee . You know how many guys spend their whole lives down here trying to break into this business ? Just trying to get in the door ? LEE ( pulling clubs out of bag , testing them ) I got no idea . How many ? ( pause ) p. 43 AUSTIN How much of an advance is he giving you ? LEE Plenty . We were talkin ' big money out there . Ninth hole is where I sealed the deal . AUSTIN He made a firm commitment ? LEE Absolutely . AUSTIN Well , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he likes something . LEE I thought you said you did n't know him . AUSTIN Well , I 'm familiar with his tastes . LEE I let him get two up on me goin ' into the back nine . He was sure he had me cold . You shoulda ' seen his face when I pulled out the old pitching wedge and plopped it pin-high , two feet from the cup . He ' bout shit his pants . " Where 'd a guy like you ever learn how to play golf like that ? " he says . ( LEE laughs , AUSTIN stares at him ) AUSTIN ' Course there 's no contract yet . Nothing 's final until it 's on paper . LEE It 's final , all right . There 's no way he 's gon na ' back out of it now . We gambled for it . AUSTIN Saul , gambled ? LEE Yeah , sure . I mean he liked the outline already so he was n't risking that much . I just guaranteed it with my short game . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or something . I think Mom left a bottle of champagne in the refrigerator . We should have a little toast . ( AUSTIN gets glasses from cupboard , goes to refrigerator , pulls out bottle of champagne ) LEE You should n't ought a ' take her champagne , Austin . She 's gon na ' miss that . AUSTIN Oh , she 's not going to mind . She 'd be glad we put it to good use . I 'll get her another bottle . Besides , it 's perfect for the occasion . ( pause ) LEE Yer gon na ' get a nice fee fer writin ' the script a ' course . Straight fee . ( AUSTIN stops , stares at LEE , puts glasses and bottle on table , pause ) AUSTIN I 'm writing the script ? LEE That 's what he said . Said we could n't hire a better screen-writer in the whole town . AUSTIN But I 'm already working on a script . I 've got my own project . I do n't have time to write two scripts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' drop that other one . ( pause ) AUSTIN What ? You mean mine ? He 's going to drop mine and do yours instead ? p. 45 LEE ( smiles ) Now look , Austin , it 's jest beginner 's luck ya ' know . I mean I sank a fifty foot putt for this deal . No hard feelings . ( AUSTIN goes to phone on wall , grabs it . starts dialing ) He 's not gon na ' be in , Austin . Told me he would n't be in ' till late this afternoon . AUSTIN ( stays on phone , dialing , listens ) I ca n't believe this . I just ca n't believe it . Are you sure he said that ? Why would he drop mine ? LEE That 's what he told me . AUSTIN He ca n't do that without telling me first . Without talking to me at least . He would n't just make a decision like that without talking to me ! LEE Well I was kinda ' surprised myself . But he was real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violently , paces ) AUSTIN What 'd he say ! Tell me everything he said ! LEE I been tellin ' ya ' ! He said he liked the story a whole lot . It was the first authentic Western to come along in a decade . AUSTIN He liked that story ! Your story ? LEE Yeah ! What 's so surprisin ' about that ? p. 46 AUSTIN It 's stupid ! It 's the dumbest story I ever heard in my life . LEE Hey , hold on ! That 's my story yer talkin ' about ! AUSTIN It 's a bullshit story ! It 's idiotic . Two lamebrains chasing each other across Texas ! Are you kidding ? Who do you think 's going to go see a film like that ? LEE It 's not a film ! It 's a movie . There 's a big difference . That 's somethin ' Saul told me . AUSTIN Oh he did , huh ? LEE Yeah , he said , " In this business we make movies , American movies . Leave the films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate with old Saul huh ? He started pouring forth his vast knowledge of Cinema . LEE I think he liked me a lot , to tell ya ' the truth . I think he felt I was somebody he could confide in . AUSTIN What 'd you do , beat him up or something ? LEE ( stands fast ) Hey , I 've about had it with the insults buddy ! You think yer the only one in the brain department here ? Yer the only one that can sit around and cook things up ? There 's other people got ideas too , ya ' know ! AUSTIN You must 've done something . Threatened him or something . Now what 'd you do Lee ? p. 47 LEE I convinced him ! ( LEE makes sudden menacing lunge toward AUSTIN , wielding golf club above his head , stops himself , frozen moment , long pause , LEE lowers club ) AUSTIN Oh , Jesus . You did n't hurt him did you ? ( long silence , LEE , sits back down at table ) Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do nothin ' to him ! He liked my story . Pure and simple . He said it was the best story he 's come across in a long , long time . AUSTIN That 's what he told me about my story ! That 's the same thing he said to me . LEE Well , he musta ' been lyin ' . He musta ' been lyin ' to one of us anyway . AUSTIN You ca n't come into this town and start pushing people around . They 're gon na ' put you away ! LEE I never pushed anybody around ! I beat him fair and square . ( pause ) They ca n't touch me anyway . They ca n't put a finger on me . I 'm gone . I can come in through the window and go out through the door . They never knew what hit ' em . You , yer stuck . Yer the one that 's stuck . Not me . So do n't be warnin ' me what to do in this town . ( pause , AUSTIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 48 AUSTIN Lee , come on , level with me will you ? It does n't make any sense that suddenly he 'd throw my idea out the window . I 've been talking to him for months . I 've got too much at stake . Everything 's riding on this project . LEE What 's yer idea ? AUSTIN It 's just a simple love story . LEE What kinda ' love story ? AUSTIN ( stands , crosses into kitchen ) I 'm not telling you ! LEE Ha ! ' Fraid I 'll steal it huh ? Competition 's gettin ' kinda ' close to home is n't it ? AUSTIN Where did Saul say he was going ? LEE He was gon na ' take my story to a couple studios . AUSTIN That 's my outline you know ! I wrote that outline ! You 've got no right to be peddling it around . LEE You were n't ready to take credit for it last night . AUSTIN Give me my keys ! LEE What ? AUSTIN The keys ! I want my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just give me my keys ! I got ta ' take a drive . I got ta ' get out of here for a while . p. 49 LEE Where you gon na ' go , Austin ? AUSTIN ( pause ) I might just drive out to the desert for a while . I got ta ' think . LEE You can think here just as good . This is the perfect setup for thinkin ' . We got some writin ' to do here , boy . Now let 's just have us a little toast . Relax . We 're partners now . ( LEE pops the cork of the champagne bottle , pours two drinks as the lights fade to black ) p. 50 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE 6 Afternoon . LEE and SAUL in kitchen , AUSTIN in alcove LEE Now you tell him . You tell him , Mr. Kipper . SAUL KIMMER Kimmer . LEE Kimmer . You tell him what you told me . He do n't believe me . AUSTIN I do n't want to hear it . SAUL KIMMER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was simply amazed by your brother 's story and  --  AUSTIN Amazed ? You lost a bet ! You gambled with my material ! SAUL KIMMER That 's really beside the point , Austin . I 'm ready to go all the way with your brother 's story . I think it has a great deal of merit . AUSTIN I do n't want to hear about it , okay ? Go tell it to the executives ! Tell it to somebody who 's going to turn it into a package deal or something . A T.V. series . Do n't tell it to me . SAUL KIMMER But I want to continue with your project too , Austin . It 's not as though we ca n't do both . We 're big enough for that are n't we ? AUSTIN " We " ? I ca n't do both ! I do n't know about " we . " p. 51 LEE ( to SAUL ) See , what 'd I tell ya ' . He 's totally unsympathetic . SAUL KIMMER Austin , there 's no point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It just does n't make sense . You 're brothers . You know each other . There 's a familiarity with the material that just would n't be possible otherwise . AUSTIN There 's no familiarity with the material ! None ! I do n't know what " Tornado Country " is . I do n't know what a " gooseneck " is . And I do n't want to know ! ( pointing to LEE ) He 's a hustler ! He 's a bigger hustler than you are ! If you ca n't see that , then  --  LEE ( to AUSTIN ) Hey , now hold on . I did n't have to bring this bone back to you , boy . I persuaded Saul here that you were the right man for the job . You do n't have to go throwin ' up favors in my face . AUSTIN Favors ! I 'm the one who wrote the fuckin ' outline ! You ca n't even spell . SAUL KIMMER ( to AUSTIN ) Your brother told me about the situation with your father . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAUL KIMMER That 's right . Now we have a clear-cut deal here , Austin . We have big studio money standing behind this thing . Just on the basis of your outline . p. 52 AUSTIN ( to SAUL ) What 'd he tell you about my father ? SAUL KIMMER Well  --  that he 's destitute . He needs money . LEE That 's right . He does . ( AUSTIN shakes his head , stares at them both ) AUSTIN ( to LEE ) And this little assignment is supposed to go toward the old man ? A charity project ? Is that what this is ? Did you cook this up on the ninth green too ? SAUL KIMMER It 's a big slice , Austin . AUSTIN ( to LEE ) I gave him money ! I already gave him money . You know that . He drank it all up ! LEE This is a different deal here . SAUL KIMMER We can set up a trust for your father . A large sum of money . It can be doled out to him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who 's doing the doling ? SAUL KIMMER Your brother volunteered . ( AUSTIN laughs ) LEE That 's right . I 'll make sure he uses it for groceries . AUSTIN ( to SAUL ) I 'm not doing this script ! I 'm not writing this crap for you or anybody else . You ca n't blackmail me into it . You ca n't threaten me into it . There 's no way I 'm doing it . So just give it up . Both of you . ( long pause ) p. 53 SAUL KIMMER Well , that 's it then . I mean this is an easy three hundred grand . Just for a first draft . It 's incredible , Austin . We 've got three different studios all trying to cut each other 's throats to get this material . In one morning . That 's how hot it is . AUSTIN Yeah , well you can afford to give me a percentage on the outline then . And you better get the genius here an agent before he gets burned . LEE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that right , Saul ? SAUL KIMMER That 's right . ( to AUSTIN ) Your brother has really got something , Austin . I 've been around too long not to recognize it . Raw talent . AUSTIN He 's got a lota ' balls is what he 's got . He 's taking you right down the river . SAUL KIMMER Three hundred thousand , Austin . Just for a first draft . Now you 've never been offered that kind of money before . AUSTIN I 'm not writing it . ( pause ) SAUL KIMMER I see . Well  --  LEE We 'll just go to another writer then . Right , Saul ? Just hire us somebody with some enthusiasm . Somebody who can recognize the value of a good story . p. 54 SAUL KIMMER I 'm sorry about this , Austin . AUSTIN Yeah . SAUL KIMMER I mean I was hoping we could continue both things but now I do n't see how it 's possible . AUSTIN So you 're dropping my idea altogether . Is that it ? Just trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SAUL KIMMER I wish there was another way . AUSTIN I 've got everything riding on this , Saul . You know that . It 's my only shot . If this falls through  --  SAUL KIMMER I have to go with what my instincts tell me  --  AUSTIN Your instincts ! SAUL KIMMER My gut reaction . AUSTIN You lost ! That 's your gut reaction . You lost a gamble . Now you 're trying to tell me you like his story ? How could you possibly fall for that story ? It 's as phony as Hoppalong Cassidy . What do you see in it ? I 'm curious . SAUL KIMMER It has the ring of truth , Austin . AUSTIN ( laughs ) Truth ? LEE It is true . SAUL KIMMER Something about the real West . p. 55 AUSTIN Why ? Because it 's got horses ? Because it 's got grown men acting like little boys ? SAUL KIMMER Something about the land . Your brother is speaking from experience . AUSTIN So am I ! SAUL KIMMER But nobody 's interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . LEE That 's right . AUSTIN ( to SAUL ) He 's been camped out on the desert for three months . Talking to cactus . What 's he know about what people wan na ' see on the screen ! I drive on the freeway every day . I swallow the smog . I watch the news in color . I shop in the Safeway . I 'm the one who 's in touch ! Not him ! SAUL KIMMER I have to go now , Austin . ( SAUL starts to leave ) AUSTIN There 's no such thing as the West anymore ! It 's a dead issue ! It 's dried up , Saul , and so are you . ( SAUL stops and turns to AUSTIN ) SAUL KIMMER Maybe you 're right . But I have to take the gamble , do n't I ? AUSTIN You 're a fool to do this , Saul . SAUL KIMMER I 've always gone on my hunches . Always . And I 've never been wrong . ( to LEE ) I 'll talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Kimmer . SAUL KIMMER Maybe we could have some lunch . LEE Fine with me. ( smiles at AUSTIN ) SAUL KIMMER I 'll give you a ring . ( SAUL exits , lights to black as brothers look at each other from a distance ) p. 57 Act 2 , Scene 3 SCENE 7 Night . Coyotes , crickets , sound of typewriter in dark , candlelight up on LEE at typewriter struggling to type with one finger system , AUSTIN sits sprawled out on kitchen floor with whiskey bottle , drunk .

Knock it off will ya ' ! I 'm tryin ' to concentrate here . AUSTIN ( laughs ) You 're tryin ' to concentrate ? LEE Yeah . That 's right . AUSTIN Now you 're tryin ' to concentrate .

AUSTIN You 're going to write an entire script on your own ? LEE That 's right . ( pause ) AUSTIN Here 's a thought . Saul Kimmer  --  LEE Shut up will ya ' ! AUSTIN He thinks we 're the same person . LEE Do n't get cute . AUSTIN He does ! He 's lost his mind . Poor old Saul . ( giggles ) Thinks we 're one and the same . LEE Why do n't you ease up on that champagne . AUSTIN ( holding up bottle ) This is n't champagne anymore . We went through the champagne a long time ago . This is serious stuff . The days of champagne are long gone . LEE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm enjoying your company , Lee . For the first time since your arrival I am finally enjoying your company . And now you want me to go outside and drink alone ? LEE That 's right . ( LEE reads through paper in typewriter , makes an erasure ) p. 59 AUSTIN You think you 'll make more progress if you 're alone ? You might drive yourself crazy . LEE I could have this thing done in a night if I had a little silence . AUSTIN Well you 'd still have the crickets to contend with . The coyotes . The sounds of the Police Helicopters prowling above the neighborhood . Slashing their searchlights down through the streets . Hunting for the likes of you . LEE I 'm a screenwriter now ! I 'm legitimate . AUSTIN ( laughing ) A screenwriter ! LEE That 's right . I 'm on salary . That 's more'n I can say for you . I got an advance coming . AUSTIN This is true . This is very true . An advance . ( pause ) Well , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at your trade . Since you 're doing so good at mine . LEE Ha ! ( LEE attempts to type some more but gets the ribbon tangled up , starts trying to re-thread it as they continue talking ) AUSTIN Well why not ? You do n't think I 've got what it takes to sneak into people 's houses and steal their T.V.s ? LEE You could n't steal a toaster without losin ' yer lunch . ( AUSTIN stands with a struggle , supports himself by the sink ) p. 60 AUSTIN You do n't think I could sneak into somebody 's house and steal a toaster ? LEE Go take a shower or somethin ' will ya ! ( LEE gets more tangled up with the typewriter ribbon , pulling it out of the machine as though it was fishing line ) AUSTIN You really do n't think I could steal a crumby toaster ? How much you wan na ' bet I ca n't steal a toaster ! How much ? Go ahead ! You 're a gambler are n't you ? Tell me how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your big advance ? Oh , you have n't got that yet have you . I forgot . LEE All right . I 'll bet you your car that you ca n't steal a toaster without gettin ' busted . AUSTIN You already got my car ! LEE Okay , your house then . AUSTIN What 're you gon na ' give me ! I 'm not talkin ' about my house and my car , I 'm talkin ' about what are you gon na ' give me . You do n't have nothin ' to give me . LEE I 'll give you  --  shared screen credit . How ' bout that ? I 'll have it put in the contract that this was written by the both of us . AUSTIN I do n't want my name on that piece of shit ! I want something of value . You got anything of value ? You got any tidbits from the desert ? Any Rattlesnake bones ? I 'm not a greedy man . Any little personal treasure will suffice . p. 61 LEE I 'm gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AUSTIN Oh , so now you 're gon na ' kick me out ! Now I 'm the intruder .

AUSTIN ( from floor ) My wife ? LEE Yeah . I mean maybe she can help ya ' out . Talk to ya ' or somethin ' . AUSTIN ( struggles to stand again ) She 's five hundred miles away . North . North of here . Up in the North country where things are calm . I do n't need any help . I 'm gon na ' go outside and I 'm gon na ' steal a toaster . I 'm gon na ' steal some other stuff too . I might even commit bigger crimes . Bigger than you ever dreamed of . Crimes beyond the imagination ! ( AUSTIN manages to get himself vertical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a minute , Austin . AUSTIN Why ? What for ? You do n't need my help , right ? You got a handle on the project . Besides , I 'm lookin ' forward to the smell of the night . The bushes . Orange blossoms . Dust in the driveways . Rain bird sprinklers . Lights in people 's houses . You 're right about the lights , Lee . Everybody else is livin ' the life . Indoors . Safe . This is a Paradise down here . You know that ? We 're livin ' in a Paradise . We 've forgotten about that . LEE You sound just like the old man now . p. 63 AUSTIN Yeah , well we all sound alike when we 're sloshed . We just sorta ' echo each other . LEE Maybe if we could work on this together we could bring him back out here . Get him settled down some place . ( AUSTIN turns violently toward LEE , takes a swing at him , misses and crashes to the floor again , LEE stays standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've had it with him ! I went all the way out there !

LEE They did ? ( they keep trading the bottle between them , taking drinks ) AUSTIN Yeah . They send him the money but it 's not enough money . Costs a lot to have all yer teeth yanked . They charge by the individual tooth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal to another tooth . Some are more expensive . Like the big ones in the back  --  LEE So what happened ? AUSTIN So he locates a Mexican dentist in Juarez who 'll do the whole thing for a song . And he takes off hitchhiking to the border . LEE Hitchhiking ? AUSTIN Yeah . So how long you think it takes him to get to the border ? A man his age . LEE I du n no . AUSTIN Eight days it takes him . Eight days in the rain and the sun and every day he 's droppin ' teeth on the blacktop and nobody 'll pick him up ' cause his mouth 's full a ' blood . ( pause , they drink ) So finally he stumbles into the dentist . Dentist takes all his money and all his teeth . And there he is , in Mexico , with his gums sewed up and his pockets empty . ( long silence , AUSTIN drinks ) p. 67 LEE That 's it ? AUSTIN Then I go out to see him , see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice Chinese dinner . But he does n't eat .

And then we go out to hit all the bars up and down the highway . Says he wants to introduce me to all his buddies . And in one a ' those bars , in one a ' those bars up and down the highway , he left that doggie bag with his teeth laying in the Chop Suey . LEE You never found it ? AUSTIN We went back but we never did find it . ( pause ) Now that 's a true story . True to life . ( they drink as lights fade to black ) p. 68 Act 2 , Scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . No crickets , coyotes yapping feverishly in distance before light comes up , a small fire blazes up in the dark from alcove area , sound of LEE smashing typewriter with a golf club , lights coming up , LEE seen smashing typewriter methodically then dropping pages of his script into a burning bowl set on the floor o alcove , flames leap up , AUSTIN has a whole bunch of stolen toasters lined up on the sink counter along with LEE 'S stolen T.

AUSTIN ( polishing toasters ) There 's gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning . Many , many unhappy , bewildered breakfast faces . I guess it 's best not to even think of the victims . Not to even entertain it . Is that the right psychology ? p. 69 LEE ( pauses ) What ? AUSTIN Is that the correct criminal psychology ? Not to think of the victims ? LEE What victims ? ( LEE takes another swipe at typewriter with nine-iron , adds pages to the fire ) AUSTIN The victims of crime . Of breaking and entering . I mean is it a prerequisite for a criminal not to have a conscience ? LEE Ask a criminal . ( pause , LEE stares at AUSTIN ) What 're you gon na ' do with all those toasters ? That 's the dumbest thing I ever saw in my life . AUSTIN I 've got hundreds of dollars worth of household appliances here . You may not realize that . LEE Yeah , and how many hundreds of dollars did you walk right past ? AUSTIN It was toasters you challenged me to . Only toasters . I ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's no challenge . Anybody can steal a toaster . ( LEE smashes typewriter again ) AUSTIN You do n't have to take it out on my typewriter ya ' know . It 's not the machine 's fault that you ca n't write . It 's a sin to do that to a good machine . p. 70 LEE A sin ? AUSTIN When you consider all the writers who never even had a machine . Who would have given an eyeball for a good typewriter . Any typewriter . ( LEE smashes typewriter again ) AUSTIN ( polishing toasters ) All the ones who wrote on matchbook covers . Paper bags . Toilet paper . Who had their writing destroyed by their jailers . Who persisted beyond all odds . Those writers would find it hard to understand your actions . ( LEE comes down on typewriter with one final crushing blow of the nine-iron then collapses in one of the chairs , takes a drink from bottle , pause ) AUSTIN ( after pause ) Not to mention demolishing a perfectly good golf club . What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you think he would 've said when he was batting balls around with broomsticks at the age of nine . Impoverished . ( pause ) LEE What time is it anyway ? AUSTIN No idea . Time stands still when you 're havin ' fun . LEE Is it too late to call a woman ? You know any women ? AUSTIN I 'm a married man . p. 71 LEE I mean a local woman . ( AUSTIN looks out at light through window above sink ) AUSTIN It 's either too late or too early . You 're the nature enthusiast . Ca n't you tell the time by the light in the sky ? Orient yourself around the North Star or something ? LEE I ca n't tell anything . AUSTIN Maybe you need a little breakfast . Some toast ! How ' bout some toast ?

I need a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . LEE I 'm not talkin ' about permanent . I 'm talkin ' about temporary .

See which one can produce a perfectly golden piece of fluffy toast . LEE How much , gas you got in yet car ? AUSTIN I have n't driven my car for days now . So I have n't had an opportunity to look at the gas gauge . p. 72 LEE Take a guess . You think there 's enough to get me to Bakersfield ? AUSTIN Bakersfield ? What 's in Bakersfield ?

With your determination and guts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( LEE pulls out his wallet , starts going through dozens of small pieces of paper with phone numbers written on them , drops some on the floor , drops others in the fire ) AUSTIN Very early . This is the time of morning when the coyotes kill people 's cocker spaniels . Did you hear them ? That 's what they were doing out there . Luring innocent pets away from their homes . LEE ( searching through his papers ) What 's the area code for Bakersfield ? You know ? AUSTIN You could always call the operator . LEE I ca n't stand that voice they give ya ' . p. 73 AUSTIN What voice ? LEE That voice that warns you that if you 'd only tried harder to find the number in the phone book you would n't have to be calling the operator to begin with . ( LEE gets up , holding a slip of paper from his wallet , stumbles toward phone on wall , yanks receiver , starts dialing ) AUSTIN Well I do n't understand why you 'd want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to me .

( LEE lets the phone drop then starts pulling all the drawers in the kitchen out on the floor and dumping the contents , searching for a pencil , AUSTIN watches him casually ) LEE ( crashing through drawers , throwing contents around kitchen ) This is the last time I try to live with people , boy ! I ca n't believe it . Here I am ! Here I am again in a desperate situation ! This would never happen out on the desert . I would never be in this kinda ' situation out on the desert .

You know what green eyes do to me ? AUSTIN I know but you 're not gon na ' get it on with her now anyway . It 's dawn already . She 's in Bakersfield for Christ 's sake . ( long pause , LEE considers the situation ) p. 77 LEE Yeah . ( looks at windows ) It 's dawn ? AUSTIN Let 's just have some toast and  --  LEE What is this bullshit with the toast anyway ! You make it sound like salvation or something . I do n't want any goddamn toast ! How many times I got ta ' tell ya ' ! ( LEE gets up , crosses upstage to windows in alcove , looks out , AUSTIN butters toast ) AUSTIN Well it is like salvation sort of . I mean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun 's coming up . It makes me feel like anything 's possible . Ya ' know ? LEE ( back to AUSTIN , facing windows upstage ) So go to church why do n't ya ' . AUSTIN Like a beginning . I love beginnings . LEE Oh yeah . I 've always been kinda ' partial to endings myself . AUSTIN What if I come with you , Lee ? LEE ( pause as LEE turns toward AUSTIN ) What ? AUSTIN What if I come with you out to the desert ? LEE Are you kiddin ' ? AUSTIN No . I 'd just like to see what it 's like . p. 78 LEE You would n't last a day out there pal . AUSTIN That 's what you said about the toasters . You said I could n't steal a toaster either . LEE A toaster 's got nothin ' to do with the desert . AUSTIN I could make it , Lee . I 'm not that helpless . I can cook . LEE Cook ? AUSTIN I can . LEE So what ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fires . I know how to get fresh water from condensation . ( AUSTIN stacks buttered toast up in a tall stack on plate ) ( LEE slams table ) LEE It 's not somethin ' you learn out of a Boy Scout handbook ! AUSTIN Well how do you learn it then ! How 're you supposed to learn it ! ( pause ) LEE Ya ' just learn it , that 's all . Ya ' learn it ' cause ya ' have to learn it . You do n't have to learn it . AUSTIN You could teach me . LEE ( stands ) What 're you , crazy or somethin ' ? You went to college . Here , you are down here , rollin ' in bucks . Floatin ' up and down in elevators . And you wan na ' learn how to live on the desert ! p. 79 AUSTIN I do , Lee . I really do . There 's nothin ' down here for me . There never was . When we were kids here it was different . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' down here thinkin ' it 's the fifties or somethin ' . I keep finding myself getting off the freeway at familiar landmarks that turn out to be unfamiliar . On the way to appointments . Wandering down streets I thought I recognized that turn out to be replicas of streets I remember . Streets I misremember . Streets I ca n't tell if I lived on or saw in a postcard . Fields that do n't even exist anymore . LEE There 's no point cryin ' about that now . AUSTIN There 's nothin ' real down here , Lee ! Least of all me ! LEE Well I ca n't save you from that ! AUSTIN You can let me come with you . LEE No dice , pal . AUSTIN You could let me come with you , Lee ! LEE Hey , do you actually think I chose to live out in the middle a ' nowhere ? Do ya ' ? Ya ' think it 's some kinda ' philosophical decision I took or somethin ' ? I 'm livin ' out there ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitchin ' to me about all yer success ! AUSTIN I 'd cash it all in in a second . That 's the truth . p. 80 LEE ( pause , shakes his head ) I ca n't believe this . AUSTIN Let me go with you . LEE Stop sayin ' that will ya ' ! Yer worse than a dog . ( AUSTIN offers out the plate of neatly stacked toast to LEE ) AUSTIN You want some toast ? ( LEE suddenly explodes and knocks the plate out of AUSTIN 'S hand , toast goes flying , long frozen moment where it appears LEE might go all the way this time when AUSTIN breaks it by slowly lowering himself to his knees and begins gathering the scattered toast from the floor and stacking it back on the plate , LEE begins to circle AUSTIN in a slow , predatory way , crushing pieces of toast in his wake , no words for a while , AUSTIN keeps gathering toast , even the crushed pieces ) LEE Tell ya ' what I 'll do , little brother . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade . ( AUSTIN continues gathering toast as LEE circles him through this ) You write me up this screenplay thing just like I tell ya ' . I mean you can use all yer usual tricks and stuff . Yer fancy language . Yer artistic hocus pocus . But ya ' got ta ' write everything like I say . Every move . Every time they run outa ' gas , they run outa ' gas . Every time they wan na ' jump on a horse , they do just that . If they wan na ' stay in Texas , by God they 'll stay in Texas ! ( Keeps circling ) And you finish the whole thing up for me . Top to bottom . And you put my name on it . And I own all the rights . And every dime goes in my pocket . You do that and I 'll sure enough take ya ' with me to the desert . ( LEE stops , pause , looks down at AUSTIN ) How 's that sound ? ( pause as AUSTIN stands slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close , pause ) p. 81 AUSTIN It 's a deal . ( LEE stares straight into AUSTIN 'S eyes , then he slowly takes a piece of toast off the plate , raises it to his mouth and takes a huge crushing bite never taking his eyes off AUSTIN 'S , as LEE crunches into the toast the lights black out ) p. 82 Act 2 , Scene 5 SCENE 9 Mid-day . No sound , blazing heat , the stage is ravaged ; bottles , toasters , smashed typewriter , ripped out telephone , etc . All the debris from previous scene is now starkly visible in intense yellow light , the effect should be like a desert junkyard at high noon , the coolness of the preceding scenes is totally obliterated . AUSTIN is seated at table in alcove , shirt open , pouring with sweat , hunched over a writing notebook , scribbling notes desperately with a ballpoint pen . LEE with no shirt , beer in hand , sweat pouring down his chest , is walking a slow circle around the table , picking his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as he walks ) All right , read it back to me . Read it back to me ! AUSTIN ( scribbling at top speed ) Just a second . LEE Come on , come on ! Just read what ya ' got . AUSTIN I ca n't keep up ! It 's not the same as if I had a typewriter . LEE Just read what we got so far . Forget about the rest . AUSTIN All right . Let 's see  --  okay  --  ( wipes sweat from his face , reads as LEE circles ) Luke says uh  --  p. 83 LEE Luke ? AUSTIN Yeah . LEE His name 's Luke ? All right , all right  --  we can change the names later . What 's he say ? Come on , come on . AUSTIN He says uh  --  ( reading ) " I told ya ' you were a fool to follow me in here . I know this prairie like the back a ' my hand . " LEE No , no , no ! That 's not what I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wrote . LEE It 's not what I said . I never said " like the back a ' my hand . " That 's stupid . That 's one a ' those  --  whadya ' call it ? Whadya ' call that ? AUSTIN What ? LEE Whadya ' call it when somethin 's been said a thousand times before . Whadya ' call that ? AUSTIN Um  --  a clich ? LEE Yeah . That 's right . Clich . That 's what that is . A clich . " The back a ' my hand . " That 's stupid . AUSTIN That 's what you said . LEE I never said that ! And even if I did , that 's where yer supposed to come in . That 's where yer supposed to change it to somethin ' better . p. 84 AUSTIN Well how am I supposed to do that and write down what you say at the same time ? LEE Ya ' just do , that 's all ! You hear a stupid line you change it . That 's yer job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEE What 're you changin ' it to ? AUSTIN I 'm not changing it . I 'm just trying to catch up . LEE Well change it ! We got ta ' change that , we ca n't leave that in there like that . " the back a ' my hand . " That 's dumb . AUSTIN ( stops writing , sits back ) All right . LEE ( pacing ) So what 'll we change it to ? AUSTIN Um  --  How ' bout  --  " I 'm on intimate terms with this prairie . " LEE ( to himself considering line as he walks ) " I 'm on intimate terms with this prairie . " Intimate terms , intimate terms . Intimate  --  that means like uh  --  sexual right ? AUSTIN Well  --  yeah  --  or  --  LEE He 's on sexual terms with the prairie ? How dya ' figure that ? p. 85 AUSTIN Well it does n't necessarily have to mean sexual . LEE What 's it mean then ? AUSTIN It means uh  --  close  --  personal  --  LEE All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uh  --  the line there . Read it back . Let 's see how it sounds . ( to himself ) " Intimate terms . " AUSTIN ( scribbles in notebook ) Okay . It 'd go something like this : ( reads ) " I told ya ' you were a fool to follow me in here . I 'm on intimate terms with this prairie . " LEE That 's good . I like that . That 's real good . AUSTIN You do ? LEE Yeah . Do n't you ? AUSTIN Sure . LEE Sounds original now . " Intimate terms . " That 's good . Okay . Now we 're cookin ! That has a real ring to it . ( AUSTIN makes more notes , LEE walks around , pours beer on his arms and rubs it over his chest feeling good about the new progress , as he does this MOM enters unobtrusively down left with her luggage , she stops and stares at the scene still holding luggage as the two men continue , unaware of her presence , AUSTIN absorbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) p. 86 LEE ( continues ) " He 's on intimate terms with this prairie . " Sounds real mysterious and kinda ' threatening at the same time . AUSTIN ( writing rapidly ) Good . LEE Now  --  ( LEE turns and suddenly sees MOM , he stares at her for a while , she stares back , AUSTIN keeps writing feverishly , not noticing , LEE walks slowly over to MOM and takes a closer look , long pause ) LEE Mom ? ( AUSTIN looks up suddenly from his writing , sees MOM , stands quickly , long pause , MOM surveys the damage ) AUSTIN Mom . What 're you doing back ? MOM I 'm back . LEE Here , lemme take those for ya . ( LEE sets beer on counter than takes both her bags but does n't know where to set them down in the sea of junk so he just keeps holding them ) AUSTIN I was n't expecting you back so soon . I thought uh  --  How was Alaska ? MOM Fine . LEE See any igloos ? MOM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MOM What ? AUSTIN It must 've been cold up there ? MOM Not really . LEE Musta ' been colder than this here . I mean we 're havin ' a real scorcher here . MOM Oh ? ( she looks at damage ) LEE Yeah . Must be in the hundreds . AUSTIN You wan na ' take your coat off , Mom ? MOM No. ( pause , she surveys space ) What happened in here ? AUSTIN Oh um  --  Me and Lee were just sort of celebrating and uh  --  MOM Celebrating ? AUSTIN Yeah . Uh  --  Lee sold a screenplay . A story , I mean . MOM Lee did ? AUSTIN Yeah . MOM Not you ? AUSTIN No . Him . MOM ( to LEE ) You sold a screenplay ? LEE Yeah . That 's right . We 're just sorta ' finishing it up right now . That 's what we 're doing here . p. 88 AUSTIN Me and Lee are going out to the desert to live . MOM You and Lee ? AUSTIN Yeah . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forth at each of them , pause ) You gon na go live with your father ? AUSTIN No . We 're going to a different desert Mom . MOM I see . Well , you 'll probably wind up on the same desert sooner or later . What 're all these toasters doing here ? AUSTIN Well  --  we had kind of a contest . MOM Contest ? LEE Yeah . AUSTIN Lee won . MOM Did you win a lot of money , Lee ? LEE Well not yet . It 's comin ' in any day now . MOM ( to LEE ) What happened to your shirt ? LEE Oh . I was sweatin ' like a pig and I took it off . ( AUSTIN grabs LEE 'S shirt off the table and tosses it to him , LEE sets down suitcases and puts his shirt on ) MOM Well it 's one hell of a mess in here is n't it ? p. 89 AUSTIN Yeah , I 'll clean it up for you , Mom . I just did n't know you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AUSTIN What happened ? MOM Nothing . I just started missing all my plants . ( she notices dead plants ) AUSTIN Oh . MOM Oh , they 're all dead are n't they . ( she crosses toward them , examines them closely ) You did n't get a chance to water I guess . AUSTIN I was doing it and then Lee came and  --  LEE Yeah I just distracted him a whole lot here , Mom . It 's not his fault . ( pause , as MOM stares at plants ) MOM Oh well , one less thing to take care of I guess . ( turns toward brothers ) Oh , that reminds me  --  You boys will probably never guess who 's in town . Try and guess . ( long pause , brothers stare at her ) AUSTIN Whadya ' mean , Mom ? MOM Take a guess . Somebody very important has come to town . I read it , coming down on the Greyhound. p. 90 LEE Somebody very important ? MOM See if you can guess . You 'll never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( points to writing pad ) MOM Picasso . ( pause ) Picasso 's in town . Is n't that incredible ? Right now . ( pause ) AUSTIN Picasso 's dead , Mom . MOM No , he 's not dead . He 's visiting the museum . I read it on the bus . We have to go down there and see him . AUSTIN Mom  --  MOM This is the chance of a lifetime . Can you imagine ? We could all go down and meet him . All three of us . LEE Uh  --  I do n't think I 'm really up fer meetin ' anybody right now . I 'm uh  --  What 's his name ? MOM Picasso ! Picasso ! You 've never heard of Picasso ? Austin , you 've heard of Picasso . AUSTIN Mom , we 're not going to have time . MOM It wo n't take long . We 'll just hop in the car and go down there . An opportunity like this does n't come along every day . AUSTIN We 're gon na ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 91 MOM Oh . LEE Yeah . ( pause ) MOM You 're both leaving ? LEE ( looks at AUSTIN ) Well we were thinkin ' about that before but now I  --  AUSTIN No , we are ! We 're both leaving . We 've got it all planned . MOM ( to AUSTIN ) Well you ca n't leave .

AUSTIN I 'm going with you , Lee ! MOM He 's too thin . LEE Yeah , he 'd just burn up out there . AUSTIN ( to LEE ) We just got ta ' finish this screenplay and then we 're gon na ' take off .

AUSTIN I ca n't postpone it ! It 's gone past postponing ! I 'm doing everything you said . I 'm writing down exactly what you tell me . LEE Yeah , but you were right all along see . It is a dumb story . " Two lamebrains chasin ' each other across Texas . " That 's what you said , right ? AUSTIN I never said that . ( LEE sneers in AUSTIN 'S face then turns to MOM ) LEE I 'm gon na ' just borrow some a ' your antiques , Mom . You do n't mind do ya ' ? Just a few plates and things . Silverware . ( LEE starts going through all the cupboards in kitchen pulling out plates and stacking them on counter as MOM and AUSTIN watch ) MOM You do n't have any utensils on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AUSTIN ( to LEE ) What 're you doing ? MOM Well some of those are very old . Bone China . LEE I 'm tired of eatin ' outa ' my bare hands , ya ' know . It 's not civilized . p. 93 AUSTIN ( to LEE ) What 're you doing ? We made a deal ! MOM Could n't you borrow the plastic ones instead ? I have plenty of plastic ones . LEE ( as he stacks plates ) It 's not the same . Plastic 's not the same at all . What I need is somethin ' authentic . Somethin ' to keep me in touch . It 's easy to get outa ' touch out there . Do n't worry I 'll get em ' back to ya ' . ( AUSTIN rushes up to LEE , grabs him by shoulders ) AUSTIN You ca n't just drop the whole thing , Lee ! ( LEE turns , pushes AUSTIN in the chest knocking him backwards into the alcove , MOM watches numbly , LEE returns to collecting the plates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight in the house . Go outside and fight . LEE I 'm not fightin ' . I 'm leavin ' . MOM There 's been enough damage done already . LEE ( his back to AUSTIN and MOM , stacking dishes on counter ) I 'm clearin ' outa ' here once and for all . All this town does is drive a man insane . Look what it 's done to Austin there . I 'm not lettin ' that happen to me . Sell myself down the river . No sir . I 'd rather be a hundred miles from nowhere than let that happen to me. ( during this AUSTIN has picked up the ripped-out phone from the floor and wrapped the cord tightly around both his hands , he lunges at LEE whose back is still to him , wraps the cord around LEE 'S neck , plants a foot in LEE 'S back and pulls back on the cord , tightening it , LEE chokes desperately , ca n't speak and ca n't reach AUSTIN with his arms , AUSTIN keeps applying pressure on LEE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink , MOM watches ) p. 94 AUSTIN ( tightening cord ) You 're not goin ' anywhere ! You 're not takin ' anything with you . You 're not takin ' my car ! You 're not takin ' the dishes ! You 're not takin ' anything ! You 're stayin ' right here ! MOM You 'll have to stop fighting in the house . There 's plenty of room outside to fight . You 've got the whole outdoors to fight in . ( LEE tries to tear himself away , he crashes across the stage like an enraged bull dragging AUSTIN with him , he snorts and bellows but AUSTIN hangs on and manages to keep clear of LEE 'S attempts to grab him , they crash into the table , to the floor , LEE is face down thrashing wildly and choking , AUSTIN pulls cord tighter , stands with one foot planted on LEE 'S back and the cord stretched taut ) AUSTIN ( holding cord ) Gim me back my keys , Lee ! Take the keys out ! Take ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets , searching for the car keys , MOM moves closer ) MOM ( calmly to AUSTIN ) You 're not killing him are you ? AUSTIN I do n't know .

AUSTIN Throw the keys out , Lee ! ( LEE finally gets keys out and throws them on floor but out of AUSTIN 'S reach , AUSTIN keeps pressure on cord , pulling LEE 'S neck back , LEE gets one hand to the cord but ca n't relieve the pressure ) Reach me those keys would ya ' , Mom .

All I got ta ' do is just tighten up . See ? ( he tightens cord , LEE thrashes wildly , AUSTIN releases pressure a little , maintaining control ) Ya ' see that ? p. 96 MOM That 's a savage thing to do . AUSTIN Yeah well do n't tell me I ca n't kill him because I can . I can just twist . I can just keep twisting . ( AUSTIN twists the cord tighter , LEE weakens , his breathing changes to a short rasp ) MOM Austin ! ( AUSTIN relieves pressure , LEE breathes easier but AUSTIN keeps him under control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm goin ' to the desert . There 's nothing stopping me . I 'm going by myself to the desert . ( MOM moving toward her luggage ) MOM Well , I 'm going to go check into a motel . I ca n't stand this anymore . AUSTIN Do n't go yet ! ( MOM pauses ) MOM I ca n't stay here . This is worse than being homeless . AUSTIN I 'll get everything fixed up for you , Mom . I promise . Just stay for a while . MOM ( picking up luggage ) You 're going to the desert . AUSTIN Just wait ! ( LEE thrashes , AUSTIN subdues him , MOM watches holding luggage , pause ) p. 97 MOM It was the worst feeling being up there . In Alaska . Staring out a window .

( she looks around the stage ) MOM I do n't recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AUSTIN makes a move toward her but LEE starts to struggle and AUSTIN subdues him again with cord , pause ) AUSTIN ( holding cord ) Lee ?

( LEE makes no response , AUSTIN slowly releases tension cord , still nothing from LEE ) AUSTIN Lee ? ( LEE is motionless , AUSTIN very slowly begins to stand , still keeping a tenuous hold on the cord and his eyes riveted to LEE for any sign of movement , AUSTIN slowly drops the cord and stands , he stares down at LEE who appears to be dead ) AUSTIN ( whispers ) Lee ? ( pause , AUSTIN considers , looks toward exit , back to LEE , then makes a small movement as if to leave . Instantly LEE is on his feet and moves toward exit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , keeping a distance between them . Pause , a single coyote heard in distance , lights fade softly into moonlight , the figures of the brothers now appear to be caught in a vast desert-like landscape , they are very still but watchful for the next move , lights go slowly to black as the after-image of the brothers pulses in the dark , coyote fades )
