The " fund-of-funds " concept is making a comeback among wealthy individual investors . Pooling investors ' money and then parceling it out among a dozen or more highflying independent money managers was all the rage in the 1960s . Bernard Cornfeld used it in his " Fund of Funds " empire that later collapsed at the hands of fugitive financier Robert Vesco , costing investors hundreds of millions of dollars . Today ' s pools are " private " limited partnerships , open only to a handful of well-heeled , supposedly sophisticated investors who can come up with a minimum investment ranging from $150 , 000 to $1 million . The sponsors  --  who often call themselves " managers of managers , " or " multimanager , multistrategy pools "  --  divvy up investors ' money among several managers selected for their contrasting and often unconventional investment styles and strategies . " It ' s about the best way to invest with the best and the brightest in the country , and not lose your money , " says Bear , Stearns &; Co. broker Peter Greer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients . For example , various pools have hired short-sale specialists Feshbach Brothers of Palo Alto , Calif. , who sell borrowed stock hoping to profit by replacing shares later at a lower price ; corporate raiders Coniston Partners of New York ; and New York hedge fund operator Michael Steinhardt . ( Hedge funds typically take highly leveraged , often short-term positions in stocks , bonds , options and other securities . ) While each approach can be very risky used in isolation , studies show that blending such strategies can cut risk . " When you combine all these people that do different things together , you get a portfolio that outperforms the S &; 500 significantly , with maybe half the volatility , " says George A. Hambrecht , New York-based partner in one of the new partnership pools , Paradigm Partners Inc . Moreover , pool organizers say , individual investors acting alone would need as much as $10 million to $20 million in some cases to hire the same hotshot managers . Big pension funds act something like funds of funds themselves , hiring platoons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wash. - based Frank Russell Co. and Evaluation Associates Inc. of Norwalk , Conn. , have attracted billions of dollars from institutional investors with large pooled funds , mainly using managers making conventional stock and bond investments . Some other funds use a group of managers all dealing in a specialized area , such as venture capital or real estate . Other institutional investors have used the fund-of-funds idea to produce solid returns . For instance , the Common Fund of Fairfield , Conn. , a nonprofit group that started a pooled stock fund in 1971 , now runs $1. 5 billion for 400 college endowments . The fund , with 26 outside managers , has risen an average of 18. 5% a year for the past decade against 16. 3% for the Standard &; Poor ' s 500-stock index . Some wealthy individuals , too , are getting high returns . Chicago-based Grosvenor Capital Management Inc. , one of the largest multistrategy pool operators , uses 20 to 25 managers with at least eight investment approaches ; it has a 10-year return topping 20% annually . " We don ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we ' ll do better in a down market because of the diversification , " says Grosvenor head Richard Elden . " There is no way of predicting " which strategy will make money in any given quarter because the markets are constantly changing , Mr. Elden says . " But that ' s what gives you stability . " There are some pitfalls , however , in the fund-of-funds approach , the biggest being that investors pay fees on top of fees . The pool organizer takes 1% to 2% of assets a year , and sometimes an additional administration fee . Then , all the outside money managers also must be paid . They usually bet on their own performance , taking 20% of the annual profits they produce , while getting nothing if investors suffer losses . All that can be a deep bite . " You ' re going to pay fees like you wouldn ' t believe , " says S. Donald Sussman , head of the $300 million Paloma Partners Ltd . " The only way you make money with us is to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sussman also points to Paloma ' s record of almost 20% annual returns , with risk far lower than the overall stock market . Other pools also have beaten the market : One private survey of six multistrategy pools operating since 1983 found that five outperformed the average annual return of the S &; 500 over the six-year period though 1988 . And they exposed investors to much lower risk than owning the S &; 500 stocks , the survey found . Newport Beach , Calif. , pension consultant Budge Collins says of the money managers used in the multistrategy pools , " It ' s the best group of investment managers that we ' ve ever found . " Jan Greer , senior vice president of Frank Russell Co. , which has just begun a fund of funds with diversified strategies for rich individual investors , says , " Most of these nontraditional managers are very keen not to lose money because they have their own money involved . " The pooled partnerships attract little publicity , in part because some fund sponsors and their clients , many of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like privacy . But there are also legal restrictions . The funds are offered only to wealthy investors on a private basis to avoid registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission . Advertising is banned , and the number of investors in a private partnership is limited to 99 . Many partnerships won ' t let an investor withdraw money until year-end , a negative for the skittish . Finding above-average managers with contrasting investment strategies isn ' t easy . " We look under a lot of rocks . You can ' t look in a directory and find these guys , " says Donald R. Morken of Genesee Partners , a Bellevue , Wash. , partnership . To attract prospective investors , the partnerships all try to sign up today ' s hot managers , even though some of those advisers almost certainly will have a cold hand tomorrow . The competition for managers is getting tougher as more pool partnerships are pulled together , each searching for rising stars . Sometimes pools pool themselves . A Frank Russell Co. pool , for example , has a stake in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money managers who actually make investments . The business " can be very incestuous , " says Mr. Hambrecht .
