The French have long enjoyed all-Champagne meals , as have the English , particularly for festive occasions . Many Americans are now considering imbibing only the bubbly for their New Year ' s feasts. // " There seems to be a greater interest in serving Champagne throughout a meal , " said Smitty Kogan , director of the Champagne News and Information Bureau , which represents the French Champagne industry . " We are getting more and more requests for suggestions of what to serve with Champagne. " // Sparkling wines from many regions and countries can be served throughout the meal . But for the greatest variety in styles and taste , it pays to concentrate on French Champagnes , the sparkling wines from the Champagne region. // The operative principle here is to think of Champagne not as one wine but as a category of wines - with bubbles . Champagnes are made in various styles , from gauzy and delicate to richly robust , in tints from pale gold to deep blush . Champagnes served with dinner should be selected to complement the foods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distinctive style , typified by its nonvintage brut . Some , like Laurent-Perrier , Ruinart and Taittinger , seek lightness and elegance . Others , including Krug , Bollinger and Veuve Clicquot-Ponsardin , make richer , more complex products . In addition to a nonvintage brut , most houses produce two to six other Champagnes. // A Champagne ' s flavor and body is determined in part by the blend of grapes : white , black or both . Taste , balance and intensity are also affected by the wine ' s acidity , whether it was fermented in oak and how long it has aged . The sweetness is controlled by the dosage , or the amount of sugared liqueur added before the final corking . Champagnes range in sweetness from the driest , or extra brut , to brut , extra dry , dry and demisec , or half-dry . Nonvintage Champagnes are younger and fresher than vintage ones . Maurice Cense , the export director for Mumm , recommends progressing from light to full-bodied , from young to older . He would start with blanc de blancs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , go on to nonvintage brut , then to vintage brut and finally to vintage rose . Remi Krug , the managing director of Krug , said , " A successful Champagne dinner has a structure , an architecture , if you will . " Many Champagne dinner menus created for the House of Krug begin with a nonvintage Grande Cuvee , followed by a Krug vintage , ending with Krug rose . Mr. Krug also recommends experimenting and cautions against becoming intimidated by rules. // Not as a rule , but in general , most Champagne dinners start with seafood , often oysters , followed by a fish dish or soup , a light meat or game dish and finally , a dessert of restrained sweetness . Dishes prepared with a white wine or Champagne sauce are always suitable. // Salmon , bass and lobster are also superb with Champagne . So are cream soups. // Cold foie gras is frequently served with Champagne as an appetizer , as is rabbit in a terrine or in a warm salad . Rabbit is also served as a main course . Poultry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative choices for a main course , along with sweetbreads and delicate veal dishes . Lamb can be served with a fruity rose . Sauces and seasonings for these meats tend to be subtle . A whiff of truffle or a spoonful of mustard will suffice. // Many Champagne menus feature vegetables like cabbage , leeks , fennel or celery root delicately braised or used as wrappings for seafood . Garlic and forceful spices are risky . Joseph Thuet , the executive chef for Moet &; Chandon , said salads with sharp dressings , pungent cheeses , highly aromatic fruits and mint flavors should also be avoided . So should chocolate. // There is considerable disagreement over which Champagnes to serve with dessert . Mireille Giuliano , the vice president for communications at Veuve Clicquot , said , " Although some people like to serve the cuvee speciale or brut with dessert , I find it doesn ' t work and I ' ll either serve demi-sec or nothing . " Others prefer a rose Champagne . Dessert should not be excessively sweet . Nuts , figs , strawberries , apples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As delicious as caviar and truffles are with Champagne , luxury ingredients are not necessary . A rustic choucroute garnie is excellent . Mr. Rosengarten and Mr. Wesson recommend deep-fried foods ; Champagne ' s acidity , they explained , cuts the grease . They suggest vegetable tempura and miniature spring rolls. // " Remember that once you open a bottle of Champagne you add glamour to the dinner , so you should be in the mood for that , " Mr. Krug said. // It even elevates Chinese takeout .
