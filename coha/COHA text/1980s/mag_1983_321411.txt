A musical La Cage aux Folles <P> Scientists can peer inside the body and brain , and measure wind speed on Mars . But the chemical reaction between performers onstage and an audience a few feet below defies explanation . If a show works , its flaws are easily forgiven and the faces out front light up with enthusiasm . If it does not , those onstage are subjected to the theatrical world 's most terrifying noise : the sound of hundreds of yawns , politely stifled . So perhaps it is best not to spend too long trying to explain the attractions of the musical version of La Cage aux Folles , which opened on Broadway Sunday night . The chemistry is right , and it is hard to imagine an audience that will not leave the Palace Theater fairly glowing with delight . <P> The broad appeal of the show , which broke all house records during its seven-week trial run in Boston , is all the more extraordinary given its theme . Behind Jerry Herman 's old-fashioned but tuneful score is a radical subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference : it celebrates the romance of two middle-aged homosexual men , one of whom is a transvestite . Last year and La Cage , for which Fierstein wrote the book , seems almost certain to become the first successful gay musical . Broadway is out of the closet and has slammed the door behind it . <P> La Cage aux Folles ( literally " Cage of Crazies " ; in French slang , " Cage of Gays " ) is based on Jean Poiret 's farce of the same title , which ran in Paris from 1973 to 1980 ; and it resembles the film starring Ugo Tognazzi and Michel Serrault , which became the most successful foreign-language movie ever shown in the U.S. , grossing more than $40 million . <P> La Cage aux Folles is a Saint-Tropez drag club run by Georges . Its star performer is the incredible Zaza , who , when he takes off his dress and wig , is also Albin , Georges 's lover for 20 years . Years ago , just to see what all the heterosexual fuss was about , Georges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a showgirl . From that brief union came a son , Jean-Michel , who has lived ever since with Georges and Albin ( George Hearn ) in an apartment next door to La Cage . <P> Now , however , Jean-Michel ( John Weiner ) has a problem . He wants to get married , but the girl of his choice is the daughter of France 's own Jerry Falwell , head of the T.F.M. , the Tradition , Family and Morality party . How is poor Jean-Michel to explain his family , its tradition and its morality to that pious fanatic ? <P> He does not plan to . When his fiancee and her parents visit , he wants to pass Georges off as a retired diplomat , bring in his real mother , whom he has not seen for 20 years , and exile Albin for the night . <P> Georges gives in , but Albin protests being hidden away . In one of the show 's best numbers , which might well be adopted as the anthem of Gay Liberation , he sings , <P> I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . .
