The gathering was held in his absence , a highly unusual development . In what appeared an effort to offset the impact on public confidence , the meeting ended with a resolution that " unanimously approved and supported the profound appraisals and conclusions " set out by Mr. Andropov in a speech read to the delegates in his name , urging greater efforts to carry out his program of limited economic change. // On Wednesday , many of the same delegates will assemble for a session of the Supreme Soviet , the nominal Parliament , which will approve the budget and economic plan for next year . <> <> The Talk of Moscow // In offices , restaurants , and beer halls across Moscow , Mr. Andropov ' s failure to appear for the Central Committee meeting was widely discussed . Ordinary Russians appeared to be drawn to the same conclusion as Western analysts : that Mr. Andropov ' s illness is likely to be more than what the Kremlin has described as a cold . " Anybody can see that it is serious , " an office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee meeting and from the Red Square festivities on Nov. 7 marking the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 . All told , Mr. Andropov has not been seen in public for more than four months , nearly a third of his time in office , which he assumed in November 1982 on the death of Leonid I. Brezhnev. // Now 69 years of age , Mr. Andropov was regarded at the time of his appointment as a transitional figure , to be replaced within a few years , but the speed with which he has been overtaken by illness has been a cause for surprise and , among supporters of his disciplinarian brand of politics , for dismay. // Some of his supporters were reassured by the assertive tone of the speech on the economy that was read on Mr. Andropov ' s behalf and by the promotion of four of his loyalists to top positions on the Politburo and in the party ' s Secretariat . Together , these moves created an aura of momentum. // " It is an unusual situation , " said a Western envoy . " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physically weak , perhaps dying , and on the other , you see his political constituency gaining ground , at the expense of his rivals . It is a combination without precedent , but in the circumstances I would say that they have contained the potential for instability pretty well. " // Against this view stood the fact that Russians emerged from the Brezhnev era with an apparent urge for a strong leader , a " khozyain , " or master figure , to take a grip on the drift that beset national life . With the crackdown on bureaucratism , corruption and sloth , Mr. Andropov went a long way to meeting this yearning , but the stimulus that this gave to national confidence has been ebbing as the weeks of his absence have lengthened . <> <> No Details on Illness // Although 131 days have passed since Mr. Andropov last appeared in Moscow , at a meeting with nine United States senators on Aug. 18 , the Kremlin has tried to seal the leadership off from popular curiosity by disclosing virtually nothing about the party leader ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is suffering from a cold , but almost no one seems to believe it. // That something more serious was amiss was suggested by photographs and television footage of Mr. Andropov in the months before his disappearance , showing a man who had lost weight and seemed drawn and pallid. // After Mr. Andropov ' s absence from the Revolution Day parade through Red Square , many people expected to hear any day that he had died or been replaced. // His policies appeared to receive less prominence in the press , and there were people who wondered whether the Brezhnev loyalists in the Politburo , identified mainly with Konstantin U. Chernenko , who ranks second after Mr. Andropov , might be taking the occasion to dig in and even reverse some of Mr. Andropov ' s initiatives. // In the midst of this , Defense Minister Dmitri F. Ustinov made a statement of the military ' s support for Mr. Andropov to a gathering of senior officers in the Soviet Army Theater , and momentum was regained. // The personnel changes announced after the Central Committee session on Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the leadership , at least as long as Mr. Andropov is able to stay in touch with developments in the Kremlin . The Central Committee is the forum in which a new party leader would be selected , and the absence of any such action suggests that Mr. Andropov will continue in office despite whatever ailment is keeping him away. // In fact , his political position has been strengthened by the new appointments , and these in turn indicate that the constituencies that placed him in the top job in the first place - the military , the K.G.B. and a cadre of party officials - are firmly in control. // Inevitably , attention will focus on the men around Mr. Andropov who have been managing the country in his absence , and from among whom his eventual successor is likely to emerge . One report circulating in recent weeks said that Marshal Ustinov has been presiding at Politburo meetings in Mr. Andropov ' s absence , although normally this function would seem to fall on Mr. Chernenko , as the second-ranking man in the party ' s Secretariat. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of 75 , is thought more likely to play a kingmaker ' s role than to seek the top job for himself . <> <> Candidates for Succession // Past experience indicates that a likely candidate for succession to the post of general secretary must already by one of the party secretaries and also hold a seat on the Politburo . Before the latest personnel shifts , three men fell in that category . They were Mr. Chernenko , 72 years old , who had been passed over once before , when Mr. Andropov succeeded Mr. Brezhnev , and two younger men , Grigory V. Romanov , 60 , and Mikhail S. Gorbachev , 52. // Although the promotion of the four Andropov loyalists on Monday did not add any other names to the select list of people who sit both on the Politburo and in the Secretariat , one of the four is thought to have potential as a future leader. // He is Vitaly I. Vorotnikov , 57 , the Premier of the Russian Republic , the largest of the Soviet Union ' s 15 states , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status to full member in the Politburo . Mr. Vorotnikov has made a meteoric rise into the Soviet leadership group in the past year and appears strongly favored by Mr. Andropov. // //
