But the terrorist actions of this fundamentalist Shiite Muslim organization are decidedly public . Its latest act appeared to be the hijacking Friday of a TWA jet carrying more than 100 Americans . Although there are conflicting reports about who is actually behind the hijacking , it bears the markings of an Islamic Jihad operation. // // The common thread is hostage-taking. // Over the past year , the group has abducted , detained , and threatened to execute eight Americans and two French diplomats in Beirut . It has also claimed responsibility for truck bombings of US embassy buildings and US and French military barracks in Beirut. // But if its acts are public , the organization itself is not . Islamic Jihad ( or ' ' Islamic Holy War ' ' ) is one of two major clandestine Shiite organizations in the Arab world that are linked to Iran. // The other is the ' ' al-Dawa al-Islamia ' ' ( Islamic Call Party ) , which is centered among antiregime Shiites in Iraq and the Persian Gulf states . Most of its operations have focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the 17 held in Kuwaiti prisons for December 1983 attacks against the US and French embassies there. // The Islamic Jihad is also regional in its operational focus , although it was spawned among the radical Shiites in Lebanon. // Most qualified observers agree the number of ' ' card carrying ' ' Islamic Jihad members is small . ' ' Perhaps 10 to 15 core people in Lebanon and corresponding small numbers in the Persian Gulf and Iraq , ' ' guesses one expert . But in Lebanon , these cadres swim in a sea of lawless militiamen and general anarchy . It is easy for Islamic Jihad to find recruits in Lebanon for specific operations. // Lebanon ' s largest Shiite militia group - Amal ( meaning ' ' hope ' ' ) - is run by the relatively moderate Nabih Berri . Along with the radicals , Amal has participated in Shiite resistance to the three-year Israeli occupation of south Lebanon. // But Amal has split with the ' ' Hizbullah ' ' ( Party of God ) , the largest breakaway Shiite organization in Lebanon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jihad terrorists is undoubtedly easy. // Sheikh Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah is a charismatic Shiite religious leader whose name has been associated with both Hizbullah and the terrorist activities of Islamic Jihad . Fadlallah concedes that he urges opposition to US and other foreign influences in Lebanon. // In a recent interview reported by the Middle East Insight publication , he was quoted as saying : ' ' The Muslims believe that you struggle by transforming yourself into a living bomb like you struggle with a gun in your hand . There is no difference between dying with a gun in your hand or exploding yourself , but I do not tell them , I do not specify for example , blow yourself up. ' ' // Shiite terrorism against Western and moderate Arab targets derives directly from the revolutionary methods of Iran and also from the political awakening of a long-deprived people . In Lebanon , the Shiites make up at least 44 percent of the population and have long been the country ' s largest but least influential sect. // In the shifting power balances following the Israeli invasion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their potential strength . They perceive Western influences as opposing purist Shiites ' political and religious objectives. // Are terrorist actions undertaken by the Islamic Jihad done at the orders of Iran ? // Certainly Iranian influence , through its 650-man Revolutionary Guard contingent in the Bekaa Valley region of Lebanon , is a key stimulant to radical Shiite behavior. // Some unconfirmed reports say that a secret committee of the Revolutionary Guard in Tehran , the ' ' War Against Satan Committee , ' ' plans , pays for , and runs the most important terrorist operations . Lebanese intelligence has accused the Iranian Embassy in Beirut of funding radical Shiite elements . But the exact nature of the Iranian connection remains unclear. // The US government places the responsibility for Islamic Jihad activities squarely on Iran .
