The tape measure is as fundamental to clothing construction as the stethoscope is to medical practice , and menswear design is the most precise of the fashion disciplines . Cecilia Metheny is a menswear designer who can ' t read a ruler . Knowing left and right are basic to setting sleeves , cuffs , collars , zippers and buttonholes . Metheny has trouble differentiating left from right , up from down . Furthermore , she can ' t pick up a telephone and , with any assurance , punch the correct digits . Nor can she memorize style numbers on samples or recite her Social Security number . If she starts to say a complicated word , she never knows if it will come out right . Metheny has a learning disability that relates to linear order . By all odds , this impairment should have smartly siphoned her right out of an industry that gobbles up would-be fashion designers like so many peas on a plate . Burgeoning business - +-  Yet she and her second husband , attorney-businessman Fred Henry , run a 3-year-old company that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s clothes on full-color pages in slick magazines such as GQ . From eight stores in 1985 , the Cecilia Metheny label is now carried by 30 of the best , including Neiman Marcus , Bergdorf Goodman , Macy ' s and Saks Fifth Avenue . Just this year , she won the Pantone Color Institute Award for outstanding use of color in fashion design . She was nominated for a Cutty Sark Menswear Award for most promising American designer . Her successes have been won through tenacity and determination . Now 40 , the Kentucky native grew up on a cattle and tobacco farm and enrolled in 1964 at Western Kentucky University to major in political science and speech . She gave up the idea of law school because she had always had trouble memorizing , outlining and giving proper chronology to events . She moved to Washington , D.C. , got married and became co-owner of a film production company ; she studied sculpture and later commuted to New York for acting classes . " Given enough time , I could learn lines . But when I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out first , then the fourth , then the second . . . . A friend suggested that I have myself tested , " Metheny recalls . Disability and divorce - +-  That was 1978 , the year she learned she had a type of dyslexia called dyscalculia , or the inability to grasp sequential order . Meanwhile , her marriage was collapsing . Metheny ' s relief at knowing what was the matter with her soon turned to panic : " Oh my God , ' I thought , What am I going to do ? Everything in the world is right-to-left and linear , and even making an outline is torment for me . ' " In 1980 , she moved to Pennsylvania to live with Henry and his three small children . " It was a beautiful place and a good life , but it wasn ' t enough . I had to express myself through work . I wrote down everything I had ever done and got an insight-I had to think not in terms of what do I want to be ' but what can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t worth the struggle . So I thought about color . You can ' t have a play without words , but you can have color without words . There ' s no numerical order . Textiles would be a way I could communicate with the eye and with the touch of the hand . " An uphill battle Applying to fashion school in 1982 , she had no idea what she was letting herself in for . Dyslexia specialists say that the condition is especially taxing for fashion students . Despite that , she chose the most rigorous training arena anywhere : The formidable Fashion Institute of Technology occupies an entire city block in New York ' s garment district , has an annual budget of $62 million and offers 26 majors and two master ' s degree programs to 4 , 000 full-time day students and 6 , 000 more part-time ones . " When I wanted to enroll , the textile program didn ' t start for six months , and I wouldn ' t wait . They had an accelerated program in fashion design that combined two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalls days that started at 7 a. m. and went on for 18 hours . " When everyone else would go home at 9 o ' clock , I ' d be still working at 2 a. m . " Sketch , drape , cut - +-  Fashion design majors at F.I.T. , in addition to knowing a core curriculum of history , marketing and other subjects , are expected to be architects of pliable materials . They must learn to sketch an idea , drape and cut muslin patterns on mannequins , transfer them to paper and , using math and geometry , grade them for sizes 2 to 20 . Then comes the engineering-cutting , sewing , pressing and finishing . " The worst for me was sewing , " Metheny says . " I sewed backwards , I threaded the needle backwards , I put the cuff on the wrong sleeve and I installed a man ' s trouser zipper like a woman ' s . " Patternmaking was no fun , either . Nor was draping class . The work took her three times longer to complete . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' terrified me . " One teacher helped her make a paper ruler-one fold was equivalent to a certain fraction of an inch . Another gave her four hours in which to complete two-hour exams . " You can ' t time ' dyslexics . It scatters the computer , " Metheny says . Words of discouragement - +-  Other professors were less compassionate . One refused to answer her many questions and snapped , " I ' m not going to talk to you . You ' re slowing down the rest of the class . " A draping instructor , seeing that Metheny had all the pins in backward , became so angry that she ripped out the pins and hurled the muslin to the floor . " The work was correct , but she said I didn ' t belong in her class , that I was too stupid . I went into the bathroom and cried . . . then I went back to class . " She never complained to any deans or administrators because , stoically , she considered the problem hers , not theirs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school inaugurated a program to identify and assist the learning disabled , even though they accounted for only about 3 percent of the student body . Metheny declares that " three of my 20 professors were impossible . The rest were great . Very patient , as if they sensed my integrity and my desire to learn . " Making the grade - +-  Even though she flunked math-oriented questions on fiber and fabrics exams , Metheny completed the program on time . In some instances , she had started out with F ' s and ended up with A ' s . She earned high marks in drawing , color development , textiles , textile rendering , creative writing and writing/composition ( with a spelling-correcting typewriter ) . Fred Henry , whom she married in 1984 , suggested backing her in business . Since then , life has been sweeter . The Henrys had a baby son three years ago . " Now , when I come in the office and it takes me six tries to dial a number , I know I ' m having a dyslexia day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess the best thing about it is that it has made me tolerant , and concerned with being human . It ' s easy ( in this industry ) to make big money ( by ) using and abusing . That ' s not what I want.
