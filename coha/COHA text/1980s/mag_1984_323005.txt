Cuba makes a deal with the U.S. to take back some undesirables <P> In the demonology of the Reagan Administration , Fidel Castro 's Cuba ranks high , probably somewhere between Libya and Nicaragua . The only serious U.S. combat action in a decade has been against Cubans , during last year 's Grenada invasion , and the Administration has refused even to consider fullscale , formal diplomatic relations . Thus it seemed a bit out of character when the White House last week announced a deal to re-establish immigration arrangements , the first agreement between the U.S. and Cuba since 1977 . Castro will take back as many as 2,746 criminals and mental patients he dispatched to the U.S. along with thousands of other Mariel boat people in 1980 . In return , the U.S. will begin accepting once again an orderly stream of Cuban immigrants , as well as about 3,000 anti-Castroites , former political prisoners whose promised exit from Cuba has been held up since the disruptive influx from Mariel . <P> The image of all 129,000 Marielitos in this country has been unfairly tainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few miscreants . Of the 2,746 who can now be returned to Cuba , about 2,200 have been convicted of crimes in the U.S. and the rest have been in custody ever since they disembarked in Key West , Fla . More than 1,500 are in a federal prison in Atlanta . The rest are in state and local jails and mental institutions . They will be sent back gradually , beginning in January , about 100 being flown out each month as their cases come up in federal court for review . <P> The 3,000 former political prisoners will get their visas as soon as the U.S. beefs up its staff in Havana to begin processing applications . More than 15,000 other Cubans have applied for regular visas , and in all , more than 20,000 may be permitted to immigrate in 1985 . During the 1960s and ' 70s , an average of about 26,000 Cubans arrived legally in the U.S. each year , reaching a peak of 70,000 during Jimmy Carter 's first year in office . Since the 1980 flotilla , fewer than 3,000 Cubans a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a serious possibility last year , Washington was inclined to discuss only the expulsion of the undesirables in U.S. custody . Cuba , however , won assurances that routine immigration procedures would be part of a deal too . The arrangement was worked out by Michael Kozak , a State Department lawyer , and Ricardo Alarcn de Quesada , a Cuban Foreign Ministry official , in three rounds of meetings in New York City , the most recent and important one just two weeks ago . <P> Even as it announced the small diplomatic success , however , the Administration wanted to make sure that nobody gets the wrong idea : Reagan has not gone soft on Cuban Communism . " The conclusion of an agreement on this issue does not signal any change in U.S. policy toward Cuba , " declared White House Spokesman Larry Speakes . " We are willing to talk-if Cuba shows signs it is willing to re-enter the family of nations in the Western hemisphere . So far their conduct remains totally unsatisfactory in the eyes of the U.S. "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
