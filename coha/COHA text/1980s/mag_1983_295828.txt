Two exhibits celebrate the giddy heights of fashion <P> On one point , anyway , there can be no argument . " La Belle Epoque , " the new show of period high fashion organized by Diana Vreeland for New York City 's Metropolitan Museum of Art and underwritten by Pierre Cardin , is an eyeful and a noseful . The eye is ravished by a theatrical assembly of more than 150 women 's , men 's and children 's costumes , representing thousands of yards of fabric coaxed into stunning shape with a skill and diligence that today can not be had anywhere outside of major surgery . The olfactory nerve , meantime , gets a good working over from L'Heure Bleue , a Guerlain scent that is sprayed every morning throughout the galleries . The senses reel . They are meant to . This is not art-if clothes may be called art at all-meant to be pondered and absorbed . This is curatorial show business of a particularly shrewd order . With the humble addition of a light show and the sale of Pharmaceuticals at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honestly promoted as a real time trip . <P> Vreeland 's ten previous collaborations with the museum 's Costume Institute have been both hot tickets and publicity bonanzas , and " La Belle Epoque " shows every sign of being a smash too . The women 's gowns of the era , which by Vreeland 's chronology developed in the last half of the 19th century and ended on the eve of the first World War , were opulent and imperial . They may have been the most extravagant fashion since the court of the Sun King . Worth , Doucet , Callot Soeurs , Poiret : the great fashion houses are all represented with gowns and dresses that seem to challenge , in some cases even exceed , the outer limits of craftsmanship . Who would have thought it possible for a bodice to be shaped in such a way , or for silk to fall so unhurriedly , like a dove on a light wind ? The clothes of this period were an exercise in sensual extravagance , not only of highflying technical virtuosity but of high-flown social aggression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quip that silenced a rival . Its beauty seemed inviolate : 19th century social armor . <P> The sensual suffocation of these grand clothes was modified and ventilated for outdoor wear . The looseness of a mohair duster , the easy lines of a woman 's blueserge bicycle suit , even a white wool polo coat from Brooks Brothers , all prefigure a less restrictive notion of sophistication . The summer whites of Newport are as dazzling to a contemporary eye as a violet satin costume brocaded in gold and silver , supposedly worn by Sarah Bernhardt . <P> There is a grandiose theatricality about the entire exhibition that , ultimately , gives the clothing a secondary role . For all the sensory overload-the perfume , rooms decorated ( courtesy of Cardin ) to look like Maxim 's , the Offenbach piped in like a sound track for an ancient travelogue- " La Belle Epoque " is less an evocation of mood or an exhibition of high style than it is an exaltation of swank , of money , of society . In that sense it is about fashion , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
